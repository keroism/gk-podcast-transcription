00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,521
Rym: It's Thursday, December 3rd, 2020.

2
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:12,963
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,610
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,309
Rym: We are talking about hair on your body.

5
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:21,207
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:26,689
Scott: All right, this is more Monday action, but whatever right.

7
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:40,564
Scott: so the advent of code is happening and even as a you know a non Christian person who doesn't care about any advents right advent of code is a really cool thing And I think because people are stuck at home this year It's like its fifth year.

8
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,006
Scott: Also.

9
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:44,659
Scott: It's bigger than ever right because people not have time to do it.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,311
Scott: If you don't know what it is what there's a person.

11
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:48,577
Scott: I don't know the person's name.

12
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:49,140
Scott: I could look it up.

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,644
Scott: I'm sorry.

14
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:50,995
Scott: I met them once at PAX East.

15
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:51,499
Scott: actually I was.

16
00:00:52,365 --> 00:01:01,755
Scott: I was where it was like for two seconds But I was working in the tabletop library and someone walks up to check out a game And they're wearing an advent of code shirt, and I'm like oh advent of code.

17
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,986
Scott: and the dude was like oh Oh, he was so happy.

18
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,634
Scott: He was like I'm the guy who made it.

19
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:07,806
Scott: I'm like whoa that's awesome Right.

20
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:10,259
Scott: and then they walked away, and I never saw them again.

21
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:20,390
Scott: But yeah, so what it is is Every day from December 1st through December 25th This website puts out a coding puzzle.

22
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:24,327
Scott: right it's not technically a coding puzzle But it does.

23
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:31,435
Scott: is there's a. there's a problem And they give you a text file with your inputs and your inputs are unique to use.

24
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:35,450
Scott: you can't just like crib off of someone Else's answer right and then there's a box.

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,106
Scott: you just have to type in the right answer into the box You could solve.

26
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:39,849
Scott: you know it.

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:44,207
Rym: any way you want someone in our forum already They posted their solution to one.

28
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:45,030
Rym: they use Excel.

29
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,075
Rym: That's totally valid.

30
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:47,300
Scott: you can use Excel.

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,802
Scott: I've see.

32
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:48,525
Scott: you can use bat.

33
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:50,133
Scott: You know, but it's like you could do it by hand.

34
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:51,620
Scott: right you could figure out the answer.

35
00:01:51,701 --> 00:02:08,496
Scott: But the problems are such that You're going to probably have to write a computer program of some kind But the inputs a text file so you can write in whatever language you want on whatever Platform you want and pretty much any silicon that you can get to help you is going to be able to get the job done.

36
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:12,909
Scott: and the problems get significantly harder as you get closer to Christmas.

37
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:15,254
Scott: and also each day actually has two problems.

38
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:25,171
Scott: and the second problem is Very real and each each day is a perfectly new thing But the two different problems on the same day are very related to each other.

39
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:38,020
Scott: and if you solve if the program you write To solve problem one on a particular day is well-written and very flexible You will be able to solve problem two with like a very minor change in a matter of seconds.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,840
Scott: So that is the danger using Excel to solve problem one sometimes even no changes.

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:53,990
Scott: But if you write something very specific and inflexible with not very good programming Then you'll solve problem one and then problem two you'll be like Start over right.

42
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:55,540
Scott: so it's a lot of fun.

43
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,136
Scott: I'm doing it this year that we have leaderboards that there's there's all kinds of things you can get involved with.

44
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:03,366
Scott: there's a competitive aspect Although you don't need to worry about that.

45
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,311
Scott: It's not really that competitive you.

46
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:07,517
Scott: basically it's impossible to compete.

47
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:08,259
Scott: don't even try.

48
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:10,707
Scott: so yeah doing that.

49
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:16,971
Scott: and I was thinking hey wouldn't it be fun if Maybe I could like stream myself solving it right is that?

50
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,095
Scott: or make a YouTube video?

51
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,520
Scott: would that be interesting content?

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,685
Scott: Maybe we'll find out.

53
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,313
Scott: I'm gonna try it later today.

54
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,082
Scott: I didn't do day three yet, right We'll see.

55
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:30,538
Scott: and then I was thinking how could I make it more interesting, and I'm like you know What if I solved it using like my Apple - oh?

56
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:35,519
Scott: That would be even more interesting right?

57
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,807
Rym: Well, you know point a camera at your Apple.

58
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,492
Scott: - well, so here's the problem.

59
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:47,145
Scott: an Apple - GS can't run OBS on that The I have a monitor for.

60
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,669
Scott: it uses an external monitor.

61
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:52,940
Scott: the external monitor uses a special RGB cable.

62
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:55,808
Scott: So I have to point a camera at the monitor.

63
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:56,390
Scott: that sucks.

64
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:58,476
Scott: There is a thing you can get.

65
00:03:58,496 --> 00:03:59,980
Scott: there's actually a few different solutions.

66
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,899
Scott: There's a whole web page full of different solutions to doing this.

67
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:06,191
Scott: But there's a thing called the vid HD.

68
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:10,130
Scott: you put it in a card slot in the Apple - GS And it creates an HDMI output.

69
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:11,499
Scott: I might buy one.

70
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:16,452
Scott: Not only would that make it much easier to use the Apple - GS.

71
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,640
Scott: It would mean I can get rid of that monitor.

72
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,191
Scott: I'm sure someone wants it because it's a working quality Apple - GS.

73
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:24,960
Rym: I'm confident you could give that away or sell it easily.

74
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,946
Scott: Yes, the Mac plus is even harder.

75
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:33,120
Scott: the Mac plus right has a problem in that the monitor is built in.

76
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,429
Scott: So you know it's one of those max.

77
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:37,635
Scott: It's an all-in-one unit.

78
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:38,600
Rym: I'll crack it open.

79
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,242
Scott: It works.

80
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:40,165
Rym: figure out the output.

81
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:41,791
Rym: that's going to the CRT.

82
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:43,116
Scott: you could do that.

83
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:45,278
Scott: people have done that yes But I'm not doing that.

84
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:49,114
Scott: But so I go today, and I'm thinking you know the Mac plus will be easier.

85
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:50,360
Scott: let me turn it on right.

86
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:54,954
Scott: So I go to turn on the Mac plus, and I got.

87
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,540
Scott: I have an external hard drive for it.

88
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,820
Scott: It's a 20 megabyte hard drive in an enclosure.

89
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:02,680
Scott: And I set it all up, and then I realized wait a minute.

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,533
Scott: Where is the cable that connects the hard drive to the computer?

91
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:07,039
Rym: Oh because that ain't USB I?

92
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,025
Scott: Can't find the cable.

93
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:10,790
Scott: I looked all over.

94
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:11,979
Scott: I don't know what the hell happened to it.

95
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:18,020
Rym: Hopefully you didn't accidentally purge it in a great cable purge because we've both done a bunch of cable purges recently.

96
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:25,600
Rym: I'm I don't know I may have but I used to always philosophy of I would keep if I saw a cable that I did not know I had another one of.

97
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:26,745
Rym: No matter what it was.

98
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,199
Rym: I would keep that one cable, so I had one of everything I'd ever owned.

99
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:39,007
Scott: But it doesn't matter because I got another better solution, there's apparently a product I was unaware of until just now.

100
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:41,156
Scott: I already ordered it because it was in stock.

101
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:56,877
Scott: these things tend to go Out-of-stock, it's called the floppy emu model C and what it is is it's a little board with an LCD screen on it even and An SD slot a micro SD slot and put out by BMW.

102
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:57,298
Rym: I know them.

103
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:57,659
Rym: They're cool.

104
00:05:58,506 --> 00:05:59,819
Rym: Yeah, big mess of wires.

105
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:05,054
Scott: Yep, it's got a cable and that cable goes to an Apple floppy port.

106
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,716
Scott: and you know what?

107
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:07,140
Scott: the Apple floppy port.

108
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:15,140
Scott: You know there's not a lot in common actually between the Apple to GS and the Mac plus even though they came out around The same ish time, but the floppy port is the same.

109
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:21,261
Scott: So this thing is gonna make it real easy to get all kinds of software going on both of those computers Right.

110
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:29,959
Scott: and if I get the HDMI thing I can get I can like keep these computers Use them more than the zero I've used them in years, right?

111
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,289
Scott: And it'll be I can get rid of stuff.

112
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,280
Scott: I can get rid of this 20 megabyte hard drive.

113
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,950
Scott: I can get rid of that monitor.

114
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,317
Scott: I can get rid of a lot of junk.

115
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:41,666
Scott: so Yeah, we'll see.

116
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:47,852
Scott: we'll see what's what there but regardless Come to my twitch or end or my youtube.

117
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:49,016
Scott: We're gonna see discord.

118
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:50,000
Scott: I'm gonna see what I can do.

119
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:58,189
Scott: And if you want to watch me code and solve a simple problem though the problems will get harder And we'll see how hard I can go.

120
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,542
Scott: I've never gone past like day 10.

121
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:07,660
Scott: So I'm not not that I failed on day 10 It's that I just you know haven't put in the time and this year I got a lot of time.

122
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:16,345
Rym: I feel like this year more people are gonna engage with things like this than they previously would because we're about to hit the very dark times both Psychologically and just.

123
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,671
Rym: it's literally dark outside.

124
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:19,460
Scott: Yeah, it's literally dark outside now.

125
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:29,162
Scott: So just for reference right on day two I stayed up until midnight to start because it's based on who gets it in first to score points on the global leader the global Leaderboard.

126
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:32,960
Scott: you need to be in the top 100 fastest people to solve your puzzle.

127
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:34,145
Scott: I tried to.

128
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:34,567
Scott: I like.

129
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:37,520
Scott: I know that coding nicely is just gonna make it slow.

130
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:38,784
Scott: Right to get your answer.

131
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:39,887
Rym: Oh, you got to write software.

132
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:49,140
Rym: That's hitting this website with curl and the software you write uses AI to read the text figure out the problem and write scaffold code for you.

133
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,189
Scott: So I just I coded as quickly.

134
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:51,872
Scott: I did not.

135
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:56,551
Scott: I could have done it a little bit faster Right if I had really pushed, but you know a certain reflex to like.

136
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,799
Scott: I had to write at least somewhat cleanly, right?

137
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,484
Scott: Yeah, I can't doing it.

138
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:06,600
Scott: It took me about 11 minutes for problem one and then 15 for problem two.

139
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:14,207
Scott: I think you know it didn't take that much difference and I came in 2,000 something place Wow.

140
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:20,715
Scott: and so that's how many people were doing it that quickly and you know by now Way more people have done it.

141
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:23,989
Scott: so Yeah, no don't bother competing though.

142
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:44,713
Scott: granted the problems are so easy early on In order to get points in the early days when the easy problems are out Your skills that are being tested are like fast reading fast typing right that sort of thing Whereas I think in the later days and the problems are substantially difficult and take a long time to solve Then those skills won't matter.

143
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:46,140
Scott: your programming skill will matter.

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,219
Rym: Yeah, like the live stream might be five minutes of you just sitting there, and then suddenly you go aha and type something or an hour.

145
00:08:54,561 --> 00:09:04,380
Rym: We'll see anyway, that's that's that that's good stuff, so there is actually huge news And it's lucky that it's not a Thursday, and it's easy just to talk about generically.

146
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:11,103
Rym: But this is this is a game changer for the entertainment industry, and I feel like People.

147
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:15,700
Rym: well companies like HBO like Netflix movie distributor.

148
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,300
Rym: There's a lot of people who've been wanting to do something like this for a long time.

149
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,877
Scott: This has basically been a Pandora's box that's been sitting there for a good five to ten years plus.

150
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:36,055
Scott: Maybe even yeah No Lizing no one with the power to do this was willing to do it And I've been just waiting for someone to do it like you cowards.

151
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:36,979
Scott: and here they go.

152
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:38,548
Scott: They're finally gonna do it.

153
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:59,379
Rym: Warner Brothers will release Every single movie that they make and put in release to theaters in 2021 Simultaneously will just be watchable digitally at home on HBO max For about a month, and then it'll go away, and then it'll come back later like in the normal streaming stuff.

154
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:06,568
Scott: So up until 2020 right Movie companies the big Hollywood ones at least.

155
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:12,724
Scott: if they made movies they always would release them first in the movie theater Exclusively right.

156
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:17,998
Scott: then they would release them on like a disc of some kind and then streaming of some kind.

157
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:23,298
Scott: right and the time Between the theater and the and the other wider home release kept shrinking.

158
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:26,020
Rym: right Yeah, but it would also days something would be in the theater.

159
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:30,340
Rym: You couldn't fucking see it again for a long time when it was out of theaters.

160
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:37,923
Scott: Then eventually there'd be a tape and then when I came right it might be on cable TV with like pay-per-view For a period.

161
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:44,440
Rym: the last last place it would appear would be on actual broadcast television with ads like sometimes years later.

162
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:54,430
Scott: And this was a method by which they were sort of artificially propping up the different Platforms on which their content would screen right.

163
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,680
Rym: people would basically pay at every step of the way.

164
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,180
Rym: They'd go see it in the theater, then they'd want to see it again.

165
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,760
Rym: They'd pay for a pay-per-view like a year later.

166
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:07,482
Rym: Then they'd buy the VHS like that was a. that was a way to get a maximum money Right.

167
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:10,210
Scott: well it was also a way to like keep theaters in business.

168
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:10,470
Scott: right.

169
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:19,070
Scott: the thinking was hey if a if the theater doesn't have if The theater just has the same movies you could watch at home Why would you go to the theater now?

170
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,098
Scott: theater would just go out of business right.

171
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:21,740
Rym: that argument?

172
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:31,956
Rym: Was kind of silly back then because the theater experience especially in like the 70s or the 80s Was just objectively better than the best you could possibly do at home.

173
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,150
Scott: Yep We're kind of like 4k TV at home.

174
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:44,160
Rym: Yep, so when the internet appeared Nobody wanted to touch this because that changes in everything internet modern screens modern sound systems.

175
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:45,366
Rym: That was just that.

176
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:53,700
Rym: like Scott said that was a Pandora's box that would destroy Everything we know about this industry and no one knows what it would look like after that had happened.

177
00:11:54,462 --> 00:12:10,880
Scott: But now what's happened is basically a pandemic has destroyed the movie theater Being destroyed if it's already destroyed Yep, and we've already had you saw companies testing the waters and doing like a limited.

178
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,958
Rym: Well, this movie will be on the streaming platform this one movie because of kovat.

179
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:17,085
Rym: But now what are brothers saying?

180
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:17,446
Rym: Fuck it.

181
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:18,228
Rym: This is everything.

182
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,518
Scott: Yeah, we've also seen minor things happening.

183
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:30,673
Scott: For example We've seen people like, you know They just make digital screeners of all the movies for the Hollywood people to see and the Oscar reviewers to see.

184
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:34,047
Scott: and you know all kinds of digital pre-releases For secret stuff.

185
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:35,940
Scott: right a film festivals been online.

186
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:38,970
Scott: You know, we watch Wolfwalkers at one of those right?

187
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:40,175
Scott: So it's like.

188
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:44,452
Scott: well, you're already doing that It's like and people are leaking those too.

189
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:49,553
Scott: So You know, you're kind of are sort of releasing it digitally first.

190
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:56,360
Scott: Yeah to the Pirates at least You know, why not at least get money for that do it by some means.

191
00:12:57,223 --> 00:13:00,878
Scott: And also, I don't know people realize this there was a rule an old rule.

192
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:04,879
Scott: It's been around for a long time for a lot of reasons.

193
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:11,698
Scott: Yes, it was an antitrust rule and the rule in the United States was if you're the movie maker, right?

194
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:15,288
Scott: You're Disney You can't own the movie theater.

195
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:23,337
Scott: because if you own the movie theater and you made the movies Right if you made the VCRs and also the movies, it's like oh you got it.

196
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:24,160
Scott: now you got to buy.

197
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,700
Scott: You know, it's the same way that like, you know, basically it's what Nintendo did on purpose, right?

198
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,280
Scott: Where it's like aha you want to get your video game on a Nintendo console.

199
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,312
Scott: You got to make our cartridge and get our approved by us, right?

200
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:38,920
Scott: It's the same thing the Apple App Store does right?

201
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,999
Rym: I think about the old Hollywood studio system.

202
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:49,579
Rym: Like imagine if literally like AMC makes a movie and you can only go see it in AMC theaters And they can only buy the AMC disc.

203
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,330
Scott: Yep, it'd be like, okay.

204
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,020
Scott: Well now someone else wants to make a movie.

205
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:59,360
Scott: They can't get it onto screens anywhere because they're not the company that owns the screens.

206
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,673
Scott: The only movies that would ever be in theaters would be the Disney movies.

207
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:07,279
Scott: if Disney owns all the movie theaters Right the end they wouldn't let anyone else show movies.

208
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:15,965
Rym: Yeah, you see a lot of anti-competitive practices like there was a time when our government was interested in Forcing the market to be more fair.

209
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:18,773
Rym: Our government hasn't been interested in that in some time.

210
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:28,480
Scott: So one thing is that a It's things have changed and that yeah even if Disney owns all the theaters They can't stop you from putting out a movie because you just put it out.

211
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,227
Scott: Anyone can just put out a movie you get.

212
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:36,919
Scott: everyone's could just go to the store buy a camera if you got enough money Yeah, or a video edit it on your computer with Adobe or something free.

213
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:43,838
Rym: I mean, I subscribe to a patreon where Neil Cicierega will guarantee me a video on a regular basis, right?

214
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:45,525
Scott: It's like You know.

215
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,139
Scott: anyone can make video content.

216
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:48,687
Scott: You know, there's Disney.

217
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:55,020
Scott: if even if they bottle the movie theaters isn't holding people back But they could keep you out of the movie theaters.

218
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:59,394
Scott: If movie theaters are still a thing that people care about right?

219
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:04,050
Rym: Yeah, but movie theaters We're already moribund from what I gather.

220
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,639
Rym: I was poking around into like what's the real state of the theater business?

221
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:14,280
Rym: Irrespective of kovat not good theaters are only doing well in major cities because there's a different dynamic there.

222
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,230
Rym: There's different reasons.

223
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:22,620
Rym: people go to theaters But yeah in suburbs in more rural places and if people like people have a objectively better experience at home.

224
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:30,280
Scott: I think also what we've seen over the course of I guess the entire millennium, right?

225
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:43,189
Scott: I want to say since like, you know Maybe episodes Star Wars Episode 1 came out and ish times right the movie theater has become An event type place, right?

226
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,380
Rym: I mean look at a fathom events, right?

227
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,340
Scott: There are some people who go to a movie theater to still just see movies all the time.

228
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:54,400
Scott: You know big-time movie people who just love the hell out of movies.

229
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:07,079
Scott: Yeah but I think the majority of people who go to a movie theater do it because like you're having a kid's birthday party there or something like that or There's a movie that's just like so up your alley you got to see it right away.

230
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:15,437
Rym: Occasionally a movie is like one of those cinema Movies that just is better to watch on a screen that is that big like.

231
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:16,140
Rym: there's some more.

232
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:22,039
Scott: I think the number one people reason people go to a movie theater right is there's an event type.

233
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,889
Rym: movie Director is gonna give commentary after.

234
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:26,190
Scott: well, no.

235
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:31,167
Scott: No, I mean like, you know, just like the new Movies coming out right?

236
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:32,531
Scott: It's a big fucking event.

237
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:35,460
Scott: you line up at midnight and shit not event at a specific theater.

238
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,906
Rym: You're like Star Wars came out.

239
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,131
Rym: It's the next Star Wars movie.

240
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,400
Rym: people are gonna talk about it tomorrow, right?

241
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,560
Scott: It's like you're going to see that shit in the theater.

242
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,020
Scott: You if that even if that was out on DVD on the internet at home at the same exact time.

243
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,659
Scott: It's like you're going to the theater.

244
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:59,119
Rym: Yeah but we've already seen theater usage demographics changing a lot like look at the Crazy success of like Alamo Drafthouse and all the people copying them of radically changing what the theater is.

245
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:02,186
Scott: Right, they make the theater is now go.

246
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:06,740
Scott: I think what's gonna happen is your the movie theater will not die completely.

247
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:12,440
Scott: but the movie theater instead of being a thing that is No matter where you are in the u.s.

248
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,560
Scott: There's a movie theater nearby where you can see the latest movie somewhere, but they're all interchangeable and generic, right?

249
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,663
Scott: I think instead what you're gonna see is those are gonna go away replaced by if you just want to watch movies You just watch them at home.

250
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:25,573
Scott: Yeah, right the movie theater.

251
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:25,954
Scott: You're all.

252
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:27,079
Scott: you're gonna go to a theater.

253
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:40,138
Scott: There will be one near you but there will be about as many as there are like Concert halls like going to a movie will be an event like going to a concert which kind of gets back to how early movie theaters Were the old show palaces?

254
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,279
Scott: Exactly, that's how movies and that's how movies like going.

255
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:51,950
Scott: I said, let's tell that's how going to the theater for a movie has been for me for many many New York for the last decade.

256
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,260
Rym: we rarely like just go to the theater see a movie and leave.

257
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:59,360
Rym: We'll like meet all our friends at a theater watch the movie together and then go out for a big dinner.

258
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,349
Rym: It's always like a we only and any time.

259
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,620
Scott: I've gone to the movies many times.

260
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:16,630
Scott: But every single time I can think of in like years of memory that I went to the movies It was always some kind of like a big deal thing Like there was an anime showing one night only there was.

261
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:19,378
Scott: we went to go see something in 70 millimeter.

262
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:21,706
Scott: big deal Special limited thing.

263
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:27,730
Scott: the director was there was a film festival It was a Star Wars it or it was.

264
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:29,417
Scott: every single time went to the movie.

265
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:30,160
Scott: It was a big deal.

266
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,782
Scott: It was never.

267
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:36,960
Scott: oh, there's a movie that you know, like I like and it's in the theater now and it'll be on DVD later.

268
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:38,031
Scott: Let me go to the theater and watch.

269
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:38,840
Scott: I never do that.

270
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,144
Rym: I still do the latter a lot.

271
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:49,339
Rym: well did but outside of kovin except it's only really old movies at Theaters that have something else going on like they serve you brunch while you're watching it.

272
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,507
Scott: You know, but that's more.

273
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:53,390
Scott: you're going to brunch.

274
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:53,851
Scott: They're happy.

275
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:54,534
Rym: I'm going to brunch.

276
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:56,480
Rym: I happen to watch vampire hunter D over.

277
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,042
Rym: You're right.

278
00:18:57,062 --> 00:19:01,160
Scott: You're not going to vampire hunter and I'll see you're not going to vampire hunter D and there happens to be brunch.

279
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:05,043
Rym: Oh, it actually yeah, they cut it was that Sometimes.

280
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:07,319
Scott: yeah, also vampire hunter D is a special event.

281
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,424
Rym: They show it kind of right.

282
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,954
Rym: they do midnight showings of vampire hunter D pretty regularly there.

283
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:12,597
Rym: Yeah.

284
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:13,420
Scott: Well they did.

285
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:16,027
Rym: I think they'll survive.

286
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:17,856
Scott: I think I was already planning.

287
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,704
Scott: by the way, Mike You know, I only try to.

288
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:22,195
Scott: I try to you know, switch my subscriptions around.

289
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:25,251
Rym: Oh, I was like, yeah We were both talking off the outside of the show.

290
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:29,972
Rym: We were both saying like wow HBO Max seems to be like where we should.

291
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:32,320
Scott: I mentioned it during our show on the new adventure time.

292
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,944
Scott: You know before.

293
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:38,892
Scott: my current subscriptions are crunchy rolling Netflix And I guess I always have Amazon Prime just always because you know, whatever.

294
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:50,039
Scott: but yeah, I think that if When this happens probably, you know, I'm probably gonna turn off Netflix temporarily and turn back on HBO Max and I'll have HBO Max

295
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:55,339
Rym: Dragon prince is gonna come out on Netflix like four more seasons of that real soon

296
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:57,010
Scott: Yeah, but I can switch by the.

297
00:19:57,473 --> 00:19:58,560
Scott: that's always gonna be there.

298
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,146
Scott: So whenever I done with HBO Max I'll switch back to Netflix in what?

299
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:06,989
Scott: two year three year one year whenever I'm in a year and all those dragon princes will be There waiting for me.

300
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:12,336
Rym: Yeah Yeah going anywhere, but I think I think a few things are gonna happen.

301
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:24,482
Rym: I think one we're gonna see companies like HBO and Netflix buy theaters out of bankruptcy post COVID and just run special screenings and things Like.

302
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:30,800
Rym: that's gonna be a thing - I think we're gonna see Alamo Drafthouse will sort of turn into the default.

303
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:35,780
Scott: I think you're gonna see something like oh, by the way, I heard I don't know if this how true this is.

304
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,607
Scott: I should look it up more before saying it.

305
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:40,840
Scott: So I'm gonna say research this for yourself to see if it's true.

306
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:51,112
Scott: But I I heard whispers that the people who run Alamo Drafthouse specifically that company are like Waybad and shitty type people or maybe the CEO is shitty or something like that.

307
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:54,623
Scott: heard bad milkshake duck type news about them Specifically.

308
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:56,489
Scott: go verify it for yourself.

309
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:00,060
Scott: But I you know, we're talking not just about that company specifically.

310
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:07,180
Scott: But yeah, just but that's you know, any theater any theater that has assigned fancy seats with dinner?

311
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:10,613
Rym: Oh, I refuse to go to any fucking theater that doesn't have assigned seats.

312
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,360
Rym: That's been my thing for a long time.

313
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:16,070
Scott: When's the last time I went to a theater that wasn't an assigned?

314
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,440
Rym: because I'm unwilling to get with the I live with assigned seats.

315
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,599
Rym: The magic is I can roll into the theater 20 seconds before the movie starts and just sit down.

316
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:27,475
Scott: You know, the the Museum of the moving image doesn't assign.

317
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:31,000
Rym: you see that is true But I've never like gone to that.

318
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,600
Rym: I've never tried to see something there and like so many people showed up so early that I didn't get a good seat.

319
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:42,892
Rym: yeah, it's never it's never happened, but I think you know, there's the Japanese style karaoke places.

320
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:43,214
Rym: We're like.

321
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:44,000
Rym: there's private rooms.

322
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:54,800
Rym: I think you're gonna see some theaters that are really crazy fancy sound system and good seats and everything But in smaller semi-private rooms that like groups will get together and watch movies in similar.

323
00:21:54,941 --> 00:22:01,325
Scott: I would like to see I think that is you know with the fathom events thing and people I don't know how many people know About it's like opera bands.

324
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:02,669
Rym: We're gonna get opera boxes for movies.

325
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:10,200
Scott: fathom events is a company where you know It'd be really hard if like we filmed the GeekNights thing to get it on the screen in a movie theater.

326
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:15,900
Scott: Right, but and there's a lot of companies that are smaller distributors, you know, like Funimation for example, right?

327
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,300
Scott: They make some anime and they want to screen this anime movie that they just licensed in theaters in the US like a one-night-only thing.

328
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:28,820
Scott: Fathom events is sort of like an in-between company that helps you get your shit onto theater screens and they get all these theater.

329
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:43,000
Scott: You know and there's a bunch of movie theaters out there that I got a shit ton of screens and there aren't that many big Movies, so yeah for one night, you know, sure They'll take one of the screens that isn't showing the top movie and show whatever Funimation wants to show.

330
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,228
Scott: They'll show Broadway shows in their concerts.

331
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,999
Scott: They got all kinds of random one-night-only.

332
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:56,996
Scott: It makes the movie theater and it makes fathom and the distributor more money than if they had showed The least popular Hollywood movie at the time on that screen.

333
00:22:57,096 --> 00:23:02,980
Rym: one more showing Yeah, but also imagine if like Netflix like they're like, this is just like the business idea.

334
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,080
Rym: I could see a company like Netflix making a place that looks like a karaoke place.

335
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:12,456
Rym: But it's all these little private comfortable rooms that have like ultra high quality Netflix original.

336
00:23:12,556 --> 00:23:13,800
Scott: I don't think little rooms.

337
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:21,383
Scott: I think that your fathom events type model will be taken to the next level where you instead Choose it.

338
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:26,918
Scott: There's some sort of user input on what will be screened right in the big theater.

339
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:30,109
Rym: So it's like yeah Both I think they'll see.

340
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:40,108
Scott: there's a theater near you and in theater seven doesn't have anything for an eight o'clock showing tonight and People are gonna be like, you know choosing like.

341
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:51,160
Scott: I really want to see this new maybe a new movie a Netflix original movie came out something and you're - you choose that and then it's like you go to the theater and it ends up that app app it.

342
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,964
Scott: That's what's popular.

343
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:54,660
Scott: So that ends up showing that you know what I can see at eight o'clock.

344
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:06,658
Rym: Here's an example see it the Disney theater shows the new Mandalorian at a specific time every like week and People buy tickets to go like see it first and hang out with all the other people who saw it first.

345
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:08,567
Scott: Yeah, people would do that.

346
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:11,660
Scott: people who are you know social show watching type people.

347
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:12,405
Rym: I think that's it.

348
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:13,613
Rym: You're gonna see a like.

349
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:24,529
Rym: there is So much that's going to change in the movie industry over the next decade because of the thing that happened today at 1 30 p.m Eastern Standard Time.

350
00:24:25,357 --> 00:24:29,088
Rym: Oh, yeah Like we're not we're not experts in this space.

351
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:32,380
Rym: Like you're gonna see industry people talking about this for years.

352
00:24:33,161 --> 00:24:40,219
Scott: Well, someone finally had the balls to do what we always knew could be done could have been done a long time ago But yeah now it's gonna be a pandemic made happen.

353
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:42,006
Rym: So you had some news.

354
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:46,221
Rym: Emily actually was telling me this story and I didn't read the article because Emily kind of explained it To me.

355
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:50,960
Rym: but that the the news article that you gave me to talk about today is pretty good, right?

356
00:24:51,382 --> 00:24:53,051
Scott: So I'm not gonna explain all the details.

357
00:24:53,072 --> 00:24:58,752
Scott: you can read them yourself, right but There was an unidentified object like in space, right?

358
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:01,000
Scott: They were seeing it and they were like, is that an asteroid?

359
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,211
Rym: Like what is they're like, no, it's not an asteroid.

360
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:03,855
Rym: We know it.

361
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,242
Rym: We don't know what it is It's something.

362
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:11,697
Scott: so they looked at it and basically their guess Was that you know in the in the 60s?

363
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,646
Scott: When they were trying to go to the moon, right before they had like, you know Saturn five rockets.

364
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:38,434
Scott: a different rocket they had before then was the centaur rocket and One of the rockets they sent up in the 60s You know as a multi-stage deal, right and one of the stages One of the the upper booster stage went missing in the 60s and they saw it and somebody real smart said I bet That's what that is.

365
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:42,452
Scott: That's that that booster that we lost in the 60s.

366
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:44,077
Scott: But how can you know?

367
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:45,100
Scott: How can you know?

368
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,452
Scott: It's just like a dot of light in space.

369
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:48,980
Scott: That's like blinking or whatever the fuck.

370
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,300
Scott: How do you know what the hell that is, right?

371
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,799
Scott: You look at it with your telescope and shit and it's just like you can't visually identify it, right?

372
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,182
Scott: It's like you would need to zoom in so much it's like we don't have.

373
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:06,006
Rym: like most modern astronomy is just in like inferring information from the photons themselves in ways that you perceive.

374
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:11,652
Scott: so the way you identify it is Basically with spectronomy, right?

375
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,280
Scott: I guess is that the right word, right?

376
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:27,282
Scott: You look at the spectrum of electromagnetic waves that it is reflecting because most Materials in the world right have a unique right spectrum of electromagnetic waves that they reflect versus Absorb.

377
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:29,228
Scott: compared to what the Sun puts out.

378
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:37,019
Scott: right the Sun puts out like fucking everything from infrared to ultraviolet, you know all over the place Right, I guess not everything but a very wide spectrum, right?

379
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,280
Rym: Our Sun is not outputting those high-energy photons that come like cosmic rays that come from out in deep space.

380
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,846
Rym: I hope not Happening we're in trouble right?

381
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:50,288
Scott: and that stuff that light from the Sun hits I don't know a leaf.

382
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:51,660
Scott: and what does the leaf reflect?

383
00:26:51,960 --> 00:27:00,900
Scott: Well, it reflects the green light in the visible spectrum But it also reflects, you know electromagnetic waves in other parts of the spectrum that just aren't visible, right?

384
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:01,746
Scott: It's gonna.

385
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:09,300
Scott: that's why so many things are green But they might still be unique if you can if you use like an infrared camera or ultraviolet camera or even wider.

386
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:17,465
Scott: You know the widest spectrum you can look at - and you could by taking a camera that can see all the different wavelengths Pointing it at different objects.

387
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:27,176
Scott: You could say what that is with a very high likely, you know hood of being correct because objects are really unique, you know, but materials wise right.

388
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:31,631
Scott: so They know what the booster rocket was made of right?

389
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:32,574
Scott: They're like there was.

390
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:34,100
Scott: they thought there was paint on it.

391
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,319
Scott: They know that this part was made of stainless steel.

392
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:39,744
Scott: This part was made of foam, you know And they can look at it.

393
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:48,152
Scott: and they could also point at another known objects that are made of the same materials Right and compare what they're seeing.

394
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:49,979
Scott: and that's how they figured out that.

395
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:54,359
Scott: yeah It's almost certain that this is exactly what that is in space over there.

396
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:59,250
Scott: So very very cool Science action going.

397
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,157
Rym: it is super cool.

398
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:09,500
Scott: One also, it's always I always like finding a lost object right like a sunken ship, you know I don't know how many people remember how big a deal it was.

399
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:22,873
Scott: It's like yeah, we know the Titanic sank but like they didn't remember that They didn't find the Titanic on the bottom of the sea until like I was old enough to read That was all anyone talked about on TV for like a year.

400
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:29,480
Scott: There was a National Geographic issue That was like 100% filled with photos of the Titanic from the bottom of the sea.

401
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,767
Scott: They're like we fucking found it.

402
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:31,612
Rym: Holy shit.

403
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:33,160
Rym: I remember not that long ago.

404
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,579
Scott: They found it was so and that was so big and it was on earth.

405
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,039
Scott: It wasn't even in space and it took him that long to find it.

406
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,208
Rym: Remember we when I got I freaked out on GeekNights.

407
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:46,298
Rym: It wasn't that long ago when they found the Erebus and the terror up in the Arctic.

408
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,500
Scott: Finding this is much, you know, not too many people cared about where this was.

409
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,140
Scott: It's not like there were any people in it, but it was more like by God.

410
00:28:56,161 --> 00:29:00,100
Scott: Finding this was actually probably much harder than finding the Titanic.

411
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:03,631
Scott: It's so small and then even fight.

412
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:05,340
Scott: they weren't looking for this to find it.

413
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,312
Scott: They saw a thing by chance and then identified it.

414
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:10,080
Rym: So it was a literal UFO.

415
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:16,300
Scott: Yeah, if it hadn't appeared I don't think you would have found this until we had like, you know easy go to space.

416
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:25,403
Rym: It is with the limited capabilities that humans have on this planet today If we ever see something in space that we don't do that We can't explain.

417
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:29,336
Rym: it is very important to try to figure out what the fuck it is as fast as possible.

418
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:30,380
Scott: Oh, yeah.

419
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:35,764
Rym: So in one last little news so the American election like.

420
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:37,329
Rym: obviously Joe Biden won like that.

421
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:43,840
Rym: that's not disputed by anyone except crazy people, but We hit a weird milestone.

422
00:29:44,421 --> 00:29:52,898
Rym: Biden so far has won the popular vote by seven million and it's still growing as they continue to count states like New York.

423
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,546
Rym: This is actually one of the big.

424
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:59,740
Rym: this might be the biggest blowout in like modern American history.

425
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:03,671
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, it's a terrifying and also good.

426
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:07,000
Scott: It's like it's like both sides right because on the one hand, right?

427
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:14,465
Scott: It's like if you consider all past elections that have ever happened in the United States for president This might have been the most important one.

428
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:20,983
Scott: Well, Donald Trump got more votes than any previous Person.

429
00:30:21,526 --> 00:30:27,769
Scott: right popular vote wise there were more Legitimate votes for Donald Trump than any president ever.

430
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:32,766
Scott: with the number of votes Donald Trump just got he could have beaten Obama both times Right.

431
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:34,260
Scott: Yeah, he just got that many votes.

432
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,760
Scott: Biden got seven plus million more votes than that.

433
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:42,817
Rym: There are more good people than bad.

434
00:30:42,877 --> 00:30:43,160
Rym: people.

435
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:45,432
Scott: Are seven million more?

436
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:46,820
Rym: the election looks a lot.

437
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,005
Scott: Do you want to get in a fight?

438
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:51,920
Scott: Do you want to have your gang fight another gang when the other gang is seven million?

439
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,784
Scott: bigger than your game But I don't want to do that.

440
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:59,716
Scott: that that really underscores like the especially even if it's 70 million for 77 million.

441
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:02,893
Scott: Seven million is scared.

442
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:04,764
Scott: Yeah 70 is well.

443
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:07,356
Rym: that could also be six million nine or nine thousand nine and ninety.

444
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:17,095
Scott: nine versus one Right, but I'm saying even if it's a hundred million people in a fight against a hundred and seven million people hundred million people need to be scared.

445
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:19,198
Scott: You're not gonna win.

446
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:19,962
Scott: But

447
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:39,120
Rym: that's the sort of the news that if you're not like familiar with US politics just to think about the election was a blowout Except America is set up to make to ensure that rural votes count a lot more than urban votes Such that the vast majority like the far majority of Americans voted for the correct option.

448
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,026
Rym: Yet everything was close.

449
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:46,480
Rym: And in fact, there are losses at the local level because of gerrymandering and rural overrepresentation.

450
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:53,035
Rym: Mmm, which goes all the way back to the founding of America when they hide your old news.

451
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:54,359
Scott: Yeah, is that even news?

452
00:31:57,442 --> 00:32:04,693
Scott: It's one thing to use a new when you sometimes you use a news that's like, you know Oh, I heard that last month using the news as 200 years old.

453
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:05,777
Rym: be careful with that news.

454
00:32:05,898 --> 00:32:09,096
Scott: It's an antique 250 years old probably I think.

455
00:32:09,116 --> 00:32:10,944
Scott: yeah, well 50 year old.

456
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:14,157
Rym: well, remember the Constitution wasn't written until well after the revolution.

457
00:32:14,197 --> 00:32:14,820
Rym: we had that whole.

458
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:17,951
Scott: Yeah, but but they but the bicentennial was 1970 something.

459
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:24,193
Rym: Yeah, which was silly because all you not Americans Remember you might not realize I don't know if they even teach you this.

460
00:32:24,614 --> 00:32:31,808
Rym: when America got independence We founded this bullshit government that just sucked and after like a decade we were like wow Fuck this.

461
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:32,679
Rym: and we rewrote it all.

462
00:32:33,781 --> 00:32:35,912
Rym: Yep, I don't think they teach that outside of the you.

463
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:36,394
Rym: I should do.

464
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:37,400
Scott: they taught it to me.

465
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:38,527
Scott: But yeah, we should do it again.

466
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:44,517
Scott: Maybe I think we're getting close to that But we had to make sure that you know, the bad people aren't allowed to participate.

467
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:45,140
Rym: Yep.

468
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:51,724
Rym: Also, there's a lot of evidence that when the Constitution was written part of the reason why it had ended in the state It did like.

469
00:32:51,784 --> 00:33:02,542
Rym: literally there's even a big like article and like an analysis of this The people who were actually writing it were bored and sick of this shit and just wanted to be done and they all just voted To like.

470
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:05,940
Rym: that's good enough because they assumed we'd fix it later and we never did.

471
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,666
Scott: Yeah, that's why they put in the amendment rule.

472
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:13,511
Scott: Yep, and we kind of just used it that they immediately used it Like ten times plus right away.

473
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:18,160
Scott: Yeah, they're like, hey we you know Cuz they were writing it at a literal meeting together in his place.

474
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:30,304
Rym: They wanted to go home and then just kind of stopped like the last few though that last few amendments didn't do much anyway.

475
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:32,740
Rym: things Of the day, what do you got?

476
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,866
Scott: What was my thing today?

477
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:37,020
Scott: Oh, yeah, so I'm sure you've all played minesweeper.

478
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:44,334
Scott: I think I've had several minesweeper things of the day which I think is an over Representation compared to how often I play minesweeper, which is not often.

479
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:45,820
Rym: I used to play it a lot.

480
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:47,307
Rym: There was a time when that was very.

481
00:33:47,428 --> 00:33:48,654
Scott: it was a time when I played a lot.

482
00:33:48,674 --> 00:33:52,766
Scott: that time is not recently but I don't know if you know the website itch.io.

483
00:33:52,867 --> 00:34:06,340
Scott: itch.io is a great website where indie game makers mostly but you know You can sell pretty much any digital goods on there But it's mostly games tabletop RPG PDFs, you know that sort of thing And so there's a lot of great stuff on there.

484
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:13,487
Scott: they actually recently on Black Friday what they did is they had a special day where they gave the itch.io took no cut and they gave.

485
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:20,208
Scott: when you bought something in itch.io all the money went to the developer or You know designer or artist whatever and that was nice.

486
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:22,757
Scott: that I think is over now, but it'll come again.

487
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:23,079
Scott: I'm sure.

488
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:27,762
Scott: Regardless there is a platform called Pico 8.

489
00:34:27,762 --> 00:34:41,275
Scott: I saw this on display most prominently when we were at gamer X and this amazing creator Driggs I think that's how you pronounce their name and They had like this game with a spider like a web and it was like this amazing.

490
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:54,000
Scott: It's basically a. Basically Pico 8 is a fake video game console that never existed and you can make games for it as if it did exist And run them on your normal computer, right and it basically provides these sort of limitations.

491
00:34:54,681 --> 00:35:05,010
Scott: Right as if you are programming a game for like this limited old, you know computer with only so much anyway Somebody named Numachi Tamanegi.

492
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,018
Scott: I'm probably pronouncing their name wrong.

493
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:09,906
Scott: I'm sorry Not I'm the last Tamanegi?

494
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:11,811
Scott: Tamanegi Tamanegi.

495
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:13,877
Scott: I don't know where to Tamanegi, whatever.

496
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:20,860
Scott: Sorry, so This person made a game called artemis's artemis minesweeper, right?

497
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,436
Scott: It's an apostrophe after the end of the s because it's the minesweeper that belongs to artemis.

498
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:26,560
Scott: It's a possessive, right?

499
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:30,949
Scott: And it's minesweeper except there's this character.

500
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,253
Scott: I presume their name is artemis.

501
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:40,289
Scott: Yeah, it's like a kraken monster girl right and they're shooting at you as if it is some sort of bullet hell shmup.

502
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:46,090
Scott: and While you're solving the little minesweeper which under normal circumstances would be an easy minesweeper.

503
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:50,570
Scott: Your mouse cursor has to dodge all this bullet hell bullets.

504
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:55,706
Scott: It is so hard and also if you click a bomb you don't die.

505
00:35:55,947 --> 00:36:01,057
Scott: You don't lose immediately You just take damage the same amount of damage You would have taken if you got hit by a bullet.

506
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:03,006
Scott: and you lose if your health runs out.

507
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:05,849
Scott: you win if you solve the Minesweeper before your health runs out.

508
00:36:06,452 --> 00:36:08,118
Scott: It's an amazing game that they were.

509
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:09,604
Scott: I can't believe they're able to make that.

510
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:11,090
Scott: come up with a genius idea.

511
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:15,003
Scott: Get it to run on pico 8 and look so good and work so smoothly.

512
00:36:15,023 --> 00:36:16,970
Scott: and here it is on itch.io.

513
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:18,515
Scott: You can just go play it.

514
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:22,590
Scott: I think you can also pay what you want for it because it's itch.io.

515
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:23,722
Scott: That's usually how that works.

516
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:24,369
Scott: Let me take a look.

517
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:30,047
Scott: I keep miss clicking because I don't even think you can pay for it directly.

518
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:30,970
Scott: It just says download.

519
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:32,624
Scott: They just download links and comments.

520
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:37,630
Scott: I don't think there's any Purchasing button for this game specifically whatsoever.

521
00:36:39,112 --> 00:36:40,802
Scott: Let's see view all by this person.

522
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:41,767
Scott: Do they have other games?

523
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:54,086
Scott: Oh, there's Tsunamaki junk and boss battle, right Pico 8 tic-tac-toe pico 8 juggle, which is just a game and watch with a guy playing ball.

524
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:56,835
Scott: a Lot of pico 8 games going on here.

525
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,379
Scott: Very nice new machi.

526
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,787
Scott: follow new machi on itch.

527
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:05,049
Rym: I have done so No, so on Twitter, so I got a real simple thing of the day.

528
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:12,030
Rym: There's the article's old but I came across this because people were talking about it recently for some reason and I didn't know it existed.

529
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:18,130
Rym: It's a breakdown of the Soviet laser space pistol that was intended to arm.

530
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:22,320
Rym: So here's the cool thing.

531
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,538
Rym: it was real but it wasn't to attack people it was to attack Satellites and sensors.

532
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:46,770
Rym: It's a gun that uses chemical cartridges and electricity That would basically expend these cartridges to shoot out huge amounts of photons and electrons basically to Destroy satellite sensors and attack like things that could be used to wage war in space.

533
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:51,825
Rym: So you couldn't really shoot a person with it, but you could shoot a satellite with.

534
00:37:51,865 --> 00:37:53,874
Scott: you could shoot a person with it Just wouldn't do much.

535
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:54,920
Rym: Yeah, I guess it could.

536
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:59,950
Rym: if you shot a person in the face with this I'm pretty sure would permanently blind them if you shot him right in the eye.

537
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:07,050
Rym: It basically is a super super powerful laser that only goes off for like a tiny tiny fraction of time.

538
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,888
Scott: Hmm, but if you shoot it right into like a camera sensor, it's like it the digital camera sensor.

539
00:38:11,928 --> 00:38:12,270
Scott: It's done.

540
00:38:12,431 --> 00:38:16,150
Rym: I mean if you point a good camera like right at the Sun you're gonna fuck it up, right?

541
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,530
Scott: If you shoot it right at some film, it's done, right?

542
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,290
Scott: You know, it's like, you know most set and digital sensors just cameras.

543
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,226
Rym: So the article is pretty cool because it actually talks about like how it worked why it was made.

544
00:38:26,286 --> 00:38:36,862
Rym: like they had to deal with Stuff like it had to not mess up the atmosphere or be toxic like inside of a space station Because you would use it like in a space station like shoot it out the window.

545
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:40,020
Scott: Oh You should out the window.

546
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:41,110
Scott: you wouldn't like go outside.

547
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,559
Rym: You could also go out and use it.

548
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,370
Rym: so it also had to work in the vacuum of space.

549
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:47,642
Scott: I was gonna say I think that's why it's full of the chemicals, right?

550
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:49,670
Rym: Yep, but you can read the article.

551
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,390
Rym: I'm not even gonna try to explain all the details.

552
00:38:51,513 --> 00:38:52,189
Rym: There's a lot here.

553
00:38:52,290 --> 00:39:11,648
Rym: But this shit is fascinating because this was the era where like the u.s And the Soviet Union were very much trying to like prepare to wage war in space but at the same time they were over focusing on certain aspects that are today irrelevant and also kind of like.

554
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:16,483
Rym: They were so close to understanding what modern space warfare would actually look like.

555
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:20,669
Rym: but yet they kind of just missed the mark and went Off in a crazy town both them and us.

556
00:39:21,672 --> 00:39:26,777
Scott: Yeah, I mean have you seen moonraker In the meta moment?

557
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:31,076
Scott: we're still stuck at home Mmm, I thought about reading that book.

558
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:34,146
Rym: I also thought about it, but I'm still reading that nonfiction book at elections.

559
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:37,640
Scott: Mm-hmm I'm reading the Adventure Time comic.

560
00:39:38,505 --> 00:39:39,490
Rym: Oh, I gotta read more of that.

561
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:41,538
Rym: I read a bunch and I kind of just stopped.

562
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,642
Scott: it was really good.

563
00:39:42,662 --> 00:39:43,244
Scott: It's really good.

564
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:44,750
Scott: I guess tiny review, right?

565
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,393
Scott: It's really good.

566
00:39:45,454 --> 00:39:52,012
Scott: At least I'm only in volume one or two and there's a lot of them But it's very Like it's.

567
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:57,170
Scott: you know, when you read comics you usually want they're usually fast to read like manga is like the fastest to read.

568
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,114
Scott: It's like whoosh, right?

569
00:39:58,536 --> 00:39:59,440
Scott: This is slow to read.

570
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,710
Scott: It's kind of wordy and it's the wordy.

571
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,609
Scott: It has a lot of words and there's also like tiny words at the bottom of some of the pages that are hidden.

572
00:40:06,629 --> 00:40:07,404
Scott: you want to read those too.

573
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:10,422
Rym: You know, it's funny because the my little pony it's not.

574
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:10,623
Scott: it's.

575
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:16,026
Rym: we're slow to do But not because of the words because of all the weird fiddly little details and everything.

576
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:20,790
Scott: Yeah, exactly It's like you read an old Stan Lee comic and it's got a bunch of words.

577
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,195
Scott: But those words are corny words.

578
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:26,950
Scott: Like I hit you you little guy and explain a science explain a science explain a science.

579
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,335
Scott: That's why is such and such as such.

580
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:32,210
Rym: I read an x-men floppy in like 60 seconds, right?

581
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:35,121
Scott: The words in here are not corny words.

582
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:36,165
Scott: They're at their Adventure Time.

583
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:37,230
Scott: dialogue, right?

584
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,538
Scott: This is just jam-packed.

585
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:42,630
Scott: So it takes a while to get through a volume.

586
00:40:43,513 --> 00:40:47,747
Rym: So, there you go, all right, so yeah join our discord hang out in the live streams.

587
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:48,810
Rym: There's people rocking in here.

588
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,167
Rym: There's actually a thriving conversation happening in parallel with the show.

589
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:55,055
Rym: right now We're gonna try to make some content.

590
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:59,350
Rym: I've done a little more work toward the next utenna analysis episode.

591
00:41:00,372 --> 00:41:12,233
Rym: I've started cutting out clips of episode 17 of utenna mmm, and We realized we've never talked about hair on GeekNights except once on December.

592
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:17,268
Scott: maybe we have and that video was deleted by the episode by somebody on December 15th.

593
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:22,038
Rym: We did an episode shows.

594
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:23,182
Scott: It's one of our earliest shows.

595
00:41:23,222 --> 00:41:23,463
Rym: Yep.

596
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:35,640
Rym: We did an episode on shaving because We had both decided to get real safety razors and stop using the mock threes to save money And we've saved a lot of money and had better shaves.

597
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:36,523
Rym: I had saved 20 or 15 years.

598
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:40,112
Rym: I had saved almost $4,000.

599
00:41:40,112 --> 00:41:52,260
Rym: cuz I was keeping track of like how much money I saved and after I hit like $4,000 and I just stopped counting and that was a long time ago Mmm, I changed my blade like once a week.

600
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,469
Rym: that blade costs like 2 cents.

601
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:59,400
Rym: So, uh, we're not gonna talk about shaving necessarily.

602
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:01,006
Scott: everything we said 15 years ago.

603
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:01,970
Scott: We were right.

604
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:04,483
Rym: Yeah safety razors are just so.

605
00:42:04,543 --> 00:42:05,910
Rym: they are superior in every body.

606
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:10,787
Scott: You are using any sort of like, you know, Mach 3 shik Gillette bullshit.

607
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:11,730
Scott: that cost a lot of money.

608
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:18,617
Scott: Go back and listen to that because you got to shave the old-fashioned way with the cheapo blade But not the oldest fashion ways.

609
00:42:18,798 --> 00:42:20,985
Scott: straight razors do get better razor.

610
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,310
Rym: So they do give a better shave.

611
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,570
Rym: I'm not gonna say they don't like they are but you'll cut yourself or you'll get good at it.

612
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:33,470
Rym: But it's a skill you have to learn and then you have introduced to your morning routine a real element of danger.

613
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:41,230
Scott: Yes, the point is safety razor Brush, you're gonna have a way better shaving experience and shaving life and save a shit ton of money.

614
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,372
Scott: It's better and cheaper.

615
00:42:42,412 --> 00:42:43,534
Scott: How often is that true?

616
00:42:43,554 --> 00:42:47,020
Rym: I almost bought a new puck of soap when I moved to New York City.

617
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,548
Rym: I replaced it last year.

618
00:42:52,439 --> 00:43:03,119
Scott: so I Recently like within the past month Opened the third Tub of shaving soap that I bought.

619
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:05,506
Rym: Oh, you still use the pre-whipped stuff, right?

620
00:43:05,827 --> 00:43:09,054
Scott: Yeah since 2005 I guess right.

621
00:43:09,856 --> 00:43:11,901
Scott: so five five years per tub.

622
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:12,241
Rym: Yep.

623
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:13,364
Rym: I went a little deeper.

624
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:15,569
Rym: I went to puck of just hard soap.

625
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:19,009
Rym: Nine years is about how long one of those will last.

626
00:43:21,113 --> 00:43:22,921
Rym: I didn't replace it because it was gone.

627
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:24,870
Rym: I replaced it because it got disgusting.

628
00:43:27,057 --> 00:43:34,210
Scott: I Started like holding it under To like reach it up the smells when you do it a little more frequently.

629
00:43:34,331 --> 00:43:38,330
Rym: Yeah, I did want to change up the smell too because it was the same smell for a decade.

630
00:43:38,671 --> 00:43:43,830
Rym: So right exactly, but now we're talking about pretty good all hair except shaving.

631
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:45,763
Rym: But I guess we'll talk about it face hair.

632
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:46,910
Scott: Hey, we're talking about head hair.

633
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:52,050
Scott: We're not talking about chest hair back hair pubes not talking about we need those future Thursday episodes.

634
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,158
Scott: That's right.

635
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,005
Scott: head hair only.

636
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:56,075
Rym: yep Cuz I used to.

637
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:57,219
Scott: I used to have head hair.

00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,026
Scott: believe it or not Scott did had a lot.

639
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:14,381
Rym: in fact funnily enough Today Scott found on a floppy disk a bunch of pictures of us in college in the year 2001 and Scott looks like 20 years younger and There weren't any pictures of me, but I was 20 years younger though.

640
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:16,870
Rym: Yeah, but I looked at a picture of myself.

641
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,556
Scott: I was 20 years.

642
00:44:18,597 --> 00:44:21,126
Scott: Yeah, I pretty much like two trains already gone.

Rym: fuck you.

648
00:44:25,547 --> 00:44:26,030
Scott: It's a good thing.

00:44:26,111 --> 00:44:27,543
Scott: I have one three train for company.

650
00:44:27,704 --> 00:44:31,700
Scott: Yeah We get a run more one more time though if the three train wait.

651
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,250
Rym: wait did the are the twos rusted?

652
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:35,901
Rym: Yeah, oh fuck.

00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,333
Scott: Yeah, good thing.

655
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:40,160
Rym: I'm you are is gonna have to merge.

656
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,103
Rym: We're playing a train game.

657
00:44:41,123 --> 00:44:44,252
Rym: We're playing 1817.

658
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:44,695
Rym: God damn it.

659
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,569
Rym: I was hoping I'd get to run one more - with my job.

660
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,950
Scott: I was hoping I get to run more time even though I don't need him all right.

661
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:56,608
Rym: Anyway, anyway, uh Over the years Scott got balder and balder, and I pretty much stayed the same.

662
00:44:57,029 --> 00:45:03,929
Rym: now I'm thinning because I'm old but still got long hair and we get we inverted and Scott is completely bald and I have long hair.

663
00:45:05,232 --> 00:45:11,567
Rym: and it's funny when I look at our YouTube videos because People a lot of people who watch our YouTube videos have no idea.

664
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:12,290
Rym: GeekNights exists.

665
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:22,710
Rym: Like there's a weird segment of like game design people who just find our videos and watch them and interact in YouTube But they always refer to us as long hair guy and bald guy.

666
00:45:24,092 --> 00:45:28,146
Rym: That seems accurate yep, and there was a comment that was posted two days ago.

667
00:45:28,527 --> 00:45:29,370
Rym: That was really funny.

668
00:45:29,996 --> 00:45:31,691
Rym: It was on an old old panel We did.

669
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:38,988
Rym: it was on one of those ones from like paxies 2010 and the comment was the bald guy is way too mean to the long haired guy.

670
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:49,755
Rym: Oh So uh long hair is kind of a pain in the ass Like.

671
00:45:49,776 --> 00:45:53,793
Scott: I've gathered that from the people that I'm aware of Like.

672
00:45:53,853 --> 00:45:58,567
Rym: I would never get rid of it unless I got too scully and was forced to like.

673
00:45:58,627 --> 00:46:06,710
Rym: I love having long hair But you will like roll over on your own hair in bed and wake yourself up from like yanking it.

674
00:46:07,174 --> 00:46:08,509
Rym: You will get hot and stuff.

675
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:12,710
Rym: It'll like stick to certain kinds of clothes like velcro.

676
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:17,143
Scott: Well, it's like you shampoo like when I shampooed and I had hair.

677
00:46:17,204 --> 00:46:18,790
Scott: I never had long hair, right?

678
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:23,335
Scott: I would shampoo had rubbed my head to lather it up But how do you shampoo the hair?

679
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,423
Scott: that's like way down far about the pro move.

680
00:46:25,443 --> 00:46:25,825
Rym: you don't.

681
00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:30,050
Rym: if you don't shampoo that shit It'll only shampoo to clean the scalp the hair just rinse out.

682
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:32,438
Rym: Okay, you only put a listener.

683
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,570
Scott: grab the hair in a bunch and try to like shim.

684
00:46:35,154 --> 00:46:37,350
Rym: That would just tangle it into an impossible nightmare.

685
00:46:37,811 --> 00:46:45,588
Rym: what I do is I shampoo it just the top with Celsius and blue because I got I'll get some dandruff otherwise and I only do that like once a week.

686
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:51,028
Rym: Otherwise, I just rinse it and then I put conditioner all the way in and I comb it all out and straighten it.

687
00:46:52,631 --> 00:46:54,861
Scott: So you don't condition the dangling parts either.

688
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:56,990
Rym: You know, I mostly condition the dangling parts.

689
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,539
Rym: I don't condition the parts by my scalp.

690
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,430
Scott: So you see you squirt some goop on your hand.

691
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:02,114
Scott: Yeah, how do you physically?

692
00:47:02,275 --> 00:47:06,170
Rym: so shampoo goes in my hand just on the scalp and then I rinse it all out.

693
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:07,895
Rym: Then I rinse the hair thoroughly.

694
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:12,690
Rym: then I put a bunch of conditioner in my hand and I only put it in the long part.

695
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:14,697
Scott: How do you how do you put it in?

696
00:47:14,758 --> 00:47:15,521
Scott: like you just sort of like.

697
00:47:15,562 --> 00:47:17,150
Rym: I just reach up and like hold the hair.

698
00:47:17,656 --> 00:47:30,004
Rym: I just kind of like it Finger comb it with this with it and then I take a comb in the shower and I comb it while the conditioners in there See you you sort of like use your fingers as a comb covered.

699
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:34,788
Scott: when your fingers are covered in condition Basically, yeah, and you comb through all the hair with your fingers till the all the.

700
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:36,224
Scott: you know The goop is on the hair.

701
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:45,380
Rym: basically Yeah, use a and use a real coat but when my hair was the longest it ever got when it was kind of past my ass It actually took a lot of conditioner and I have.

702
00:47:45,922 --> 00:47:52,705
Rym: I have kept my hair actually a lot shorter than I used to for many Years, I keep it like a couple feet like it goes past my shoulder blades.

703
00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:56,390
Rym: Of course now kovat It's actually getting real long because I'm not willing to go get a haircut.

704
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:04,066
Scott: Mmm Alright, so but when you go you have the long hair and you go to do go to get a haircut You got to pay more money, right?

705
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:06,850
Rym: Yep So I remember when I first started having long hair.

706
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,510
Rym: I went to my usual barber and they said they had to charge me the women's price.

707
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:14,023
Rym: They just charge more if you have long hair straight out.

708
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:14,625
Scott: It's more work.

709
00:48:14,886 --> 00:48:15,087
Rym: Yep.

710
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:15,750
Rym: It is more work.

711
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,445
Rym: There's a lot more stuff to do if you mess it up, right?

712
00:48:18,466 --> 00:48:27,219
Scott: You can't fix it Right, and it's got this weird sort of intermingling with like Sexism but also reality on the one hand.

713
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:35,909
Scott: It's like we've created this standard, you know for like, you know Women to have long hair but and then therefore hair cuts cost more but it's like.

714
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:36,894
Rym: but well There's also more.

715
00:48:36,954 --> 00:48:39,890
Rym: like a lot of times when people say a quote women's haircut.

716
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:44,938
Rym: They also mean styling which is expensive but also very difficult and time-consuming Right, but it's like.

717
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:50,901
Scott: it's also difficult times news like these, you know These, you know beauty standards and then all these things are getting in on there.

718
00:48:51,021 --> 00:48:56,938
Scott: What's cool though is the barbershop relating to actual You know Economics, right?

719
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,481
Scott: Yeah.

720
00:48:57,582 --> 00:48:58,890
Rym: Yeah, but some cool things.

721
00:49:00,114 --> 00:49:04,890
Rym: In New York City a lot of the barbershops I go to they don't gender it anymore.

722
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,876
Rym: They're not like Oh women's price men's price.

723
00:49:07,117 --> 00:49:08,923
Rym: They're like this kind of hair.

724
00:49:09,003 --> 00:49:10,387
Rym: is this price this kind of hair?

725
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,029
Rym: is this price?

726
00:49:11,872 --> 00:49:13,677
Scott: Right, but it's still the you know, the the.

727
00:49:13,797 --> 00:49:19,498
Scott: so, you know, despite how much progress you've made and how many people of you know Like you're a dude with long hair.

728
00:49:19,518 --> 00:49:25,600
Rym: Yeah, that was any that was actually Moderately controversial when I was in middle school in high school, right?

729
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,449
Scott: How many not dudes how many not dudes have short hair?

730
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:28,850
Scott: plenty?

731
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,350
Rym: In fact when I was in middle school some people up all the time.

732
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,569
Rym: I remember there were people who had a problem with the fact that I had a pierced ear as a man.

733
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:38,497
Rym: Sure, but wasn't that long ago, right?

734
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:41,705
Scott: The majority beauty standard is still right.

735
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:42,768
Scott: long hair on.

736
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:47,247
Scott: you know People who are women and the craft is or not.

737
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:52,610
Rym: There's a thing that I learned a while ago that really explained a lot of nonsense.

738
00:49:53,472 --> 00:50:08,230
Rym: there is a problem that men with long hair have that that women with long hair do not have when we talk about biology and it's specific to the hair on the bottom of the neck in a male body like a genetically male body.

739
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,743
Rym: Usually that hair isn't the same as head hair.

740
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:17,350
Rym: It's beard hair So it won't grow as long as your head hair.

741
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:20,417
Rym: It'll grow to a certain length and kind of.

742
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:24,663
Scott: is that also true if you are a Trans man and you retain testosterone?

743
00:50:24,683 --> 00:50:25,609
Scott: would that change that hair?

744
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:29,410
Scott: I know it depends on strong and hair are pretty linked or it is from what I've read.

745
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,799
Rym: It depends on when you transition.

746
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:43,310
Rym: There's a bunch of factors and it gets complicated Mm-hmm, but for me what that means is I have long hair and I can just tie it back except the hair on the bottom of My neck will only get as long as the maximum length of my beard and never longer.

747
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:45,650
Rym: So I can't tie it into a ponytail.

748
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:53,974
Rym: So there's this like frizz back there that I have to get styled and buzzed like regularly or my hair looks really messy Mm-hmm.

749
00:50:54,136 --> 00:50:55,210
Rym: It's a giant pain in the ass.

750
00:50:55,511 --> 00:51:01,976
Rym: I can't do it myself and if and if and even if like I asked Emily to do it if you mess that up and like Buzz too much into the long hair.

751
00:51:02,538 --> 00:51:03,502
Rym: That'll be a problem.

752
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:05,349
Rym: That'll take like six months to grow out.

753
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:07,415
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's the thing.

754
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:09,143
Scott: Is it on anyone's body?

755
00:51:09,504 --> 00:51:12,836
Scott: right when you start, you know Getting more hairs from puberty and whatnot?

756
00:51:13,158 --> 00:51:16,950
Scott: the different different kinds of hairs grow in different parts of your body.

757
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:20,590
Scott: It's and it's like, you know one, you know my arm hair.

758
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:30,830
Scott: It's like, you know, if I didn't absolutely nothing if I was like a caveman I wore no clothes and I applied no products and I did no grooming my arm hair would still be different hair from my head hair.

759
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:31,591
Scott: Yeah It's just

760
00:51:31,953 --> 00:51:46,848
Rym: or different people due to genetics have different kinds of hair and that's where you get into now racism and the fact that a lot of hair products and a lot of styling guides Are aimed at the default like straight or wavy white person hair and not all the other kinds of hair.

761
00:51:46,888 --> 00:51:50,719
Scott: people might have Mm-hmm or depending on the country you're in.

762
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,602
Scott: Yep.

763
00:51:51,662 --> 00:51:54,430
Rym: I'm talking from an American centric person, right?

764
00:51:54,510 --> 00:52:04,848
Scott: But I'm saying like let's say you go to China Right, if you don't have you know, the hair of a Chinese person and you're in China It's you're gonna maybe have a hard time finding, you know things that are gonna work for you.

765
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:07,300
Rym: Yeah I remember a couple years ago.

766
00:52:07,321 --> 00:52:09,090
Rym: I went to a barbershop that was aimed.

767
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,810
Rym: It was like a fancy barbershop that would do like straight razor shaves and stuff and I went to it in Midtown.

768
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:18,290
Rym: I was like I need a nice haircut cuz I'm gonna go to line the strip and they were like you have long hair.

769
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:19,918
Rym: We don't know how to cut it at all.

770
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:22,209
Rym: We specialize in these kinds of hair.

771
00:52:23,131 --> 00:52:27,590
Rym: I will fuck it up and they actually gave me a referral to a different place that could cut my hair.

772
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,885
Scott: Mmm, I mean it's the same if you bring your car to a place.

773
00:52:31,925 --> 00:52:32,650
Scott: They can't work on it.

774
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,209
Scott: But yeah, so let's I guess I'll talk about having no hair.

775
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:44,370
Scott: My whole life I had hair but I almost always, you know had some sort of short haircut of some kind, right?

776
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:54,353
Scott: Sometimes I would go shorter than other times Sometimes I'd like part it over sometimes I'd like make it go backwards, you know, whatever I didn't you know Do too much of it.

777
00:52:54,834 --> 00:53:01,823
Scott: Mostly I just had hair because I had it and I would wash it.

778
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,858
Scott: and You know, I didn't want to.

779
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:13,489
Scott: you know, they do too much work or maintenance on it was a pain in the ass Yeah, and then I was like that until I decided to grow my hair out and then I had to do stuff to it.

780
00:53:14,272 --> 00:53:24,699
Scott: Yeah, and you know some of my relatives like, you know, my dad and his dad and his brother That whole side the Reuben part of the family They all didn't have a lot of hair left.

781
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:28,455
Scott: and the other side of the family mother's side of the family They all had a lot of hair.

782
00:53:28,595 --> 00:53:29,459
Scott: They still had hair.

783
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,223
Scott: They didn't lose it.

784
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:31,167
Rym: So maybe you had a 50/50 shot.

785
00:53:32,635 --> 00:53:34,447
Scott: Who knows how it's gonna be right?

786
00:53:34,487 --> 00:53:36,412
Scott: Whatever You know.

787
00:53:36,452 --> 00:53:42,490
Scott: and then over time it's like, you know, did I have like some bald spot or some widow's peak?

788
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:49,210
Scott: not really, but what's sort of happening was sort of like an Einstein sort of effect where just I had hair.

789
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:53,610
Scott: I still do actually have hair from front on every single part of my head there.

790
00:53:53,811 --> 00:53:56,430
Scott: It is not like some spot where there's like no hair growing.

791
00:53:56,992 --> 00:54:04,096
Scott: It's just the density of hairs is way less in anywhere on top from the front, you know It's like at the front of my head.

792
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,162
Scott: There's still hairs middle.

793
00:54:05,262 --> 00:54:06,670
Scott: I can still feel some hairs back.

794
00:54:06,772 --> 00:54:13,773
Scott: I still feel some hairs Right, but it's pretty much only on the sides of my head and the back of my head that there is still the same Density of hairs.

795
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:18,470
Scott: there has been my whole life at least since I had hair, you know babies don't have hair not too much.

796
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:24,870
Scott: Anyway, I was born with a pretty substantial head of hair actually Yeah, but the top of my head there are way less hairs.

797
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:29,010
Scott: So even if I were to let them grow now, like there wouldn't be a bald spot.

798
00:54:29,151 --> 00:54:29,854
Scott: It would just be.

799
00:54:29,874 --> 00:54:33,570
Scott: you'd be like able to see through the hairs on the top of my head.

800
00:54:33,651 --> 00:54:34,862
Scott: Yeah to the wall behind me.

801
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:35,710
Rym: you got to that moment.

802
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:49,202
Rym: Yeah I think a lot of men Will get to this point where from the front like when you're looking at yourself in the mirror It looks fine, but from other angles those thin areas appear Yeah, so I'm getting that a little bit from actually from.

803
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:56,310
Rym: because I've tied my hair back so tightly for so long I've actually fucked up a bunch of the hair follicles in the back of my head near the top.

804
00:54:56,953 --> 00:55:01,391
Rym: But once I corrected that I haven't thinned further Hmm.

805
00:55:02,234 --> 00:55:05,406
Scott: But yeah, so, you know over time in my life, I did different hair.

806
00:55:05,527 --> 00:55:06,330
Scott: I went to barbers.

807
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:13,790
Scott: Sometimes I went to like, you know fans slightly fancier not actually fancy places, right but slightly not barber places.

808
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:15,034
Scott: You know places that would you know.

809
00:55:15,074 --> 00:55:21,557
Scott: shampoo and stuff, you know, not just cut your hair and send you on your way for 10 bucks You know, I mixed it up.

810
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:22,541
Scott: I've had different places.

811
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:24,390
Scott: sometimes I stuck with the place for a long time.

812
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,965
Scott: Sometimes I you know went to own a place only a couple times whatever.

813
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:28,949
Scott: whatever is convenient, right?

814
00:55:29,873 --> 00:55:36,985
Scott: And then when I started seeing that, you know When the the trend you the the thinning on the top was becoming sort of like too much.

815
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:42,266
Scott: It's like, alright, you know bad enough of this Right, and I said, you know what?

816
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:47,790
Scott: I'm gonna shave my head but I don't want to do what a lot of people do which is use the razor on their head.

817
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,680
Scott: Cuz I was worried about a cut in my head.

818
00:55:50,203 --> 00:55:51,509
Scott: Yeah B. That's a lot of work.

819
00:55:51,992 --> 00:55:54,750
Scott: See I got like take a razor all the way in the back of my head.

820
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,644
Scott: It's like I didn't want to go to that territory, right?

821
00:55:58,107 --> 00:55:58,750
Scott: I said, you know what?

822
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:04,510
Scott: I'll just get the Clippers that the barber has the same ones Oster 76, you know the big burn, right?

823
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,076
Scott: I can just buy that same thing.

824
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:07,402
Scott: The barber has right.

825
00:56:07,442 --> 00:56:08,166
Scott: I go on Amazon.

826
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:12,642
Scott: It's not that expensive It's a hundred something bucks right the cost of what like five or six haircuts.

827
00:56:12,923 --> 00:56:15,170
Scott: Yeah, you know, I'm gonna and it's gonna last me forever.

828
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:20,010
Scott: and You know, you can get all the guards for it and different blades for it.

829
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,502
Scott: You can you know, you got a grease it.

830
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:22,510
Scott: you got to take care of it.

831
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,090
Scott: So it lasts a long time, but you can replace the blades.

832
00:56:25,231 --> 00:56:28,750
Scott: It's pretty much just a motor with a power cable coming out of it, right?

833
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:32,200
Scott: So I bought one and it's real easy.

834
00:56:32,301 --> 00:56:34,490
Scott: It's you can mow a lawn you can buzz your head.

835
00:56:35,212 --> 00:56:38,095
Scott: You're not trying to make any particular style You're just trying to get rid all your hair.

836
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:43,737
Scott: and what I did the first time is I put on a thicker guard Right and I went down.

837
00:56:43,757 --> 00:56:45,764
Scott: I think I put like number one and I moved.

838
00:56:45,784 --> 00:56:48,356
Scott: all my hair is number one and I said How does that look?

839
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:49,786
Scott: that looks kind of stupid?

840
00:56:49,827 --> 00:56:50,189
Scott: Let me go.

841
00:56:51,554 --> 00:56:57,173
Scott: and I basically just kept decreasing the you know, the the amount of hair and What I've.

842
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:05,289
Scott: just what I've landed on after you know Not too long is that at first I ended up just using the triple zero blade itself, right?

843
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:05,730
Scott: Just direct.

844
00:57:06,976 --> 00:57:14,670
Scott: but then I Realized there was a five zero blade and I said is that five zero blade really?

845
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,996
Scott: Like is that just like a gimmick?

846
00:57:17,056 --> 00:57:20,770
Scott: how much closer and shorter can the hair be than the triple zero blade, right?

847
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:28,870
Scott: It's like I'm already down And it's like no the five zero blade actually is really nice and even shorter than the three zero blade.

848
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:33,044
Scott: So all I do is I go in the somewhere that I don't I can't.

849
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:36,758
Scott: I can safely make a mess of hair Like the shower or a balcony or whatever.

850
00:57:36,778 --> 00:57:39,730
Scott: I take the five zero blade and it's come here.

851
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:43,236
Scott: I just mow my whole head like it's a lawn Even behind.

852
00:57:43,316 --> 00:57:51,221
Scott: I just use two mirrors get behind there, you know to verify this whole head at the five zero, but Then there's some issues.

853
00:57:51,281 --> 00:58:00,150
Scott: right the issues are no Mostly right behind your ear right the bottom of the back of the neck where rims, you know beard tangly hairs are right.

854
00:58:00,613 --> 00:58:03,330
Scott: You know this right in the very front of the head.

855
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:09,770
Scott: It's actually here and also this sort of front side not sideburn but like in front temple area, right?

856
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,570
Scott: So I have this thing called the T trimmer, right?

857
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:14,613
Scott: Which is what the.

858
00:58:14,733 --> 00:58:18,650
Scott: it's like that tiny clipper the barber uses right to sort of clean up the edges, right?

859
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:20,516
Scott: And so I got one of those.

860
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:20,898
Scott: it doesn't.

861
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:23,310
Scott: you can't interchange the but you can replace the blade if it breaks.

862
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,670
Scott: But you can't interchange the blade.

863
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:28,330
Scott: It's just the T trimmer blade and I use that to clean up the edges, right?

864
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:34,310
Scott: And then I shave or don't shave my face based on whether I'm beard and lately I'm not bearded.

865
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:35,357
Scott: I'm trying to take care of.

866
00:58:35,377 --> 00:58:42,469
Rym: skin is in terms of face hair I like both of us can grow a really good beard and I can't just alternate between beard and no beard randomly.

867
00:58:42,509 --> 00:58:43,794
Rym: right now I'm bearding cuz.

868
00:58:43,874 --> 00:58:44,938
Rym: I've been too lazy to shave.

869
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,744
Scott: I've been not bearding cuz.

870
00:58:46,764 --> 00:58:48,250
Scott: I'm trying to take care of my face skins.

871
00:58:48,932 --> 00:58:59,390
Rym: Ah, yeah, you've always had a little more like face hair skin troubles that I have My my hair skin troubles are more like I'll get tinea versicolor on my chest, but we're not talking about chest hair today.

872
00:58:59,732 --> 00:59:03,590
Scott: I get that in the back on the back of and I'll get a thick dandruff.

873
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:07,270
Rym: I'm not careful with the Celsius and blue but only on the head and the sideburns.

874
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:12,674
Rym: Mmm, what I've been doing though is I also have the fancy clippers But I've been using them to.

875
00:59:12,794 --> 00:59:27,624
Rym: I've been fading my sideburns myself because as much as I appreciate good mutton shops My mutton shops do not work or look good unless I grow them like with a full-on beard Like if I let them just be proper mutton jobs, they just look scraggly and weird.

876
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:29,370
Rym: So I really got to like fade them regularly.

877
00:59:30,451 --> 00:59:31,336
Rym: Actually, they're kind of do.

878
00:59:31,417 --> 00:59:33,227
Rym: they're sticking out past the headphones right now.

879
00:59:34,272 --> 00:59:48,670
Scott: Yeah, so the final thing I do is after you know, even if I'm not I Even if I have a whether I have a beard or not, right You know, you sort of still want to even out the sideburns somewhat maybe right?

880
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:53,090
Scott: So I actually do use the real razor on the sideburn.

881
00:59:53,191 --> 00:59:54,929
Rym: I knew that all the sideburns.

882
00:59:54,990 --> 01:00:01,229
Rym: but I use the buzzer with the like the fade controls to go up and make sure that they're like a nice even look.

883
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:05,270
Scott: and Sometimes the tea trimmer doesn't do a great job behind the ear.

884
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:11,854
Scott: So I'll maybe I'll even take the razor behind the ear a little bit right to try to you know, get that action And then that's it.

885
01:00:11,995 --> 01:00:14,849
Scott: And then it's like it looks like I look like a bald person.

886
01:00:15,851 --> 01:00:19,809
Scott: And my alternative is to look like Einstein right or just hair coming out the sides only.

887
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:22,397
Scott: Maybe I'll do that when I'm an old man.

888
01:00:22,438 --> 01:00:24,387
Scott: It'll be fun for a Halloween customer.

889
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:27,236
Scott: So, I don't know You could definitely pull off a full-on Aramaki.

890
01:00:27,296 --> 01:00:28,279
Rym: I still say you should do it.

891
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,425
Scott: Yeah, exactly Aramaki same Einstein hair.

892
01:00:30,445 --> 01:00:30,505
Scott: Yep.

893
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:30,605
Scott: Dr.

894
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,572
Scott: Wylie Dr.

895
01:00:33,612 --> 01:00:34,456
Scott: Wylie same haircut.

896
01:00:34,476 --> 01:00:38,030
Rym: Yeah, you know what when we're old you will be great at cosplays.

897
01:00:39,213 --> 01:00:42,500
Scott: Those three costs those three cosplays Einstein, dr.

898
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,721
Scott: Wylie and Arma Or all Saitama.

899
01:00:46,842 --> 01:00:47,688
Scott: Those are my four cosplay.

900
01:00:50,372 --> 01:00:50,994
Scott: But yeah, no.

901
01:00:51,034 --> 01:00:55,696
Scott: so that the main thing though is like when you don't have hair at all Right, you're at least.

902
01:00:55,716 --> 01:01:03,689
Scott: when you have this few little hair on your head You enter a whole new world of benefits and consequences not all of which were obvious at the beginning.

903
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:18,209
Scott: so Benefit number one don't got to spend money at the barber, you know much money I've saved not time at the razor money anymore, right every time I went to the barber I was spending even if it was a cheap barber 15 bucks plus tip 20 bucks plus something like that cheap cheap barber.

904
01:01:18,851 --> 01:01:19,613
Scott: Now I'm paying zero.

905
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:25,518
Scott: I bought the Clippers once the end I Don't have to buy anything else.

906
01:01:25,538 --> 01:01:28,214
Scott: I mean I bought all this stuff like Lubricants and whatever.

907
01:01:28,234 --> 01:01:32,050
Scott: I have a spray can of like this spray cool, whatever.

908
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,485
Scott: No, it's like you spray it on the clipper before you use it, you know barber does that too?

909
01:01:36,188 --> 01:01:36,550
Scott: that one?

910
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:37,515
Scott: Can is not empty.

911
01:01:37,816 --> 01:01:39,062
Scott: I've had it for how many years.

912
01:01:39,082 --> 01:01:40,590
Scott: I don't even know how many it's still going.

913
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:44,140
Scott: I have a tube of like blade oil in a bottle.

914
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,325
Scott: It's a bottle of blade oil.

915
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:46,450
Scott: It's never run out.

916
01:01:46,571 --> 01:01:47,768
Scott: It's still very very full.

917
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:49,495
Scott: You know, it's like it's.

918
01:01:49,555 --> 01:01:51,625
Scott: I don't think it's gonna run out maybe ever.

919
01:01:51,645 --> 01:01:52,590
Scott: who knows?

920
01:01:54,417 --> 01:02:01,869
Scott: You know just stuff like that, right The worst thing that's happened is one times I dropped the clipper and I broke the blade and had to buy a new one For 20 bucks.

921
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:06,847
Scott: So with the cost of a single haircut if I happen to drop the Clippers and break the blade.

922
01:02:06,907 --> 01:02:13,472
Rym: a major con I've noticed for you though is You get cold way easy.

923
01:02:13,854 --> 01:02:21,189
Scott: the two major cons of having no hair, so Having no hair Temperature wise is a pro and a con.

924
01:02:21,631 --> 01:02:26,624
Scott: The pro is like biking in the summer and a cool breeze comes through and there's.

925
01:02:26,765 --> 01:02:27,146
Scott: it doesn't.

926
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:29,223
Scott: it's not even cool breeze through your hair it's just.

927
01:02:31,031 --> 01:02:35,610
Scott: That's a lot of the reason how come I can stand the heat and bike when it's like 90 degrees out.

928
01:02:35,931 --> 01:02:41,009
Rym: I gotta like tie my hair up into a bun to keep it like off the back of my neck while I'm biking in the heat.

929
01:02:42,085 --> 01:02:44,899
Scott: Yep Yeah, that's but of course.

930
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:47,390
Scott: Yeah, I'm very very cold all the time.

931
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,215
Scott: I gotta like bundle up in the winter.

932
01:02:49,335 --> 01:02:52,623
Scott: blankets coats hats hats are huge.

933
01:02:52,724 --> 01:02:55,210
Scott: Very important to have the hats going on, right?

934
01:02:56,350 --> 01:03:00,529
Scott: But the other con besides being way cold is sunburn on the head.

935
01:03:02,931 --> 01:03:15,410
Scott: Despite you know learning having learned that lesson more than once I Listen is bike helmet does not stop all Sun from getting through.

936
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:16,915
Scott: It does not.

937
01:03:17,437 --> 01:03:20,850
Rym: even I cuz I've got that thin spot in the back where my ponytail pulls down.

938
01:03:21,312 --> 01:03:24,250
Rym: I've gotten a sunburn there from my bike helmet.

939
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:29,348
Rym: There was like this two squares of sunburn under the hair because of those holes in the bike helmet.

940
01:03:30,234 --> 01:03:31,970
Scott: Yeah, so the benefits are you know?

941
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:37,929
Scott: The money saving the cold when you want to be cold because cold when you don't want to be cold is a con, right?

942
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:42,969
Scott: In lack of maintenance you don't have to like do any hair shit.

943
01:03:44,532 --> 01:03:45,840
Scott: You know like you don't like.

944
01:03:46,383 --> 01:03:54,849
Scott: if I mean I do Put some like Celsius and blue on the sides mostly But it's mostly to keep fungus off my back more than it is to not a dandruff or anything on my head.

945
01:03:56,651 --> 01:04:00,424
Scott: I do have an oily scalp, which isn't really a problem actually.

946
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:01,970
Scott: It's not like actually a bad thing.

947
01:04:02,915 --> 01:04:05,189
Scott: In fact oil just protects your skin.

948
01:04:05,411 --> 01:04:10,029
Scott: It's kind of good, but it can also be kind of gross just a bunch of sebum all over the place.

949
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:26,330
Scott: So if you want to you can like you know use like skin facial skincare products on your head like moisturizers Cleansers to sort of you know because your scalp is now skin and not hair rather than shampooing skin, which is kind of right.

950
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:31,630
Scott: But you still the side of your head, I guess even though I you know it still has hair there right.

951
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:32,743
Scott: So I wouldn't do it on the side.

952
01:04:34,774 --> 01:04:36,250
Scott: So I guess that's kind of a con.

953
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:38,417
Scott: But yeah, it's just like you know.

954
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,170
Scott: life becomes comfortable and easy in a lot of ways.

955
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:44,124
Scott: You don't got to worry about hair, but no bad hair days.

956
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:45,330
Scott: No hair getting caught and stuff.

957
01:04:45,391 --> 01:04:49,040
Scott: No one can pull on your hair in a fight I always thought about like.

958
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,870
Rym: I wouldn't mind trying a bunch of short hair styles.

959
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:54,493
Rym: The only reason I don't is that if I want to go back It's not.

960
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:56,370
Rym: I can go from long to short really fast.

961
01:04:56,852 --> 01:04:59,121
Rym: I can't go from short to long really easily.

962
01:04:59,182 --> 01:05:01,090
Rym: and the worst part is if you've never grown your hair out.

963
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:07,350
Rym: There's a period where it starts to get long and it looks extra stupid and it's a giant pain in the ass.

964
01:05:07,712 --> 01:05:10,128
Rym: But it's not long enough to tie back reliably.

965
01:05:10,148 --> 01:05:22,479
Rym: yet You have to go through this really long awkward period before it's long enough again Especially in light of the beard hair nonsense in the back when you're first trying to tie it back.

966
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:39,797
Scott: Yeah, so I would recommend to people you know if you just you know If you have hair Right that's growing well Then you should do what you feel like doing with it and then act accordingly right?

967
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:40,720
Scott: How do you want to look?

968
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:41,940
Scott: What is your personal image?

969
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:47,077
Scott: Whatever that is make your hair be that way and do what you got to do to make it be that way.

970
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:48,621
Scott: high maintenance low Maintenance.

971
01:05:48,762 --> 01:05:58,050
Scott: you know whatever right, but the way you want to look doesn't doesn't match up with your money and your Maintenance effort you're willing to put in.

972
01:05:58,512 --> 01:06:10,359
Rym: then you're gonna have to make some tough choices but also learn the deal with your personal hair and You might find that your hair is a way to where the thing you're trying to do is not feasible or damages your hair.

973
01:06:11,442 --> 01:06:15,115
Rym: Mm-hmm like it's very much easier to lean into what your hair wants to do.

974
01:06:15,136 --> 01:06:19,920
Rym: is my advice Exactly if you're willing to go for it like go nuts.

975
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:30,379
Rym: I know people who do like crazy radical hair like really strong dye jobs and weird nonsense and like that's awesome But like a mohawk is a gigantic pain in the ass.

976
01:06:31,482 --> 01:06:32,789
Scott: Yep, like people.

977
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,560
Scott: I know that have had like mohawks.

978
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:40,478
Scott: It's like they only make it straight stand-up kick-ass punk rock on the special occasions.

979
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:46,020
Scott: most of the time It just they're just shaving the sides of their head and not the middle and it just sort of flops to the side.

980
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:46,923
Scott: It's just hair.

981
01:06:47,305 --> 01:06:55,898
Scott: Yeah, and that they only put on all the mohawk effort when it's you know Time to go out for a reason to be awesome Convention, you know, whatever.

982
01:06:57,301 --> 01:07:11,172
Scott: But yeah, if you have hair that is trying to run away from you and you're running out of hair You could if you wanted to try those, you know, don't be ashamed to try, you know, one of those Rogain's Propecia Yeah, whatever that's true.

983
01:07:11,212 --> 01:07:11,596
Scott: That's cool.

984
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:15,068
Scott: They have side effects, but they will work.

985
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:18,420
Scott: they they legitimately work for some people to some degree.

986
01:07:20,122 --> 01:07:22,833
Scott: I was just the main reason I never even bothered to try.

987
01:07:22,853 --> 01:07:24,500
Scott: I was like that one cost money.

988
01:07:25,721 --> 01:07:28,334
Scott: Yeah, I was like how long am I gonna be buying that for?

989
01:07:28,434 --> 01:07:29,560
Scott: and it's also more maintenance.

990
01:07:30,061 --> 01:07:30,944
Scott: Right where I was going.

991
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,689
Scott: the less money less maintenance, right?

992
01:07:32,709 --> 01:07:33,150
Rym: Oh, you know what?

993
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,193
Rym: I actually just looked up.

994
01:07:34,273 --> 01:07:39,050
Rym: apparently Rogain works on traction Alopecia, which is what I got going from my ponytail.

995
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:40,656
Scott: No, I did not know that.

996
01:07:40,676 --> 01:07:42,422
Scott: try it See what happens.

997
01:07:42,543 --> 01:07:48,520
Rym: It doesn't have the same side effects because male pattern baldness is caused by like baldness is a whole field.

998
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,764
Rym: There's like a lot of different causes.

999
01:07:49,824 --> 01:07:51,129
Rym: testosterone is tied to it.

1000
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:53,196
Rym: Tying it back is tied to it hair.

1001
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,360
Rym: Trauma is tied to it.

1002
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,884
Rym: There's all complicated.

1003
01:07:56,044 --> 01:07:56,285
Rym: Yep.

1004
01:07:56,787 --> 01:08:00,817
Rym: They're they're wearing hats too tight over long periods of time can cause certain kinds of baldness.

1005
01:08:01,499 --> 01:08:08,948
Scott: Yep If you want to dye your hair either because you just want to have awesome colors or because your hair is going gray Go for it.

1006
01:08:09,008 --> 01:08:13,128
Scott: Just keep in mind that money Maintenance effort thing going up.

1007
01:08:13,268 --> 01:08:21,337
Rym: or if you have very dark hair and you want to dye it strong colors You're gonna have to lighten it first, which will damage it and make it more fragile and then you run into situations.

1008
01:08:22,118 --> 01:08:27,880
Scott: Yep But if you are running out of hair and you don't want to try to bring it back, right?

1009
01:08:28,801 --> 01:08:34,220
Scott: I highly suggest don't try to do some, you know, just go for it, right?

1010
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,548
Scott: It's like yeah, just shave it all off.

1011
01:08:36,648 --> 01:08:39,738
Scott: It was so easy and life has been easy since then.

1012
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:45,380
Scott: In fact, the biggest hassle now is like, you know, it's like oh my hair is getting a little long.

1013
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:47,566
Scott: I don't really want it's like.

1014
01:08:47,645 --> 01:08:50,859
Scott: it takes like, you know 20 minutes or so to shave my head.

1015
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,344
Scott: It's like I don't.

1016
01:08:51,404 --> 01:08:51,667
Scott: it's like.

1017
01:08:52,152 --> 01:08:52,959
Scott: do I want to do that?

1018
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,772
Scott: It's almost like a chore like cleaning the dishes like I don't want to.

1019
01:08:56,435 --> 01:08:57,560
Rym: oh, I'll just googling.

1020
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:03,800
Rym: I found some medical sites that say Rogaine works for traction alopecia and other sites that say it does not work for traction alopecia.

1021
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,173
Scott: So yeah, I think you just got a. it's all it's over-the-counter.

1022
01:09:07,233 --> 01:09:13,658
Rym: So by I remember when it's And every ad on TV was Rogaine with Minoxidil.

1023
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,359
Scott: It's like just try it and see, you know, I'm not gonna I can't speak, you know to any experience with it.

1024
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:21,727
Rym: It's just like I will say I know.

1026
01:09:25,902 --> 01:09:32,238

01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:46,219
Rym: the difference is things like Rogaine act on the scalp because a lot of people who have male pattern baldness that it's testosterone scalp interactions that cause the baldness meaning the treatments mess with your hormones.

1028
01:09:47,981 --> 01:09:51,639

1032
01:10:06,512 --> 01:10:07,315

1033
01:10:07,335 --> 01:10:08,299
Scott: why couldn't it have been a?

1034
01:10:09,221 --> 01:10:10,726
Scott: Why are human bodies made that way?

1035
01:10:10,786 --> 01:10:15,080
