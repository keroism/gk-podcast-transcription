1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,408
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 11th, 2014.

2
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:17,319
Rym: Tonight, on Remembrance Day, we talk about Smash Brothers on the 3DS.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,438
Scott: We didn't say that we are Rym and Scott.

4
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:20,239
Rym: I'm Rym.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:20,678
Rym: I'm Scott.

6
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:21,920
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,398
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:27,300
Rym: It's been a while.

9
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:29,039
Rym: We just did one last week.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,873
Rym: We did, but that was a special, and so I was kinda sick.

11
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:34,319
Rym: Like, I was like, "Oh, I'm not feeling so

12
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:34,640
Rym: great.".

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,160
Rym: You know, after Australia, like, I felt like I was getting a cold.

14
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:47,759
Rym: And based on Emily's reaction to the cold, which was basically slight cold, and my reaction, which was, an hour after you left, I had a crazy fever and I passed out.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,287
Scott: Okay.

16
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:51,679
Rym: Yeah, my immune system was not too happy, so I don't remember.

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,260
Scott: I took a sick day yesterday, but I wasn't sick at all, but my apartment was sick.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,709
Scott: And now it is kinda clean.

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,893
Scott: I'm cleaning it up.

20
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:00,700
Scott: Get my life back in order.

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,719
Rym: You know, a lot of my coworkers and bosses actually listen to this show, so I couldn't get away with saying something like that.

22
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:06,894
Rym: Maybe I could.

23
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:07,238
Rym: I don't know.

24
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:07,965
Scott: Oh, no.

25
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,220
Scott: I'm so afraid.

26
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,800
Rym: I haven't taken a fake sick day, though, in the new company.

27
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:13,180
Rym: Now, the old company.

28
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:16,180
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, we're back.

29
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,560
Rym: We're regular schedule until, I guess, Pac South.

30
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:20,180
Scott: Thanksgiving.

31
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:21,126
Rym: Yeah.

32
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:22,139
Rym: I don't know.

33
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:23,580
Rym: I'm not going anywhere Thanksgiving.

34
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,160
Scott: I mean, there's still probably gonna be some missed podcasts around Thanksgiving, around holiday season.

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,619
Rym: I think New Year's is when we're actually gonna miss a show or two.

36
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,280
Scott: On days when weather keeps us home.

37
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,659
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but I'm gonna start stepping up.

38
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:37,638
Rym: So, what we'll talk about in a moment.

39
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,280
Rym: So, a lot of gaming news.

40
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,420
Rym: I mean, there was cheating in that ticket to ride tournament.

41
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,758
Scott: Oh, you wanna talk about that?

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,959
Rym: I don't really wanna talk about it.

43
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:49,260
Rym: That's an example of, there's like a hundred things we could talk about.

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,218
Rym: Try not to blow the load.

45
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,580
Scott: Well, I mean, gaming news is not something we have a shortage of.

46
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:56,861
Scott: True.

47
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:59,539
Rym: I feel like we should do a show on the cheating thing.

48
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,759
Scott: We've done cheating shows before, though.

49
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,059
Rym: I wanna do a tabletop specific cheating show.

50
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,100
Scott: Learn to be, learn sleight of hand skills by going to take classes in Magic and then use them.

51
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:14,340
Rym: So, here's an example.

52
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,279
Rym: I've noticed something.

53
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,979
Rym: When people cheat at Counter-Strike, like it happens.

54
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,456
Rym: The reaction is usually, "Oh my

55
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:20,840
Rym: God!"

56
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,240
Rym: And it's kind of funny for a while and then either the guy stops cheating or everyone just quits.

57
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Rym: It's like, it's no big deal.

58
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,900
Rym: Like, only a few people will like really flip out.

59
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,020
Scott: Well, people will flip out if it was like Counter-Strike Championship.

60
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:32,239
Rym: Well, if it's Counter-Strike Championship, no one flips out.

61
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,599
Scott: This was the final game.

62
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,817
Rym: Yeah, and you know what the answer is?

63
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:34,898
Rym: Wow.

64
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,459
Scott: Tickets to ride World Championships.

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,993
Rym: Yeah, but the reaction to that would be, "Wow, you just forfeited.

66
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:39,376
Rym: Awesome.".

67
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,140
Scott: But, the game- Not even if it gets caught way after the game's over.

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,700
Rym: But the difference is that the game enforces the rules.

69
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:54,839
Rym: So, to cheat at Counter-Strike in a tournament, you either need to like have someone physically ghosting the other team and talking to you with like a secret spy shit.

70
00:02:56,094 --> 00:03:01,420
Scott: Or- And usually you're playing in like soundproof things with the headphones and the- You need to like hack the computer.

71
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:07,597
Scott: Like, that is- Usually the competitive things that you're using computers provided by them- And not provided by you.

72
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,380
Rym: So, that's my point.

73
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:18,500
Rym: That's like, if you cheat in like a competitive Counter-Strike like national thing, that is some James Bond like- That's first degree murder, effectively.

74
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,940
Scott: It's like, they'll let you bring your mouse and keyboard usually, which would be really hard to cheat.

75
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,978
Rym: I hacked firmware on the mouse that as soon as I plugged it in- Yeah, they don't really care about that.

76
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,620
Rym: No, so the hacked firmware on the mouse actually hacks the computer and installs my aimbot.

77
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:32,219
Scott: They would notice.

78
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:40,660
Rym: But I'm saying, that's like first degree- You don't have root privileges on the computer, so- But cheating at a tabletop game is so different because there's nothing to enforce the rules.

79
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:53,419
Rym: Like literally, German board games, if you want to cheat, no one would ever catch you except maybe in a tournament when people are like, who aren't in the game are really watching you.

80
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:02,854
Rym: But, and also like I've noticed a lot of people like playing tabletop games, if they're not good at games, they fuck up rules and don't notice and effectively cheat it, but like don't realize it.

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,738
Rym: And people, if they mess up a rule with good players, like immediately, everyone at the table is like, hey, hey, hey, what did you just do there?

82
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,519
Rym: What just happened there?

83
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,012
Scott: If they're paying attention, right?

84
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:24,100
Rym: Things can happen- Yeah, competitive- I can't imagine someone like you or me, or anyone we know who's good at tabletop games, if they were playing for serious, not paying attention.

85
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Scott: Well, funny you should speak of that.

86
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,600
Scott: So the Netrunner World Championships was this weekend.

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,960
Scott: Congratulations to Dan, who is also the Philadelphia regional champion.

88
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,583
Rym: What?

89
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:36,240
Rym: Wait, Philly?

90
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,839
Scott: Yeah, so he was the Philadelphia regional champion, which I went to.

91
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,960
Rym: Philly's a, you know, I'm going to say something that I might regret.

92
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:44,200
Scott: He's now the world champion.

93
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,999
Rym: Philly actually does count as a city.

94
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:49,147
Scott: What?

95
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:50,360
Scott: Who said anything about that?

96
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,900
Rym: Philly's a city, get some respect.

97
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,940
Scott: I was just using the geography to identify the person.

98
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:55,727
Scott: Philly sucks ass.

99
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:57,060
Scott: Fuck you, Philly.

100
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,420
Scott: I mean, Dan's an okay person, I guess, for someone from Philly.

101
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:10,138
Rym: I guess in the list of places that you could live in as a city, Philly is actually higher up on the list than Boston in recent analysis.

102
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,500
Scott: But anyway, there was an incident during the tournament, which is relevant.

103
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:15,180
Scott: So there's an agenda.

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,904
Scott: I don't know, I guess you had to understand Netrunner rules a bit for me to explain this, but basically, a player- Sure, okay, fine.

105
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,129
Scott: So he had an N.A.P.D.

106
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:31,240
Scott: contract on the table, which is a four advance for two point card.

107
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,779
Scott: And he's at five points, so if he scores it, he wins.

108
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:45,140
Scott: He could score it in one turn by advancing it three times, with his three actions and three credits, and then using his astro script token, which costs no actions, to advance it a fourth time and score it.

109
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,559
Rym: So he's got that hanging out, just ready to go.

110
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,492
Scott: However, there is text on N.A.P.D.

111
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:54,838
Scott: contract that says, "If you have bad publicity, the advancement requirement goes up by

112
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,180
Scott: one.".

113
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:56,938
Rym: Oh, and he had bad publicity.

114
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Scott: He had bad publicity, so the advancement requirement was actually five.

115
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,600
Scott: This piece of text on the card is mostly forgotten by pretty much everybody.

116
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:10,495
Scott: A lot of people don't even know it, and when you tell it to them, they're like,

117
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:10,597
Scott: "What?".

118
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,539
Scott: Because it basically never comes up.

119
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:22,811
Scott: See, the thing is, this text on the card, and there's two sentences, and the first sentence says, "If the runner wants to steal the N.A.P.D.

120
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:23,816
Scott: contract, they have to pay four

121
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:24,238
Scott: credits.".

122
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,880
Scott: That happens all the goddamn time, and that's like the primary feature of the card.

123
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:38,154
Scott: So the fact that there's a secondary feature that almost never comes up, people don't even bother to read the card, and people don't know about that second penalty on the thing.

124
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,420
Scott: So there was an incident where we're watching on the stream.

125
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,360
Scott: No one can hear what the players are saying.

126
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,059
Scott: The people sitting next to the players are paying attention to their own games.

127
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,180
Scott: It wasn't a judged game in the super finals that was being watched very closely.

128
00:06:56,942 --> 00:07:00,120
Scott: So the guy, we're not sure exactly what happened.

129
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:12,660
Scott: Some people say, "Oh, yeah, he was showing that he couldn't advance it four times and win, and he could have won anyway with the three scorches in hand, and the other guy was tagged, so he had two win conditions and the same turn.

130
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,348
Scott: He was just showing

131
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:13,470
Scott: them.".

132
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:16,816
Scott: So the guy basically won the game legitimately.

133
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,560
Scott: It didn't really matter.

134
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:23,659
Scott: So it's not a big deal like the Ticket to Ride where, yeah, he was cheating, or at least accidentally cheating.

135
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:36,680
Scott: But the situation there where pro players at the top of the game, top 16 players in the world, something can slip by you that if you would have done it, they might not have fucking noticed.

136
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:44,620
Scott: It's really hard to pay attention to everything that's going on when you've been playing a game all for two days straight.

137
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:48,439
Rym: Ticket to Ride has very little going on.

138
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,402
Scott: That's true.

139
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:54,000
Scott: It's much harder in Ticket to Ride than in a more complicated game to get fucked up.

140
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,260
Scott: And to not notice, to let your opponent take two turns in a row.

141
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:26,219
Rym: The etiquette I've always seen in all my life playing real tabletop games, like the For Serious tabletop games, has been that among good people who are in that community, a lot of times you'll think you messed up a rule and you're not 100% sure, but the game's still kind of hidden information kind of game, and it seems like the unspoken policy is if you think you forgot to do something or you messed something up, you just correct it in the way that harms you the most.

142
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:30,120
Scott: I mean, in a tournament like that, you just call a judge over, right?

143
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:38,820
Scott: You're expected to police the game yourself, but if something happens that's fucked up, you just call the judge and you say, "Judge, this is the fucked up thing that happened,".

144
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,039
Scott: and they tell you the remedy.

145
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:45,500
Rym: Did you see that video someone posted in the forum of how to cheat at Magic with the deck shuffling?

146
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,040
Rym: And apparently it's super common.

147
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:54,020
Rym: You shuffle your opponent's deck, and once it's shuffled, you're not allowed to touch it until gameplay.

148
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,479
Rym: You can't alter it in any way.

149
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:57,858
Rym: So you can't cut it after they shuffle it.

150
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,240
Rym: Anyone who's played card games could basically deal out all lands or all spells to you and force you to mulligan.

151
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:09,200
Rym: And apparently this is the thing that's been happening.

152
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:13,880
Scott: I mean, if there's money at stake, people are going to practice those skills, right?

153
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,720
Scott: In other games, like Netrunner, Ticket to Ride, there's no money on the line.

154
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,083
Scott: So there's no reason.

155
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:22,860
Scott: It's not worth it to practice Slate of Hand to try to win a playmat and a statue.

156
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:31,039
Rym: But I guess the real bar, I don't even think about the idea of anyone cheating at any game I ever play, even tournaments, really.

157
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,820
Rym: What I do is, one, I only play with people who, if they cheated, that's like friend level betrayal.

158
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:42,800
Rym: And two, I'm more worried about them fucking up the rules because I just taught them the game.

159
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:48,680
Scott: Anyway, so, I guess there's a whole bunch of news crammed in that cheating article.

160
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,598
Scott: There was also a Hearthstone World Championship, which didn't have cheating at all.

161
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,000
Scott: But you should, even if you don't care about Hearthstone, just go on, because Blizzcon happened, there's a ton of stuff there.

162
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,260
Scott: But just go and look at the set and stage they had for the Hearthstone.

163
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:07,974
Scott: It was like this huge booth with a fire in it and shit.

164
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:12,360
Scott: So it was like a tavern off to the side.

165
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Rym: Yeah, you know what, this is something, so remember way back in 2002, Ostentatious Otakons felt like expo halls and things.

166
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:26,939
Rym: I'm really glad that we've kind of doubled down on the gaming cons, because production values be off the charts, yo.

167
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,799
Scott: Yeah, for reals.

168
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:32,828
Rym: So, my news is a short- That wasn't your news?

169
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:34,220
Scott: That took like how long?

170
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,140
Rym: You're just talking about games.

171
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,820
Scott: That took forever.

172
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,780
Rym: So my news is a succinct review of PAX Australia 2014.

173
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,400
Rym: Don't want to do a whole show on it, because if we review every convention we go to, you guys, this would be GeekNights, the convention.

174
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,174
Scott: This is the first PAX I haven't been to since '07.

175
00:10:50,360 --> 00:11:02,280
Rym: Yeah, and meanwhile, some PA/REED people, like some high up enforcers and people who have been to more PAXes than us, I've gained on a couple of them by one.

176
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,280
Scott: Not everyone can go to Australia every year.

177
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:07,639
Rym: I'm pretty much convinced I'm going next year now, too.

178
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:08,899
Scott: How is that going to happen?

179
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,620
Rym: So here's my succinct review of PAX Australia.

180
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:17,939
Rym: One, no longer in a big top, in a real convention center- That takes away some of the charm, doesn't it?

181
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:20,160
Rym: So, it makes it different.

182
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,800
Rym: That first PAX Australia- Minus charm, plus every other area?

183
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,542
Rym: You know what it's like?

184
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:30,360
Rym: It's like when PAX Prime moved to the real convention center in Seattle.

185
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,960
Scott: We never were at it before the real convention center.

186
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,779
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying like the difference in feeling that people talk about.

187
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,680
Rym: Or when MagFest moved from hotels to convention center.

188
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:41,079
Rym: The feel changed a lot.

189
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:47,100
Rym: So, I'm very glad I went to that first PAX Australia because that was most memorable.

190
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,719
Rym: But I'm glad it'll never be there again.

191
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:57,460
Rym: So, the new convention center is approaching as big as the Boston Convention Center.

192
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,619
Scott: The PAX East is at it.

193
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,759
Scott: I mean, we were outside of it when we were there last year.

194
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,303
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

195
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:01,887
Rym: We fucked up.

196
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:03,940
Rym: We looked at it and assumed it was X size.

197
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,680
Rym: We were not looking at the Melbourne Convention Center.

198
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,359
Rym: That is the Melbourne Exposition Center.

199
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,068
Rym: Way, way, way, way, way the fuck.

200
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,836
Rym: behind it, like connected far off.

201
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:17,559
Rym: where we never walked, is the Melbourne Convention Center.

202
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:19,600
Rym: PAX used both.

203
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:29,080
Rym: Yeah, so when we talked about how big that place was and looked it up, we were looking at half the space that it had available.

204
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,917
Scott: There we go.

205
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,540
Rym: We were looking at basically just the expo hall and queue room.

206
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,757
Scott: So, they put the expo hall in that building.

207
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:36,120
Rym: we saw.

208
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,558
Rym: The queue room, panel room.

209
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,139
Scott: And everything else was in another building, I don't know.

210
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,240
Rym: The far end of the building, we didn't see that.

211
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,640
Rym: The building's also way bigger than we thought.

212
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,660
Scott: I'm sure it has underground parts as well.

213
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,605
Rym: There was a lot.

214
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:48,440
Rym: So, there's the backend stuff.

215
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,839
Rym: There were offices for enforcers who had important jobs to do.

216
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:01,820
Rym: Enforcing at that con was a step above and beyond any other enforcing in terms of the facilities to which you had access to make your job easier.

217
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:04,514
Rym: There were observation decks.

218
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,680
Rym: you would look down on the floor through windows and check on stuff.

219
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:08,200
Rym: It was crazy.

220
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,620
Scott: Who architected this and when can we hire them to build a New York Convention Center?

221
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:17,118
Rym: So, it had the feels of the Hartford Convention Center, the Kineticons that.

222
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:17,779
Scott: Oh, okay.

223
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,580
Rym: That kind of feeling and vibe.

224
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:22,520
Rym: All the PAX stuff was there.

225
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,438
Rym: This PAX was a proper PAX, for real.

226
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:25,639
Rym: now.

227
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,139
Rym: And if I had to rank...

228
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:28,180
Scott: The other one wasn't proper?

229
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,359
Rym: It was weird.

230
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:31,399
Rym: It was off kilter a little bit.

231
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:32,497
Rym: If I had to rank PAX...

232
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,280
Scott: You said it was a real PAX last time when we did a show on it.

233
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:36,710
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

234
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:37,899
Rym: Now it's a real PAX.

235
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:43,357
Rym: Now... So, if I had to rank the PAXs in terms of PAXness, PAX Prime, number one.

236
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:43,873
Scott: Duh.

237
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,098
Rym: PAX Australia, number two.

238
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,319
Rym: PAX East, number three.

239
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:49,920
Rym: Like, for real.

240
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,140
Rym: PAX East feels way different than both Prime and Aus.

241
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,140
Rym: There's a big jump in the field.

242
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,518
Scott: Let's see what PAX South is up to.

243
00:13:58,183 --> 00:13:59,700
Rym: I'm really curious about PAX South.

244
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,579
Rym: Tabletop was rocking and pretty much full the entire time.

245
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:11,360
Rym: Once again, a three-day PAX closes at midnight, so they kind of lied to us back when they said that that was only because PAX Prime went to four days.

246
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,420
Rym: I think all PAXs end at midnight forever.

247
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,680
Rym: Tabletop library, wicked stocked.

248
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,160
Rym: Splendor tournament.

249
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:19,718
Rym: Did you win?

250
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:22,839
Rym: I didn't get to enter it because it conflicted with the panel I was on.

251
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,058
Rym: I was on three panels, not two.

252
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:27,679
Rym: You know what else conflicted?

253
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:30,079
Rym: And I'm really, really sad about this.

254
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:31,756
Rym: A Doom tournament.

255
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,020
Scott: You weren't in the Doom tournament?

256
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:38,540
Rym: No, and I got over there to watch the Doom tournament after my panel.

257
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,600
Scott: And you feel like you could have won?

258
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,059
Rym: I feel like I could have won.

259
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:42,440
Scott: No one else was doing wall running?

260
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,080
Rym: I could have won with my left fucking hand.

261
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,260
Scott: No one else was wall running and shit?

262
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,320
Rym: It was ZDoom, which is fine.

263
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:48,880
Scott: Fine, nothing wrong with ZDoom.

264
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,560
Rym: But yeah, no one knew how to wall run.

265
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,460
Rym: I don't think wall running is a known skill among the youth.

266
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:55,496
Scott: There you go.

267
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:59,180
Rym: Yeah, so I'm really a little salty about not being able to be in that tournament.

268
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,680
Scott: How many people were in the Doom tournament?

269
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:01,306
Rym: Oh, it was full.

270
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:02,679
Rym: People were really excited about it.

271
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,760
Scott: I remember at the first PAX Australia you tried to go to the Counter-Strike tournament.

272
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:06,559
Scott: Oh my god.

273
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,560
Rym: So I'm going to tell you about the one bad thing that happened at PAX Australia.

274
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,379
Scott: It was a bad thing?

275
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:15,059
Rym: I entered the gun game, well I guess they call it...

276
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,080
Scott: Oh, the Counter-Strike gun game.

277
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,200
Rym: Yes, I entered that tournament.

278
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:18,078
Scott: Oh, you actually got in?

279
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,046
Rym: Yeah, so 96 players.

280
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:20,639
Scott: Alright.

281
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,459
Rym: And they line us all up and they sit us down.

282
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:27,675
Rym: And so I sit down next to Bain and we're hanging out and we give each other GLHF.

283
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:34,180
Rym: And then we're ready to play and then no Enforcer ever comes over.

284
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,640
Rym: So eventually a guy comes over and says, "Alright, all of you here join server

285
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,382
Rym: 2.".

286
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:40,079
Rym: So we all join.

287
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,458
Rym: And then the guy at my left of me is like, "Ah, the server's

288
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:42,680
Rym: full.".

289
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:47,115
Rym: So we're like, "Sorry dude, I don't

290
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:47,216
Rym: know.".

291
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,120
Rym: So he's trying to flag down an Enforcer.

292
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:52,000
Rym: So we all just start playing gun game.

293
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:55,199
Rym: Next thing we know, an hour's gone by.

294
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,993
Rym: We've played like 11 matches.

295
00:15:58,465 --> 00:15:58,978
Scott: Who won them?

296
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:00,978
Rym: We kept track because we didn't know.

297
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,960
Rym: So eventually an Enforcer comes over and we're like, "So what's the format of the tournament?

298
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,573
Rym: What's going

299
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:06,779
Rym: on?".

300
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,206
Rym: And he's like,

301
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:07,267
Rym: "Oh.".

302
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:11,280
Rym: And basically the tournament just kind of failed and petered out.

303
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,400
Scott: Who was in charge of the tournament?

304
00:16:13,642 --> 00:16:14,398
Rym: I don't know.

305
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,340
Rym: But I reported that the tournament failed.

306
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:17,020
Rym: So basically...

307
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,840
Scott: That was an innocent Enforcer's job.

308
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,678
Scott: Enforcer fucked up.

309
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,800
Rym: The line to play in PC free play was crazy long.

310
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,780
Scott: Because all these people were sitting there playing gun game for an hour, not getting up.

311
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,239
Rym: No, PC tourney is a separate area.

312
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,460
Rym: So because that line was so long, they didn't give you too super much time to play in there.

313
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:42,040
Rym: So I just stayed in the tournament area playing Counter-Strike for a long time.

314
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,580
Scott: That's a good move.

315
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,280
Rym: And you know what?

316
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:44,280
Rym: Most of us did that.

317
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,758
Rym: And you know what?

318
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,979
Rym: It was still super fun.

319
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,614
Scott: Yeah, why not?

320
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,780
Rym: So I'm not mad about it, but sorry dudes.

321
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:52,080
Rym: You guys kind of fucked up that tournament, like for reals.

322
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,100
Scott: Learned to run tournaments.

323
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,620
Rym: There was a Galaga tournament.

324
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,519
Scott: Who won that?

325
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:56,299
Rym: I don't know.

326
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:03,122
Rym: Me and Alan were hanging out watching it for a while, but we didn't... The second guy goes up and gets like over 300,000.

327
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:03,273
Scott: Nice.

328
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:05,559
Scott: That's way better than... I love fucking Galaga.

329
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,800
Scott: I am not anywhere good.

330
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:12,839
Rym: So I hope they couldn't overhear me, because everyone came up, I'd watch them play for two seconds, and guess their final score.

331
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:17,353
Rym: In terms of order of magnitude, I was like, "That guy's not breaking

332
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:17,413
Rym: 10K.".

333
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,599
Rym: And sure enough, one guy, he was doing pretty well.

334
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,454
Rym: He got to like 90K, 100K, and then he got a death.

335
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,836
Scott: Did anyone do the secret?

336
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,379
Rym: Which secret?

337
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,960
Scott: Where you dodge all the guys in the first level, and then you kill that one guy at the right moment.

338
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,418
Rym: No, no one did anything like that.

339
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:40,740
Rym: But everyone was doing the double ship.

340
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,557
Rym: Anyone who didn't do the double ship at the first opportunity, it was like, "Okay,

341
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:43,838
Rym: guys.".

342
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,620
Rym: Or anyone who didn't have an extra life at the first opportunity, like, "Yeah, you're

343
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:47,912
Rym: done.".

344
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:53,839
Rym: One guy was doing pretty well, and then at one point he got an extra life, and then he did a derp die.

345
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:54,800
Rym: He just died derpily.

346
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,199
Rym: But he was still doing okay, but he had no lives left.

347
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,578
Rym: And then an opportunity came, and he did it.

348
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,140
Rym: So, you know, game over, because he didn't have any extra lives.

349
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:06,079
Scott: Oh, he double shipped.

350
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,079
Scott: He tried to double ship, but it was his last ship.

351
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:10,760
Rym: As soon as it starts happening, he suddenly goes, "Oh!

352
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:11,239
Rym: Oh no!

353
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:11,715
Rym: Oh no!

354
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:12,213
Rym: Oh no!

355
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:12,730
Rym: Oh

356
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:12,855
Rym: no!".

357
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,560
Rym: And he just drops the controller and walks away.

358
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,140
Rym: It was beautiful.

359
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,780
Scott: Is this an arcade Gallagher?

360
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:18,600
Rym: No, this was Atari something.

361
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,538
Rym: Like, a weird Atari controller was awesome.

362
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:21,317
Scott: All right.

363
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,260
Rym: What else is interesting about this pack?

364
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:27,020
Rym: The panels went off without a hitch.

365
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,900
Rym: People were bothering me the entire convention about him.

366
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:30,560
Scott: That's typical.

367
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,109
Rym: Yep.

368
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,419
Rym: People really like the losing panel that you never wanted to do.

369
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:43,680
Scott: Again, I feel like- I mean, it started out as a culture of losing, right?

370
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:44,659
Scott: At least to the police.

371
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,380
Scott: So, they need the help in that area.

372
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,780
Rym: But, yeah, this PAX was crazy awesome.

373
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:56,520
Rym: If I had to rank gaming cons, period.

374
00:18:57,582 --> 00:18:59,699
Rym: All gaming cons that I would ever go to.

375
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Rym: The order is now, PAX Prime, Magfest, PAX OSS, PAX East.

376
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,259
Rym: Gaming for hope if it still exists.

377
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,599
Rym: Because that's actually a super fun con if it still exists.

378
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,077
Rym: So, yeah.

379
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:15,918
Rym: That's it.

380
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,100
Scott: All right.

381
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,440
Scott: So, let's talk about- I guess we talked about the world championships of things.

382
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,419
Scott: So, now let's just talk about the- What's it called?

383
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,039
Scott: The Blizzard TF2 thingy.

384
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,899
Scott: What's the name of this thing that they're coming out with?

385
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:28,540
Scott: Overwatch?

386
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,125
Rym: Yeah.

387
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:29,859
Scott: Right.

388
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,080
Scott: So, Blizzard is making- We already knew that they're making a competing game to compete against the MOBAs.

389
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,540
Scott: that's going to be all streamlined and whatnot.

390
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:47,420
Scott: It seems like they're going to compete with TF2 with this Overwatch in the sort of low barrier to entry team FPS department.

391
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:53,320
Rym: I sold all the old items that I just had from long ago on TF2 and I got like 10 bucks each for everything.

392
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:53,893
Scott: Oh, wow.

393
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,920
Scott: I've never sold anything for that much.

394
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,479
Rym: I made a ton of fucking money on Steam.

395
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,800
Scott: I think it's because you might have actually played Team Fortress 2 in the hat era.

396
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,640
Rym: I played it in the beginning and I got a bunch of items right then and then I never played again.

397
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:13,279
Scott: See, I played it in the beginning before there were items so I only had- The items I had didn't go for that much when I sold them a long time ago.

398
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:17,558
Rym: Okay, so I just Googled for Overwatch just because I wanted to have the thing up, like have some info.

399
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,460
Rym: That's how we sound smart on GeekNights.

400
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,779
Rym: We're looking at our computers the whole time.

401
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:27,660
Rym: The first actual search result is summarized by Google because it's a long title.

402
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,653
Rym: So all it says is, "With Overwatch, Blizzard is trying to do women.

403
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:32,716
Rym: Kotaku.".

404
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,300
Scott: So anyway.

405
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:50,459
Scott: Yeah, people are, you know, even not knowing anything about the game, people are praising Blizzard because they've posted basically pictures of all the different classes that you could be and there are many women and peoples of color in all shapes and sizes as I guess you should.

406
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,020
Scott: But, you know, on the one hand, it's like, "Okay, yeah, you should do that.

407
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:56,632
Scott: That's a great

408
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:56,918
Scott: thing.".

409
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:03,179
Scott: But it also hints tiny bit of, "We did it so that we would get praised for

410
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,320
Scott: it.".

411
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,920
Scott: If someone does a good thing for a greedy reason, it's okay.

412
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:16,480
Rym: If Hitler saves a puppy, Hitler did a good thing and deserves praise for that one good thing.

413
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,139
Scott: Not for the other things to me.

414
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:19,376
Rym: Notice how I said that?

415
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,120
Scott: This is the same Blizzard that has like, you know, sexy dancing elves in World of Warcraft, right?

416
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:28,800
Scott: This is not really, you know, which part of their culture changed?

417
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,417
Scott: Do they fire and hire people, you know?

418
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:33,720
Rym: Wait, wait, what are you, some kind of social justice warrior?

419
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,580
Scott: Have you seen the mage in Hearthstone, right?

420
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,036
Rym: Oh my god.

421
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,260
Rym: That's not the worst thing in the world, but still.

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,679
Rym: But yeah, I'm not super confident that it's a game I will like, which is interesting.

423
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:50,551
Scott: If you like TF2 and TF2 is getting old, this is probably a better choice.

424
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:51,619
Scott: that's going to be more modern.

425
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,220
Rym: But at the same time, what's our complaint about MOBA?

426
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,998
Rym: Our complaints about MOBA is the reason we don't play.

427
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:05,359
Rym: MOBA is the reason normal humans don't play those old games like Team Fortress Classic and Weapons Factory.

428
00:22:06,602 --> 00:22:11,238
Rym: So, this is basically... But I'm old now.

429
00:22:12,102 --> 00:22:12,540
Rym: Exactly.

430
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,218
Rym: What Team Fortress was to those people, this might be to us.

431
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:20,539
Rym: For MOBAs.

432
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,040
Scott: Maybe we'll play them.

433
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,659
Scott: But Team Fortress 2 already exists.

434
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,057
Rym: But that's an FPS.

435
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:28,858
Scott: This is also an FPS.

436
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,959
Rym: Yeah, but we'll see how the gameplay actually works out.

437
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:46,839
Scott: I think the big difference here is the Overwatch game is supposedly not going to be like capture the flag as much as it is more like an FPS MOBA a lot like... There are some other FPS MOBAs out there.

438
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,554
Rym: We keep saying FPS.

439
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,217
Rym: I think we should just say FP.

440
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:52,079
Scott: Whatever.

441
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,019
Rym: Or first person.

442
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,000
Scott: But it's going to be like Team Fortress 2 level of barrier to entry and whatnot.

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,377
Scott: I don't know.

444
00:22:59,267 --> 00:22:59,520
Scott: Interesting.

445
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:08,559
Rym: Of course, at the same time I just click on this article here and all I see is this naked elf butt with a lot of Rym light on it.

446
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,000
Scott: Well, there you go.

447
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,600
Rym: So, I guess it's not an elf.

448
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,659
Rym: It's a human with blue skin because there's no point of year there.

449
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:17,937
Rym: That butt's kind of disturbing because you can see way into it.

450
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:21,959
Scott: Compared to the major's butt on a scale of one to major.

451
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,119
Rym: Dude, this is like 0.6 major butts.

452
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,479
Rym: This is a for real butt.

453
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:28,860
Scott: Is it a cyborg butt?

454
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:30,620
Rym: I don't know.

455
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,560
Scott: Or is it a flesh butt?

456
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,276
Rym: I don't know what kind of butt it is.

457
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,298
Scott: It's like you're a butt expert.

458
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:38,100
Rym: I'm not much of an expert.

459
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,420
Scott: You're just a poop expert.

460
00:23:40,324 --> 00:23:40,959
Scott: Poops and clocks.

461
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,679
Rym: Yeah, you know what we were talking about the other day?

462
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:43,280
Rym: Poop report.

463
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,119
Scott: That's your thing.

464
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:45,919
Rym: I feel like I should start reading that again.

465
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,340
Rym: So, also super brief news.

466
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Rym: Five Nights at Freddy's was popular and successful.

467
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,820
Rym: There's already a sequel.

468
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:54,720
Scott: That was fast.

469
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:56,560
Rym: Five Nights at Freddy's 2.

470
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:56,895
Scott: That was fast.

471
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,060
Rym: Little salty about that.

472
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,240
Scott: Didn't you die in the first one?

473
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
Scott: How is there a second one already?

474
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:01,499
Rym: Different person.

475
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,380
Rym: Okay.

476
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,320
Rym: I guess it follows the continuity.

477
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:10,420
Rym: If you'd listen to my lecture on losing, you'd understand the narrative of failure versus the narrative of success.

478
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,100
Rym: This is the narrative of success.

479
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:19,299
Rym: The guy survived Five Nights at Freddy's, got fired, and I guess they reopened Five Nights at Freddy's with new safety measures.

480
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:23,899
Rym: Basically, they give you a Freddy mask you can wear.

481
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:25,840
Rym: So, the things won't kill you anymore.

482
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,479
Rym: I'm assuming that just doesn't fucking work.

483
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,760
Rym: So, we'll see.

484
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,819
Scott: Just put it on and leave it on.

485
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,940
Rym: There are already like a hundred live streams of this game.

486
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,280
Rym: So, you can see where gaming culture is going.

487
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,569
Rym: Things of the day.

488
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:50,090
Rym: So, Scott, have you ever heard of Rat Boy Genius Dreams?

489
00:24:50,618 --> 00:24:50,785
Scott: No.

490
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:51,769
Rym: Okay.

491
00:24:52,590 --> 00:25:02,470
Rym: Rat Boy Genius Dreams is one of those things that shows that we're old and it's one of those things that's very popular among the Minecraft kid sets.

492
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:03,130
Scott: All right.

493
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,850
Scott: Then it'll be popular among the Rym set as well.

494
00:25:06,217 --> 00:25:06,366
Rym: No.

495
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,367
Rym: Not by default, no.

496
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,488
Rym: Because I don't like those things.

497
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:10,470
Scott: But you like all sorts of weird shit.

498
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:11,450
Rym: I do like weird shit.

499
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,070
Rym: So, this is where these things intersect.

500
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:22,486
Rym: While that is where this thing is from, what it is is so internet that you just have to watch it.

501
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:27,750
Rym: This is official, the official version of Potato Knishes.

502
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,230
Scott: Potato Knishes are pretty delicious.

503
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,129
Rym: That kind of rhymed.

504
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:35,190
Rym: That's the point.

505
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,289
Rym: I defy you to not get this song stuck in your head.

506
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:38,990
Scott: All right.

507
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:39,949
Rym: So, yeah.

508
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,789
Rym: That's my thing of the day.

509
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,470
Scott: If it gets stuck in my head, I can just like deploy 10 K-pop songs at you.

510
00:25:45,772 --> 00:25:45,860
Rym: Yeah.

511
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:50,750
Rym: I was watching some old PMVs the other day and that fixed me from this song.

512
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,207
Scott: There you go.

513
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,458
Scott: Yeah.

514
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:52,309
Scott: All right.

515
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,550
Scott: So, usually when you see a dash cam video, right?

516
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:02,730
Scott: The person with the cam is in the right and they catch something on their cam that is not in the right.

517
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:09,330
Scott: For example, the typical Russian scenario of slamming on the brakes so that someone will hit you from behind, you get the insurance, whatever.

518
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,289
Scott: So, this guy with the cam is actually tailgating.

519
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,690
Scott: He is not driving well.

520
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:22,509
Scott: I mean, I guess he's not driving super dangerously, but he's definitely tailgating the guy in front of him, which is not cool.

521
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:29,833
Scott: He tailgated the wrong motherfucker and his cam captured all and I'm surprised he uploaded it.

522
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,529
Rym: I don't think we should even spoil it.

523
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,490
Scott: Just watch this and if you're in China, just don't tailgate anybody.

524
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,250
Scott: No matter where you live, if you're driving, don't tailgate anyone.

525
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:46,430
Scott: All I want to say is- But, if you are tailgating someone, just pretend that it's this dude and you will stop.

526
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,890
Rym: This looks like a scene from a movie trailer.

527
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:59,870
Scott: The guy who the guy could be, I would hire him to be in a movie and also I want the driving gloves that he has.

528
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:06,950
Rym: Because that is the kind of thing that happens in the kinds of Asian cinema that we like and actually haven't been watching a lot of movies in that genre lately.

529
00:27:08,352 --> 00:27:11,770
Scott: You know, there's also a small possibility this could have been staged just for awesomeness.

530
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:13,268
Rym: Yeah, could have been.

531
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:14,349
Scott: I don't care if it was.

532
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:15,310
Rym: I don't care either.

533
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,508
Scott: I'm betting it wasn't though.

534
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:24,130
Rym: In the meta moment, the Book Club book is finally going to be announced and it is the classic, the famous Watership Down.

535
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,270
Rym: Yeah, Scott's super enthusiastic about rabbits.

536
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,224
Rym: So, this book is one of the first books to ever do the thing that it did the way that it did it.

537
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:38,030
Rym: It's arguably one of the earlier inspirations for things that later became like Mouse Guard, for example.

538
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,970
Rym: Like that genre- Don't you mean Redwall?

539
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:41,661
Rym: Yeah.

540
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,390
Rym: Redwall's actually quite different.

541
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:45,469
Scott: Oh, really?

542
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:45,656
Scott: Yes.

543
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:47,110
Scott: In what way?

544
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:50,808
Rym: We'll do our Book Club show about it.

545
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,190
Rym: Eh, right.

546
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,549
Rym: It's closer to Rats of NIMH.

547
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:54,730
Scott: Animal Farm?

548
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,068
Rym: There are plenty of animal store novel fictions.

549
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,210
Rym: You'll see when I read the book.

550
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,270
Scott: There are plenty of fictions involving talking animals.

551
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:02,910
Scott: Charlotte's Web?

552
00:28:03,411 --> 00:28:07,730
Rym: Talking animals is not the sole thing that makes this that possible for Janitor.

553
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,549
Scott: But it's the primary.

554
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:11,589
Rym: Eh, actually I don't think so.

555
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:12,629
Scott: You don't think so?

556
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,327
Rym: No, I don't think so.

557
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:16,630
Rym: Also, a lot of the art people I know really like this book.

558
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,090
Rym: And a lot of the people I know who like things like Mouse Guard like this book.

559
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:25,230
Rym: And a lot of people reference this book often and you probably don't realize it.

560
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,430
Scott: That's probably true, yeah.

561
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:26,519
Rym: Yeah.

562
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:35,170
Scott: So I'm going to just have to work really hard to get through this book and also find a book that I will enjoy very much that Rym will feel similarly about.

563
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,770
Rym: Scott, don't go down that fucking road.

564
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,864
Rym: So Scott, I'm turning around.

565
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,550
Rym: I'm not actually doing it because this is not video.

566
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,849
Rym: You're turning around with- This is the guy in Scott's Thing of the Day made.

567
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,508
Rym: Don't start this.

568
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,509
Rym: Because this road, the road you're on- Leads to a certain dumbass.

569
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,430
Scott: It leads to Alexandre Dumas.

570
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,549
Scott: A certain dumbass.

571
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:55,969
Rym: It leads to Dumas.

572
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,708
Rym: And you know what?

573
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:07,270
Rym: Which Dumas depends it- Should I just at this point, if he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send ten of him to the three musketeers.

574
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:11,366
Scott: I'd rather read that than your- Count of Monte Cristo?

575
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:11,810
Rym: Yeah.

576
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,530
Rym: Which is possibly his best work.

577
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:15,749
Scott: Listen, we don't got time for that.

578
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:16,264
Rym: I do.

579
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,168
Scott: No, we don't.

580
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,010
Scott: Yeah, because you already spent that time.

581
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,689
Scott: That time is spent.

582
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,270
Rym: In another meta bit, we made a new kind of video.

583
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,390
Rym: It's a kind of GeekNights programming we've never done before.

584
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:28,484
Rym: So we did it.

585
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,590
Rym: We uploaded a raw version of it on YouTube, partly to get comments.

586
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:46,189
Rym: What this is, Scott and I put on microphones, grabbed a camera, and literally just did what we do and have done at every expo hall and dealer's room of every convention for the last decade plus, but we recorded it.

587
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:54,530
Scott: Yeah, I mean, people go to pecs and they go to the expo hall or whatever and they spend way too much fucking time in there waiting in lines and doing other stupid shit.

588
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,109
Scott: How long is this video?

589
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,380
Rym: This video is only 37 minutes long.

590
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,058
Rym: It's edited down, right?

591
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:04,849
Rym: Here's what is not included in this video.

592
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:21,050
Rym: Every time we were just fighting through a crowd, every time we had a conversation with a friend that we bumped into, every time I went to the bathroom or something, and the indie mega booth, because that is not expo hall.

593
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:21,889
Rym: That is the indie mega booth.

594
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,469
Scott: That's about an hour's worth of stuff.

595
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:32,590
Scott: It still means that if any of you give us a whole hour, even if you give us two hours for that, that is the entire pecs expo hall done in two and a half hours.

596
00:30:32,992 --> 00:30:36,409
Scott: You walk around, you look around, and then you're done, and then you play tabletop games.

597
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:44,170
Rym: So, if you have any comments about this, let us know, because we're going to do this with much higher production values at pretty much every pecs forever now.

598
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:50,690
Scott: Yeah, I mean, we had to do it sort of crappily to learn lessons, to do it less crappily next time, but monopod will definitely be awesome.

599
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:58,730
Rym: Honestly, considering how crappily and quickly we threw this together, like doing it, a surprising number of gem choice moments occurred.

600
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:08,869
Scott: There are, I mean, I watched it, which I usually don't watch or listen to our own shit, but I wanted to see, and for all the parts that are not so good, there are a bunch of parts that are pretty good.

601
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:09,730
Rym: That guy.

602
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,350
Scott: I mean, I think you overdid it a little bit, you know, with that guy.

603
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,190
Rym: That guy, are you kidding?

604
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,330
Rym: Do you know how many people have already like commented on YouTube or been like, "That guy was the best part of the video.

605
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,085
Rym: That guy, that guy, that

606
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:20,208
Rym: guy.".

607
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,030
Scott: Yeah, those are the same people who like shit like your thing of the day.

608
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,363
Rym: Yeah.

609
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:26,049
Rym: Do you know what the song I used was from?

610
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:28,489
Scott: I don't remember the song.

611
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:30,789
Rym: Does anyone out there know what the song is just from?

612
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,569
Scott: I had to listen to it again.

613
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,499
Rym: All right, I'll bet you don't.

614
00:31:34,632 --> 00:31:35,968
Rym: The brain thing was pretty good.

615
00:31:37,337 --> 00:31:37,510
Scott: I know.

616
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:45,170
Rym: The moment where we're walking around, we walk by basically the saddest fake laptop in the world, and it's an Xbox.

617
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,667
Scott: Oh, the Xbox in the briefcase.

618
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:50,310
Rym: And I start laughing at it because like they're all updating.

619
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,490
Scott: Listen, there is someone in the world who needs that.

620
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,610
Rym: Yeah, but the conversation we had there was pretty good.

621
00:31:56,092 --> 00:32:04,569
Rym: The fact that all the Xboxes were updating at PAX and no one could play them was just too ironically delicious, and Scott thought it was a PS3.

622
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,130
Scott: I mean, I didn't look at it very closely.

623
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,930
Rym: But no, this video was surprisingly watchable.

624
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:11,969
Rym: I was really surprised.

625
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:15,530
Rym: Also, that guy with the dice fetish, I think he wins the prize.

626
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,449
Scott: That guy's an awesome guy.

627
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,027
Rym: Yeah, he was.

628
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,950
Rym: Just don't go into his dice dungeon.

629
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:20,388
Rym: Maybe.

630
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:23,090
Scott: We'll make better videos like this at other times.

631
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:23,889
Rym: Yeah, we will.

632
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:27,009
Scott: Can we actually do the show now?

633
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:27,829
Rym: Oh, yeah.

634
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:28,828
Rym: So Smash Brothers.

635
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:30,281
Scott: Came out on the 3DS.

636
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:38,769
Scott: The first time ever that there has been a portable Smash Brothers, and it is here, and we have had it for some weeks now.

637
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,643
Rym: I was highly dubious when this was first announced, this whole.

638
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:49,190
Rym: there's a Wii U and a 3DS one, because Nintendo has ignored the linkages between their devices since Four Swords.

639
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:53,250
Rym: Like they just, they fucking just dropped that train, even though it was-.

640
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:58,766
Scott: Well, the only linkage here is that you can use the 3DS one as a controller for playing the Wii one.

641
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,388
Scott: Which is okay.

642
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:04,330
Scott: If you get used to the 3DS controls, it's basically the same game, right?

643
00:33:05,312 --> 00:33:08,569
Scott: If you get used to that as your controller, why switch it up?

644
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:13,387
Rym: Who can play any Smash Brothers that's not on the DS without a GameCube controller at this point?

645
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:14,428
Scott: You just can't.

646
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,050
Rym: So I was highly dubious that it would not be dumbed down in some fashion.

647
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:20,529
Rym: It's a real Smash.

648
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:21,099
Rym: Yeah.

649
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:22,490
Rym: Like it's a real Smash Brothers.

650
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,127
Rym: It's legit.

651
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,969
Rym: It's all the fun and everything that Smash Brothers has always been.

652
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,549
Rym: And for a Smash Brothers, if you like Smash Brothers, you're obligated to get it, because it's the one.

653
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:32,902
Scott: Yep.

654
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:41,290
Scott: I mean, as far as competitiveness goes, going on the words of other people, they say it's legit, but I'm not, I can't even, I know there's a thing called the Wave Dash.

655
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:44,130
Scott: I can't do it and wouldn't even know if I did it by accident.

656
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:45,530
Rym: Oh my God.

657
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:47,490
Rym: Never play this game with Scott.

658
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:53,241
Rym: If items are on, you will get nothing but him bitching about how the items ruin the game.

659
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,330
Rym: Even though somehow the items only ever kill him, so something's up there.

660
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:04,610
Scott: We could play again with, if you play enough times with items, some games, one person will get the good items and some games, the other person will get the good items.

661
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,170
Rym: You just don't, it's not about, I didn't get good items.

662
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,870
Rym: I just use the items effectively.

663
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,688
Rym: They're a part of the game.

664
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,610
Scott: But the problem is which item appears and who it appears near.

665
00:34:14,434 --> 00:34:17,109
Rym: If a good item appears near your opponent, don't let him fucking get it.

666
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,989
Scott: It's kind of hard to do if you're far away and it appears at that moment.

667
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:20,868
Rym: Why are you far away, Scott?

668
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,070
Rym: Didn't you tell me that you should never be far away?

669
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,068
Rym: Wasn't that your other bitch?

670
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:30,510
Rym: So if I play fast and close to Scott, he bitches about how like, how come that hit me?

671
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,969
Rym: Uh, Scott, because of frame timing.

672
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,989
Rym: Frame timing is bullshit.

673
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,949
Scott: They should explain it.

674
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,730
Rym: And if I hang far away from him, he's like, how come you're hiding from me?

675
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:37,850
Rym: How come you're hiding from me?

676
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:38,708
Rym: Why don't you get up close?

677
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:41,510
Rym: And I get up close and I start like frame timing him again.

678
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,070
Rym: He's like, frame time's bullshit.

679
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,630
Scott: You don't know any frame timing balls.

680
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,510
Scott: You can just say that.

681
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:45,830
Scott: Scott.

682
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,770
Scott: Well, you don't know shit.

683
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,380
Rym: You had like, no.

684
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,510
Scott: If you had to play against a pro smash to play, you probably wouldn't even hit them even once.

685
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,687
Rym: I hit him one more time than you.

686
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,389
Scott: So zero times.

687
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:55,909
Scott: So, and then you start bitching.

688
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:56,728
Scott: I'm not saying I would hit him.

689
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:59,170
Rym: But then you start bitching like, oh, we got to play final.

690
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,050
Rym: We can't play these maps.

691
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,670
Scott: But I won on that final destination.

692
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:03,990
Rym: Yeah, barely.

693
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,909
Rym: It was a pretty solid.

694
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:06,989
Rym: Also, so you barely won and.

695
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,890
Scott: I won about half the games he played.

696
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:09,410
Rym: Yeah.

697
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,390
Rym: You barely won the final destination.

698
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:16,130
Rym: And I killed myself because I just jumped off the stage.

699
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,110
Scott: He was talking like he was like completely dominating.

700
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,215
Scott: Right.

701
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,410
Scott: We played many variations of different maps, different characters.

702
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:22,850
Scott: Items, no items.

703
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:23,430
Scott: Winning, losing.

704
00:35:23,711 --> 00:35:25,070
Scott: And we won about the same rate.

705
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:31,790
Rym: My only point is that Scott playing this game with Scott, whether or not you were winning or losing is nothing but a litany of him bitching.

706
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:34,409
Rym: That is my only point.

707
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,990
Scott: But I'm not bitching like, you know, like John's where it's like excuses for losing.

708
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,290
Scott: I'm bitching like, why is the game this way?

709
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,228
Scott: Explain it to me.

710
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,910
Scott: And no one, even pro people.

711
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:44,690
Scott: Right.

712
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,649
Scott: Can't explain it.

713
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,169
Scott: And it's the same.

714
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,730
Scott: It's basically the same shit you have with.

715
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,210
Rym: It's got wise counter strike that way.

716
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:49,750
Rym: Explain.

717
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,768
Scott: There is nothing to it.

718
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,321
Scott: There is nothing in counter strike.

719
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:53,410
Scott: that is mysterious.

720
00:35:54,471 --> 00:36:00,030
Rym: So, Scott, do you know what, how much damage reduction is applied by every different surface you can shoot through?

721
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,270
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

722
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:05,930
Rym: Do you know the points to preshoot, to get guaranteed headshots and all the sniper spots?

723
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,589
Scott: That also doesn't really matter.

724
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:09,250
Rym: That matters more.

725
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,910
Scott: But it's not like in counter strike, you're playing and it's like, why did I die?

726
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,070
Scott: It's like, well, because it's exactly like that.

727
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,190
Scott: No, it's because somebody saw you had their mouse pointed at you and press the button.

728
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:21,550
Rym: Why did you die that one time in smash?

729
00:36:21,832 --> 00:36:24,169
Rym: Because I use the toad counter, which is way powerful.

730
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:35,229
Scott: But there's never a situation in counter strike where, for example, I click on someone and bullets don't come out or the bullets, you know, just didn't do any damage, even though they hit.

731
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,049
Rym: Yeah, that happens all the time.

732
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:36,710
Rym: There's bullets scattered.

733
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,810
Rym: So you've got the crosshair point.

734
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:48,829
Scott: I'm saying even though they hit and you miss, there's never a situation where I aim at someone and the bullets just go in the opposite direction for no reason or, you know, nothing.

735
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:49,889
Scott: that doesn't make sense.

736
00:36:50,231 --> 00:36:55,190
Scott: Just, you know, common sense wise, the details of how much damage was done.

737
00:36:55,571 --> 00:36:56,210
Scott: So it's a thing.

738
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,429
Rym: I use the toad counter and it fucked you up.

739
00:36:58,671 --> 00:36:59,368
Rym: Then you ate me.

740
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,129
Rym: And you use the toad counter and I hit you.

741
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:10,129
Rym: And the reason I hit you in that moment where you went crazy was because I was attacking you from a downward angle above the toad.

742
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,990
Rym: That makes sense even in the animation of the game.

743
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:19,790
Scott: But here's the thing that you're not seeing is that you're just looking at what's on the screen as someone who's playing the game.

744
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:25,870
Scott: It's like at that moment I was pressing buttons and they're both buttons cause no reaction whatsoever.

745
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:26,810
Scott: Right.

746
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:32,069
Scott: And in Counter-Strike, at least if I press a button, even if I die instantly, bullets come out.

747
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:32,199
Rym: No.

748
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,750
Rym: So if you jump, try to jump again right away.

749
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,127
Rym: Doesn't work.

750
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:37,988
Scott: Yeah, it does.

751
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:39,049
Scott: You can jump twice.

752
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,629
Rym: Not the, you don't play much Counter-Strike, do you?

753
00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:44,870
Rym: You slow down when you jump.

754
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,969
Rym: Your guy gets all fucked up when you jump.

755
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,070
Scott: Oh, you're talking about Counter-Strike.

756
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:49,970
Scott: I thought you had Smash Brothers.

757
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,370
Rym: No.

758
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,510
Rym: But Smash Brothers.

759
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,309
Rym: So, right.

760
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,009
Scott: But it's, but it's like if I'm playing, I'm playing a game.

761
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:55,549
Scott: Yeah.

762
00:37:55,751 --> 00:38:01,446
Scott: And I press a button and then the expected reaction of pressing that button does not occur.

763
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,350
Scott: That is where this, the root of frustration, and it happens so fast.

764
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,567
Scott: That's a really slow move.

765
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,370
Scott: There's no explanation for it.

766
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,830
Rym: So you hit the button to start a slow move.

767
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,570
Scott: I'm a slow and old person.

768
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,710
Rym: While my foot was, my peach foot was already about to hit you in the face.

769
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:18,450
Rym: That was the problem.

770
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,829
Rym: You hit the button way too late.

771
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:27,709
Scott: But that's the problem is if it's already past the point of no return, I should have been hit already as opposed to, it looks like I'm about to get hit.

772
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,110
Scott: There are still frames of animation happening.

773
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:35,470
Scott: If I'm not actually hit yet, then it feels like I should be able to press a button to do something.

774
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,070
Rym: Because you could have hit a different button to do a faster attack.

775
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:42,270
Rym: Use a jab, use a jab instead of a heavy attack in Street Fighter.

776
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:49,290
Scott: But Smash Brothers, are you telling me that if someone's hitting you, you can press, there's only one button to press in Smash Brothers, which is A.

777
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,277
Rym: So Scott, if you just hit A.

778
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:51,950
Scott: If you push A and I push A, who wins?

779
00:38:52,674 --> 00:38:55,110
Scott: We push A at the exact same time and we're both next to each other.

780
00:38:55,512 --> 00:38:56,229
Rym: Exact same time?

781
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,930
Scott: We're both exactly next to each other.

782
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:03,909
Scott: We're in range of A and we both just press A. We use a robot that presses both A buttons simultaneously.

783
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:04,550
Rym: All right.

784
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,710
Rym: Well, it depends on the characters.

785
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,710
Scott: So give me a whole list of all the possible combinations.

786
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,129
Rym: Go look that up.

787
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,170
Rym: I'm sure someone's written a guide.

788
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,330
Scott: This is the kind of bullshit.

789
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,969
Scott: But the thing is, if you haven't memorized that.

790
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:20,829
Rym: Scott, what happens if two hockey players hit the puck as robots in the exact same time, the exact same way?

791
00:39:20,912 --> 00:39:21,306
Rym: Tell me.

792
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:22,428
Rym: Tell me right now.

793
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:28,290
Scott: Every combination of things that can happen, the two sticks will hit the puck and the puck will be stuck between the sticks with my timing.

794
00:39:29,331 --> 00:39:35,949
Rym: If I hit the ball, if I hit the puck at a slightly at all these different angles, tell me now exactly how that's all going to play out.

795
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:46,810
Scott: This is the thing is that there's so many possible combinations and timings of every possible move that's just in every possible position that Scott is too old to play fighting games, obviously.

796
00:39:47,211 --> 00:40:03,862
Scott: But as you are playing it, if you are not an expert, if you are not a pro player, it can be frustrating because the expected result of just natural common sense, how you feel it should be, does not match the reality in any

797
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:08,150
Rym: way more than you, because what happens matches what I expect.

798
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:18,568
Scott: Like if you're Kirby and you do your like rock coming down, like if I turn into a rock and I'm staying in rock form, I expect to be pretty much invincible unless you use a grab to pick me up.

799
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:25,548
Rym: Scott, I'm piloting a robot with a propeller probably made out of like titanium and diamond or some shit.

800
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,610
Rym: Rocks can be easily broken.

801
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:28,850
Rym: What kind of rock is this?

802
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,130
Rym: Scott?

803
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:29,930
Rym: What kind of rock?

804
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,481
Rym: How do you know?

805
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:30,890
Rym: it's not talc?

806
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:31,890
Scott: It's made of Kirby.

807
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,729
Scott: It's very much the hardest rock ever.

808
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,810
Rym: Kirby's not made out of rock.

809
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,430
Scott: Kirby's a Kirby.

810
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,430
Scott: He turns into rock.

811
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,407
Rym: What kind of rock?

812
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:39,350
Rym: Yeah.

813
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,150
Scott: That's what I thought.

814
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,250
Rym: That's what I thought.

815
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:42,664
Scott: Bismuth?

816
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,464
Scott: I don't fucking know.

817
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,270
Rym: There was a study.

818
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,250
Rym: I don't know if I'll build it.

819
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,550
Rym: I'll try to find the link to link to it in the show notes.

820
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:57,644
Rym: If I don't, I'll try to find it and link it in the forum, but the study showed that people who I believe are over the age of 24, I think 24 was the line.

821
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,129
Scott: Reaction times are garbage.

822
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,749
Rym: It's not that reaction times are garbage.

823
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:13,647
Rym: It's that the reaction times will slow in terms of how quick your finger actually moves, but you will perceive and feel as though you clicked or moved quicker than you physically did.

824
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:14,430
Scott: That's probably true.

825
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,029
Rym: Your body straight up lies to you.

826
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:17,002
Scott: That's 100% true.

827
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:26,729
Rym: You think you hit B before my foot got to your character's face, but in reality you hit it like after you were taking damage and your brain just lied to you.

828
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:27,568
Scott: That's right.

829
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:33,370
Rym: So just play enough to be able to compensate for that a little bit.

830
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,528
Rym: Like expect that.

831
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:35,307
Rym: You're old.

832
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,648
Rym: You're going to die soon.

833
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:38,599
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, it's over.

834
00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:41,228
Rym: We're done.

835
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:41,770
Rym: We're dead.

836
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:46,528
Scott: The thing I always wondered, right, is like all fighting games, you know, competitive or not.

837
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:46,970
Scott: Right.

838
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:56,170
Scott: It's like you push a button and an animation, you know, begins when you press the button and you know, some moves can cancel the animation to switch to something else.

839
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:56,330
Scott: Yeah.

840
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,869
Rym: Like if I'm doing a release, but others, others can't.

841
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:07,769
Rym: So like if my character's hauling back to do a really hard punch and someone else hits me with a jab, imagine if you're hauling back to do a really strong punch slowly and someone just jabs you in the kidney.

842
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:08,287
Scott: Right.

843
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:09,450
Scott: Obviously that makes sense.

844
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,670
Rym: It's going to disrupt your animation.

845
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:27,470
Scott: But if I, you know, push the haul back to punch button and I see your animation of jab begin, if I put, I should be able to, while that haul back animation is not yet completed, I expect to be able to push a different button to switch things up.

846
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,927
Rym: Now you say that, but if I somehow push it in time, you say that, have you ever studied a martial art?

847
00:42:33,856 --> 00:42:34,510
Scott: Not really.

848
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:35,850
Scott: Not anything that would count.

849
00:42:35,913 --> 00:42:36,108
Rym: Okay.

850
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,280
Rym: Go.

851
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,070
Rym: I was going to say not counting like taekwondo in elementary school.

852
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:39,380
Rym: Yeah.

853
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:52,750
Rym: So let's say you're doing some sort of like uppercut pumps, like for real, like you're doing like an uppercut and then suddenly you see that your opponent has a jab coming in with one of their hands at your unguarded, a soft and tender kidney.

854
00:42:53,630 --> 00:43:00,870
Rym: How quickly can you as a human redirect your body's momentum to react to that?

855
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:05,589
Scott: Me as a human, I couldn't even do the uppercut to begin with, but I admit not me as a human.

856
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,216
Scott: This is Kirby.

857
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,910
Scott: It was a pink ball of puff.

858
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,809
Rym: You don't know what Kirby's musculature is like.

859
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,910
Rym: What is circulatory systems like?

860
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:13,730
Scott: He's a hundred percent muscle.

861
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,029
Scott: In fact, that he doesn't even have a skin.

862
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,268
Scott: It's just exposed muscle.

863
00:43:16,952 --> 00:43:18,169
Scott: A hundred percent muscles.

864
00:43:19,232 --> 00:43:21,550
Scott: Kirby is nothing but power.

865
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:22,929
Rym: Wait, so he's muscle up.

866
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,090
Rym: Scott, I'm riding a metal machine.

867
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,809
Scott: Samus is a metal machine.

868
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:27,730
Rym: Which Samus was?

869
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:28,430
Rym: Zero suit Samus.

870
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,009
Rym: That's just a girl.

871
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:30,370
Scott: That's even stronger.

872
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:31,050
Rym: I know.

873
00:43:32,371 --> 00:43:32,809
Scott: Right?

874
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,550
Scott: I mean, Link has a sword.

875
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:39,390
Scott: If I sword you and you're punching, your hand should be chopped up.

876
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:41,169
Scott: I mean, we're not going to take it that far, right?

877
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,810
Rym: But you know, it's just- A sword's heavier and way slower to swing.

878
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:46,170
Scott: I'm just really curious.

879
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:53,769
Scott: What if someone made a fighting game where literally like every single, any press whatsoever would cancel anything, no matter what.

880
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,029
Rym: So you could react- So they would be all jabs?

881
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,705
Scott: No, you could just react to everything, right?

882
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,330
Scott: And it would basically be like this really fast rock, paper, scissors until someone was too slow.

883
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:06,510
Scott: Because you'd be like, you see a rock coming, the rock takes three frames.

884
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:12,669
Rym: I'm reading a thing here about King of Fighters 13 and it's saying something about how everything's fully cancelable.

885
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:14,830
Rym: I've never played King of Fighters.

886
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:15,888
Scott: I was never- I don't know either.

887
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,370
Rym: King of Fighters is so outside of fighting games I care about.

888
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:18,910
Rym: I know nothing.

889
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,950
Scott: We're like talking about fighting games you know nothing about.

890
00:44:21,511 --> 00:44:25,630
Rym: Here's my order of fighting games that I actually know enough about to be able to play.

891
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:26,084
Rym: Okay.

892
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,510
Rym: The top of that list is still Soul Calibur.

893
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:30,510
Rym: Soul Calibur 2.

894
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,210
Scott: Not any other Soul Calibur.

895
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,232
Scott: Well I guess I'm really good at Soul Edge and Soul Calibur 1.

896
00:44:34,232 --> 00:44:35,188
Rym: I can play?

897
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,449
Scott: Soul Calibur 2 is the jam.

898
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,210
Rym: I can play newer Soul Calivers?

899
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,170
Rym: I'm just not as good.

900
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:41,943
Scott: I mean I couldn't do any pro stuff at Soul Calibur.

901
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:47,010
Scott: but Soul Calibur is actually a great example of it's a game where things aren't cancelable, right?

902
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,497
Scott: But A, it's kind of slower.

903
00:44:49,677 --> 00:44:53,724
Scott: so as an old person it works better but everything sort of makes sense.

904
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,730
Rym: Yeah, tell me how anything Voldo does makes sense.

905
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:06,290
Scott: But I mean in terms of the animations you see on the screen, the buttons you press, the things that happen, it's like you can understand that you don't really get into situations even when you lose horribly.

906
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:15,626
Scott: Like oh that was both, you know I pressed the button, it didn't, it's like no because you saw you had this big heavy sword in the air slowly moving down and someone kicked you in the gut.

907
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:20,949
Rym: Close normals are the fastest normal attack, faster than a crouching light attack and they're fully cancelable.

908
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:21,827
Scott: Okay.

909
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:27,664
Rym: There's no list of, no one is rated fighting games based on percentage of moves that are cancelable.

910
00:45:28,774 --> 00:45:29,250
Rym: That's the thing.

911
00:45:29,513 --> 00:45:31,029
Rym: Someone get on that.

912
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:36,930
Scott: I mean the fundamental game would be like rock, paper, scissors, but it's not reveal simultaneously.

913
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,270
Scott: It's you have three buttons, rock, paper, and scissors.

914
00:45:39,535 --> 00:45:40,248
Scott: You push one.

915
00:45:41,192 --> 00:45:43,830
Scott: It takes three seconds for that one to execute.

916
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:53,049
Scott: So if you push rock like or not three seconds, but like, you know, three milliseconds or three hundredths of a second, whatever it is, three tenths of a second, I guess is reasonable for a human.

917
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:55,970
Scott: It takes three tens of a second for the rock to execute.

918
00:45:56,631 --> 00:46:02,309
Scott: If somewhere in those three tenths of a second, the other guy presses the paper button, you're going to be in trouble.

919
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:04,150
Rym: But why would you be though?

920
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:07,010
Rym: Because your rock would finish before his paper finished.

921
00:46:07,612 --> 00:46:10,510
Scott: But he's already pressed paper in the time window.

922
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:13,349
Scott: So you're basically, your rock is going to get covered.

923
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:22,030
Rym: All you're saying is that if I, someone doesn't attack at me and then I react to them, my reaction attack is faster now because I'm reacting.

924
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:22,749
Rym: That's what you're saying.

925
00:46:23,234 --> 00:46:23,410
Rym: Yes.

926
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:29,070
Rym: So how you're supposed to, that's how almost every counter system works in fighting games.

927
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:29,471
Scott: Right.

928
00:46:29,531 --> 00:46:34,929
Scott: So then if I see his paper, I have until the time that my rock finishes to push scissor instead.

929
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:35,568
Rym: So you know what?

930
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,082
Rym: You can do two or three changes of that and then humans can't react that fast and that's it.

931
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,109
Rym: The game becomes random.

932
00:46:40,562 --> 00:46:40,730
Scott: Right.

933
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:41,509
Scott: But it would be awesome.

934
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,469
Rym: Why don't we make it and watch what happens.

935
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:46,750
Scott: Basically, I think it would be really interesting if you started it really slowly.

936
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,430
Scott: It's like the first thing you press takes five seconds to land.

937
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:54,090
Scott: And then the next, so the guy's five seconds and then the next one takes like, you know, wait a minute.

938
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:54,607
Rym: All right.

939
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:56,009
Rym: So, so you hit paper.

940
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:56,668
Scott: Yup.

941
00:46:56,871 --> 00:46:58,969
Rym: If I do nothing, can you still change it?

942
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:07,269
Rym: If paper, if you change anything at all hits, if you change it and I've still done nothing is the timer reset?

943
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:09,087
Scott: Yes.

944
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:09,906
Rym: Yes.

945
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:10,769
Rym: All right.

946
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:16,866
Rym: So I will never do anything until the last possible, you hit a button no matter what you hit.

947
00:47:17,074 --> 00:47:17,608
Rym: I'll just wait.

948
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:24,129
Rym: And if it gets with, if you get to like that last millisecond, then I'll counter you because you probably can't physically react that quick.

949
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:31,350
Scott: Maybe what you, I think maybe the way it might've to design it is where every move you do basically starts slow and accelerates.

950
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,470
Scott: It's like, so it's like you have this, it's like every time someone presses a button.

951
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,670
Rym: Starts slow and accelerates is just an animation.

952
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,970
Rym: I would ignore it and count beats instead.

953
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:41,108
Scott: Sure.

954
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,269
Rym: But I mean, so there's no actual acceleration.

955
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:47,410
Scott: It's going to be about, it's, it's sort of like Simon Says, but really fast.

956
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,330
Rym: Here's how I would do it instead.

957
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,009
Rym: It's like it's paper, rock, scissors, right?

958
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,190
Rym: So the, or Simon Says, same thing.

959
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:56,630
Rym: Every time you hit an attack, you can hold any button down.

960
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,808
Rym: You can only hold one down at a time.

961
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:02,405
Rym: If you're holding one down, it's like you've got rock out.

962
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:05,602
Rym: and every time you hit rock, it does say 0.5 damage to the person.

963
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:13,570
Rym: If they're not doing anything, if they are holding rock or hit rock at the same time, then you cancel each other out.

964
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:14,487
Rym: No one's doing any damage.

965
00:48:15,553 --> 00:48:22,190
Rym: And then if you do the attack that breaks someone else's out or simultaneous attack, you do double damage.

966
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:28,569
Scott: So basically you have a set of buttons for switching between rock, paper and scissor, and then one button that actually puts it out there.

967
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,530
Scott: Or it could be out or not out.

968
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,190
Rym: Or I'd say if you hit the button, it goes out and does damage.

969
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:40,110
Rym: If it like it hits and then it stays out doing no more damage, but doing its block.

970
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:40,630
Scott: That's not bad.

971
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,210
Scott: Like rock, paper or scissor, you can switch between them at will with three buttons and there's an attack button.

972
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:49,829
Scott: And if you put the rock paper or scissor out and there's no response to it, it does one point of damage.

973
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:50,149
Scott: All right.

974
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:55,729
Scott: So if the response to it is the is wrong, like if you put out a scissor and they put out a paper, you do like 10 damage.

975
00:48:56,231 --> 00:49:01,188
Scott: If you put out a, you know, and then you have to take like you both put scissor, but it does zero damage.

976
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:08,589
Rym: The only way to make this work is you have to take like triple crazy damage if you attack the thing you're weak against.

977
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:09,368
Rym: Yeah.

978
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,530
Rym: Because otherwise I win by basically mashing my keyboard simultaneously.

979
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:13,701
Scott: Right.

980
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,209
Rym: Anyway, there's your fighting game.

981
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,810
Scott: So more about Smash Brothers.

982
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:20,570
Scott: So let's talk about all the other stuff that's in the Smash Brothers besides Smash Brothers.

983
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,709
Rym: It's a well, it's so it's a great list of characters.

984
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:23,370
Scott: Yeah.

985
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,449
Scott: The character list is incredibly cool.

986
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:26,936
Rym: The I can't.

987
00:49:26,976 --> 00:49:30,389
Scott: I'm having a hard time thinking of characters they didn't put in that I want besides boo.

988
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:32,950
Rym: I was about to say boo or generic Koopa.

989
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,269
Scott: You know, I can't go that deep.

990
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:35,804
Rym: Here's the show.

991
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:36,389
Rym: All right.

992
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:37,570
Rym: You want to know characters.

993
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,210
Scott: It could have been more of zero guys besides Captain Falcon.

994
00:49:40,331 --> 00:49:44,470
Scott: That would have been nice because they have non too many fantasy type people with swords.

995
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:47,230
Rym: I really want to take one of those out.

996
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:48,207
Rym: I want Kaboom guy.

997
00:49:49,336 --> 00:49:49,869
Scott: OK, sure.

998
00:49:50,216 --> 00:49:50,669
Rym: That's the guy.

999
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,047
Scott: That's more of an item than a.

1000
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:52,386
Rym: Yeah.

1001
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,410
Rym: There should be an assist trophy.

1002
00:49:53,696 --> 00:49:53,970
Scott: Right.

1003
00:49:54,752 --> 00:49:55,369
Rym: But I still want him.

1004
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:55,810
Scott: Yeah.

1005
00:49:55,932 --> 00:49:56,569
Scott: I mean, Duck Hunt.

1006
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,669
Scott: Dog is probably the most creative, amazing character.

1007
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:59,949
Rym: Also, fuck Duck Hunt.

1008
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:00,277
Scott: Dog.

1009
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:00,719
Scott: Yeah.

1010
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:02,237
Scott: Yeah.

1011
00:50:02,696 --> 00:50:03,108
Scott: Pretty much.

1012
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,130
Rym: I pretty much play Pete.

1013
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:09,310
Rym: My order is I play Peach Koopa kid and I usually either play Iggy or actual Koopa kid.

1014
00:50:09,512 --> 00:50:10,908
Scott: I like Game and Watch guy.

1015
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:12,548
Rym: Game and Watch is right under that.

1016
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,845
Scott: Pac-Man and Kirby.

1017
00:50:16,253 --> 00:50:18,070
Scott: But Kirby is like the most straightforward to use.

1018
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:21,430
Rym: And Sam is still, of course, he's my spirit animal in every Smash Brothers.

1019
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,589
Rym: Peach has been the character I played most of the time.

1020
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:26,129
Rym: If I if I'm playing for serious, I'm playing Peach.

1021
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:27,387
Scott: Peach got really juiced up.

1022
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,169
Scott: They juiced up Peach big time.

1023
00:50:29,891 --> 00:50:30,147
Rym: Oh, no.

1024
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,528
Rym: Peach has always been pretty juiced.

1025
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:32,987
Scott: Now even more juiced.

1026
00:50:34,815 --> 00:50:36,049
Rym: They actually kind of gimped Falco.

1027
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:36,794
Scott: Yeah.

1028
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:38,410
Scott: Falco is not as good.

1029
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,770
Rym: Falco used to have this like sideways.

1030
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:43,709
Scott: Falco used to be like pro level, but now not, you know.

1031
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:44,241
Rym: Yeah.

1032
00:50:45,892 --> 00:50:48,849
Scott: Anyway, of course, pro players are probably like, what the fuck is wrong with you guys?

1033
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,889
Scott: As far as we're talking about, like how good they are for unskilled people using them.

1034
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,190
Rym: Or like people of our skill, which is one step above or below.

1035
00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:05,467
Scott: The main reason I use Kirby is because Kirby is really easy to use for unskilled people because all his stuff, like he controls normally in like a way you would expect as a normal human being.

1036
00:51:05,741 --> 00:51:05,826
Rym: Yeah.

1037
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,270
Scott: Not strangely like some of the characters like Duck Hunt Dog or whatever.

1038
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:14,849
Rym: But I like some clever stuff like how Koopa Kid's like special up is like his third jump to escape.

1039
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,450
Rym: He just literally throws the machine he's riding down and then it explodes.

1040
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,750
Rym: You don't expect that shit unless you played this game a lot.

1041
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:22,210
Scott: Yeah.

1042
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:24,690
Scott: He hit me with it and I didn't even know that that was the thing.

1043
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:25,070
Rym: Yeah.

1044
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:26,329
Rym: You got to play that game more.

1045
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:27,315
Scott: Yeah.

1046
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:28,239
Rym: Yeah.

1047
00:51:28,512 --> 00:51:29,089
Rym: You already done?

1048
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:36,350
Scott: I mean, I've already played so much of it that it's sort of like, okay, there's no real reason to play it except if it's multiplayer.

1049
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:43,409
Rym: So surprisingly light variety in the number of stages and I actually don't like several of the stages.

1050
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,710
Scott: Some of the stages.

1051
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:45,709
Scott: I'm not into the stages.

1052
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:57,648
Rym: Several of the stages have, they're so dangerous that even among like pretty skilled players, you can win at least if you're playing stock by letting the whole game is don't let the stage kill you.

1053
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:02,728
Scott: I mean, there have always been stages that like move and stuff like that and have dangerous environments in them.

1054
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:04,156
Scott: But in this one, it's like.

1055
00:52:04,196 --> 00:52:09,349
Scott: some of the environments are just so ludicrously dangerous or they scroll so crazy fast or whatever.

1056
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,046
Scott: It's not like, like the most dangerous one used to be the F zero one, which they still have.

1057
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:13,410
Rym: Yeah.

1058
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,470
Scott: Now the rainbow road one's pretty similar.

1059
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,490
Rym: It's actually not dangerous.

1060
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:16,950
Rym: That one.

1061
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,170
Scott: I'm fine with rainbow road.

1062
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,250
Scott: I like rainbow road actually, but I don't like Gerudo village is pretty fucking dangerous.

1063
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,650
Rym: The mega man one is fucking mega man one.

1064
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:28,450
Scott: The yellow devil fills up the entire screen.

1065
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:36,519
Rym: What's funny is because when I was playing with good people at packs, whenever the devil appeared, everyone sorta had this semi truce and they'd all attack the devil to like kill him.

1066
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:42,888
Rym: So we get back to fighting and a few, and I can't like people like if you, if you left an opening, people would obviously attack you.

1067
00:52:43,352 --> 00:52:45,649
Rym: But like there was this unspoken thing that you went after that thing.

1068
00:52:46,355 --> 00:52:47,109
Rym: I don't go after that.

1069
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:48,909
Scott: No, I just try to stay alive.

1070
00:52:50,015 --> 00:52:50,226
Scott: Yeah.

1071
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:54,030
Scott: It's, it's like if Phil, it's a dangerous thing that fills up the entire stage.

1072
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:56,910
Scott: It's very, very hard to do anything about it if you're not pro.

1073
00:52:57,435 --> 00:52:58,170
Scott: It's like just play.

1074
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,650
Scott: You could play single player in that level and it would be hard.

1075
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:06,109
Rym: Well granted, I was hanging out behind him on that tiny ledge and you did your Kirby rock down and tried to hit me there.

1076
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,090
Scott: But there's a tiny ledge.

1077
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:08,570
Scott: I thought the rock was going to land on that ledge.

1078
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,590
Rym: I shielded, so I pushed you a little bit and then you just missed the ledge.

1079
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,109
Scott: I thought the rock goes through the shield.

1080
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:14,630
Rym: No, it doesn't go through the shield.

1081
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:15,409
Scott: That doesn't make sense.

1082
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,348
Rym: What goes through the shield?

1083
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:19,849
Scott: A giant rock that lands directly on top of it.

1084
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:25,349
Scott: At the very least, it should land on top of the shield and sit there going hit, hit, hit, hit, hit until the shield breaks.

1085
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,329
Scott: At least, you know, I just sit on your head as a rock.

1086
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:30,210
Scott: Why should I fall off the side?

1087
00:53:30,372 --> 00:53:31,510
Rym: At that point, why should we even fight?

1088
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:32,729
Rym: Why don't we just walk around and hang out?

1089
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,284
Scott: We should.

1090
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:34,388
Rym: Happy.

1091
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,650
Rym: So yeah, the levels are... I mean, I like a lot of...

1092
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,970
Scott: Wasn't the first Smash Brothers commercial for N64 like the Happy Together song?

1093
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:40,886
Rym: I think so.

1094
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:41,650
Rym: I don't remember.

1095
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:42,880
Rym: That era, I was 100% PC.

1096
00:53:44,737 --> 00:53:44,949
Scott: Okay.

1097
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:46,304
Rym: Like I did not even own an N64.

1098
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:47,890
Scott: I'm talking about the TV commercial.

1099
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,230
Rym: I'm just saying, I didn't watch TV then either.

1100
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:57,750
Rym: I had never played Smash Brothers until RIT because consoles were stupid baby games when I was in high school.

1101
00:53:59,432 --> 00:54:08,429
Rym: Where I lived, who I hung out with, my high school, the cable modems that we got early, it was console baby games and PC.

1102
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,850
Scott: Smash Brothers N64 is not a baby game.

1103
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,390
Rym: Yeah, but consoles were for babies in my high school.

1104
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:14,500
Rym: Sure.

1105
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,110
Rym: You know what the only games people played?

1106
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,870
Rym: They played Smash.

1107
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,370
Rym: I thought it was stupid looking and they played Blitz.

1108
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,890
Rym: That was the only two games they ever played.

1109
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:21,530
Scott: But you did not play any Blitz.

1110
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:21,919
Rym: Yeah.

1111
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,149
Scott: There was no Blitz happening.

1112
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,350
Rym: They'd alternate between Smash and Blitz, Smash and Blitz.

1113
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,170
Scott: There was no Blitz happening where I lived.

1114
00:54:27,694 --> 00:54:29,590
Rym: If we were at a camp, we'd play Goldeneye.

1115
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:29,980
Rym: That was it.

1116
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,530
Rym: Even then, Goldeneye, they showed me Goldeneye.

1117
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,510
Rym: Like, "Oh, let's play Goldeneye.

1118
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:33,910
Rym: Goldeneye.".

1119
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:34,850
Rym: I'd never played a multiplayer.

1120
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:37,310
Rym: They were flipping their shit about how awesome it was.

1121
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,770
Scott: They played Goldeneye because they didn't have cable modems in their neighborhood.

1122
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:40,950
Rym: All I could think was like, "Really?

1123
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,584
Rym: This is like baby's first

1124
00:54:43,725 --> 00:54:44,188
Rym: LAN.".

1125
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:44,619
Scott: Yeah.

1126
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,789
Rym: It's wrong with you kids.

1127
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,188
Scott: People don't have cable modems.

1128
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:47,641
Scott: Yeah.

1129
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,410
Scott: They weren't privileged to live in such a neighborhood.

1130
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:53,950
Rym: Also, I had local LANs and LAN parties and no modems.

1131
00:54:54,573 --> 00:54:54,664
Scott: Yeah.

1132
00:54:54,730 --> 00:55:01,730
Scott: You know how many of my friends had a computer that wasn't just like their parents' computer that they could pick it up and bring it somewhere?

1133
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:06,410
Rym: When I convinced my parents- I was the only one who had a separate- I was like, "I need to buy a thing called a null modem.

1134
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,569
Rym: I'm not even going to try to explain to you what it is, but I need one of

1135
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:09,670
Rym: them.".

1136
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:13,510
Scott: I was the only person who had their own computer that they built themselves.

1137
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,650
Scott: That wasn't until senior year when I had money.

1138
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,520
Scott: Anyway, the rest of the Smash Brothers stuff.

1139
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:24,220
Scott: They got the All-Star mode and the Classic mode.

1140
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,519
Rym: You know what?

1141
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,240
Rym: In GameCube, I never played any of that bullshit ever.

1142
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,119
Rym: Never once played that game single player ever.

1143
00:55:32,424 --> 00:55:35,600
Rym: In the next one that came out, also never.

1144
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,087
Rym: Okay.

1145
00:55:36,873 --> 00:55:37,060
Rym: Never.

1146
00:55:37,363 --> 00:55:39,478
Scott: Never, never, never ever played- You didn't play it in your 3DS?

1147
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:44,300
Rym: 3DS, I only played it until I unlocked all the characters and I never played it again.

1148
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,840
Rym: That Brawl, Smash Run mode, eh.

1149
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:59,760
Scott: Smash Run mode is interesting because it starts out, basically, walk around this big map hitting stuff and getting stuff to power up, and then we're going to put you into an unknown mystery competition.

1150
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,440
Scott: It might be a jumping competition, a race, or a fight.

1151
00:56:03,723 --> 00:56:04,314
Scott: You don't know which one.

1152
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:09,638
Scott: If you did know which one in advance, then you might concentrate on getting the power-ups that would help you with it.

1153
00:56:10,121 --> 00:56:10,999
Scott: Instead, it's a mystery.

1154
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:22,540
Scott: You can't, and the thing is, if you take out the powering up part at the beginning, which is sort of annoying and time consuming, and sort of really determines who's going to win the next one-

1155
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,156
Rym: I've found that it usually does not determine-

1156
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:30,379
Scott: Here's the thing- If you get a bunch of speed boosts and no one else does, and it's a race, you just

1157
00:56:30,439 --> 00:56:30,540
Rym: win.

1158
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,860
Rym: The problem is- Here's the real problem.

1159
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,660
Rym: The race is a bullshit mode.

1160
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:38,300
Rym: I like it, but it's stupid.

1161
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:45,520
Scott: I think that if you had the race, but all you chose was a character- The characters all run at the same speed is really stupid.

1162
00:56:45,621 --> 00:56:48,620
Scott: I played one of those once just where- It's about dodging obstacles and such.

1163
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:49,379
Rym: Yeah, you think that.

1164
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:52,180
Rym: I played it once where by chance- And maneuvering and hitting the other people.

1165
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:54,019
Rym: Three of the players had basically the same speed.

1166
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,400
Rym: Everyone's running at the same speed, dodging all the obstacles basically perfectly.

1167
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:02,740
Rym: If you tried to attack anyone, you just fell behind, then you could never catch up ever.

1168
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,112
Rym: That was it.

1169
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:03,860
Rym: That was it.

1170
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,519
Scott: It has the potential to be more like that game we played at PAX.

1171
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,320
Rym: Which was a good idea, poorly executed.

1172
00:57:11,363 --> 00:57:15,340
Rym: I got all the fun I needed out of that game by playing it at PAX, because it just wasn't.

1173
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,000
Scott: But it's like there's something there.

1174
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:17,617
Rym: There is.

1175
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:19,499
Rym: No one's made that game though.

1176
00:57:20,002 --> 00:57:23,220
Scott: But anyway, so yeah, there's no reason to play Smash Run mode really.

1177
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,939
Rym: I'd like to play it with more humans.

1178
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:32,019
Scott: Because also- I wish that you were in the Smash, the first part with the other characters and not by yourself.

1179
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,419
Rym: Yeah, that would be a lot more fun.

1180
00:57:33,861 --> 00:57:36,780
Scott: Because then I wouldn't- Because then you can go around trying to prevent people from getting power-ups.

1181
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,560
Rym: Yeah, kill some people and knock them down a peg before the real thing.

1182
00:57:39,745 --> 00:57:39,918
Rym: Right.

1183
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,159
Rym: That would be way more fun.

1184
00:57:42,563 --> 00:57:44,580
Scott: The classic mode, it's very strange.

1185
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:50,960
Scott: If I turn the difficulty up to the maximum, the highest possible level- All the way to the hands, and then they kill you.

1186
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:57,900
Scott: I get all the way to the boss without dying, even on the hardest level, which makes me think for someone like me who sucks, what's up with the AI?

1187
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,540
Rym: Because that's always been Smash Brothers.

1188
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,760
Scott: But then the boss is just ridiculously hard.

1189
00:58:04,101 --> 00:58:11,160
Scott: It has all these phases, like tons and tons of phases, all the way up from giant person, two hands, everything.

1190
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:18,000
Scott: So if you play on the hardest difficulty, it starts at the hardest phase, and then you have to beat it every single phase without dying.

1191
00:58:18,222 --> 00:58:20,180
Scott: You only have two lives to beat all those phases.

1192
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:26,959
Scott: So when I get to that, I can only beat the boss starting at like phase five and a half, maybe, and working my way down from there.

1193
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:28,779
Scott: It's really hard.

1194
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:40,740
Scott: It's like you basically have to beat it by dodging tons and tons of attacks that are ridiculously hard to dodge, and then getting in like one pot shot when it's open and repeating that for a very, very long period of time.

1195
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,600
Rym: Oh, like almost every boss fight in every game ever.

1196
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:50,413
Scott: No, I mean, a lot of boss fights that are good boss fights, there'll be like, "Time is when you can get your hits in without getting hit too

1197
00:58:50,453 --> 00:58:50,855
Scott: badly.".

1198
00:58:52,082 --> 00:58:56,280
Scott: Super Metroid would be the difficulty that I'd be looking for in a high quality boss fight.

1199
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:00,620
Scott: It's like, "If you know what you're doing, it's reasonable to beat this boss.

1200
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:03,300
Scott: You're going to take some damage if you mess up a little bit.

1201
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:04,648
Scott: You could die pretty

1202
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:05,152
Scott: easily.".

1203
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:13,279
Scott: The boss fight, and this might be one of the hardest, but if you count the level 10 boss, this might be one of the hardest boss fights ever.

1204
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,540
Scott: I mean, not hardest video games ever.

1205
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:22,218
Scott: It'd probably be easier to beat that than to beat all of Silver Surfer, but maybe one of the hardest boss fights ever in any video game.

1206
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:31,420
Rym: All those modes, I remember watching people hanging out in our apartment at RIT, playing the single player Smash Brothers while we were hanging out, like you're on the GameCube.

1207
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,820
Rym: That shit was boring, not fun, never was.

1208
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,978
Rym: The single player in this game exists, and that's all that needs to be said about it.

1209
00:59:40,986 --> 00:59:41,260
Scott: I don't know.

1210
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,880
Scott: I think there is some fun to be had in the single player.

1211
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:51,279
Scott: Some of the stuff is sort of puzzly, like the baseball home run game has always been kind of puzzly.

1212
00:59:51,440 --> 01:00:00,094
Scott: It's like, "How do I, with this character, do as much damage as possible in a short period of time, and then still have time to use the bat, and also be in the right

1213
01:00:00,154 --> 01:00:00,716
Scott: position?".

1214
01:00:03,123 --> 01:00:05,819
Rym: I do enjoy that one only because it's so quick.

1215
01:00:06,964 --> 01:00:08,659
Scott: Yeah, and it resets really quickly, too.

1216
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,599
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of the other modes are not quick.

1217
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:18,160
Scott: There's a lot of the different games like that, the minigames, there's something to them that is interesting.

1218
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:24,880
Rym: Well, those are how to get good at the game in one sense, in that you need to be able to master how to do the combos and max out the damage on that sandbag.

1219
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:30,739
Scott: Not that a game doesn't teach you this combo, you just sort of have to push buttons until you figure the shit out.

1220
01:00:31,201 --> 01:00:38,440
Rym: I ran into a problem with PAX with the game, because the real reason why I think this game is so important, because I'd say buy it if you care at all about Smash.

1221
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:47,900
Rym: Unless you're in college, or in a place where you will have people physically over with a console, you're not going to get that old Smash Brothers feeling that often.

1222
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:49,460
Scott: Unless you go to a convention or something.

1223
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,297
Rym: You can just start a game of this anywhere with anyone who has a 3DS.

1224
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,699
Rym: Play it a lot of just four player Smash, and two player Smash, just walking around PAX, it was totally awesome.

1225
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:07,379
Rym: However, you can make it on Finale, couldn't play it, because everyone was trying to play it, and the wifi just failed and no one could play it.

1226
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,040
Scott: That's always been true, even since the first DS.

1227
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,299
Rym: Well, GBA solved that with the physical cable option.

1228
01:01:14,262 --> 01:01:16,380
Scott: Yeah, but no one hardly ever used that except us.

1229
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:24,360
Rym: Only we did, for Advance 4 was once or twice, and then some jack off, because they had their worm light plugged into that thing, would bump the worm light and then everything would crash.

1230
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:29,100
Scott: A whole four player game would be ruined by moving one cable, you think they could hot swap the fucking cable, seriously?

1231
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,840
Rym: Yeah, I'm not saying we go back to those days.

1232
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,900
Scott: No, but I mean, why can't they solve this fucking wifi problem?

1233
01:01:36,061 --> 01:01:38,620
Rym: Well, Scott, do you want to know why?

1234
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,560
Rym: It's like signaling technology, just like there's not a lot you can do.

1235
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,740
Scott: But like, you're Nintendo, you have enough money to manufacture all these 3DSs, right?

1236
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:58,279
Scott: So set up a lab, and put in like a hundred radios all in the same room, and then force the radios to form, you know, a hundred, you know, twenty four player games, and keep working on it until all of them work.

1237
01:01:58,862 --> 01:02:00,140
Scott: And then, you're amazing.

1238
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,519
Rym: So one, probably not possible with wifi.

1239
01:02:02,861 --> 01:02:06,220
Scott: Well, I mean, you don't work on some kind of wireless technology that makes it work.

1240
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,640
Rym: Yeah, a lot of those frequencies aren't available worldwide.

1241
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,880
Scott: Listen, there's got to be a solution.

1242
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:15,480
Rym: I've done a lot of research on this stuff recently, because I was thinking about buying that wireless kit.

1243
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:16,980
Scott: There's reasons.

1244
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,700
Scott: I'm not saying it's easy, but you can do it.

1245
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,559
Rym: Also, there was crazy powerful working wifi at all of Paxos.

1246
01:02:23,142 --> 01:02:23,700
Scott: That's amazing.

1247
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:30,780
Rym: Oh my god, like, my T-Mobile like free global data roaming is working great, but I didn't get great cell signal.

1248
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:35,798
Scott: Couldn't everyone use their DS's to connect to that wifi, and then sort of play on that?

1249
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:44,119
Rym: No, because you couldn't click on the "I accept the terms of this bullshit" in the browser on the 3DS, so you couldn't actually get internet on it.

1250
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:46,220
Scott: That sucks.

1251
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:46,840
Rym: Yeah.

1252
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:51,638
Rym: So, and also, if everyone tried to do that, I don't know how much bandwidth it actually had, but.

1253
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,580
Scott: I mean, you could be, I hope it has LAN mode, right?

1254
01:02:54,762 --> 01:02:55,480
Scott: I never tried that.

1255
01:02:55,601 --> 01:02:56,300
Scott: Is that even a thing?

1256
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:56,483
Scott: No.

1257
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:57,444
Scott: Oh.

1258
01:02:58,183 --> 01:02:58,960
Scott: Why don't they do that?

1259
01:02:59,040 --> 01:02:59,719
Rym: Why would they?

1260
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:00,551
Rym: Who would use that?

1261
01:03:00,592 --> 01:03:01,119
Rym: but you and me?

1262
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:07,960
Scott: Because you could have your DS connect to the internet at the same time, but if anyone else was on the same wifi network as you, you could play over that really quickly.

1263
01:03:08,141 --> 01:03:09,718
Rym: No one wants that except us.

1264
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,440
Scott: A lot of people, I think, want that.

1265
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,610
Rym: No one will buy the game.

1266
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:15,340
Rym: who did not already buy the game because of that.

1267
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:15,918
Scott: Obviously.

1268
01:03:17,442 --> 01:03:19,760
Rym: So, that wifi was also a factor, I think.

1269
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:25,659
Rym: So, the only time it failed was the Omegathon finale while we were waiting, and the main events hall is gigantic, so.

1270
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:26,197
Rym: Yep.

1271
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:37,580
Rym: But yeah, before the panel, I connected my laptop to the wifi, edited some slides, put a bunch of big images in, re-downloaded the 30 megabytes of slides, and then did the panel.

1272
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:42,080
Rym: Like, I could not have done that at another convention.

1273
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,080
Scott: Why didn't you have the slides?

1274
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:56,680
Rym: No, because I thought of something and I really wanted to make a change to add a topic after I learned that no one in Australia, apparently, had ever heard overplayed Five Nights at Freddy's, and it was highly relevant to what I was talking about.

1275
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,700
Scott: How did they not hear of this game that was all over the internet?

1276
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:04,519
Rym: Yeah, no one in the room had heard of the game or played it except, like, one dude who I'd talked to earlier about it.

1277
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:04,864
Rym: Wow.

1278
01:04:06,181 --> 01:04:09,153
Rym: So, yeah, I've gotten a lot of emails from people who were like, "Oh my god, that

1279
01:04:09,173 --> 01:04:09,373
Rym: game.".

1280
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:14,020
Scott: Why are people, like, in Australia not on the internet?

1281
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:15,060
Rym: Actually, you'll be happy.

1282
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:21,199
Rym: A lot of people came up to me and thanked us, thanked you and me for learning about Burning Wheel.

1283
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:22,296
Scott: Oh, you're shocking.

1284
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:29,876
Rym: A listener sent me a long and very good question about Burning Wheel that I'm going to answer on the next Tuesday.

1285
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:30,180
Rym: Geek Notes.

1286
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,679
Scott: What question could they possibly ask?

1287
01:04:32,081 --> 01:04:44,600
Rym: The gist of it is basically, in our panels and talks and every time we try to sell people on Burning Wheel, the examples we use are pretty much always examples either from the book, from canned adventures, or, like, it's always the same examples.

1288
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:50,840
Rym: So his question was basically, he's worried that we never use, like, our own personal anecdotes and examples.

1289
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:54,560
Rym: Does the game actually play the way we talk about it?

1290
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,560
Scott: If you play in a one-shot scenario.

1291
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,138
Rym: No, but I'm saying, like, the question's a little more nuanced than that, but that's the gist of it.

1292
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,059
Rym: And it's a really good question that I'll answer next time because I actually want to give a really long answer.

1293
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:05,940
Scott: All right, whatever.

1294
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:07,137
Scott: You made this episode really long.

1295
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,600
Scott: You couldn't fit that in somewhere.

1296
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,458
Rym: No, I could smash.

1297
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:10,719
Rym: And we're back.

1298
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,520
Rym: I'm full of energy.

1299
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:12,999
Rym: I'm hungry, too.

1300
01:05:13,181 --> 01:05:13,820
Rym: It's Smash Brothers.

1301
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,259
Scott: How much can you really say about it?

1302
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:18,300
Rym: If you like Smash Brothers, buy this one and you'll play it a lot.

1303
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:23,020
Scott: If you've never played Smash Brothers, you should go back and play the old Smash Brothers first.

1304
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,479
Rym: Yeah, I would start with the GameCube one.

1305
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,720
Rym: Yeah, well, OK, because I thought you were going to N64.

1306
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:37,420
Scott: No, playing the N64 one is like telling someone who's never played a platform game before to play Mario Brothers and not play Super Mario Brothers.

1307
01:05:38,722 --> 01:05:41,680
Scott: You should play Super Mario Brothers if you've never played a platformer before.

1308
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:46,100
Scott: You should play GameCube Smash Brothers if you've never played a Smash Brothers before.

1309
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:51,160
Rym: But yeah, this game's actually super fun and pretty pro and good set of items.

1310
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,319
Rym: You can turn the items off.

1311
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:57,580
Scott: The Wii U one is going to have eight players simultaneous, which is going to be the ultimate party game.

1312
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,540
Rym: I'm going to play that at other people's houses.

1313
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:00,148
Scott: Yeah.

1314
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,280
Rym: You know where I'm going to play that?

1315
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,738
Rym: You know where we're going to play that the most, I think?

1316
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:03,490
Rym: Killy.

1317
01:06:04,385 --> 01:06:04,535
Scott: Maybe.

1318
01:06:05,601 --> 01:06:06,419
Scott: Do they Wii U there?

1319
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,719
Rym: I'm sure they will.

1320
01:06:08,142 --> 01:06:08,940
Scott: Someone will bring one over?

1321
01:06:09,122 --> 01:06:09,838
Rym: I think they will.

1322
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,058
Rym: And also, you know where else we're probably going to play it?

1323
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:12,999
Rym: Wildman.

1324
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:13,940
Scott: Maybe.

1325
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:14,710
Rym: Thank you.

1326
01:06:17,193 --> 01:06:19,350
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1327
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:24,490
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

1328
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:29,890
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1329
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:32,810
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1330
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:37,570
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1331

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1332
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:45,390
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1333
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:48,529
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1334
01:07:43,964 --> 01:07:45,139
Media: Little black squash balls.

1335
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:48,799
Media: This machine creates little black squash balls.

1336
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:57,040
Media: It brings potato pancakes to the black squash balls.

1337
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:01,099
Media: This is where I make centipedes.

1338
01:08:02,181 --> 01:08:04,737
Media: I sure love to make centipedes.

1339
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:12,599
Media: I turn little black worms into centipedes.

1340
01:08:14,942 --> 01:08:19,819
Media: I turn little black worms into centipedes.

1341
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:21,920
Rym: It's Thursday!

1342
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:22,236
Rym: Nope.

1343
01:08:22,621 --> 01:08:23,080
Scott: No it's not.
