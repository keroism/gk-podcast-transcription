1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,469
Rym: It's Tuesday January 22nd.

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,312
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:16,018
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:20,800
Rym: tonight We talk about one of the classic games of our time Mike Tyson's punch-out.

5
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:30,577
Rym: Let's do this Lolo - it's there.

6
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,180
Scott: What about Lolo?

7
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:33,986
Rym: - Lolo - it's on the VC.

8
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:34,567
Scott: Yeah.

9
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:35,490
Scott: Yeah, how much do you like it?

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,903
Rym: You know, uh, I think a lot of people forgot about Lolo or have never played Lolo.

11
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:42,210
Rym: Lolo is a fantastic puzzle.

12
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:43,508
Rym: Let me clarify that.

13
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:47,154
Rym: Lolo is very difficult but fantastic Puzzle game.

14
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:49,383
Rym: Lolo - is a wonderful puzzle game.

15
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:50,969
Rym: Lolo 3 is garbage.

16
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:56,390
Scott: Yeah, I never played the low lows all the way through and I never really noticed a big difference between them.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,402
Scott: I noticed that I think Lolo 3 had more that timing kind of stuff.

18
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:01,505
Rym: That was the problem.

19
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,190
Rym: Lolo 1 & 2 were logic puzzles.

20
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,300
Rym: It's alright.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,310
Rym: My brain is here.

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,154
Scott: What do I do?

23
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:06,817
Scott: in what order?

24
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:18,550
Rym: and then Lolo 3 you get to a point where it's like, alright I gotta hope that this randomly walking guy walks in front of that Medusa at the right time And I got a bump into him to stop him and then I got a run past while he stopped there.

25
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,810
Rym: And that's the totally different game and completely beside what was fun about Lolo?

26
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,167
Scott: Yeah, I guess the Lolo had the element of.

27
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:40,710
Scott: you know It's a game where like you're on a map and you want you got to open up an exit by pushing stuff around and shooting things and you only have limited ammo and you can get ammo in certain ways and whatnot and You also have to get out of that exit without getting killed and one shot from anything kills you.

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,035
Scott: So, you know you push like things in front of bad guys that shoot at you So they can't hit you and there's

29
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:59,031
Rym: a limited number of bad guys that act in like predefined known ways So that you kind of once you solve all the basic problems Then they take all those pieces together and make more advanced problems like, you know, good game design just great games Yep.

30
00:01:59,473 --> 00:02:01,699
Scott: So did you buy this Lolo 2?

31
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,886
Rym: Not yet just because I haven't I've been playing punch-out.

32
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,210
Scott: I've been playing punch-out.

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,916
Scott: Are you gonna buy Lolo 2?

34
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:07,297
Rym: Maybe.

35
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:07,900
Scott: Maybe.

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,077
Rym: Thing is I'd rather them just release all the Lolo games on the DS In like one cartridge.

37
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:12,701
Scott: That'd be cool.

38
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:25,330
Scott: You know when I had Fresh From the Air Someone found like my old cruddy website where I wrote a thing about Lolo Way back in the 90s and they asked me to like they were making a Lolo clone and they wanted me to make some levels.

39
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,609
Scott: So I just tossed together some like shit levels.

40
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:35,419
Scott: Yeah, and I guess they credited me and they put one whole world of the game is is my Lolo levels Praise Lolo world.

41
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:36,364
Scott: Something like that.

42
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:37,490
Scott: I made some pretty shit levels.

43
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:46,489
Rym: That's what I always thought and I wish they'd bring the Lolo franchise back in a way of imagine if all right I got my DS right some sort of versus Lolo.

44
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:47,928
Scott: How would that work?

45
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:56,524
Rym: well I could either be you know put in a level designer and you have some sort of logic that figures out if levels are doable And constrain it so that you can't do too much with it.

46
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:57,429
Rym: Then you erase each other.

47
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:06,433
Scott: Well, you give each guy the same number of pieces Like you have this many pushing chests and this many bricks and this many Medusas and this many running guys And you know you.

48
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:11,390
Scott: or maybe you have some number of points and you have to buy the pieces of the map with points.

49
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:17,470
Rym: Or maybe you both take turns adding elements to a common map and then the two of you race together toward the goal.

50
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:18,693
Scott: That'll be okay.

51
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:24,070
Rym: something like I just feel like Lolo is not fully explored to explore the possibilities of multiplayer man.

52
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,190
Scott: Well, I think you know in Mario Party is that one minigame we had to push the goombas and then get the hotel goomba.

53
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:38,368
Rym: Yeah, the only problem with that was that one it brings memories of the hotel Mario Yeah, and two it was always the same math like once you know it you just I know.

54
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:43,487
Scott: but I'm saying Yeah, if you had the verses of Lolo sort of like how tell goomba is versus?

55
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:48,006
Rym: they could work out Yeah, or even just Lolo where you both race to beat levels together.

56
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:48,628
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

57
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:49,813
Scott: Yeah All right.

58
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,540
Scott: Also on the virtual console.

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:04:04,550
Scott: They came out with Super Street Fighter 2, which it was really stupid because I was wondering like Way back in the virtual console they released like the shittiest version of Street Fighter 2 like didn't have you know?

60
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:16,249
Scott: like Street Fighter 2 if you everyone realizes they came out with so many versions of Street Fighter 2 is ridiculous and The only ones that were really worth it were Street in the arcade the only one that mattered to me.

61
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:17,737
Scott: Well, there were two that mattered.

62
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:26,190
Scott: there is Street Fighter 2 championship edition Which is the best one for me as far as I'm concerned, but the the sort of ultimate edition was Super Street Fighter 2 turbo.

63
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:30,990
Rym: So, you know, I was indifferent because I pretty much always played guile.

64
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:38,459
Scott: Yeah But on the virtual console they came out with like Street Fighter 2 Crap shit edition and now they came out with.

65
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:45,730
Scott: and now they came out with decently playable edition And I realized something that was like I was gonna buy it, but I really not gonna play it that much.

66
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,750
Scott: So whatever and you know, maybe I'll buy it someday in the distant future.

67
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:51,430
Scott: You know if we like a need a sudden Street Fighter 2 tournament or something.

68
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:58,812
Scott: But on the I've noticed I've been playing punch-out a lot lately and part of that is because I can play it with the normal Wiimote.

69
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:01,560
Scott: I don't have to plug in a controller or use a game.

70
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,890
Rym: Oh, yeah, you need a different controller to play Street Fighter.

71
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:08,310
Scott: I need that extra controller and I realize I want to play games on the virtual console.

72
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,827
Scott: Like I'll be sitting there and I'll look and I have Super Metroid on the virtual console.

73
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:25,670
Rym: I'm like, I want to play point out that All you would have to do is reach into the same basket from which you pulled out the Wiimote and there's already Another controller ready to go and all you have to do is plug it into the Wiimote.

74
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,918
Scott: You're already holding what you don't even have to move I know but that small amount of effort sort of like.

75
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,882
Scott: but punch it's like.

76
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:32,206
Scott: it's not that so.

77
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,499
Rym: so I think the news here Is that Scott is the laziest motherfucker?

78
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,366
Scott: You said it was happening to you also.

79
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:37,667
Scott: Hello.

80
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:38,249
Rym: No, I didn't.

81
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:39,686
Rym: I never said that.

82
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,424
Rym: What game did I want to play other than punch?

83
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:44,690
Scott: I think I think that's part of it.

84
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,270
Scott: Though is that I see punch-out right there next to the Super Metroid.

85
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:50,570
Rym: I think the reason you play punch-out is because punch-out is a superior game.

86
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,975
Scott: No It's because punch.

87
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:54,890
Scott: it's like I could play two equally perfect games.

88
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:59,370
Scott: One of them does not require a small amount of effort of grabbing a an extra remote.

89
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,990
Scott: So I'm gonna play the one that doesn't require the extra remote.

90
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:08,767
Rym: Of course None of this matters because a game I've been looking forward to since before I knew it existed is finally out.

91
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:12,119
Rym: advance wars The real deal days of ruin.

92
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:23,707
Rym: Yeah, pretty much we did a show about advance wars But I you know every now and then there's a game that there's always that one not who just goes crazy about it and like It's every secret and like super beats the game and that was me.

93
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:33,790
Rym: in advance wars I beat like this the normal and the hard campaigns on every advance wars game to ever came out with Any entire war room except for the ones that were in previous advance wars?

94
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,170
Rym: Yeah, look at this way.

95
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:41,049
Rym: I beat with an s-rank every single war room in the entirety of advance wars one and two.

96
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:51,539
Rym: So when advance wars DS came out half them after the same and I didn't bother with them other than to beat ones that were Somewhat hard on the previous game really easily with some of the new characters.

97
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,221
Rym: Yeah.

98
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:52,903
Scott: Yeah.

99
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:53,324
Scott: Yeah.

100
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:57,583
Scott: Yeah, but as a new advance wars There was a release party at the Nintendo World Store.

101
00:06:57,623 --> 00:06:58,327
Scott: We didn't go to that.

102
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:58,810
Scott: We're busy.

103
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:01,680
Rym: I'm so about this game not one.

104
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:13,469
Rym: The main reason I'm so excited about this game is that Advance wars the three games that we got in the US pretty much played it out Like it got to the point where the strategies were known and perfect and there's really nothing you like.

105
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:30,589
Rym: the game boils down very rapidly to nothing and some of the characters were way over balanced and the maps and The game was getting to the point where you couldn't really play it competitively with a lot of people who are really good at it Which is something that happens to most games and I wondered, you know, what are they gonna do?

106
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,850
Rym: They keep adding more CEOs, which is makes the game more and more unbalanced and then this advance wars is basically a reset.

107
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:41,070
Rym: Yes, all new CEOs all new everything the game is gonna be awesome.

108
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:41,412
Rym: I think.

109
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:44,390
Scott: well, we don't know until we get it which is what could be like couple weeks.

110
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,305
Rym: Yeah, I pre-ordered on Amazon stupidly so I have to wait.

111
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,270
Scott: I don't think that's stupidly.

112
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,830
Scott: I mean, you don't have to go to the stupid GameStop and deal with their bullshit.

113
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:55,769
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time I could have just walked to the GameStop near me at work and just bought it.

114
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:58,729
Scott: Yeah, but I mean having the game now is no different than having it.

115
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:12,150
Rym: I think you understand this is this is one of those rare games where once I get it I'm pretty much going to do nothing in my life outside of GeekNights and possible Extracurricular activities until I've beaten everything that there is to beat in this game.

116
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,790
Scott: Yeah, but I mean the game isn't gonna suddenly change in the next two weeks.

117
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:22,849
Rym: It's gonna be the same game now as it's gonna be but I thought there was a Wi-Fi I could play this online with people.

118
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,349
Scott: You can play it online with people two weeks from now.

119
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,002
Rym: Cuz you know now cuz you know how Nintendo Wi-Fi works.

120
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,695
Rym: if you play a game in the first week There's people playing.

121
00:08:30,997 --> 00:08:32,525
Rym: if you try to play a game in the second week.

122
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:33,150
Rym: There's no one left.

123
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,384
Scott: Well, you can only get a plate with your friends anyway, so it doesn't matter.

124
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:37,669
Scott: You don't play with random losers.

125
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:42,443
Rym: Yeah, see I would I'd say oh I really want to have some sort of ladder ranking system.

126
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,549
Rym: play with people online.

127
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,310
Rym: But as we know Nintendo basically took the idea of online gameplay and just fucked it.

128
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,361
Scott: I mean base.

129
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:54,462
Scott: at this point I basically whether a game allows online.

130
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:56,590
Scott: a Nintendo game allows online play or not.

131
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:59,282
Scott: I just it's as if it doesn't exist.

132
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:00,890
Scott: It's like it doesn't even matter.

133
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:02,138
Scott: It's it they.

134
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:03,809
Scott: they have this feature there.

135
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:08,230
Scott: But the feature is so hindered by the friend code bullshit and all the limitations on it.

136
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:11,190
Scott: It's so bad and so painful to work around it.

137
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,756
Scott: It's as if it's not even there.

138
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,743
Scott: they might as well have not put it in.

139
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:15,947
Scott: cuz I don't consider it.

140
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:17,476
Scott: when I'm buying a game I don't use it.

141
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:18,746
Scott: It's just that shitty.

142
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:25,777
Rym: now I can at least conceive of playing this game possibly with my friends via the Wi-Fi because a lot of times I want to play Advance Wars.

143
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:27,890
Rym: Well, I always want to play Advance Wars.

144
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,459
Rym: The thing is no one else ever wants to play Advance Wars because when the front row crew is together We do something other than play Advance Wars.

145
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,203
Rym: We play T&E.

146
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:42,110
Rym: Yep, but Say I'm at home and Pete's at home and Alex is at home and Scott's at home somewhere in the house.

147
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:47,125
Rym: We could play Advance Wars with the Wi-Fi theoretically if it doesn't suck or not work or something.

148
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:52,290
Rym: So we can't and Maybe I can get some inroads and get these people off of the World of Warcraft.

149
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:54,347
Scott: No, I don't think Advance Wars is gonna get.

150
00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:03,235
Rym: The problem there is that I'm pretty sure most of my friends could play Advance Wars with me online and have and continue to play World of Warcraft without skipping a beat.

151
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:08,269
Scott: Yeah, I think the only hope you have a beating World of Warcraft is I don't know something else.

152
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:10,695
Scott: It's not gonna be Advance Wars.

153
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:13,486
Rym: So speaking of World of Warcraft you have news there.

154
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:14,390
Scott: I do have news.

155
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,514
Scott: Oh my god, that was news.

156
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:27,329
Rym: by the way in the World of Warcraft, you know with computers There's always a limit, you know the matrix that's how they beat the things in the end is well There's limits that could what computers can do and you know integers run out and all that business.

157
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:35,015
Rym: You know in the old video games like in Civ 2 or Civ 1 you could edit the text file to give yourself more gold But there was a limit.

158
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,543
Rym: you couldn't get more than that and all that business.

159
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:40,133
Rym: It's the way computers work now World of Warcraft.

160
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:45,669
Rym: apparently you can never have more than two thousand one hundred two thousand two billion.

161
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:56,951
Rym: No 214 thousand seven hundred and forty eight gold pieces 36 silver pieces and 48 copper pieces and you cannot possibly have more gold than that Uh-huh.

162
00:10:57,553 --> 00:11:02,167
Rym: Now the reason for this is of course, they use a signed integer because that's two to the 31 gold.

163
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:05,246
Rym: No one could ever have more.

164
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:06,253
Scott: now Why do they use?

165
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:08,099
Scott: they should use an unsigned integer.

166
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:12,798
Scott: that way you can have twice as much stuff with the same amount of memory Because you're never gonna have negative gold.

167
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,768
Rym: I have two thoughts about that.

168
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:22,840
Rym: one Maybe they thought of the idea of allowing people to go into debt or more likely They just defined in gold and just never look back.

169
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:23,522
Scott: Yeah.

170
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:25,950
Scott: Yeah, I would have done unsigned in gold.

171
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:28,157
Scott: That way you could add twice as much gold as that.

172
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,478
Rym: but of course for people who don't play World of Warcraft You might think 200,000 gold.

173
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,567
Rym: It's not that much because like in the realm or a lot of other MMOs or you know Eve whatever people have millions and billions And billions of whatever.

174
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:45,718
Rym: One gold is actually a lot of money in Wow Like a lot of money like people were talking about.

175
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,441
Rym: Yeah, I've never like.

176
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:47,847
Scott: it's like it's supposed to be in the in D&D.

177
00:11:49,232 --> 00:12:05,669
Rym: You know it is like that in D&D if you're if you don't have like PC class levels if you're just like Peasant four and maybe like I don't know local dude merchant one the old blacksmith You're maybe gonna see like five gold pieces in your entire life.

178
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:11,110
Scott: Meanwhile adventurers have like a thousand of them at level one where they're just like they can get killed in one hit with a sword.

179
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,793
Scott: They're so weak.

180
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:14,584
Scott: It's like what's so special about you get killed in one shot.

181
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:16,130
Scott: Why do you have a thousand gold?

182
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,378
Rym: Especially before third edition where it wasn't like.

183
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:23,510
Rym: oh well you have levels in those gimp classes like four levels of peasant or expert.

184
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:30,093
Rym: But in the old D&D if you didn't have player class levels you were a level zero commoner And it wasn't like.

185
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:31,739
Rym: oh well you'll level up in commoner.

186
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,224
Rym: No you can't level.

187
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:36,007
Rym: There's no such thing as experience for you It's not for you.

188
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,081
Scott: See what I really like to do is see it's.

189
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:43,990
Scott: I think that Maybe you should get like five NPC levels and then a real class level.

190
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:44,451
Scott: You know.

191
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:50,230
Scott: so like you know I was a blacksmith, and then I became a wizard, but now my blacksmithing skills disappear somehow.

192
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:51,478
Scott: What's up with that?

193
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:53,170
Rym: cuz blacksmithing is worthless?

194
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,694
Scott: What are you talking about?

195
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:57,307
Rym: it costs like a couple gold to buy a sword add?

196
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:59,860
Rym: 300. to that you get a master work.

197
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,769
Rym: the best a human can do without magic.

198
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:04,880
Scott: But I can craft a sword instead with magic myself.

199
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,645
Rym: It's easier to just spend 300 gold.

200
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:06,766
Rym: right.

201
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:09,817
Rym: My favorite thing to do in D&D.

202
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:12,930
Rym: you know D&D especially if you're playing it kind of here in pretzels ease.

203
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:14,534
Rym: You're an adventurer.

204
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:16,380
Rym: I got my thousands and thousands of gold.

205
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:18,990
Rym: whenever you're bribing some commoner just drop a platinum.

206
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:25,738
Rym: that's the equivalent of going to some dive bar in like Bolivia and Finding say making fun of Bolivia.

207
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,990
Rym: I find some dive bar in Botswana.

208
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:29,176
Scott: I make it fun of Botswana.

209
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:44,015
Rym: some dive bar in Albion all right and Dropping you know just walk it up saying hey I need some information on where fat Tony is and then given the guy a cashier's check for ten billion dollars Something like that.

210
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,049
Scott: all right that's that's your news there.

211
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,913
Rym: That's all I got.

212
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,283
Scott: some loser got so much gold in World of Warcraft.

213
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:51,250
Scott: He he discovered the size of a 32.

214
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,190
Rym: I'm assuming that is not in fact some loser who spent every waking hour playing, but someone who was smart enough to game the system.

215
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:01,250
Scott: Well what they could have done is they could have said hey, I wonder if there's a limit on gold.

216
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:04,710
Scott: Everyone give me all your gold and make a bunch of people all gave their you know.

217
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,650
Rym: If that's the case then that person is the most brilliant scammer to ever scam scams.

218
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:11,026
Scott: Or maybe there's a gold farmer or something.

219
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:11,369
Scott: I don't know.

220
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:12,475
Rym: Maybe there's.

221
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:15,289
Scott: maybe someone just bought gold from gold farmers to get to the limit.

222
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,557
Rym: You know how much money that would cost.

223
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:20,606
Scott: good God a lot more than well less.

224
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:30,248
Scott: Hopefully less than two to the 32 Money dollars, okay, okay, so Brazil a country where there are many good and many bad thing.

225
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:31,110
Scott: It's very weird.

226
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,496
Scott: It's like in the US.

227
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:46,609
Scott: all we do is bitch and bitch and bitch, but we have some good things here But all we notice are the bad things and we always look at other countries and say all those other countries are so much better But every one of those other countries is like so much better in all these ways And it's so much worse than a whole different set of ways.

228
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:51,890
Scott: And it's always interesting to see which countries have what is really good there, and what's really bad there.

229
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,884
Rym: I'm really curious where you're going with this.

230
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:56,199
Scott: well in Brazil They have a lot of really good things.

231
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,970
Scott: for example Creative Commons is huge.

232
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,878
Scott: Like they're like what is?

233
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:07,722
Scott: he's the culture minister of Brazil is like a famous Brazilian pop star Who's also a super creative comments and awesome, and they're there.

234
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:08,747
Rym: wait a minute wait a minute.

235
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:12,378
Rym: so so Okay, but the previous part of that.

236
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:13,802
Rym: He was a famous pop star now.

237
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:16,810
Rym: He's a important government minister the culture minister.

238
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,216
Rym: Yeah, I guess that works.

239
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:18,818
Scott: It makes sense.

240
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,204
Rym: Yeah, I guess it kind of makes sense right.

241
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:21,650
Scott: so they're big creative comments.

242
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,477
Scott: There's Linux action going on there.

243
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:25,223
Scott: There's there's all sorts of all.

244
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:27,050
Scott: they use the or cut big time down there.

245
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,420
Rym: I know they use the down there.

246
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:31,509
Rym: That's the reason I don't use the or cut.

247
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:37,750
Scott: yeah I like the or cut right, but you know Brazil's pretty cool, but part of Brazil not so cool.

248
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:39,118
Scott: They just banned.

249
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:39,681
Scott: get this.

250
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:40,888
Scott: this is so ironic.

251
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:46,635
Scott: They banned some video games counter specifically Counter-strike and EverQuest.

252
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:48,221
Scott: these two games are no longer first.

253
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,610
Rym: does anyone still play EverQuest?

254
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,978
Scott: I guess Brazil.

255
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:52,983
Scott: I mean Brazil.

256
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:55,474
Scott: I read a thing a while ago So I don't know how true this still is.

257
00:15:55,534 --> 00:16:03,650
Scott: but in Brazil like when we were playing like ps2 and Xbox and one and in those days Brazil was like all about Sega Genesis.

258
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:12,060
Rym: Well, I've read that pretty much in most of South America at the SNES Genesis era of video gaming is huge for a variety of reasons We don't need to really get into.

259
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,069
Scott: I mean you don't realize it.

260
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:25,767
Scott: But like Sega is like way huge around the world outside You know the US and such outside the US and Japan for like like they're building like Sega Amusement parks in places around the world, you know, like huge Sonic the Hedgehog huge.

261
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:32,470
Rym: Well, I mean think Sega did a lot better in like the UK in South America when it came out than it ever did in the US.

262
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:35,630
Scott: Yeah, I mean when I was ten age-wise, I guess not absolutely.

263
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,992
Scott: I mean when I went to when I went to Israel in the year 2000 right.

264
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:43,689
Scott: the every arcade that we saw was a Sega arcade and all the tokens had Sonic on them.

265
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:53,380
Scott: and When I went to a this dude's house, he had a master system and I was like, whoa The master system that was so that was a generally worth this piece.

266
00:16:53,681 --> 00:17:03,080
Scott: So they're you know, they're generally I I you know, I think they're playing older video games in that part of the world You know, so banning counter-strike in EverQuest is not you know, I guess those are popular there.

267
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:04,710
Rym: But I guess I mean I still.

268
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,260
Rym: I can't imagine anyone's playing EverQuest.

269
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:14,830
Scott: but the ban was ordered in October o7 by a federal Brazilian court federal court and But they implementing it now they're taking those games off the shelf.

270
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:16,256
Rym: So so one why did like?

271
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:16,938
Rym: what was the reason?

272
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:18,488
Scott: well Okay, you're ready for this.

273
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:19,556
Scott: This is the greatest part.

274
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:20,000
Scott: You ready?

275
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,614
Scott: Um, let me try to find the exact quote from the judge.

276
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:25,819
Rym: I'm waiting for something epic here.

277
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,270
Rym: I'm waiting for some sort of just the judge Carlos Alberto.

278
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:40,360
Scott: Simoes ruled that the games encouraged quote The subversion of public order were an attack against the Democratic state and the law and the law and against public security.

279
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,676
Scott: No, no EverQuest EverQuest.

280
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:49,619
Scott: How does that follow?

281
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:52,248
Scott: Right, here's the thing that counter-strike.

282
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:59,815
Rym: I could kind of understand even though I look you could look at it from the other perspective Of yeah, but half the players are counter terrorists fighting for justice.

283
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:01,000
Rym: They're on your side, right?

284
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,000
Scott: They also said they incite violence and are harmful to consumers health.

285
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:10,299
Scott: now the thing that really gets me about this is he says we're an attack against the Democratic state.

286
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,440
Scott: I Think censorship is an attack against the Democratic state.

287
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:21,617
Rym: I also find it interesting that they didn't ban first-person shooters or violent video games or MMOs.

288
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:25,074
Rym: They banned two Very specific game.

289
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:25,537
Scott: That's the thing.

290
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:26,060
Scott: They're really good.

291
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,561
Scott: I mean they.

292
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:33,020
Rym: EverQuest - I'm okay if I play Asher ons call and I'm apparently also mentally damaged.

293
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:33,865
Rym: It's okay.

294
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:41,420
Scott: Yeah, I guess it's okay to play World of Warcraft So I can play counter-strike source, okay to play Call of Duty, but it's not okay to play counter-strike.

295
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,465
Scott: I'll play counter-strike source.

296
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:43,471
Scott: I know game.

297
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:45,160
Scott: Oh, I guess I can play.

298
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:49,880
Scott: You know NS or insurgency or any of those besides, you know, what if they're playing old games?

299
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,188
Rym: I'm sure they're all still playing action quake - which is arguably the best game ever to include an mp5 Navy, but I think it's.

300
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,608
Scott: it really shows just a lack of understanding.

301
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:03,007
Scott: knowledge foresight The problem of the legal system.

302
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:07,380
Scott: not understanding technology in the modern world is not exclusive to the United States of America.

303
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,288
Rym: Anyway things of the day.

304
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,300
Rym: now the wiimote can do all these interesting things.

305
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,980
Rym: And I still think the power of the gesture based wiimote whatever has not even been close to have been tapped.

306
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:33,360
Rym: I mean now a lot of the games that have come out and tried to use it have just done it horribly and Just crapily but at the same time games have come out that has shown that there's a lot of potential.

307
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:40,274
Scott: Yeah, much like Apple Nintendo creates products capable of a B C D and E But only create software to do a B and C.

308
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:45,219
Rym: and much like Apple Nintendo doesn't care what you want because Nintendo can laugh all the way to the bank.

309
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:53,743
Rym: Yep, but this dude, I'm not gonna go through all the details because the interesting part is watching this video, but Messing with.

310
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:55,549
Rym: you know the gesture based stuff and whatever.

311
00:19:55,569 --> 00:20:00,404
Rym: you set up a camera thing computer whatever and it's entitled Hand-guided Mario.

312
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:02,249
Rym: This is what the power glove should have been.

313
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:06,560
Rym: now what he has made is not a good game by any stretch.

314
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,477
Rym: It might be fun to play something like this once but this would not be a good game.

315
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:14,225
Rym: It is not polished It doesn't work really.

316
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:19,320
Scott: this is a this is a novelty and a a cool sort of like proof of concept.

317
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:27,120
Scott: But it's you know in terms of technology It's not something you would actually play for fun for awesome, but basically watch the first half and you think oh, that's a good idea.

318
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:30,300
Rym: It's as good of an idea as like Kirby's Canvas curse.

319
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:33,940
Rym: I'd love to see someone take that idea and make a really polished game with it.

320
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,599
Scott: Okay, I think Kirby's Canvas curse is a better game than that.

321
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:45,160
Scott: Oh, but the idea like the how they should make a sequel to the frickin Canvas curse got to make it on the Wii They should make they should make a DS sequel and on the Wii.

322
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,275
Rym: But I'm just talking about like the idea of a platformer where you control characters.

323
00:20:49,316 --> 00:21:00,320
Rym: something like this is pretty cool and I think it's a solid idea, but Keep watching after you think oh I get this because after he beats that the second half of the video is basically alright.

324
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,116
Rym: I've got this idea, and I showed you what I was thinking about it.

325
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,776
Rym: now I'm gonna do something crazy and silly just for fun, and it's pretty crazy and silly.

326
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:14,000
Scott: yeah, it's good stuff Alright, so you know when you go to the craft store There's that whole section of the craft store.

327
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,382
Scott: This is well.

328
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:17,800
Scott: first of all the most popular part of the craft store nowadays seems to be the scrapbooking.

329
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,214
Scott: I don't know what the hell's up with those people.

330
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:19,497
Scott: all right.

331
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:26,606
Scott: But the other second most popular part of the craft store is I guess it's a tie between the cake Decorating and the flower arranging.

332
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:30,540
Rym: right I think flower arranging is a lot more space at most craft stores.

333
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,510
Scott: Yeah, well, I think that's just cuz it takes more space.

334
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,540
Scott: You know the cake decorating is smaller bits.

335
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,751
Rym: Well it also depends on what craft store you go to.

336
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,520
Scott: that's true different craft stores at different stuff.

337
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,992
Rym: but I mean regardless there wasn't so much cake decorating at the Pirates booty.

338
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:45,722
Scott: no, but you know the the Pirates booty.

339
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:48,436
Scott: remember that craft store that was called the Treasure Island.

340
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,118
Scott: Oh, yeah, yeah I don't know where I thought pirates booty right, but anyway.

341
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:52,460
Rym: I've store.

342
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,668
Rym: We didn't know it was a craft store.

343
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,620
Scott: They did have cake decorating them, but not a lot.

344
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,127
Scott: Yeah, there's a store called Treasure Island.

345
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,252
Scott: We're like what the hell's that story.

346
00:21:58,292 --> 00:21:59,015
Scott: final pass.

347
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:00,020
Scott: We finally went to it.

348
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:00,945
Scott: It was a craft store.

349
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:03,620
Rym: Yeah, we I don't know what I was expecting some sort of amusement.

350
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:06,167
Scott: Too many craft stores you have like three.

351
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:13,120
Rym: yeah, it's something so that well that one's gone now right, but the Cake decorating is pretty popular.

352
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:18,720
Scott: And you know cake decorating is not is mostly for old ladies except for when you make nerdy cakes.

353
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:20,687
Rym: It's not the way it goes with everything.

354
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:31,566
Scott: I mean yes knitting old ladies unless you knit a blooper head exactly, so The here are some of the best cake decorating I've seen and it is cupcakes.

355
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:39,360
Scott: actually and it's an array of cupcakes that when you put them together One of them makes a Mario scene and these are his pictures and the other one makes a pac-man scene.

356
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,720
Scott: And you know I mean okay deck cake decorating a scene of a pac-man.

357
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:50,060
Scott: You know that's cool little ghosties little little pellets little you know map little power pellets a little pac-man, right?

358
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,672
Scott: Yeah, it's not really that exciting, but the quality of this cake decorating.

359
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:55,775
Scott: This is like expert.

360
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:56,035
Scott: Well.

361
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:57,700
Scott: It's not expert cake decorating.

362
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,160
Scott: I've seen professional cake decorators make crazy shit.

363
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:10,493
Scott: That'll just blow your mind, but this is you know as good as it gets without being professional And it's it's really just the level of detail that goes into this is the highest quality.

364
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:12,580
Rym: and to speak for how I guess.

365
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:14,872
Rym: Good, this is I did see it.

366
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:19,640
Rym: You know today and Scott told me about yeah I've already seen that and I didn't see it on some nerdy blog.

367
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:26,236
Rym: I didn't see it and like whatever Scott found it on I saw it on Google News while I was looking for something unrelated.

368
00:23:26,377 --> 00:23:26,838
Scott: Are you sure?

369
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:26,919
Scott: yes?

370
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,431
Rym: I'm absolutely sure there was a link to it on Google News.

371
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:31,655
Scott: Wow cuz it was just.

372
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:33,180
Scott: it was just flicker galleries.

373
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:34,183
Rym: Yeah, granted.

374
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:39,798
Rym: That's not saying a lot because Google News links to a lot of interesting news sources, but I did find that.

375
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,744
Scott: yeah So check these out.

376
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:47,848
Rym: you will be impressed if you like Mario or pac-man, but yeah, I think on that note We have something much more important to talk about.

377
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:53,514
Rym: so we've been doing gig nights for years now And I can't believe we never thought to talk about this.

378
00:23:54,197 --> 00:24:01,560
Scott: well It it's sort of rough because what's the real point of like reviewing something so old?

379
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,801
Scott: I mean I can tell you very clearly I think what it is is that you know It's.

380
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:16,400
Scott: it's tough to think to review or talk about something if it's to the point where if you don't know everything that we're already Going to say in this episode then how the fuck you a listener.

381
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,488
Scott: It's like you're not even someone I would look at.

382
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,415
Scott: well then again like an unlookable.

383
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:21,740
Rym: there are different.

384
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:28,899
Rym: I mean I think we'll get to it but you can definitely tell what a video game era someone was from by what they might remember about this game.

385
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:34,419
Rym: because There is one era of video gamers who remember this game is that game that used to have Mike Tyson in it.

386
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:41,440
Rym: And there's another era of video gamers who say yeah, that's that remake of the other game, and then there's the era of video gamers.

387
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,746
Rym: So yeah, that's that game.

388
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:45,599
Rym: That was the only one ever to use the MMC to memory manager.

389
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:53,100
Scott: I was waiting to see how long in the episode would take for Rym to bring up his favorite piece of obscure Nintendo knowledge.

390
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,103
Rym: it's not obscure.

391
00:24:54,124 --> 00:25:12,939
Rym: pretty much everyone from our generation knew if they subscribed to Nintendo power because Nintendo power one day had an article and they were like History of the Nintendo and how the Nintendo worked and had a page that showed what the Nintendo is capable of Before the MMCs the memory manager chips.

392
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,780
Scott: Yep, think about think about all the Nintendo Entertainment System games out there.

393
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,165
Scott: Oh, I'm gonna introduce the game now.

394
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:23,219
Scott: watch this all right all the Nintendo Entertainment System games you could think of.

395
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:30,320
Scott: right Now a lot of what a Nintendo game is is actually in the cartridge more than it is in the system itself.

396
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:36,909
Scott: Right because look at like the Super Nintendo was the same way Star Fox had the FX chip You know and even the Sega Genesis was the same way.

397
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:42,048
Scott: We're like Virtua Racing had this big cartridge on it Because you could do a lot more in the cartridge.

398
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:46,164
Scott: you could get more out of the game system by putting more chips in the cartridge.

399
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:59,020
Scott: so in The olden days all the cartridges use the same chip and you got games like Super Mario Brothers Duck Hunt ice hockey right sort of low resolution not very big games.

400
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:04,897
Scott: You know I mean some games really pushed it like Metroid really put Metroid using MMC.

401
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:05,439
Scott: Oh did it?

402
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:08,433
Rym: yes Okay, then let me put it.

403
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:09,559
Rym: I'll put it in much more.

404
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:20,949
Rym: These 7800 the Atari 7800 came out after the Famicom.

405
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:38,040
Rym: the NES came out After they were similarly powered the rip the reason the NES was capable of doing Mario 3 Eventually with the MMC 3. well basically the NES could address very little memory so you could have very very small games.

406
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,351
Rym: That was it so in these cartridges.

407
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:42,060
Rym: They were clever, and they said wait a minute.

408
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:47,640
Rym: What if I had a chip in each cartridge that would manage the memory for me?

409
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,399
Scott: So better than you know the other cartridge is good.

410
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:53,756
Rym: So say I can like right now to say the cartridge can hold 16 bits.

411
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,937
Rym: That's gonna be a shitty game, but my cartridge has 16 bits.

412
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:00,759
Rym: I can only access 16 bits of stuff.

413
00:27:01,582 --> 00:27:06,298
Rym: So that the whole letter A and the letter B the whole game has to be in that 16 bits.

414
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:07,937
Scott: So there ain't letter B.

415
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:13,658
Rym: But what if my computer can only access 16 bits, but I have those bits?

416
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:30,426
Rym: instead access a chip and that chip accesses hundreds of bits and it swaps through Sets of those bits in 16-bit increments and feeds into the Nintendo Via that 16-bit bus or that 16-bit interface What it can.

417
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:33,440
Rym: so you can have a much bigger game coming through that little interface?

418
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:41,801
Scott: Yep So games like I guess Metroid and others Mario 2 right and so pretty much every game anyone remembers from the NES used a memory Manager.

419
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:42,383
Scott: right, but they were.

420
00:27:42,403 --> 00:27:48,502
Scott: those are games using the MMC one games like Kirby's Adventure and games like Mario 3.

421
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:51,942
Scott: We're using the MMC 3 the most superior chip Don't?

422
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:57,043
Rym: I don't think you want to get into the the talk of which game used which because there's a bunch of Surprises in there.

423
00:27:57,224 --> 00:28:02,640
Scott: I know I know but there was only one game to use the MMC to the MMC.

424
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:10,213
Rym: The thing is that the MMC chips each one had different capabilities And if you remember that Nintendo Power article Then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

425
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:18,078
Scott: some of you might even remember Exactly which chips could do what and there are articles on the internet that explain this in much greater detail than we're going to because We want to talk about this game.

426
00:28:18,561 --> 00:28:30,772
Rym: But the thing is basically the MMC 2 is the punch-out chip because it the way it allowed you to have sprites on the screen And the way it allowed you to do things Was exactly what they needed to make a game like punch-out.

427
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:32,600
Rym: That's why punch-out is so great.

428
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,916
Scott: I mean look at punch-out look how different it is from every other NES game.

429
00:28:36,177 --> 00:28:50,432
Scott: the characters They're so big and they have lots of different parts to their gigantic sprites with lots of you know not necessarily high resolution, you know, but high quality and Varying and very quickly animated sprites.

430
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:52,800
Rym: There's a lot of stuff moving on the screen.

431
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,808
Rym: I mean the audience is moving in the background.

432
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:57,940
Rym: Mario can come out little mags jumping up and down.

433
00:28:58,222 --> 00:29:07,711
Rym: There's also the bar at the top with you know the score and the status and the health and everything you can wipe screens to the the other shots in the between the periods or the rounds.

434
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:23,367
Scott: you got the bicycle action you got the Anyway Yeah, and that was only possible with the MMC 2. and really though the MMC 2 wasn't too useful for if you weren't making a Game that was kind of like that.

435
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,900
Rym: Well, there are other reasons why it wasn't used more widely.

436
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,213
Scott: But yeah, no, they didn't make punch-out to like they should have for the NES.

437
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,923
Rym: Suffice to say the The.

438
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:37,360
Rym: if you didn't know that that this is kind of one of those pieces of trivia that every Nintendo fanboy knows.

439
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:40,840
Rym: So yep now you can stand tall stand proud and say yes.

440
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,140
Rym: Why did you know dear friends that Mike Tyson's punch-out was the only game ever to use the MMC 2 chip in the Nintendo?

441
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,925
Rym: Entertainment system lovely bloody blur.

442
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:53,380
Rym: and they'll either say well, yes, obviously, you're one of us or they'll say what?

443
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:56,179
Scott: What what the so?

444
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,467
Scott: Mike Tyson's punch-out greatest boxing game ever.

445
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,370
Scott: No question.

446
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:01,915
Rym: Mike Tyson's punch-out.

447
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:08,133
Rym: I mean I For this game as such nostalgic value for me an independent of that.

448
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,116
Scott: It's still good.

449
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:09,918
Scott: Great game.

450
00:30:09,998 --> 00:30:10,720
Scott: It's still good.

451
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:16,513
Rym: I mean if you take a kid today and have him play it They'll probably enjoy it a lot probably a lot more than any other boxing game out there.

452
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,020
Rym: Yeah, Aki for the Sega.

453
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:29,538
Scott: But I mean even like brand new boxing games that they're coming out with today that are super realistic in 3d They're all suck their complete shit compared in the face of Mike Tyson's punch-out.

454
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:34,533
Rym: now Very briefly Mike Tyson's punch-out is a game where you're a little Mac.

455
00:30:34,854 --> 00:30:36,780
Rym: little Mac is apparently three feet tall.

456
00:30:37,022 --> 00:30:38,293
Scott: Well, he's not three feet tall.

457
00:30:38,313 --> 00:30:39,060
Scott: He's normal height.

458
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:47,150
Rym: So you're your little Mac and you're like five feet tall and You want to become the heavyweight boxing champion of the world and

459
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:48,033
Scott: you train really

460
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:52,045
Rym: hard and it turns out that every other boxer in The world is 12 feet tall

461
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:56,880
Scott: even the shittiest boxer in all of boxing who is only he was never even won.

462
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,613
Scott: Or maybe one once glass Joe from France.

463
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:00,980
Scott: last Joe from France.

464
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:04,048
Scott: Even though he's a wuss and he's like old and weak.

465
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,435
Scott: He's still like twice your size.

466
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:14,793
Scott: Maybe three and a half times your size And he's the first guy And you got to beat him up without getting your shit kicked out of you.

467
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:28,318
Rym: The game was just so perfectly put together and gameplay aside the I think what really makes this game stand out is just the charm and the style and how each character is.

468
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:29,810
Rym: just so I mean racist.

469
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:39,220
Rym: maybe You cannot help but look at soda Popinski and sing that think damn there's a man who likes his soda.

470
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:43,059
Scott: There's a man from Russia.

471
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,084
Scott: That's what I think.

472
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:46,873
Rym: I think in the original arcade game.

473
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:58,618
Rym: He was he was not so much the soda He was about something else some Beverage that perhaps Nintendo was not too keen on promoting the Vodak Right, but his head is shaped like a bottle of soda pop.

474
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,833
Scott: so Anyway, the game is great basically for two reasons.

475
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:06,120
Scott: You only need well, I guess the music is great, right?

476
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:07,278
Scott: That's a good reason.

477
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:09,767
Scott: The controls are dead on.

478
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,426
Scott: I guess, you know, I had a little problem with dodging when I was a kid But I don't know.

479
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:14,559
Scott: I don't have any problem with it now.

480
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,315
Rym: So I guess that was just like ten times better at this game now than I was as a kid.

481
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:23,340
Scott: Yes for sure But basically the gameplay itself was great.

482
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,771
Scott: You had both the offense and the defense.

483
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,960
Scott: you had to both dodge the opponent, right?

484
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,900
Scott: You had to but you also had to hit the opponent and you know, the hitting was fun.

485
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:34,720
Scott: The dodging was fun, but it was very simple.

486
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:43,651
Scott: you only had five moves jump up hit high with the left high with the right low with the left low with the right and The super attack which is press start which is.

487
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:45,600
Scott: it was sort of annoying to have to push start.

488
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:47,759
Scott: They should have had it be like a and B at the same time.

489
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,140
Scott: I think start it's nice it works just fine, but it could be a little bit.

490
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:52,694
Rym: I think that was a limitation of the.

491
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:57,400
Rym: I mean remember Part of the revolution of the Super Nintendo was that they added some goddamn buttons.

492
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:58,368
Scott: They sure did.

493
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:05,560
Scott: they sure did but yeah The other moves you had were like dodge left dodge right duck and block and that was it.

494
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:12,857
Scott: There's so few moves in this game and your opponents each opponent had crazy different moves and they do all sorts of weird stuff.

495
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:29,739
Scott: and really the gameplay is just learning the patterns of the enemies and then figuring out what you had to do to defeat those patterns and then Looking for the visual cues and perhaps audio cues as to what you know pattern move They were going to start doing so you would be able to counter it.

496
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:37,453
Scott: And then the other half of the gameplay is push the buttons fast enough because like you fight piston Honda And he's pretty dangerous.

497
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:50,826
Scott: if you suck You fight him again, and he does mostly the same moves changes them up a little bit But he's twice as fast and it's twice as hard because you might know the pattern, but you don't push the button fast enough He's gonna make you right in the face.

498
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:57,787
Rym: Okay, so uh soda Popinski's original name from the 1985 punch-out arcade game.

499
00:33:57,807 --> 00:33:58,409
Rym: you know what it was.

500
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:00,093
Rym: you want to know what it was what it's?

501
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:04,316
Rym: uh, it's kind of epic all right vodka drunkenski?

502
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,510
Scott: Yeah, you know Mike Tyson's punch-out.

503
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,505
Scott: vodka drunkenski.

504
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:21,646
Rym: I'm not making this up.

505
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:27,201
Scott: Mike Tyson's punch-out for the NES is the game that everyone has nostalgia for.

506
00:34:27,262 --> 00:34:33,270
Scott: but there was a punch-out a plain old non Mike Tyson punch-out that came out in the arcades before that and I've seen this machine.

507
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:38,253
Scott: I've never actually played the machine because I've never seen a working one or one that was working well enough But it was.

508
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:40,551
Scott: it's a very strange machine I don't know.

509
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:45,050
Scott: maybe we can find a picture of it online or something, but it's not like other arcade machines.

510
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:52,429
Scott: I don't know how well it plays but Apparently it still had the charm of the racist stereotype characters from around the world.

511
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:57,014
Rym: Oh, yeah Well, there's see there were actually two of them 1984 1985.

512
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:59,944
Rym: The characters in Mike Tyson's punch-out and mr.

513
00:34:59,985 --> 00:35:01,089
Rym: Dream can die in a fire.

514
00:35:01,552 --> 00:35:04,997
Rym: Yeah We're drawn from both of these.

515
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:10,714
Rym: punch-out in 1984 had glass Joe piston hurricane bald bull Pizza pasta.

516
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,204
Scott: Oh, I want to fight pizza pasta kid quick.

517
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,207
Rym: and mr.

518
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:16,070
Rym: Sandman.

519
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:16,775
Scott: Mr.

520
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,610
Scott: Sandman is a fucking dangerous motherfucker.

521
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,674
Scott: He will put you out.

522
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:29,970
Rym: and the 1985 one had bear hugger dragon-chan or dragon-chan Who is actually Bruce Lee and apparently is a kickbox bear huggers the second guy in super punch-out, which we'll talk about sooner.

523
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,659
Rym: No, well, this is super punch-out the arcade game.

524
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,481
Scott: Oh, okay.

525
00:35:33,602 --> 00:35:39,430
Rym: Okay vodka junkins key Grey tiger and super macho.

526
00:35:39,731 --> 00:35:44,634
Scott: I played super punch-out in the arcade and it was pretty much identical of the Super Nintendo one But it was the arcade.

527
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:47,226
Scott: so that must have been a much like a 90s super punch-out.

528
00:35:47,226 --> 00:35:50,483
Rym: 1985 When this was come this came out.

529
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,330
Scott: Well, I didn't play that one.

530
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,221
Scott: I must have played a different super punch-out arcade that came out in the 90s.

531
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:58,295
Scott: But anyway, there was a. So Mike Tyson's punch-out.

532
00:35:58,536 --> 00:36:03,770
Scott: the gameplay is great because it's just these simple patterns the your reaction times.

533
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:15,229
Rym: It's so simple, but so elegant and so beautiful like it's a game that once you have Mastered it once you are able to beat all of the opponents then there's not really fun to play anymore.

534
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:18,963
Rym: Luckily Not many people have mastered the game to that degree.

535
00:36:19,103 --> 00:36:20,550
Rym: So it's fun for pretty much everyone.

536
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:28,930
Scott: Yeah even though I'm really good at it like I can get to like the Second bald bull fight and then it starts getting hard and sometimes I'll lose.

537
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:40,343
Rym: I think everyone who had this game as a kid remembers that you'd fight and fight and fight and you'd always do Okay like you'd get over a hump and then you'd beat a bunch of people like nothing and Then you'd hit piston Honda the second time and that was the fucking end.

538
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:42,330
Scott: no, no, I know a secret to beating him now.

539
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,042
Rym: Oh, yeah, but before you knew that secret.

540
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:44,706
Scott: Yeah.

541
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:48,790
Scott: Yeah When you get to Sona Popinski is when it starts to get a little bit difficult.

542
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:58,227
Rym: Of course, I think the funniest thing was I Scott apparently did not know until Yesterday that you can be Don Flamenco pretty much without having to do anything.

543
00:36:58,428 --> 00:36:58,749
Scott: Yeah.

544
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:00,179
Scott: Yeah I just kind of beat him up.

545
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,730
Scott: Normally, you know, it's it's weird.

546
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,252
Scott: I like that's.

547
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:07,809
Scott: the other great thing about this game is that you know there there's patterns You can follow to beat guys.

548
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,669
Scott: But there's actually for the easier guys in the game and some of the harder guys in the game.

549
00:37:13,071 --> 00:37:15,779
Scott: There's sort of like other clever things you can do.

550
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:18,528
Scott: like for example, who's the German guy you fight right away?

551
00:37:18,548 --> 00:37:21,990
Scott: Oh Von Kaiser right when you fight von Kaiser, right?

552
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:27,330
Scott: He does this move where he'll duck down into the left and then he'll do an uppercut, right?

553
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:33,089
Scott: So the the the the moron who doesn't know how to play will just get hit by the uppercut or block it.

554
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:35,469
Rym: Maybe they'll be smarter and they'll duck it or dodge it.

555
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:41,330
Scott: But right or dodge it the slightly better player will dodge it then immediately hit him in the face.

556
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:44,869
Scott: Thus stunning him allowing you to hit him in the face a few more times, right?

557
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:52,170
Scott: The super advanced player will actually do a low punch to the left while he's ducking to the left.

558
00:37:52,210 --> 00:38:01,369
Scott: You can hit him while he's ducking down there and that will get you a star and which you can then dodge his next uppercut and use the star on him and knock him down.

559
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:04,065
Scott: and It that's it's really good.

560
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:04,570
Scott: I like that.

561
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,794
Scott: You know you have it's.

562
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:07,480
Scott: it's not just one of those games.

563
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,908
Scott: you memorize the pattern and then react to the pattern.

564
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,589
Scott: quickly enough The pattern you can actually mix it up.

565
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:22,550
Scott: You can choose different moves get a little bit of strategy in there Try something more clever and usually the more daring the more difficult patterns usually give you the better rewards.

566
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:25,677
Rym: I think I mean that's what makes the game great.

567
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:34,144
Rym: is that and I think a lot of game designers forget this fact and a Game does not have to be terribly complex to be a great game.

568
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:37,747
Rym: What you have to do is Figure out what you want the game to be.

569
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:43,428
Rym: Make the game complex enough to provide what you wanted and then perfect that.

570
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:50,090
Scott: yeah I noticed this is really really evident in a lot of sports games across the board, you know, look at ice hockey, right?

571
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,640
Scott: What are the buttons in ice hockey?

572
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:52,989
Scott: shoot pass?

573
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,579
Scott: Hit somebody right that.

574
00:38:57,282 --> 00:38:58,286
Scott: what else do you need?

575
00:38:58,406 --> 00:38:59,370
Scott: modern hockey games?

576
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,617
Scott: They give you all these extra buttons.

577
00:39:00,698 --> 00:39:01,402
Scott: hit them this way.

578
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:02,850
Scott: hit them that way go faster.

579
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:05,030
Scott: You don't need those buttons all you need.

580
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:09,446
Rym: I think this is why the pass and shoot Nintendo sports games always seem to come out on time for.

581
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:14,250
Scott: look even today Even the crazy Madden people if you ask them was the best football game ever.

582
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:22,450
Scott: they will all say like Tecmo Super Bowl for the NES because it just it had Enough of a football game in there to be a football game.

583
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,916
Scott: Recognizedly football and fun.

584
00:39:23,956 --> 00:39:27,530
Scott: as football I mean if you know they're putting in too much, but you know how to play football.

585
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:32,670
Rym: Even if you barely know how to play football you can sit down and play that game and have a good time.

586
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:40,095
Scott: Yeah Now you play like Madden and you have to know all these extra controls like dodge to the left dodge to the right spin Dive all these different things.

587
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:43,745
Scott: Just give me run away from the guy or lateral.

588
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:45,630
Scott: Those are the really only buttons you need, you know.

589
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:56,292
Scott: Making it more complex than that makes the game You know less accessible and less fun and punch-out is still better than any, you know People have come out with these super realistic Boxing games.

590
00:39:56,333 --> 00:40:07,942
Scott: or you can throw punches exactly where you want to and do all sorts of different crazy moves and actually control walking around the ring in 3d and None of them respond as punch-out not even close by a mile.

591
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:17,901
Scott: yet punch-out is the much simpler game And I really think we'd be very well served if somebody made another game That was not any more complex than punch-out.

592
00:40:17,941 --> 00:40:20,410
Scott: just throw in new characters and different patterns.

593
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:23,930
Rym: I think punch-out has enough complexity to work.

594
00:40:24,775 --> 00:40:27,410
Rym: I would love to see people on the internet to start hacking this ROM.

595
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:31,445
Scott: Of course the people keep hacking all these other ROMs like making you know why they're probably not.

596
00:40:31,787 --> 00:40:37,750
Scott: yeah, damn you MMC - damn you MC - but yeah people hack the mario 3s and they make new levels.

597
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,555
Scott: No, it'd be like Super Nintendo games.

598
00:40:39,676 --> 00:40:42,344
Rym: It would be easier just to remake this game.

599
00:40:42,424 --> 00:40:44,350
Rym: I've already reverse engineered it in my head.

600
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,373
Rym: I know how it works.

601
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:46,758
Scott: Yeah, it's not difficult.

602
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:51,436
Rym: I Interesting characters.

603
00:40:51,477 --> 00:40:53,509
Rym: it would take me years to get bored with it.

604
00:40:53,738 --> 00:41:04,250
Scott: Yeah If you just kept give coming up with new characters with new moves and new racism's and new racism's Then you could just play punch-out forever and ever as long as the new guys aren't lame.

605
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:07,769
Rym: Yes, I mean think this is the game that brought us king hippo.

606
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:10,899
Rym: Yep, a lot of people don't remember that this is working.

607
00:41:10,939 --> 00:41:11,601
Rym: hippo came from.

608
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:14,430
Rym: they watch captain n and king hippo was there.

609
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:18,254
Rym: He was just some fat Filipino guy Filipino really?

610
00:41:18,314 --> 00:41:19,419
Rym: I think he's Hawaiian.

611
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,102
Scott: He's Hawaiian.

612
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:21,086
Scott: I think no.

613
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,172
Rym: hippo island Pacific.

614
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:24,999
Scott: he's Hawaiian whatever.

615
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:26,324
Rym: He's from hippo island.

616
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:27,368
Rym: He's hippo.

617
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:29,515
Scott: I'm sure Who is everyone?

618
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:29,997
Scott: They're fat.

619
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:31,622
Scott: Anyway, you're my I think he's.

620
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,970
Rym: uh, if you live on hippo island, you'd better be fat.

621
00:41:34,111 --> 00:41:38,250
Scott: I think the guy who played king hippo is the same guy who played the chief and star traffic.

622
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,368
Scott: But yet so there was also.

623
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:57,208
Scott: So punch-out is perhaps the greatest is no it's definitely the greatest boxing game ever because excellent gameplay excellent music Excellent characters and and bald bull because pretty much every kid would die on bald bull the second times.

624
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,740
Rym: you even the first time When you never feels dangerous the first time if you didn't know you're doing.

625
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:02,588
Rym: what I'm saying is a new player like you're.

626
00:42:02,808 --> 00:42:05,170
Rym: you're playing This game and like I'm gonna beat this game.

627
00:42:06,011 --> 00:42:07,598
Rym: Don flamenco is a was some.

628
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:10,430
Rym: king hippo is easy once you figure them out and great tigers pretty easy.

629
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:19,230
Scott: But great tiger used to fuck me up because I didn't know what to do about his Crazy spin move, you know, see I knew exactly what to do as long as he had enough life.

630
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:24,098
Rym: I was okay, but bald bull The thing was when you beat him that laughs.

631
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,970
Rym: the way he reacts when he wins is frightening.

632
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:34,314
Scott: I suggest if you're if you think you're really good at punch-out and you might be right go play it again But on purpose.

633
00:42:34,434 --> 00:42:35,799
Scott: lose to everyone.

634
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,710
Rym: lose every fight except glass jokes doesn't do anything, right?

635
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:45,390
Scott: Lose to the lose to Don Kaiser then beat him and lose to piston Honda then beat him and lose to Don flamenco.

636
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:48,360
Scott: Because they do funny races things.

637
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,208
Scott: when they beat you they like they do their taunt like ha ha ha I'm better than you and they're all really funny and you don't want to miss any of them.

638
00:42:56,611 --> 00:42:58,015
Scott: Alright, so you want some a super punch out?

639
00:42:58,516 --> 00:42:58,817
Rym: Sorry.

640
00:42:58,837 --> 00:42:59,118
Rym: I'm just.

641
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:06,863
Rym: I've been staring at this animated gif of Soba soda Popinski's face And he's just drinking and it says pop on that bottle.

642
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:07,365
Rym: Yeah.

643
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:15,670
Scott: Alright, so super punch-out for the Super Nintendo was Technologically superior to the first punch-out, right?

644
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:16,753
Scott: You had that.

645
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:20,910
Scott: the guys you were fighting were now like ten times the size of you instead of like three.

646
00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:22,730
Rym: Would you like to have some punch to drink?

647
00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:26,059
Scott: Yeah, the star meter works a little differently.

648
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:30,309
Scott: like yet this power-up meter on the bottom and you know It's kind of it was a little different.

649
00:43:30,571 --> 00:43:34,730
Scott: You had a lot more a few more moves you could do even though it was generally the same set of moves.

650
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,361
Scott: You know, the gameplay was basically the same, you know dodge then hit the guy.

651
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:39,204
Scott: dodge and hit the guy.

652
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:45,345
Scott: only it got much harder And basically, you know, it was the graphics are superior.

653
00:43:45,646 --> 00:43:46,650
Scott: The audio was better.

654
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:57,830
Scott: The guys would say things occasionally like, you know, the first guy you fight is not glass Joe It's Gabby J and he's like Gabby J. Yeah, like he says his name when you fight him and it's it's good stuff.

655
00:43:58,572 --> 00:43:59,575
Scott: It's not a bad game.

656
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:00,077
Scott: It's just.

657
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:04,570
Scott: it doesn't have sort of that retro charm of the original punch-out.

658
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:08,230
Scott: Of course, it was weird that the original punch-out had retro charm even when it was brand-new.

659
00:44:08,632 --> 00:44:14,297
Rym: I think part of it is that the way it's presented is like the Super a lot of the newer boxing games.

660
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:17,627
Rym: They always have like a transparent generic guy as you.

661
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:27,370
Rym: but Punch-out Mike Tyson's punch-out had little Mac and he's this little guy and you're so little and it's not like this first person.

662
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:31,484
Rym: I am playing a boxing game or I'm a wireframe dude with green hair.

663
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:33,070
Rym: It's alright.

664
00:44:33,853 --> 00:44:36,825
Rym: I am watching Little Mac and Little Mac's gonna win.

665
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:38,050
Rym: cuz Little Mac's got guts.

666
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:39,293
Scott: I just had to.

667
00:44:39,353 --> 00:44:41,339
Scott: I just recalled that Perry Bobble fellowship.

668
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:43,886
Scott: I'm ready to take on the world doc.

669
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:45,510
Scott: I feel ready.

670
00:44:46,074 --> 00:44:48,068
Scott: I'm ready to take on the world pop.

671
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,189
Scott: And then doc just do this mouth open.

672
00:44:52,390 --> 00:45:06,485
Rym: but there's just this feeling from punch-out that Little Mac can do it and the fact that his body blows he punches and If you want to hit him in the face He jumps into the air and puts his little fist up and pegs the guy.

673
00:45:06,946 --> 00:45:12,897
Rym: and when that little dude knocks down someone eight times his size You feel something there.

674
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:14,523
Scott: It's it's like a miracle.

675
00:45:14,603 --> 00:45:18,589
Rym: also the music god damn Did that game have some great music for the NES?

676
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,852
Scott: All right.

677
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:23,950
Rym: I think there's a reason that the music and punch-out has been so remix.

678
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:28,490
Scott: Yes, super super punch-out doesn't really quite have the same epic music.

679
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:33,110
Scott: It just kind of has average SNES music as better sound effects though, you know.

680
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,184
Scott: But it's it's also less racist in some ways.

681
00:45:36,324 --> 00:45:40,065
Rym: The characters just weren't as Caricatured they weren't as awesome.

682
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:40,729
Rym: I don't know it didn't.

683
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:46,770
Scott: yeah I mean they had like, you know bear hugger they had super macho man was still in there and they were kind of funny guys.

684
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:55,366
Scott: But they were less racist I guess which I guess could be a good thing in some ways, but they're also just less Appealing less awesome you don't remember.

685
00:45:55,386 --> 00:46:02,050
Scott: I mean seriously Do you remember the guys who were the bosses in any of the boxers some super punch-out?

686
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,410
Scott: Not too many of them because they're not memorable.

687
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:14,200
Scott: Every guy in the first punch-out was memorable very memorable and very hilarious in their own way except for the kids who never Got past the second ball bowl.

688
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:17,190
Rym: Yeah, cuz they never saw soda popinski.

689
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:20,470
Rym: I had a lot of friends as kids who didn't even know soda popinski existed.

690
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:21,975
Scott: Well, well they had to.

691
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:23,702
Scott: you had to know that Mike Tyson's the last guy.

692
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:27,937
Scott: so oh, yeah or mr Dream, but yeah and super punch-out.

693
00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:41,210
Scott: basically you fight in these like, you know, there's different, you know Championships and like each one is for guys and after you beat all of them a new one opens up and the the ones Before the new ones opens up are actually kind of playable.

694
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:45,490
Scott: But the one that that last one is like freaking impossible without cheating.

695
00:46:45,611 --> 00:46:55,287
Scott: I cheated to beat it and though this basically the last two guys like these two brothers and You first fight one brother and then the even harder brother and damn they are fucking danger.

696
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:56,050
Scott: Like you can't beat them.

697
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,300
Scott: Basically, it's it's close to impossible And yet it's not.

698
00:47:00,562 --> 00:47:01,207
Scott: it's a good game.

699
00:47:01,248 --> 00:47:01,490
Scott: still.

700
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:07,315
Scott: I mean if you like punch-out and you need more super punch-out is where you're gonna get more but at the same time It's not as good.

701
00:47:07,355 --> 00:47:08,463
Rym: It's not gonna do it for you.

702
00:47:08,504 --> 00:47:09,410
Rym: You're gonna play that game.

703
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:15,713
Scott: You're gonna go right back to Mike Tyson's punch-out, which is available on the virtual console, but they changed Mike Tyson into mr Dream.

704
00:47:15,753 --> 00:47:16,802
Rym: they changed it into mr.

705
00:47:16,822 --> 00:47:17,850
Rym: Dream on every iteration.

706
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:23,884
Rym: There's a lot of talk about why they did that But from what I've heard it had nothing to do with anything Mike Tyson did.

707
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:29,732
Rym: they just didn't want to re-up Probably because he wasn't the champion anymore by the time they did Whatever.

708
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:36,603
Scott: Mike Tyson, you know for all the bad things that Mike Tyson has done in his life You have to respect his boxing talents that he had in the past.

709
00:47:36,744 --> 00:47:44,608
Rym: I recommend I think we've said this before But if you don't know anything about boxing Go search for some random boxing videos on YouTube just to you know to get a sense of them.

710
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:44,950
Scott: go

711
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:51,326
Rym: watch a bunch of random ones right and then go watch a Mike Tyson video

712
00:47:51,386 --> 00:47:52,870
Scott: and then go watch Muhammad Ali and

713
00:47:53,991 --> 00:48:03,209
Rym: Mike Tyson's scary because it's like no normal box is like ding and then they start boxing Mike Tyson It was like ding and then the other guy is just against the ropes being pounded on.

714
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:12,170
Scott: yeah, I mean as Gruesome as boxing is and whatever you have to say about it as a sport like watching the great boxers do their thing.

715
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:21,585
Scott: It's like the way their bodies move is like this amazing thing That is like not to be a great boxer is is not even in the same class as other boxers.

716
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:27,865
Rym: like great boxers boxing Against normal boxers is like me trying to do kendo against katsu.

717
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:30,017
Scott: Yeah, seriously There's a this.

718
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:36,689
Scott: if you search for Muhammad Ali on YouTube There's gonna be this one black and white video that shows up and that's like the best boxing ever seen in my life.

719
00:48:37,553 --> 00:48:40,064
Scott: He just oh he throws so many punches so quickly.

720
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:42,293
Rym: It's Kind of frightening.

721
00:48:42,534 --> 00:48:43,617
Scott: it's incredibly frightening.

722
00:48:43,918 --> 00:48:50,297
Rym: cuz then you see if like Scott little Mac is 17 years old He's four foot eight 107 pounds.

723
00:48:50,337 --> 00:48:52,002
Rym: Go little Mac go from Bronx.

724
00:48:52,464 --> 00:48:53,206
Scott: Go to Mac.

725
00:48:53,427 --> 00:48:54,289
Rym: He's from the Bronx.

726
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,795
Scott: represent Both day guy.

727
00:48:58,916 --> 00:48:59,779
Rym: I can't win doc.

728
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,843
Rym: He's hurt me doc.

729
00:49:00,863 --> 00:49:03,818
Scott: Oh There's also the Selectric.

730
00:49:04,704 --> 00:49:05,409
Rym: Oh, yeah, you know what?

731
00:49:06,452 --> 00:49:08,445
Rym: There's a note about that in the instruction book.

732
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:09,008
Scott: What does it say?

733
00:49:09,592 --> 00:49:11,224
Rym: The Selectric wasn't really a trick.

734
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:12,070
Rym: It was part of the game.

735
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:20,824
Rym: all right, you can hold select between our rounds of a boxing match and Doc Lewis will massage you faster to get your health back.

736
00:49:21,145 --> 00:49:22,630
Rym: Yeah, it also weakens your punches.

737
00:49:23,692 --> 00:49:29,448
Scott: Yeah Yeah but yet the Well punch out.

738
00:49:30,314 --> 00:49:35,870
Scott: I think it's another thing about punch out is the way in which the controls Like sort of matched what was going on?

739
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:46,910
Scott: like you push B the left-hand button right to punch of the left hand and a to hit with the right hand and Then when you got knocked down you would push a and B a whole lot to try to get back up.

740
00:49:48,912 --> 00:49:55,800
Scott: You know in that rapid pushing of the buttons while you were trying to get up made you it sort of brought you close to Little Mac like get up.

741
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:59,559
Rym: Come on There is also this kind of end game.

742
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:00,000
Rym: where are?

743
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,050
Rym: you can beat the game now beat it better because you can get TKOs.

744
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:09,550
Rym: You can knock people over three times, which is how you beat most people but you can knock out every single person in this game.

745
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,758
Scott: Yeah, I mean most of the guy.

746
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:20,550
Scott: like I was saying before, you know when you fight guys there's ways to beat them up in which you know you just sort of dodge and then beat them up and Then dodge and beat them up and that's sort of like the basic strategy and it works.

747
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:24,290
Scott: You'll beat most of the guys that way but you won't get knockouts.

748
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:29,979
Scott: You'll knock them out three times in a single round and then Mario come out and just say TKO Which means you still win.

749
00:50:30,019 --> 00:50:31,189
Scott: it's a technical knockout, right?

750
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:32,692
Rym: But

751
00:50:32,712 --> 00:50:41,970
Scott: if there's a way to actually knock every guy out in the game to make him stay down for ten whole seconds And then you win and I only know how to do it for maybe like five or six guys

752
00:50:42,593 --> 00:50:42,733
Rym: No,

753
00:50:43,115 --> 00:50:45,165
Scott: oh, you can't fail to knock out King hip-hut now.

754
00:50:45,286 --> 00:50:49,227
Scott: Well, unless you die I guess if you beat him if you knock him down, he can't get up.

755
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:55,250
Rym: He's so fat now, uh, hmm, I Have one very important warning for all of you.

756
00:50:55,476 --> 00:50:58,183
Rym: I mentioned Captain and the game master a little while ago.

757
00:50:58,203 --> 00:50:59,707
Rym: if you don't know what that is Don't look it up.

758
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:09,844
Rym: And if you do know what that is, and you haven't watched it since you became an adult don't not Do not go back and try to watch that show.

759
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:10,687
Rym: That's like he-man.

760
00:51:10,727 --> 00:51:15,190
Scott: like when I was a kid I loved he-man and then when I was older I had forgotten what he-man actually was.

761
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:17,069
Scott: But I remembered liking he-man as a kid.

762
00:51:17,412 --> 00:51:28,939
Scott: So I tried to re I tried to go back and when the internet finally gave me the ability I got some he-man and I went back and I saw the he-man that I remembered loving as a child and I wish I had not Because he-man sucks.

763
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:31,550
Rym: see She-Ra was actually far superior.

764
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,677
Scott: It was far superior, but it still wasn't that good.

765
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:34,198
Rym: No.

766
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:37,870
Rym: No, but Captain N really really takes the cake for being bad.

767
00:51:38,093 --> 00:51:39,148
Scott: Oh, it is so bad.

768
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:43,425
Rym: I mean watch that and the Super Mario Brothers Super Show suddenly becomes a whole lot better.

769
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:46,397
Scott: Super Mario Brothers Super Show becomes Shakespeare compared to Captain N.

770
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:52,510
Rym: Oh Wow someone made Little Mac's diary.

771
00:51:54,230 --> 00:52:02,230
Rym: Wow, wow The 16-page diary, okay, okay, okay, so get punch out.

772
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:03,273
Scott: Oh, it's kind of cute.

773
00:52:04,256 --> 00:52:05,239
Rym: Oh, it's kind of never mind.

774
00:52:05,299 --> 00:52:05,700
Rym: It's not.

775
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,185
Scott: they should make punch out DS.

776
00:52:07,887 --> 00:52:12,517
Scott: Yes, they should versus Versus punch out and I don't know that would work.

777
00:52:12,678 --> 00:52:17,970
Rym: thing is versus punch out would only work if One you have to get a little bit more control.

778
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:21,576
Rym: You'd have to be able to like at least Like say hey get this.

779
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:28,883
Rym: say you could take your guy and customize and pick the nose pick the face You make a caricature stereotype for your dude.

780
00:52:29,164 --> 00:52:34,990
Rym: All right, and then You have a list of kinds of moves and you can like set them up.

781
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,910
Rym: So like if I do a right like the controls wouldn't be any different you set it up.

782
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:49,630
Rym: So if I do a like a right body blow It does the Kaiser body blow or it does the mr Dream body blow and you can mix it up and make your custom character and then box like you choose from a set of moves.

783
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:51,497
Scott: You know, the problem is right.

784
00:52:51,598 --> 00:52:52,280
Scott: How would that work?

785
00:52:52,361 --> 00:52:53,124
Scott: Cuz what?

786
00:52:53,184 --> 00:52:54,690
Scott: oh, you know, I think it has to be Little Mac.

787
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:55,736
Rym: You know, I'd make it work.

788
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,244
Rym: I see my screen.

789
00:52:57,566 --> 00:53:00,316

Rym: It's just Little Mac versus Little Mac.

794
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:08,443
Scott: It might work.
