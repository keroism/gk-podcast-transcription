1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,400
Rym:

2
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:18,619
Scott: I'm Rym Scott and I'm Epidiah and we are here today to talk about Epidiah's amazing new tabletop role-playing game wolf spell.

3
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:25,475
Guest: Let's do this All right.

4
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,303
Scott: Welcome to the show at B. How you doing?

5
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:28,227
Guest: I'm doing well.

6
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:28,629
Guest: How are you?

7
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:30,614
Scott: You know good considered.

8
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:33,422
Scott: I guess that's what everyone would say these days, right?

9
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:35,467
Rym: My stock line is there's an asterisk there.

10
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:39,394
Scott: Yeah, exactly Good asterisk All right.

11
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:44,469
Scott: So, you know, we're gonna talk primarily I guess about wolf spell today obviously because that's your new your new hotness.

12
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,557
Scott: We'll talk about other things later.

13
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:53,408
Scott: All right, so so wolf spell this this big final album cover situation here, right.

14
00:00:54,353 --> 00:01:03,623
Scott: So I think that what the meme is what disappeared in swords without master Worlds without master volume - yes - that is correct.

15
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:06,030
Scott: Yeah, so I noticed that on Twitter a lot.

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,183
Scott: It's always like wolf spell appeared in worlds without master number two.

17
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:15,598
Scott: swords without master appeared in You know worlds without master number three, right?

18
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,503
Scott: What's the let's first address?

19
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:19,448
Scott: What's the worlds without master, right?

20
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:23,183
Guest: Oh, okay Yeah, so I'm gonna say six years ago.

21
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:28,004
Guest: I don't know how old I am anymore I don't know how old anything is anymore, but somewhere around six years ago.

22
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:41,776
Guest: I did a digital magazine sword and sorcery magazine for 11 issues Called worlds without master which included sword and sorcery fiction and each One had a game in it.

23
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:55,367
Guest: because I I knew that if I if I was selling something I was more likely to sell something with a game in it than I was to just be like hey enjoy my fiction and each one has a little sword and sorcery comic in it.

24
00:01:55,447 --> 00:02:00,428
Guest: because I have fondness for the old dragon magazines and the the comics that are in there.

25
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:20,861
Guest: and And Yeah, it was Something that came about when patreon first showed up Because it looked like a way to fund something like that Not not rolling in cash, so I can't just make a magazine Which is you know a dying industry.

26
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:26,616
Guest: Anyways, I have to like somehow budget, so For a while there.

27
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:29,010
Guest: It wasn't like a monthly or bi-monthly schedule.

28
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,190
Guest: It was like whenever I get done with an issue I get done with an issue schedule.

29
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:39,230
Guest: But for a while there, I had this sort of pressure to get games done and put in which was good.

30
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:40,809
Guest: It was like a creative drive.

31
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:44,229
Guest: Some of the games in there are not mine, but some of them are mine.

32
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:55,660
Guest: and The first issue had a game called into the Avenger, which isn't one of mine but I have a piece of short fiction in each one.

33
00:02:56,223 --> 00:03:11,109
Guest: and in the second Issue I was writing a story for it called one winters due and this story is a. it's about a group of adventurers who have to turn themselves into wolves in order to solve a problem.

34
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,778
Guest: and I wrote that story and halfway through the story.

35
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:18,191
Guest: I was like am I I Really?

36
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:19,396
Guest: I really enjoyed that story.

37
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:26,929
Guest: I really really liked that story, but I was wondering am I wasting a really good role-playing game on a Piece of short fiction?

38
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:32,090
Guest: Would I waste a really good piece of short fiction on a role-playing game?

39
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,174
Guest: Like what what's?

40
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:34,681
Guest: and then that's.

41
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:36,590
Guest: I was like, well, I don't have a game for this issue.

42
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:38,579
Guest: So why don't I write that role-playing game?

43
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:40,850
Guest: and that's the origin of wolf spell?

44
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,319
Rym: That's fascinating because usually I see the opposite.

45
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:47,496
Rym: if someone has a game and then they write a story using the game Yeah, it was.

46
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:48,401
Guest: I mean it was.

47
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:52,583
Guest: the premise itself was so Captivating to me.

48
00:03:53,791 --> 00:04:01,216
Guest: Just this this idea that they had in the story it's this like Problem with oaths that they've taken.

49
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:04,887
Guest: they have to like solve a blood debt and and one of them has taken.

50
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:11,109
Guest: of these two sisters one has taken an oath not to do it and the other is taking an oath to make sure it gets done.

51
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:18,991
Guest: and So they're like, well if we if we keep doing it, it'll just go back and forth and these two families will keep killing each Other.

52
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:29,461
Guest: but if some wolves happen to kill them Then maybe We can and it goes downhill from there like all good adventures do.

53
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:30,568
Guest: yeah, exactly.

54
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:44,388
Guest: and so yeah, I really like this idea of these adventurers who have put themselves in the bodies, but also somewhat in the minds of wolves.

55
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:48,122
Guest: and So the game kind of comes out of that duality.

56
00:04:48,603 --> 00:05:08,638
Guest: you play adventures Of the sword and sorcery type of the kind that we all are familiar with in our fantasy role-playing games who are At a point in their lives where they need in order to accomplish something in order to solve some dire quest They have to transform into wolves.

57
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:24,488
Guest: So the game starts off with you choosing which characters fit what kind of archetypes and then you become wolves and You interact with the world as wolves with human minds and you try to solve.

58
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:30,526
Guest: you try to Complete your quest and see in the end if you manage to return to human form.

59
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,193
Guest: I see human.

60
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:37,857
Guest: I try to hedge my bets on human there because I like If people want to play elves that do it.

61
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:38,560
Guest: I'm fine with that.

62
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,105
Guest: Like I just didn't right.

63
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,229
Scott: I hadn't even considered that.

64
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:45,189
Guest: Yeah Yeah, I just didn't write elf rules into the game.

65
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:47,116
Scott: But would you need to?

66
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:49,989
Scott: because like you're playing the game once you're be a wolf, right?

67
00:05:50,089 --> 00:06:00,275
Guest: Yeah Yeah, so I like in in the text I use the word civilization to represent the quote-unquote human mind.

68
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:01,762
Guest: or it's the blood diet.

69
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:09,918
Guest: that way if people are like We're I mean cuz it'd be a lot of fun to be like a bunch of dwarves who have to turn into mountain wolves to Deal with something.

70
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,310
Scott: I think we know we're doing next time.

71
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:17,488
Guest: Yeah So I didn't want to like step on those toes at all.

72
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:20,778
Scott: so Now you've done better.

73
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,348
Scott: you've shown toes I didn't even see.

74
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:30,810
Rym: yeah So mechanically like the game is fairly straightforward like we've played it with our group and we'll maybe talk about our first experiences with it.

75
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,305
Rym: But like what are the mechanics you're really focused on?

76
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:34,110
Rym: to make your story?

77
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,262
Rym: Work or to make the game tell the kind of story you wanted?

78
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:39,270
Guest: so you've got two dice in the game.

79
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:41,330
Guest: You have your blood die and your wolf die.

80
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:56,313
Guest: They're both six-sided dice and you're gonna roll them and you're gonna look to see which one is higher and this determines For your character what side of your character is in charge, right and depending on Which die is higher.

81
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:02,050
Guest: it's going to limit your options to things that a human would do or be capable of doing.

82
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:06,270
Guest: Again, you're in wolf in the body of wolves.

83
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:13,249
Guest: So it's more about like how a human would look at a situation and less like having opposable thumbs or anything like that.

84
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:23,403
Guest: and if the wolf dies higher then you kind of embrace those instincts and You do the sort of thing that a wolf would do.

85
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:37,182
Guest: and in the game I did like I don't know I don't make it terribly evident But like the things that wolves do are keep themselves safe and away from harm Which is the thing that human adventures don't right.

86
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:54,445
Guest: so if you want to throw yourself at the danger Getting the human side is actually better than the wolf side But you're more likely to end up sacrificing yourself or some member of the party doing that the wolf the human has like.

87
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:55,412
Guest: Like.

88
00:07:55,452 --> 00:08:01,863
Guest: if you look at the world the human gets to ask all these analytical questions about what's going on Whereas the wolf is like, what do I smell?

89
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:02,949
Guest: What do I taste?

90
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:14,955
Guest: you know, it's it's more of the the more visceral side of things and So you have that duality and then to kind of nail that home.

91
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:42,438
Guest: there is one stat which is your feral and That goes up as you play the game and the higher it gets you just add it to your wolf die, so you just get better and better at being a wolf which Generally speaking makes your life easier Until the very end and you know, I'm not gonna worry about spoilers here or anything like that at the very end You got to make a roll to see if you're gonna be human again And that feral is going to.

92
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,102
Guest: it's gonna bite you right.

93
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:48,189
Guest: like the higher your federal score is The less likely you are to become human.

94
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:55,069
Guest: Although like some of those results if you're if you're like, yeah, I wouldn't mind being a wolf then yeah go for it.

95
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,956
Guest: the worst results are if you Roll.

96
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:03,032
Guest: if the dice are similar Insides, right?

97
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:12,239
Guest: Like if they tie that's bad and especially in that last one if they tie you end up Not not comfortable in either situation.

98
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:14,967
Rym: that actually happened to the my first play of this.

99
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,070
Rym: That was exactly what happened.

100
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,944
Rym: I went very feral, but the way things went my die rolls.

101
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:24,368
Rym: I had a very For the character unsatisfying ending not the player but for the character, right?

102
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:24,769
Guest: Yeah.

103
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:30,048
Rym: So if you notice like people playing your game like feedback you get are you playing it?

104
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:34,090
Rym: Do people tend to try to remain human?

105
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,402
Rym: Do you find players tend to like dive into the wolf side?

106
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:38,467
Rym: I'll be a wolf forever.

107
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:39,512
Rym: Let's roll Like.

108
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:40,739
Rym: how does that tend to play out?

109
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,389
Guest: It's it's really.

110
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:49,285
Guest: It's a fun meta game for me to play when I run it Because you sit down.

111
00:09:50,473 --> 00:10:01,371
Guest: For me like my favorite moment running the game is we go through we make the Adventurers, you know, which is just basically saying I'm the one that kills people and I'm the one that knows magic, you know Whatever.

112
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:04,266
Guest: I don't want to dismiss my mechanics, but it's very simple.

113
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:04,889
Guest: It's very simple.

114
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,224
Guest: And then there's that moment in the game.

115
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:12,377
Guest: I got to open my book One second the book for the listener.

116
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:15,766
Rym: This is a record like album cover.

117
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:21,295
Guest: It's we'll talk about that Where it says you are now wolves.

118
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:25,810
Guest: describe your coat your size your scent and your voice and like.

119
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:38,135
Guest: that's the moment when everyone when it becomes very real to everyone that they're all they're a wolf because they have they're like, I know very few people think of how their Player characters smell.

120
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:57,008
Guest: I think I do you know like that kind of and then once that happens I I can start laying bets on who is going to Like who wants a tragic story out of this who's like I'm gonna be a wolf till the end of time And who's gonna be like, oh, oh, wait a minute.

121
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:13,387
Guest: I didn't want to be this like or not not the player but like they realize that their character is like I want out of this I want to want to get back to my the streets of humanity Get back to cheating people at cards or whatever it is.

122
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:13,929
Guest: They do that.

123
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:20,230
Scott: Yeah, I think when we played I ran the game and I actually had I made sure everyone read the rules in advance.

124
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:24,810
Scott: Yeah, so they sort of knew but I would I. when I ran it I still went through everything in order.

125
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,701
Scott: But I had to remind everyone from the beginning like you're not wolves yet.

126
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:29,584
Scott: You're not wolves yet.

127
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:29,844
Scott: Yeah.

128
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:31,690
Scott: Yeah now you're wolves, right?

129
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:33,450
Scott: You know.

130
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,072
Scott: But I could.

131
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:40,410
Scott: I was able to see that same thing only earlier because people having read it in advance already had wolf on the brain.

132
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:41,520
Guest: Yeah, yeah start right.

133
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:46,970
Rym: But then some of them a few of our players did like in terms of the order.

134
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:55,749
Rym: I'm curious how much like how you crafted the character creation bit because it basically assumes you don't have a character idea in mind in advance and the way the questioning work.

135
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:17,450
Rym: a Lot of our players ended up with characters that were probably very different from what they envisioned coming in but then when as soon as they became wolves they had that same sort of moment of realization and Some of the people who I expected would be very down with the wolf after their character got created They described their wolf and then they really tried to become human again because they liked that character that had come out of the questioning.

136
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:22,209
Guest: Yeah, I mean I love questions.

137
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:25,825
Guest: Yeah, that's a that goes way back for me.

138
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,705
Guest: It's a great Questions - right?

139
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:29,268
Guest: Yeah.

140
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:44,575
Guest: Yeah the the only character creation mechanic in dread is just to ask these leading questions because and This serves a similar function that it doesn't dread where it really kind of Fits you into that character.

141
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:48,187
Guest: you you it you invest in it, right?

142
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:48,969
Guest: It's in.

143
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:57,310
Guest: You've spent the time thinking about it and then you're like, oh no Look, I was totally ready to throw this character away and be a good doggo.

144
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,930
Guest: But oops, I know that doesn't happen to everyone obviously, but like yeah, I definitely wanted that.

145
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:17,307
Guest: there's also an artifact to how this is done where I wanted it open enough that people could throw it on to Ongoing campaign in another system if they want it.

146
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:35,610
Guest: So there's like it's open enough So you could play that character creation and it's just converting the character to wolf spell right like that's Just answering those questions and I you'd have to do a little bit more work than that, but not not a ton.

147
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:40,309
Guest: I wanted to make it obvious, but you know, I didn't want to.

148
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:51,460
Guest: and the other thing is that like I don't think it's a good idea for every group to take an ongoing campaign and play wolf spell Because you you're gonna lose characters like.

149
00:13:51,500 --> 00:14:03,510
Guest: that's a Both both to like becoming wolves which you know, you know If you got an ongoing burning wheel campaign, you're like, well now I get to make up a wolf.

150
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:04,975
Guest: Give me that monster burner.

151
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:09,189
Guest: That's you know, that might be a yeah, I I would enjoy that.

152
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:17,128
Guest: but also the there's a frailty to the characters that I think people don't expect until the first wolf gets injured.

153
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:23,702
Guest: and then you know you read these the Rules for for harm.

154
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:27,529
Guest: Gotta open my book again.

155
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:33,930
Rym: We definitely saw that our care players as soon as there was real danger for the first time everyone backed the heck off.

156
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:40,390
Scott: Yeah, I just want to point I point out this to listeners whenever there's any kind of RPG thing going on, right?

157
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,346
Scott: It's like look, here's the person who made the game checking the book already for the second time.

158
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:48,090
Scott: Yeah Out of the ordinary in any way whatsoever.

159
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,348
Guest: No, I I tell people like I write these in a book for a reason.

160
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:55,789
Guest: I don't I don't want to have to remember this shit.

161
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:04,530
Guest: Yeah, the the suffering harm when when when you suffer harm in the game there are three options.

162
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,310
Guest: One of them increases your feral.

163
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:11,780
Guest: It will either increases or decreases.

164
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,729
Guest: it's up to you and you get like a scar.

165
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:17,107
Guest: One of them is that you lose a limb or an eye and then another ones.

166
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:17,550
Guest: you're dead.

167
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:19,036
Guest: And you can.

168
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:21,929
Guest: you pick one of those three and you can't pick that one again next time.

169
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:33,969
Guest: And I think the first time someone goes through that list everyone else in the group is like, oh Okay Wolves are badass, but like they're also mortal creatures.

170
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:50,710
Scott: So I just want to go back to the leading questions Mechanic for a second at least for me the thing I like about it a lot is it feels like you're doing a collaborative Creation because the person asking the question sort of gets to decide something about your character and then you decide the rest.

171
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:59,310
Scott: So it's like it's always like a team effort You know, it's easy to see in retrospect, but there's no way I could have thought of that out of nothing, right?

172
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:01,268
Scott: Yeah, so like where did that like?

173
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,881
Scott: idea of using the leading questions like originate from.

174
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:08,634
Guest: so there's like two Sort origins there.

175
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:12,183
Guest: One of them is running dread at conventions.

176
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:18,718
Guest: Yeah, I'd like that game is 15. no, it would okay.

177
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,390
Guest: I've been running dread at conventions.

178
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:22,877
Guest: I first started running.

179
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:23,781
Guest: Let me put it this way.

180
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:29,957
Guest: I first started running dread at conventions 20 years ago, so that's The game itself.

181
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,810
Guest: is like the the book that everyone knows about 15 years old.

182
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,908
Guest: But we were running it for about five years before we published the book.

183
00:16:37,014 --> 00:16:52,763
Guest: We ran it all the time just constantly and One of the things that started to happen is that you just get not to knock the game You just get bored of it right like you you as the.

184
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:55,010
Guest: I'm sure this happens with musicians.

185
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,661
Guest: I'm sure that they have songs that they just don't.

186
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:17,502
Guest: if they never had to play them again They'd be happy, you know or yeah, and I don't have a problem with dread but like having to come up with all of those questions again, so What I did was I just started to come excuse me I started to create a little demo that I could do.

187
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:24,101
Guest: that ran faster than normal dread and Forced other people to come up with those questions for everyone else.

188
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:26,550
Guest: I was just like we're just gonna go around.

189
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:30,970
Guest: I mean, it's essentially what's in here in in wolf spell where you just go around and ask questions.

190
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:32,835
Guest: And it did.

191
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:35,369
Guest: I noticed that it did these these two things like it.

192
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:42,289
Guest: It told me what each player want it from the situation right like I could see.

193
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:46,381
Guest: You could see what what they what they were interested in.

194
00:17:46,822 --> 00:18:01,648
Guest: and then the other part that kind of solidified that is Swords of that master was published in the issue right after wolf spell In worlds, but it had been written before wolf spell and in swords of that master.

195
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:18,210
Guest: one of the design Edicts was that no Two people no one person could decide anything like all the rules are focused on one person Bringing half the equation in and then the other person bringing the other half.

196
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,162
Guest: so it had a lot of that that that duality of like.

197
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:31,567
Guest: I'll ask you a leading question or I will make a demand of you and you answer that demand because I Find that more.

198
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:46,200
Guest: Oh, I just it's more interesting to me when I play like to have Even if I'm not one of the two people coming up with it I it just feels more engaging to me to have rather than have like one person monologue or or whatever.

199
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,960
Guest: Not to to you know, however, people want to play is fine by them.

200
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,427
Guest: I just I design games that I enjoy playing.

201
00:18:53,447 --> 00:19:00,852
Guest: I think I would go a little a little A little off the rails if I didn't.

202
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:03,527
Rym: so so how Leading do you see?

203
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:06,620
Rym: players tend to do this because our group with those leading questions?

204
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,906
Rym: People went right for the throat with things.

205
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:10,853
Rym: Like how did you lose your eye?

206
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:15,279
Rym: Why did you murder your companion like they just the first round of?

207
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:22,774
Scott: But that as soon as this, you know, I as soon as someone gives a good example Right of like a leading question everyone else goes.

208
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,818
Scott: Oh Every question from then on is a killer.

209
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:29,031
Guest: I think I think that's exactly.

210
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:35,130
Guest: is you just need one person to just Dip their toes into the the forbidden waters.

211
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:40,969
Guest: I mean everyone's like, oh hold on Because because we you.

212
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:49,597
Guest: there's a there's definitely a culture that that has been like sort of handed down to role-playing in general through D&D.

213
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:57,756
Guest: that like Sometimes is it's not evident that you can step out of sight outside of certain boundaries.

214
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,020
Guest: that would you know.

215
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:03,720
Guest: I feel like in a lot of D&D games you wouldn't be allowed to ask these kind of questions and go with them.

216
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:06,313
Guest: I think it wouldn't necessarily break the game to do that.

217
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:20,000
Guest: But I think that that's People would be like, oh and but so yeah, once you get a little taste of it, you're like, oh, okay Yes, let's let's see how and it it's helpful that it's usually just a one-shot.

218
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:20,778
Guest: You're just playing.

219
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,899
Guest: You know that this this one story out.

220
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:28,784
Guest: so Yeah, why not go for it right?

221
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:34,379
Guest: Like you're not ruining somebody's character for again, like a campaign or anything like that.

222
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:58,280
Guest: Mmm, although I have played Return returning games of wolf spell which is a Particularly fun thing to do when you have characters that have become wolves and now you've got those players playing new people Who you don't need like the the players who in the previous game were unable to return back to human form.

223
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:07,160
Guest: And so they're like, I'm gonna make a new character and then they meet the the wolf From the previous game in the wild and oh, that's just a wonderful moment.

224
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:15,220
Scott: But the people who returned who turned back into non wolves are gonna wolf a second time.

225
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:16,219
Guest: Yeah, some of them do.

226
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:19,929
Rym: How bad could it be?

227
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:27,018
Guest: Yeah, I know how to do this and when I did it the even had people change the.

228
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:43,620
Guest: They're there who they were in the pack like they like go from being The shifty one the one that that nobody knows where they the the one that's good at lying and being sneaky to the one with the sword arm because they're like.

229
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:45,319
Guest: No, I've changed.

230
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:49,978
Guest: This is a different character now, and this is a. this is who I am.

231
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:58,735
Rym: so in terms of in terms of the scenarios like because You're talking about these rails to make this easy to set up like the game sort of has a list of.

232
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,687
Rym: these are the reasons What you're after.

233
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,816
Rym: so how did how did you decide on that set?

234
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:08,364
Rym: because it's a very short list Like how what was?

235
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:09,668
Rym: where were your goals in?

236
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,053
Scott: those used to be shorter, right?

237
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:11,836
Scott: Yeah.

238
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:15,858
Guest: Yeah, it's slightly longer And I have ones that haven't made it to this.

239
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:32,956
Guest: okay, so like we Part of part of what happened was alright, so we've got the the version of wolf spell that shows up in worlds without master and that one is Both has like a time constraint like I had to fit.

240
00:22:32,996 --> 00:23:00,666
Guest: I think I finished that one in a month and a half and and then also like I had so my rules for for worlds without master, I had like a word count and I Didn't let anyone go over it because I had a budget and I was like I want to pay you a Reasonable rate for what you're doing here.

241
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:05,140
Guest: Do not go over this word count because I cannot afford anything beyond young these words.

242
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:12,599
Guest: So the rules were like nobody gets cheated out of money or out of what they're owed in worlds unless their name is epi.

243
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:17,739
Guest: So epi could go over the word count a little bit, but I had to be very reasonable about that.

244
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:31,154
Guest: So there was this that pressure and then of course when when it came to this final form this this trifold album cover I had again There's extra material I wanted to put in here isn't?

245
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:34,770
Guest: there isn't a whole lot of it But a lot of is like to kind of clarify some things.

246
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:45,415
Guest: I rewrote a few of the the moves to just Further explain what I wanted to do with them And I've changed up some of these spells and I did.

247
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:58,884
Guest: I came up with them quite a few more spells and if even a few more pack members, but Ultimately, it just didn't fit the the layout and I was you know Through them out.

248
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:03,848
Guest: There was early early days when shell and I were shell Khan who's the artist?

249
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:04,109
Guest: who?

250
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:06,260
Guest: who did this amazing cover?

251
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:15,459
Guest: When we were talking about it I was thinking about putting like the pack members or the wolf spells as track listings on it, huh?

252
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:22,040
Guest: Yeah, but in the end I look at that art and I can't I cannot put anything over top of it, right?

253
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,514
Guest: like I was it was.

254
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:31,559
Guest: We even left like a little space where it might work and I was just in the end I was like no I can't I can't bring myself to doing that.

255
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:38,843
Guest: But I you know Yeah, so I Wanted to come up with.

256
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:51,100
Guest: I locked myself into something of a setting by naming the game master winter and that is Because it came out of that that story and that story took place during the winter.

257
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:54,200
Guest: I don't play all my games during the winter.

258
00:24:55,062 --> 00:25:22,009
Guest: So we have like games and I play a character named winter, you know, I'm the game master called winter anyways but That I mean there's this thing about when you when you make a game you don't want to Make the fullest game you want to leave bits there for people to Kind of build their own game off of.

259
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:34,519
Guest: so like I was I was perfectly happy to say stuff like oh, we'll call it winter, but if You can figure out that you can play it, you know in the summer and you know or whatever.

260
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:37,362
Rym: Do you think players get that?

261
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:38,504
Rym: like some?

262
00:25:38,564 --> 00:25:47,001
Rym: I feel like some RPG players will read the rules and follow them exactly And they set a hundred percent like sacrosanct guardrails.

263
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:52,562
Rym: and some players take the rules and they see the gaps and they try to Drive as hard door those gaps as possible.

264
00:25:52,582 --> 00:25:59,358
Guest: I Mean, yeah, I think everyone's got their own thing But like you you you can.

265
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:00,863
Guest: it's easy to design for both.

266
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:06,203
Guest: if you make a complete game that works but has this this room for play?

267
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:16,295
Guest: and then don't try to like because in the beginning I in the beginning I Used to be like.

268
00:26:16,777 --> 00:26:31,170
Guest: I wanted to tell everyone all of my ideas for how the different ways that this game would work And then in the end, I just kind of got to this thing where I was like if I do that It's just a list of things That people will get bored of reading at some point, right?

269
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,685
Guest: They won't go through it and look for.

270
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:41,827
Guest: I mean you can give them a list of things and give them some ideas of the directions that things can go but Fundamentally, they're gonna come up with their own.

271
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,853
Guest: so you just kind of want to Leave.

272
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:51,168
Guest: leave room for that to happen right like you want to let them exercise their own design minds.

273
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:58,210
Scott: Yeah, so speaking of winter one thing I noticed when I when I was winter was I actually had a difficult time.

274
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:05,323
Scott: It could be because just the way the players played applying winter's wrath I was like, I'm gonna get winter's wrath on somebody.

275
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:15,743
Scott: it's written all over this book Right, and if every time I had a chance to do it someone had a thing that said no get winter's wrath And I couldn't figure out how to get the winter's right.

276
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:16,869
Scott: it happened zero times.

277
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:19,576
Scott: So is there?

278
00:27:19,857 --> 00:27:20,962
Scott: was there something I'm missing?

279
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:26,683
Guest: or I mean like it's Winter's wrath is one of those to some extent?

280
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:28,110
Guest: is there to soak up some of those?

281
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:33,512
Guest: Oh, I've got an extra thing to you know, put in here like It's.

282
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:39,210
Guest: it's basically a way to punish people not punish people.

283
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:42,154
Guest: It's a really bad way to put it.

284
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:43,097
Guest: it's.

285
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:48,594
Guest: it's a way to create a consequence for for actions that isn't immediate Right good.

286
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:52,550
Guest: So the effect of winter's wrath generally speaking is that when you face the peril?

287
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,475
Guest: You're going to be in trouble.

288
00:27:54,595 --> 00:28:12,130
Guest: You're you're going to have and I didn't want like Hit points and we have something a king to hit points in the harm, you know, but So I wanted something that said hey, you're you're feeling blue because you couldn't wrestle.

289
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,884
Guest: So now when something bad happens, you're just not you.

290
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:29,950
Guest: you're in that you know as the pack is loping across the the The plains or whatever the tundra You're at a spot where you're vulnerable because you don't feel like you're a part of the pack.

291
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,384
Guest: You're maybe I would a little bit further than everyone else or something like that.

292
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:37,920
Guest: So when the peril hits The the winter is going to focus on you.

293
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,766
Guest: Mm-hmm I think it's okay if nobody gets it.

294
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:47,849
Guest: But I also that's probably due to some pretty good rolling or maybe they were just like nobody.

295
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:48,994
Guest: Everyone's like.

296
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:51,003
Guest: I don't want to be left out of this pack.

297
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:51,826
Guest: I don't want to be.

298
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:52,429
Scott: well, I think.

299
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:53,193
Scott: yeah I think what it.

300
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,450
Scott: now that you talk about the the immediate versus the delayed consequence.

301
00:28:56,611 --> 00:29:00,770
Scott: I do remember people will seem to be intentionally opting for the immediate consequence.

302
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:07,890
Scott: It's like yeah, I'd go to winter's wrath, but basically they suffered consequences immediately every time something bad happened.

303
00:29:08,232 --> 00:29:11,170
Scott: Right, they didn't, you know, try to push them off to hold out longer.

304
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:19,640
Rym: We also had players very willing to sacrifice themselves for each other and we had a few like very I am a wolf Let's roll characters who were really just like.

305
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,703
Rym: I want to stay a while forever.

306
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:22,409
Rym: This is better than my human life.

307
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:30,464
Guest: And and the other thing about winter's wrath to maybe make you feel a little better is that it's easy to get rid of you.

308
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:37,542
Guest: just groom with the pack like which was Intentional, I wanted people to just be like, oh, you know what?

309
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:38,345
Guest: I'm not feeling good.

310
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:42,609
Guest: Maybe we just hang out We'll pick the lights off of each other or whatever it is.

311
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:47,078
Guest: Deal with some pests and there's also that rule right?

312
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:57,950
Scott: I think where it's like at immediate at least immediately after grooming or wrestling you can't be immediate peril to force force the flow the narrative flow to not be like.

313
00:29:58,251 --> 00:29:58,996
Scott: You know, you're.

314
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:05,919
Guest: yeah suddenly a bear comes Because there's a certain Temptation to do that.

315
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:14,076
Guest: I think like There's there's drama for instance like in Horror movies that happens all the time.

316
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:15,460
Guest: Anytime people are relaxed.

317
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:23,021
Guest: You're like, okay here comes, you know, like this is this is the thing and That shows up in action movies as well.

318
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:30,459
Guest: and I just wanted to be like hey Don't punish the players for being wolves.

319
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:39,324
Guest: Like that's why we're playing, you know, we're we're gonna wrestle for a bit We're gonna groom for a bit We're just gonna enjoy it and then you know the way the game works.

320
00:30:39,444 --> 00:31:00,081
Guest: for me generally speaking Is that like, you know, you have those things that just let the players do Wolfy things that are of I Don't want to say of less consequence, but like because wrestling can actually have some pretty bad consequence You know, but are more playful and more less central to your quest.

321
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:03,895
Guest: right less central to you know where the human mind is focused.

322
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:11,122
Guest: and then for me if I'm the winter it's all in the Beholding the world move.

323
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:15,869
Guest: I just like anytime somebody Like we don't know what to do.

324
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,298
Guest: I'm like does anyone want to behold the world?

325
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:27,485
Guest: because that series of questions and back-and-forth Usually inspires something right like if I'm just sitting there going I don't know what's gonna happen.

326
00:31:27,665 --> 00:31:27,926
Guest: I don't.

327
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:32,314
Guest: and then somebody's like I'm chewing on this log.

328
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,859
Guest: What can that tell me?

329
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,045
Guest: Oh, oh, yeah.

330
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:37,409
Guest: What can that tell you?

331
00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:38,788
Guest: Interesting.

332
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:43,765
Rym: That's interesting because that's exactly what Scott ended up doing.

333
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:49,846
Rym: you would basically Get us to behold the world and then you would sort of come up with what's going on from there.

334
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,879
Rym: and that pattern just emerged Over and over and over again during game during play, right?

335
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,930
Scott: Yeah, it's it's bits goes back to the leading question, right?

336
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,576
Scott: Or it's yeah, but holding the world.

337
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:05,910
Scott: They're sort of asking winter leading questions, right to fill in You know about what happens next rather than what's your character like?

338
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:08,625
Rym: Particularly like the what am I missing?

339
00:32:08,746 --> 00:32:09,470
Rym: style question?

340
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,114
Rym: Like what?

341
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,590
Rym: should I have paid attention to that?

342
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:17,829
Rym: I did like anything like that which you've done in this game just always seems to really ratchet the slow tension up.

343
00:32:18,718 --> 00:32:23,128
Guest: yeah, when When you roll a tie in the game?

344
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:31,090
Guest: so basically For the listeners is you roll these two dice you look for which ones higher and you subtract the lower one from the higher.

345
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:37,825
Guest: so you're The gradient of how well you do is based on the difference between the two dice.

346
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:48,000
Guest: if you roll a tie you pick whether you want to have like a one of wolf or a one of blood and Those are some of my favorite decisions in the game.

347
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:50,007
Guest: Some of them are just obvious and it's whatever.

348
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:52,516
Guest: that that's great you know the situation just makes it obvious.

349
00:32:52,878 --> 00:33:00,020
Guest: but like it's the like do I want a Bad wolf thing to happen or I want a bad human thing to happen?

350
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:06,689
Guest: it like that's the I really enjoy when when that comes up because it's it's that exact thing where it's like.

351
00:33:07,412 --> 00:33:09,501
Guest: What should I have noticed that I didn't?

352
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,630
Guest: or you know, how are my wolf senses?

353
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,095
Guest: Making me scared right now?

354
00:33:14,136 --> 00:33:14,537
Guest: and when?

355
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:17,309
Guest: or I again checking my room?

356
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:27,012
Guest: Yeah, ask the winter what site sounds sense or tastes confuse or scare you right like yeah All right.

357
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:29,821
Scott: So this amazing game wolf spell was an issue too.

358
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:30,604
Scott: out of you said 11.

359
00:33:30,604 --> 00:33:31,928
Scott: There's 11 total issues.

360
00:33:32,189 --> 00:33:33,589
Guest: Yeah Yeah, so why?

361
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,981
Scott: Did this one be the one to go for a Kickstarter?

362
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:40,710
Scott: get its own thing and not any of the 10 other?

363
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:41,795
Scott: Right.

364
00:33:41,837 --> 00:33:42,110
Scott: It was that.

365
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:43,918
Guest: Well, okay.

366
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:48,845
Guest: So the several of the other ones All right, like I said are other people's games.

367
00:33:48,905 --> 00:34:03,205
Guest: I think Nathan D pale Etta did in The tomb of the Mummy King and I think I don't remember if he did a Kickstarter for it But it definitely has its own physical form.

368
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:08,924
Guest: It's out there And it beat me to the punch because I'm I'm usually slowing these.

369
00:34:08,944 --> 00:34:14,342
Guest: what happened here was I Wrote that story and I knew the artist.

370
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:15,730
Guest: I wanted to illustrate the story.

371
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:22,751
Guest: So I contacted shell shell con and they did these gorgeous pictures.

372
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:33,217
Guest: there in the story, there's like a giant owl that it takes attacks the wolves and it's like Above and beyond when it comes to like what I was expecting.

373
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:47,100
Guest: and So like I I really really dug that and I that's when I Think I mean, I can't tell you when it actually formed in my head.

374
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:54,219
Guest: but like I knew for a while there that I was like I'm going to publish a game on a record album and I you know, which one?

375
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,500
Guest: and Like what artist can I get like?

376
00:34:58,782 --> 00:35:00,430
Guest: and so that's what made me.

377
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:05,670
Guest: I was like, I'm gonna do wolf spell and Have shell do the art for it.

378
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:12,966
Guest: and then was up in Canada at a convention where Shell happened to be at as well and we were.

379
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:23,087
Guest: we were hanging out in a cafe afterwards talking about this and They just pulled out the notepad and sketched out this Mountain wolf.

380
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,293
Guest: that's on the cover, right?

381
00:35:24,313 --> 00:35:25,639
Guest: This is this cover is.

382
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:29,383
Guest: It's a trifold.

383
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:45,769
Guest: so it's got these three panels and if you go from the left to the right You've got a bunch of adventurers Out on a mountain and then you have a bunch of wolves out on the mountain and then the mountain itself Turns out to be the back of a giant wolf.

384
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,752
Guest: and it was just.

385
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:58,984
Guest: I was like, oh, yeah More than I saw the last time I looked at this there are so many hidden wolves on this cover In and of itself.

386
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:03,217
Scott: Oh, man, they're definitely seeing at least three hidden wolves.

387
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:04,180
Scott: I didn't see previously.

388
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,446
Rym: Okay, it's not like we gotta back up.

389
00:36:07,547 --> 00:36:09,694
Rym: I bro why an album cover?

390
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,200
Rym: how long you been stewing on that idea?

391
00:36:12,122 --> 00:36:12,945
Guest: Oh, I like.

392
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:15,737
Guest: I've been stewing on that one for for a while.

393
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:25,789
Guest: I the Originally, I wanted to do swords without master in that format like I was gonna have it like a book.

394
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:36,740
Guest: that was a 12 by 12 book until like I Talked to actual printers and they were like, yeah Here's the vast amounts of gold you will need to accomplish.

395
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:52,048
Guest: Okay, yeah so and The I think in 2010 2010 or 11 somewhere in there.

396
00:36:52,068 --> 00:37:01,206
Guest: I I had done a preview of Swords That I had public that like this.

397
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,630
Guest: it's so bad.

398
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,492
Guest: it's so bad.

399
00:37:04,595 --> 00:37:05,677
Guest: I did the cover art myself.

400
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:06,559
Guest: it is not good.

401
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:09,185
Guest: There was interior art.

402
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:09,607
Guest: that's great.

403
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:18,951
Guest: Like I paid actual artists to do some great interior art and I printed that as a square Album, I know it wasn't.

404
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:20,260
Guest: I don't believe it was album size.

405
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,581
Guest: I was.

406
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:28,327
Guest: it would think it was like a more reasonable like nine by nine or something that like Printers could do and it wasn't.

407
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:31,158
Guest: you know, I think I'd be surprised if it was 16 pages.

408
00:37:32,222 --> 00:37:32,584
Guest: It was.

409
00:37:32,604 --> 00:37:47,100
Guest: it was pretty small that I took to GenCon to kind of show off and whatnot and said I'll have this done in a moment and it took me Five years, I guess is that moment to put it out in issue three.

410
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:55,805
Guest: The other thing about worlds is that the worlds without master created an excuse for me to publish games that I otherwise was like.

411
00:37:56,488 --> 00:38:03,269
Guest: I need to make this a beautiful game and then you know The perfect being the enemy of done, you know that kind of thing.

412
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:04,372
Guest: So yeah worlds.

413
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:07,120
Guest: It was like why don't you publish it here?

414
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:25,930
Guest: So When it came around to it I thought well wolf spell is about the size and I went looking online to find like places that that make these album covers and downloading their layouts and throwing it in and it did it fit like I didn't have to like Also write a booklet that I'd have to hand insert.

415
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,498
Guest: cuz like again all of that stuff ends up.

416
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:40,259
Guest: It's just more and more money and more and more, you know either I have to hand insert them or I have to pay someone to do it or Yeah, it just gets out of control.

417
00:38:42,182 --> 00:38:46,075
Guest: And then I thought this is gonna be my first Kickstarter.

418
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:48,986
Guest: I wanted to make Like.

419
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,117
Guest: I had the game already written.

420
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:54,211
Guest: I Was gonna do some rewrites and do some editing passes.

421
00:38:54,693 --> 00:39:04,720
Guest: I did like thousands of editing passes And I wanted to like get this gorgeous art for it, but then otherwise is a pretty straightforward Kickstarter.

422
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:09,718
Guest: I didn't want to do anything complicated with a lot of stretch goals or you know, like.

423
00:39:11,402 --> 00:39:12,767
Guest: I didn't want a lot of moving parts.

424
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:14,995
Guest: So I was like, here's the thing.

425
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:16,219
Guest: That's it.

426
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:21,313
Guest: This is what I need to fund it and let's go no stretch goal of.

427
00:39:21,353 --> 00:39:24,121
Rym: here's a vinyl of me reading the rules to you Right.

428
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:30,949
Guest: A lot of people wanted a record and I had to keep telling people I'm a game designer not a record producer like.

429
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,285
Guest: I'm not Like.

430
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:35,110
Guest: I'm going for the aesthetic and then like.

431
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:38,840
Guest: so now there's a. there's a. it's not a game it's an adventure.

432
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,244
Guest: Oh I'm gonna look this up.

433
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:46,215
Guest: I think it's like death jungle robot.

434
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,229
Scott: I Haven't heard of it.

435
00:39:49,863 --> 00:39:50,826
Guest: Death robot jungle.

436
00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:52,752
Guest: I had them in the wrong order.

437
00:39:52,772 --> 00:40:02,062
Guest: Okay, and this is a Adventure thing Setting it.

438
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:04,251
Guest: so it's a. it's an album cover.

439
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:05,375
Guest: it comes with vinyl.

440
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,440
Guest: it comes with its own music.

441
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:09,170
Guest: So they like it's this whole thing plus an album.

442
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:11,779
Guest: So I just wanted to give a shout out to them.

443
00:40:13,103 --> 00:40:14,716
Guest: I should get a hold of that game at some point.

444
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:16,887
Scott: Maybe I should too.

445
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:18,554
Scott: Yeah, I guess I don't have.

446
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:19,820
Scott: I don't have a turntable.

447
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:23,108
Guest: Yeah, that's that was that was it for me too.

448
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:26,240
Guest: Like I don't Like.

449
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:28,872
Guest: The other thing is like.

450
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:29,277
Guest: how do you?

451
00:40:30,323 --> 00:40:39,698
Guest: Like I would have loved to have had like a bunch of bands that I enjoy on here but also like Yeah, it's just a whole lot of more work.

452
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:47,300
Guest: and Like I said, I am not not a record producer and nor nor should anyone be subject to my taste in music.

453
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:50,722
Guest: Like.

454
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:52,792
Rym: actually that's that's a fun aside question.

455
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:54,299
Rym: No, what kind of music do you like?

456
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,769
Guest: Yeah, uh, well, I mean like.

457
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,413
Guest: I'm into metal.

458
00:40:57,594 --> 00:40:58,439
Guest: I'm into prog rock.

459
00:40:59,082 --> 00:40:59,644
Guest: I'm into.

460
00:41:00,326 --> 00:41:32,219
Guest: I do enjoy quite a bit of music of you know Different varieties and whatnot like but this cover is because like for me Metal and you know the the Old prog rock albums and things like that that hit my life the same time that role-playing games did right like the mind expanding drugs of Black Sabbath and you know Fantasy role-playing games all at once.

461
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:37,220
Guest: So they were intrinsically connected in my brain.

462
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:58,114
Guest: so that was I guess the the reason why I wanted to do like an album cover because I you know have these old albums and just spend hours staring at the cover while listening to the music and I wanted to kind of Pay homage to that experience if if not recreate it So clearly,

463
00:41:58,134 --> 00:42:02,447
Scott: you know the fact that I have this game and I've played it right indicates the Kickstarter is long over.

464
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:08,424
Scott: Yes If somebody out there listening wants to get this game, right?

465
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,186
Scott: How would they?

466
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:10,510
Scott: would they do that today?

467
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,979
Scott: starter an option.

468
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:19,067
Guest: the easiest Way would be to go to worlds without master.

469
00:42:19,368 --> 00:42:24,061
Guest: calm Worlds is plural and master is singular.

470
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:41,757
Guest: Don't when you make URLs Don't do what epi did and There's that's where you can get all the back issues in the magazine, but also I'm selling both the PDF and the Physical copy of this.

471
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,728
Guest: all I ask is that you're patient with me.

472
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:50,165
Guest: shipping these days is Nightmare.

473
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:59,527
Guest: Yeah, yeah And and if you buy if you buy the physical copy, I will send you the PDFs as well.

474
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:16,778
Guest: So Because yeah For the longest time I had sworn off physical games and just did PDFs and then I was like, let's get into this physical game thing the moment a pandemic hits and then I don't like it.

475
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:23,205
Guest: It's like a Everything just kind of started falling apart right then and there when it seemed like here we go.

476
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,469
Guest: We're about ready to publish.

477
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:28,089
Scott: Yeah, I too was played starting things when pandemic hit.

478
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:32,042
Scott: this They're probably not gonna have until next year.

479
00:43:32,062 --> 00:43:34,652
Scott: yeah at the earliest It's.

480
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:39,489
Scott: I actually want to talk about something else unrelated because I follow you on Twitter for a long time, right?

481
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,744
Scott: It was a period where you're tweeting a lot of calculators.

482
00:43:42,905 --> 00:43:43,930
Scott: Oh, yeah, right?

483
00:43:44,452 --> 00:43:57,840
Guest: So so what's up with the calculator, yeah, so this is this is a All right Dread Exists because a long long time ago.

484
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:05,570
Guest: I was like the problem with role-playing games is there's too much math and that That really is an oversimplification of how that happened.

485
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:09,062
Guest: But anyways, the point is is that I used to think that I hate it math.

486
00:44:09,303 --> 00:44:19,588
Guest: Like I went to college and Got my degree in English with the emphasis in creative writing because I was like, I'm not gonna touch math I'm gonna have anything to do with math.

487
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:29,016
Guest: And then that led to making role-playing games which led to a small business, which means you got to learn math And you got to do accounting.

488
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:39,481
Guest: and so I started taking some courses In accounting to kind of get an understanding of what's going on financially speaking with the business.

489
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:43,290
Guest: and There is this calculator.

490
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,367
Guest: It's called the HP 12 C. It came out in the 80s.

491
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:56,939
Guest: it is still kind of considered the standard financial calculator and It's one of those things.

492
00:44:56,999 --> 00:45:03,628
Guest: It's one of those moments in history when like the technology hit the right group of people at the right time.

493
00:45:03,648 --> 00:45:11,655
Guest: and When you look into what this calculator can do with the memory it has and everything else All the technical details.

494
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:13,259
Guest: It's it's astounding.

495
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:23,016
Guest: It's one of those like just well-crafted pieces of Technology and it's part of a Line of calculators.

496
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:33,950
Guest: There's like a scientific one the HP 15 C which the fight and 12 C is a financial calculator, which does like Do your mortgage on it or you know that kind of thing?

497
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:45,310
Guest: The 15 C is gonna help you with your trigonometry and and do like in Integrals and things like that, but it doesn't work like most people think of a calculator.

498
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:50,347
Guest: It uses what's called RPN, which is this reverse polish notation.

499
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:51,110
Guest: That's what it stands for.

500
00:45:52,612 --> 00:46:03,552
Guest: And in a normal calculator situation, you'd be like two Plus three equals and this one is to enter three plus You.

501
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:12,309
Guest: basically you have this stack and you put your numbers on the stack and then you decide the Operations that you're going to do to the two lowest numbers on the stack and you just kind of go through it that way.

502
00:46:14,157 --> 00:46:21,716
Guest: I cannot Truly describe what happened in my brain when I tried that but it was like.

503
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:24,108
Guest: this is how I've always thought of math.

504
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:26,748
Guest: and This is this is different.

505
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:33,134
Guest: And the other thing about these calculators is that they're programmable as like keystroke Programmable like.

506
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,629
Guest: you can get it to remember the key order that you've typed things in.

507
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:47,830
Guest: So you could you could well you can program it to do like a bunch of interesting things, but it had these great creative constraints right like it's just you know, you weren't able to like.

508
00:46:49,054 --> 00:46:56,070
Guest: it's not programmable like a More like your computer is or you know, it's not like it's got a Java running on it or anything like that.

509
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:19,546
Guest: it's just these keystrokes and so that set of creative constraints And just enough keys on it that were a mystery to me Like I didn't at the time didn't know what a natural logarithm was or why it was important or why it was considered natural and the fact that it like Came at math at a slightly different way, but a way that made kind of sense to me.

510
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:21,214
Guest: I Shouldn't say math.

511
00:47:21,234 --> 00:47:23,648
Guest: I should say calculations because that's what it does.

512
00:47:24,573 --> 00:47:27,309
Guest: Just triggered something and I just started learning math.

513
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:33,829
Guest: Okay, just we know we have near where we live here there's in fact actually it's the.

514
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:44,349
Guest: The distributor for wolf spell is a used bookstore And they basically do most of their sales online, especially nowadays.

515
00:47:45,652 --> 00:48:14,307
Guest: But they they bring in a ton of but literally a ton of books from like charity shops and Goodwills and things like that sort them through figure out what what they can sell online and then they put the rest out in these Giant bins out in front of the store and they have like a little Box that says that you know the cash register of truth 50 cents a book and it's just 24 hours a day.

516
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:21,203
Guest: And you just walk by these giant bins and just dig through it like little Book raccoons, right?

517
00:48:21,243 --> 00:48:29,670
Guest: You're just like Tearing into them and it it is on a regular walk that Emma and I do for our house.

518
00:48:32,457 --> 00:48:33,566
Guest: You can see us late at night.

519
00:48:33,627 --> 00:48:38,915
Guest: sometimes we're just out for a nice lovely evening stroll and we have our cell phones out for light.

520
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:47,300
Guest: as we're digging through these things and I was I was like dropping a Dollar or two here to bring home math textbooks, right?

521
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,366
Guest: Like what is happening to me?

522
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:52,706
Guest: Something is broken and it's just.

523
00:48:55,133 --> 00:49:02,543
Guest: It just kind of opened the door and allowed me to see that like a lot of what's happening happens in mathematics is Just a game.

524
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:05,354
Guest: It's just People playing with things.

525
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:10,850
Guest: we kind of get treated as like this super important thing because it does allow for these amazing.

526
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:18,418
Guest: you know all the technology we're using right now and It's obviously on the financial side.

527
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:25,661
Guest: It's I have some qualms about that.

528
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:41,230
Guest: But anyways, the point is yeah But anyway, it's it's it's this very powerful force, but when you get down to it when you talk to actual mathematicians they are They're gamers, right?

529
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:47,990
Guest: They're just like a lot of the the high-end mathematics is like what if the rules are this what would happen?

530
00:49:48,592 --> 00:49:52,477
Guest: and it just played into That.

531
00:49:52,903 --> 00:50:04,939
Guest: that same Thing that drew me to designing role-playing games in the first place and some of these old math not textbooks, but the well some of the textbooks as well, actually the really old textbooks are really neat.

532
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:17,469
Guest: but the The manuals for these calculators from the 70s and the 80s are kind of neat like I actually Did I bought a compilation of like hundreds of them?

533
00:50:19,487 --> 00:50:28,489
Guest: And Just sometimes we'll pull one up on my phone and just read through it to see what a calculator can do like this particular calculator from this particular time.

534
00:50:30,384 --> 00:50:37,870
Guest: it's a You know, it's one of those I can go on forever and I apologize but like no we asked the question because we're fascinated by this.

535
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:40,626
Scott: I was like, I was like, let me throw out a little bait here.

536
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:41,210
Scott: Oh, I caught the.

537
00:50:43,932 --> 00:50:45,285
Guest: There's a. there's a calculator the.

538
00:50:47,457 --> 00:50:48,609
Guest: It's another HP HP.

539
00:50:49,911 --> 00:51:12,386
Guest: particularly in the 70s and 80s and 90s they did a lot of the reverse polish notation stuff and I have like actual feelings about What happened to make Texas instrument the bass calculator for everyone like actual angry feelings that I shouldn't have.

540
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:15,737
Guest: like I'm angry about a thing that.

541
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:18,428
Guest: but anyways, the point is there's.

542
00:51:21,073 --> 00:51:26,475
Guest: There's one the HP 41.

543
00:51:26,475 --> 00:51:30,227
Guest: I'm gonna bring this up to make sure I'm not telling lies about this.

544
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:38,067
Scott: There's a bunch of different Versions of this one, but it's the one with magnetic card reader and thermal printer.

545
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:41,440
Rym: Yes I'm looking at the same Wikipedia page you are.

546
00:51:41,821 --> 00:51:44,050
Rym: Yeah, and I see the heading use on space shuttle.

547
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,036
Rym: So there's something interesting going on here.

548
00:51:46,056 --> 00:51:50,510
Guest: Yeah, like they would go up into space with these to double-check their.

549
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:57,280
Guest: The astronauts would bring them into space so that they would have something to double-check the computers on like these were.

550
00:51:58,812 --> 00:52:00,680
Guest: But what's really interesting about these?

551
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,323
Guest: these came out.

552
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,880
Guest: they were long Lived for a calculator.

553
00:52:05,362 --> 00:52:06,186
Guest: they had some.

554
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:27,216
Guest: The I think they advertise is the alphanumeric revolution because the the The display it was still like that's Segmented display, but it allowed for it had more segments so you can have a rudimentary English alphabet on it and Again, you could program it.

555
00:52:27,557 --> 00:52:30,870
Guest: they had magnetic card readers so you can save those programs.

556
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:38,110
Guest: They had a pen that was a barcode reader so you could actually print out a barcode of the program.

557
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,545
Guest: photocopy that into little calculator.

558
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:42,149
Guest: zines.

559
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:44,439
Guest: share them at conventions.

560
00:52:44,499 --> 00:52:45,944
Guest: Oh snap someone else.

561
00:52:46,025 --> 00:52:46,727
Guest: scan that in.

562
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:50,735
Guest: like if Cellphones didn't happen.

563
00:52:50,755 --> 00:52:56,210
Guest: It could have been this right like this could have been the thing that everyone had in their pocket that they were.

564
00:52:56,551 --> 00:52:59,625
Scott: You know, I mean that's like the gameboy had the e-reader thing, right?

565
00:52:59,725 --> 00:53:02,299
Scott: Yeah, it's like the it's.

566
00:53:02,603 --> 00:53:04,574
Guest: it's like There was.

567
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:06,123
Guest: there was a whole culture to it.

568
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,349
Guest: like a part of that.

569
00:53:07,691 --> 00:53:25,408
Guest: you know 800 document thing that I have has a whole bunch of these scenes that are just like sometimes they're just handwritten instructions to program your calculator to do things and all of those are windows into either other fields like they.

570
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:39,480
Guest: like Uh surveyors have all sorts of programs lots of programs for if you're in if you're a pilot, you know Aerial navigation and whatnot.

571
00:53:40,022 --> 00:53:51,868
Guest: lots of astronomy programs but also just like yeah, just like Hobbies that math intensive hobbies that people had and then games like people programmed games for these things.

572
00:53:52,089 --> 00:53:56,375
Guest: They weren't fancy Like.

573
00:53:56,977 --> 00:54:05,927
Guest: and then the the they figured out that And I'm really gonna mess up how this works because I never had a physical one.

574
00:54:05,947 --> 00:54:09,739
Guest: So I don't know I've played with the apps of it or whatever.

575
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:43,084
Guest: but like there were ways to Directly address some of the memory in the calculator so you could go beyond what the calculator was actually capable of and you can do like Hacking with it so you could get it to like you could make it Overclock it and all these other things that like it just really was this whole universe that I missed out on partly because I'm a little too young like but like even.

576
00:54:44,711 --> 00:55:02,744
Guest: I've now since in my old age bought calculators that existed when I was in high school that if I had this in my mind I would probably be like an engineer now or or Something in that direction rather than the direction I ended up going.

577
00:55:02,964 --> 00:55:04,310
Guest: I don't have regrets about that.

578
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:15,367
Guest: I really enjoy what I'm doing but like it's it is it is so weird to have come at it so much later in life and been like what the hell were they teaching me like.

579
00:55:15,388 --> 00:55:20,745
Guest: I Wanted to learn trigonometry like it as a 45 year old.

580
00:55:20,825 --> 00:55:22,130
Guest: I'm trying to figure out trigonometry.

581
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:25,946
Guest: I took a whole year's worth of trigonometry in high school.

582
00:55:26,006 --> 00:55:26,810
Guest: I know I remember.

583
00:55:28,214 --> 00:55:30,787
Guest: I don't remember any of this or caring about any of this.

584
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:34,730
Scott: so Yeah, I feel I have a similar thing with like cameras, right?

585
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:40,670
Scott: It's like I didn't care about photography until much later in life, and I have cameras that are older than me, right?

586
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:48,390
Scott: Yeah, yeah, right I'll read manuals of cameras and like look at old cameras and say like how did they work whoa?

587
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,641
Scott: It's different about this one.

588
00:55:49,823 --> 00:55:50,469
Scott: I can't afford it.

589
00:55:50,530 --> 00:56:01,200
Rym: I won't buy it, but you know it's in that way with like weird old capital markets protocols Just based on my career is gone and everything like oh wow yeah That is the bad guy.

590
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:06,649
Scott: Yeah, that's great All right, okay, so I think we've gone on quite a bit.

591
00:56:07,372 --> 00:56:12,090
Scott: Yeah, is there anything like what's coming next from from Epi land?

592
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:16,219
Rym: If anything or if anything you're willing to share?

593
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,662
Guest: yeah, I've got.

594
00:56:19,206 --> 00:56:28,905
Guest: well, okay, so there I've got several things that are like at that the I'm trying to think of like a way to describe the stage.

595
00:56:29,146 --> 00:56:34,690
Guest: They're on deck They're not like the the thing that I you know I don't have anything that I'm about to knock out of the park.

596
00:56:35,173 --> 00:56:45,090
Guest: There's a game that I was working on going back to Jenga and called it lives it wakes which is a kaiju game.

597
00:56:46,231 --> 00:56:47,334
Guest: Yeah, it's you.

598
00:56:47,655 --> 00:57:09,760
Guest: you would take the Jenga tower, and you divide it up into three towers of different sizes and you would Collectively make characters that either like live in this city that's about to be attacked by this giant monster or are responsible for it in some way or a part of like like a professor or some scientist or something like that.

599
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:20,201
Guest: and then you play out a Godzilla movie right like you and Depending on which character is in the scene it Tells you which towers you can pull from and you take.

600
00:57:20,764 --> 00:57:39,430
Guest: some of them come from like The smallest tower is like the house and that's the family like you have like this family unit or these closely related people and You can take some of the blocks and put them in the other towers so you can Kind of protect some of them because when that tower falls a character associated with that has to die.

601
00:57:40,973 --> 00:57:45,254
Guest: and so you have this whole like Yeah, giant monster.

602
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:46,839
Guest: I want it like for a long time.

603
00:57:46,879 --> 00:57:49,447
Guest: I wanted to get a giant monster one.

604
00:57:49,467 --> 00:58:17,599
Guest: I Really really love all of the Godzilla films for a number of different reasons, but like the the element I wanted to Sort of take in are those Moments, like it's very evident in like the very first Godzilla of each era where it's horrifying to live in a city being attacked by Godzilla right like later on that that Kind of falls out.

605
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,450
Guest: Although it shows up again in some of them.

606
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,942
Guest: But like there's that that first one where it's like yeah.

607
00:58:23,062 --> 00:58:25,230
Guest: Anyways, it's it's horrifying for that to have happen.

608
00:58:26,394 --> 00:58:35,885
Guest: Play into that but not obviously I wanted to also allow for all of the Sort of can't be stuff that happens in it, but it's a Jenga base game.

609
00:58:36,206 --> 00:58:37,269
Guest: So I'm going to wait a while.

610
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:38,717
Guest: I'm gonna wait till.

611
00:58:38,737 --> 00:58:40,487
Guest: yeah meet face to face.

612
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:44,021
Rym: We will spell over a discord.

613
00:58:44,141 --> 00:58:46,050
Rym: pretty well, but that would be a lot harder.

614
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:57,585
Guest: So the games I'm focusing on now, I have two games that are Sort of in my mind they're they're descendants of swords of that master.

615
00:58:58,407 --> 00:59:02,132
Guest: one of them is a You.

616
00:59:02,493 --> 00:59:07,747
Guest: it's called the game feel public library curious research society and you play a bunch of people.

617
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:11,265
Guest: the characters by The rules of the game have to be at least 45 years old.

618
00:59:12,975 --> 00:59:20,110
Guest: They meet at a library once a month To investigate the weird goings-on in their town.

619
00:59:20,331 --> 00:59:24,946
Guest: So you have like a town that you have and they're like old scooby-doo people.

620
00:59:24,966 --> 00:59:29,693
Guest: Yeah in you Roll these dice.

621
00:59:30,295 --> 00:59:36,310
Guest: one of the die will tell you if your hypothesis is contradicted by what happens in the narration.

622
00:59:37,351 --> 00:59:54,657
Guest: Another one will tell you if somebody suffers the peril of what's happening and it's inspired a lot by 90s horror television like Friday 13th the series or American Gothic and X-Files and American Gothic.

623
00:59:54,737 --> 00:59:55,661
Rym: that's a name.

624
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:56,746
Rym: I haven't heard in a long.

625
00:59:56,786 --> 01:00:00,141
Rym: Yeah, I Was weirdly obsessed with that show.

626
01:00:01,148 --> 01:00:02,947
Guest: I mean What's his name?

627
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:07,521
Guest: Gary Cole as the sheriff who is probably the devil.

628
01:00:07,681 --> 01:00:09,346
Guest: Yeah is so good.

629
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:24,827
Guest: So good Yeah, and then the other one that I'm doing is my Robin Hood game Which I've been working on for quite a while that Finally made a whole lot of headway on it.

630
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:44,682
Guest: then Again, it'll it'll be a bit like Swords of that Master except instead of rolling tone dice You have three coins a bold a sly and a stout coin and you throw those and somebody in your narration Has to have that attribute of like whichever ones came up heads.

631
01:00:44,963 --> 01:00:47,230
Guest: So you have to be like, this is a bold character.

632
01:00:47,594 --> 01:00:51,077
Guest: this is a sly one and open to interpretation.

633
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:51,680
Guest: so you could be like.

634
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:56,337
Guest: he's not bold he's full-hearty or She's not stout.

635
01:00:56,397 --> 01:00:58,907
Guest: She's just very stubborn, you know that kind of thing.

636
01:00:59,369 --> 01:01:01,119
Scott: So Very good.

637
01:01:01,806 --> 01:01:07,190
Scott: All right Is there anything else that you would like to tell us or our listeners?

638
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,400
Scott: That I didn't think of?

639
01:01:09,827 --> 01:01:14,292
Guest: no We've covered the gamut Calculators.

640
01:01:14,735 --> 01:01:16,104
Rym: Yeah, this is a great time.

641
01:01:16,184 --> 01:01:20,158
Rym: Thanks so much for coming Because we had a lot of fun with wolf spell.

642
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:24,856
Rym: it was cool to sort of hear your thoughts on where it came from And sort of why it was crafted the way it was.

643
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:28,450
Rym: and I think I'm gonna read all these Wikipedia articles on calculators tonight.

644
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,438
Guest: Oh, yeah, that's the.

645
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,205
Rym: I've got five tabs open.

646
01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:39,006
Guest: I had to stop myself from Every time somebody's like hey, did you know that people are really into sundials?

647
01:01:39,307 --> 01:01:40,150
Guest: I'm like, I don't need to know.

648
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:46,270
Guest: Oh no Am I gonna be into sundials?

649
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:56,626
Scott: I hope you have a wonderful or as wonderful as possible Yeah weekend and I hope to see you at a convention whenever those exist again.
