1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,718
Rym: It's Monday, October 31st, 2016.

2
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:11,019
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:14,610
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,170
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight on literally the 11th anniversary of the launch of GeekNights.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,310
Rym: We're talking about the great DDoS that lasted about a day and Rym missed because I was in Australia.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,249
Scott: That didn't even last a day.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,648
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,266
Rym: So yeah, we've been doing this for 11 years, pretty much non-stop.

9
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:36,270
Rym: It's kind of weird.

10
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,595
Scott: An arbitrary number?

11
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:40,682
Scott: I mean, was it weird the last episode we did?

12
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:42,790
Scott: This episode's only a few days newer than that one.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,348
Rym: No, that wasn't weird, but this is weird.

14
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:46,345
Scott: And the 10th anniversary is also weird.

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,830
Scott: Because an arbitrary number has passed, suddenly weirdness enters.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,610
Rym: Have you ever celebrated a birthday?

17
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:55,810
Scott: What if we used the hexadecimal system instead of the decimal system?

18
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:56,728
Rym: Ah, but we don't.

19
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:00,253
Scott: Would it have been weird when we did Show FFF as opposed to- You know why it's weird?

20
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:04,530
Rym: Because when we started GeekNights in 2005, a bunch of other people also started podcasts.

21
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:08,167
Rym: And most of those people are no longer podcasting.

22
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:08,508
Rym: It is weird.

23
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,010
Scott: What if we were on a different planet that orbited the sun faster or slower, right?

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:19,550
Scott: Just because the Earth went around the sun almost exactly X number of times, right?

25
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:31,810
Scott: Even then, it still would have been weird because pretty much everyone we knew who started a podcast in those early days of podcasting- If GeekNights was on Mars, this would be like our, I don't know, Mars goes around the sun a lot slower and farther.

26
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:33,786
Rym: Have you ever celebrated a birthday?

27
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:34,170
Rym: Ever?

28
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:36,822
Scott: Only when I was small.

29
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:37,850
Scott: Only because I got presents.

30
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,550
Rym: So now you don't celebrate birthdays anymore?

31
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:40,350
Scott: Not really.

32
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:40,695
Rym: No?

33
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:41,189
Rym: Not at all?

34
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:41,567
Scott: No.

35
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,069
Scott: I really don't respect birthdays very much.

36
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:44,735
Rym: All right.

37
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,150
Rym: You ever celebrate a holiday?

38
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,054
Rym: What about MagFest?

39
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:47,839
Rym: That's every year.

40
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:49,730
Rym: You celebrate that once a year.

41
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:51,770
Scott: It's not just some arbitrary number.

42
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,030
Rym: It's just an arbitrary day.

43
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,130
Rym: Arbitrary atoms go to an arbitrary place to move arbitrary wooden cubes around.

44
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,948
Scott: No, not at all.

45
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:01,170
Rym: How is it not arbitrary?

46
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:03,149
Scott: The universe is there, they're arbitrary and meaningless.

47
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:11,270
Scott: Because on a birthday, you're basically having a party and the only reason you're having the party is because some arbitrary thing happened.

48
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,405
Scott: MagFest is like,

49
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:12,548
Scott: "Oh.".

50
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,345
Rym: Yeah, that arbitrary thing being, "I was

51
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:14,729
Rym: born.".

52
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:19,341
Scott: You're not making a reason to party.

53
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:22,629
Scott: You're literally just saying, "Fuck it, it's party time and everybody

54
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:22,930
Scott: parties.".

55
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,652
Rym: What is a party?

56
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:30,870
Rym: but just a miserable arrangement of atoms in an arbitrary configuration caused by the causal chain stretching forth from the Big Bang?

57
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:32,409
Scott: Sure.

58
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,850
Rym: Anyway, it's the 11th anniversary of GeekNights.

59
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:42,670
Rym: And what's funny about this is that if you're a patron of our Patreon where I've been uploading the hitherto unreleased beta episodes of GeekNights.

60
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,568
Scott: So if you're a dumb person.

61
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,748
Rym: So the one I just uploaded was actually pretty- It was very loose with your monies.

62
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,570
Rym: Was actually pretty funny.

63
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:53,270
Rym: I did real- there's a commentary in the upload of the episode.

64
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:58,130
Rym: But one, the episode was actually pretty good, which was weird because most of those things were terrible.

65
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,829
Scott: Wasn't it like episode four or something?

66
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:00,372
Rym: Yeah.

67
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:04,570
Rym: It was also the last time we used the Logitech stick mic ever.

68
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:05,370
Scott: Okay.

69
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:06,909
Rym: At the very, very end of the show.

70
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,510
Scott: So then we went to buy Radio Shack mics?

71
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,149
Rym: We plugged the Radio Shack mic directly into my line in and yelled into it.

72
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:13,775
Rym: And I yelled, "Jack

73
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:14,276
Rym: Thompson."

74
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:16,825
Rym: And then there's a long pause and then you said one word.

75
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,970
Rym: Can you guess what that word was?

76
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:19,850
Scott: Fear?

77
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:20,506
Scott: Penis.

78
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:21,190
Scott: Oh, okay.

79
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,566
Rym: But the funny thing is that the microphone actually sounded way worse at first.

80
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:27,610
Rym: It took us a while still.

81
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,230
Rym: Those microphones were the worst.

82
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:36,730
Rym: But the other really funny thing in that episode was that I started talking about how the Red Wings are having a really good season.

83
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:39,089
Rym: And it was around this time, so pretty early in the season.

84
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,930
Scott: I don't think they won the Stanley Cup.

85
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:47,030
Rym: So this was the year after the lockout and some rules changes.

86
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,926
Rym: So I was making this argument that the old offensive teams are back.

87
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:51,690
Rym: The trap is dead.

88
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:52,980
Rym: You're going to see the Red Wings.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,190
Rym: This is going to be a good year for us.

90
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,450
Rym: You give me this whole long thing about how this is bullshit and I'm being overly optimistic.

91
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,039
Rym: And sure enough, the Red Wings won the president's trophy that year.

92
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,305
Rym: So I was right.

93
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:05,548
Scott: They didn't win the whole thing?

94
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,259
Rym: No, they lost the Stanley Cup.

95
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,569
Rym: Do you remember who won the Stanley Cup then?

96
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:10,128
Scott: Eleven years ago?

97
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,220
Scott: What year was this?

98
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,770
Scott: 2005? 2005, 2006.

99
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,156
Rym: Because there was no 2005 Stanley Cup.

100
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:15,940
Rym: Because of the lockout.

101
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,152
Rym: 2006.

102
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:22,510
Scott: So it was the lockout year and then the next year.

103
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,748
Rym: It's the next year and there were some rules changes as I recall as well.

104
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,558
Scott: So the Red Wings didn't win.

105
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:29,584
Scott: So it wasn't a team in the West.

106
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,756
Rym: Scott, it's the president's trophy.

107
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:34,170
Rym: If you win the president's trophy, you're not going to win the cup guaranteed.

108
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,330
Scott: No, I'm saying it had to be a team in the East because it wasn't the Red Wings who were in the West.

109
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:38,711
Rym: Yup.

110
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:40,279
Rym: It was.

111
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,189
Rym: I think it was the Hurricanes actually.

112
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,018
Scott: It sounds right.

113
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:46,550
Scott: They were good at one point, I remember.

114
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,050
Scott: There was definitely a time where they won and were good for a short period before they got sucky again and stayed sucky.

115
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:54,178
Rym: Oh, I typed 2006 Hurricanes.

116
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:57,390
Rym: It's telling me only about actual Hurricanes and not the hockey team.

117
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,870
Scott: Well, then maybe it's not the right one if that's not what you're about.

118
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:00,671
Rym: NHL.

119
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,690
Rym: Uh, Stanley Cup Finals.

120
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:06,243
Rym: Stanley Cup Finals location.

121
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:07,229
Rym: Stanley game four.

122
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,816
Rym: Rostro's Hurricanes.

123
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,470
Rym: The Hurricanes won the Stanley Cup in 2006.

124
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,303
Rym: But if you Google for 2006 Hurricanes, you do not get this.

125
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:15,850
Rym: You get real Hurricanes.

126
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,670
Scott: You know, the Carolina Hurricanes used to be the Hartford Whalers.

127
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,502
Rym: You know who they were playing against in the final?

128
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:24,030
Rym: The Edmonton Oilers.

129
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:30,650
Scott: I mean, you know, there are only a few NHL teams that were never good, like Arizona.

130
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:31,673
Rym: The Blues.

131
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:32,923
Scott: The Blues are good.

132
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:33,830
Scott: What are you talking about?

133
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,243
Scott: The Blues have been good.

134
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:36,970
Rym: Yes, that is true.

135
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,659
Scott: Recently and also long ago.

136
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,230
Rym: Who has never, never, never been good?

137
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:40,813
Rym: Arizona.

138
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,570
Rym: Have the Sabres ever, they're pretty young, have the Sabres ever been good?

139
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,952
Rym: Yes.

140
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:44,616
Rym: When?

141
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,649
Scott: There was a time where they were good.

142
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,390
Rym: Best Buffalo Sabres season ever.

143
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,475
Rym: Let's see.

144
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:56,030
Rym: List of Buffalo Sabres seasons.

145
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,809
Scott: Yeah, I was going to say, you should just look up the list.

146
00:05:58,592 --> 00:05:59,588
Rym: I'll look this up later.

147
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:03,599
Rym: Lost, lost, lost.

148
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,728
Rym: It looks like they made it to the playoffs a few times.

149
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:06,130
Rym: All right.

150
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:13,510
Rym: Anyway, so, uh, yeah, if you're a patron, you'll get to listen to that beta episode, which is hitherto never been released.

151
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:21,190
Rym: And the other weird thing about it is Scott talks a lot about politics and Karl Rove and how excited he is about Obama and how he's listened to Obama's podcast.

152
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:22,838
Rym: It's a different time.

153
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:24,450
Scott: I don't remember ever listening to Obama's podcast.

154
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,420
Rym: Not only did you listen to Obama's podcast, but you constantly bothered me because I didn't listen to it yet.

155
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,118
Scott: You were like... Well, maybe that'll teach you.

156
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,270
Scott: Everyone should listen to Obama's podcast and you'll realize there's no point.

157
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,390
Rym: I hope Obama starts the podcast up again after he's out of the presidency.

158
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:46,069
Scott: I hope anyone who has ever been a political leader in the world of insignificant power or wealth makes a podcast.

159
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:59,050
Scott: Because notice, right, that in terms of like voices you hear in the public, it's usually not the powerful, intelligent people on earth do not communicate with the general public openly or often.

160
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,030
Rym: Well, you know, it's kind of like how we were only ones.

161
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,810
Scott: The only ones who do that are typically like, you know, assholes and evil people.

162
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,769
Rym: There was a conversation in the forum where we were like, "Yeah, you gotta go to Reddit for like your specialized community

163
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:09,889
Rym: stuff.".

164
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,163
Rym: And people were saying that, "Oh, there's...".

165
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:28,890
Rym: Like, generally it came about that forums about things out there in the world that aren't on Reddit tend to be super provincial and have bad knowledge because anyone who actually has, for reals, professional or semi-professional skill and pretty much anything tends to just do that thing professionally.

166
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,516
Scott: That's mostly true.

167
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:36,650
Scott: However, there are, for certain things on earth, there are certain forums or communities have gathered.

168
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:44,550
Scott: For example, I know that like emergency room staff and like, you know, medical professionals, there's like a secret-ish forum somewhere.

169
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,110
Scott: It may have been a thing of the day once where like...

170
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:47,038
Rym: I was.

171
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,270
Rym: I remember that thing actually.

172
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,993
Scott: Where they gather.

173
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:51,650
Scott: Also magicians, there's some forum for magicians somewhere.

174
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:52,777
Rym: How do you know?

175
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:53,409
Rym: It might be a trick.

176
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,560
Scott: Possibly, but like, you know, magicians and illusionists, there's a community for them.

177
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:08,088
Scott: that's somewhere on the internet that like you have to know to get in some... You know, there's various, there's like a handful of ivory towers out there for certain things, but most things, no.

178
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,810
Rym: So, yeah, I guess that's just how it goes.

179
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,404
Rym: But I do want Obama to start a podcast.

180
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:14,050
Rym: I would listen to that.

181
00:08:14,552 --> 00:08:15,669
Scott: I think he's got better things to do.

182
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:16,855
Rym: I don't know.

183
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:25,470
Rym: There's been some hints just from some interviews I've seen him give recently that he's pretty much just waiting to be out of the White House and then he's going to... I think he said something to the effect of...

184
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,116
Scott: He's still the president.

185
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:26,985
Scott: You can still do stuff.

186
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:27,349
Scott: Do stuff.

187
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,989
Rym: He said something to the effect of, "I'm going to express what I'm actually

188
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:31,210
Rym: thinking.".

189
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:32,621
Scott: All right.

190
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,150
Scott: Go for it.

191
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,683
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

192
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,347
Rym: So, you got any news?

193
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:43,570
Scott: Well, it's Apple Week, so... Usually Apple Day happens like right as we're doing a Monday show, but this time it happened like a few days before.

194
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:43,876
Rym: Yeah.

195
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,849
Scott: But that's okay.

196
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,090
Rym: And right on the heels of that Microsoft Surface workstation whatever announcement.

197
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,290
Scott: It's Surface whatever it's called.

198
00:08:54,556 --> 00:09:06,750
Rym: I would consider buying one of those if it weren't for the fact that I also play games and I want a 1080 instead of a 980M, but that's a pretty solid for real professional workstation there with that monitor.

199
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,284
Scott: It's okay.

200
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:11,670
Rym: I mean, it's hard to get good monitors like that in general.

201
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,138
Scott: The iMac still has a better screen.

202
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:14,930
Scott: The iMac has way more pixels.

203
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,530
Scott: The iMac just has a wider aspect ratio, right?

204
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,269
Rym: That is true.

205
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:29,530
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, Apple announced mostly their MacBook, some useless Apple TV nonsense, but pretty much the MacBook is the news, right?

206
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,590
Scott: So what did they do on the MacBook?

207
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,019
Scott: Everyone was waiting for this, myself included, because like at work, I got a Lenovo like X220.

208
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,890
Scott: It's way old, right?

209
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,030
Scott: But actually there's nothing wrong with it, right?

210
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:46,750
Scott: It's got the built-in Intel video card thing, which is all you need if you're not doing anything 3D ever, which is I'm at work.

211
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:48,030
Scott: I'm using SSH, right?

212
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:51,770
Scott: I don't need Nvidia or ATI, anything, right?

213
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:54,149
Scott: Even like a 1050 is too much for work.

214
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:56,658
Scott: It's got an i7.

215
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:58,287
Scott: It's got SSDs.

216
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:00,424
Scott: It's got, you know, eight gigs of RAM.

217
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:01,230
Scott: I can plug my mouse.

218
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,454
Rym: Eight gigs of RAM.

219
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:05,450
Rym: My laptop from 2009 has eight gigs of RAM.

220
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,790
Scott: That's mostly my problem, right?

221
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,285
Scott: Because I'm using Virtual Box and stuff, I need 16 or 32, but the laptop cannot hold that much.

222
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:12,909
Scott: It's already full.

223
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,630
Scott: So I'm like, well, the new MacBook is coming.

224
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:21,569
Scott: It'll probably be, you know, not only be able to have 16 or 32 gigs of RAM, but will be way better than this.

225
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:24,750
Scott: And I can just switch to that and it'll be fine.

226
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:30,530
Rym: But no, the general consensus is that the new MacBooks are not significantly more powerful than the old MacBooks.

227
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,950
Scott: No, I mean, that was the big thing, right?

228
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,790
Scott: Is they did a bunch of usual controversial Apple stuff, right?

229
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,890
Scott: They got rid of all the ports except for four USB-C/Thunderbolt ports.

230
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:44,410
Rym: Which, as many people have already pointed out, four is not enough for the average professional in a creative space.

231
00:10:44,730 --> 00:11:00,530
Scott: Right, so if you're the kind of person who's just taking this thing and walking around town with it, right, that's not really a big deal because, like, yeah, you're going to need a dongle to, like, connect your iPhone to it or, you know, whatever, but you're not really going to plug to or dongle to connect your SD card from your camera.

232
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:04,610
Scott: But really, you're not going to do too much of that if you're really using it as a notebook.

233
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:12,230
Scott: But if you're using it at a desk, which a lot of people do, you know, they take their MacBook to work, it's at a desk most of the time plugged into stuff.

234
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,310
Scott: They even showed, demoed and promoted LG making this monitor.

235
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:25,909
Scott: because, again, if they truly have given up on making standalone cinema displays, even though they're stupid, if they sold 5K cinema displays, I would pay a lot of money, I would just buy them.

236
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:30,810
Scott: Even for a thousand dollars, people would buy them, but I guess they're saying buy LG's monitor instead.

237
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:38,029
Scott: So they're showing you that you should take the MacBook and sit down at a desk with this LG monitor plugged into it.

238
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:44,050
Scott: But then, in the picture they show promoting this, you see just, like, a MacBook next to this monitor.

239
00:11:44,432 --> 00:11:52,430
Scott: They're not showing you the reality, which is you're going to have 10 million dongles in, like, a hub and all this crazy stuff connected to it in this big mess, right?

240
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,930
Scott: They concentrate so much on making the device itself have less holes and be elegant.

241
00:11:58,232 --> 00:12:08,490
Scott: But in real life, what ends up happening is if you have a PC that has a million crazy holes in the back where it's ugly, you have neatly placed wires in the back and nothing in the front.

242
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:20,242
Scott: And your desk actually looks, as a whole, ends up looking more beautiful than it does if you have a Mac and some sort of, you know, jungle of snakes and dongles all over the place.

243
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:21,810
Scott: But anyway, Apple has always done that.

244
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,577
Scott: They just did it more extreme.

245
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,370
Scott: And that's really what this MacBook is about.

246
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:33,990
Scott: It's the trend that Apple has always had for the past X years, according to the Mac, but taken to the extreme, right?

247
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,510
Scott: They've always overcharged you for RAM and storage compared to, like, just buying it from Newegg.

248
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,559
Scott: But now, it's even worse.

249
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:53,130
Scott: We've waited so long between this MacBook and the last MacBook, the biggest gap, yet it was the smallest incremental upgrade, the biggest price increase, right?

250
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,150
Rym: Yeah, for the cost of an upper-end one of these, I could build a goddamn supercomputer.

251
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,708
Scott: So, I went and I'm like, "Maybe I can convince IT to let me just build a

252
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:02,070
Scott: computer.".

253
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,157
Scott: And I went on Newegg and I'm like-- That's what I did in my office.

254
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,630
Rym: I built a thousand dollar computer at work.

255
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,469
Rym: It's a tiny god.

256
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,508
Scott: I went on Newegg and I'm like, "All right, can I make a work

257
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:09,930
Scott: computer?".

258
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,730
Scott: I'm like, "Okay, work computer doesn't need a video card.

259
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:13,115
Scott: I need the tiniest case.

260
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:16,910
Scott: I need an ITX motherboard with an Intel built-in whatever, right?

261
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,930
Scott: The i5 that has the Intel built-in video card thing, right?

262
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:25,088
Scott: I need a power supply that fits in the tiny case, 32 gigs of RAM, an SSD.

263
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:28,294
Scott: That's it?

264
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:30,370
Scott: I don't think I need anything else, right?

265
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,425
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I work-- A case, a power supply, a CPU.

266
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,407
Rym: I need virtualization because I run a whole bunch of VMs.

267
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,830
Scott: Case, power supply, CPU, one drive, RAM sticks.

268
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,290
Rym: Yeah.

269
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:41,570
Scott: Did I forget anything?

270
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:54,410
Scott: No, for my-- I guess I could put a really-- If I really wanted to, I could spend like $150 and put the weakest Nvidia 1050 video card in there just because it's going to be so cheap.

271
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,950
Scott: So I did this and it only costs like $1100.

272
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,669
Scott: And it's basically a god-- But it's not thin.

273
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:04,480
Scott: It was actually crazy thin.

274
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:05,529
Scott: It's not as thin as a MacBook.

275
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,210
Rym: Yeah.

276
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,163
Scott: But it was crazy thin.

277
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:10,650
Scott: It was the tiniest case I could find.

278
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,770
Scott: It has a special something SX power supply that's really thin and modular and whatever.

279
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:23,223
Rym: I mean, I don't even know who tweeted it, but they said something like, "The MacBook is revolutionary as a 2012 era gaming

280
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:23,464
Rym: laptop.".

281
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:27,409
Scott: Yeah, pretty much, right?

282
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:34,227
Scott: It's like they don't realize that like, "Hey, sure, the Mac is only 10% of your business

283
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:34,307
Scott: now.".

284
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:40,670
Scott: But you haven't updated your stupid black Mac Pro trash can since you announced it.

285
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,309
Rym: Yup, and that thing was underpowered when it was launched.

286
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:45,162
Scott: And you're selling it for $5,000, right?

287
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:47,532
Rym: Yeah.

288
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:55,210
Rym: You said for $5,000, I wouldn't even know what to spend the last like 800 bucks on building a computer.

289
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:58,850
Scott: I already got four 1080s in here, but I don't know.

290
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,549
Rym: That's already like a raid of SSDs inside of it, like two terabyte SSDs.

291
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:09,370
Scott: I've said this and you can go back to old GeekNights and I'll be saying the same thing.

292
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,459
Scott: Why don't they just do X?

293
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,270
Scott: They would destroy the entire industry.

294
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:17,610
Scott: And X is either A, they could just let you sideload apps on the iPhone.

295
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,150
Scott: Android would die immediately.

296
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,682
Scott: It would just be like, "Oh, why use Android now?

297
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:21,670
Scott: The iPhone is now open.

298
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,649
Scott: We can install any, we can make any software and avoid the app store game

299
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:24,870
Scott: over.".

300
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,050
Scott: It would just, right?

301
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,170
Scott: It's like, sure, they'd make a little less money selling apps in the app store, but who gives a shit?

302
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,470
Scott: Your competition would be gone.

303
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:39,070
Scott: Every person with an Android phone, when those phones got old, would buy an iPhone because there's no other choice.

304
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,090
Rym: Half the market for Android phones is people who want to spend like 100 bucks on a phone.

305
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,987
Scott: Yeah, you can get the iPhone SE.

306
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,080
Rym: That's more than 100 bucks.

307
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,632
Scott: Not the old one.

308
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:53,865
Scott: Anyway, the other thing they could do is just make a Mac.

309
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:55,670
Scott: that's like godly, right?

310
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,330
Scott: You could even charge more for it, right?

311
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,436
Scott: You could sell $3,000 worth of hardware for $4,000 or $4,500, right?

312
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,410
Scott: And if it was actually high spec, people wouldn't be complaining.

313
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:20,681
Scott: If you put a fucking 1080 in there with your 5K screen and 32 gigs of RAM and the best i7 and just max it the fuck out, no one's gonna be like, "Oh,

314
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,030
Scott: $4,000.".

315
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,085
Scott: They're gonna be like, "Well, okay, this would normally be $3,000 if I bought it and built a

316
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:26,146
Scott: PC.".

317
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:33,150
Scott: But I'm getting it as a Mac with its amazing engineering and its Apple care and all that stuff.

318
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:36,870
Scott: It still has the best screen and the best touchpad, right?

319
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:51,230
Rym: The people who actually care about using this in a professional capacity, only a tiny percentage of them, because this is already a tiny percentage of the market, only a tiny percentage of the people who even buy a MacBook actually need even a baby powerful computer.

320
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,470
Rym: They don't use it for anything except checking their email and maybe some light Photoshop or whatever.

321
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,670
Scott: That's not the Mac Pro, right?

322
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,569
Scott: If you're just doing the light email, you get the iPad, right?

323
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,770
Rym: Nah, usually those people, corporations are very unwilling to buy iPads for their employees.

324
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:08,109
Rym: They still want a computer.

325
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:16,910
Scott: If you watch the presentation, they are promoting this as something you would, you know, they don't show people using it to do spreadsheets, right?

326
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:22,930
Scott: They show people using the MacBook Pro to edit videos, to edit photos in a professional capacity, right?

327
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:25,270
Scott: They have Adobe on stage, right?

328
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,369
Scott: This is what the MacBook Pro is for.

329
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,490
Scott: That's why it has the word Pro on it and it's not good enough.

330
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:31,410
Scott: It's a piece of garbage.

331
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,170
Scott: Anyone who actually needs to edit video can't get by with this thing because it's so weak ass, right?

332
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,190
Scott: And it costs more than the alternative.

333
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,990
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying the market is so small of the people who actually use these things for those purposes.

334
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,970
Rym: I think most people who buy MacBook Pros don't actually use that power that they have, as minimal as it is.

335
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:54,809
Scott: But here's what's going to happen is all these people who, you know, now are using Macs, like web developers all use Macs.

336
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:00,310
Scott: The next time it comes around, they're going to be like, well, I guess I'm not getting a Mac just because it's so weak.

337
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,970
Scott: And then when the developers leave, they're going to lose, you know, you can't make it.

338
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:10,670
Scott: People are only going to have like a Mac lying around for when they need to write an iPhone app or something like that.

339
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:15,370
Scott: You know, they're going to lose all the support of the community if people actually make shit.

340
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:21,490
Scott: And that's going to have a negative sort of downwards effect on the rest of everything, right?

341
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:27,910
Rym: At the same time, I feel like a lot of people who buy Macs already don't really understand that much about the Deepin.

342
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,690
Rym: Like they don't know that much about hardware because they bought a Mac already, like a MacBook Pro.

343
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,790
Rym: They've never been the most powerful laptops.

344
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:38,270
Scott: But they've been powerful enough, right?

345
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,450
Scott: So it's like if you bought the last generation MacBook.

346
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,564
Rym: I feel like for web developers whose companies just buy these things for them.

347
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,890
Rym: anyway, this is still powerful.

348
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:51,090
Scott: If you look at the last generation MacBook, it's like, yeah, it was, you know, you could have gotten, you could have always gotten, right?

349
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:59,950
Scott: A better PC for the same money, but it wasn't so much more money and it was still pretty good at the time, right?

350
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,150
Scott: It's like, yeah, OK, that's like a top of the line laptop, basically.

351
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,050
Scott: And you're getting the touch pad in the screen.

352
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:09,930
Scott: So it's like, yeah, you spend a little bit extra money, but you're getting your money's worth ish, losing a bit extra.

353
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:11,576
Scott: And they overcharge you on the RAM.

354
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:15,090
Scott: But hey, it's ECC RAM, which PCs can't even use these days, right?

355
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:20,350
Scott: But now it's just like, wow, you're just pissing away a thousand dollars for nothing.

356
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,996
Rym: Well, it's thin.

357
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:22,883
Rym: That's the thing.

358
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:23,689
Rym: It's super thin.

359
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:31,270
Rym: There's a point at which, you know, it's like, I still much prefer my old Lenovo because while it's not like an inch thick, but you know what?

360
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:33,610
Rym: It's small in every other dimension.

361
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,570
Scott: I like thinness and smallness, right?

362
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,490
Scott: If you get the 13 inch MacBook, it's it's smaller and thinner than your Lenovo.

363
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:39,871
Scott: Right.

364
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:40,392
Scott: Which is great.

365
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:41,494
Scott: I love that part.

366
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:44,842
Scott: But there's a point at which it's like the thinner.

367
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,550
Scott: the extra thinness isn't really any big improvement.

368
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,970
Scott: Right.

369
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:57,930
Scott: It's like I'd rather, you know, the regular the previous MacBook size, even, you know, the first all aluminum unibody MacBook was kind of thick.

370
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,330
Scott: It was like, you know, a little under an inch, maybe, you know, by today's standards, it was thick.

371
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:03,073
Scott: Right.

372
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:04,942
Scott: It's like that's still thin enough.

373
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:06,630
Scott: No one's going to complain about that.

374
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,111
Scott: And if you made it that thick and you loaded it up with like a 10.

375
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:11,352
Scott: Right.

376
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:16,230
Scott: No one's going to give a fuck that it's only three quarters of an inch and not as thin as a sheet of paper.

377
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:24,584
Rym: I think it's just hard for Apple internally to justify investing in the creator side of things much, because that is a relatively small market compared to the.

378
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:27,690
Rym: I just use an iPad and look at shit model.

379
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,670
Rym: iPads are way easier for them to sell.

380
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:30,970
Scott: Right.

381
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:40,710
Scott: Well, what's going to happen is all the people who do creative type things like Photoshop and whatnot will move to PCs and they'll be using like their semi custom sandbenders.

382
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:47,010
Scott: Adobe will stop making like Photoshop for Mac some years, five to, you know, however many years from now.

383
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:47,331
Scott: Right.

384
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,213
Scott: You know, people stop.

385
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:54,150
Scott: all professional creators will stop using it and then they'll won't be tools for the Mac.

386
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,010
Scott: There are all these all the trickle down things that developers and creative people make.

387
00:20:59,431 --> 00:20:59,612
Scott: Right.

388
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:06,010
Scott: Won't be going down to the Mac consumers and the Mac will become a less attractive platform for consumers as well as professional.

389
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:12,150
Rym: Also, I noticed that in certain areas, there's a big overlap between gamers and creatives.

390
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:22,570
Rym: And very few people, I think, are going to get a super expensive Mac for their work life and build a giant gaming PC for the gaming aspect of their life.

391
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,690
Rym: So if you're already a gamer, then you have a super powerful creator workstation at your desktop.

392
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:35,870
Rym: And if you're already a creator who has used as a Mac, you'd have to buy an entirely separate thousand plus dollar computer to play games because no one makes games on Macs anymore.

393
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:39,170
Rym: Because not that many people have Macs anymore who play games.

394
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:45,681
Scott: So, you know, even though initially might only make, you know, a very small number of people upset over the long haul.

395
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:50,269
Scott: if they don't fix it, it's going to hurt the rest of the environment of Apple.

396
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,100
Scott: People who can code aren't buying Macs.

397
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,490
Scott: Therefore, they're not writing software for Macs and iPhones.

398
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:10,970
Rym: Well, we famously, and I had to pay out on a bet because I made a bet publicly on GeekNights as many years ago where we argued that Apple was going to end the actual PC style Macs and move to basically just iPads and like shitbooks.

399
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,632
Rym: And they actually didn't.

400
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:15,379
Rym: And they're still making this stuff.

401
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,190
Rym: But as we've seen here, as this whole news is about, they're barely making them.

402
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,573
Rym: Like a minimum effort.

403
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,058
Scott: Maybe that's intentional.

404
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:27,986
Scott: Maybe they want the Mac to sell.

405
00:22:28,026 --> 00:22:29,970
Scott: So like if they just cut the Mac off.

406
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,150
Scott: Right.

407
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,150
Scott: Like if they just came out the other day and said, all right, no more Macs for not making money on it.

408
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,333
Scott: Such a small part of our business.

409
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:35,714
Scott: Fuck it.

410
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:36,476
Scott: Right.

411
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,686
Scott: Then people would be like crazy up in arms.

412
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:41,090
Scott: But this way they can go.

413
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:47,770
Scott: And so, you know, a year or two from now, I'd be like, look, we try our best investors to update this Mac and get it to sell.

414
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:51,903
Scott: You know, and no one bought it and we're losing money on it.

415
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:54,150
Scott: So now we're justified in ending it.

416
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:59,324
Scott: And people won't be upset because they won't be Mac users anymore to be upset.

417
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:01,430
Scott: Everyone will have abandoned the platform already.

418
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,379
Scott: They have to abandon it first, then they can cut it off.

419
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:05,790
Scott: You can't cut it off and force everyone away from it.

420
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:16,890
Rym: So in other news, just kind of slightly relevant to the main bit today, but attack vectors for devices like phones or computers or your Internet of Things nonsense.

421
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,913
Scott: Isn't this the main bit?

422
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:18,635
Rym: No.

423
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,239
Rym: So there is an attack vector.

424
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:24,090
Rym: I think I've mentioned this offhandedly on a couple of big nights, but we haven't really talked about it in depth.

425
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:29,326
Rym: But there's a lot of apps you can install on your phone that get permission to use your microphone.

426
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:30,349
Rym: You don't think much about it.

427
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:31,893
Scott: I know it was.

428
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:38,650
Scott: if something asked for like GPS, I'm like, I usually just think, do I need this app to know my GPS?

429
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,075
Scott: What is it going to use it for?

430
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:43,429
Scott: For example, I put the Ticketmaster app and it was like, I want to use a GPS.

431
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,177
Scott: And I'm like, oh, you're going to look for concerts like nearby.

432
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:47,240
Scott: All right.

433
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,062
Scott: I don't give a shit.

434
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:48,243
Scott: Right.

435
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:50,930
Scott: But like if you install some other app, like this is a notepad.

436
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,433
Scott: What are you using the GPS for?

437
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:54,077
Scott: No, no, you can't.

438
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:55,661
Rym: It wants access to all your files.

439
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:56,964
Rym: It wants root on the phone.

440
00:23:57,024 --> 00:23:59,049
Scott: In fact, uninstall because you asked.

441
00:23:59,470 --> 00:23:59,670
Scott: Right.

442
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,531
Rym: Of course.

443
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:08,530
Rym: So one interesting attack factor that someone demonstrated a proof of concept for a while ago was that I think accelerometer data is not protected.

444
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,033
Rym: Like any app can get it no matter what.

445
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:10,815
Scott: Yeah, no one gives a shit.

446
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:17,410
Rym: So someone wrote a clever app that can figure out exactly where in New York City you are pretty accurately.

447
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:27,269
Rym: If you use the subway at all, it can figure out based on timing and motion with increasing accuracy the longer you're on the subway, exactly what station you're at.

448
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:28,732
Scott: Interesting.

449
00:24:28,892 --> 00:24:29,213
Scott: Yeah.

450
00:24:29,354 --> 00:24:30,257
Scott: How did they do that?

451
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:34,470
Rym: Because every like different trains and different subways, like there's particular events along the way.

452
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:37,458
Rym: So if you get enough data, you can sort of just do some.

453
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,710
Scott: But I mean, so they so they collected data originally, like they rode the end train back.

454
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,992
Rym: They collected a bunch of data.

455
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:43,293
Scott: Okay.

456
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:49,367
Scott: This is what the vibrations look like on the end train to look for patterns on particular trains, particular stations, particular.

457
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:50,770
Scott: build up the data first.

458
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,812
Scott: You can just do it from nothing.

459
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:59,150
Rym: It's kind of like in Britain, how you can use the hum of the mains in the background to identify the time that a video or some audio was recorded.

460
00:24:59,390 --> 00:24:59,650
Rym: Sure.

461
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:00,451
Rym: Similar thing.

462
00:25:01,072 --> 00:25:01,652
Rym: But I mean, that's just.

463
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:22,470
Rym: that was obviously an academic proof of concept, but basically there's this thing that's been going on for a while where phone apps will listen for sounds in the background that are transmitted subaudibly or inaudibly or high frequency by TVs and screens so that they can figure out like, oh, he's watching the Rangers game right now.

464
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:22,931
Rym: Yeah.

465
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:24,633
Rym: Or he saw this ad.

466
00:25:24,853 --> 00:25:25,053
Scott: Yep.

467
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:29,259
Rym: So that stuff is not because it's all like private companies doing it.

468
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,710
Scott: And other than the number one company that does it is Shazam, which is why if I need to Shazam some song, I install Shazam, do it and uninstall Shazam.

469
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,952
Scott: So that's like the.

470
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,638
Scott: it's the most advertising like thing.

471
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:42,920
Scott: That's how they make all their money.

472
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:47,770
Rym: So there are demonstrable ways to use this as an attack vector.

473
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:59,610
Rym: And there is, as far as this is an article linking some of the basics of this, there seems to be no rigor into the security of the APIs that look at and respond to this, the sound data.

474
00:25:59,770 --> 00:25:59,930
Rym: Yeah.

475
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,975
Scott: You can you say no, you don't have mic permission.

476
00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:02,415
Scott: It's on you.

477
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:03,217
Rym: Yeah.

478
00:26:03,498 --> 00:26:05,321
Rym: But you might be able to do it other ways.

479
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:09,590
Rym: What if, you know, if a webcam is plugged into something, if you get access to sound data.

480
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,492
Scott: Well, unplug my webcam for not using it.

481
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:11,872
Scott: Yeah.

482
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:18,519
Rym: But this is an attack vector that is very poorly understood and basically no one is looking at it.

483
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:28,930
Rym: And it's and apparently there's a lot of moves toward using this kind of communication with Internet of Things type stuff because it's really convenient and just works.

484
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,994
Rym: So this is an attack vector that no one's looking at.

485
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:33,798
Rym: That's probably going to bite us in the butt later.

486
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:35,562
Scott: Just saying bite me in the butt.

487
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,130
Scott: We'll say I get some hidden microphone.

488
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,734
Rym: You might there might be a device that has a microphone.

489
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:42,456
Rym: you don't realize.

490
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:44,400
Scott: Maybe that's you could.

491
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,663
Scott: that would be a real attack vector.

492
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:48,990
Scott: You sell someone hardware that is hardware in it that they don't know is even in it.

493
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:50,573
Rym: Or you sell someone.

494
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:52,176
Rym: I couldn't find the article again.

495
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:57,225
Scott: You don't know your refrigerator has a camera in it because it's so small and it's in like this tiny hole in the door.

496
00:26:57,626 --> 00:26:59,990
Scott: And now they're spying on you and sending video to the Internet.

497
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,550
Rym: Yeah.

498
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:02,255
Rym: Who's going to even bother trying to figure that out?

499
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:02,656
Scott: You know what?

500
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:05,522
Scott: That doesn't even have to be something at the refrigerator manufacturer.

501
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:08,570
Scott: That could be someone in a Best Buy installing those in the fridge doors.

502
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:11,471
Scott: Right.

503
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:12,112
Scott: They could just do it.

504
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:13,774
Rym: So someone demonstrated.

505
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:16,657
Rym: I'm not going to take off the article, but they bought a webcam.

506
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,521
Rym: This happened a couple of times, but there's a really good in-depth story about it.

507
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:24,427
Rym: Someone bought these webcams like set them up in your house for security and they decided they sucked.

508
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,509
Rym: So they returned them.

509
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:26,470
Rym: That's fine.

510
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:32,000
Rym: Then like a couple months later, they got an email that was like activity was detected on webcam number four.

511
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,202
Rym: And they were like, what?

512
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:36,890
Rym: And sure enough, they logged into their account and they could see some other dude's house.

513
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,692
Scott: It was a cloud backed webcam security thing.

514
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:43,616
Scott: Like most of those things are regular old Logitech webcam security cloud one.

515
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:43,916
Rym: Yeah.

516
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:46,718
Rym: Most of those things have problems like that.

517
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:54,785
Rym: Things of the day.

518
00:27:55,045 --> 00:27:59,649
Rym: So it's an annual tradition on Fark and I'm going to link to two of them just for your reference.

519
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:00,390
Scott: Oh, Fark.

520
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:03,877
Rym: I am a big fan of scary stories.

521
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:06,221
Rym: Now I'm not saying that I believe in ghosts.

522
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,950
Rym: I'm saying that ghostly cool stories are really good.

523
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,095
Scott: I like them if they're actual scary like, but that's pretty rare.

524
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:14,656
Scott: Yeah.

525
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:16,820
Scott: Now my best- I like a good ghost story.

526
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,682
Scott: It's just hard to come by.

527
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:22,070
Rym: The best source of pretty good ghost stories- I prefer skeleton story.

528
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:33,190
Rym: Is Fark because every year there's an annual tradition of having a thread where everyone tells scary stories and it's about one third people where something mundane happened to them, but they kind of wigged out for no reason.

529
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:39,941
Rym: One third weird shit where even the person is like, yeah, pretty sure it wasn't ghosts, but it was a weird freaky thing that I still can't explain.

530
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:44,288
Rym: And they tell their story and one third people just writing short fiction.

531
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:45,310
Rym: That's usually pretty good.

532
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,955
Rym: My favorite one of all time is a real story about Fishy.

533
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:52,697
Rym: Basically it was a dude who- That he knows real.

534
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:54,919
Rym: No, so the story is- Just comment on Fark.

535
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,083
Rym: So the story is basically- Is it on Snopes?

536
00:28:58,844 --> 00:29:04,070
Rym: I will read the story to the patrons on Patreon as a spooky story.

537
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,352
Scott: Yeah, don't pay for that.

538
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,093
Scott: Go to Fark and read it.

539
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:08,237
Rym: The story is basically- Or don't?

540
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:08,938
Scott: because who cares?

541
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:13,786
Rym: A kid growing up, he had some mental issues and basically, you know, some kids will have an imaginary friend?

542
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:14,607
Rym: Sure.

543
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:15,809
Rym: So we had an imaginary friend.

544
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,350
Scott: All right.

545
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,634
Rym: And just the way the imaginary friend presented in his life is just really unnerving.

546
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:28,118
Rym: And he just tells the story of like what it was like as a kid, just having this imaginary friend that he kind of couldn't make go away.

547
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:30,239
Rym: And then when he grew up, like one day it disappeared.

548
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:30,920
Rym: That was the end of it.

549
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,883
Rym: But it's just really- It's unnerving in ways that-.

550
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:37,404
Scott: Oh, so the guy who had the imaginary kid is writing the thing.

551
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:38,185
Scott: Yeah, he wrote the thing.

552
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:39,566
Scott: He was like- Or pretending to right now.

553
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:42,127
Rym: He was like, so guys- It's a first person story.

554
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,509
Rym: Yes, this is what it was like for me with Fishy.

555
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:45,630
Rym: Growing up with Fishy.

556
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:53,457
Scott: Okay, so you know how in the olden days, like the 70s and the 80s, comedians would all be like, black men do this, white men do that.

557
00:29:53,737 --> 00:29:54,518
Rym: Yeah, that was the thing.

558
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:56,200
Scott: That was like the Richard Pryor bit, right?

559
00:29:56,881 --> 00:30:00,645
Scott: Now Scott's bit is police men do this, firemen do that.

560
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,847
Rym: That's like my dad when I was a kid.

561
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:05,790
Rym: There's a reason firemen come home to their families happy.

562
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:14,957
Scott: If you go on New York Police Department Twitter, on any given day, you're more than likely to see some post that's like, "There's been an incident.

563
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:16,018
Scott: We shot somebody.

564
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:16,378
Scott: News

565
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:16,819
Scott: coming.".

566
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:25,346
Scott: Well, if you go on Fire Department Twitter, which I only realized was a thing somewhat more recently, it's like, "Hey, we saved someone.

567
00:30:25,386 --> 00:30:25,646
Scott: Check it

568
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:25,906
Scott: out.".

569
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:30,910
Scott: So, you know, usually they save people all the time, you know, usually for medical reasons, right?

570
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:38,695
Scott: Like, someone will have like, I think the biggest thing they do actually is when some people have heroin overdoses and they go and they jab them with the whatever it's called, right?

571
00:30:38,995 --> 00:30:41,117
Scott: That's like the thing they do the most more than fighting fires.

572
00:30:41,617 --> 00:30:44,079
Scott: But there was a fire, a pretty big fire.

573
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:46,320
Scott: This apartment building was way on fire.

574
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,083
Scott: Six alarm fire, which means six different fire departments came there, right?

575
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:50,823
Scott: That's what that means.

576
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:51,884
Rym: That is what that means.

577
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:52,805
Scott: People don't know that.

578
00:30:52,845 --> 00:30:53,285
Scott: They're just like,

579
00:30:53,345 --> 00:30:53,625
Scott: "What?".

580
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,347
Scott: You know, they only know about that when they're talking about like chili.

581
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:58,108
Scott: Like, it's a five alarm chili.

582
00:30:58,128 --> 00:30:58,729
Scott: What does that mean?

583
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:00,890
Scott: It means you need to call five fire departments to put out the fire.

584
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,452
Rym: That means you need to find five toilets.

585
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:04,112
Rym: Right.

586
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:06,414
Scott: Five ladders, five hoses, you know.

587
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:11,877
Scott: But anyway, so there's a six alarm crazy apartment fire and someone was trapped.

588
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:17,241
Scott: And this person was in a situation where they pretty much had two choices, which was A, burn.

589
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:18,642
Scott: Not a good choice.

590
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:21,204
Scott: B, jump out the window.

591
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:22,945
Scott: Not a good choice.

592
00:31:22,985 --> 00:31:26,447
Scott: And he was pretty high up, so not a good choice.

593
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:30,790
Scott: And normally you think, "Oh, well, the firemen would rescue them with like, you know, put the lights

594
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:30,850
Scott: on.".

595
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:35,353
Scott: Ladders up to the window, you know, walk up there, take them out of the window, walk down, right?

596
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:38,715
Scott: Or jump and land in a parachute thing like in Dumbo, whatever.

597
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:45,660
Scott: But you're imagining, you know, like when you see firemen in movies or TV shows or, you know, whatever.

598
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,644
Scott: And, you know, the window that's burning is like facing the street in New York City.

599
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:52,445
Scott: That's not how it is.

600
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:59,610
Scott: You could get a lot of situations like you're trapped between a fire and a window and out the window is like an alley.

601
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:02,515
Scott: And there's no way the fire truck's getting anywhere near that.

602
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:07,783
Scott: So what they do, and it's sort of obvious and it's exactly what it sounds like.

603
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:09,286
Scott: It's the roof rope rescue.

604
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:11,630
Scott: They practice this apparently all the goddamn time.

605
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,040
Rym: The triple R.

606
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:20,180
Scott: Yeah, they practice this apparently all the goddamn time because obviously you're going to need it in New York City, which is where they use the ladder to go on the roof.

607
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:21,682
Scott: They use a rope.

608
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:23,785
Scott: They repel down the side of the building.

609
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:27,770
Scott: You grab onto the fireman or a fire, you know, fighter.

610
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:30,974
Scott: And then they repel to the bottom of the building with you.

611
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,577
Scott: And then you run the fuck away.

612
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:34,379
Scott: And that's what they do.

613
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,781
Scott: It's exactly what it sounds like.

614
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:37,303
Scott: But they do it.

615
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:39,847
Scott: And because they practice so much, it totally worked.

616
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:42,050
Scott: And they saved this person and did not shoot them.

617
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:42,590
Scott: Yeah.

618
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:43,512
Rym: There's a lottery.

619
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:56,130
Rym: The FDNY is notable too, because it and the Detroit fire department are basically the only two fire departments that engage in a lot of rescue techniques that are actually really dangerous to the firemen themselves.

620
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:56,756
Scott: Yeah.

621
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:58,029
Scott: This is not, you know, even though.

622
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,450
Rym: Most other fire departments in the entire United States don't do a lot of the things that the FDNY.

623
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:10,184
Scott: I can't emphasize enough like how much they practice this, which is why they were able to execute it without also getting burned horribly themselves.

624
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:13,490
Scott: If you're in somewhere like a suburb with a volunteer fire department.

625
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,589
Rym: What they're going to do.

626
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,415
Scott: You need to be roof rope rescued.

627
00:33:16,796 --> 00:33:20,586
Scott: You are probably in deep shit because those volunteers have not practiced it.

628
00:33:20,627 --> 00:33:21,790
Scott: Like it's not their only job.

629
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:26,505
Rym: But if you live in suburbia, you probably live in a little McMansion or a two story house.

630
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:27,930
Rym: You can just jump out the window.

631
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,291
Scott: Yeah.

632
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:30,990
Scott: It's unlikely that you would be in a situation where you, you know.

633
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:38,307
Rym: But outside of a very small number of municipalities in the US, firemen will primarily just try to prevent the house next door from catching fire.

634
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:39,510
Rym: If there's a big fire.

635
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,027
Scott: Yep.

636
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,162
Rym: In the meta moment, the book club book is still Rebecca.

637
00:33:44,885 --> 00:33:45,969
Rym: I'm going to read it real soon.

638
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:47,930
Scott: Yeah, I will.

639
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:48,932
Rym: I mean, I'll just blow through it.

640
00:33:48,953 --> 00:33:55,930
Rym: I'm almost done with that World War Two book I'm reading, which goddamn was Yamamoto kind of a shithead.

641
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:58,029
Rym: But for reasons you wouldn't expect.

642
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,158
Rym: But we are going to be the next convention.

643
00:34:01,218 --> 00:34:03,828
Rym: red is actually Saturday and Sunday, November 12th and 13th.

644
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:04,925
Scott: That's way soon.

645
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:05,572
Rym: Yeah.

646
00:34:05,592 --> 00:34:07,250
Rym: Gamer X as a game.

647
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:09,750
Scott: How come we didn't know about this more in advance?

648
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,270
Rym: Well, I knew about it about a month ago when I reached out to them saying, hey, you want some.

649
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:17,668
Scott: That's pretty late for getting to a convention, but we're there.

650
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:17,989
Rym: So.

651
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:19,149
Rym: So we're going to be there.

652
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,498
Scott: It's right around the corner playing games two days.

653
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,070
Rym: But on Sunday, November 13th at three thirty p.m.

654
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,510
Scott: So the end of the convention, basically.

655
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:25,931
Rym: Yep.

656
00:34:25,952 --> 00:34:28,029
Rym: We are going to be doing us in at the end.

657
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:31,270
Rym: We're going to be doing an updated version of our talk on writing game rules.

658
00:34:31,574 --> 00:34:31,928
Scott: All right.

659
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:35,022
Rym: Otherwise, if you live in New York City, you should totally go to.

660
00:34:35,062 --> 00:34:36,368
Rym: this is two days of gaming.

661
00:34:36,853 --> 00:34:37,428
Scott: Why wouldn't you?

662
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:40,310
Rym: It's like a legit gaming con with legit panels.

663
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,500
Scott: I should tell the net runner people.

664
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,429
Scott: We get some net runner going on.

665
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:42,731
Rym: Yeah.

666
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:47,870
Rym: And also looking through the list of speakers who are going to be at this thing, there's some highly hidden people here.

667
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,590
Rym: Like, I'm actually kind of surprised and happy that they're letting us do a talk.

668
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:52,230
Scott: Yeah.

669
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:53,052
Rym: Yeah.

670
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:55,969
Rym: So if nothing else, it's just a legit gaming con.

671
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:58,550
Rym: We're also going to be at Magfest.

672
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,809
Rym: It's too soon to do the roar.

673
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:01,777
Rym: It's coming.

674
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:02,363
Rym: I'm saving it.

675
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:02,989
Rym: Save my laser.

676
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:05,149
Rym: Between me and Scott.

677
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,780
Scott: Can you hear it over there?

678
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:06,330
Scott: It's like two months away.

679
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,279
Rym: You can hear it in the distance.

680
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:08,470
Rym: By God, is that Magfest?

681
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:09,350
Scott: It's coming.

682
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:13,710
Rym: Between Scott and I, we're going to be on like seven goddamn panels.

683
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:15,881
Rym: I'm looking at the schedule.

684
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:16,890
Rym: There's some good stuff coming.

685
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,469
Rym: Can't talk about it yet because they haven't published the schedule yet.

686
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:25,070
Rym: But we're going to be doing two or three of our standard lectures, and the rest is going to be me on panels.

687
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:30,290
Rym: Like, actual panels, as in people talking about a topic where there's more than just me and Scott.

688
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,030
Rym: And I don't know the questions in advance.

689
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,890
Rym: Scott doesn't want to be on any of those panels.

690
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,010
Rym: He'll just be doing the lectures.

691
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,330
Scott: Why would I do a panel when I could play Dig Day?

692
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:43,930
Scott: Maybe I'll have a thing where, if you beat Scott at Dig Day, you get a prize.

693
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:48,930
Rym: Oh, we could do a standing... We should definitely do some sort of GeekNights meetup or whatever at Magfest.

694
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,830
Rym: Like, pick a time to all hang out and do a dumb tournament on some arcade machine.

695
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,270
Scott: I could make a in-person tournament, like a four-game sort of thing.

696
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,148
Scott: Like, you know, the top ex-finishers of game one, you know.

697
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,190
Scott: Like a little mini, you know, Pro Megathon.

698
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:12,869
Rym: We've got to find a listener who is good at one of these games to be the mini-boss so they can play people for like three days and then present the four finalists to us.

699
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,790
Scott: Well, high score games are the best because people can just post their high scores.

700
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:16,303
Rym: Oh, yeah.

701
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,829
Rym: So basically, every time you beat the high score...

702
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,849
Scott: And then we get to a final showdown.

703
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,985
Rym: ...tweet it at Scott being like, "Hey, I beat your Dig Dug score, and then we've got to go over there and beat it

704
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:24,227
Rym: again.".

705
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:24,888
Rym: Yep.

706
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:25,947
Rym: That could work.

707
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:26,916
Rym: Stay tuned.

708
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:27,767
Rym: We'll sort that out.

709
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,950
Rym: Otherwise, GeekNights is on Patreon.

710
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,050
Rym: There's stuff in there.

711
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:40,350
Rym: I'm reading to you, like an audiobook, the entirety of Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, the worlds of power novelization of that game.

712
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,129
Rym: It is weirdly erotic is how I'm going to describe this book.

713
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,710
Rym: Otherwise, Scott is busting out on his YouTube channel.

714
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,270
Rym: I'm continuing to put stuff up on my YouTube channel.

715
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,362
Scott: I realize something, though.

716
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:52,970
Scott: I have a problem.

717
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:53,260
Scott: Yeah?

718
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,089
Scott: Is that, you know, I don't need your little knob.

719
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:56,627
Scott: Lack of knob...

720
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,649
Rym: The knob would speed you up more than you think.

721
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,410
Scott: I am not slowing down because the knob, you know, I'm slowing down.

722
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:01,910
Scott: Rendering?

723
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:03,928
Scott: No, I just really hate editing things.

724
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:07,650
Scott: I really like taking photos and taking videos.

725
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,390
Scott: I really do not like, it's like, it's not fun to use Premiere.

726
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:10,800
Scott: Yeah.

727
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:12,210
Scott: It's like work.

728
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:12,630
Scott: It sucks.

729
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,283
Scott: I don't want to do it.

730
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:14,849
Rym: I don't like videoing things.

731
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,469
Rym: I'm good at editing things.

732
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,850
Scott: If somebody else wants to edit videos for me, I can send you so much video footage.

733
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:23,950
Scott: You could turn into awesome YouTube videos and you would get mad.

734
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:25,329
Scott: I'll give you money.

735
00:37:26,392 --> 00:37:28,150
Scott: I'm not going to be that guy who gives you exposure.

736
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,150
Scott: Right.

737
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:34,029
Scott: And then I can reduce my Creative Cloud subscription to just the Photoshop Lightroom one and stop paying for Premiere.

738
00:37:34,692 --> 00:37:36,689
Rym: I would do it, but I don't think you want to pay my rates.

739
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:44,690
Scott: Well, you also do a really shitty job with like, really lame looking fonts that look like some, you know, three-year-old.

740
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,030
Rym: Oh, I would subcontract out infographics and motion graphics.

741
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:48,850
Rym: That's a separate thing.

742
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,469
Scott: Like your title card is just like...

743
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,430
Rym: You're talking about just audio editing, video editing, that kind of stuff?

744
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:54,942
Rym: I charge $2.30 an hour.

745
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:56,090
Scott: Sure.

746
00:37:58,551 --> 00:38:02,730
Rym: So I was in Australia for a couple of weeks and everything was fine.

747
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:04,489
Rym: And Scott messaged me.

748
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:16,830
Scott: Well, because of the time zones, I'd pretty much like, you know, if something, you know, above the bar happened in the United States, I would message him assuming he was sleeping and figured I would wake up the next day with a response.

749
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,529
Rym: And you'd scoop everybody.

750
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,770
Rym: And this happened multiple times because actually newsworthy things kept happening.

751
00:38:21,476 --> 00:38:22,228
Rym: And one of those things...

752
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,230
Scott: Well, you were gone for two weeks.

753
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,870
Scott: I assume at least a few newsworthy things would happen.

754
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:26,186
Rym: Yeah.

755
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,589
Rym: The only thing I was sad about is I didn't get to watch the debate live because it was.

756
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:36,060
Rym: It ended up being at noon on a weekday and I was literally at a meeting for work during it.

757
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:36,707
Scott: Okay.

758
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:43,410
Rym: But I watched all these things go down over Twitter except this one because no one in the US could tweet.

759
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:52,510
Rym: So I couldn't see, like all I could see was the tweet stream of people like coming back online from this massive internet outage, which was actually just a DNS outage.

760
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:56,310
Rym: And no one knows how to get around basic DNS problems apparently.

761
00:38:56,611 --> 00:38:57,010
Scott: Well, okay.

762
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,768
Scott: So let me tell you.

763
00:38:57,911 --> 00:38:59,050
Scott: So I woke up in the morning.

764
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,430
Scott: I tried to go to our forum and it doesn't work.

765
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,910
Scott: It says, like, can't find server.

766
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,666
Scott: And I'm like, what?

767
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,110
Scott: I'm like, is vanilla having a problem?

768
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,089
Scott: So I tried to go to some other sites and some of them work and some of them don't.

769
00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:11,330
Scott: And I'm like, that's weird.

770
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,728
Scott: So, you know, there are other sites that aren't working, but there are some sites that are working.

771
00:39:15,872 --> 00:39:16,490
Scott: What's the difference?

772
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,208
Scott: So I'm like, all right.

773
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:19,590
Scott: Step one, dig our forum.

774
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:23,790
Scott: And it's a. I'm using Google's, you know, DNS servers.

775
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:24,689
Scott: Eight, eight, eight, eight.

776
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,310
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

777
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:28,390
Scott: And it says, nope, can't find no IP for that.

778
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,570
Scott: And I'm like, oh, that doesn't sound right.

779
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,309
Scott: But wait a minute.

780
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:31,910
Scott: I was able.

781
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:32,554
Scott: It wasn't like.

782
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,530
Scott: I couldn't contact the DNS server.

783
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,889
Scott: The DNS server said, I don't know what IP that is.

784
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:38,530
Scott: And I'm like, why don't you know?

785
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,590
Scott: So I check with the registrar and everything is kosher.

786
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:43,530
Scott: So I didn't fuck anything up.

787
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,189
Scott: No one stole our domain or anything.

788
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,328
Rym: Those things can happen.

789
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:46,887
Rym: Right.

790
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,049
Rym: Like even to smart people.

791
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,890
Scott: Even though I secured it way good.

792
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:50,428
Scott: Right.

793
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:53,510
Scott: So then I'm like, all right, what else is going on?

794
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,990
Scott: So I dig some other domains that are working and I get IPs back.

795
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,410
Scott: And I'm like, OK, so the Google DNS server is actually working just fine.

796
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:05,583
Scott: It must be something upstream is not in.

797
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,470
Scott: the hierarchy is messed up.

798
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,310
Scott: And I knew it was a DNS problem.

799
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:17,170
Scott: So I start go to Twitter because whenever there's a problem that's like super fast, you're not going to find news on Google News for like another hour.

800
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,009
Scott: You got to go to Twitter.

801
00:40:18,471 --> 00:40:19,310
Rym: But Twitter's got nothing.

802
00:40:19,631 --> 00:40:21,109
Scott: It was one of the things that were down.

803
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,090
Scott: So I don't know where to search now.

804
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,630
Rym: You know what sucks?

805
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:30,250
Rym: In the old days, like if we were still at RIT, we'd all get into an IRC or something or like Napster chat.

806
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,928
Scott: Right.

807
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:31,532
Scott: So I start.

808
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:34,609
Scott: I basically go around to news sites until I find something that's up.

809
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:35,910
Scott: Reddit was having trouble.

810
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:42,230
Scott: I found some some news source and it was like, yeah, big time DDoS attack against DYN DNS.

811
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,242
Rym: DYN DNS provides DNS to a lot of people.

812
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:48,830
Rym: because remember, DNS is just this framework.

813
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:55,409
Rym: The only like the only official DNS servers are the 13 root servers that say, yo, internet that way.

814
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,809
Scott: So it's like, yeah, it's like, sure.

815
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:01,230
Scott: All DNS does is let us use names for servers instead of IP addresses.

816
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:05,550
Scott: If I remember the IP address to the forum, I could have just typed it in and gone there.

817
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:05,677
Scott: Right.

818
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,930
Scott: But who fucking remembers the IP address?

819
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:09,790
Rym: Well, you know what?

820
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,249
Rym: You know what?

821
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:15,951
Scott: The Internet would totally work without DNS if everyone remembered and hard coded IP addresses like.

822
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:19,169
Scott: you have to remember that Google is one, two, three, four, whatever it is.

823
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:19,450
Scott: Right.

824
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,470
Scott: It's not one, two, three, four.

825
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,589
Scott: It's like the whole point of names.

826
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:25,729
Rym: And the old days was that humans, you know, you would remember names, which is funny.

827
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:31,546
Rym: because now like we got to don't anymore like DNS is not used the way it was used in the early days.

828
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:31,950
Rym: Yeah.

829
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:37,990
Rym: Like DNS names now are just soft links pointers to where the real thing is.

830
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:42,610
Rym: So the real thing can move and they're the tie to your SSL certificate.

831
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:45,690
Rym: Like those are the only things that it's really used for in the modern era.

832
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,690
Rym: So like these extra top level, we've talked about DNS.

833
00:41:48,930 --> 00:42:00,230
Rym: I don't want to get too into that, but, uh, the funny thing is if we were still living in beacon when this would happen, when this happened, we would have been fine because back then we ran our own DNS server with caching.

834
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:04,428
Scott: Someone wrote this great article that was like, Hey everybody, this should teach you a lesson.

835
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,690
Scott: I know that none of you were going to read this and learn this lesson or change what you're doing.

836
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:14,690
Scott: You're going to still do things the wrong way, but everyone is setting their DNS TTL is way too short.

837
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,027
Scott: You got to Jack them up.

838
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,510
Rym: Yeah.

839
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,329
Rym: But why do you set it so short?

840
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,350
Rym: You don't change that often.

841
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:27,590
Scott: People set their TTLs short so that when it is time to change, they can change it and have the change happen really quickly.

842
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:43,030
Scott: Whereas if you set your DNS TTL to something reasonable, like a day, eight hours, something like that, then if you need to change to different server infrastructure and move your DNS, you have to wait eight fucking hours to do this changeover thing.

843
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,150
Scott: It's just like, it sucks at that one moment.

844
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:59,090
Scott: So just to make your life more convenient, that one rare time you actually have to do something, you basically throw away the, you know, you're basically telling every DNS server on earth, Hey, don't remember my IP address for very long, right?

845
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,550
Scott: You know, just throw it out after a few minutes and then look it up again.

846
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:10,110
Scott: And what this does is a, if shit goes down, all these DNS servers around the earth, forget your IP address and have to ask for it again.

847
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:11,588
Scott: And if you're down, you're down.

848
00:43:12,772 --> 00:43:15,530
Scott: And to, uh, it creates a lot of bandwidth.

849
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:25,250
Scott: There's all these extra DNS requests now going farther up the hierarchy of the DNS infrastructure that could make their way all the way up to root and back down.

850
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,510
Rym: Yeah.

851
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:37,330
Scott: They could have just hit like a server, you know, for example, you know, if I ask what, you know, I'm asking Google's DNS, but let's say you, most of you are using your IP ISPs, DNS, like you're asking time Warner or charter or whoever.

852
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,651
Scott: Right.

853
00:43:38,134 --> 00:43:41,090
Scott: So, or Verizon on my iPhone, like you're using Verizon, right?

854
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:43,210
Scott: So it would just ask Verizon and get an answer.

855
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:50,950
Scott: But if my TTL is five minutes, five minutes later, Verizon is going to have to ask my DNS provider for the IP again.

856
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:58,409
Scott: Whereas if I would have just told Verizon, Hey, remember that shit for like a day, it would only ask my server once a day for every Verizon user.

857
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:03,412
Rym: Now around this is what I would do in the past when I used to administer to this sort of thing.

858
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:04,570
Rym: is I would set up granted.

859
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:14,150
Rym: This is an older time, like shit's moved fast, but I would have pretty long TTLs, but I would set it shorts in advance of coming changes.

860
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:14,531
Scott: Right.

861
00:44:14,591 --> 00:44:20,330
Scott: But if you know you're doing some sort of release and you're really clever and well-organized, you can set it short a day in advance.

862
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,652
Rym: Yeah.

863
00:44:20,914 --> 00:44:21,136
Scott: Right.

864
00:44:21,196 --> 00:44:23,130
Scott: Or well, far enough in advance, like two weeks in advance.

865
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,828
Scott: Then after, you know, it's good set, you know, and you're stable with the new environment, set it long again.

866
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:29,470
Rym: Now here's the trouble.

867
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:38,950
Rym: Some people set it short for failover disaster recovery ways so that they can quickly redirect in a failover, which you literally cannot schedule.

868
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:46,930
Rym: But if you care about uptime that much, you should have dynamic IPs to begin with.

869
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,870
Rym: Like there are not dynamic IPs in the classic sense.

870
00:44:49,290 --> 00:45:00,750
Rym: You should have, there are special IPs you can get that you can sort of reroute on the fly, even on the Internet or like within your organization, you can get layer three switches that perform like switches.

871
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:09,050
Scott: But Amazon, Amazon Web Services has elastic IPs where if one of your servers, you can buy basically an IP address and point it at a server.

872
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:10,908
Scott: And now that server has that IP.

873
00:45:11,472 --> 00:45:14,830
Scott: And if that server completely sets on fire, you need to make a new server.

874
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:16,770
Scott: You can move that IP to the new server.

875
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:16,971
Scott: So

876
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:33,911
Rym: one thing I'm going to do, because I'm going to have a spare computer soon when I fairly soon start upgrading all my biz is I'm probably gonna start running a local DNS server again with caching, because that actually is a big performance boost, especially if you're accessing sites where DNS queries are slow and it would have protected you from.

877
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:46,088
Scott: But if you if you override the TTLs that they send you with, you know, your own longer TTL, you could end up in situations where if something happens to them, you think they're down and you go to is up dot me and they go, oh, no, they're up.

878
00:45:46,573 --> 00:45:46,776
Scott: Yeah.

879
00:45:46,837 --> 00:45:47,590
Scott: And you're like, oh, shit.

880
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:48,748
Scott: And you got to flush your DNS cache.

881
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,171
Rym: Yeah.

882
00:45:49,312 --> 00:45:51,929
Rym: But I could put I could run a squid proxy, too, and just go double.

883
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,790
Scott: That's you know, then you're getting websites that aren't even update.

884
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:58,190
Scott: You're getting like an old version of the news because it hasn't been updated yet.

885
00:45:58,450 --> 00:45:59,659
Rym: Because I want to do it just because I haven't.

886
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,674
Rym: I haven't run that kind of structure in a long time.

887
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:03,270
Rym: So I want to see what the current state of it is.

888
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,970
Rym: If there's anything clever I can do, it's I couldn't do in the past.

889
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:12,970
Scott: You know, the best thing you can do with it is you can offload ad blocking off of your own computer to the computer and you can do ad blocking.

890
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:18,749
Scott: That's even better than, you know, for example, like if you know there's a certain ad server, you can just block all traffic to it.

891
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:24,134
Scott: And now it doesn't matter what browser you're using or like if you're using a phone or any any.

892
00:46:24,235 --> 00:46:29,929
Scott: every single device on your network will not have that ad server completely blocked because you blocked it at this sort of proxy level.

893
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:35,450
Rym: So what actually happened here, as best we can tell, is it was a simple.

894
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,509
Scott: Still don't know who did it or why.

895
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:37,991
Rym: Right.

896
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:48,110
Rym: I read some evidence that it's probably some script kiddies who took advantage of things that may have been placed by state sponsored actors because the mirror, the Mirai malware.

897
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:48,535
Rym: Right.

898
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,870
Scott: So I heard about the tools.

899
00:46:49,971 --> 00:46:50,132
Scott: Right.

900
00:46:50,152 --> 00:46:51,500
Scott: So we don't know the user of the.

901
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,452
Rym: that's the one that the source code got leaked recently.

902
00:46:53,492 --> 00:46:53,613
Scott: Right.

903
00:46:53,633 --> 00:47:02,413
Scott: We don't know the user of the tools or the motivation for using them to attack DineDNS specifically, but we do know that the tool was like made open source recently.

904
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:09,430
Scott: And usually what happens is somebody will you know, people who are like the real black cats of the world will make evil tools.

905
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:09,791
Scott: Right.

906
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:18,430
Scott: But since they made those evil tools, if they use them now, they can sort of be found by like the intelligence community is like, ah, this is the tool that was used.

907
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:20,629
Scott: It must have been Rym made that tool.

908
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:26,230
Scott: So what you do is while you're still anonymous, you sort of make your tool open source.

909
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:29,489
Scott: So plausibly anyone could have used it.

910
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:33,950
Scott: And now when you use it, you know, they don't know who it was.

911
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:35,909
Scott: It could have been anyone because it's some open source tool.

912
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:43,150
Scott: Now, the malware itself is nothing special, except that I imagine if like you make it you had a gun and you're going to shoot somebody.

913
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:47,221
Scott: But if you do that, they're like, aha, this was the gun used in the murder and it's got fingerprints on it.

914
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:47,869
Scott: Like, shoot.

915
00:47:48,391 --> 00:47:52,090
Scott: So you make a billion infinity identical guns and hand them out to everybody.

916
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:54,410
Scott: And now it could have been any one of us.

917
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:55,749
Scott: Everyone has that gun.

918
00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:09,630
Rym: So in the old days, malware like this, when you activated a botnet because the machines that had this were bought, they're part of a botnet effectively, they would themselves initiate the DDoS, however it was run.

919
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:11,669
Rym: That is old style.

920
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:23,470
Rym: This botnet is a meta command and control layer that would, when activated, itself go out and activate a giant legion of even dumber bots.

921
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:31,210
Rym: And it appears that those bots were almost entirely Internet of Things nonsense, fridges and DVRs and cameras and shit.

922
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:31,611
Rym: Right.

923
00:48:31,652 --> 00:48:34,469
Scott: So people are using PCs less and less these days.

924
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,490
Rym: So this actually reduced the effectiveness of bots.

925
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:37,851
Scott: Right.

926
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:39,490
Scott: There's still lots of PCs out there.

927
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:48,992
Scott: I'm sure you can make a nice botnet out of Chinese PCs or whatever, but, you know, and people are going to things like Windows 10, they're upgrading, they're using OS X more and such.

928
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:54,749
Scott: So there are less vulnerable PCs in the wild to make a bot to, you know, infest and make a botnet.

929
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,410
Rym: I mean, how many people actually pirate Adobe software to join that botnet?

930
00:48:58,711 --> 00:48:58,853
Rym: Right.

931
00:48:58,994 --> 00:49:00,550
Rym: It's a large number, but it's not that many.

932
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,789
Scott: It's not as many as it used to be.

933
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:06,470
Rym: It's not as many as the traffic that goes to the sites you're trying to DDoS on a normal basis.

934
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:07,273
Scott: Right.

935
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:11,791
Scott: And not only that, but it's like if you attack PCs, there's not so many users of them.

936
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:14,706
Scott: You know, they're not even a good target, even though you do like.

937
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:18,210
Scott: the thing that's nice about attacking PCs is that they're really powerful.

938
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:18,832
Scott: Yeah.

939
00:49:19,033 --> 00:49:19,295
Scott: Right.

940
00:49:19,315 --> 00:49:22,110
Scott: You know, if you get one PC, that's as good as getting like six phones.

941
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:33,110
Scott: But anyway, so people have phones and tablets now and those are actually also if they're running, you know, modern Android, iOS, you know, they're kind of hard to infect.

942
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:36,090
Rym: You got to go out of your way to get infections on these devices.

943
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:41,033
Scott: It's like, yeah, you can, you know, you know, the security patches for them usually come out pretty quick.

944
00:49:41,595 --> 00:49:46,749
Scott: And while there are various vulnerabilities, there's always those like pwn to own events.

945
00:49:47,511 --> 00:49:50,130
Scott: Usually you have to like have access to the device to own it.

946
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:50,371
Scott: Right.

947
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:52,485
Scott: It's like something that you can get through the lock screen.

948
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:59,049
Rym: or if they visit a shady website and do a thing or the speakers are running and then they get that sound gap thing I talked about earlier.

949
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,440
Scott: Yeah, but it's like it's really it's.

950
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,175
Scott: you know, it's not easy to make a botnet out of iPads.

951
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:04,681
Scott: Right.

952
00:50:04,762 --> 00:50:05,550
Scott: It's pretty tricky.

953
00:50:05,691 --> 00:50:08,450
Scott: So what do you make a botnet out of these days?

954
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,743
Scott: And that is devices that are Internet connected.

955
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:13,590
Scott: that aren't people don't realize.

956
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:19,949
Rym: So think about your like shit ass router that you get with your Internet service provider like five or six years ago.

957
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,510
Scott: They never updated the firmware on it ever.

958
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:25,110
Rym: It came with the default username and my password.

959
00:50:25,711 --> 00:50:28,685
Scott: Even my fancy router hasn't had a firmware update in.

960
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:29,589
Scott: I don't even know when.

961
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,452
Rym: Yeah.

962
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:39,829
Rym: Now think about if you go on Amazon and buy some random TiVo knockoff and just plug it into your home Internet and it just works.

963
00:50:40,892 --> 00:50:43,670
Rym: Well, you don't know what the fuck's running on that or what it's doing.

964
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:45,850
Rym: How would you even know if it was compromised?

965
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,769
Rym: At least your computer might run slow.

966
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:48,151
Rym: Yeah.

967
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:53,526
Scott: And let's say you go to the store and you buy like, you know, some home Internet security device.

968
00:50:53,607 --> 00:50:53,809
Scott: Right.

969
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:58,130
Scott: So these kinds of devices that people make, they're using it.

970
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,110
Scott: You know, how do you make something like this?

971
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:03,870
Scott: There's certain features you want, like maybe a garage door opener for your house.

972
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:04,212
Scott: Right.

973
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:06,970
Rym: So say you want to control that garage door opener from your phone.

974
00:51:07,011 --> 00:51:08,210
Rym: That's a cool thing to sell to someone.

975
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,311
Rym: Either the phone has to connect directly to it, which is not going to work, which it does.

976
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:15,310
Scott: It could work, but it's just too difficult to make that work.

977
00:51:15,832 --> 00:51:18,270
Rym: So even if they did make it work, it would be just as insecure.

978
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,669
Rym: What you're to run jetty in there, have some Apache running on.

979
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,950
Rym: But like there'd be a server that no one updates.

980
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,390
Scott: You'd have to have like a whole computer in your garage door opener.

981
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,300
Rym: That's fancy that no one's going to be.

982
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:34,330
Scott: the person in their car has to know how to connect to it with Wi-Fi or with Bluetooth or something complicated.

983
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,110
Scott: And there's like a whole process they have to go through.

984
00:51:36,412 --> 00:51:37,256
Scott: And that's not going to work.

985
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:40,701
Scott: You need a situation where the person pushes a button and the door opens.

986
00:51:40,984 --> 00:51:41,570
Scott: And it's simple.

987
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:51,070
Scott: And the only way to do that architecturally is to say, OK, the garage door opener connects to the Internet with Wi-Fi, their phone connects to our server.

988
00:51:51,432 --> 00:51:53,130
Scott: They visit a Web page on our server.

989
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:56,685
Scott: They log in, they press a button, and then we connect to the.

990
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:57,589
Scott: we know who it is.

991
00:51:57,851 --> 00:51:59,070
Scott: So we know it's garage door opener.

992
00:51:59,190 --> 00:51:59,331
Scott: It is.

993
00:51:59,552 --> 00:52:02,308
Scott: So we connect to the garage door opener of the Internet and open it.

994
00:52:02,892 --> 00:52:05,130
Rym: Now, there's nothing wrong with this in theory.

995
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:11,896
Rym: I mean, you could make that possibly secure, just some SSL and basic security principles.

996
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,450
Scott: There's a way to make it secure.

997
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:19,936
Rym: But usually it's all clear text like like security is not even the last concern when they make these devices.

998
00:52:20,177 --> 00:52:22,090
Rym: It is not thought about at all.

999
00:52:22,231 --> 00:52:22,433
Rym: Right.

1000
00:52:22,594 --> 00:52:24,470
Rym: Think about a college project.

1001
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,189
Rym: We have to write an app to do something like this.

1002
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,590
Rym: You send a clear text, not even a password.

1003
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:34,710
Rym: You just send a command and you get the act back and then you submit the code and get your B. That is what's running on these devices.

1004
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:43,530
Scott: So now you have an evil bot and the evil bot just goes around the Internet looking at IP addresses, trying to figure out what device is at that IP address, what what's it running, what's it doing?

1005
00:52:43,631 --> 00:52:44,556
Scott: So it goes around the Internet.

1006
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:47,273
Scott: It's just hitting stuff, you know, pinging and ponging and whatever.

1007
00:52:47,293 --> 00:52:49,930
Scott: And it says, oh, here's an IP address and there's a device here.

1008
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,290
Scott: What kind of device is this?

1009
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:52,569
Scott: Let me scan all the ports.

1010
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:55,468
Rym: Oh, it's a Sonmai Technologies DVR.

1011
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,930
Rym: Well, I know the hard coded username and password for that.

1012
00:53:00,331 --> 00:53:01,749
Scott: Let me try to log into this DVR.

1013
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,348
Scott: Oh, look, I've logged into this DVR.

1014
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:04,609
Scott: I'm not even a real person.

1015
00:53:04,711 --> 00:53:06,390
Scott: I'm just searching the Internet for things.

1016
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:09,730
Scott: And this is one of the things that I'm pre-programmed to know about.

1017
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,450
Scott: I have now connected to it.

1018
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,709
Scott: I have full access to it.

1019
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:20,229
Scott: I will install this software on it and it will continue to do its DVR thing until such a time as I tell it to attack DynDNS.

1020
00:53:20,972 --> 00:53:26,470
Rym: I saw multiple people I know who are smart when the DDS happened afterward.

1021
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:36,130
Rym: They did things like start doing a packet capture of their Internet traffic egress and seeing, wow, 60 megabits a second coming out of my DVR.

1022
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:36,831
Scott: Right.

1023
00:53:36,851 --> 00:53:37,273
Scott: Yeah.

1024
00:53:37,353 --> 00:53:40,750
Scott: All those smart TVs that people buy because they have like Netflix built in.

1025
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:41,513
Scott: They don't to buy.

1026
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:47,410
Rym: My TV has a network and ethernet port on the side of it is never getting plugged in, never getting plugged into anything ever.

1027
00:53:47,531 --> 00:53:47,714
Scott: Right.

1028
00:53:47,734 --> 00:53:48,770
Scott: So it's like, yeah.

1029
00:53:49,132 --> 00:53:53,734
Scott: If that phone doesn't keep getting that TV, doesn't get updated with security updates and such.

1030
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:56,250
Scott: And, you know, it's like they wrote software for it once they shipped it.

1031
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:56,979
Scott: They were done with it.

1032
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:57,670
Scott: They don't give a shit.

1033
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:01,681
Rym: Meanwhile, the only TVs that update are the ones that are updating to show you ads in the menus.

1034
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:02,069
Scott: Yeah.

1035
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:04,058
Scott: I'm only getting hits.

1036
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,510
Scott: I get monitors, not TVs.

1037
00:54:06,354 --> 00:54:06,820
Scott: But anyway.

1038
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:07,610
Scott: Yeah.

1039
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,269
Scott: Someone just take over your TV and you're watching TV.

1040
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,450
Scott: But meanwhile, the TV itself is attacking, sending spam or something.

1041
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,446
Scott: You don't even know.

1042
00:54:15,466 --> 00:54:15,589
Rym: Yeah.

1043
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:21,792
Rym: And I don't know when this I mean, this is the technology exists for this all to work fine.

1044
00:54:22,113 --> 00:54:31,411
Rym: It's just the consumers of these devices, at least a consumer of a PC or a tablet or something else, has some level of understanding as to what that device is capable of.

1045
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:36,858
Rym: But when they buy like a garage door opener, they do not make the leap to this is a computer.

1046
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:37,470
Scott: Yeah.

1047
00:54:37,751 --> 00:54:39,610
Rym: So they don't even know there could be a problem.

1048
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:45,711
Scott: They're selling fridges at the Home Depot and those fridges have Android running on them.

1049
00:54:46,477 --> 00:54:48,190
Scott: And no one really pays attention.

1050
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:57,550
Scott: And, you know, people get upset if their Android phone doesn't get updated to the newest candy, whatever it is, kick cats or, you know, jujubes or whatever the fuck.

1051
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,670
Scott: But you don't care of a shit about updating the Android on your fridge.

1052
00:55:02,351 --> 00:55:05,970
Rym: So back it up to the actual response as a human to the DDoS.

1053
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,969
Scott: And now your fridge is spying on someone's email.

1054
00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:18,450
Rym: Even if you had your caching DNS, a lot of the services you might have tried to access were failing anyway because internally they relied on DNS as well.

1055
00:55:19,312 --> 00:55:23,870
Rym: And a lot of time that internal DNS has the exact same problems, the extra like a lot of Linux servers.

1056
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:35,530
Rym: If you set up a Linux server and you just kind of slapdash about it and you don't put like at least a reference to localhost or your own IP address or something in your host file, usually that's there by default.

1057
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:38,403
Rym: Yeah, but it's easy to fuck that up.

1058
00:55:38,424 --> 00:55:39,710
Scott: or how could you fuck that?

1059
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:45,034
Rym: I have witnessed more than once overly clever admins saying, why would I have an entry for this in my home?

1060
00:55:45,054 --> 00:55:49,059
Scott: And removing pretty sure in Ubuntu, actually, if you don't, it does it by default.

1061
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,130
Scott: It does it by default.

1062
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:57,389
Scott: And if you don't have the hostname entry in the host file, when you do certain things like sudo, it'll be like, hey, yep, why don't you have this?

1063
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:12,184
Rym: A lot of Linux like certain software, like in the boot sequence even, it'll just wait forever and eventually time out on stuff because it tries to initialize something that needs localhost or needs IP access before the DNS stuff activates and actually starts looking stuff up.

1064
00:56:14,692 --> 00:56:36,370
Rym: But the only solution to that is like the best practice is if you run a real network, even though you want stuff to be dynamic, if you have like a critical front end web server that accesses a critical back end database server, you should have fucking host name, host files pointing directly at those internal IPs on the servers and you just have scripts that change those in the event of a failover.

1065
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,959
Rym: You also use the also.

1066
00:56:39,019 --> 00:56:42,529
Scott: that gets you a lot of performance improvement because you're saving all this DNS traffic.

1067
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:43,032
Rym: That does.

1068
00:56:43,293 --> 00:56:47,486
Rym: I'll tell you what I used to do with this complex system involving some middleware, some TibRV.

1069
00:56:48,311 --> 00:57:00,070
Rym: And we found that just by putting with no other changes, just by putting standard host files that had all the core systems internal to our network in those host files, we got like a 10 percent performance improvement.

1070
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:04,527
Scott: If there's a website that you visit like crazy often, like say Google.com, it's like.

1071
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:10,610
Scott: it's like if you do a dig for Google.com, you're going to get a ton of IPs back and it changes pretty frequently based on where you are.

1072
00:57:10,852 --> 00:57:13,410
Rym: There's load balancing and all this kind of stuff that goes on.

1073
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:21,570
Scott: But odds are, if you pick just a Google IP that like you got when you're at your house, that IP is going to keep working for quite a long time.

1074
00:57:21,991 --> 00:57:27,490
Scott: If you just put it in your host file, you're going to have a much faster Google.com for until it stops working.

1075
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:32,300
Rym: In fact, way back, remember when there was a lot of trouble in New York years ago with YouTube like not working?

1076
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:33,070
Scott: I don't do that though.

1077
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:33,674
Scott: I'm too lazy.

1078
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:34,137
Scott: Yeah.

1079
00:57:34,178 --> 00:57:35,850
Rym: But remember, YouTube like wouldn't work that well.

1080
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,050
Rym: Like you get the first 10 seconds of a video and then you couldn't watch the rest of it.

1081
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:40,150
Scott: That was a short period of time.

1082
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:40,333
Scott: Yeah.

1083
00:57:40,354 --> 00:57:40,947
Scott: It was messed up.

1084
00:57:40,967 --> 00:57:41,110
Scott: Yeah.

1085
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:53,589
Rym: While that existed, if you were clever, you could use host files to force your usage of YouTube from like beyond the caching servers to the back end to only use the nodes that were probably working.

1086
00:57:54,113 --> 00:57:55,990
Rym: And that made the YouTube situation better.

1087
00:57:56,472 --> 00:58:00,030
Rym: And then it broke everything later because, you know, that stuff changes.

1088
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:06,330
Rym: But, you know, I mean, it's, you know, those files are something that you should use because they're a powerful weapon.

1089
00:58:06,673 --> 00:58:08,469
Rym: But also remember that you use them.

1090
00:58:08,812 --> 00:58:11,130
Scott: The DNS failover is a good strategy, right?

1091
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:21,370
Scott: It's like, you know, you have your DNS, you know, look and you could even do geo stuff these days where it's like, aha, this user who's asking for the IP address of front recruit dot com, they are in New York.

1092
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,650
Scott: So I will tell them this answer.

1093
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:24,468
Scott: Oh, this person is in Bulgaria.

1094
00:58:25,112 --> 00:58:30,157
Scott: I will tell them a different answer because I have a different Web server in that part of the world and it will be faster for them.

1095
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:33,415
Rym: or like put your SSL up on Cloudflare and use that.

1096
00:58:33,759 --> 00:58:34,550
Scott: The Cloudflare does.

1097
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:35,669
Scott: That's one of the things Cloudflare can do.

1098
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:36,092
Rym: Yeah.

1099
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:37,330
Rym: Cloudflare is actually pretty good.

1100
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,510
Scott: Amazon Route 53 can also do this.

1101
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,136
Scott: Yeah.

1102
00:58:40,156 --> 00:58:41,209
Scott: So many things that can do this.

1103
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:41,593
Scott: Right.

1104
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:43,530
Scott: It's like it's like a standard feature these days.

1105
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:48,490
Scott: But, you know, or it's like, oh, the DNS server will say, aha, this server is down.

1106
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,410
Scott: I will tell them the IP address of a server that is up instead.

1107
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:58,569
Scott: But if your TTL is really long, that kind of feature doesn't work because the person, you know, the server goes down, they try to visit it.

1108
00:58:59,031 --> 00:59:02,790
Scott: They get the cached IP address, which is the IP of the server that's down.

1109
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:04,900
Scott: And they see that you're down and they never.

1110
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,794
Scott: they never ask you for the new IP address till the TTL is over.

1111
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:20,411
Scott: And if your TTL is like eight hours, you're going to be down for if you don't bring that server back up at the same IP, you're going to be down for eight hours for that person, even if you're up for other people who aren't caching the DNS as long.

1112
00:59:20,752 --> 00:59:22,480
Rym: So what are the takeaways from this?

1113
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:35,313
Rym: to kind of wrap up the show, put a nice little bow on it, be done because I'm kind of hungry other than the fact that the Internet of Things is is the Internet of shit right now and you really just should not use any of those devices.

1114
00:59:35,574 --> 00:59:47,490
Scott: or unless you are an expert or if your only choice is to get a device that has these features disabled and do not use them and do not connect your device with Wi-Fi or Ethernet to the Internet, use it without connecting it.

1115
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,010
Scott: And if that's not possible, find a different device that will work.

1116
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:50,533
Scott: I think you can't.

1117
00:59:50,714 --> 00:59:53,529
Rym: I think the consumer side of it just can't be dealt with.

1118
00:59:54,151 --> 00:59:55,094
Rym: So I feel like.

1119
00:59:55,656 --> 01:00:01,194
Rym: I feel like the government actually should have the capacity to force those nodes offline.

1120
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:06,872
Rym: Like if your house is issuing a video as fuck you, that's a good thing.

1121
01:00:07,072 --> 01:00:18,868
Scott: Also, I think the government should be able to force companies that make devices to either a issue software updates or be forced them to release their code to the public so that somebody can fix them.

1122
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:23,133
Scott: If you're not going to update the software and your Internet connected like that, you know, they regulate.

1123
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:29,470
Scott: the FCC is like, hey, you can't interfere or, you know, must accept all interference, the same kind of regulation.

1124
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:29,992
Scott: Right.

1125
01:00:30,012 --> 01:00:32,090
Scott: You must update to be secure.

1126
01:00:32,392 --> 01:00:35,550
Scott: If a vulnerability is found that is affecting the whole Internet, you're interfering.

1127
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:37,590
Scott: Your device is illegally interfering.

1128
01:00:37,751 --> 01:00:37,951
Scott: Right.

1129
01:00:38,473 --> 01:00:42,970
Scott: Or B, you must at least open source it so that somebody else can, you know.

1130
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:43,913
Rym: But I'm OK.

1131
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:47,570
Rym: I'm totally OK with counter strikes disabling these devices remotely.

1132
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:51,640
Rym: And if consumers complain, well, they can take it up with the company they bought the garbage from.

1133
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:52,149
Rym: Yeah.

1134
01:00:52,552 --> 01:00:54,090
Scott: And if that company doesn't exist anymore.

1135
01:00:55,112 --> 01:00:55,293
Rym: Yeah.

1136
01:00:55,494 --> 01:00:57,384
Rym: And in terms of the impact of the Internet, it's so.

1137
01:00:57,586 --> 01:00:58,370
Scott: it's so cyberpunk.

1138
01:00:58,591 --> 01:00:58,853
Scott: Yeah.

1139
01:00:59,276 --> 01:00:59,577
Scott: Oh, man.

1140
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:01,530
Scott: The garage door openers, they're hacking.

1141
01:01:02,332 --> 01:01:03,583
Rym: I used to have garage door openers.

1142
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:04,430
Rym: I was in middle school.

1143
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:06,041
Scott: My restaurant is down.

1144
01:01:06,324 --> 01:01:06,889
Scott: I can't pay.

1145
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,033
Scott: I lost all my money.

1146
01:01:08,174 --> 01:01:14,910
Rym: I went around because garage door openers usually like when I was a kid, there'd be like two or three or maybe if you were fancy.

1147
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,128
Scott: Oh, the thermostat stole my money from a bank account.

1148
01:01:18,312 --> 01:01:20,590
Rym: I will realize that I really happens.

1149
01:01:20,831 --> 01:01:26,377
Rym: I will raise the temperature of your apartment by one degree Fahrenheit every hour until you give me a Bitcoin.

1150
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,030
Scott: Listen, that's a real world thing.

1151
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:29,581
Rym: That there's a proof of concept.

1152
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:30,650
Rym: Someone wrote that malware.

1153
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:31,313
Rym: It exists.

1154
01:01:31,413 --> 01:01:31,654
Rym: Yeah.

1155
01:01:31,675 --> 01:01:36,050
Scott: This isn't something that, you know, it is something out of a novel, but also for reals.

1156
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,102
Scott: Absolutely.

1157
01:01:37,365 --> 01:01:37,690
Scott: For real.

1158
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:38,337
Scott: For reals.

1159
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:39,169
Scott: Earth.

1160
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:43,830
Scott: Not some fantasy world of Snow Crash, but also some fantasy world.

1161
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:46,530
Rym: But luckily, the impact to the U.S.

1162
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,069
Rym: Internet was negligible.

1163
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,468
Rym: Everything was back up pretty quick.

1164
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:55,209
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, when something that big goes down, the top men are on the top men top.

1165
01:01:55,812 --> 01:02:00,576
Rym: I have been on the other side of those sort of situations in the past, like when I used to work at IBM.

1166
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:01,508
Scott: You're not top.

1167
01:02:02,112 --> 01:02:02,655
Rym: No, but I was.

1168
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:05,390
Scott: I was like you're at best mid.

1169
01:02:05,892 --> 01:02:09,469
Rym: I have been in like response teams to stuff like this.

1170
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:21,266
Rym: And usually the answer is you just kind of sit there and monitor it and either sort of manually start to figure out ways to identify the bad traffic and block it.

1171
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:25,170
Rym: or you say, fuck it, pull the cord and wait for real top men to deal with it.

1172
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:31,150
Scott: I always that's always my solution to everything is like, hey, I'm paying people at like the real places like Amazon or whatever.

1173
01:02:31,412 --> 01:02:32,887
Scott: They'll fix it and they'll let me know.

1174
01:02:33,412 --> 01:02:33,614
Rym: Yup.

1175
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:35,109
Scott: I don't have to do shit.

1176
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:36,683
Scott: I got nothing to do with it.

1177
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:44,980
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1178
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:50,100
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1179
01:02:50,481 --> 01:02:55,520
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion, news and more.

1180
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:03,200
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1181

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1182
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:11,000
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1183
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:14,140
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1184
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:38,520
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights in order the amount of money they give you to make bases are Ellen Joyce, Rebecca Dunn, Nicholas Brando, Heidi McNichol, Amanda Duchette, Christian Koons, Construction Noises, Ivy Faye, MyStacy.com, William Eisneros, Jeremy Miner, Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

1185
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,139
Rym: Chris Hahn and Thomas Reimer.

1186
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,106
Rym: You fucker.

1187
01:03:45,801 --> 01:04:08,620
Rym: Sharon Van Hor, Leaky Kid, Rare Lavell, James David White, Rochelle Montanona, Superboy, Irish Wristwatch, Aaron Cerise, Brian Fisher, Sailor Vister, Jai Friedpork, Matthew Smith, Don Schleich, Jarth Tovjian, Joshua Joestar, Teller, Ella Shenjager, Sam Cordry, Clinton Walton, Run From New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Booz, Scared Yalander, Brian Sidroni, Finn Eric Silveroff, The Rural Juror, Chris Minkoff, Chris Knox, Daniel Redman, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

1188
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,600
Rym: I can't believe it's the 11th anniversary of GeekNights.

1189
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,300
Rym: We've been doing this for a fucking long time.

1190
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,871
Rym: We have like 1100 episodes up.

1191
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,017
Rym: We've done 40 panels at PAX's.

1192
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:28,400
Rym: And so what I leave you with is I'm actually going to read for you right now the slightly unnerving story of Fishy from Fark.

1193
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:39,160
Rym: The story was originally posted on Fark by the user Quexy, Q W E X Y. Psychosis or ghost story?

1194
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,382
Rym: I don't know.

1195
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:46,138
Rym: When I was little, probably about four or five years old, I had an imaginary friend, I think.

1196
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:55,670
Rym: It was yellow and about four feet tall, taller than me at the time, bipedal and had oversized eyes that always looked straight ahead.

1197
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:58,680
Rym: otherwise, relatively human and naked.

1198
01:04:59,624 --> 01:05:01,118
Rym: I called the thing fishy.

1199
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:06,399
Rym: The weirdest thing, though, it was that it scared the hell out of me.

1200
01:05:07,265 --> 01:05:08,559
Rym: I didn't want anything to do with it.

1201
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:11,760
Rym: And I couldn't imagine as a child that it was coming from inside my head.

1202
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:20,439
Rym: It walked or more like skated along on the walls in the rooms of our house and apparently could not leave those surfaces.

1203
01:05:21,582 --> 01:05:24,660
Rym: I knew that if I played outside, it could only follow me to the limits of the garage.

1204
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,160
Rym: It always followed me, too, even though I often told it not to.

1205
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:36,740
Rym: I had difficulty concentrating on drawing things or reading because fishy was always standing somewhere on the wall, looking over my shoulder.

1206
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:38,899
Rym: It did not ever sit down.

1207
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,760
Rym: It didn't ever have facial expressions and it never made any noise.

1208
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:49,380
Rym: The only times I ever interacted with fishy when I was sick in the middle of the night or when I woke up panicked from nightmares.

1209
01:05:49,862 --> 01:06:00,240
Rym: Those times, if I looked at it intently, fishy would methodically start drifting along the wall toward my parents bedroom, around the corner, out the door, down the hall.

1210
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:05,257
Rym: As soon as it was out of sight, I start calling for my mom, as in, "Mom, I'm going to

1211
01:06:05,317 --> 01:06:05,819
Rym: barf.".

1212
01:06:06,181 --> 01:06:09,019
Rym: And she drove quickly, "God bless you, Mom," to help me through it.

1213
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,620
Rym: Fishy would come back, though, as soon as I'd recovered.

1214
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:19,879
Rym: Then it would stare at me for the rest of the night, two days or longer, staring then in the direction of my parents room.

1215
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:25,360
Rym: It finally vanished when my sister was born in 1992.

1216
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,606
Rym: I was almost eight years old by then and I'd been ignoring fishy for about a year, but not so much that I didn't notice.

1217
01:06:30,646 --> 01:06:34,643
Rym: he learned to fly off the wall and visit the floor from time to time.

1218
01:06:35,365 --> 01:06:44,360
Rym: There was one instance in the last two months of fishiness when I saw it at someone else's house, a new home that friends of mine, two sisters were moving into.

1219
01:06:45,181 --> 01:06:48,618
Rym: Their father walked into the room and we were there playing with the moving boxes.

1220
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:50,399
Rym: he'd given us one another, blah, blah, blah.

1221
01:06:50,920 --> 01:07:01,240
Rym: And in the darkened laundry room behind me, or behind him, filling the entire doorway at many times its normal size was fishy, staring down at the father's back.

1222
01:07:02,261 --> 01:07:04,500
Rym: It wasn't scary so much as irritating.

1223
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,100
Rym: We moved away from there less than a year later.
