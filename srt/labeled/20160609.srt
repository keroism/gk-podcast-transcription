00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,791
Rym: It's Thursday June 9th 2016.

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:15,780
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:18,238
Rym: Twitter plays GeekNights.

4
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:20,532
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:27,880
Rym: So Over the weekend, you know, sometimes the toilet just starts running a little bit.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,700
Rym: You know like juggle a handle like it makes noise that thing that a lot of people's houses we visit just do constantly.

7
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:39,540
Rym: So I replace the bit that causes that problem and I read the rubbery ring on the inside.

8
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:42,599
Rym: Yeah, a little rubber thing that the flap that comes up the flapper.

9
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:47,580
Scott: Yeah I need to replace my flap too because mine also has a tiny tiny leak and yeah constantly makes noise.

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,080
Rym: It started doing it over the weekend and I was like well, nope, and I just I went to Amazon.

11
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:55,014
Rym: I immediately ordered it and the funny thing was I was likes your own.

12
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,584
Scott: you didn't get the super to fix it Why would I?

13
00:00:57,644 --> 00:01:00,953
Rym: but the super would take like a week and then they'd come in and track some like.

14
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:01,775
Rym: it's a pain in the ass.

15
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:10,138
Scott: Put the old home back out like a showerhead, but I paid like a dollar for it.

16
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:12,065
Rym: It took 30 seconds.

17
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:12,851
Scott: How did you get one?

18
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:13,900
Scott: That's the right one for your toilet?

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,570
Rym: So well the how I did it this time is I sat down.

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,718
Rym: I said fuck what kind did I get?

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,402
Scott: so I searched and did you like empty the tank by like turning the water off and then flushing and So.

22
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:28,393
Rym: so I guess I've done a lot of handyman stuff a lot.

23
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:32,831
Rym: He's tell us so basically I Go to wear gloves and reach your hand in the tub.

24
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:33,615
Rym: why even wear gloves?

25
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:34,258
Rym: it's clean in there.

26
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:35,986
Scott: Mine mine actually has.

27
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:43,600
Rym: I have a problem a separate problem and that not only do I have to wait wait What problem could cause that water to be unclean poop coming back up?

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,321
Scott: No, why?

29
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:46,367
Scott: nobody did an upper decker in there?

30
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:48,514
Scott: that I know of but there's some sort of like.

31
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:52,210
Rym: there's some sort of silty residue Up there and I told it as the same thing.

32
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:52,754
Scott: I don't know.

33
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:53,840
Scott: I don't know how to clean it out.

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,808
Rym: That's a New York thing.

35
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:56,200
Scott: Oh, is it a New York thing?

36
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:03,960
Rym: There's silt in a lot of our water Especially because it'll happen anytime they lie, but it's only in my toilet not in any of my water sources.

37
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:07,953
Scott: Yeah, cuz it's pretty diffuse and I don't know and it keeps dirtying up my bowl.

38
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:10,000
Scott: Yeah, so how do I clean it out of there?

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,833
Rym: Uh empty it and just clean it out with like paper towel and a scrubber.

40
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:14,576
Scott: That sucks.

41
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,498
Rym: Yeah, or just leave it There doesn't hurt anything.

42
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:18,627
Scott: It makes my toilet bowl.

43
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,880
Scott: I had to clean my toilet bowl more often because it keeps getting brown.

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,194
Rym: Oh, it doesn't get into the toilet bowl.

45
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:22,739
Scott: mine does.

46
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:28,920
Rym: Usually when that happens it's because there was recent construction and they shut off your water at some point.

47
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:36,148
Rym: You don't know if they did because the New York they pretty much always do it because it'll happen in a neighborhood and if you Don't have a doorman like they won't even tell you.

48
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:43,080
Rym: between like noon and 3 on a Wednesday The water will just be off and then it'll be on again and most people have no idea this happened.

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,164
Scott: I guess that could have happened.

50
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:45,809
Rym: It's actually pretty common.

51
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,800
Rym: The only reason I know when it happens here having to work a lot.

52
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,660
Rym: Yeah, it happens all over in New York.

53
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:58,820
Rym: But because we have a doorman Whenever it happens the doorman puts a sign in the elevator that says yo water's not gonna work for this one hour period on Thursday.

54
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:01,025
Rym: So I just know every time that happens.

55
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:03,071
Rym: It happens like once every couple months.

56
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:07,324
Scott: I mean maybe like a Little less than a year ago.

57
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:11,260
Scott: the water main way down the street broke, but that was like six or seven blocks away.

58
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:12,589
Scott: I don't think it was affecting me.

59
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,340
Scott: My water worked fine during that period.

60
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,891
Rym: But anyway, so I go to.

61
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:20,453
Rym: I sit down at Amazon and I'm like, oh wait What the shit for tying up?

62
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:21,770
Rym: There's a Kohler toilet I think.

63
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:30,531
Rym: so I just type flapper valve and the first result that shows up help replace mine too is one that says you Purchased this on this date.

64
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:31,556
Rym: When did you know?

65
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:32,299
Rym: when did you buy one?

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,913
Rym: I bought one about three years ago because Emily's toilet has started running.

67
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:37,440
Rym: So I just clicked rebuy.

68
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,230
Rym: It came the next day.

69
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,094
Rym: I spent 30 seconds.

70
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:44,800
Scott: So there's a recent song called rebuy that just came out.

71
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,699
Rym: But yeah, basically all you got to do is just look up like the name of your toilet and There's probably doesn't have like a model number written on it.

72
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:54,748
Rym: I didn't even.

73
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,327
Rym: I just looked up the name The maker of the toilet.

74
00:03:57,347 --> 00:04:00,245
Scott: cuz my toilet is made by I guess I have to look at the flap and then look You know what?

75
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:02,823
Rym: You'll have a Bemis Kohler like.

76
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,995
Rym: I don't even know any other names of toilet brands.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,240
Scott: I Got a white the most plain gennaro white porcelain potty you ever seen and it's New York modern building.

78
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:13,966
Rym: I will bet you a dollar.

79
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,815
Rym: It's a Kohler koh le are or something like that.

80
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,732
Rym: I'll take a look at it but yeah, so I replaced the thing.

81
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:31,780
Rym: and Then I was thinking because I know a lot of people some of these people I still know Where they will say things to me like oh, you've got a jiggle the toilet to make sure it stops.

82
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,790
Scott: That means it's broken.

83
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,723
Rym: fix it And they've been.

84
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:38,939
Scott: mine is mine doesn't have the jiggle problem, but so mine started up.

85
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,030
Scott: the jiggle Just makes noise, but there's.

86
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,214
Scott: no there's no point in jiggling.

87
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:44,579
Scott: It just constantly makes noise.

88
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,852
Rym: So when I will usually the jiggling will like reseat the flap a little bit and then it'll like stop it temporarily But once you flush it's gone again.

89
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:51,740
Scott: No, I mean mine.

90
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,613
Scott: Well, if you no matter what if you jiggle it'll just keep making noise.

91
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,120
Scott: cuz like there's this tiny leak in the thing.

92
00:04:56,642 --> 00:05:00,500
Rym: Oh mine would just like get kind of like weak so it would fall into the hole a little bit.

93
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,538
Rym: But if you jiggle it right it would get a better seal that it wouldn't run.

94
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,831
Rym: But the the flapper was a little loose too.

95
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:07,835
Rym: So I fixed that.

96
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,160
Rym: that took I don't know eight seconds.

97
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,539
Rym: I don't know.

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,400
Rym: There are a lot of people out there who seem to like when something minor happens to them in a house, especially houses.

99
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,280
Rym: It's not even apartments because at least some lazy people will call the super in an apartment.

100
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:28,014
Rym: But like people who own houses will not fix Obviously annoying things for ever like they'll just never fix them.

101
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:30,020
Rym: It's just like well, there's a hole in this wall.

102
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,309
Rym: I guess this is my life now.

103
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:32,780
Rym: This hole is just here.

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,390
Scott: I mean if something is not broken to the point where it actually like, you know, like people have a computer that's all slow But it's like they're still getting their work done.

105
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,879
Scott: They'll just suffer through the slowness.

106
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:43,283
Rym: Yeah But why.

107
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:52,280
Rym: but it like suffering through your toilet making an annoying noise basically all the time wasting water Constantly when you can spend a dollar and 30 seconds to fix it.

108
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:54,185
Rym: Like you just not know.

109
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:54,767
Scott: they just don't.

110
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,880
Rym: you just think toilets work that way cuz your parents never replaced your flapper.

111
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:05,805
Rym: I don't even think It's kind of like how a lot of people we know have really nice houses and yet they have the default like shit-ass Showerhead up there.

112
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:06,267
Rym: Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:07,955
Rym: Like guys 20 bucks.

114
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,525
Rym: You get a real showerhead Like I don't understand.

115
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:14,338
Rym: people don't upgrade their software or the people because today I noticed this.

116
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:19,015
Rym: I was biking and I'm not complaining about fixies, but this other class of people.

117
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:23,259
Rym: they have bikes with gears Usually don't use them, but well, I'm not even talking about that.

118
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:35,968
Rym: But I'll see him biking because I pass them and their bikes are squeaking So loud squeaking and clanking and rattling like you've probably never Sprayed anything on those gears.

119
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,640
Rym: that chain is probably dry as my best bones in the desert.

120
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:47,850
Rym: Surprise, the changes doesn't snap and you fall over like the bike is screaming to you to end its misery Like if you never maintained a bike before.

121
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,137
Rym: at least the stupid fixie people, you know They make a big deal about.

122
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:56,840
Rym: oh I got my simple bike and I care a lot about simplicity for some stupid reason even though it's objectively inferior.

123
00:06:57,364 --> 00:07:07,040
Rym: But these are the people who have a more complex bike Obviously maintain it less than the simple bike and the bike still goes and they complain about it being like it's low maintenance.

124
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:22,014
Rym: Yeah Like you can take a bike with gears Literally never maintain it and while it'll squeak and squeal and scream at you constantly and rattle and be slow It seems like 80% of New Yorkers ride bikes like that everywhere.

125
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,118
Rym: So still works.

126
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:26,413
Scott: Toilet still removes the poop so they don't.

127
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,504
Scott: you know, that's it Why don't?

128
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:29,748
Rym: here's a YouTube video.

129
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:38,718
Rym: go around the city buy like one thing of lube and Go around the city to bikes that are chained up on the street and just lubricate them all just like lubricated.

130
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:39,524
Rym: make a video about it.

131
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:42,447
Rym: Mm-hmm Go for it public service.

132
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:43,572
Rym: Like you're a superhero.

133
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:44,134
Rym: I'm gonna lube.

134
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:44,857
Scott: you have extra lube.

135
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:45,440
Scott: You can go do that.

136
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:46,840
Rym: I actually do have extra lube.

137
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,405
Rym: I got a I accidentally bought.

138
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:59,036
Rym: I thought I was buying one, you know Actually buying a four-pack one of those things that last me like a decade.

139
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:01,657
Rym: so Anyone need some bike lube?

140
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,386
Rym: So you got any news?

141
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:07,690
Scott: I Couldn't really find any normal GeekNights news.

142
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:10,220
Scott: So I guess we'll just go with the serious news, right?

143
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:19,554
Scott: So I'm sure anyone who is a person who knows information knows that Muhammad Ali One of the greatest people to ever live has passed away and that is not usually.

144
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:22,720
Scott: we don't usually talk about celebrities dying On GeekNights, right?

145
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,767
Scott: Usually because most of the time we don't care.

146
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:27,620
Scott: That's just people mean there's millions of people dying all the time.

147
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,826
Scott: Yeah, and why?

148
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:34,658
Scott: just cuz you're a celebrity doesn't make you any more important than anyone else But mom and Ali is more important than everyone else.

149
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,559
Rym: Muhammad Ali, I mean one if you don't know like we're not right.

150
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:41,168
Scott: It's not even the fact that he died.

151
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:44,360
Scott: that is notable because to be honest it was like he was dead.

152
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:51,440
Scott: He said Parkinson's disease and been like basically not able to do much for quite a significant period of time.

153
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,726
Scott: So it's like he's been dead, right?

154
00:08:54,187 --> 00:09:05,180
Scott: What's notable I think is, you know, the fact that he has died obviously brings out You know everybody who you know never knew who he was and you can see the typical internet reactions.

155
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:09,300
Scott: But mostly, you know the the yeah, we expected it.

156
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,200
Scott: But when you act, you know, there's the reaction that you expected.

157
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:19,054
Scott: But once you actually see it you still shake your head Which is the punk kids who didn't know who he was because they're too young.

158
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:20,680
Rym: So yeah, like I'm gonna link to it.

159
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:23,240
Rym: It's kind of my thing of the day, but I'll just talk about it now.

160
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:28,177
Rym: So there's a famous famous monologue that Billy Crystal and already half you were thinking.

161
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:28,960
Rym: Who's Billy Crystal?

162
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:43,179
Rym: Did and basically he recounted Muhammad Ali's life up to that point as a Monologue and it was funny but serious because Muhammad Ali's life so amazing that people haven't seen this.

163
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,395
Rym: yeah, like this is this was a staple like I just like everyone saw this.

164
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:51,468
Rym: everyone knew about this and Apparently Billy Crystal is gonna do.

165
00:09:51,528 --> 00:10:01,897
Scott: or did the eulogy for Muhammad Ali's funeral like he was Considering the Howard Cosell who also people listen to this don't know who that is Yeah is died in like 1990 something but most of Twitter was left.

166
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:05,573
Rym: They were like who the hell is this Billy Crystal and why?

167
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:07,080
Rym: what the hell does he have to do with Muhammad?

168
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,948
Rym: I leave and who's this Cassius Clay guy?

169
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:10,349
Rym: Like?

170
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:11,271
Rym: was it his brother?

171
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:17,340
Rym: Like I found some shit poking around on the internet The thing that I saw the moat the thing.

172
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,080
Scott: Well, I shake my head at the people who don't know who he was, right?

173
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:25,675
Scott: And I think I think the 90s is like the cutoff right because like I was born in the 80s Which is still after the end of his career.

174
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,000
Scott: pretty much Yeah, right.

175
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:39,428
Scott: But I still knew everything there was to know about him and saw all his fights before YouTube and then saw his fights again When YouTube came out, he was the last great hero of boxing And he was also just kind of a hero as a person.

176
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:47,740
Scott: there weren't I mean there aren't really if you think about you know True like actual heroic human beings that were real people and weren't fictional.

177
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:54,133
Scott: There really aren't many right who alive Could you say is like at the superhero level.

178
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:55,419
Rym: if Muhammad Ali?

179
00:10:57,021 --> 00:11:04,020
Rym: Person can you even think of the guys level the guy that they made Hotel Rwanda about the NATO guy who saved all those people?

180
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:06,280
Rym: Sure, he was great UN guy UN UN, right?

181
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:06,863
Scott: But he's not.

182
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:09,120
Scott: he's not even like half Muhammad Ali love.

183
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:23,813
Rym: There's the thing if you took if Muhammad Ali had not existed and you wrote a movie script about a guy like Muhammad Ali with that level of Just humor and presence and record and everything It seems like a fictional person like people would say that dialogues unrealistic.

184
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:26,483
Rym: No human is that clever in Conversations?

185
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:27,487
Rym: no humans that funny.

186
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:30,740
Rym: No humans that real and no one could be that good of a boxer.

187
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:32,483
Scott: It's like.

188
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:32,764
Scott: so.

189
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:36,620
Scott: here's the things that people still don't understand right if you're a punk kid, right?

190
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:49,100
Scott: First of all, people don't understand that between the year up until like the 80s and 90s Right actually up until the 90s pretty much Boxing was the number one sport, right?

191
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,807
Scott: Football was not the real football is.

192
00:11:51,928 --> 00:12:12,493
Scott: in the United States football is number one and in the whole world soccer was always one Right, but before the 90s before like the end of Mike Tyson's career Right like Tyson Holyfield era from that going backwards all the way back to like, you know Joe Louis times right in the ancient days like 40s 50s, right?

193
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:15,119
Scott: Whatever, you know max Fleming, whatever, right?

194
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,813
Scott: Boxing was the number one sport in the entire world.

195
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:23,419
Scott: It was the most important thing There was in sports right horse racing was like number two.

196
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:29,820
Scott: Yeah, you know baseball was bigger than you know, but it's like football ice hockey basketball.

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:41,895
Scott: Those are all like sideshows right the way that all these other sports aren't, you know, and if you were the heavyweight champion of the world You were like the most dangerous man on earth, right?

198
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:45,800
Scott: You were like the most famous but it's like You know.

199
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Scott: You look today like some of like the biggest like standalone individual sport athletes like like Novak Djokovic He's like the champion of tennis right now or like Tiger Woods, right?

200
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:01,200
Scott: Muhammad Ali was like 10 times as famous and big compared to Tiger Woods.

201
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:02,400
Rym: It's very important.

202
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,217
Rym: Is that he had a voice?

203
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:04,318
Rym: that?

204
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,652
Rym: Would have otherwise been ignored had he not had that fame that the position he held.

205
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:17,374
Rym: his skill at boxing made him so powerful in Society that the shitty white people couldn't ignore him.

206
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:18,798
Scott: No, you couldn't ignore him.

207
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:19,360
Scott: He's the most.

208
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:20,508
Scott: That's like you.

209
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:21,294
Rym: look at this Wikipedia.

210
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:22,180
Rym: Look at this record.

211
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:31,340
Rym: It's just like this crazy sea of winds The years where he wasn't allowed to box because he refused to fight Vietnam because he refused to go kill brown people overseas.

212
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:34,872
Rym: Well, you know when they never called him nigger they never did anything to him.

213
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:37,020
Scott: He didn't say that he said something like that.

214
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,287
Rym: He said I don't.

215
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:39,615
Scott: you said I ain't got no quarrel.

216
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:40,400
Scott: No Viet Cong.

217
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:45,420
Rym: There was another longer quote that he gave in an interview that I pulled up a little while ago.

218
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,140
Scott: I'll find it cuz I really good right but that's another thing right is so, you know, he was right a Muslim, right?

219
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,708
Scott: And we are here at GeekNights.

220
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:54,940
Scott: Very anti Skyman, right?

221
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,039
Scott: Yeah So you think why are you so in love with Muhammad Ali who is as pretty much as pro Skyman as you can be?

222
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,488
Scott: Well, the fact is is that even though he was pro Skyman He was Malcolm X Skyman style, right?

223
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:11,440
Scott: And the fact is that type of Islam that he believes in right?

224
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,123
Scott: Yeah, okay.

225
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,672
Scott: He believes in a ridiculous Skyman that doesn't exist which is not good, right?

226
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:26,259
Scott: But that imaginary Skyman's Imaginary teachings happen to be the same thing that my complete lack of Skyman also teaches me, right?

227
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,127
Scott: It's like he was you know, he wasn't uh, you know, like a terrorist Muslim right like killing everybody.

228
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,900
Scott: He's like, yeah, he refused to go to the war and kill Vietnamese people.

229
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:44,839
Scott: I would have done the same exact thing yeah for a different reason and they suspended him from boxing in basically his prime years.

230
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:56,068
Rym: and When he finally won his court case because again, he was so famous and powerful that he couldn't be ignored He finally won he started boxing again And he was still an unbeatable powerhouse.

231
00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:01,382
Rym: Nate silver wrote an article a little while ago on 538 that said that his greatness defied Statistics.

232
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:05,294
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically you had this like invincible human being right?

233
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:06,116
Scott: There was a comic book.

234
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:08,062
Scott: That's famous like Muhammad Ali vs Superman.

235
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:12,480
Scott: it's like yet and that made sense because he was the closest thing to Superman that ever existed.

236
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:18,960
Scott: Right, this isn't like, you know, like even Wayne Gretzky isn't even half as great right Wayne Gretzky?

237
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,279
Scott: His name is the great one.

238
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:26,960
Scott: Not even you could combine like Wayne Gretzky Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan and you still wouldn't have one Muhammad Ali, right?

239
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,932
Scott: He's like a historical figure like Alexander the Great, right?

240
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:42,767
Scott: This is this is like, you know, the supreme Amazing human being right people don't understand because they weren't alive when he was still a person that you would see You know walking around and talking whatever.

241
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,473
Scott: so I guess is that big.

242
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:49,546
Rym: I guess what I should say to you guys that he was a hero to multiple generations of people.

243
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:59,960
Rym: like we grew up at the end of the era where kids looked up to this guy and like really Understood and remembered him and here we were probably like the last generation to understand who he was and his message.

244
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:06,920
Rym: You know everything that he stood for as a person for the most part is not only relevant today, but it's sort of starkly relevant.

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,180
Rym: Like really wish Parkinson's hadn't taken him out cuz we could kind of use him.

246
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,073
Scott: I mean, you know, he got punched in the head a lot.

247
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:22,180
Scott: Yeah, but he punched Right, I mean basically and the thing is right, you know is the other major thing, right?

248
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,800
Scott: So when he started his career, he was gonna fight Sonny listed right after winning the gold medal the Olympics, right?

249
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,059
Scott: And nobody gave him a chance.

250
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:31,736
Scott: Of course Nobody gave him a fucking chance.

251
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:36,095
Scott: As little as people know about Hamad Ali people don't know anything about Sonny listed.

252
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:49,780
Scott: at the time Sonny listed was the scariest Mother fucker to ever walk the earth because if you were the heavyweight champion in the world You were the scariest most dangerous most famous athlete on the face of the earth, right?

253
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,737
Scott: Like if Sonny listed you heard he was that he was gonna be in your town soon.

254
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:55,382
Scott: You would run away Right.

255
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:59,479
Scott: This is like the most dangerous human being there ever was and some punk kid who's like 20 something.

256
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,443
Scott: It's like.

257
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:03,460
Scott: it's like so incredibly confident that he's gonna beat the shit out of him.

258
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,133
Scott: Like imagine if you saw me right coming up like I'm gonna beat up Superman.

259
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:12,210
Scott: Yeah, I can take him I can take him I'm gonna take him down in eight eight rounds.

260
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:12,874
Scott: No seven.

261
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:14,762
Scott: No, I'll make it six I'll take him.

262
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:15,044
Scott: right.

263
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:22,669
Scott: you and you see me with like not looking very scary at all Right, like I'm this beautiful, you know human being.

264
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:31,139
Scott: right, you know, I'm look kind of strong, but I don't look scary Like I can take Right and I'm acting like I'm gonna do it.

265
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,340
Scott: Right, first of all, everyone's gonna hate you and think you're a moron and bet against you, right?

266
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,716
Scott: Which is why it was such a humongous deal anyway, so people just don't get it.

267
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:41,980
Scott: It's like you weren't there.

268
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:43,171
Scott: I wasn't there and I get it.

269
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:44,100
Scott: How come you weren't there?

270
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:45,200
Scott: But you also don't get it.

271
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,931
Scott: I guess if you don't you don't have to be there to understand.

272
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:52,689
Rym: if you don't know anything about Muhammad Ali Yeah, you're still curious why.

273
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,539
Rym: who this Cassius Clay guy as we talked about earlier, too.

274
00:17:56,781 --> 00:18:11,119
Rym: Watch the Billy Crystal thing because it's inspiring and the most beautiful thing about it I watched it again because I hadn't seen this since I was a kid is that it has this little insert of Muhammad Ali Watching Billy Crystal like Asian TV.

275
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:12,807
Rym: Yeah, and it's just.

276
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:13,048
Rym: it's.

277
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:15,580
Rym: it's really inspiring and it's it's a good thing to watch.

278
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:19,560
Scott: You mean you should just actually watch Muhammad Ali fight.

279
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:30,473
Rym: also, you should also read all the things he wrote and said because I mean this thing is boxing is boxing gave him The platform to be right, you know, he saw unlike other people right?

280
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:33,220
Scott: He sought out the camera at all times, right?

281
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,180
Scott: He was a person who tried on purpose to like go out there.

282
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:50,120
Scott: He wasn't someone who was like, you know, you know, like you look at say some current athletes like, you know, no comment You know like I got nothing like Marshawn Lynch would be like the example of someone just like avoids the media at all costs or like when Pete went at even athletes that don't avoid the media.

283
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,760
Scott: It's like they only talk to it as much as they have to and they always make politically correct non comments.

284
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:57,913
Scott: They don't say anything right.

285
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:03,140
Scott: and it's like man I really wish one of these athletes who just say whatever they really wanted to say all the time.

286
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,480
Rym: It's like whenever they do it's always like ridiculous racist nonsense, right?

287
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:19,799
Scott: But it's like we already had that and you really know in a way not doing it is sort of like, you know You know sort of like saying look I can't do it as well as Muhammad Ali did.

288
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:21,826
Scott: Oh, I'm not even gonna bother.

289
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,171
Rym: in his Wikipedia article.

290
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:25,540
Rym: There's an entire section about his trash talk.

291
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:28,288
Rym: Why not like a big separate section?

292
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:34,669
Rym: all le le regularly taunted and baited his opponents Before the fight and often during the bout itself.

293
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,414
Rym: He told Frazier in the match.

294
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,979
Rym: He was too dumb to be champion.

295
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:40,385
Rym: This is good stuff.

296
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:46,312
Rym: So another kind of interesting news, you know AlphaGo like Humans have no input and go anymore.

297
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,458
Rym: Ai's got it.

298
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:52,031
Rym: There's something really fascinating going on now and I'll just link to one of these.

299
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:58,148
Rym: but basically they're pointing the same AI Google's deep mind at Atari 2600 games.

300
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,253
Scott: that should be pretty good.

301
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:00,900
Scott: I mean pong should be real easy, right?

302
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,944
Rym: The rationale.

303
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:07,040
Rym: but they're not seeding it with the historical information or historical games.

304
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:13,539
Scott: Right because they wanted to do AlphaGo just like self-trained 100% instead of training it on previous games, which they did.

305
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:17,116
Scott: Yep, well, they did both but right but I'm saying did it with their goal?

306
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:17,780
Rym: history of go?

307
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:21,400
Scott: Yeah, but their goal was to be able to do it with only self practice.

308
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:24,168
Rym: So this is interesting because the AI is give it.

309
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:29,746
Rym: basically this AI is learning to play Atari games the way me and Scott Literally don't play Atari games.

310
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:30,328
Rym: We were little.

311
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,316
Rym: we sat down in front of an Atari.

312
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:40,540
Rym: We could see the screens We could hit the buttons We didn't have the instruction books and we would just sort of do stuff until we eventually figured the game out.

313
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:51,020
Scott: I mean, but are they telling it things for example, like, you know The score going up is better because usually if you have like a normal old genetic algorithm You would say like a score up better score down worse and then it would figure things out.

314
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:54,212
Scott: Are they doing that or they just so they did a bunch of different things?

315
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:56,220
Scott: or are they letting it figure out that score to?

316
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,642
Scott: Go up.

317
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:57,408
Rym: So get this.

318
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,840
Rym: This is where it gets crazy.

319
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,209
Rym: They did a bunch of different things, but they're trying something.

320
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:03,880
Rym: The goal is they're calling it intrinsic motivation.

321
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:23,859
Rym: Basically, they want the AI to get addicted to finding novelty Because the only way to find novelty in a game is to progress through the game mm-hmm and Basically, like if they don't give it that Sense that goal of try to make things happen that I've never seen

322
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:24,000
Scott: right?

323
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,660
Scott: They doesn't know how to value one thing over another right?

324
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,999
Scott: Could play pong and decide that losing is good.

325
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:34,092
Rym: It basically went back and forth between these two screens and never really progressed anywhere.

326
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:43,020
Rym: as soon as they told it with no other Thing to seek novelty then it's explored already more than half of Montezuma's revenge, which is one.

327
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:43,584
Scott: Oh, it's not.

328
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:44,792
Scott: it's not playing versus games.

329
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:46,020
Scott: It's playing a single-player game.

330
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:55,595
Rym: It has all the buttons of an Atari and it can see the screen and that's always gonna put it on lowest difficulty maybe.

331
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:00,814
Scott: So I'd like to I'd rather it play outlaw watch itself.

332
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,582
Rym: watching this is Fascinating.

333
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:12,620
Rym: It's a lot like watching an AGD Q and I look forward to the day when AGD cues will basically just no one has to manually make a tool assisted speed run.

334
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,466
Scott: You just have an alpha.

335
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:15,056
Scott: go does the speed run and there it is.

336
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:16,883
Rym: Yep I mean alpha go.

337
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:28,873
Rym: they think about all the human effort and now I'm not saying it was wasted in the sense that the people Doing it enjoyed it like the Final Fantasy 4 run where the dude fucking like memorized random Right, but imagine if we can just have a computer just like.

338
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:29,960
Scott: make the perfect run.

339
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,809
Scott: It would discover things you didn't even discover doing frame by frame.

340
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,291
Rym: Yep.

341
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,000
Rym: So this is just really fascinating stuff.

342
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,195
Rym: But again, I stress the reason I bring them up is new.

343
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:38,920
Rym: this up is news.

344
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:47,947
Rym: AI is moving so much faster than you realize and Like you saw Google's making their own chips now Just for AI.

345
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:49,940
Rym: like they're not even selling them to other people.

346
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:54,865
Rym: They're making their own chips to use themselves to do That.

347
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:56,331
Scott: I know of they are.

348
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,580
Rym: they are either acquiring or building one.

349
00:22:58,861 --> 00:22:59,564
Rym: I don't know the four did.

350
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:03,864
Scott: they just buy like one of each machine and make a tiny fab so that they could make like One chip at a time.

351
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:06,196
Rym: It's not quite how it works.

352
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:08,004
Rym: Yeah But it was so.

353
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:09,791
Rym: actually I know there's an FPGAs.

354
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:20,560
Rym: the reason I know they're not so the reason I didn't read Like I don't know all the details of that is that that's my Monday news and we skip skip to Monday shows I'm doing the next Monday, but they're making the tensor chips tensor flow stuff.

355
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,795
Rym: So basically they're chips that only do the stuff they need for neural networks and nothing else.

356
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:27,400
Scott: is making a hardware version of?

357
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,303
Rym: Yes So they can.

358
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:35,380
Scott: basically they're just taking their software and making a hardware chip that does of the software does to make it go fast.

359
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:43,120
Scott: Cuz if you cuz think of it this way a general-purpose computer has to the calculations Like if I made a counter-strike chip and I think there's a computer that just like.

360
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:44,610
Scott: It's just like.

361
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:45,279
Scott: yeah, there we go.

362
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,080
Rym: but it's a little more unique than that because this tensor flow stuff is kind of fuzzy logic or like it's not like the.

363
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,776
Rym: you Know the old days where Pentiums if you multiplied certain numbers would get the wrong answer.

364
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:55,539
Rym: and how that that was.

365
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,780
Scott: That was one Pentium chip and it was like one specific.

366
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,847
Rym: Well, it was the first run of Pentium and it was.

367
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:05,567
Rym: it was that they were not accurate beyond a certain point in Floating point calculations.

368
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:06,773
Scott: Yeah, there was some register.

369
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:07,839
Scott: So those busted I forget.

370
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:09,750
Rym: now It was a logic error from what I read.

371
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:11,380
Rym: Anyway, I could go look it up again.

372
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,655
Rym: I I looked it up to do a talk on it like ten years ago.

373
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:15,217
Rym: Okay.

374
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:18,054
Rym: Yeah Anyway, I digress it never mattered.

375
00:24:18,316 --> 00:24:20,066
Rym: keep an eye It mattered to a few people.

376
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:29,744
Rym: you keep an eye out for this AI stuff like I bring it up on Thursday because Monday is like check out what it's doing and Tuesday would be AGD cues.

377
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:35,040
Rym: but Thursday is the shit's gonna affect your life in a real way way sooner than you realize.

378
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:41,250
Rym: Probably something that was funny today is You know that the president like the nomination process in America is over.

379
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:42,073
Rym: It's Trump and Clinton.

380
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,277
Rym: They're running like that's it.

381
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:43,618
Rym: Whatever.

382
00:24:43,979 --> 00:25:01,300
Rym: but What's interesting is that nothing the crazy candidate from all reports actually like reads his own Twitter Himself and like type shit into it Which is crazy because like any professional politician hires someone to do that for them also doesn't have time to do that.

383
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:10,180
Rym: Yeah, so and it appears that the crazy one also takes it all really personally like literally just responds to random people And it's just like that sort of thing is happening.

384
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:24,016
Rym: So the Hillary account tweeted something that was you know The delete your account like Trump's have something dumb and it was like delete your account and it went crazy viral What was interesting and I didn't even think about this until I found these compilations.

385
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:24,759
Rym: This is one of them.

386
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:29,957
Rym: Anyone older than like 35 has no fucking idea what that means.

387
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:37,260
Rym: It means It means what you said is so egregious that you should just delete your account and literally go away from this social network forever.

388
00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:39,199
Scott: Right as in you know, you have a Twitter account.

389
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,433
Scott: Delete it so that you don't see your tweets anymore and you stop tweeting.

390
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:44,240
Rym: Yeah, like you shouldn't be on this.

391
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,293
Scott: What at me I mean, it's pretty and there's no jargon there.

392
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:48,920
Scott: It's delete your account.

393
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,284
Rym: What's the main?

394
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:56,524
Scott: like regular old media like and it's like say it's like say like if someone says something stupid to you and you Say kill yourself.

395
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:14,000
Rym: Yeah, so this is a video and there are many of these Of all the sort of mainstream news outlets around the world who don't understand what this means Trying to explain it badly to the people who watch TV news meaning the people who also don't understand what it means.

396
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:20,410
Rym: It is amazing to watch the generational divide so starkly and clearly demonstrated.

397
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:30,016
Scott: Well, you know what as you know, you might be laughing at those people, but hey the people who know what delete your account means They don't know who Muhammad Ali is but the people watching the news do.

398
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:32,146
Rym: yeah Of course.

399
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:43,320
Rym: at the same time the people are watching the news Also have their hands on the money and power and at least currently because they're old and also I'm sure some of the people watching The news are those racist types who were like they know who?

400
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:48,900
Scott: Like use a slave name because they hate him they hate him or they're like, you know die Muslim whatever right?

401
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:49,988
Scott: There's that kind of people.

402
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:58,806
Rym: Yeah, fuck them Things of the day.

403
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:00,353
Rym: I already talked about the Billy Crystal thing.

404
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:01,960
Rym: Just watch it like seriously.

405
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:04,531
Scott: So he's using your news as a team.

406
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:07,004
Rym: Okay, that was my thing of the day, but it was relevant I guess.

407
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:08,598
Rym: so, I guess I got another thing here.

408
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:22,240
Rym: this is a video of a guy who is playing around with the steady cam like a for-real one and he's got a $70,000 fancy camera on the steady cam the steady cam that like you wear with like a vest and she up and he's like Holy shit.

409
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,863
Rym: this is amazing.

410
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:24,089
Rym: and he's like check out stable does this?

411
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,238
Rym: and he starts jumping around and acting the fool.

412
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:33,100
Scott: and uh So if you've never used a steady cam before you got to be first of all to use a steady cam in the first place.

413
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,104
Scott: You got to be jacked right?

414
00:27:34,124 --> 00:27:36,051
Scott: Like I couldn't wear one because it's too heavy.

415
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:37,315
Scott: I'm just like follow could wear.

416
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,239
Rym: you could wear this one.

417
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:43,340
Scott: I've seen like every time I ever see someone with the kind where there's a they look way bulky.

418
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,664
Rym: They're not that heavy.

419
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:52,235
Scott: No, no, but every time I see someone wearing one it they're always a buff, dude Like, you know, you ever see cameraman cameraman are always huge.

420
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,180
Scott: You never see like a little skinny.

421
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,315
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of them aren't buff.

422
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:56,040
Rym: They're fat.

423
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:03,289
Scott: There's still us and underneath that if you took all the fat off me and all the fat off them They would be jacked and I would not.

424
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:05,479
Scott: I still wouldn't be able to do a push-up.

425
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:09,559
Scott: If I had less to push it's because I lack in the pushing power not in me.

426
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,462
Rym: So I'll put it this way

427
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,526
Scott: not that the pushing is

428
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:24,576
Rym: steady cam type things like these camera stabilization things are amazing technology but they're the kind of technology that will fail on you in Crazy ways if you're not trained and you don't know how they actually work

429
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,400
Scott: like tempered glass.

430
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:32,335
Rym: Yeah, so this guy Let's the arm extend a little too far because it'll like.

431
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:38,060
Rym: you can jump up You can let go of it and jump up and down and it'll be perfectly steady.

432
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:50,459
Rym: But if that arm extends a little bit too far like beyond its safety Then now you've got this long thin skinny arm with a lot of like Mechanical logic in it and you've got a really heavy camera on the end of it.

433
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:53,079
Rym: It hits the safety threshold and it just collapses.

434
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:57,300
Scott: Why don't they change the hinge so it can't extend farther than it should?

435
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:02,173
Rym: Well No one who's ever used one of these things would make that stupid mistake.

436
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:04,600
Rym: is one to put it that far away from your body?

437
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:07,857
Scott: To get even close to that you have to like let go of it.

438
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,289
Rym: Yeah You already have to be.

439
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:11,819
Scott: no one has an arm that long.

440
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:13,005
Rym: Try to give an equivalent.

441
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:16,280
Rym: like to get to the point you'd have to like run away from it.

442
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:18,738
Scott: Like leave it there and run.

443
00:29:19,402 --> 00:29:20,366
Rym: Like to turn.

444
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:26,730
Rym: like imagine you're riding a bike and you just suddenly turn your front wheel 90 degrees to the left as hard as you can.

445
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,400
Rym: like yeah, the bike will let you do that.

446
00:29:30,124 --> 00:29:31,694
Rym: You know not to do that.

447
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:32,519
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

448
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:38,380
Rym: So this guy basically turned the wheel 90 degrees to the right and it is a sublime moment.

449
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:43,275
Scott: Alright, so here's a video that I saw a long time ago like in the RIT days.

450
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:44,058
Scott: It went around.

451
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:49,360
Scott: I think This was uploaded to YouTube when that'd be interesting information if I could see.

452
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:54,929
Rym: That's not on the front page of a YouTube video anymore Like it used to be a lot more prominent when it was uploaded.

453
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:56,394
Rym: I think YouTube pulled that away.

454
00:29:56,414 --> 00:30:04,678
Scott: I don't know anyway, so This video is from 1998 right and basically what happened here is there was a hacking group.

455
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:05,240
Rym: Oh, it's still there.

456
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,622
Rym: I see it.

457
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:07,290
Scott: Well, it doesn't say it in the app.

458
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:08,255
Scott: What does it say other?

459
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,340
Rym: Oh, I'm not on that video.

460
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,123
Rym: Let me go to that video now.

461
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:11,067
Rym: I picked a random video.

462
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:18,070
Scott: I had YouTube open anyway, so this video is 14th 2011. it's a long time ago.

463
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,625
Rym: the videos from March May 19th 1998.

464
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,800
Scott: so this is there was a hacking group called loft heavy industries.

465
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:40,520
Scott: Obviously the O was a zero and F in loft was a pH And it was a big deal because these dudes with their hacker names like Brian oblivion kingpin space rogue Mudge weld pond Stefan one

466
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:41,865
Rym: Right

467
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:56,780
Scott: these dudes who are like the most stereotypical hackers you've ever seen testified before Congress And when the news reported on this in 1998. basically all the news said was Hackers testified before Congress and say they could take down the internet in 30 minutes.

468
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,774
Scott: But really there's a lot more than they testified to Congress.

469
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:02,259
Scott: and this was in a day when?

470
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:14,100
Scott: Congress was a little bit better than it is now Interviewing people and Getting you know asking them questions and trying to actually learn from them instead of you know being real dumb.

471
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:21,506
Scott: it was a little bit less corrupt than it is now and This is a really interesting congressional testimony.

472
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:32,760
Scott: if you're a nerd of any kind especially one who cares about technologies and You know it informs a lot of you know what our government thinks about technology these days.

473
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:35,915
Rym: Yeah, and I feel like the Gulf between.

474
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:36,960
Rym: I saw this a long time ago.

475
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,460
Rym: I haven't seen it recently, but if I it's think it just came back up again.

476
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,900
Rym: So I had it like well like my thing of the day on Monday is gonna be that elevator hacking thing from Defcon.

477
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,032
Rym: That thing's way old, but I came up in my feet.

478
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,319
Rym: I was like all right that thing.

479
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,950
Rym: fun fact they gave that lecture at the end of Defcon.

480
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,909
Rym: because imagine if you gave a lecture on how to hack elevators at the Beginning of a long convention of hackers.

481
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:59,478
Scott: I mean they could have fixed the elevators in that hotel.

482
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:07,397
Rym: and now The gist of that video is an Elevator is just an unsecured stairwell.

483
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:16,378
Scott: yes Also, if I was the person doing that presentation I would have during the presentation triggered the elevators in that hotel to do what I say.

484
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,714
Scott: yeah I've been like oh and as I'm speaking the elevators in this hotel are all going to the basement.

485
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:25,868
Rym: the elevators of this hotel have all Exited their shafts and our arms.

486
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:28,198
Scott: They're all going up to the roof with the doors open.

487
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:31,418
Rym: But what this video?

488
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:45,241
Rym: The as much as there's this wide gulf between the people testifying and the old men who don't know better interviewing them That Gulf is like four times wider today than it was back in 1998.

489
00:32:45,241 --> 00:32:46,927
Scott: Mm-hmm pretty much so.

490
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:54,478
Rym: in the moment the book club book will be Oryx and Craig by Margaret Atwood Even though the handmade sale would probably be more relevant to the current state of America possibly.

491
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:02,000
Rym: But I got to finish the last wheel of time book first so I can do that last special podcast with Kehil White at PAX Prime.

492
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,771
Rym: I'm halfway through the last book of the wheel of time.

493
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:06,976
Scott: tell me about the snake thief.

494
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:08,060
Rym: I know what's in that tower.

495
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,087
Rym: I know what the deal is for that tower.

496
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:14,160
Rym: I know what's up with Mazram tame that motherfucker.

497
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:16,146
Rym: I learned something interesting.

498
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:19,500
Rym: You know how the SNI can make up and bond a man as a water.

499
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:23,939
Rym: So the male wizards later they learn that they can bond a woman the same way.

500
00:33:24,823 --> 00:33:25,325
Scott: What a tubule.

501
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:27,091
Scott: bond each other at the same time.

502
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:32,486
Rym: so someone just did that and it's like Don't if that's bad idea.

503
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:34,573
Rym: Okay, that that that causes prop.

504
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:38,023
Rym: basically that happens by accident and It's it.

505
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:44,184
Rym: It's like if you see a script that was written poorly starts looping It's stuff goes down.

506
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:47,194
Rym: So yeah, I'm gonna know a lot about the wheel of time real soon.

507
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:48,960
Rym: The patreon is going strong.

508
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:54,431
Rym: I just uploaded and I'm gonna rapid-fire the rest of these now The second of the beta episodes of GeekNights.

509
00:33:54,491 --> 00:34:07,039
Rym: and the craziest thing is that as I upload these people who apparently have still been listening to GeekNights and hanging out in the forum who haven't posted or said anything for Five plus years are all coming out of the woodwork.

510
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:09,931
Rym: Some people who remember these episodes.

511
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:11,820
Scott: How could you remember some beta episode?

512
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:15,639
Rym: No, because our friends listened to all of them and gave us feedback.

513
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,100
Rym: Yeah Yeah What's great about this?

514
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,260
Rym: Is that the first one was pretty entertaining like the first thing we ever did just for various reasons.

515
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,263
Rym: You can hear my commentary.

516
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:31,060
Rym: the commentary that I did when I remastered them will be free for everyone not just patrons.

517
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,623
Rym: I'll update that.

518
00:34:31,643 --> 00:34:34,295
Rym: I'll upload that over the weekend as a public update.

519
00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:35,360
Rym: So you guys can hear the commentary.

520
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:50,793
Rym: What I'll say is this if listening to that first beta episode you were somehow under the misapprehension That we figured out what we were doing and made a good show like right away The second episode will disavow you of that illusion, I think it's.

521
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,780
Scott: you know, it's like penny arcade, right?

522
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,120
Scott: It's like yeah, first one's bad.

523
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,719
Scott: The only difference is that the current penny arcade is real good and the current GeekNights is still bad Just less bad.

524
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:01,679
Rym: We decided that we needed to argue more so than when we did this one.

525
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:10,635
Rym: like we start some bullshit arguments and then we get really mad at each other and just keep arguing and keep arguing and then At the end that this beautiful like don't listen to it.

526
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:11,480
Rym: It's actually really bad.

527
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,365
Rym: Just listen to the commentary.

528
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:21,500
Rym: but in the very very end of the file I Interrupt Scott and I'm like, you know what this episode got stupid Just cut it off and then Scott says you're the one who made it stupid.

529
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,754
Rym: You started one of your arguments and literally I say what do you mean?

530
00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:26,096
Rym: What?

531
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:27,280
Rym: and then the audio cuts out?

532
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,060
Rym: Like I Imagine we must have argued for another hour or two after that.

533
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,200
Rym: I can't imagine that we didn't and we didn't record it, but it was tough to listen to this one.

534
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,450
Rym: We don't know shit because we're arguing about shit.

535
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,515
Rym: We don't know shit about.

536
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:43,520
Scott: what did we argue about?

537
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:49,960
Rym: You argued that there is no culture of anti-intellectualism in the United States, that's wrong.

538
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:53,433
Rym: Yeah, and I made it all up and in credit.

539
00:35:53,473 --> 00:35:54,136
Scott: That's what I said.

540
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:54,959
Scott: Are you not putting words?

541
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,483
Scott: Yeah Why would I say that?

542
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:59,351
Scott: Yeah, so the United States is nothing.

543
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:09,117
Rym: but you and I also talk and argue about politics a lot but we Like we get way out of the shit We know and we clearly do not know a lot.

544
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:13,040
Rym: at one point We both start talking about what language or languages might be spoken in India.

545
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:18,181
Rym: Let me tell you we're real dumb in 2005.

546
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:21,691
Scott: Listen, people don't learn things by being young.

547
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:22,313
Scott: Yep.

548
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:24,500
Scott: This is what it's relevant.

549
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:30,220
Scott: I was watching Simpsons clips the other day, whatever the age I am is the age you are when you're the smartest.

550
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:35,220
Rym: This is one clip where like the producer for itchy and scratchy just comes in to a focus group.

551
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,629
Rym: But he's like you.

552
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,263
Rym: kids are all stupid Stupid.

553
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:40,228
Rym: you don't know what you want.

554
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:42,420
Rym: That's why you're young because you're stupid.

555
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,427
Rym: So we'd had some ideas.

556
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,170
Rym: what did the show on?

557
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,690
Rym: we actually considered just doing a whole show on Muhammad Ali But I figured you're better.

558
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:53,900
Rym: you're better served by reading his Wikipedia page.

559
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,180
Scott: You're better served by just YouTube for like until the crack of dawn.

560
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,999
Scott: I mean, yep, once you start watching, you know Muhammad Ali do anything you're gonna be watching for like days.

561
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:03,544
Rym: Yeah, like.

562
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:06,720
Rym: I really wish I could have met him or hung out with him or just talk to him.

563
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:08,056
Scott: I'd have been happy to talk to you.

564
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,189
Rym: Anyway.

565
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:14,756
Rym: So I tweeted earlier today at 1151 a.m What should we do the show on tonight?

566
00:37:14,796 --> 00:37:16,762
Rym: I got a lot of Suggestions.

567
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:17,685
Rym: I'm just gonna go through these.

568
00:37:18,006 --> 00:37:20,616
Rym: we're gonna pick one if all of them are bad.

569
00:37:20,676 --> 00:37:21,540
Rym: This is your fault.

570
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:22,816
Rym: internet.

571
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,589
Rym: Andrew Milim said Syria.

572
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:27,480
Rym: Oh, I don't think so.

573
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,930
Rym: My response to him was quote.

574
00:37:29,252 --> 00:37:36,580
Rym: if I had to make a list of things God is least willing to talk about either on GeekNights or in real life I'll talk about Syria.

575
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:41,616
Rym: See oh you want to not tell that the Assyrians came down like the wolf on the fold.

576
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:42,963
Rym: the courts are gleaming in purple and Gold.

577
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:47,552
Rym: Yes that guy Real like current Assyria like that region politics.

578
00:37:47,592 --> 00:37:49,660
Rym: or do you actually know about old ancient Assyria?

579
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,855
Scott: I know about fictional ancient Assyria.

580
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:54,818
Scott: All right That fought that fought with fictional Jews.

581
00:37:57,261 --> 00:37:57,824
Rym: I'd be interested.

582
00:37:57,844 --> 00:38:00,900
Scott: show on ham radio, but I don't know much about ham radio.

583
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:05,032
Scott: I can tell you that in summer camp There was you could you know where they had every nerdy thing.

584
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:10,396
Scott: ham radio was one of the nerdy thing And it's pretty much only the old grog nard types to do ham radio.

585
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,300
Scott: Not a lot of young people.

586
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:17,889
Rym: It's the kind of thing where I hope that a few people I know Are into it enough cuz it's like say Mad Max or something crazy happens.

587
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,096
Rym: that shit gets really useful real quick.

588
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:28,953
Rym: Yeah, otherwise I was actually really into radio as a kid But I didn't have the money or the time or the inclination to do ham.

589
00:38:28,993 --> 00:38:30,780
Scott: just use like CB radios the truckers use.

590
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,001
Rym: I was about to say I actually I was a CB radio hobbyist Like.

591
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:38,437
Rym: I had all these different crystals and I had a base station with a fucking big antenna.

592
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:39,320
Rym: There's probably illegal.

593
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:43,319
Scott: I mean if I see the apocalypse corners buy some on Amazon or bust into a truck and take it.

594
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,055
Rym: I had random just conversations with truckers driving by like.

595
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:51,735
Rym: I learned a whole bunch of stuff I used to know more about like radio etiquette back then.

596
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:52,860
Scott: because yeah, no one cares.

597
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:55,331
Rym: Yeah, but I don't have enough.

598
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:56,778
Scott: go watch contact next.

599
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,927
Rym: Conspiracy theories.

600
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:01,539
Scott: don't believe in the next.

601
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,064
Rym: Terminator 1 vs.

602
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:06,007
Rym: Terminator 2.

603
00:39:06,007 --> 00:39:07,312
Scott: Terminator 2 is a better movie next.

604
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:08,677
Rym: Terminator 1 was a good movie though.

605
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:09,500
Scott: Yeah, it was not bad.

606
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,780
Scott: I know we could do wasn't even half as good.

607
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,792
Rym: We ever actually do a show on Terminator 2.

608
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:19,420
Rym: I watched it in a couple years up Sometime down the road like when it's bad outside.

609
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:23,500
Rym: Let's watch the two Terminator movies and then review them as Thursday episodes.

610
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:25,345
Rym: We do a lot in Jurassic Park.

611
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,651
Scott: We can do a Terminator show on all things Terminator.

612
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:29,135
Rym: You have the two movies.

613
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:29,898
Rym: Yeah.

614
00:39:30,178 --> 00:39:34,480
Scott: Yeah exactly Ah.

615
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:36,785
Scott: Also the Terminator 2 video game.

616
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:40,640
Rym: Matt offered to do a guest episode and do a review of the state of New Jersey.

617
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:42,849
Rym: Call him we could review the state of New York.

618
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,713
Scott: call him right now.

619
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:45,340
Rym: He said he's busy playing overwatch.

620
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:47,308
Scott: I think that means he can call him right now.

621
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:50,320
Rym: Luke's Bert Luke Burge suggested driving just driving.

622
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,259
Rym: I don't think we ever did a show on that.

623
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:52,759
Scott: It's fun, but don't do it.

624
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,060
Rym: If you don't have to don't have anything to say about I could tell you I do a whole show on driving.

625
00:39:56,584 --> 00:39:58,680
Rym: I had anecdotes about like we've done this already.

626
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,610
Rym: We might have I don't know and also future transport like the future of transportation and driving Car will drive itself and hopefully so.

627
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,127
Rym: actually that presents some problems though I was thinking about this a couple weeks ago.

628
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:12,716
Rym: self-driving cars are great, right?

629
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:15,717
Rym: Yeah here There's one drawback to them right now.

630
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:25,159
Rym: If you're if you're one of those terrible people who insists on living in the suburbs and driving an hour to work every day At least you're punished for it with a horrible commute.

631
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:41,719
Rym: If you have self-driving cars will probably quadruple the traffic and all those shitty like suburban towns Will be full of commuters driving to work like riding to work in their pods and will probably actually make Closer in mass transit and like city infrastructure worse in the short term.

632
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:44,424
Scott: I don't think so.

633
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:45,648
Rym: Why not?

634
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:49,845
Rym: I mean, I don't know like this is something I've thought about but I haven't really formed Just concrete opinion on it.

635
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:54,386
Scott: I mean just cuz you're not driving the car It's still gonna be.

636
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:55,791
Scott: if it's still being to be traffic.

637
00:40:55,832 --> 00:41:01,330
Scott: if there's too many of them more than the road can handle Right, yeah, but will it self-driving cars?

638
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,055
Rym: will they just increase the like?

639
00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:04,600
Rym: will they overload the road?

640
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:10,140
Scott: Also people are gonna like get in those cars together because you're not gonna like want to own one because that's that defeats the point.

641
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,589
Scott: You're not gonna have right old cars, right?

642
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:14,232
Scott: So you just got a car will be on your street somewhere You'll get in it.

643
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,806
Rym: But I guess there's a wider battle.

644
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:18,921
Scott: improve society by making people socialize with each other like.

645
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:22,512
Rym: will it reduce the need for mass bulk local transport?

646
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:28,020
Rym: or will it cause an explosion of Towns like beacon that are kind of sleeper communities?

647
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:35,414
Scott: Well, I mean just come here even if people stop getting on the Metro North first of all Right, the thing could just take you to the Metro North because then what the fuck is the difference?

648
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:36,720
Scott: whether it takes you to?

649
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,700
Scott: The train or not, right?

650
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,400
Scott: But also the cars used to all hook up to each other and make a train in which case it's just a fucking train.

651
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:43,486
Scott: It just has a lot more wheels.

652
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:44,069
Scott: What's the difference?

653
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:57,987
Rym: Yeah, and actually what one thing, you know the my counterpoint like my counter argument to that idea and Is that think about what happened in a lot of the developing world where they never had phone infrastructure and Then they leapt to cell phones.

654
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,700
Rym: So they skipped like one generation of bullshit.

655
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:04,820
Rym: It's like in Civ 5 when like I build a bunch of bullshit spearmen.

656
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:09,620
Rym: But what if you just don't build spearmen you get to the point of making pike men?

657
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,587
Rym: You skip a whole generation save a ton of money and just make like the good stuff, you know That's what I would have done.

658
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,272
Scott: Yeah, you know if I had money right now I could have like a knight but I instead I have a horseman.

659
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,478
Scott: because not cuz I don't know how.

660
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,786
Scott: to night I haven't played.

661
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:32,634
Scott: I've always armor sitting around but the armorsmith one I know how to make it you don't and I'm like, dude Listen, your whole blacksmith shop this whole town's gonna get burnt to the ground.

662
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:34,020
Scott: If you don't just give me some free armor.

663
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:36,308
Scott: We have so much iron.

664
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,655
Scott: Just give me free armor.

665
00:42:38,017 --> 00:42:38,600
Scott: No, you got to pay.

666
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:43,077
Rym: You don't have that many humans living in your cities because I I have my one city.

667
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:43,940
Rym: I have three cities.

668
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,560
Rym: I'm gonna have a fourth reel soon and all three of them have more population than your capital.

669
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:51,214
Scott: Yeah, I couldn't get because I basically lived in a desert place.

670
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:51,616
Scott: There's not.

671
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:52,420
Scott: there wasn't enough food.

672
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:54,119
Rym: Yeah, you think I started in a good place?

673
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:54,801
Scott: I had.

674
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:58,800
Scott: no I still have like so low food, even though I got the tradition plus food capital.

675
00:42:58,861 --> 00:43:00,999
Rym: I feel like we should start the fourth game.

676
00:43:01,425 --> 00:43:06,034
Rym: I feel like that also but we can let this one go until like it's over we could start the fourth game.

677
00:43:06,054 --> 00:43:09,930
Scott: because if we start thinking I'm thinking someone who Was war based and duels only war matters.

678
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:12,340
Rym: Uh, I was not going to war you at any point.

679
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:14,069
Rym: I had never planned on actually invading you.

680
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:15,918
Rym: The only reason I'm going to is to end this.

681
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:18,667
Rym: I Was planning almost.

682
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:19,630
Rym: I made all those videos.

683
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:25,156
Rym: you could have left my caravans alone then that was a like 2007 era GeekNights tangent.

684
00:43:25,176 --> 00:43:28,023
Rym: I Posit that.

685
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,449
Rym: possibly the fact that the u.s.

686
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:37,268
Rym: Never had mass transit anywhere except New York City pretty much Might and we built all these highways.

687
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:48,054
Rym: if we jump to self-driving cars Suddenly skip over bullet train every single highway We built becomes mass transit and America has this explosion.

688
00:43:48,074 --> 00:44:00,543
Rym: We have this amazing infrastructure Except for all the bridges that are collapsing But suddenly it turns into mass transit like there might be a renaissance in America if we survive the next 20 years of our infrastructure Collapsing.

689
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:01,045
Rym: Mm-hmm.

690
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:01,749
Rym: We'll see.

691
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:03,900
Scott: That's it's very optimistic.

692
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:10,560
Scott: It doesn't matter because it's here's the problem even if that if what you say is true.

693
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:13,813
Scott: Right, the self-driving car doesn't go 500 miles an hour.

694
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:14,495
Scott: Like the bullet train.

695
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:15,620
Scott: does you need the bullet train?

696
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,021
Scott: You can't.

697
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:16,945
Rym: why do you need the bullet train?

698
00:44:16,965 --> 00:44:20,160
Scott: for so I can get somewhere in less than fucking 10 hours?

699
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:21,949
Rym: Yeah, where are you gonna go?

700
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,079
Rym: Where do we go?

701
00:44:23,582 --> 00:44:26,840
Scott: We go to Boston in a self-driving cars takes for fuck ever.

702
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,760
Rym: So there should be bullet trains along the Northeast corridor and along the west coast, but nowhere else.

703
00:44:33,343 --> 00:44:35,820
Scott: I mean there should be one that just goes across the whole goddamn country.

704
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,728
Scott: Why can't I take the train to California?

705
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:38,531
Rym: who would ride that?

706
00:44:38,652 --> 00:44:40,500
Rym: flying is actually way better at that?

707
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:44,079
Scott: I mean the train is used less energy and goes just as fast.

708
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,327
Scott: How fast does the plane fly?

709
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:47,473
Scott: about 500 miles an hour?

710
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:48,660
Scott: How fast does the bullet train go?

711
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,030
Scott: You know if the bullet train was going through like the middle of the nowhere that is the middle of America It could go probably even faster than 500.

712
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,800
Scott: It could probably go six or seven hundred.

713
00:44:57,902 --> 00:44:59,111
Rym: I'm not even gonna touch that one.

714
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:00,200
Rym: I'm just gonna let that stand.

715
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:05,100
Scott: You don't think that the really long train uses less energy than the plane that has to not only go forward but also go up?

716
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:10,020
Rym: I don't think bullet trains are the solution to Transcontinental.

717
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:15,940
Scott: You think that like a nuclear power plant hooked up to like maglev rail is less efficient than a jet engine?

718
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:18,778
Rym: I think planes are still better at that.

719
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:23,771
Rym: Also, you never saw the train movie right?

720
00:45:24,052 --> 00:45:25,396
Rym: which one the truth.

721
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:29,936
Rym: There's only one train movie Galaxy Express 9 9 9. there's only one train movie.

722
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:39,694
Rym: That's not animated Trains planes automobiles That's also planes and automobiles and actually that that movie is mostly cars.

723
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:42,000
Scott: so the general with Buster Keaton.

724
00:45:44,768 --> 00:45:46,057
Rym: Yeah, I guess that is also a train movie.

725
00:45:46,137 --> 00:45:48,315
Rym: anyway That's the only train movies.

726
00:45:48,436 --> 00:45:55,149
Scott: I know deciding what restaurant to eat at The one we're deciding what to do the show on.

727
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:57,015
Rym: that's Chris Reimer suggested.

728
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:58,279
Scott: You've done that already did we?

729
00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:01,731
Scott: yes We've done that like a hundred times.

730
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:02,800
Scott: we've done this exact episode.

731
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,463
Scott: We're doing now 100 times.

732
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:04,286
Scott: No this episode.

733
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:05,069
Rym: We're actually doing.

734
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,154
Rym: we're doing though.

735
00:46:06,174 --> 00:46:08,685
Rym: We're I don't think we've done one That was stated goal.

736
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:11,498
Rym: We're just going to do a show on how we decide what to do the show on.

737
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:13,279
Rym: I think we've ever done that.

738
00:46:13,661 --> 00:46:16,010
Scott: This is what it sounds like to decide what to do the show on.

739
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,656
Rym: we we do a bring up.

740
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:18,860
Scott: we bring up crab people.

741
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:20,410
Rym: We do a one to two minute show.

742
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,819
Scott: I reject most of them.

743
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:27,395
Scott: Oh We find the least the the most tolerable crab people and then we settle on it.

744
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:30,654
Rym: the threshold for what's tolerable Continues to drop the hungrier.

745
00:46:30,694 --> 00:46:35,977
Rym: we are Deciding what restaurant to eat that actually could be a good show to do.

746
00:46:36,118 --> 00:46:36,259
Rym: not.

747
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:37,892
Scott: now I don't think we could do 20 minutes.

748
00:46:38,114 --> 00:46:38,679
Rym: I think we could.

749
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,906
Rym: So here's the topics.

750
00:46:41,087 --> 00:46:46,592
Rym: all right, so here's how I'll give you guys this cuz we're not gonna Do this show on this cuz this show is actually almost done.

751
00:46:46,933 --> 00:46:48,440
Rym: We've been going for like 50 minutes.

752
00:46:49,901 --> 00:47:02,008
Rym: There's the one the problem of like conventions like deciding where to eat forming the group of people to eat splitting up the group's reservations how everyone just fucking sucks at that and You know there's a lot to say.

753
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,039
Rym: there's probably like eight minutes of stuff on that.

754
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,876
Rym: There's us ourselves and how much easier that got.

755
00:47:07,896 --> 00:47:14,240
Rym: we moved to New York And there's literally like 30 restaurants within a 15-minute travel of our apartment plus grow up hub.

756
00:47:15,683 --> 00:47:17,294
Rym: But you could grow up from multiple places.

757
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,100
Rym: deal with the picky people.

758
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:21,934
Rym: We could talk about the picky people and how you just need to cut them out of your group.

759
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:23,821
Scott: or don't be don't be picky Babies.

760
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:28,194
Scott: if you're gonna be picky then look I don't like certain things right?

761
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,100
Scott: you know everyone doesn't like certain things.

762
00:47:30,702 --> 00:47:39,312
Scott: But if like if I go to a restaurant for example like I'm not really into Radish and like you know radishes.

763
00:47:39,352 --> 00:47:40,780
Rym: There's a restaurant that has just radish.

764
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,290
Scott: I mean radish is okay, but like I will never buy a radish.

765
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,700
Scott: I'll never intentionally put a radish in my food, right?

766
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:57,923
Scott: I won't order a radish focused dish at a restaurant But if I get a salad if I get a salad and there's mad radish on it or even moderate radish on it You know what I fucking eat it cuz I'm not a child Right.

767
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:10,165
Scott: so when you so when you go to a restaurant if you have like celiac disease or an allergy and you say no Bread, please that's absolutely acceptable, but if you say no radish You're a fucking baby.

768
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:12,774
Scott: Just fucking eat it or order something else now.

769
00:48:12,854 --> 00:48:13,696
Rym: It is one thing.

770
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,762
Rym: Let's say the Like.

771
00:48:15,782 --> 00:48:21,050
Rym: the menu listed the things in it, and it didn't list radish and yet radish was a significant component.

772
00:48:22,793 --> 00:48:28,586
Rym: I Even asked like hey, what's in this?

773
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:32,580
Rym: and they still like didn't mention radish even once and then it's just like covered in radishes.

774
00:48:32,962 --> 00:48:35,074
Scott: That's a little weird and bad restaurant.

775
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:35,940
Scott: Don't go there again.

776
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,638
Rym: I've run into those situations before but it hasn't happened since I moved to New York.

777
00:48:40,682 --> 00:48:42,828
Rym: There's also so there's a side topic there.

778
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:43,791
Rym: I noticed something.

779
00:48:44,192 --> 00:48:57,659
Rym: This is a problem that I never considered specifically in this context until the last Pac South Because remember we needed to find a place to eat and everyone was crowded and had a long wait.

780
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:05,530
Rym: And pass like San Antonio is one of those weird places where despite being crowded Restaurants will take reservations, which I think is ludicrous.

781
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,147
Rym: like if you're a good restaurant, and you're like filling reliably You should never take reservations.

782
00:49:09,187 --> 00:49:11,040
Scott: No need to take a reservation like in New York.

783
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,113
Rym: No good restaurant except the super super upper-end places that are so expensive.

784
00:49:15,133 --> 00:49:15,955
Rym: They don't fail.

785
00:49:16,216 --> 00:49:23,053
Rym: like no one takes reservations You're just like stand outside for an hour if you want to eat a salt and fat Yep, or go it like the worst possible time.

786
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:24,400
Scott: It's like they're gonna fill all their seats.

787
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:27,507
Rym: They don't need your reservation And we had a constraint of.

788
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:30,899
Rym: we had a pretty large group of like 12 people and we all want to eat together.

789
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:37,911
Scott: now in The old days like I think everyone else always wants to everyone eat together I'm happy to just eat and it's like just split up guys.

790
00:49:37,951 --> 00:49:38,433
Scott: make it easy.

791
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:38,634
Rym: Well.

792
00:49:38,654 --> 00:49:39,900
Rym: That's it in the old days.

793
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,803
Scott: Just go ever.

794
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:51,518
Rym: we would like put great effort into being able to all eat together and I've decided that that is always a wasted effort especially at like a convention or whatever.

795
00:49:51,538 --> 00:49:52,040
Rym: right.

796
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:53,526
Rym: But there's a side thing.

797
00:49:53,847 --> 00:50:03,757
Rym: we found a place that would seat all of us immediately and We got a giant table and that seemed fine and in fact I noticed this happen a bunch of times.

798
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:04,480
Rym: in San Antonio.

799
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,479
Rym: There were restaurants that had the seating to accommodate a giant group of people.

800
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:19,279
Rym: However Places like that places that aren't like New York or Chicago that have a huge population of people doing that sort of thing all the time They have slow kitchens.

801
00:50:20,181 --> 00:50:25,239
Rym: They're never going to have a kitchen that could actually deliver that much food in time.

802
00:50:25,741 --> 00:50:35,819
Rym: So you run in the situation in San Antonio where you'll find a restaurant that will seat all 20 of you right now And then it'll take them literally an hour and a half to bring out your food.

803
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,950
Rym: So that's a further no new argument.

804
00:50:40,432 --> 00:50:42,800
Rym: one don't go to places in cities that aren't New York.

805
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,628
Scott: Oh, you got 12 people right.

806
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,500
Scott: don't even go up and be like we got 12, and we can split up.

807
00:50:47,621 --> 00:50:49,760
Scott: No, just say we got fo table four.

808
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,025
Scott: We got three tables before.

809
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:51,386
Scott: now.

810
00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:56,069
Rym: the drama problem is that usually in any in any large towns You don't know each other.

811
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:56,616
Scott: fo fo fo.

812
00:50:57,442 --> 00:51:00,051
Scott: Well in any large group, you know you didn't get my fo fo fo.

813
00:51:00,072 --> 00:51:01,035
Rym: I got your fo fo fo.

814
00:51:01,336 --> 00:51:02,300
Scott: yo you get that reference.

815
00:51:02,381 --> 00:51:02,806
Scott: I think so.

816
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:03,798
Scott: What is that reference from?

817
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:05,985
Rym: There's nothing with Ross's.

818
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,090
Rym: got it a Ross right?

819
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:08,335
Rym: no no I got nothing.

820
00:51:08,355 --> 00:51:09,400
Scott: then it's a basketball right?

821
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:12,475
Rym: I don't know what the fuck that is that I don't watch basketball.

822
00:51:12,515 --> 00:51:15,674
Rym: I don't like basketball I don't know anything about basketball.

823
00:51:15,694 --> 00:51:16,379
Rym: and I go ahead.

824
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:23,017
Rym: I'm bad at basketball - like real bad at it like Preternaturally bad at basketball if you watch me try to play like it's awful.

825
00:51:23,218 --> 00:51:26,583
Rym: continue Right.

826
00:51:26,603 --> 00:51:33,440
Rym: if you have it like sometimes like the front row crew like when like in the old days like when we'd all get together We all want to go to the same restaurant.

827
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,831
Rym: Everyone wanted to sit with everyone else like we were all chills.

828
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:40,600
Rym: if we split up it literally didn't matter who sat with who?

829
00:51:41,866 --> 00:52:02,060
Rym: but Usually if you out there or are at a convention Or you have a large group of friends, and you all decide you want to get out together There are definitely a lot of people who don't actually want to share the table with certain other people Like there's the newer friends Stuck with like the second tier people like they want to sit with the prime people.

830
00:52:02,444 --> 00:52:03,819
Rym: They want to sit at the cool table.

831
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:06,089
Rym: It always ends up being the hierarchy of like.

832
00:52:06,371 --> 00:52:08,540
Rym: there's two tables were like cool crafts happening.

833
00:52:09,003 --> 00:52:11,879
Rym: Then there's the table with all the people who aren't like super in the group.

834
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:16,475
Rym: And then there's the table with like the super annoying CPM who somehow is in your group.

835
00:52:16,555 --> 00:52:17,438
Rym: You couldn't get rid of them.

836
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:26,820
Rym: and There I think we could do a whole show on how to file like how to decide where to eat How to deal with small and large groups, I think we do a whole show Thursday.

837
00:52:28,703 --> 00:52:29,747
Scott: Hmm what I wasn't listening.

838
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,272
Rym: I think people would listen.

839
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:31,955
Rym: I think you would like it.

840
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:33,079
Scott: I wasn't listening to you.

841
00:52:33,461 --> 00:52:34,366
Rym: Okay, what were you doing?

842
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:35,029
Scott: reading some internet?

843
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:35,673
Rym: Okay?

844
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:36,799
Rym: Uh?

845
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:37,692
Rym: Indy car.

846
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,504
Rym: It's car racing.

847
00:52:39,644 --> 00:52:40,628
Rym: I don't know enough about it.

848
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:44,442
Rym: That's mostly died frequent flyer programs And like.

849
00:52:44,483 --> 00:52:48,200
Rym: so like the jet blue stuff or the I guess the bolt bus thing.

850
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,023
Rym: I'm member of that.

851
00:52:49,043 --> 00:52:53,280
Scott: I get free rides from all the time you do it a lot, and then you get free shit.

852
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:54,250
Scott: What's there today?

853
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:59,339
Rym: I mean The airplane stuff kind of matters because that's how I get like upgrades.

854
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:05,181
Scott: yeah You can get a lot of you can get more value you get a large amount of values worth and a lot of people do It.

855
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:09,900
Scott: I don't understand why companies Allow their individual employees to keep those benefits.

856
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,954
Rym: I would not fucking fly anywhere ever if my company didn't let me keep my air miles.

857
00:53:14,195 --> 00:53:15,238
Rym: I would refuse mm-hmm.

858
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:18,773
Scott: That's why yeah like if I'm a company.

859
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,440
Scott: I'm like fly here, or you're fired.

860
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,505
Scott: It's your job to fly there.

861
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:23,915
Rym: no except literally no no one would do it.

862
00:53:24,277 --> 00:53:29,673
Rym: pretty much Partly the accounts are usually tied to individuals like the corporate there.

863
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,880
Rym: usually they'll be like a corporate pool and weird stuff.

864
00:53:32,061 --> 00:53:39,460
Rym: But generally no you you use your own air miles But at the same time your company might say you're not like you can't buy that ticket.

865
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,276
Rym: That's I know you want to fly Delta or whatever, but that ticket cost twice as much.

866
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:46,398
Rym: fuck you you're flying jet blue whatever.

867
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:48,996
Rym: uh One thing I can say is that I've seen people who?

868
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,920
Rym: Try to min max it and spend a lot of time like trying to game those systems.

869
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:55,103
Scott: Spent that time working.

870
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:56,026
Rym: yeah, don't bother.

871
00:53:56,066 --> 00:54:07,300
Rym: the only the only time it is worth your while to like buy air miles There's some nonsense like that is if you're already in the wealthy class because then like it actually is cheaper than buying business class.

872
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,227
Rym: You're already wealthy though.

873
00:54:08,368 --> 00:54:09,940
Scott: Does why do you even need to save fucking money?

874
00:54:10,702 --> 00:54:11,166
Rym: I'm not.

875
00:54:11,186 --> 00:54:12,800
Rym: I didn't get rich by wasting money.

876
00:54:14,202 --> 00:54:15,693
Scott: Scrooge McDuck would do that kind of shit.

877
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:16,680
Rym: I would do that.

878
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:26,773
Rym: I mean I do that a little bit like I have all my frequent flyers stuff and I might buy a bunch of miles on Cathey for next year so that Emily and I can just fly business class.

879
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:31,399
Rym: if we go to Australia like something like that Do whatever you want be way cheaper than buying a business class ticket.

880
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:39,890
Rym: Vaporwave I'm not gonna talk about vaporwave for if it doesn't exist Comixology changing subscription model, I just don't use Comixology.

881
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,114
Scott: I don't use that either.

882
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:44,865
Rym: I would but I Read books on my Kindle instead.

883
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:50,765
Scott: I read comic books on paper not because I'm obviously not anti Digital read things.

884
00:54:51,066 --> 00:54:52,732
Scott: I would much rather read things digitally.

885
00:54:53,153 --> 00:54:58,198
Scott: but comics at least, you know most of the ones I read were made with paper in mind.

886
00:54:58,218 --> 00:55:10,052
Scott: and Unlike say reading a book digitally, which there's not really any fucking difference If a comic book was made for paper and then you read it digitally That's like watching a widescreen movie on a 4/3 TV.

887
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:11,096
Scott: It doesn't work.

888
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,186
Rym: Ah All right home organization systems.

889
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:16,975
Rym: I get a lot of thoughts to unpack on that one.

890
00:55:17,035 --> 00:55:18,359
Rym: So get it.

891
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:19,526
Scott: It's not funny.

892
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,312
Rym: That was real funny.

893
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:23,906
Rym: No music Talked about music.

894
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,496
Scott: It's too general music.

895
00:55:25,536 --> 00:55:28,969
Rym: We like Almost all of it music.

896
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:31,559
Scott: We particularly like almost all of it.

897
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:39,747
Rym: you gotta have something like if you like if you're like a B test like it's in a Monomart song and Pretty good, like a Beatles song pretty good.

898
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:43,738
Rym: Like what if you had to pick one like prioritize which song is it?

899
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,426
Rym: Yeah It's got to be somebody's like.

900
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:48,758
Rym: I don't like a lot of modern R&B.

901
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:52,281
Rym: that much Depends.

902
00:55:52,502 --> 00:55:59,720
Scott: but they see like that's a very narrow any any any genre that you pick out and you And you try to tell me I don't like that genre.

903
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:05,806
Scott: I'll find you like some songs in that genre that are so awesome because I think what I really like like What about country or Western?

904
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:06,670
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

905
00:56:06,771 --> 00:56:08,640
Scott: I like some country songs.

906
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:14,040
Scott: I like songs with a strong melodic hook regardless of sound like, you know what?

907
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,785
Rym: I think Garth Brooks like Thunder rolls.

908
00:56:16,046 --> 00:56:19,096
Rym: That's just like a twangy country kind of cliche song.

909
00:56:19,457 --> 00:56:20,300
Rym: It's not a bad song.

910
00:56:20,922 --> 00:56:21,363
Rym: I like it.

911
00:56:21,885 --> 00:56:35,924
Scott: like you could take the same exact song and have some you know like Dolly Parton sing it and then have say I don't know I used to earth sing it and I'll probably if it's a good song.

912
00:56:35,964 --> 00:56:36,826
Scott: I'll like it both ways.

913
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:37,648
Scott: It was a bad song.

914
00:56:37,668 --> 00:56:38,530
Scott: I'll hate it both ways.

915
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:47,306
Rym: I Don't like the subject matter Like if it's the same like.

916
00:56:47,346 --> 00:56:51,119
Scott: yeah, I tend to listen to more foreign or non lyrical music.

917
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:57,502
Scott: Cuz then you can't hear the awful lyrics right because I won't hear awful lyrics Right.

918
00:56:57,884 --> 00:57:02,080
Scott: and awful lyrics include things that are just like, you know awful.

919
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:05,900
Scott: You know gangster rap that I run into that pretty often.

920
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:14,506
Rym: I like a lot of rap and hip-hop and yet the lyrics to the some of the songs that I really enjoy are Fucking awful, right?

921
00:57:14,526 --> 00:57:14,707
Scott: It's like.

922
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:15,270
Scott: it's one thing.

923
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,500
Scott: if you're sir mix a lot and you're like, I like big butts.

924
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,235
Scott: It's like I. everyone like big butts.

925
00:57:19,275 --> 00:57:19,719
Scott: That's great.

926
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:25,035
Scott: And then if someone's like, you know, I'm gonna kill people and rape all the ladies.

927
00:57:25,115 --> 00:57:25,376
Scott: It's like.

928
00:57:25,396 --> 00:57:26,660
Scott: no nobody like like.

929
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:35,312
Rym: There's a simpson wave song I like and it samples just takes to the big butts and at one point the guys like if life's A game inches then my dick something.

930
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:36,176
Rym: something's like really?

931
00:57:36,196 --> 00:57:39,449
Rym: I'm Wish I hadn't picked out that one part of the song.

932
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:39,830
Rym: is there?

933
00:57:39,891 --> 00:57:41,657
Scott: is there a karaoke version of this song?

934
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:42,260
Scott: because I've done.

935
00:57:42,982 --> 00:57:44,026
Rym: Are you looking what the song is?

936
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,692
Rym: Cuz I actually didn't recognize it at first.

937
00:57:46,515 --> 00:57:46,916
Scott: and it's like.

938
00:57:46,936 --> 00:57:47,599
Scott: it's pretty.

Scott: you know What you can make some some badass hippin and hoppin.

940
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:53,194
Scott: Yeah, right without having nasty lyrics.

941
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:56,565
Scott: you for example a recent example Turn down for what.

942
00:57:56,605 --> 00:57:57,067
Scott: what's wrong?

943
00:57:57,268 --> 00:57:58,634
Scott: All right, you could just say turn down for what.

944
00:57:58,654 --> 00:58:00,100
Scott: you could have a crazy ridiculous video.

945
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,105
Scott: That's like a modern.

946
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:03,115
Scott: I like big butts, right?

947
00:58:03,819 --> 00:58:08,134
Rym: I Unabashedly like turned down for Will Smith's bubblegum rap.

948
00:58:08,597 --> 00:58:13,155
Rym: I like Will Smith Like that shit way more than you would expect me to.

949
00:58:13,255 --> 00:58:14,500
Scott: we live it in the will any of you.

950
00:58:17,855 --> 00:58:22,195
Rym: If only he'd make good movies again, uh You don't need to if I was.

951
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:24,222
Scott: Will Smith is one of the smart people who's like I'm done.

952
00:58:24,242 --> 00:58:25,466
Scott: Yeah, I'm so rich.

953
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:30,044
Rym: Fuck y'all Music me if I didn't say what I'm listening to the most right now, though.

954
00:58:30,064 --> 00:58:31,090
Rym: It's actually legit.

955
00:58:31,732 --> 00:58:34,777
Scott: Simpson wave Right now today.

956
00:58:34,898 --> 00:58:46,082
Scott: I listened to so low-end Entertainment which is like one of the major kpop labels made a deal with Spotify So all of these past albums and things that were never on there.

957
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:48,350
Scott: It was like a huge dump of like new whatever, right?

958
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:59,742
Scott: So but right now I think XO just came back and as usual They have one good song and an album full of crap songs and one good song but they're like the biggest deal in the world at least for other people.

959
00:58:59,843 --> 00:59:05,915
Scott: and then I listened to like The vorjax 9 6 or 9.

960
00:59:05,915 --> 00:59:07,983
Rym: symphony is probably the one you're thinking of.

961
00:59:08,124 --> 00:59:09,650
Scott: I'd bow but I think they put on Spotify.

962
00:59:09,811 --> 00:59:10,638
Scott: There might have been this.

963
00:59:10,698 --> 00:59:12,090
Scott: I forget which one that went on Spotify.

964
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,060
Rym: Yeah, if you really like him, you should.

965
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,206
Scott: he's my number one guy.

966
00:59:15,326 --> 00:59:16,010
Rym: You should go back.

967
00:59:16,231 --> 00:59:17,319
Rym: Do you like piano concertos?

968
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:18,810
Rym: Do you want like the big orchestra there?

969
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:20,273
Scott: I don't really care.

970
00:59:20,674 --> 00:59:22,539
Rym: go listen to a bunch of Franz Liszt.

971
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:23,922
Scott: I already listened to Franz Liszt.

972
00:59:24,003 --> 00:59:25,507
Scott: Okay teaching me anything new here.

973
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:29,122
Rym: Uh You have you ever gone deep into the Rachmaninoff?

974
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:31,874
Rym: I don't like Rachmaninoff as much But how do you like Liszt?

975
00:59:31,894 --> 00:59:33,339
Rym: but knock rock not Rachmaninoff?

976
00:59:33,419 --> 00:59:33,880
Rym: It's different.

977
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:35,305
Rym: What what did you describe?

978
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:36,630
Rym: how they're different at least?

979
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:41,182
Rym: Is more superficial like tone-poem nonsense.

980
00:59:41,283 --> 00:59:49,475
Rym: Like this is a song about a painting I'm looking at at least Rachmaninoff has the crazy skill depth of the piano part The ones I.

981
00:59:49,515 --> 00:59:51,744
Scott: the one I really don't like the most is Vivaldi.

982
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:52,567
Scott: That's my.

983
00:59:52,608 --> 00:59:55,984
Rym: it's my not Vivaldi's good background music, I guess.

984
00:59:56,728 --> 01:00:00,790
Scott: Yeah, whatever I'm really into lately the kind of music they play in the clothing store.

985
01:00:01,253 --> 01:00:04,170
Scott: Like I'll go into a clothing store and put on Shazam and then go home and listen to that.

986
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,497
Scott: So it's funny not buy clothes.

987
01:00:05,537 --> 01:00:10,187
Rym: I said I'm listening to Simpson wave and like I'm not joking look, I literally am listening to Simpson wave.

988
01:00:10,308 --> 01:00:14,261
Rym: but That is very aesthetically similar to the kind of music.

989
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:20,086
Rym: They tend to play late at night in the rock climbing gym I go to and I'm digging that aesthetic a lot.

990
01:00:20,146 --> 01:00:23,697
Rym: It's this is sort of The Muzak got to you.

991
01:00:23,717 --> 01:00:26,510
Rym: Yeah, but it's a step up from Muzak because it's a little more.

992
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:41,914
Rym: It's more sparse than Muzak and yet more punctuated at the same time Mm-hmm, like sparser more punctuated melodic and rhythmic elements Basic income.

993
01:00:41,954 --> 01:00:48,107
Rym: so that's been coming up a lot and I'd love we could do a whole show on that probably basic guaranteed income.

994
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:51,170
Scott: What's there to say other than we're just waiting for it?

995
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,119
Rym: I think I could say a lot about like cool.

996
01:00:53,521 --> 01:00:54,204
Rym: Where could it succeed?

997
01:00:54,224 --> 01:00:54,888
Rym: Where could it fail?

998
01:00:54,928 --> 01:00:55,370
Rym: What would it do?

999
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,175
Rym: What would we do?

1000
01:00:56,497 --> 01:00:58,470
Rym: What's the threshold where we wouldn't work anymore?

1001
01:00:58,690 --> 01:00:59,355
Rym: Like that kind of stuff.

1002
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:10,130
Rym: if I can just live my life comfortably Comfortably you mean comfortably like our New York high-fluent lifestyle or like living in like a shack outside of Albany somewhere.

1003
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,336
Scott: No, I'm not living in a shack.

1004
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:11,899
Scott: What the fuck.

1005
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,495
Rym: a warm shack though, like you don't have to do anything Got internet.

1006
01:01:15,515 --> 01:01:17,040
Scott: Yeah, can I still buy comic books every month?

1007
01:01:17,562 --> 01:01:19,207
Rym: Oh, yeah, but you can't afford to go to Pax's.

1008
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:22,513
Scott: fuck that Why live?

1009
01:01:22,774 --> 01:01:26,529
Rym: the problem is everyone was talking about basic income because they're like all Switzerland's doing it.

1010
01:01:26,951 --> 01:01:28,056
Rym: No, Switzerland's not.

1011
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:31,290
Rym: they're voting on it and no one in Switzerland wants it to happen.

1012
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:37,404
Rym: They're almost everyone in Switzerland is like crazily Violently opposed to the idea of basic income.

1013
01:01:37,424 --> 01:01:48,622
Rym: Also, they have mad money Need the basic income like the places where this is being put forth for referendums or debate The the tide is overwhelmingly against it.

1014
01:01:48,682 --> 01:01:50,087
Rym: Like this is not moving forward.

1015
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:50,729
Scott: They don't need it.

1016
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,193
Rym: Yeah, they do.

1017
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:52,895
Rym: There's poor people there.

1018
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:54,481
Scott: Yeah, but there's not.

1019
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:56,810
Scott: it's not mostly poor people like other countries.

1020
01:01:57,151 --> 01:02:00,684
Rym: Uh ride-sharing like lyft and uber those aren't ride-sharing.

1021
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:06,710
Rym: Those are just like evil subcontractor like slave wage slave nonsense companies.

1022
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:07,493
Rym: That should be banned.

1023
01:02:08,034 --> 01:02:10,723
Rym: ride-sharing is not what either of those things actually does.

1024
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:12,810
Scott: Well, they are doing some ride-sharing.

1025
01:02:13,111 --> 01:02:18,190
Scott: Yeah, that's you can get an uber and it might pull up with someone else in it already who's going somewhere close to where?

1026
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:19,093
Rym: You're yeah, you know what?

1027
01:02:19,254 --> 01:02:23,110
Scott: No one wants that and like people do it because it's a cheaper ride.

1028
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:31,748
Rym: It's only slightly cheaper and from everyone I've heard who talks about it It is Russian roulette with what crazy motherfuckers sitting next to you in that car.

1029
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:40,557
Rym: Sure It is bad news bears and also forget that the ride the people who do drive those cars are just exploited Subcontractors.

1030
01:02:40,578 --> 01:02:41,062
Scott: Well, sure.

1031
01:02:41,082 --> 01:02:44,819
Rym: Yeah Zombies, no, we're not doing part four of zombies.

1032
01:02:45,401 --> 01:02:46,585
Rym: It's never gonna rise from the dead.

1033
01:02:46,606 --> 01:02:51,276
Rym: I Got there's nothing more I could say about zombies There.

1034
01:02:51,296 --> 01:02:52,228
Rym: their time has passed.

1035
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:56,303
Rym: All right, guess we did a show about that.

1036
01:02:56,443 --> 01:03:03,412
Scott: we've done this show before Where we go through a bunch of topics people suggest and shoot them all down and yet somehow we went longer than we do for An average show.

1037
01:03:03,553 --> 01:03:09,044
Scott: Yeah, cuz it takes a long time to do a bunch of things for five minutes instead of one thing for Do we do more than four things?

1038
01:03:09,105 --> 01:03:09,509
Scott: It's worth it.

1039
01:03:16,362 --> 01:03:18,609
