1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,227
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 23rd, 2014.

2
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:10,608
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,240
Rym: What's good?

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,887
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight!

5
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:18,339
Rym: Game show home versions!

6
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,858
Rym: Home versions of game shows.

7
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:25,419
Scott: Let's do this!

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,330
Rym: So my subway commute's been getting way crowded lately because the subway's just been kind of shitty for the last few weeks.

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,710
Scott: Well, in addition to just being slightly shittier than usual, more people are riding the subway because it's cold.

10
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,192
Rym: Yup.

11
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,880
Rym: And also, you only take one subway.

12
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:46,809
Rym: I have to take two subways or the E. Also known as the EH.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,525
Scott: Tourists.

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:48,771
Rym: Yeah, tourists.

15
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:49,533
Rym: Oh, Scott.

16
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:56,950
Rym: Well, I was about to say, I can complain about tourists because all the tourist bus stops are literally in front of my building, but you are in like tourist ground zero.

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,670
Scott: The tourist bus stops are also in front of my room.

18
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,890
Rym: I'm also in tourist ground zero because all the tourists keep coming to see ground zero.

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:17,270
Rym: But, as a result, the subway I take is so crowded that I can't easily do anything on the subway but listen to podcasts unless I don't get any coffee.

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,550
Rym: If I have no coffee in my hand, then I can hold my phone up to my face and I can play Nuroshima Hex.

21
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:27,889
Rym: That's about all I can do, but I can't play anyone that requires me to click around a whole bunch.

22
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:30,150
Rym: So, I can't play like that fucking Omega or whatever.

23
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,510
Rym: Or the dancers.

24
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:34,660
Rym: The Omega, the doomsday machine thing.

25
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,230
Rym: I don't know what any of the factions are called.

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,973
Scott: I don't know either.

27
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:40,370
Scott: Orange, blue, yellow, green, purple, light purple, gray.

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:48,750
Rym: So, I realize that people, everyone I talk to who says purple or light purple means different things, so I think a lot of our friends just don't actually know the names of colors.

29
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,310
Scott: Light purple is the armored one.

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,814
Rym: Yes.

31
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,210
Rym: Yes, you're correct.

32
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:54,689
Scott: The other purple is the garbage one.

33
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:56,680
Rym: The other purple will fuck you up.

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,530
Rym: That other purple can consistently beat blue.

35
00:01:59,212 --> 00:01:59,890
Scott: I don't know about that.

36
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:00,872
Rym: Let's play.

37
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:08,449
Rym: Anyway, I'm playing a lot of Nuroshima Hex because it's either that or podcasts and I'm all out of podcasts.

38
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,269
Rym: Dave and Joel don't update fast enough.

39
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,609
Rym: I'm not listening to us.

40
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,130
Scott: Alright, so let's just move to the news because whatever.

41
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:26,248
Scott: So, originally, my coworker, a year or two ago, was watching the awesome games done quick speed run thingy.

42
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:27,605
Scott: Oh yeah.

43
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:30,470
Scott: I was just like, what is the deal with that?

44
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,670
Scott: I didn't care, but then I watched it and then I cared.

45
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:40,670
Rym: The crazy thing about him is how it's some crazy long game and yet they're within seconds of each other by the end of the game.

46
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:47,187
Scott: So, January 4th, 5th, and 6th, and I don't know, maybe even 7th.

47
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:50,181
Scott: Does it keep going?

48
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:50,241
Scott: 8th.

49
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,880
Scott: Wow, it's like a whole week here.

50
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:52,941
Scott: 9th.

51
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,226
Rym: There's other stuff going on.

52
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:57,963
Scott: And then the finale is on the 11th.

53
00:02:59,191 --> 00:02:59,980
Scott: That's the only thing on the 11th.

54
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,350
Scott: It's going to be awesome games done quick.

55
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,230
Scott: I guess it's a whole week of gaming awesomeness.

56
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,930
Scott: The whole schedule is on gamesdonequick.com/schedule.

57
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:11,230
Scott: It's going to be in Virginia on those dates that I just mentioned.

58
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:15,690
Scott: I mean, it's not really a thing you need to go to in person unless you want to never sleep.

59
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,702
Scott: But, I noticed on the schedule, on January 5th, at 3.55 AM, Eastern Time.

60
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,436
Scott: Oh no, wait.

61
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:24,943
Scott: Wrong one.

62
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:25,349
Scott: Where'd it go?

63
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:25,974
Scott: Oh.

64
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,150
Scott: I just scrolled off my screen.

65
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,234
Rym: Professionalism.

66
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:29,449
Rym: This is why we need teleprompters.

67
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:30,205
Scott: Yep.

68
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:32,505
Scott: Oh, there it is.

69
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:32,769
Scott: Oh.

70
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,770
Scott: That's how it got confused between the name of the person and the name of the game.

71
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:39,590
Scott: My game, a jam of olden days.

72
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,830
Rym: Mega Man 2?

73
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,428
Scott: Dynamite Heady.

74
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:45,410
Scott: Someone's going to rock Dynamite Heady, I guess.

75
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,222
Scott: And looking at the schedule, 3.55 to 4.50, so it'll take them about an hour.

76
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,409
Scott: That's about right.

77
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,250
Scott: That game gets ridiculously hard when you get late in the game.

78
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:03,430
Rym: I have fond memories in RIT of sitting on the couch playing Zelda 2 and you were just playing Dynamite Heady on an emulator on your computer in the living room.

79
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,849
Scott: Dynamite Heady's good shit.

80
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:05,969
Scott: Dynamite Heady's a good game.

81
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,150
Rym: So it's just the only good game I'm saying.

82
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:09,447
Scott: No, there's a lot.

83
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,549
Scott: But yeah, there's a lot of awesome games going to be going down here.

84
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:20,809
Scott: I recommend looking at the schedule, marking down the ones you want to see and then going back later and watching them.

85
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,190
Scott: I can see a Wario 4 there early in the schedule, like the second game.

86
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:28,170
Scott: So, exciting things going down.

87
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:39,350
Rym: So, in other news, I don't know when this was changed because I don't actually play competitive Counter-Strike that much and even when I do I don't pay attention and I only started playing Counter-Strike again recently.

88
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,149
Scott: I think it was changed many months ago.

89
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:54,229
Rym: Yes, but it was changed because basically there's a flood of people on the internet one, making jokes about the Silvers and two, people who don't understand this.

90
00:04:55,012 --> 00:05:05,023
Rym: Like this guy posted in the Counter-Strike forums he's like, "I'm stuck at Silver 1 and I feel like I'm stuck here for a long time but I've won 39 games and I have a really good kill/death ratio so I'm confused why I'm at this

91
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:05,266
Rym: level.".

92
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:11,684
Rym: The first response is a better player who says and I quote, "You are stuck at Silver 1 because you are a Silver 1

93
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:12,027
Rym: player.".

94
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:24,709
Rym: Basically, the only people who know about what I'm going to bring up right now are people who have read Richard Garfield's characteristics of games, play chess competitively or play racquetball competitively.

95
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:30,130
Scott: Or there's a few others, but people who are like super serious into old man competitive type games.

96
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,090
Rym: Yes, or people who study the certain kinds of maths in school to where they would learn about this.

97
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,070
Scott: There's not a large percentage of people on the earth who know about this topic.

98
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:44,350
Rym: So ELO ratings, named after Electric Light Orchestra apparently according to Google rankings.

99
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,149
Scott: No, it's a guy whose name was ELO.

100
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:47,148
Rym: Yes, and you know what?

101
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:50,189
Rym: Electric Light Orchestra has a higher rating on Google search.

102
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,130
Scott: They're more important than he was, despite his importance.

103
00:05:53,450 --> 00:06:01,268
Rym: Basically, I'm not going to explain how the system works because I only understand it on a superficial level because that's all you need to understand it on unless you're designing a system that uses it.

104
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,809
Rym: The idea is that, you know, people complain about matchmaking systems in games.

105
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,010
Rym: And most games fuck up their matchmaking systems in a bad way.

106
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,910
Rym: Like that's Heroes of New Earth was real bad partly because of the lack of effective matchmaking among all the other problems.

107
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:20,789
Scott: Also, even if you have the best matchmaking code in the universe, you need a very large player base.

108
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,410
Scott: You need a large number of simultaneous people online to be able to make matches.

109
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,309
Scott: The only people online at this current moment are a noob and the all-time god.

110
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:29,928
Scott: Guess what?

111
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:41,409
Rym: Yeah, but basically it's a system to rank players that is objective and quantifiable based on their performance against each other as individuals or as teams.

112
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:50,770
Rym: And then with that ranking, you can predict the outcome of a game and whenever the predictions are off the system basically self-corrects.

113
00:06:50,790 --> 00:07:00,989
Rym: So if you're predicted to win 76% of the time and you win way more often than that, it starts correcting your rank upward until you win the predicted amount of time.

114
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:07,449
Rym: It's a fantastic system, like every piece of knowledge and study I've ever seen about it.

115
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:27,789
Scott: If you have teams or players who are playing each other not like on a schedule or in a tournament, right, but in just sort of people are playing each other all the time and people who do play each other might be of various skill levels and there's many, many competitors and you want to be able to rank them without having some sort of structured tournament or anything like that, this is what you use.

116
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:34,050
Rym: So it turns out Counter-Strike is using this to provide the player rankings in competitive play.

117
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:45,950
Scott: Well, on the one hand, that's an excellent thing to do because there's lots and lots of games of Counter-Strike happening all the time between people of various skill levels and of no sort of tournament structure and you want to be able to rank people from top to bottom.

118
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:47,670
Scott: that would be the great thing to use.

119
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,249
Scott: But as a monkey wrench, because people are on teams which greatly affects outcomes.

120
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:52,970
Scott: Exactly.

121
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,809
Scott: As opposed to where ELO is usually used for things where it's just an individual like chess.

122
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:08,209
Rym: So what I have linked here too is one, I'm going to link you guys to the Wikipedia article because if you care about games enough to listen to this fucking podcast as opposed to other gaming podcasts, you should at least understand the basics of what this system is.

123
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,849
Scott: You'll probably end up knowing more about it than we do.

124
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,949
Rym: If you read that Wikipedia page from top to bottom, you will know more than we know.

125
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:25,750
Rym: I'm also going to link to a somewhat poorly written, but apparently from skimming it, it looks accurate, explanation of how it works in Counter-Strike.

126
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,810
Scott: How they account for you being on a team.

127
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:32,730
Scott: Like if I'm on a team with a bunch of pros and we rise to the top, what happens to their rank, what happens to my rank?

128
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:43,770
Rym: And it seems to use something along the lines of the total number of ELO points of the team and then it does some shenanigans and it seems to work pretty well.

129
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:48,570
Rym: I don't see too many obvious flaws with the way this is described and the way it's working.

130
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,109
Rym: So this is an awesome thing and this is why Valve consistently hits it out of the park and a lot of other people don't.

131
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:05,330
Rym: Someone probably had their pet project of "fix this system" and happened to know some game theory and happened to know some real games and math stuff.

132
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,550
Rym: And yeah, this is just super cool.

133
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:18,910
Rym: And I feel like I should start playing Counter-Strike again competitively because I noticed recently that the few times I did play competitively, everyone really sucked and when I played casually, everyone was way better.

134
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,810
Rym: And I think it's because my rank is way low because I haven't been playing competitively.

135
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,028
Rym: So I should go correct that.

136
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:36,010
Rym: Not that I'm any good, but... So things of the day!

137
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,649
Rym: Related to my news, this is a video.

138
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,668
Rym: It is titled "The Beauty of the Silver Ranks".

139
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:49,930
Rym: This is from a silver ranked competitive Counter-Strike game and it is the best way to describe it.

140
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,548
Scott: I saw this video.

141
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,209
Rym: The best way to describe it.

142
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:52,748
Rym: Just watch it.

143
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,510
Rym: Even if you know nothing about Counter-Strike, it is obvious what happened and I dare you to not laugh out loud.

144
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:03,990
Rym: And the other great thing about it is it reminds me of Little League Baseball trick plays.

145
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:16,030
Scott: Yeah, in Little League Baseball, a common thing that will happen is when someone gets a walk, they will run to first base and then as soon as they get there, just keep running and go all the way to second, which is perfectly legal, even in Major League Baseball.

146
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,690
Rym: Yeah, but in Major League Baseball, you can do that.

147
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,350
Scott: In Major League Baseball, if you did that, you would be out.

148
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:22,658
Rym: Unless you could run... Theoretically, there's a speed.

149
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,170
Rym: you could run where you would not be out.

150
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:25,630
Scott: You wouldn't be out automatically.

151
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,369
Scott: You would be out because the other team isn't defensively inept and they would get you out.

152
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,290
Rym: But I'm saying you could theoretically, maybe with cybernetics, have a human who was fast enough.

153
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:35,009
Scott: But against a Little League team, right?

154
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:42,430
Scott: When the pitcher has to now throw the ball to first or second base to try to get you out, the chances of him just throwing it way out into the outfield...

155
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,031
Rym: Yeah, are like 98%.

156
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:49,070
Scott: Or not throwing it there fast enough or not noticing or whatever is very high.

157
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,030
Scott: And thus, that sort of shit works.

158
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:52,877
Scott: So this is the silver ranks.

159
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:55,170
Scott: This is basically Counter-Strike Little League.

160
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,290
Scott: So shit like this works.

161
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,630
Rym: This shit is hilarious.

162
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:01,969
Scott: Alright, so, thing of the day.

163
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:09,310
Scott: Seeing as it is holiday season, many nerdy people are giving away holiday gifts and cheer.

164
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:15,550
Scott: Especially in the not enough mentioned on this podcast, Tabletop RPG Arena.

165
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:21,070
Scott: So, ending the day you listen to this podcast, maybe?

166
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:26,370
Scott: It might be too late to cash in on this one by the time you hear this.

167
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:33,110
Scott: But, good friend, Epidiah Ravichal, I don't know how to pronounce his last name properly.

168
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:34,510
Scott: Whatever.

169
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:39,050
Scott: He is offering a deal known as Epimoss.

170
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:46,950
Scott: And in Epimoss, you can get over 30 games, including some Epimoss debuts and exclusives.

171
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,170
Scott: And they're in the form of many, many bundles.

172
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,101
Scott: Each of which bundle is $10, right?

173
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,970
Scott: Each $10 bundle has between $20 and $30 worth of PDFs of Tabletop RPG goodness.

174
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:07,730
Scott: But, if you buy multiple bundles, the discounts, they increase.

175
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:11,270
Scott: And I think there are nine bundles total, maybe?

176
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:14,711
Scott: And if you buy all of them, it's $45.

177
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:20,571
Scott: But each one is already like $30 worth of stuff for $10.

178
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:30,492
Scott: So, it's just like this ridiculous deal where you get enough Tabletop RPG PDFs to occupy you for the rest of your life for about $40.

179
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:33,910
Scott: And if you missed out on it, I'm sure maybe he'll let you have it still.

180
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,450
Rym: Well, I mean, we tweeted about it yesterday.

181
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:40,110
Scott: Maybe you should follow us on Twitter.

182
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,229
Scott: Other news on Tabletop RPGness.

183
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,949
Scott: For absolutely zero dollars, it is now Torchbearer Moss as well.

184
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:50,950
Rym: Oh, Torchbearer.

185
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:56,670
Scott: And for this day, well, the day before you listen to this, this today.

186
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,010
Rym: They might have figured out when we recorded this episode.

187
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,388
Scott: And a couple days after that.

188
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:08,570
Scott: Four days of gifts, free gifts, to show their appreciation for those of you who play Torchbearer.

189
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,950
Rym: Can I just have some armor that's not heavy?

190
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,689
Rym: They will release stuff for me.

191
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:20,050
Scott: They will release beta versions of two Torchbearer character classes that provide you with level benefits through level 10.

192
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,890
Scott: So far, they have the Dwarf Adventure and the Human Cleric.

193
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:24,100
Scott: Yeah, Cleric.

194
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:25,069
Rym: I'm all about the Cleric.

195
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:36,090
Scott: Who at level 10 can, among other things, replace one of his natures, anyone he chooses, with either praying, fighting, or converting.

196
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,830
Scott: Which are ridiculously powerful natures that apply to almost any situation.

197
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:41,614
Scott: So, yeah.

198
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:46,592
Scott: Good luck getting to level 10.

199
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:50,270
Scott: If you aren't already playing Torchbearer, you should play some Torchbearer.

200
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,049
Rym: Yes, you should.

201
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,929
Scott: Which isn't free, but these class beta thingies are free, so you should check them out.

202
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:04,767
Scott: It's tabletop RPG season, you're gonna be sitting at home, not at work, you got time, you're with people, tabletop RPG season.

203
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:08,830
Rym: We should play some Torchbearer over the New Year's weekend, I think.

204
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,628
Scott: That is doable.

205
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,672
Rym: Well, you know, we'll do.

206
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:17,350
Rym: We'll go into the kitchen room around the corner with just people who already know how to play, just sit down and fucking play.

207
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,509
Scott: That is doable.

208
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,849
Rym: That's happenable.

209
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:21,310
Scott: Bring a dice.

210
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,430
Rym: In a moment, the booklet book is Watership Down, it's about awesome rabbits on an adventure, and it's a great book and you should read it.

211
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:28,490
Scott: Adventure time.

212
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:36,250
Rym: Also, you can stop fucking bothering me about it, we uploaded a new Utena episode, episode 13.

213
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,210
Rym: I think it's our longest episode of GeekNights Presents Utena to date.

214
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,170
Scott: It's longer than the Utena episode.

215
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,029
Rym: And they're only gonna get longer as the season goes on.

216
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,850
Scott: The next one's probably gonna be mad long.

217
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:55,870
Rym: Oh my god, yeah, so, Utena's a great anime and you should watch the anime and then watch our thing because we literally spoil everything per episode.

218
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,009
Scott: It's meant for people who've already seen it.

219
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:05,830
Rym: Yes, if you haven't already seen an episode of Utena and you watch our thing, not only will we spoil everything, but you won't even understand what the fuck we're talking about.

220
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:07,147
Scott: No, you definitely won't.

221
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:07,568
Rym: Yeah.

222
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:16,630
Scott: This is the last episode before Holiday Times in the United States of Oomerica, so there probably won't be any more.

223
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:18,430
Rym: Oomerica, no one's gonna get that reference.

224
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,789
Scott: There probably won't be any new episodes of GeekNights.

225
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:29,730
Rym: If anyone understands Oomerica as a reference, I will, I might just buy you a copy of the thing that that's referencing.

226
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:32,350
Rym: 'Cause seriously.

227
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,369
Rym: If it's even in print.

228
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:39,731
Scott: The next episode of GeekNights might be in 2015?

229
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,266
Rym: Might be.

230
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:41,187
Scott: I don't know.

231
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,723
Rym: But some more videos gonna come out in the meantime.

232
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:44,547
Rym: I have a queue of video.

233
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:44,970
Rym: I gotta get up.

234
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,082
Scott: There might be some more GeekNights in 2014, but I don't know.

235
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,690
Rym: And also, very important, ConnectiCon, the convention that we actually run the panels department for.

236
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,259
Rym: Like, it's an awesome convention.

237
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,966
Rym: It is the Dragon Con of the East.

238
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:00,010
Rym: Like, I'm not even joking.

239
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,928
Scott: Dragon Con is in the East.

240
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:02,710
Rym: It's in the Southeast.

241
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:04,090
Scott: That's still East.

242
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,869
Rym: That's the South, not the East.

243
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:07,529
Scott: I guess it's not in the Far East.

244
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:11,290
Rym: It's in Connecticut, if you couldn't guess.

245
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:11,845
Scott: Yes.

246
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,953
Rym: It's an awesome con.

247
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:18,330
Rym: It's one of the very, very, very few conventions we would go to, even if we weren't staffer guests.

248
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:25,490
Rym: Like, I wouldn't fly across the country to go to ConnectiCon, but I would drive five to seven hours to go to ConnectiCon.

249
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:26,070
Rym: Oh yeah.

250
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:26,827
Rym: Like, easily.

251
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,090
Scott: If you're a nerd within driving distance of Hartford, Connecticut, that's where you should be on that weekend.

252
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,590
Scott: Unless you're on a beach far away on vacation because of the summer.

253
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,990
Scott: That's the only real excuse.

254
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,050
Rym: Or if a PAX was scheduled that same weekend.

255
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:43,690
Scott: No, San Diego Comic Con is usually the same weekend, but you should go to ConnectiCon instead.

256
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:44,307
Rym: Yes.

257
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,150
Scott: Because San Diego Comic Con doesn't really have the gaming that ConnectiCon has.

258
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,290
Rym: But I bring it up because panel submissions for next year, July, are open.

259
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:54,830
Rym: And we're scheduling panels on a rolling basis.

260
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:02,830
Rym: Meaning, I'm just going to schedule stuff as I feel like it, and as soon as I decide a panel's out of time, it appears in the schedule.

261
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:04,910
Scott: It might get moved before ConnectiCon.

262
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,569
Scott: Yup, and you know what, you can deal with that.

263
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,690
Scott: It might even get cancelled if the person, like, we find out that they're a horrible person, or who knows what.

264
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:11,008
Scott: Yup.

265
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:19,230
Scott: There are many things that can happen, but we will put together the schedule in sort of real time, and you will be able to see it evolve over real time.

266
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:25,030
Rym: Now, what's cool is that most nerd conventions don't do this, and the reasons they give are reasons that I used to give.

267
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:31,850
Rym: One, people whose panels suck wonder why they didn't get accepted for a long time, but yet all these other panels got accepted because of drama.

268
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:32,669
Scott: That's just tough shit.

269
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:37,570
Rym: Two, they don't actually make the schedule until, like, a couple weeks before the con.

270
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,369
Rym: Ahem, most times we go to.

271
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:44,630
Rym: Three, they don't have the technology to make that happen.

272
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:45,928
Scott: Ahem, hem, hem.

273
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:56,170
Rym: Uh, so, this is kind of an unprecedented thing for a, like, moderately too large sized fan convention to let you see live the panel, like, acceptance scheduling process.

274
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:08,350
Scott: There is exactly one- But, it's really good that we're doing this, because the benefit, the key benefit, is that people who are making the decision to go to ConnectiCon well in advance, as they should, have much more information with which to make that decision.

275
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,071
Scott: They can say, "Aha!

276
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:18,029
Scott: That thing that I want to see is going to be at ConnectiCon, very likely, I mean, it's not guaranteed, but very likely, it's on the schedule, that makes me want to go to

277
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:18,129
Scott: it.".

278
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:20,850
Scott: Whereas if it's just empty schedule, you're going to a convention.

279
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:32,289
Rym: Yup, and right now, there is exactly one panel in the schedule, so, they're batting a thousand, losing games is in panel three at 2pm, it's run by Rym.

280
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,610
Scott: Subject to change.

281
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,630
Rym: Yup, I put it there mostly so I could test that all the emails and everything went out and everything looked good.

282
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,085
Scott: Cancel that now.

283
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,100
Rym: Nah, it's a good panel, I'm sticking it in.

284
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:42,650
Scott: I think it's a good panel.

285
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,570
Scott: You sure that time's going to work?

286
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,870
Rym: Uh, probably, I mean, I'm the one who decides if the times work or not, it's not like- What if a guest just has to be in panel three?

287
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:58,289
Rym: If nine guests all need panels at two o'clock on Saturday- That's a good time.

288
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,009
Rym: It is a good time, it's a really good time, because I heard that guy's pretty good.

289
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:09,170
Rym: Yeah, so I'm going to be scheduling stuff, and as will the other people who schedule panels, it's not just me and Scott, there's other people on our staff.

290
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:21,650
Rym: But yeah, ConnectiCon, schedule some bigger panels sooner rather than later, because if you send an awesome panel in, like a few months before the con, probably already scheduled most of the schedule by that point.

291
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,990
Rym: The odds of me dislodging something for you drop the longer you wait.

292
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:33,154
Rym: Alright, so- Let's do it the other way around.

293
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:39,130
Rym: But a long time ago, in the heady year of 1993 in October- You're starting way later than I started.

294
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,269
Rym: Super Nintendo.

295
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,709
Scott: I got some for regular Nintendo.

296
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:45,609
Rym: Oh, those exist, but this is the one I know the most about.

297
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,080
Rym: A game called Family Feud was released on the cartridge.

298
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,750
Rym: You can buy it right now for 88 cents on Amazon, it looks like.

299
00:19:53,153 --> 00:19:54,110
Scott: Or just download the ROM.

300
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,688
Rym: Or you can go, "Wow, there is an unopened copy for sale for

301
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:00,074
Rym: $30.".

302
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,070
Scott: What would you do with that?

303
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,097
Rym: Who has that?

304
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:02,722
Rym: Why?

305
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,346
Scott: Anyway- What would you do with that?

306
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,277
Rym: So, we got this idea that we definitely talked about, like we've talked about game shows.

307
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:10,840
Rym: We've talked about party games.

308
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:17,370
Rym: We haven't actually talked about game shows adapted to the home version.

309
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,617
Scott: Right, so game shows are a very interesting thing.

310
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,320
Scott: There's a whole nerdery about game shows.

311
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,483
Scott: A lot of people are into them.

312
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:25,167
Scott: I enjoy them from time to time.

313
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,510
Scott: There's a long history of them.

314
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,190
Scott: There's a whole lot going on there in the game show department.

315
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,989
Rym: Yeah, I'll link to the episode where we talked about that.

316
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,898
Scott: And even though game shows have waxed and waned over the years, Jeopardy!

317
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:35,620
Scott: is still on.

318
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,450
Scott: Wheel of Fortune is still on every night in this sort of relatively prime time slot.

319
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,030
Scott: Meanwhile, Monopoly- Family watches TV during dinner.

320
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,528
Rym: Monopoly the game show didn't make it.

321
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:54,783
Scott: M-O-N-O-P-O-L-Y There's a lot of "reality" shows, which are actually just game shows in disguise.

322
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,148
Scott: You know, millionaires, popular.

323
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:58,130
Scott: These are big things.

324
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:07,090
Scott: So, especially in the 80s and 90s, even now, but more so then, having home editions of game shows was sort of a big deal, right?

325
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:11,479
Scott: And, you know, it was not just video games, but also physical games.

326
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:13,423
Scott: There was a home double dare.

327
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:14,265
Scott: I shit you not.

328
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:16,510
Scott: I knew a kid who had home double dare.

329
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:18,564
Scott: You can go and find it if you Google it.

330
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:19,470
Scott: It existed.

331
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:31,750
Rym: I mean, I had a home Wheel of Fortune from, like, an era where this game had a really, really complicated physical mechanism for making the Wheel of Fortune board work.

332
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,134
Scott: My cousins had a home Jeopardy!

333
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:34,238
Scott: that actually had a big Jeopardy!

334
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:34,438
Scott: board.

335
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:38,010
Scott: You'd slide cards into it and flip open the little windows to see the thing.

336
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,434
Rym: You'd slide a big card into the Wheel of Fortune thing.

337
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:51,190
Rym: It also had the spinner and all those other pieces, but then every slot where there could be a letter would have an open hole, and there'd be an underline there showing you there is a letter here for this puzzle.

338
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,641
Rym: And it had this really hard to move, heavy door.

339
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,090
Rym: you'd slide and click up to reveal things.

340
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:03,430
Scott: Yeah, I mean, because a game show is just fundamentally a show, a television show, where people are playing a game.

341
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:04,050
Scott: Exactly.

342
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,994
Scott: And you want to see who wins, right?

343
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:12,970
Scott: There's a lot more closer relationship with, like, esports, you know, than there is, you know, with physical sports.

344
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,948
Rym: You know, they're T-sports.

345
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,595
Scott: What's the difference between, you know, Jeopardy!

346
00:22:16,695 --> 00:22:18,218
Scott: and Counter-Strike on TV?

347
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:23,790
Scott: Well, one is, you know, based on clicking and one is based on knowledge.

348
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,739
Rym: Well, what's the difference between Jeopardy!

349
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,286
Rym: and, say, football?

350
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:31,350
Scott: One is based on punching and one is based on knowledge.

351
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,388
Rym: Oh my god, they're all games.

352
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:32,881
Rym: Yeah.

353
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:33,388
Rym: Games.

354
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,328
Scott: It's a game show.

355
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:45,590
Rym: But game shows very specifically have a heavy overlap with either professional sports in the sense that they're made not for the people playing, but for the people watching.

356
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,170
Rym: Game shows are often not actually fun to be on, they're fun to watch other people be on.

357
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,383
Scott: Well, the other thing, well, yeah, they're designed for the spectator first, right?

358
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:57,410
Scott: And then for the participant second.

359
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,230
Scott: I mean, case in point.

360
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,490
Scott: The participant, most of the excitement for the participant comes from the prize winning.

361
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:02,173
Scott: Exactly.

362
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,710
Rym: No one is playing most game shows unless there's cash money.

363
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:15,550
Scott: Right, and the reason for the prize winning is because it's not, like, the difference between this and, say, sports is there isn't, like, a consistent, like, players and teams to root for.

364
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,815
Scott: I mean, someone might keep winning on Jeopardy!

365
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:23,870
Scott: and gain a following, but usually when you're on a game show, you're on there for a limited time and then you're done.

366
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,310
Scott: So, it's like you're just an individual human being who's just some contestant and that's it.

367
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:31,575
Scott: So, the prizes are the reward.

368
00:23:31,615 --> 00:23:37,890
Scott: There isn't, like, a grand championship to win or, you know, some trophy or, you know, tournament at the end of every year.

369
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,650
Rym: You're not the league master at Wheel of Fortune.

370
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,970
Scott: Yeah, there's no playoffs at Wheel of Fortune at the end of the year where you can win the wheelie or whatever.

371
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,367
Rym: Well, they do do stuff like that, actually.

372
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,270
Rym: Like, they do have, like, the Masters Series or whatever in a lot of these game shows.

373
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,850
Scott: Yeah, no, but there isn't, like, the Super Bowl every single year at the same time, you know, things like that.

374
00:23:52,990 --> 00:24:21,210
Rym: This is thus why game shows adapted as home additions are an interesting game design challenge because you have a game that, one, is designed primarily for spectation, designed to last a predictable amount of time no matter what, designed to be able to have a lot of stuff happen off-screen to fix issues that you don't show to the spectators, and the players have no capacity to master the game or to find degenerate strategies in the game.

375
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:23,069
Rym: Usually, they film a whole season of a game show.

376
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,729
Rym: Like, you know, kids would watch Legend of the Hidden Temple and think, "Oh, I could fucking do

377
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:27,950
Rym: that.".

378
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:42,510
Scott: It's like, no, they had literally, like, ten shows' worth of kids in there at once, and it would be like, the water part, it's like, they would do the water part, like, ten times, then they would do the basketball thing, like, five times, then they do the other thing, and then they did the temple, like, ten times in a row.

379
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,775
Rym: So imagine watching a Counter-Strike tournament.

380
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:51,990
Rym: where Counter-Strike existed, people who had never seen it before played it live once, and then could never play it again.

381
00:24:53,070 --> 00:25:05,068
Rym: So designing games around game shows is a really interesting challenge, like I said, and unlike most of our shows about these kinds of general topics, can't really make a wide pronouncement about whether or not they're good or bad.

382
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,690
Rym: Like, it's a really mixed bag.

383
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,454
Scott: Some of them are great and some of them are awful.

384
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:15,730
Scott: Even with the same exact game show, right, there's a huge variance in quality of the product, whether it's video or tabletop.

385
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,210
Scott: Yup.

386
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:30,750
Rym: So I had this old PC version of Concentration way back, and it was, like, floppy disks, and you'd load it, and it was, like, all these, like, CGA graphics, it was this really, really terrible old piece of shit.

387
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:38,310
Rym: But for whatever reason, me and my brother had a ton of fun playing it, because it would save the floppy to remember how much prize money you had won.

388
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:47,270
Rym: So we had a long-running tournament, even though it got to the point where we actually had memorized everything that was in the game, which is a common problem with pretty much all these things.

389
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,198
Scott: I think one thing is that some shows definitely do translate better than others, right?

390
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,782
Scott: So, like, my favorite game show is The Price is Right.

391
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,473
Scott: The price is right, guys, has to be garbage.

392
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:03,495
Scott: It just has to be.

393
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:10,810
Scott: All the fun of watching The Price is Right is you're yelling out the prices and shit, and you're telling the people what they're supposed to do.

394
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,168
Rym: The person flipping out, the crowd going crazy.

395
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:19,742
Scott: And the fact that it's, you know, you're guessing prices of things, which changes with real world, right?

396
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:24,190
Scott: So if I'm playing a Price is Right take-home edition, that's pretty much only good the year it came out.

397
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:24,618
Rym: Unless?

398
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,411
Scott: You're guessing what was the price of shampoo in 1983.

399
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:34,282
Rym: So what's funny is I have a better sense of what prices were in the early '90s than I do of what things cost today.

400
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:37,890
Rym: If you're asking me how much shampoo costs, I'm not really sure.

401
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,549
Rym: Two, now it's like six, fifty, seven?

402
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,167
Scott: Depends on how good the shampoo is.

403
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,424
Rym: For like, for Sam, I don't know, like seven, eight bucks?

404
00:26:44,524 --> 00:26:45,350
Rym: I have no idea.

405
00:26:45,452 --> 00:26:45,808
Scott: I don't know.

406
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,481
Rym: But I can tell you that if a bottle of shampoo was on The Price is Right.

407
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:52,696
Rym: when I was a kid, I would bid $3.95.

408
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:52,787
Scott: Sure.

409
00:26:53,951 --> 00:27:01,410
Rym: But at the same time, like, a game that Scott and I play way more often than you'd think is Family Feud on the Super Nintendo.

410
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,169
Scott: So Family Feud also has the timeliness problem, at least with some of the categories, right?

411
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:30,190
Rym: But at the same time, that makes it almost more interesting because if you play Family Feud on the Super Nintendo, you're trying to figure out what a hundred sanitized answers were to a question where you have a very limited amount of memory on a cartridge and limited ability to... For example, if there's a lot of ways to say an answer, they had to hard code a big list of strings that they could match on.

412
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:53,367
Scott: So that's something that happens in both the Jeopardy for both, like, all video Jeopardies and all video Family Feuds have this same exact issue where you're typing in answers in text and if the computer system that's running the game is not sufficiently advanced, it's not very good at sort.

413
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:53,467
Scott: of.

414
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:58,010
Scott: subjectively, you know, examining your answers the way humans could do.

415
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:03,928
Scott: Like, if you're playing Family Feud for real, they have judges there who run the show who are like, "Yeah, that counts as number three.

416
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:04,369
Scott: Ding.".

417
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,452
Scott: So here's an example.

418
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:10,882
Rym: What if a question was like, I don't know, something you give to someone to signify your love for them?

419
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:14,930
Rym: Should I type in "wedding ring" or just "ring"?

420
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:21,450
Scott: Yeah, and if that was a modern day computer with some Google-level technology, or even less than that, it can figure it out.

421
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:22,330
Rym: Yeah, and on a game show...

422
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,449
Scott: But if you're doing this on an NES, good luck.

423
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:39,590
Rym: Which, again, makes it fun because Scott and I will both know the answer and are trying to furiously type them in by moving a cursor around with a Super Nintendo controller, guessing at what some schmuck developing this thing in 1993.

424
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,068
Scott: What list of strings they typed in.

425
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:42,130
Rym: In 1993.

426
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,364
Scott: And if you get a spelling error, you're wrong.

427
00:28:44,746 --> 00:28:45,309
Scott: Try again.

428
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:48,570
Scott: So if you don't know how to spell the word, good luck.

429
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:55,700
Rym: But at the same time, that Family Feud game is stupid fun as a result, even though it's kind of random.

430
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,009
Rym: It's kind of the same fun as that horse racing game that we always talk about as an example of a bullshit random game.

431
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:01,770
Rym: that's still really fun.

432
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:13,030
Scott: Wheel of Fortune actually happens to be an excellent take-home video game, especially the video game, because there is no ambiguity whatsoever.

433
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,654
Scott: You spin a wheel, which a video game is really great at.

434
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:18,418
Scott: It figures out how much money stuff is.

435
00:29:18,718 --> 00:29:20,741
Scott: You choose the one letter at a time.

436
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:27,090
Scott: You don't have to type in a whole bunch of stuff until you solve the puzzle, in which case you're literally putting letters in the slots.

437
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,469
Scott: You're either right or you're wrong.

438
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:33,503
Scott: There's no subjectiveness to it.

439
00:29:33,543 --> 00:29:35,130
Scott: It's very easy for a computer to do.

440
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:41,870
Scott: So a lot of the take-home Wheel of Fortune's, especially the video game versions, are really good and just as fun as the real thing.

441
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:44,110
Scott: Only some of the phrases might be outdated.

442
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:44,453
Rym: Yep.

443
00:29:44,554 --> 00:29:45,509
Rym: Now the board game.

444
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,356
Scott: There's only so many phrases like hard coded into these games.

445
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:57,470
Scott: So once you know all the phrases like the same thing with the Family Feud, it's all hard coded in like there's a database of, you know, polls in there.

446
00:29:57,871 --> 00:30:00,719
Scott: So if you've memorized all of them, same thing.

447
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,424
Scott: I had junior jeopardy for the NES.

448
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:04,109
Scott: That really did not have a lot of questions.

449
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:10,223
Scott: So once you memorize the answers to all of them, you could pretty well dominate.

450
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:13,150
Scott: The thing was it didn't give you the answers necessarily.

451
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:16,523
Scott: I guess I'm not sure it did or didn't actually.

452
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,830
Scott: It's been so long since I played it.

453
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,772
Rym: I don't even remember.

454
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:25,670
Rym: But yeah, so like the, at least the SNES Family Feud has enough stuff in it to where unless one of us like really works at it.

455
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,750
Scott: I have yet to see a repeat on there.

456
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,490
Rym: Or takes the ROM apart and like starts looking for strings.

457
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,149
Scott: Or goes in game facts and prints them out.

458
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,921
Rym: But like the mechanical, physical wheel of fortune I had also worked great.

459
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:38,225
Rym: Like it worked perfectly.

460
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:40,210
Rym: It was 100% great to play as a game.

461
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:49,590
Rym: Except there's only a limited number of those giant pieces of cardboard and a certain brother could just go read them all and know all the answers.

462
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,489
Rym: Like when you play Trivial Pursuit.

463
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:52,352
Scott: Yeah.

464
00:30:52,372 --> 00:30:54,810
Scott: Good luck memorizing huge decks of Trivial Pursuit cards.

465
00:30:55,251 --> 00:31:00,444
Rym: That's actually at the one time in recent memory I was forced to play a game of Trivial Pursuit.

466
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,730
Rym: It was an addition from like decades ago.

467
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:08,450
Rym: So I knew more than fucking everybody because I'm the only person who knows politics from the 80s apparently.

468
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:09,533
Rym: So yeah.

469
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:11,310
Rym: But anyway.

470
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:22,050
Rym: So in terms of games like Double Dare, the physical component, like Double Dare is a really shitty game.

471
00:31:22,972 --> 00:31:26,330
Rym: I mean it's a dumb trivia question that only stupid kids couldn't answer.

472
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,206
Rym: You never wanted to take the physical challenge unless you were sure that the other side was really stupid.

473
00:31:31,246 --> 00:31:32,350
Rym: You get the most points that way.

474
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:40,050
Rym: And a home version of that would actually probably suck because it probably had a bunch of like a little thing to make some slime.

475
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,290
Rym: And like a little Nerf gun kind of thing.

476
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,210
Scott: I think it had the thing where you wear a basket on your head and they throw balls at you and you have to catch them.

477
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,330
Rym: So it's the same physical challenge?

478
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:49,994
Scott: Yeah.

479
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:50,964
Scott: That kind of bullshit.

480
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:51,469
Scott: You know.

481
00:31:51,831 --> 00:32:01,590
Rym: The only reason any kid ever wanted to be on Double Dare was one, because just being on TV was like the most cool thing you could do as a kid in the late 80s in the world culturally.

482
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:05,089
Rym: Two, cash prizes or like a game gear or whatever.

483
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,562
Rym: And three, because if you got to the optical course, I didn't even want to win.

484
00:32:10,602 --> 00:32:13,390
Rym: I just wanted to be on the show so I could play in a giant optical course.

485
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,936
Scott: Well they also had family Double Dare.

486
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:17,990
Scott: It's like yeah, my parents answer the trivia questions.

487
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,590
Rym: And then I'll run through the giant gumball machine.

488
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,896
Scott: And they'll also get all messy.

489
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:25,090
Scott: And then the third they had Super Sloppy Double Dare.

490
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:34,250
Scott: Which I don't remember very well obviously, but I don't remember Super Sloppy Double Dare being any super or sloppier than any other Double Dare.

491
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:36,548
Scott: I think they just called it that.

492
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:45,008
Rym: So you know, if I was going to make a Double Dare home edition, the way I would do it, actually when I think about it, the problem is the trivia part is 90% of the game.

493
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:51,425
Rym: So you'd have to change the score structure around some way, but you could do the physical challenges like this.

494
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:52,970
Rym: It's horse in the real world.

495
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,915
Rym: So you know the game of horse, basketball game?

496
00:32:55,377 --> 00:32:59,070
Rym: So I do something, you have to do the same thing I did.

497
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,670
Rym: So the physical challenge is I'm going to do something, whatever that is.

498
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,680
Scott: So a completely different game.

499
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,610
Scott: that's nothing to do with Double Dare.

500
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,195
Rym: Well it's just a physical challenge.

501
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:11,129
Rym: because how do you generate physical challenges with a board game box?

502
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:17,569
Scott: They include the list of physical challenges and the necessary equipment on a piece of paper and charge you money for it.

503
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,269
Rym: So how much equipment can you possibly fit in that box?

504
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,869
Scott: Go look it up and you'll see what's in there.

505
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,010
Rym: I think it's just really lame probably.

506
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,497
Scott: It's pretty lame, yeah.

507
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:27,367
Scott: Just look for Double Dare.

508
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:27,830
Scott: take home.

509
00:33:29,232 --> 00:33:31,990
Rym: I thought Double Dare box and it was like Double Dare box wine?

510
00:33:32,818 --> 00:33:32,986
Scott: No.

511
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:35,588
Rym: Double Dare box shot for the NES.

512
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:36,570
Scott: What?

513
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:37,805
Scott: Wow.

514
00:33:38,212 --> 00:33:40,343
Scott: Oh no that's the box of the NES.

515
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:41,590
Scott: take home video game.

516
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,454
Scott: Do you dare?

517
00:33:42,614 --> 00:33:43,559
Rym: Can you handle the pressure?

518
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,364
Rym: Do you know the answer?

519
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:45,510
Scott: Do you dare the other team?

520
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,752
Scott: I played that once.

521
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:54,610
Scott: Basically it's just trivia questions which are multiple choice and the physical challenges and obviously of course the little mini games that kind of sucked.

522
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,890
Rym: The mini games look a lot like the mini games in the Three Stooges game.

523
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,477
Scott: See that Jeopardy Junior edition?

524
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:00,462
Scott: I had that.

525
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:01,950
Scott: I had that cartridge.

526
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:03,112
Scott: Alright.

527
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:06,989
Scott: Are there any other take home games?

528
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:15,969
Scott: So actually one thing I do want to talk about is things that are video games or take home games that are like game shows but never were actually game shows.

529
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:23,127
Scott: The most prominent of which is You Don't Know Jack which is basically a game show but it was never on TV.

530
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:24,190
Scott: It was just a video game.

531
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,650
Scott: And You Don't Know Jack can actually be kind of fun in the right scenario.

532
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:49,449
Scott: If people don't know how You Don't Know Jack works it's basically you sit around a computer or TV screen or whatever and it sort of does these real time challenges where you're sort of answering questions or doing other sort of games and there's a lot of push the button first kind of stuff and things like that.

533
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,657
Scott: And it's actually when it came out.

534
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:54,469
Scott: it was incredibly clever and nowadays it seems a little bit silly.

535
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:55,288
Rym: No.

536
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,294
Scott: But it's had some resurgences over the years.

537
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:11,130
Scott: So if you've got some kind of family thing going on and your family can't exactly play Counter Strike this is not a bad choice compared to other games that might be available.

538
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,251
Rym: This is sort of the rub.

539
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:19,059
Rym: Take home games like the home edition of any game show is almost guaranteed to fail unless you're really clever.

540
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:28,350
Rym: or the game is trivially adaptable like Wheel of Fortune is because if you deviate from what happens on TV at all the family who sits down to play is going to be like what this is bullshit.

541
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,730
Scott: Right so that's part of the advantage of it is like the family already knows how to play.

542
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:36,495
Rym: So you can't change anything but at the same time if you don't change anything.

543
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:40,460
Rym: the game's not designed to be played by people who play it more than once.

544
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:50,010
Rym: nor is it designed to be played in a setting that doesn't have judges and officiants and extra content and all these outside forces and it's aimed only for spectators.

545
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:50,616
Scott: It's a good thing.

546
00:35:50,636 --> 00:35:51,529
Scott: most of them are just trivia.

547
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,390
Scott: Yes.

548
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:57,063
Scott: Because anyone can just knows how to answer trivia questions like win lose or draw.

549
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,930
Scott: at Pictionary you're basically the same goddamn thing.

550
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:16,950
Rym: Now the real thing to take away from the design of like the take home editions of these kinds of games that really in this age of Twitch these kinds of games are actually great for like Twitch kind of live streaming play because very few people play most people are just watching.

551
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,230
Scott: But they're designed for spectators.

552
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:26,830
Rym: So as a result these games are probably better for that sort of thing than like Counter Strike for the average person.

553
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:28,970
Scott: Yeah.

554
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,190
Scott: So when you're home with your family this holiday time play torchbearer.

555
00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:33,870
Rym: Yeah.

556
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,430
Scott: If you want to get a game going on and you're have you're reaching to the bottom of the barrel.

557
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:38,948
Scott: They don't even want to play Hanabi.

558
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:39,808
Scott: Yeah.

559
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:41,009
Scott: They're so lame.

560
00:36:41,812 --> 00:36:43,610
Scott: The game show game might work.

561
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,849
Scott: It might open the door.

562
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:45,968
Scott: Don't knock.

563
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:48,530
Scott: I had myself in the teeth of the microphone.

564
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,048
Scott: Wow.

565
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:51,470
Rym: And for once it wasn't me like bumping into the boom.

566
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,107
Rym: That was all you.

567
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:52,670
Rym: Yeah.

568
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:53,906
Scott: So consider them.

569
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,910
Rym: Well especially the thing is don't.

570
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:57,148
Rym: I would say this.

571
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:04,950
Rym: Skip the ones that are just trivia questions because those always fail if anyone knows shit about anything.

572
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,690
Rym: And then someone gets mad.

573
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,499
Rym: You're better off going with the ones that are straight party games or where it's like.

574
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:14,790
Rym: the answers are like Family Feud is probably the best possible game to play.

575
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:17,229
Rym: Of those kinds of games.

576
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,090
Rym: Maybe Wheel of Fortune is a good second.

577
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,369
Rym: Jeopardy probably not actually going to work with the average family.

578
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,889
Scott: The junior edition.

579
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:24,530
Rym: Yeah.

580
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:32,880
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

581
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,020
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

582
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,420
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

583
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,340
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows.

584
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,100
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

585
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,616
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

586
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

587
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:02,040
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
