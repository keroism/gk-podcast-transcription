1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,050
Rym: It's Monday, October 23rd, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:25,670
Rym: Tonight and possibly for the next several days, I'm going to have to apologize for the audio quality, as during our wonderful interview with Luke Crane, the creator of Burning Wheel at UberCon, we lost the power cable to our compressor.

3
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,630
Rym: As such, we are compressorless until we can find a replacement part.

4
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,969
Rym: Thus tonight, we talk a bit about how it's difficult to get replacement parts to many pieces of consumer electronics these days.

5
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:38,207
Rym: Let's do this!

6
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:46,008
Rym: So once again, we're back here with GeekNights, and once again, we are back from a weekend out of town.

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:53,670
Scott: Yeah, we went to UberCon, well, we didn't go for the whole weekend, we just went to UberCon all day Saturday, and it was pretty awesome.

8
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,950
Rym: Yep, except for the fact that we interviewed Luke Crane, well, not except for that, because the interview with Luke Crane, the creator of Burning Wheel, was absolutely awesome.

9
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:13,549
Scott: Yeah, I listened to the interview, actually, in the car ride home, and my interview skills going in were weak, and it took about, oh, five minutes before my interview skills were times a thousand.

10
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:21,490
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I'd make fun of you, because the first couple times I tried to interview people, it totally sucked, and I just ignored those interviews when I was editing things around.

11
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:34,590
Scott: Yeah, no, it's like I asked one stupid question, and then as soon as I asked one smart question, I couldn't stop but asking more smart questions, because he gave such nice long answers, I was able to think of another smart question before he stopped.

12
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,889
Rym: Well, if one word described Luke Crane, it would be, I wanted to say eloquent, but maybe long-winded with a hyphen.

13
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,729
Scott: But that's what I wanted, because his wind is mighty and interesting.

14
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:57,010
Rym: But no, the interview was fantastic, and we'll be covering UberCon probably next Tuesday, due to the exception here, which was that we lost the cable to the compressor, the power cable.

15
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,730
Scott: Yeah, so we have a compressor, but we can't turn it on, because we can't put electricity into its electricity hole.

16
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,410
Rym: As a result, GeekNights is now going to sound the way it did before we bought a compressor.

17
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,049
Rym: Maybe a little better, just because we've learned a lot more microphone discipline since when we started.

18
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:25,008
Rym: But just a heads up, for the next couple days, GeekNights is not going to sound as good as you're accustomed to, and I hope you appreciate the money we spent on that compressor once we get it back.

19
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:31,269
Scott: Yeah, and we'll either be getting, I guess, a newer, better compressor or a power cable in a few days.

20
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,109
Scott: Well, who knows when these people are going to get back to us.

21
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:35,990
Scott: We might just have to order a new compressor.

22
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:44,010
Rym: Yeah, or try to find an electronics store that doesn't suck as much as Radio Shack that might have the 16 volt, one amp, with the correct connector transformer that we need.

23
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:46,623
Scott: Sigh.

24
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:49,610
Scott: Yeah, but- We could try to make one at Radio Shack.

25
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:59,968
Rym: Well, I could make one now, but I don't have any faith in my soldering abilities anymore, because I haven't soldered a thing since I tried to make that DDR pad two and a half years ago.

26
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:07,667
Scott: Neither do I. Hey, maybe one of our listeners who's good with electronics could be nice enough to make for us a 16 volt, one amp, transformer.

27
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:12,410
Rym: I don't know the number and type of the power connector that goes into the compressor.

28
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:24,190
Scott: Oh, yeah, I guess we could figure it out, but yeah, if you are capable of creating a power adapter, send us an email and we will send you info and pictures and stuff.

29
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:32,678
Rym: Actually, that's definitely not going to happen, because it'd be, no matter what, it's faster to order a new thing or get the cable than anything shipped by one of our listeners would be.

30
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:39,490
Scott: Maybe we can buy a new compressor, the same one, or maybe a slightly better one, and sell this one on eBay sans power cable.

31
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:40,830
Rym: That's kind of shady.

32
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,169
Scott: We will say right up front doesn't include power cable.

33
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,168
Rym: Then no one will buy it.

34
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,190
Scott: Someone might buy it.

35
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,050
Rym: No, no one will buy it.

36
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,289
Scott: People buy shit on eBay, man.

37
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,870
Rym: Yeah, and not stuff that obviously is missing something you need, especially when they realize they can't get it easily.

38
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:54,629
Scott: You never know.

39
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:55,930
Scott: Whatever.

40
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,150
Rym: See, back in the day, Radio Shack sold all that stuff.

41
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,110
Scott: Yeah, Radio Shack used to just be stuff that was the only stuff we needed.

42
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,750
Scott: Now, they got like a little TV sec- it's sort of like a little mini Best Buy, you know?

43
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:16,298
Scott: They have like a big iPod accessory section, a toy section, a cell phone section, and, you know, the actual electronics.

44
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:23,150
Scott: besides, you know, standard cables you need for home audio, video, home theater is pretty much non-existent.

45
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,690
Scott: There's a few big Radio Shacks still around.

46
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,350
Scott: Like, there's one in my town that has a little bit more stuff, but it's not much more.

47
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:33,470
Scott: They just have a lot more floor space for more displays of crap.

48
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,650
Rym: Yeah, and I have had mostly bad encounters with Radio Shack employees in recent memory.

49
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,970
Scott: The thing is, the Radio Shack website and catalog still includes all that good stuff.

50
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,470
Scott: They just don't put it all in the stores.

51
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,110
Rym: Yeah, in fact, the other day we wanted to play the Atari, but we don't have an RF switch because that's old technology.

52
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,127
Scott: So we're using our NES RF switch, which doesn't work with an Atari 7800. that well.

53
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,810
Scott: Well, it works, it works.

54
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,890
Scott: It works, but not that well.

55
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,990
Rym: You just can't see the bullets.

56
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,757
Scott: Yeah.

57
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,670
Rym: I can see them.

58
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,510
Scott: Oh, I can't see the bullets in certain color modes because, you know.

59
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:11,070
Rym: Yeah, but as a result, you know, we went to Radio Shack, hey, we need an RF switch, and they didn't have anything even close.

60
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,730
Scott: Not even remotely anywhere in the ballpark.

61
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:24,290
Rym: But anyway, aside from all that, I think we've gotten over trying to talk within the bounds of the tiny audio range of the sound card.

62
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,468
Rym: I think we can get into the news.

63
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,209
Scott: Okay.

64
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:43,330
Rym: So, IBM, whose business model, I mean, I worked for them for a number of years, and their business models seem to be looming more and more toward patent acquisition and patent enforcement, has sued Amazon pretty much for internet commerce.

65
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:44,670
Scott: What?

66
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:48,390
Rym: IBM has a massive patent portfolio.

67
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,826
Rym: I believe it's one of the largest, if not the largest, technology patent portfolio in the world.

68
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:55,450
Scott: I would believe that easily.

69
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,050
Rym: Well, also, I mean, when I worked there, we were under a lot of pressure to get patents.

70
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:08,009
Rym: I don't know what came of it, but at least one thing I worked on at IBM was up to try to be patented because they emailed me asking me for a bunch of information on it once.

71
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:09,450
Scott: Nah, eh, lol.

72
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:17,710
Rym: But they're constantly trying to patent things, and then they just sit on these patents and use them as legal fodder in the future, either to protect themselves or to go after people.

73
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,449
Scott: Oh, you know what?

74
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:25,458
Scott: While SEO is wrong, I can, uh, that's a tiny bit saying, "Yeah, go after IBM, evil patenters of many

75
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:25,865
Scott: things.".

76
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:38,249
Rym: Yeah, so what IBM did here is they sued Amazon for basically infringing on a whole mess of patents that are all extremely vague and open and basically patent the very idea of commerce on the internet.

77
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:39,719
Scott: Lol.

78
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,969
Scott: Now, furthermore- I patent trading.

79
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,230
Scott: You can't trade anything without giving me money.

80
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:49,229
Rym: Far more sinister is that this is not a new thing.

81
00:06:49,810 --> 00:07:00,070
Rym: Apparently, many unnamed retailers and online places of business have settled or licensed with IBM quietly for a number of years.

82
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:01,469
Scott: Oh, geniuses.

83
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,128
Rym: And Amazon is the first company to stand up and say, "No, we'll see you in

84
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:05,429
Rym: court.".

85
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,149
Scott: Damn straight.

86
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:13,568
Rym: IBM's been trying to get a deal with them since, I believe, 2002, and Amazon has outright ignored them.

87
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,970
Scott: You know, while Amazon isn't a perfect company, you know, they got some shady stuff like Alexa.

88
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:20,909
Scott: I think Alexa is Amazon, isn't it?

89
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:21,889
Scott: I don't know.

90
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,990
Rym: I remember Alexa was awesome, and then we found out that they were shady.

91
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,449
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure Alexa is Amazon, and, you know, they're not perfect, but they're not bad.

92
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,568
Scott: Alexa, you know, Amazon's pretty cool, and they do good stuff, and they're right in this case.

93
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,650
Rym: Well, I guess, I mean, I liked working at IBM for a number of reasons.

94
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,919
Rym: I disliked working at it for a number of other reasons,

95
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:41,441
Scott: but

96
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:51,469
Rym: I often disagreed ideologically with a lot of the things IBM did, and here is an example, one I can actually talk about because this is public knowledge, and it has nothing to do with what I did there.

97
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,990
Scott: Yeah, Alexa's an Amazon company, like I thought.

98
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:54,510
Rym: All right.

99
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,139
Rym: Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,750
Scott: All right, so I said last, there's been a whole bunch of tech news.

101
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:05,231
Scott: I was gonna use a different one, but I said I would talk about Flash 9 today, so I'm gonna talk about Flash 9.

102
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:15,888
Scott: If you didn't know, there are different versions of Macromedia, Adobe Flash Player, and you need Flash Player to do anything productive on the web, because too many websites use Flash now.

103
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,709
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, YouTube- And a lot of websites probably shouldn't use Flash, but they do.

104
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,670
Rym: But a lot of websites use it and should.

105
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,045
Rym: I mean, YouTube, Google Video-.

106
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,310
Scott: Yes, Flash Video in particular has become very popular.

107
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,789
Rym: Yes, especially because as more and more codecs for video are on the market, hey, we're talking about codecs today.

108
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,019
Rym: Yeah.

109
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:44,670
Rym: A lot of people are having more and more trouble being able to play videos on the internet, because you have to keep up with it and always have the newest codecs for whatever fancy new thing the fan subbers are using over there in Japan.

110
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:53,950
Scott: Yeah, and Flash Video, it allows you to watch a video in a website, download it pretty quickly, even though it's very low quality, and watch it.

111
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:58,590
Scott: It's been better, it's better than watching videos in a webpage has ever been.

112
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:06,160
Rym: Yeah, you see, the purpose of Flash was that you can do all of these animation and things in this pla- no, they want-.

113
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:10,890
Rym: technically it was platform independent, but what they meant by that was it's computer independent.

114
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,510
Rym: It'll work on any computer if you have the plugin, but they only made the plugin for Windows.

115
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:24,141
Scott: Yeah, well, they also, you know, and more recently they've made more and more versions of the Flash Player, upgrading it, adding more features.

116
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:33,248
Scott: as the years have gone on, and I think Flash Player 7 was available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and, you know, that was how it was.

117
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,650
Scott: Then they came out with Flash 8.

118
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,070
Scott: Now in Flash 8, they did a lot of new stuff.

119
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:58,050
Scott: Some people who made websites, like YouTube, who were using Flash, were smart, and when they made their Flash, they made sure that their Flash was compatible with old versions of, you know, the Flash plugin, so if someone had Flash 7 instead of Flash 8, and they went to YouTube, it would still work, and they wouldn't get all these, you know, "You must

120
00:09:58,194 --> 00:09:58,589
Scott: upgrade!".

121
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:06,530
Scott: But there were a whole lot of websites, particularly websites with Flash games, that would not work with Flash, you know, 7.

122
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,069
Scott: You needed Flash 8 for them to work, it would not work.

123
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:12,190
Scott: You couldn't play a game with Flash on Linux.

124
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:13,509
Scott: You needed Windows.

125
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,870
Rym: And even aside from that, the Flash 7 for Linux sucked the balls of a llama.

126
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,730
Scott: Yes, it was terrible.

127
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:28,969
Scott: Unless you were using OSS, the old audio, you know, the way audio worked in Linux, I don't want to explain it now.

128
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,910
Rym: Open source sound.

129
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,170
Rym: Yes,

130
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:44,770
Scott: if you were using the old and busted method of sound in Linux, then it would work, but if you're using the new, correct, better way of sound in Linux, Flash wouldn't have your sound work properly, you had to do some special stuff to get it to play the audio.

131
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,010
Rym: Yeah, but even with the old way, I mean, it didn't behave correctly even for that.

132
00:10:48,211 --> 00:11:07,910
Scott: Yeah, you had a hard time getting video and audio to synchronize, and there were other versions, there's an open source Flash, you know, some guys tried to recreate Flash, you know, just separately from Macromedia Adobe, and they did an okay job, but it's not even close to Flash 7, and Flash 7 for Linux is terrible.

133
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:17,230
Scott: So they hired one dude, well, it's one dude, but he has a lot of help, and he works at Adobe Macromedia, and his job is to make the Linux Flash.

134
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:24,908
Rym: In fact, we saw way back when the job posting for this came out, and all the Linux people were, "Ooh, they're finally gonna fix

135
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:25,009
Rym: it.".

136
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:35,307
Scott: Yep, and there was this guy blogged the whole thing, you can go read the guy's blog, he keeps updating it, even today, you know, and you can see the whole development of Flash for Linux.

137
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:47,430
Scott: Recently, as in last week, two weeks ago, pretty recently, Flash 9 Beta, not the final version, but the Beta, came out for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

138
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:48,889
Scott: All three systems.

139
00:11:49,810 --> 00:12:07,467
Scott: And let me tell you, it is now the awesome, I mean, there are a lot of people having problems, you know, just, like, my parents had real problems on Linux, like, they'd go to websites, they'd want to do stuff, it wouldn't work, they couldn't go to a website and do what it said there, because it would just say, "Oh, you don't have Flash 8, tough

140
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:07,668
Scott: shit.".

141
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,930
Scott: Well, now they have Flash 9, and it is awesome.

142
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:17,150
Scott: The sound works, it's very fast, all the functions work when you try to play a game.

143
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,729
Rym: The only complaints I've seen were from people who don't understand Linux and didn't install it, right?

144
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:27,807
Scott: Yeah, I mean, all you have to do is take one file and put it in a folder, and then this will just work.

145
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,330
Scott: In Firefox, at least.

146
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,510
Scott: I haven't tried it with any other browsers, I probably should.

147
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,588
Rym: Some people have had trouble, because there is no 64-bit version.

148
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,630
Scott: Ah, that is true, there is no 64-bit version.

149
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:43,549
Rym: So if you're running a 64-bit computer, you have to have a 32-bit compiled version of Firefox, or it won't work.

150
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:44,950
Scott: Ah, that is true.

151
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:53,810
Rym: And a lot of people are mad, because they don't want to run 32-bit Firefox on their awesome 64-bit machine, even though, for Firefox, the performance gains are probably minimal if not negligible.

152
00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:03,421
Scott: Yeah, the one thing I do have to say, you know, if someone's talking about open source, and you don't, you know, a lot of people say, "What do I care if I can get the source, I don't know how to mess with the code,".

153
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:04,490
Scott: well, that's true.

154
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:15,230
Scott: But if source code is available for a program, if it's an open source program, it is possible to build that source code for any platform, for any chip ever.

155
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:29,726
Scott: And that is, you know, to me, that is really the most important thing about open source software, is that if the program's open source, it doesn't matter what computer you have, you know, you can get that program to work on that computer if the computer is powerful enough.

156
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:45,847
Scott: And Flash, while now it works for Linux, which is good, a lot of open source zealots aren't gonna use it, well, you know, good for them, but it is annoying that, you know, we don't have the source, so we can't compile it for 64-bit, we can't compile it for Amiga.

157
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,949
Scott: It's pretty much Windows, Mac, and Linux, 32-bit, and that's it.

158
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:54,250
Scott: They decide what platforms Flash 9 will work on, and we don't.

159
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,386
Rym: And it's not really that they're being evil in this case, it's that they really don't know.

160
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:06,870
Rym: I mean, they couldn't make a working Linux plugin for the longest time, they finally admitted they didn't know, and tried to hire someone who knew about Linux to do it for them.

161
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,728
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure this guy knows that it's not working in 64-bit, and I'm sure he's thinking about it.

162
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,430
Scott: I think he's probably just, you know, his blog probably has the answer.

163
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,950
Rym: I'm not talking about the guy, I'm talking about the company.

164
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:23,349
Rym: Oh yeah, but-- I mean, the company I work for now, they don't know anything about Linux or open source at all.

165
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:23,967
Scott: Wow.

166
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,349
Rym: I mean, I say, like I suggest, "Oh, just use an SSH tunnel for something," and I get blank looks.

167
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:29,143
Scott: Yeah.

168
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,019
Scott: I think that is really, you know, people say, "Oh,".

169
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:41,121
Scott: you know, they argue against open source, or they think that people argue against open source, like, "Oh, someone will hack it 'cause they can see your source and find your vulnerabilities and get you,".

170
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:43,844
Scott: or, "Oh, you know, it's free, it can't be

171
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:44,030
Scott: good.".

172
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,659
Scott: No, the real reason that open source doesn't succeed is because people don't know about it.

173
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:56,550
Scott: They're uninformed and ignorant of open source and Linux, and, you know, they either don't even know it exists, or they don't have the information.

174
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:11,970
Scott: And if we just had some sort of campaign of spreading the word, you know, that would do wonders more than, you know, arguing with people who come up with stupid arguments that don't mean anything, like, uh, what's another famous anti-open source argument?

175
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:15,030
Scott: "Oh, it won't work with anyone else's computers.

176
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,381
Scott: Well, we can't do

177
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:16,807
Scott: business.".

178
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:18,290
Scott: Yeah.

179
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,151
Rym: Well, that was a valid argument back in the days of Red Hat 5.

180
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:22,249
Scott: Yeah, now it's not.

181
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:30,520
Rym: Things of the day.

182
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,839
Rym: I can't say it in my usual loud way because I don't want to trip the fact that I don't have a compressor in front of me.

183
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,240
Rym: It's really hard to do the show.

184
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,899
Rym: I gotta be careful about all this stuff again.

185
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:40,840
Scott: Compressor.

186
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:42,520
Rym: Yeah.

187
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,038
Rym: Of course, I mean, I thought, "Oh, what if it doesn't sound that bad?

188
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:49,885
Rym: 'cause we've gotten better and people will, you know, oh, they didn't really need to spend money on that compressor,".

189
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:50,715
Rym: but we just listened to it.

190
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:51,060
Rym: and yeah.

191
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:52,900
Scott: Yeah, we need the compressor.

192
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,860
Scott: It makes things a lot nicer and easier, and Ray won't yell at me 'cause he's an ass.

193
00:15:57,262 --> 00:15:59,620
Rym: Yeah, I yell at Scott all the time about his microphone discipline.

194
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,620
Scott: Whatever.

195
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,100
Scott: I'll do what I want.

196
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,959
Scott: Do you have a thing of the day?

197
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:05,500
Rym: Well, I do have a thing of the day.

198
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,649
Rym: Once again, it seems I had this thing of the day for like three weeks, but I keep saying, "Oh, 'cause I always find something better on Monday,".

199
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,540
Rym: and once again, I was on Dig today and I was looking around.

200
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:23,659
Scott: I always read the science section of Dig, mostly- That's the section I mostly avoid, specifically the health subsection 'cause it's full of bullshit.

201
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,479
Rym: Now, in fact, that's the reason I go there.

202
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:25,705
Rym: Oh.

203
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:41,000
Rym: I go into the health section and I go into the upcoming stories and the main stories and I bury every piece of Randy, every piece of bullshit, every piece of incorrect science, every link to a crackpot blog, all the bad science out there.

204
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,000
Scott: I do this every day and I- So you bury 99% of the stories in that section.

205
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,460
Rym: I bury about 10 to 20 stories a day.

206
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:54,540
Rym: I also go into those stories and mod or dig everyone down who doesn't know what they're talking about.

207
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,980
Scott: Wow, you really don't have any time.

208
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:59,240
Scott: I don't do anything at work, but I read a comic book today.

209
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,160
Rym: Oh, you know, it doesn't take me long to dig people down.

210
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,894
Rym: When I go into a Dig thread, I play a Mr.

211
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:04,900
Rym: Period in this case.

212
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:11,098
Rym: I will just go through and dig anyone down who doesn't have proper grammar at a glance, no matter what they had to say.

213
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:12,480
Scott: Good move.

214
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,939
Rym: And then anyone who's talking Randy, it's usually easy to tell because they say certain kinds of words and if you see that word, it's obvious.

215
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:20,978
Rym: Yep.

216
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,299
Scott: Holistic is the word to watch out for.

217
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:32,119
Rym: So anyway, today there was a particular preponderance, I like my little alliteration, of Randy and it was all kind of similar Randy.

218
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,980
Rym: And then I noticed that all these Randy stories I was digging down and burying were from the same website.

219
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:44,260
Rym: And then I noticed they had also all been submitted by the same person.

220
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,238
Scott: Wait, wait, wait.

221
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:55,680
Scott: So maybe if we submit every single episode of GeekNights to Dig, over time, a bunch of them might get dug up crazily if we just keep doing it all day long.

222
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,139
Scott: Like if we take a day off work and just submit every episode of GeekNights to Dig one after the other.

223
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:01,299
Rym: It's worth a shot.

224
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,660
Scott: Yeah, and it worked for some person with a bunch of bullshit crackpot stuff.

225
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,640
Scott: It'll work for us, right?

226
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,920
Rym: Yeah, because some of these have gotten two or three hundred digs, which is really sad.

227
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:12,639
Scott: Some of them got to the front page.

228
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,609
Scott: They popped up in my Google Reader, which I wanted to talk about, but I'm not going to.

229
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:24,914
Rym: So my thing of the day is very simply, if you're on Dig, I highly recommend that you ignore anything ever posted by a user named Rhiannon1214.

230
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:29,480
Scott: In fact, can you make someone your enemy on Dig?

231
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,959
Rym: No, but you can block them so you never see anything they do.

232
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:33,259
Scott: Oh, I'm totally doing that.

233
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,159
Rym: See, I won't do that, because then I won't see them to bury them.

234
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,680
Scott: Oh, but you can book, oh, maybe, no, that's no good.

235
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,980
Scott: You don't want to mark them as a friend.

236
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:41,873
Rym: No, no.

237
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:48,850
Scott: What if you block them, right, and then you bookmark their page and bury them anything they have.

238
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:50,778
Rym: Something else I'd like to note about this.

239
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,413
Rym: This Rhiannon1214 may or may not be Mr.

240
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:04,620
Rym: Lou Rockwell, who apparently is the vice president of the Center for Libertarian Studies in Burlingame, California.

241
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:12,220
Scott: Wow, that's so fucked up, because it's so weird, because all the libertarians I know tend to be on the Randy side.

242
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,880
Scott: They don't like Randy stuff.

243
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,595
Scott: They're anti-scams and anti-bullshit medicine and they're for truth and science and all that other good stuff.

244
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:26,339
Scott: So someone to be all Randy and believing in bullshit medicine and being a libertarian, that's fucked up.

245
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,660
Rym: In fact, it says his name, comma, is an opponent of the central state, its wars, and its socialism.

246
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:34,099
Scott: Wow.

247
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,779
Rym: Yeah, you know I always say, I'm a libertarian with a lowercase l. That's the reason why.

248
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:42,399
Scott: Yeah, that guy sounds like a nutjob.

249
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,259
Rym: So he's got this nutjob blog and it has all this pseudoscience nutjob stuff, and this guy on Dig keeps linking to it constantly.

250
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,449
Scott: Wow.

251
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:56,080
Scott: Okay, I wish someone ... Yeah, actually, that'd be cool.

252
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,696
Scott: One of our listeners went through and dug every episode of GeekNights one after the other.

253
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:01,498
Scott: That way it wouldn't be us.

254
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:04,519
Rym: I would go dig them up, I guess.

255
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:05,536
Scott: Maybe.

256
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:06,518
Scott: The good ones.

257
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:08,320
Scott: This one I might dig down.

258
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,059
Scott: I might bury this one deep.

259
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,560
Rym: I think I'll bury every episode we do until we get that compressor back.

260
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,160
Rym: God damn.

261
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,550
Scott: God damn.

262
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:16,280
Scott: Alright.

263
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:21,060
Scott: Wow, it's so weird to look over at the compressor and the lights are not ... Alright.

264
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:34,159
Scott: My thing of the day, there's a show, there's a new TV show in the UK, so UK people, we need your help giving us more info on this, called The Big Idea, and it says here- Well, Scott, what's The Big Idea?

265
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:34,874
Scott: I don't know.

266
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,720
Scott: Well, they say that it's a TV show which pits inventors ... I'm reading from the website directly because I'm lazy.

267
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:47,334
Scott: It pits inventors and entrepreneurs against one another for a chance to have their invention or business idea realized and to win 100,000 pounds.

268
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,118
Scott: Alright, that sounds cool to me.

269
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:54,540
Rym: 100,000 pounds is a lot in American dollars.

270
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,251
Scott: Yeah, that's like almost 200,000 pounds.

271
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:03,733
Scott: And one of the commercials for the show is a video of 10,000 British pounds.

272
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,980
Scott: Now if you've never seen a single British pound coin, it's a really heavy coin.

273
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,560
Scott: I mean, it weighs, and it's thick.

274
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:16,440
Scott: It's like as thick as three quarters or two and a half quarters.

275
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:23,940
Scott: It's not as big as a quarter circumference radius size, but it's a big freaking coin.

276
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,855
Scott: You give someone a pound, it's like, "God damn, there's a

277
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:27,237
Scott: pound.".

278
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:33,439
Scott: And they lined up 10,000 pounds like dominoes, and they go ticka, ticka, ticka, ticka, ticka.

279
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:46,430
Rym: So we were going to talk about audio codecs today, like we said, to continue our codec theme, but one, we really don't want to waste a good episode on a night when we don't have all of our audio equipment together.

280
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,930
Scott: And two, our previous codec episode we didn't think went so well.

281
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:58,610
Rym: Yeah, because it seems like those of you in the audience who want to know the technical details can just look it up in Wikipedia or already know them.

282
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:05,229
Rym: And those of you who don't want the technical details don't really care at all about the codecs other than how to get them.

283
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,799
Scott: Yeah, we think we finally figured out.

284
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:14,830
Scott: the Monday episode is, you know, in college I took a lot of classes on like science, technology, and society.

285
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:24,050
Scott: There was actually a whole section of the liberal arts school called like STS, and I took that as a, I don't know if it was a minor, it was a concentration.

286
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,450
Scott: I think I took enough classes in it to be a minor, but I didn't do the paperwork.

287
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:28,436
Scott: I didn't care.

288
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:30,210
Scott: It didn't matter anyway.

289
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:38,790
Scott: And, you know, we're going to try to talk about like topics in science and technology, stuff like, you know, "Oh, well, how was this?

290
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,504
Scott: What kind of effect will this have on the

291
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:40,907
Scott: world?".

292
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,527
Scott: And, you know, "How does this change the way people think and the way people

293
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:44,829
Scott: act?".

294
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,869
Scott: And et cetera, et cetera.

295
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:52,730
Rym: Yeah, we're basically going to turn Mondays into more of an op-ed thing from our perspective as opposed to a straight up informative lecture.

296
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,030
Scott: Yeah, because the informative lecture seems to not work so well.

297
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:03,510
Scott: However, if you do have questions about computers and science, technology, and such, we don't know much about science.

298
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,408
Scott: Well, most science.

299
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:06,609
Rym: We have people we can ask.

300
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:08,029
Scott: Yes, we have people we can ask.

301
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,609
Scott: And we could probably solve your physics homework for you.

302
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:19,678
Rym: But actually, actually, yeah, I was bored out the other day and I ended up sitting down with my old program.

303
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:22,750
Rym: I wrote for my calculator and doing old physics problems.

304
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,489
Scott: Yeah, we could solve your physics homework for you, but we probably can't tell you any Stephen Hawking type shit.

305
00:23:27,631 --> 00:23:28,989
Rym: No, no, we can make stuff up.

306
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,189
Scott: We could definitely make stuff up.

307
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,994
Scott: Anyone could do that.

308
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:44,130
Scott: But if you do have questions about technology, like how to information and help, you can either ask us in our forums or you can try to find me on QNU, Q-U-N-U dot com, which is a place where you can go to get help.

309
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:46,130
Rym: Or why don't they just ask us in the forums?

310
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:46,831
Scott: That, too.

311
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:50,830
Scott: But you can get me like on IM through QNU if you need help right now.

312
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:53,330
Rym: Or you can just track down his AIM name and get him directly.

313
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,090
Scott: No, don't do that, because I really don't like it when people IM me who I don't know.

314
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,890
Rym: But it's trivial to find your AIM name.

315
00:23:59,171 --> 00:23:59,476
Scott: It is.

316
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:00,005
Scott: It is.

317
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:05,333
Scott: But I will most likely be rude to you and try to stop unless you're very unless you're really cool.

318
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:09,649
Scott: Like if you start saying really cool stuff, then I'll start talking to you because it'll be worth my time.

319
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:15,380
Scott: But most people who IM me that are strangers, my immediate reaction is, why is a stranger messaging me?

320
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:16,150
Scott: Go away.

321
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,732
Rym: Wait a minute.

322
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:17,034
Rym: Wait a minute.

323
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:20,810
Rym: So you don't like it when strangers talk to you, yet you're all about this sense of community.

324
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:28,789
Scott: Well, the thing is that most strangers having me tend to the track record of strangers IMing me has not been good.

325
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:29,456
Rym: You know what?

326
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:30,869
Scott: Most of them, not all of them.

327
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:36,496
Rym: Scott, I'll note that the track record of strangers talking to us in the real world isn't much better.

328
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,569
Rym: I know.

329
00:24:38,654 --> 00:24:40,650
Rym: So the situation is the same.

330
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,070
Scott: But in the real world, I can sum it up right away.

331
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,034
Scott: It doesn't take long.

332
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:49,637
Scott: And on IM, it's like wasting my time to figure out if it's worth it to talk to you.

333
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:50,790
Scott: You see what I'm saying?

334
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,330
Rym: Anyway, anyway, I could argue with that, but I won't.

335
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,169
Rym: I went to get a compressor because we'd probably get loud.

336
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:58,735
Rym: Yeah.

337
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:00,110
Scott: Anyway.

338
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:10,773
Rym: So the problem we had with the compressor gave us a topic for the show tonight because we noticed that, I mean, all my old equipment, I have a lot of old various bits of electronic hardware around.

339
00:25:10,813 --> 00:25:20,672
Rym: And in the hardware manual, if anything I bought in the 90s or the 80s, it has a little thing where you can call them and order any replacement parts for anything.

340
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:25,512
Rym: I mean, the Nintendo, you could just order an extra power adapter or an extra RF cable.

341
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:36,210
Rym: All my old electronic stuff, like my electronics kits, you could order extra resistors or the, well, again, the power cable or the face plate or anything like that.

342
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,209
Rym: But now when we, you know, this compressor, we lost the power cable to it.

343
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:45,552
Rym: There's no way in the instructions or the website, at least obvious way, to order this part.

344
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:49,469
Rym: We've asked them, but there's no actual obvious way to do it.

345
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,690
Rym: And stores like Radio Shack don't carry things like that anymore.

346
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:59,570
Scott: Yeah, back in the day, Radio Shack used to be, if you were just a normal person, you couldn't go to Radio Shack.

347
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:00,889
Scott: What were you going to get there?

348
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,890
Scott: You know, it was all a tandy computer.

349
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,109
Scott: Yeah, it was lol or a Radio Shack coco too.

350
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,690
Scott: No, it was a place for electronics hobbyists, people who wanted to make electronics, fix electronics, fiddle with electronics.

351
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:22,949
Scott: That was the majority of the store with soldering irons, wires, chips, resistors, all that kind of stuff just laid out there.

352
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,370
Scott: Nowadays, what's in that store?

353
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:25,711
Scott: Track.

354
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:31,389
Rym: It's like Scott said in the first half of the episode, it's a tiny Best Buy with less selection and higher prices.

355
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:31,971
Scott: Yep.

356
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:36,910
Scott: So it is another example of stuff getting dumb.

357
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:45,630
Scott: When I was a kid, I got a stereo, I think when I was 10, you know, and this had like a turntable, two tape decks, a radio, like a whole equalizer thing.

358
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:50,629
Scott: It was on this big wheeling stand and two big speakers that were as tall as it was, you know, big freaking thing.

359
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:51,010
Scott: Yeah.

360
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:54,550
Scott: And in the instruction book was a whole schematic of the entire stereo.

361
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,450
Scott: Like I could have built the stereo from the schematic and it came with the stereo.

362
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:03,252
Scott: So if it broke, I could have opened it up and killed myself, but I could have been fixing it.

363
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:07,950
Rym: Now, Scott, all of my audio equipment, even the newest stuff, everything I bought came with a full schematic.

364
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:09,249
Scott: Yeah, but that's audio equipment.

365
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:11,230
Scott: My video card doesn't come with one.

366
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,470
Rym: Well, because the schematic for your video card would be useless.

367
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:14,569
Rym: It's much more complex.

368
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,353
Scott: Yeah, I know.

369
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:17,930
Scott: But I'm saying you can go buy a stereo at Best Buy today.

370
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:18,828
Scott: You won't get a schematic.

371
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:23,710
Scott: If it's a consumer electronics appliance, it won't have any of that good stuff.

372
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,453
Scott: It'll just.

373
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:24,876
Scott: it'll just.

374
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,550
Scott: it's just a thing made for people to use.

375
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:34,790
Rym: But I feel like the audio equipment I bought, the schematic isn't there for people to use because they can't actually buy replacement parts or anything.

376
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:36,314
Rym: It's like it's.

377
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:48,929
Rym: I mean, I looked at it and I could think of a few people who would care about the schematic, but their market segment, the people who buy Behringer and Samson audio equipment are not going to be looking at the schematic very much.

378
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,128
Scott: I don't think they will know.

379
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,330
Scott: Maybe it's just to be cool or I don't know why they put it there.

380
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,690
Rym: I mean, I know why a lot of high end audio stuff has that.

381
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:01,132
Rym: I mean, you really want to know the path and figure out where noise is going to come from and all that.

382
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:08,656
Scott: Maybe they just put it there to make to look like high end audio equipment, you know, because there's probably some high end guy who will look at it and say, I'm not buying that.

383
00:28:08,676 --> 00:28:09,830
Scott: But he sees the schematic on.

384
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:11,270
Scott: He's like, ah, that's the sign of a good.

385
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,650
Rym: But he's actually a high end guy who look at the schematic and go, oh, he might be.

386
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:17,210
Scott: But there are those stupid people who think they're high end.

387
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,570
Scott: You know, the audio file types trick a few of them into buying your product.

388
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,050
Rym: That's probably why everything I bought has blue LEDs.

389
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:24,716
Scott: Oh, it could be.

390
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:27,130
Scott: blue LEDs are very clever.

391
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:33,670
Rym: Yeah, it's just frustrating that we lost a simple dumb piece of equipment, a power cable.

392
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:44,270
Rym: But because it was a specific power cable and there is no store within driving distance of us that sells generic power cables, we're stuck.

393
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:47,510
Rym: There is nothing we could do to have a compressor tonight.

394
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:55,790
Scott: You know, it's like there is this demand and it's a pretty high demand for, you know, a real electronics store like they had back in the day.

395
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,950
Rym: Well, is there really a demand?

396
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,230
Scott: But the demand isn't centralized enough in any one place for a physical store.

397
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:04,750
Scott: But to order on the Internet, it takes so long to get the product.

398
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,210
Scott: I mean, on the Internet, it's easy to get this kind of stuff.

399
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,059
Scott: You know, I mean, this particular.

400
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:11,150
Rym: really I looked in our particular one.

401
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:15,510
Scott: I mean, we could probably find a generic one on some other shady website pretty easily.

402
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,210
Scott: But this, you know, from the same company, it depends on the company.

403
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:24,621
Scott: But, you know, the Radio Shack website does have all the stuff that they used to have in stores all the time.

404
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:25,449
Scott: And so does the catalog.

405
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,950
Scott: They haven't taken anything out of it.

406
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:33,029
Scott: You can still get, you know, the pillow speaker, the famous Radio Shack pillow speaker still in there, you know, and all that good stuff.

407
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,310
Scott: But yeah, you can't get it immediately.

408
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:44,550
Scott: And a lot of electronic stuff you have an immediate need for, you know, if something breaks, you need to go out and get a new one right now.

409
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,170
Rym: Well, Scott, except the thing is, most people don't care.

410
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,310
Scott: Most people don't care.

411
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:50,130
Rym: So there really isn't a market for it.

412
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,650
Scott: Well, there is a demand.

413
00:29:52,170 --> 00:30:00,510
Scott: And, you know, while it's not a majority of the population is a minority, it is still a big enough number to be a lot of money.

414
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:07,170
Rym: See, I don't think it is at all, because if it's dispersed like that, then there's no way to have a business that could serve that purpose and make a profit.

415
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:08,649
Scott: Internet business, pretty much.

416
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:13,229
Rym: But if it's an Internet business, then people can just get from other Internet businesses that already exist.

417
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:13,896
Scott: I know.

418
00:30:14,243 --> 00:30:14,468
Scott: I know.

419
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:17,370
Scott: And those are the Internet businesses that are making money.

420
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,032
Rym: And even then, I still don't think there's enough demand because people don't care at all.

421
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:23,190
Rym: Very few people use equipment like this.

422
00:30:23,492 --> 00:30:25,370
Rym: And what percentage of them lose the power cable?

423
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:29,410
Rym: And how many of them just buy another piece of equipment?

424
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,450
Scott: Yeah, it is a good point.

425
00:30:31,972 --> 00:30:38,510
Scott: We often complain about non-geeks not knowing enough about computers, not knowing enough about technology.

426
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:46,610
Scott: And I think part of that is, you know, not just because you no longer have to know, but because they don't even provide the information.

427
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,530
Scott: You know, they just totally hide everything.

428
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:56,342
Scott: So even someone who might have figured it out on their own, you know, they're not going to because it's all this hidden mystery stuff.

429
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:57,848
Scott: now instead of being, you know.

430
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:06,652
Scott: Instead of being here it is, but you don't have to know it, it's we're not even going to show it to you.

431
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:12,710
Rym: Yeah, well, I guess the companies are smart in that they don't make any more money by providing all of these niceties.

432
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:23,510
Rym: I mean, a lot of equipment, electronic equipment back in the day would even come with like some resistors with it or an extra bit just in case it broke.

433
00:31:23,611 --> 00:31:26,370
Rym: So you could just replace it and instructions on how to replace it.

434
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:33,130
Scott: Well, I think that actually is because back in the day, a lot of those things are prone to breakage and you needed that or else you were screwed.

435
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,290
Rym: Yeah, but even back then, I think including those things was from a market perspective.

436
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,810
Rym: I mean, I wasn't going to compare then to now on that regard.

437
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:45,150
Rym: I was going to say, but back then they didn't make any sales by having that in there.

438
00:31:45,411 --> 00:31:52,389
Rym: That was a nice thing to do, but I don't think a significant number of people would have not bought the product had it not come with that.

439
00:31:53,231 --> 00:32:03,748
Scott: I think also, if they don't allow expect you or if you're not expected to be able to repair your electronic devices and they make it so that you're so dumb, you can't possibly, you

440
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,692
Scott: know, even

441
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:08,833
Scott: think of repairing your electronic devices, you'll just buy a new one whenever one breaks.

442
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:16,286
Rym: Of course, that might also just come out of the fact, like with the video card, that a lot of things are complex to the point now that you really can't repair them.

443
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:25,070
Rym: or it's with, you know, economy of scale, it's not cost effective from anyone's point of view to just do anything other than replace, like a vacuum cleaner.

444
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,832
Rym: There used to be vacuum repairmen or VCRs, they're VCR repairmen, TVs, there were TV repairmen.

445
00:32:31,714 --> 00:32:45,230
Rym: It takes so much manual labor to repair a TV that it's always cheaper, both from a labor perspective and a money perspective, to buy a new TV than to hire someone to spend their time and effort fixing your individual problem.

446
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:48,000
Scott: There are still a few TV repairmen

447
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,442
Scott: out there,

448
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:58,159
Scott: but they don't really do a lot of business, not that there's, you know, I mean, occasionally they might replace a backlight in an LCD, you know, but I said, you know, but

449
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:09,387
Rym: yeah, for anyone who wasn't listening recently, Scott has, I guess, gotten a virus that interjects the word, you know, into random sentences on a semi-regular basis.

450
00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:19,970
Scott: The point is, a lot of those repairs, if they get done now, are done by the factory or by the retailer, like Best Buy, and they sell the units as refurbished.

451
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:20,893
Rym: Well, you know why?

452
00:33:21,013 --> 00:33:25,247
Rym: Because if they, I mean, they know the types of problems that a product is prone to.

453
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:34,250
Rym: So if they get the products in, they can ship them off to an expert center where people have everything they need to fix them as efficiently as possible and get them back out.

454
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:36,770
Rym: And in that way, it's cheaper than manufacturing new ones.

455
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,970
Rym: They can sell them refurbished, recoup some of their costs.

456
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:49,510
Rym: But for an individual to go somewhere and get it repaired, they have to go to an expert who has to spend a lot of time figuring out what their problem is, figuring out how to solve it, solving it.

457
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:56,490
Rym: And by then, it's already cost more net human resources than just manufacturing a new one in the huge economy of scale factory.

458
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,367
Scott: Yeah, there does seem to be a business in computer repairs because it's a whole.

459
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:04,730
Scott: software versus hardware is a whole different, what do you call it?

460
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:05,894
Scott: Paradigm?

461
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:07,469
Scott: Yeah, that's the word I was looking for.

462
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:12,370
Scott: Ah, you know, finally, I said, what's the word I'm looking for?

463
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,552
Scott: And Rym said the right word instead of going, I don't know what the hell word you're looking for.

464
00:34:15,592 --> 00:34:18,270
Rym: Well, usually because you'll say, blah, blah, blah, what's the word?

465
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,629
Rym: And I'll list like 10 words like, nah, nah, not that one.

466
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,670
Scott: Nah, we got it right on the first try this time.

467
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,212
Scott: We did.

468
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:35,929
Scott: And, you know, there seems to be a business in computer repairs because people don't know about computers, but they have one, they need one and they break often, especially if their windows can Dells and stuff.

469
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:44,130
Scott: Well, there's also the fact that yet, but there still seems to be a large contingent of people who get spyware and they'll just buy a new computer.

470
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:50,190
Rym: Well, yeah, because they think the computer is slowing down and they figure obviously it must be the hardware getting old.

471
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:51,170
Rym: So they buy a new computer.

472
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,090
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what to say about that.

473
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,610
Rym: I think we just need to open our computer shop and capitalize on that.

474
00:34:58,634 --> 00:34:59,208
Scott: I think we do.

475
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,032
Rym: I just don't know.

476
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:05,869
Rym: I think I would still feel like I was cheating someone if I charged them 80 bucks to de-spyware their machine.

477
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,669
Scott: No, I don't know, man.

478
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:11,409
Scott: It just screwed up.

479
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:27,310
Rym: You know, to go off on a tangent, this is a problem that a lot of technology professionals have in that they don't see the work they do as being valuable or difficult or full, you know, requiring much effort because the work is actually really easy because it's the thing we specialize in.

480
00:35:27,553 --> 00:35:28,288
Rym: We know about it.

481
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:34,169
Rym: So when someone asks us to fix their computer, we usually just do it and don't even think about charging money or anything.

482
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:42,330
Rym: So a lot of people now have this expectation that technological or computer support is free and they could just ask their geek friend.

483
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:46,110
Rym: And then as a result, they don't actually learn anything on their own.

484
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:47,989
Rym: And at the same time, we don't get paid.

485
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:58,490
Scott: Yeah, and it just makes things worse and sort of a spiral if they keep asking for more help and we keep spending more time and it gets more and more annoying and, you know, then they never learn anything.

486
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,189
Scott: No one ever figures out how their computer work.

487
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:08,901
Scott: And it's it's really seems like the consumer electronics industry wants to make everyone dumb so they can take more money away from them instead of.

488
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:14,230
Scott: if people were smart, it would be really hard for them to make money, especially look at cell phones.

489
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:19,830
Scott: If people knew about technology, cell phone companies couldn't make any money because no one would pay for a ringtone.

490
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:21,849
Scott: No one would pay to download a video.

491
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:30,949
Scott: Everyone would plug their cell phones into their computers with USB or Bluetooth and do everything from there for free with their home Internet connection.

492
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,290
Scott: They customize the hell out of their phone.

493
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:41,389
Rym: I think that's very much a post hoc Procter hoc thing in that the cell phone companies know and they restrict the technology specifically to prevent that.

494
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,806
Rym: And even if they I mean, a lot of people are finding out that cell phones the rest of the world are much better than U.S.

495
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,309
Rym: cell phones and there's nothing they can do about it.

496
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:51,790
Rym: It's not like they can go to the competition.

497
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,042
Scott: Well, no, but there are quite all the it seemed.

498
00:36:55,263 --> 00:37:01,550
Scott: if you go to forums like I was looking at the forums for the Motorola Q, you know, which is a Motorola's new smartphone.

499
00:37:02,295 --> 00:37:02,557
Scott: I don't know.

500
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:03,103
Scott: I might get it.

501
00:37:03,163 --> 00:37:03,790
Scott: I'm not sure yet.

502
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,930
Scott: I got to actually play with one.

503
00:37:05,652 --> 00:37:09,293
Scott: All the smart people who know what they're doing have unlocked these things and they do all the shit.

504
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,930
Rym: But a lot of phones just can't be unlocked.

505
00:37:12,512 --> 00:37:13,839
Scott: Well, those are shit phones.

506
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:17,830
Scott: that, you know, the smartphones are the phones that are actually capable of doing interesting things.

507
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,149
Scott: The normal everyday phones aren't really capable by old phone.

508
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,710
Rym: That old ass phone.

509
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,502
Rym: Remember that thing?

510
00:37:23,522 --> 00:37:23,685
Rym: Yeah.

511
00:37:24,332 --> 00:37:34,138
Rym: That thing had GPS stuff and I could have done a lot of stuff with that, but they specifically prevented in the firmware any of the GPS data from ever leaving out of a data port.

512
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:34,608
Scott: Yeah.

513
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:38,389
Scott: There's some things a phone can do and some things a phone can't.

514
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:45,990
Rym: But I think in terms of other industries, I doubt many of them actively think let's keep the customers dumb and milk them for money.

515
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:54,610
Rym: I'll bet it's just they think it's not worth it to provide a level of support or we don't have to care about it or, huh, they're buying more computers, whatever.

516
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:55,494
Scott: All right.

517
00:37:55,836 --> 00:37:57,870
Scott: But what was the thinking back in the day?

518
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:11,350
Scott: Who was the guy who said, you know, when they were putting together the instruction manual for my, you know, two tape decks and a, you know, turntable, any, you know, and a turntable stereo that they should put the circuitry diagram in?

519
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,215
Rym: You know what I'll bet it was?

520
00:38:12,276 --> 00:38:15,729
Rym: The engineer who designed it said these are the things that are commonly going to fail.

521
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,510
Rym: Let's include them and some instructions.

522
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:21,870
Rym: And now there is a middle manager who says, why would I include that?

523
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,813
Rym: That just costs more money.

524
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:36,010
Rym: I think the engineers used to be closer to the final product, which wasn't always a good thing because it often ended with somewhat obscure ergonomics or somewhat obscure interfaces.

525
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:45,410
Rym: Non-intuitive methods of using things, instructions that were written not for the consumer, but for another engineer.

526
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:53,990
Scott: You know, I think it also goes back to the whole open source, closed source thing is back in the day, originally, computers were all open source.

527
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,570
Scott: There was no such thing as closed source.

528
00:38:56,191 --> 00:39:00,846
Scott: You know, everyone knew the source code because you wrote an assembly and that you looked at it and there it was.

529
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:08,050
Scott: And then they had, you know, the computer clubs that people like Steve Jobs and Woz and Bill Gates and all the things they did.

530
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,130
Scott: That was all open source.

531
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,630
Scott: Everyone was showing off what they did.

532
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,310
Scott: And, you know, all the circuitry.

533
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:15,290
Scott: You'd go to Radio Shack, you'd buy a computer.

534
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,830
Scott: Everything was obvious.

535
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:21,095
Scott: You know, you just bought the same chips that were in that computer, put together your own computer.

536
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,130
Scott: Everyone knew how everything worked.

537
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,390
Scott: All the documentation was, you know, gettable in some way, even if it was hard to get.

538
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:29,068
Scott: Everyone was sharing.

539
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:36,210
Scott: And then they closed up the source and they also closed up the hardware documentation and all that other stuff all at the same time.

540
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:42,489
Rym: Well, I know the 486 that I got, my first computer, my first real computer, at least, came with two instruction books.

541
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,269
Rym: It came with an instruction book for all the software it came with.

542
00:39:45,811 --> 00:40:02,149
Rym: And it came with an instruction book for the hardware that went down to showing the voltages, the pin outs on the serial cables and the parallel ports and the internal comports and the modem and all the PCI cards and where the firmware stuff and a diagram of the motherboard, what all the dip switches did.

543
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,210
Scott: Yeah, I mean, some stuff still comes with a pretty good manual.

544
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:19,630
Scott: But if you compare like the motherboard manual I got for my Pentium 3450 to the one that I got for the newest computer, there is a tremendous, tremendous difference in the amount of useful information there.

545
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:28,490
Scott: I mean, the one that came with the Pentium 3450 motherboard, it tells you what every single pin on the motherboard does, even the ones you're never going to use.

546
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:32,390
Scott: And it tells you every single BIOS option and exactly what it does.

547
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:39,609
Scott: Now, the new ones are just kind of like, yeah, choose this and this and this and this and very vague descriptions of what things do.

548
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:47,710
Scott: And it doesn't tell you which pin exactly is which, just like, yeah, those pins over there are kind of for this and those ones are kind of for that.

549
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:48,960
Scott: You'll figure it out.

550
00:40:49,808 --> 00:40:49,970
Rym: Yeah.

551
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,592
Rym: Anyway, we just ran in for a bit since we kind of got thrown off topic by not having a compressor.

552
00:40:54,612 --> 00:41:02,230
Rym: I apologize again for the audio quality, which may be more or less apparent to you, depending on whether or not you're listening in a car or whatever.

553
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:05,750
Scott: If you're listening in a car, this episode might be unlistenable.

554
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:06,574
Rym: Yeah.

555
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:14,734
Rym: Luckily, I think we'll mitigate this by possibly playing our Luke Crane interview tomorrow and hopefully by Wednesday we'll have a power cable so we can use the compressor again.

556
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:16,670
Scott: Who knows when we're going to have a power cable?

557
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,590
Scott: We might have to put in like a special order for a new compressor.

558
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,587
Scott: If anyone wants a compressor without a power cable, we will sell it to you.

559
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,432
Scott: Possibly.

560
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:29,672
Rym: I'm pretty sure we can get a hold of a power cable, hopefully, if we can't, though.

561
00:41:30,118 --> 00:41:31,110
Rym: Yeah, we'll think of something.

562
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:31,510
Rym: Yep.

563
00:41:38,878 --> 00:41:40,960
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

564
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,599
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

570
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,500
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

571
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:10,440
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

572
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,300
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
