1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:11,860
Guest: We try not to think about the scariest one of all, the gigantic half-dragon, half-octopus, half-humanoid, great old one himself, Cthulhu, waiting to return from his city beneath the sea!

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:22,980
Guest: Who day and night must slumber in relay, wave his tentacles, having nasty dreams, and who has the might as master of relay to drive humanity insane?

3
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:28,840
Guest: Cthulhu, Cthulhu, tentacles!

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,400
Scott: Cthulhu, Cthulhu, tentacles!

5
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,681
Scott: Hello there.

6
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:48,140
Scott: As I'm recording this, it is Thursday, and tomorrow the Watchmen movie, as I'm sure many people realize, will be in theaters all across the United States of America.

7
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:55,620
Scott: And, you know, I haven't seen the movie yet, obviously, but I've read the book, you know, three, four, maybe even five times.

8
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:05,480
Scott: And it is in the news, and it has become quite apparent to me, that there is something that has changed in the movie, having to do with the ending of the book.

9
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:11,700
Scott: And I don't know what they changed it to, but it is common knowledge that something has been changed.

10
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:23,280
Scott: And some people on the internet and other places are commenting, you know, "Oh, it's a good change," or "Oh, the change, you know, it works just as well," or some other such thing.

11
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,679
Scott: Well, not knowing what they changed it to, I don't know if it works just as well.

12
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:35,660
Scott: But I do have many reasons why I think that it must be what it was.

13
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:47,020
Scott: Now, I'm going to spoil Watchmen here, so if you have never read the book, you should probably stop listening right now, because it is one of the greatest graphic works of all time.

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:57,060
Scott: And having it ruined for you really, even if you don't think, you know, it's so great, or you don't care a lot about it, that's because you haven't read it yet.

15
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,825
Scott: All right, so let's just get right down to it.

16
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:07,160
Scott: At the end of Watchmen, right, Ozymandias releases his giant squid-like nasty monster.

17
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,928
Scott: People seem to call it the squid, right?

18
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,898
Scott: It's not really a squid, but that's what they call it.

19
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,402
Scott: On to New York.

20
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:21,440
Scott: Thus, you know, he kills many, many people, but seemingly unites the world against this common threat of alien invasion.

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:31,780
Scott: And I think that there are at least two major reasons that I'm pretty sure were in the minds of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons while they were making Watchmen.

22
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:33,325
Scott: But there are many other reasons.

23
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:37,280
Scott: they were not thinking that also it must have been a squid.

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,685
Scott: It could not have been, you know, a nuke.

25
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:46,280
Scott: It could not have been some sort of biological weapon or a terrorist attack or any of these other sorts of things.

26
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:54,420
Scott: And I will tell you now the two major reasons why it must have been a big, nasty extraterrestrial or seemingly extraterrestrial monster.

27
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:58,297
Scott: Reason number one is the surface level.

28
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:58,780
Scott: reason here.

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,140
Scott: Ozymandias was trying to unite the world against a common foe.

30
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:03,761
Scott: Right.

31
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:05,465
Scott: And that and thus bring about peace.

32
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:11,680
Scott: We had this situation where the people of the United States reunited against their common foe of Russia.

33
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:12,242
Scott: Right.

34
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:18,440
Scott: In the or the Soviet Union, the Soviets were united in their common enemy of the United States.

35
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,781
Scott: Right.

36
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:25,260
Scott: So by creating a third external common foe for all humanity.

37
00:03:25,842 --> 00:03:26,124
Scott: Right.

38
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:29,040
Scott: You could unite the world against that common foe.

39
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,880
Scott: This is a common idea of neoconservative political ideology.

40
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,680
Scott: When I say neoconservative, I don't mean, you know, the way that word is used today.

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,100
Scott: I mean, the way the word neoconservative was originally used to describe people like, you know, Leo Strauss and such.

42
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:54,680
Scott: But anyway, if he wants to unite the world, this threat really needs to be external to Earth.

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,353
Scott: You can't unite all of humanity if the threat is manmade.

44
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:00,360
Scott: So if it was a nuke, let's say nuke New York.

45
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,741
Scott: Right.

46
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:06,380
Scott: People would think it was the Russians sneaking in with some sort of suitcase nuke or something like that.

47
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,641
Scott: Right.

48
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:13,480
Scott: If it was some sort of, you know, terrorist attack, a biological weapon, well, there would be a significant possibility.

49
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:20,700
Scott: And the most reasonable explanation, you know, Occam's razor would be that that biological attack was from Earth.

50
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:26,560
Scott: You know, if it was, you know, even if he made it look like the nuke came from space.

51
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:27,003
Scott: Right.

52
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:27,526
Scott: They would be.

53
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:29,800
Scott: it would be very easy to disbelieve it.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,167
Scott: Oh, it could have been some trick.

55
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,400
Scott: It could have been some manmade technology.

56
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:41,280
Scott: So just in the surface level of Ozymandias achieving his goal of uniting the world against some common foe.

57
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:50,520
Scott: The threat needed to be completely and undeniably, without any doubt, extraterrestrial in origin and real.

58
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:59,560
Scott: And that, you know, the speed giant squid from space that releases the psychic attack, you know, fills that bill quite nicely.

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,960
Scott: Now, there are perhaps other things that could fit that bill quite nicely, you know, say, I mean, if you think about the movie Independence Day.

60
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,201
Scott: Right.

61
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:08,086
Scott: That's exactly what happened in that movie.

62
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:12,480
Scott: You had these UFOs came from space only actually was an alien invasion.

63
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,782
Scott: You know, that's a problem.

64
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:22,140
Scott: But and the entire world, you know, they show you at the end of the movie, all like, you know, Israelis and Palestinians hugging each other and all this stuff.

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,501
Scott: Right.

66
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:25,072
Scott: It's because, you know, humanity was threatened.

67
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,719
Scott: They united against his common foe.

68
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:27,681
Scott: OK.

69
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:38,080
Scott: The second reason that I think it must have been this big nasty squid is sort of obvious in that this big nasty squid monster really evokes Cthulhu.

70
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,142
Scott: It's obvious.

71
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:40,125
Scott: it evokes Cthulhu.

72
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:40,366
Scott: Right.

73
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:43,156
Scott: The big tentacled monster of of H.P.

74
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:44,200
Scott: Lovecraft's creation.

75
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,581
Scott: Right.

76
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:50,791
Scott: And it is no secret that Alan Moore, at least, is a big fan of H.P.

77
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:56,520
Scott: Lovecraft, as as myself, as are many other geeks out there in the world.

78
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:06,180
Scott: I mean, Alan Moore, you know, he's had a there are many mentions of Cthulhu in one of the parts of the recent League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Black Dossier.

79
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,892
Scott: Alan Moore's Yogoth Cultures book has many Cthulhu ish H.P.

80
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:14,920
Scott: Lovecraftian mentions and nods in it.

81
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:17,405
Scott: He is a big fan of these sorts of things.

82
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:19,750
Scott: And the Watchmen is no exception.

83
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,874
Scott: now, specifically when you think of H.P.

84
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,620
Scott: Lovecraft, you know, and big tentacled monsters.

85
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,202
Scott: I mean, H.P.

86
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:30,520
Scott: Lovecraft wrote a lot a lot of things, you know, shoggits and old ones and deep ones and all sorts of things.

87
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,900
Scott: But Cthulhu sort of comes to that, you know, it's it's the one people are most familiar with.

88
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,852
Scott: And if you haven't read The Call of Cthulhu.

89
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:39,253
Scott: Right.

90
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:41,400
Scott: The short story, The Call of Cthulhu.

91
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:44,250
Scott: I highly, highly recommend you read it.

92
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,234
Scott: It's a short story.

93
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,920
Scott: It'll take you maybe 10 minutes.

94
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:49,949
Scott: You can just find it on the Internet, the full text of it.

95
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:50,149
Scott: Right.

96
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,820
Scott: I don't know if it's in the public domain, but there are websites just have the full text.

97
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,386
Scott: You can just read it if you really want to pay for it.

98
00:06:56,426 --> 00:07:02,360
Scott: I'm sure you can easily get it, you know, on, you know, many, many places by legitimate means.

99
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,889
Scott: Usually they sell Lovecraftian.

100
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:08,140
Scott: when you buy a book of Lovecraft stuff, you get a whole bunch of stories in there.

101
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:13,760
Scott: So if you buy a book, you'll probably get Call of Cthulhu and thing on the doorstep and a whole bunch of other stories all in one book.

102
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:22,720
Scott: But anyway, if you haven't read The Call of Cthulhu, this is probably a reason why you don't think the squid monster is necessary.

103
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:23,081
Scott: Right.

104
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:27,920
Scott: Let me summarize what the story of Call of Cthulhu is for you.

105
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,300
Scott: But first, I want to read the very first paragraph of the story Call of Cthulhu to you.

106
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,144
Scott: This is the very first paragraph of the story.

107
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:42,860
Scott: The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.

108
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,780
Scott: We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity.

109
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,527
Scott: And it was not meant that we should voyage far.

110
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:56,060
Scott: The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little.

111
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:12,640
Scott: But some day the pie, the piecing together of disassociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

112
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:26,540
Scott: So you see here, right, what he's saying in this first paragraph is like, look, you know, it's because humans don't know things that we aren't basically driven to insanity.

113
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,927
Scott: There are things that man was not meant to know.

114
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:41,359
Scott: And one day science will find these things and thus we will be completely driven insane by them, unable to comprehend them, you know, and it'll be the end of it.

115
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,804
Scott: All right.

116
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:45,737
Scott: And the story Call of Cthulhu goes like such.

117
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:46,300
Scott: There is a man.

118
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:49,426
Scott: He's sort of just, you know, your average guy.

119
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:50,668
Scott: It's told in the first person.

120
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,840
Scott: And pretty much before the story even started, his his uncle died.

121
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,120
Scott: And this was sort of like the weird professor uncle, you know, that didn't have any children.

122
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:02,565
Scott: And he was a widower.

123
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:02,946
Scott: Right.

124
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:07,180
Scott: So this guy is going to sort of take care of this, you know, strange uncle's estate.

125
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,380
Scott: Pretty, pretty typical setup for, you know, sort of a pulpy kind of story.

126
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:17,320
Scott: And while he's going through the uncle's things, he finds a box of strange stuff.

127
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,995
Scott: And he was a professor of, you know, archaeology or something like that, you know.

128
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:23,660
Scott: So, you know, having strange stuff.

129
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,332
Scott: But this one particular box of stuff was very, very interesting.

130
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:29,800
Scott: And our main character was very curious about it.

131
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:34,260
Scott: And this box contained many strange things and strange writings and whatnot.

132
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,111
Scott: And most notably, it contained this one bas relief.

133
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:39,460
Scott: And I'm pretty sure I think that's how it's pronounced, the bas relief.

134
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,664
Scott: It's bas relief.

135
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:40,945
Scott: Right.

136
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:45,440
Scott: So it's basically a small, you know, sort of a sculpture object.

137
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,267
Scott: You know, it's a. it's a relief.

138
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:49,332
Scott: You can look it up online.

139
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:50,799
Scott: What a relief is, if you don't know.

140
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:56,980
Scott: And, you know, the image on this relief was just so striking that he sort of was compelled.

141
00:09:57,622 --> 00:10:00,352
Scott: And his curiosity compelled him to find out more.

142
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:02,800
Scott: So he began to investigate.

143
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:07,640
Scott: Now, you see, this goes back to what was said in the first paragraph of the story.

144
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:08,003
Scott: Right.

145
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,219
Scott: There are things that man was not meant to know.

146
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:14,980
Scott: You find out information that you didn't really want to know, but you were so curious.

147
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,584
Scott: And once you found it, you were driven insane.

148
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:29,320
Scott: Well, in the course of his investigation of the this box of weird stuff and this relief, he finds out about, you know, crazy cults and he finds out about, you know, all sorts of nasty monsters.

149
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:35,240
Scott: And then he finds, you know, Cthulhu, you know, and he learns, you know, basically too much.

150
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:36,766
Scott: And it drives him mad.

151
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:46,820
Scott: And, you know, it all relates to his uncle died sort of, you know, following the same pursuit of, you know, tracking down and learning things he was not meant to know.

152
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:54,800
Scott: And if you look at how this relates to Watchmen, right, you can see how, you know, Rorschach, especially, but also the others.

153
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:55,182
Scott: Right.

154
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,960
Scott: We're investigating throughout the book.

155
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:06,300
Scott: And at the end, they found things that they found Ozymandias plan, things they were not meant to know.

156
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:14,800
Scott: And it drove them, you know, sort of crazy, you know, mad, if you know, in a way, especially, you know, Rorschach, who found this.

157
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,029
Scott: And, you know, then look at the comedian.

158
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:17,290
Scott: Right.

159
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:19,720
Scott: He he's dead at the beginning the story.

160
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:28,580
Scott: But, you know, he found out what was going on on that island, things that man was not meant to know and thus was driven completely mad by it.

161
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,645
Scott: And much is the same.

162
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:34,900
Scott: So it is entirely fitting that Cthulhu would be the thing that was at the end.

163
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,321
Scott: Right.

164
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:36,505
Scott: It totally makes sense.

165
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:54,360
Scott: And Ozymandias, I think he more fits the role of the cultists, you know, worshipping Cthulhu, trying to wake him up from his from his sleep, you know, and thus, you know, sort of already being mad like a cultist, but but not being driven mad by this journey for knowledge.

166
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,769
Scott: It's like the cultists already know about Cthulhu.

167
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:57,030
Scott: Right.

168
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,700
Scott: They're just sort of crazy and are trying to bring them around.

169
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Scott: And I think that's that's the role that Ozymandias fills is the role of the cultist in the story of the Call of Cthulhu.

170
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:09,114
Scott: Now, the other things about Cthulhu, right.

171
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:10,340
Scott: Think about Cthulhu himself.

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,320
Scott: Cthulhu is basically a big, giant, nasty dragon squid, humanoid monster from outer space, actually.

173
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:22,048
Scott: And he sleeps in a place called Relay.

174
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:27,280
Scott: It's basically an undersea, you know, sort of place that is hidden away from humanity.

175
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:28,629
Scott: And he's sleeping there.

176
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,120
Scott: And if he ever wakes up, we're all fucked.

177
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:42,199
Scott: But right now he's sleeping and he's, you know, while he's sleeping, he's having these really nasty dreams and these nasty dreams that he's having are affecting, you know, the minds of people around the earth.

178
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:51,940
Scott: You know, artists and and, you know, really creative people are being driven mad because the dreams of Cthulhu are getting into their minds as well.

179
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:56,799
Scott: You know, and think about how this relates to the Watchmen.

180
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,020
Scott: Right.

181
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,737
Scott: The monster in Watchmen was crafted by artists and writers.

182
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:03,420
Scott: Right.

183
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:14,000
Scott: Putting, you know, their twisted creations, the things of their twisted and nightmare dreams into, you know, this brain of a psychic.

184
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:14,402
Scott: Right.

185
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:17,820
Scott: That would release a psychic attack and drive everyone insane.

186
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:24,196
Scott: I mean, Cthulhu himself, you know, you think about just the real world, right, was created by a writer, H.P.

187
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,840
Scott: Lovecraft, who is a little insane.

188
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,568
Scott: So you're sort of you see how this fits into the story of Cthulhu.

189
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:36,500
Scott: instead of the monster giving, you know, he wants to create a monster whose nasty dreams will drive people insane.

190
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,840
Scott: Well, instead, let's take, you know, the artists and their nasty dreams, put them into this brain.

191
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,648
Scott: And thus we will create Cthulhu by, you know, the reverse process.

192
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:52,080
Scott: You know, if Cthulhu causes these nasty dreams, we take nasty dreams and put them together.

193
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,383
Scott: We'll get Cthulhu.

194
00:13:55,547 --> 00:14:00,176
Scott: So, yeah, the you know, the image of this big monster at the end evokes.

195
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:02,440
Scott: Cthulhu evokes this story.

196
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,520
Scott: And if you know this story, you can see how well it fits right along with Watchmen.

197
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:10,273
Scott: And if you know how much Alan Moore loves H.P.

198
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:11,640
Scott: Lovecraft, which is no secret.

199
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:14,132
Scott: This whole thing is painfully obvious.

200
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:15,820
Scott: It is without a doubt intentional.

201
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:16,780
Scott: Right.

202
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:27,060
Scott: And replacing that monster with anything else, you know, I mean, that did not evoke Cthulhu, did not evoke Lovecraftian horror would sort of not fit.

203
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,401
Scott: Right.

204
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:31,520
Scott: You'd be losing this whole aspect of the story that was without a doubt intentional.

205
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,379
Scott: I mean, if it was some other sort of alien invasion, let's say it was, you know, green men.

206
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:36,122
Scott: Right.

207
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:40,920
Scott: It would achieve the same effect for Ozymandias, perhaps if executed properly.

208
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,220
Scott: But it would not evoke this story of Cthulhu.

209
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,188
Scott: It would not evoke the idea of people being driven insane.

210
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:53,840
Scott: The whole part about, you know, artists, you know, working together to on the island to create this.

211
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,580
Scott: The whole part about the comedian discovering it and being driven insane.

212
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,331
Scott: None of those things would make sense.

213
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:01,480
Scott: None of those things would fit.

214
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:04,755
Scott: You know, if it was a nuke, the comedian wouldn't have been driven mad by it.

215
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,841
Scott: Right.

216
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,927
Scott: Only it was biological attack.

217
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:12,480
Scott: He wouldn't have been driven mad only by some sort of Lovecraftian horror.

218
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,100
Scott: Do all those other pieces of the story fit together?

219
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:21,040
Scott: Now, there's one other aspect of Lovecraftian heart that I would like to point out in the Watchmen.

220
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,125
Scott: That is Antarctica.

221
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:23,331
Scott: There are.

222
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:25,360
Scott: there is a Lovecraftian story.

223
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,642
Scott: I forget which one it is.

224
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:34,880
Scott: I should have I should have looked this up before I recorded this where, you know, there is horror in Antarctica and basically the old ones, some alien race.

225
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:36,688
Scott: You know, they're not, you know, Cthulhu.

226
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,520
Scott: They're just, you know, some aliens that are much more advanced.

227
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:45,220
Scott: We're in Antarctica, sort of, you know, frozen in the ice, if you will.

228
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,040
Scott: And, you know, people go there and discover it and find things that man was not meant to know.

229
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:59,160
Scott: And if you know the end of Watchmen, Ozymandias is, you know, Fort Karnak is in Antarctica.

230
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:00,820
Scott: That is no accident.

231
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:07,900
Scott: I believe that, you know, and I will argue that it was clearly a reference to that Lovecraftian story.

232
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:21,020
Scott: And, you know, when you piece that together with the Cthulhu tale and the monster and the psychic wave that drives everyone insane and the artists and writers that create it and the comedian being driven insane.

233
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,184
Scott: You know, I haven't seen the movie yet.

234
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:30,080
Scott: Maybe it's a good movie, but I've heard that there is no big monster at the end of the movie.

235
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:39,880
Scott: And from my point of view, you know, based on these arguments and some others I can make from, you know, other aspects such as science and politics and psychology.

236
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:48,100
Scott: It has to be a squid or squid monster Lovecraftian horror for it to work as intended.

237
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:55,680
Scott: And without that, I think you are losing a rather significant part of the story of Watchmen and a significant part of the impact of the ending.

238
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:59,460
Scott: And so even before seeing the movie, I'm a little disappointed.

239
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:07,800
Scott: So for anyone out there who is like, you know, arguing that, oh, it didn't have to be a squid, something else works just as well, such and such.

240
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:11,679
Scott: I think you're wrong and I will argue it with you.

241
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,060
Scott: And I think I have made my point pretty clearly.

242
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,400
Scott: And if you haven't read Call of Cthulhu and you have read Watchmen or, you know, you really you need to read both.

243
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,200
Scott: They're sort of you know, they go very, very nicely together.

244
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:26,140
Scott: And that's just about all I have to say about that.
