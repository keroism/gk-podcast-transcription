00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,313
Rym: Hey, it's Thursday December 30th 2010.

2
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,200
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:20,539
Rym: Tonight we have the incorrigible Luke Burrage to discuss with us the historicity of the Bible.

4
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:24,778
Guest: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:34,514
Rym: So I know we were supposed to do a Wednesday show this week But we were lazy and we've got some four hours of Luke writing into a microphone.

6
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:38,770
Rym: so rather than do a normal show We're just gonna put up some of that discussion.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,300
Rym: We had you might recall the previous episode on Spiritual experiences in a thea atheism a theology.

8
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:56,280
Rym: This is Luke ranting about a very specific problem that seems to come up more and more in At least among atheist speakers where they'll concede a lot of ground that at least in Luke's mind should not be conceded.

9
00:00:57,422 --> 00:01:01,157
Rym: We didn't really edit this so here it is in all its glory, and I hope you enjoy it.

10
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:05,319
Rym: We'll see you in 2011 if Scott keeps letting me say the year

11
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:20,100
Guest: Whenever Whenever I talk to people and this you know take it back to what we're talking about just before and I was at this this this conference last year and This atheist conference, and there's this one guy who was his weird speaker.

12
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,131
Guest: He was actually do you know the Cottingley fairies?

13
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:22,855
Guest: who the fair?

14
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:23,157
Guest: Yes?

15
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:23,499
Rym: Yes?

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,605
Scott: I know I say the Cottingley fairies.

17
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:30,460
Guest: is this woman who others woman these two little girls who decided to?

18
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:38,300
Guest: Cut out pictures of fairies and take photos of them and they fooled everyone into believing that fairies actually existed.

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,090
Guest: And you know really good photos.

20
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,817
Guest: I think one and darling yeah, yeah look at a moment line It's actually pretty cool.

21
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:50,679
Guest: And and they convinced loads of people and it was like it was one of those first big sort of like forgeries like photographic forgeries That people would investigate and work out how it is.

22
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,953
Scott: They just they just made like they just like to go out like to And they put him no cardboard cutouts from a book.

23
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:58,300
Rym: they and they put them on.

24
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:06,842
Guest: They were actually I think they they copied onto bits of paper Pictures from a book like like you know they traced them and then drew them themselves And then put them.

25
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:10,564
Guest: but because they were a bit blurry because they were fluttering in the wind in the old like long Exposions.

26
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:12,900
Guest: they looked they looked a bit weird anyway.

27
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,997
Guest: So the son of the one of the girls who did that was then was telling that stuff.

28
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:18,920
Scott: so the people did this work.

29
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:19,754
Scott: We're in little kids.

30
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:22,466
Guest: They were They were like 12 and 16 or so.

31
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,870
Guest: they fooled everyone.

32
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,917
Scott: they kept the secret for a long time now.

33
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:26,860
Guest: No they're dead now.

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,200
Guest: One of them yeah the son of one of them was at this conference And he did this bit, and it was a quite interesting.

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:40,805
Guest: But then he got offered to this weird tangent and people started asking him his opinion of some of the world From an atheist point of view.

36
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:47,427
Guest: and I thought it was suddenly this this this talk went into a into into a weird direction Because there was somebody talking about.

37
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:56,476
Guest: he was talking about Moses, and this really surprised me as an He's an atheist But he was talking about Moses as though Moses existed.

38
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:02,540
Guest: and for me Who am a bit of a history nerd and once you know once I actually stopped being a Christian?

39
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:03,599
Guest: I actually looked up.

40
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,183
Guest: I was like okay So what is actually real?

41
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:12,028
Guest: and I worked out that pretty much all of the Old Testament up until about 400 years BC Is all bullshit.

42
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:13,537
Rym: Yeah, yeah, there were like 10 to know.

43
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:16,746
Rym: this is that Commoginated together could be the crazy thing?

44
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:19,474
Guest: no not even that not even that there isn't any figures.

45
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:24,049
Guest: the whole you know people always talk About like this Moses was this figure and this figure.

46
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:24,933
Guest: so no it wasn't.

47
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:25,695
Guest: it's bullshit.

48
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:26,498
Guest: It's all a legend.

49
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:36,718
Guest: There's Absolutely zero evidence for anything that's in the Bible up until about that the reign of Josiah Which is like you know four or five hundred years BC.

50
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:36,920
Scott: Yes?

51
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,775
Scott: Yeah, I used to I used to think even up until really recently.

52
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,732
Scott: I'm like you know oh, yeah There was a King David.

53
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:48,324
Scott: You know because There's no evidence there was Not even close.

54
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:50,110
Scott: there wasn't a King Solomon there wasn't anything.

55
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,631
Guest: there wasn't.

56
00:03:50,852 --> 00:04:04,660
Guest: and this is a thing people and this is what really annoys Me about these about atheists this these days not just atheists But the whole level of discussion when discussing things with religious people or with people who are wanting to talk about.

57
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:09,780
Guest: You know religions place in the world and the history of this and the history of that is that?

58
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:20,440
Guest: Any atheist who gets into this conversation about history Seeds all this ground to the to the religious people and doesn't even consider is there is a guy.

59
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,589
Scott: I forget his name.

60
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,020
Scott: I could find you the book as I have.

61
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,730
Scott: Yeah, this care a million fact right this guy.

62
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,191
Scott: He yet does.

63
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:29,017
Scott: he has a two-part Google video.

64
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:29,880
Scott: You can watch.

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,225
Scott: I'm sure it's what's his name.

66
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:32,169
Scott: I can't remember.

67
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,036
Scott: it might be he's Hispanic.

68
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:34,980
Scott: I think might be DeSouza.

69
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:35,503
Scott: I don't know.

70
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:36,427
Scott: okay.

71
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:38,960
Scott: I'll give I'll post it in whatever links or whatever.

72
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,936
Scott: I'll tell you after when I can get a computer right, but basically he wrote.

73
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:44,122
Scott: He's a biblical Scholar.

74
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:55,393
Scott: yeah, he studied the Bible, and he will tell you you know he has a two-part Google video And in the first part he basically does a lecture and the second party answers questions Yeah, and he basically says look there's no evidence for any of this.

75
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:58,847
Scott: in fact the oldest New Testament We have is from the Middle Ages.

76
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:03,980
Scott: Yeah, right these like none of this is you know he's like And he has a book called the end of biblical.

77
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:07,720
Scott: That's the book that he wrote.

78
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:10,685
Scott: It'll explain to you.

79
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:11,628
Scott: all of you know these.

80
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:15,522
Scott: this is the evidence we have like the Dead Sea Scrolls the oldest thing We've got.

81
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,545
Scott: yada yada yada.

82
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:18,331
Scott: You know Hector.

83
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,735
Scott: It doesn't give you his last name.

84
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:20,417
Scott: It is Hector.

85
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:22,620
Scott: Whoever it is something.

86
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:30,968
Guest: Yeah that kind of thing is.

87
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,520
Guest: now I really enjoy reading the Bible especially you know.

88
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,658
Rym: See I just read I find it very dry.

89
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:41,953
Scott: no I just read the book of Genesis illustrated by our crumb.

90
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:46,412
Scott: that is pretty awesome because You can see you know he all he.

91
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:56,270
Scott: it's a straight illustration job even though It's our crumb right and it's in his drawing style because he drew it, but he says straight up look I'm not trying to be stupid here or make jokes.

92
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:59,040
Scott: I'm attempting to just illustrate the book of Genesis.

93
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:01,220
Scott: I'm not doing any not changing anything.

94
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,520
Scott: You know you're here are the people I got my translations from because in English right yeah.

95
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:10,096
Scott: And it's great because you can see just how stupid some of the stuff is like.

96
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,466
Scott: at one chapter There's like a random chapter.

97
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,440
Scott: first of all you see that there's two Genesis stories, right?

98
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,103
Scott: It's like okay.

99
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:19,200
Scott: God created the world and then chapter two so God created the world.

100
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:20,529
Scott: It's like wait what?

101
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:21,837
Scott: and that the great?

102
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:31,971
Scott: the part That's like stands out the most to me after reading it is they tell this story about like someone who brought someone's sister And lied and said it was someone else.

103
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:34,180
Guest: and then that happens three times.

104
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,440
Scott: I tell it the same story again with the characters names change.

105
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:41,559
Scott: I'm like who wrote this book even if they're just making it up a work of fiction.

106
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,500
Guest: the way It works is that you've got in the bug in this and it comes at it.

107
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,273
Scott: It's such a non sequitur chapter - every time it appears.

108
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:47,655
Scott: exactly.

109
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:49,940
Guest: let me put it this way This is the way to explain it.

110
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,554
Guest: There's actually the things thing called the documentary hypothesis Which is where that Genesis and actually all the Torah is.

111
00:06:56,794 --> 00:07:01,313
Guest: it's pretty much four different documents Which have been spliced together, but each of those is fine.

112
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:01,835
Guest: Well.

113
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:02,317
Guest: There's more.

114
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:02,900
Guest: There's more of them.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,830
Guest: There's there's but there's the main four.

116
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,463
Guest: you know those the apocryphal text yeah Yeah, but there's.

117
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:09,290
Guest: and there's other bits of historical text in there.

118
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:14,692
Guest: now if you really want to read a good book, which is the the history of the Bible explained I think it's.

119
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:21,576
Guest: and the other one is and the The the Bible with sources revealed both by Richard E. Friedman.

120
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:22,098
Guest: I think it is.

121
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:32,760
Guest: I'm Amazon in as furiously as I can I'm recommending weird fucking typing type in the Bible with sources revealed, okay?

122
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:42,635
Guest: and So this book it actually goes through and it says this is what this is and they can work it all out by the different Uses of the names of God and there's like loads and loads of different things.

123
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:43,380
Guest: What's the name of the guy?

124
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:46,353
Rym: Oh, it is Richard Elliott Friedman.

125
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:47,640
Guest: Yes, Richard Elliott Friedman.

126
00:07:47,921 --> 00:08:00,140
Guest: So this book is amazing to read because you can you can actually read the different four documents in different orders like you can go And just read the J text and you can go through and read the E text and you can go through and read the D Text and you know and there's these different texts that you can go through.

127
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:05,000
Scott: It's like you've got math, but if you just stick to one text it makes sense on its own.

128
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,821
Scott: Yes, but when you mix them together it makes it makes That.

129
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:11,149
Guest: you're saying that's repeated where it's it's.

130
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,080
Scott: it's a story that appears in all the three texts slightly differently.

131
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:16,980
Scott: Yeah, but when they mix them together now the story is in there four times.

132
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:27,968
Guest: They didn't pick one and okay in in the one of the best bits of this book is where they talk about the the Noah's flood, okay So how many days did it rain?

133
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,760
Guest: and you've got three different accounts of Noah's flood being spliced together.

134
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:33,528
Guest: And that's why at the end of it.

135
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:36,119
Guest: They release a dove and they release.

136
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:37,799
Guest: What else do they release?

137
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:39,924
Guest: Raven.

138
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:41,150
Guest: they release a raven and a crow.

139
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:47,240
Guest: now in two different books There's a. there's a raven and a dove is released, but they would never do it twice.

140
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:48,575
Guest: But they have to put it in twice.

141
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:54,460
Guest: now The stories that you mentioned before they could put in three times and just change the names at the end of the flood story.

142
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:04,900
Guest: the whole point of the flood story is God wipes out the Wipes out the the earth and then says I'm never gonna do this again, so they can't put that story in twice.

143
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:11,759
Guest: So then just imagine the Bible being combined with another book where a great flood happens say the epic of Gilgamesh.

144
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,976
Guest: They can't have another to another flood in there because God said he'd only ever do that once.

145
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:16,820
Guest: then they'd have to put in.

146
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,020
Scott: Why don't they just remove the sentence where he said he'd only do it once?

147
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,050
Guest: These guys are not that bright.

148
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,760
Guest: That's the whole point of the story.

149
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:28,080
Guest: He wiped out humanity and then was gonna give them a second chance was never gonna do it again.

150
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,365
Guest: That's the whole point of the story now.

151
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,880
Scott: Just imagine this you guys who mix these texts together did not do a good job.

152
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,060
Scott: They were not intelligent.

153
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:41,006
Guest: The point is they weren't expecting that a few thousand years later that many people gonna read it because these were just texts that were Read out in the Bible.

154
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:51,079
Guest: No, not in about in the in the by the priests and it was Time of history where no almost nobody was reading especially nobody from the other side like no atheists were reading.

155
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,144
Rym: go These were all.

156
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:58,307
Rym: there were Gnostic sects a lot of them to the notes is the idea that there is secret knowledge that we will Reveal to you.

157
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:58,549
Scott: Yeah.

158
00:09:58,569 --> 00:09:59,174
Guest: Well, that's a bit later.

159
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,583
Guest: That's a bit later.

160
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:06,812
Guest: these books are in but the way that explain how the Bible was put together is Think that you've got Matthew Mark Luke and John.

161
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,380
Guest: Okay, all of them have got different texts.

162
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:17,254
Guest: I mean actually within within Matthew Mark Luke and John there's different, you know Documentary hypothesis of you know with source material and stuff from like and they do have some stories in common.

163
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:21,669
Guest: now just imagine That there were better writers though than the.

164
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:21,970
Scott: yeah.

165
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,660
Guest: Yeah, but it's it's more modern writers.

166
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:44,140
Guest: They rely on like the Greek novel tradition to actually like have structure to their stories rather than like the old epic Structures from like Mesopotamia, you know, there's different literary style, you know, if you read acts, you know Read the stories of Paul and then read like the Odyssey and you're like, hey, wait a second They're ripping loads of stuff on here in the Bible.

167
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,088
Guest: The end of the end of the Odyssey.

168
00:10:52,128 --> 00:10:52,650
Guest: what happens?

169
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:56,162
Guest: you get shipwrecked and ends up in Malta and this is the last thing he does.

170
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:59,963
Guest: at the end of literally the last chapter of of acts.

171
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:03,616
Guest: Paul gets shipwrecked gets swept up a Malta and then goes on to his final.

172
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:05,904
Guest: and you're just looking at going Wait a second.

173
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:10,960
Guest: the people reading this like who would been steeped in this Greek tradition and all the Greek classics.

174
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:14,471
Guest: It's like that would have just burst out off the page at them

175
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:15,455
Rym: as a purely

176
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:24,636
Guest: literary device, you know They would have got so much more out of it because they'd have known all the Greek traditions way more than anybody in a church These days would ever pick up on

177
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:24,778
Scott: that.

178
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:31,020
Scott: Okay So are you saying that the books that we're writing today that are just full of pop culture references a hundred thousand years from now?

179
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:37,572
Scott: If someone reads it like 10,000 years from now like a book that was written today Are they gonna think that it was true?

180
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:41,594
Scott: because they don't realize that those are Clearly the people the Beatles or whatever it is.

181
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:42,820
Rym: They worshiped the Bieber.

182
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,387
Guest: Yeah, well, it's not that but it's just it's.

183
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:49,523
Rym: and then they'll conflate the Bieber and leave it to beaver and you've got these two Figures.

184
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:50,630
Guest: and well, it's not that.

185
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:59,940
Guest: what I'm saying about the documentary hypothesis Is that all of the books of the like all of the Gospels like mark was written You know first and then there was Matthew and Luke but they were written for different reasons.

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,580
Guest: You know Matthew was very much a. yeah, okay We're the Jews we're gonna hang out together and we're the new Jewish sick Christian sect and Luke is about lot more.

187
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:10,482
Guest: Hey, we're all Greeks and anyone can become you know A Christian.

188
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:13,718
Guest: and then John is way off in the fairyland and he doesn't you know.

189
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:16,658
Guest: in John It's sort of like he pretty much rewrites the whole history of Jesus.

190
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:23,160
Guest: now Just imagine someone compiling these four books into one document and this is actually what you have with modern retelling.

191
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,231
Scott: But in the New Testament, don't they just put them one after the other?

192
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:28,640
Scott: they don't actually mix them together like the Old Testament.

193
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:36,245
Guest: But in the Old Testament the the priests would have had this one text the southern priests had one text and then the northern priests from the northern kingdom.

194
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:44,419
Guest: because there was you know two kingdoms there was Judah in the south and the Israel in the north and They had the same founding legends and they had a lot of the same stories, you know.

195
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:47,074
Guest: And that's what if you read Kings and Chronicles.

196
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,480
Guest: it retails the similar stories But from different points of view and judges has lots of judges.

197
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:52,349
Guest: It's like the story of judges.

198
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,440
Guest: all of that time should have fit into what it's sort of like.

199
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:57,058
Scott: It's got John Marshall and what.

200
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:10,060
Guest: And if you count up all of the stories and all of the people who do that There's no way that they could have all fitted into that one legendary period because they'd have been tripping over each other.

201
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:10,550
Guest: They'd have been.

202
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:15,660
Guest: you know Israel would have been invaded so many times and repelled so many times by these judges that it wouldn't work out.

203
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:23,380
Guest: It's because they've collected different legends from all over, you know ancient Palestine, you know ancient Judah and Israel and collect them all into one place.

204
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:39,000
Guest: From a literary point of view from a like source critical point of view this stuff to me is Fascinating because if you want you actually get in there and work out just say, okay It's all legend, but the legends themselves have history the legends themselves have legs.

205
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:43,040
Guest: You can read through all of these different things and tease out the truth.

206
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,780
Guest: Well, not the truth, but you can tease out the roots.

207
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,211
Guest: You can say this was a legend from that culture and this was a legend from that culture And this was a legend from that culture as you can tell.

208
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:58,176
Guest: I'm really enthusiastic about this But from a purely historical literary critical point of view and I find it fascinating.

209
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:03,818
Guest: well, that's the So this is a thing so many other people say.

210
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:09,600
Guest: oh So yeah, of course God doesn't exist which means that could have never been Noah's flood.

211
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:11,457
Guest: However, there could have been.

212
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:18,380
Guest: you know The Black Sea was blocked off at one point in the end of and I just saw another one of those the other day Like how the Reds he could have parted.

213
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:21,660
Guest: Bullshit nothing about it is true.

214
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,215
Guest: There's no reason to ever work out what Noah's flood could have been because Noah's flood is a myth.

215
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:28,860
Rym: Noah's flood was a story.

216
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,476
Scott: Yeah, no one's trying to work out where the Cyclops is hiding.

217
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:32,140
Rym: That's the thing.

218
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,120
Rym: No, well people are and people are looking for Bigfoot and they are looking for the lock desk.

219
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:41,485
Guest: No, but I mean they're not looking at other fictional Nobody nobody goes.

220
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:45,460
Guest: Where was where was this event in the Odyssey played out?

221
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:48,120
Guest: It tells you because it says it happened on this island.

222
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,995
Scott: No, but sometimes, you know, where were the sirens?

223
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:51,800
Scott: they were just in the sea.

224
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,994
Scott: They know which see they don't know what actually to be.

225
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:55,282
Guest: the thing is There is.

226
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:58,400
Guest: they normally named islands and you can actually go to those islands.

227
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:03,495
Guest: I've been to Greece a lot and they're all like oh, yeah This is where this happened in the Odyssey and this is the entrance to Hades.

228
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,219
Guest: This is the River Styx.

229
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,205
Guest: You know that kind of thing.

230
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:06,070
Guest: It does happen.

231
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,398
Scott: It's actually the River Styx, huh?

232
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:10,727
Guest: I've driven across it.

233
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,580
Scott: Well, it's just got a bridge.

234
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:19,059
Rym: Yeah, um, well the archaeology there there was a much more contiguous, you know people, you know pacing things.

235
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,712
Scott: Yeah I mean, I should go there I should go there with a ferry and a little and a little a little.

236
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:24,761
Scott: you know a little stick and then you know Where.

237
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:25,867
Guest: no it's the River Styx.

238
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:26,912
Guest: you can go with the barge pole.

239
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:27,394
Guest: is that you say?

240
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:27,957
Guest: Yeah, right.

241
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:28,660
Scott: That's I guess, you know.

242
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:35,243
Guest: Okay So the point is that everybody all these atheists and everybody just assumes that Jesus existed.

243
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:38,557
Scott: now a lot of I think I don't think a lot of people I think

244
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:39,180
Rym: a lot of people know

245
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:52,676
Guest: But I have met very very very very few people who if you say to them look there's actually no evidence that Jesus exists They don't buy it They say that there must be because they've been brought up all their lives in Jesus.

246
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:53,500
Guest: for so many people

247
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:01,464
Rym: Absolute like super yes, just they just like yeah Jesus and There is no evidence from the

248
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:14,300
Guest: time until 120 years later when there was actually a first mention that someone called Jesus who wasn't a mythical figure because you know There are either his mentions is of someone called Jesus.

249
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,802
Guest: I mean, it's a bit.

250
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:25,660
Guest: it's a bit, you know weird that the the name of Jesus actually just means like Savior from Yahweh say Jehovah Savior is actually what his name means, you know, so it's a bit weird.

251
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,700
Guest: I mean it was a name that lots of people had at the time because it was it was a cool still have that name.

252
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:31,592
Guest: Company has that name.

253
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:32,219
Guest: He's called Jesus.

254
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,230
Guest: Yeah, so the point is is that there's no evidence.

255
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:43,460
Guest: and the effort the first evidence that we do have I'm saying outside of the Bible which you can't take it as evidence because it wasn't written as evidence.

256
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:51,072
Guest: It was written as a as a sort of like a text like a spiritual document Like from a mystery religion in that kind of way.

257
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:53,687
Guest: and you know, there's Gnostics roots in it There's loads of different roots in it.

258
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,820
Guest: However, you can't take that as historical.

259
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,974
Guest: You can't take any of the Bible historical because it wasn't written as a history.

260
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:01,920
Guest: It wasn't even written as a legend.

261
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,607
Guest: It was written as a spirit.

262
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,417
Guest: It was written as a text to be read out in a really it's

263
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:18,718
Scott: funny though It's like even if you look at other Histories right things that were written as history is like well like Xenophon or whatever I any of those things and even though those were written as histories even those are loaded with all kinds

264
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:25,128
Guest: of bullshit Like the earliest history isn't?

265
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,160
Guest: they didn't even have a constant and even their author.

266
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:34,380
Scott: I can't even have the number of histories that are like, okay, maybe some of this was true But it was written by a guy paid by the king.

267
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:38,136
Scott: So everything is in favor of the guy who was in charge of that time.

268
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:43,887
Guest: even in that way You can pretty much work out that the king who paid for the history to be written Probably existed.

269
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:47,644
Guest: the thing is we have nothing like that in the Bible Absolutely, nothing like that.

270
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:56,180
Guest: all of the texts that were written by like say Paul which were you know, the if Paul existed You know because there's I mean he would have existed as some kind of figure, you know.

271
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,454
Guest: But even his name is a bit weird, you know, but there's lots of different, you know Theories about who wrote this book who wrote that book who wrote this book.

272
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:08,600
Guest: by reading them You can see that there's loads of people have been reading some of them like in Romans.

273
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:21,623
Guest: But read Romans 6 7 & 8 and there's like four different viewpoints being put forward in this one letter That was presumably written by one person and it was never a letter because people never used to write that letters that wrong.

274
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:27,930
Guest: what you have is one person saying this is what I think the salvation means and somebody else goes ah Well, I think it should mean this.

275
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:30,968
Guest: and in the next one someone goes Oh, wouldn't it be strange if it meant this?

276
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:38,340
Guest: and you're reading it and only from a critical point of view Can you read it and it makes sense if you try and make it sense from a spiritual point of view or theoretic not?

277
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,340
Guest: Not theoretical and from a theological point of view it can't make sense.

278
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,580
Guest: And that's what the Christian faith has been listing the knickers in a in a mess.

279
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,344
Scott: Well know what they did?

280
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:48,920
Scott: was they had all those conventions where they decided right?

281
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:53,447
Guest: That was way after any of that.

282
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:53,990
Guest: well not every.

283
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,637
Guest: all of this stuff was written because there's a lot of stuff which is written Very very late, you know.

284
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:10,820
Guest: But even the earliest date for the earliest date anyone could ever say that mark could have been written is after the fall of Jerusalem, you know, so it'd have been after like 70 AD say like 80 AD or something like that.

285
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,200
Guest: Yes way back last I mean, but that's a long time after Jesus is said to have died.

286
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:19,432
Guest: But even then if you look at it How do we know how old Jesus dar was when he died?

287
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:21,800
Guest: because none of the historical figures match up.

288
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,620
Guest: We don't actually know his age.

289
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,621
Guest: The only way they infer it is by how many times he went to the temple in Jerusalem after he turned 30.

290
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:29,968
Scott: Speaking of the temple in Jerusalem, right?

291
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:43,160
Rym: The fact that the Romans There's a lot of archaeological evidence and writings of the Romans and how this happened in this happen in this happen And they never really mentioned this Jesus guide.

292
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,979
Rym: All I mentioned are a couple of Jewish revolts that they put down.

293
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:49,857
Guest: There are people mentioned in the New Testament who did exist.

294
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:55,309
Guest: some of the you know People John the Baptist probably existed.

295
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,980
Rym: people argue with me will use things like that and say see it's historical.

296
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:00,445
Guest: No, you can't do it.

297
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,340
Guest: Probably the brother of Jesus or the the person who was called the brother of Jesus James.

298
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:06,800
Guest: He probably existed because he's mentioned in other places.

299
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:18,820
Guest: So now you're saying okay John the Baptist Jesus's cousin probably existed or someone of that name James the just who is called, you know, who is as portrayed as Jesus brother in the New Testament.

300
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:23,191
Guest: That way he is a historical figure all the best we can tell.

301
00:20:23,552 --> 00:20:25,477
Guest: but Jesus is never mentioned until 120 years later.

302
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:33,552
Guest: you're like wait a second and then you realize that if you look at it from it like a Historical point of view like with the growth of the early church.

303
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:40,984
Guest: There was a cult of John the Baptist There was a cult of James the just and there was a cult of Jesus and the Jesus cult was growing and they were just Like.

304
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:41,515
Guest: oh, didn't you know?

305
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,676
Guest: Check it out guys John the Baptist Jesus cousin and they're like He was teaching the same kind of thing.

306
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:48,200
Guest: look at this.

307
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,185
Guest: He actually said, you know, John the Baptist baptized Jesus and said yeah You're the guy that we were waiting for.

308
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:56,178
Guest: no great and they can join together and it was a way to grow.

309
00:20:56,198 --> 00:21:04,280
Guest: the church is because it'll have a diminishing cult in one area of the James the just call and a diminishing cult of John the Baptist and they Actually get together and they join in their little things.

310
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:18,923
Guest: That's why the like the you've got the immaculate conception story, which is pretty much like repeated for James Repeated for Mary the son or no the mother of Jesus and Mary who's Mary's sister.

311
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:20,149
Guest: I can't work it out how it works out.

312
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:26,831
Guest: But also John the Baptist has his own like Narrative nativity story in a way that's been put in.

313
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:29,120
Guest: I can't remember which of the Gospels it's in but it's right there.

314
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:35,080
Guest: and you're like, this is obviously another cult leader or another Figure at the time who was there.

315
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:45,475
Guest: So even if someone like Jesus did exist He was less important to everybody else at the time that none of the writings that we have now could have possibly been about him.

316
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:58,460
Guest: because it because he started off as if you read the the the the epistles of Paul and they stuff he's Obviously spiritual figure first and then he was you know made into a real person, you know.

317
00:21:58,521 --> 00:22:11,325
Guest: He was obviously like a legendary thing like if you read any of the stuff in any of the epistles like any of the like the earlier epistles that you can actually Say are earlier rather than having gross historical inaccuracies in it It's like you can look at it and go.

318
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:14,656
Guest: well that is it never even said that he.

319
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:18,735
Guest: he walked, you know And there's all these different stories and you just look at it and go.

320
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:19,680
Guest: this is not real.

321
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:23,420
Guest: Nothing in here is real and yet so many people just give it away.

322
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:26,031
Guest: They just leave the ground and just say everything.

323
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,160
Guest: that there was this guy called Jesus and he wasn't a great guy.

324
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:31,735
Guest: And I know some really staunch atheists who just presume Jesus was a great guy.

325
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:32,860
Guest: They say oh, yeah is a good guy.

326
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:34,407
Guest: He was probably some peace activist.

327
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:36,275
Guest: Hey, there's nothing like that in the Bible.

328
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:45,415
Guest: him saying he's a peace activist It's just they're reading into it were there like new they take all Those poor bankers and threw him out of the temple was up with that.

329
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:46,360
Scott: I mean to go back.

330
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:48,199
Scott: I want to talk about the temple of Jerusalem, right?

331
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:57,152
Scott: Cuz I went there right and you know sure enough there was definitely at least one temple there because well part of it's still there And there's plenty of archaeological evidence.

332
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:58,180
Guest: It was two temples, right?

333
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,350
Scott: Well, I mean that's the thing.

334
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:00,280
Scott: is they tell you right?

335
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,773
Scott: This is the second one, but where is the evidence of the first one right?

336
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:05,119
Scott: Was there a first one, right?

337
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,120
Scott: The first one is supposedly built by King Solomon who did not exist.

338
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:12,655
Guest: No, no, there was three because there was one built by King Solomon knocked down.

339
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:13,720
Guest: There was another one, right?

340
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,480
Scott: But what did that one really exist or did?

341
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:22,182
Guest: then there was another temple which was built by someone like the rubable or So.

342
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:29,039
Guest: I can't remember his name now, but you know read about it in like Josiah, you know, like the the later prophets You know, you can read about it there.

343
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:31,007
Guest: Um, and that probably did exist.

344
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:31,830
Guest: and then it was destroyed.

345
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:38,660
Guest: and then Herod's temple which was actually built not long one That's actually that's the one that's the bits of remains of it there and then that was destroyed by the rest.

346
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,175
Scott: Another another thing is that even Herod's temple right which really exists.

347
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:43,220
Scott: the third one, right?

348
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,516
Scott: That there's a small piece of still standing and there's plenty of archaeological bits remaining.

349
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:47,616
Scott: Yeah.

350
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:48,560
Guest: Yeah that existed.

351
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:53,556
Scott: If you go right I went to this place where they had basically it's like a little tourist attraction.

352
00:23:53,636 --> 00:24:11,220
Scott: They had a miniature Recreation of the whole thing as if it was never knocked down Yeah, and they basically it's like here's like a miniature place that it's like a model train set of old of old Jerusalem Right, and they're like, yeah see that little tiny tiny thing right in that corner, right?

353
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:19,123
Scott: Yeah the the piece of the wall that's still standing is like the minor retaining wall like a section of it and I'm like Really?

354
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:20,671
Scott: It was that big.

355
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,640
Scott: Yeah bigger than like all of Manhattan.

356
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:30,491
Scott: Yeah, there is no way that Herod built a temple in those days That was bigger than like all the pyramids and all the whatever.

357
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:45,900
Scott: and not only did they achieve that great feat of engineering But somebody else managed to knock down the whole thing except for this one tiny wall in Jerusalem the most defensible land in the world before they had any modern military technology whatsoever.

358
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,569
Guest: You go to Jerusalem and you're thinking wait a second.

359
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:50,796
Guest: I'm the Romans right breaking in here.

360
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:51,659
Guest: You're looking at me going.

361
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:59,759
Guest: no Thing is that if they say that's a third temple the temple that they should have built in Solomon's time would have been.

362
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:02,268
Guest: It would have been like literally like you say.

363
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:04,717
Guest: it's a rival like the hanging out on the Babylon.

364
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:07,754
Scott: Yes I mean the Parthenon is still standing.

365
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:18,210
Guest: So whatever temple If you go to the Parthenon You can actually look up at the walls and you can see the remains of previous temples actually built into those walls Which is really impressive.

366
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,979
Guest: like old columns.

367
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:24,206
Guest: See that they've made the new walls the new walls which are like 2500 years old.

368
00:25:24,326 --> 00:25:28,740
Guest: Yeah, they may remade these new worlds out of the ruins of the old temples.

369
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:32,346
Guest: And it's amazing that you say this is an old temple But there was another temple before that.

370
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:48,720
Guest: so there can be more than one temple on one side and more than one building on one Site, but if that site actually had been built like it's mentioned in the Bible like described in the Bible That would have been the focal point of the entire world like Babylon was you know?

371
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:53,802
Guest: These walls of Babylon also probably still be around a lot better than it was It was.

372
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:56,599
Guest: you know, they say that the Romans did a big good job of destroying it.

373
00:25:57,242 --> 00:26:01,989
Guest: I'm just saying that all of the stuff that's written about in the Bible This is this.

374
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:10,820
Guest: it's not so much my theory But the idea is that the Bible was actually collected into a into a collection of myths and probably by the guy Ezra Who's mentioned in the Bible?

375
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,239
Guest: He was the one who redacted all of the Bible into sort of like the story the narrative that we know it now.

376
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:19,060
Scott: He took out all the scary shit like the demons.

377
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:20,860
Guest: That's all still in there.

378
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,578
Guest: There's still lots of God action and angel action and smiting and stuff like.

379
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:25,000
Scott: no no no.

380
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,884
Scott: But this guy's you know.

381
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:31,400
Scott: if you the apocryphal stuff you got shit like like Moloch and like so sorts of Lovecraftian stuff.

382
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:33,184
Guest: There's all kinds of gods in there.

383
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:33,465
Guest: that was.

384
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:37,940
Guest: the point is they wanted to have a unified history for a single.

385
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:40,312
Guest: You know this they'd been invaded twice already.

386
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:49,060
Guest: You know the Assyrians come down and then And they wanted to have they wanted to have a unified history of the people who live there.

387
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:53,860
Guest: And he created not just him, but you know the priests at the time and they recreated a culture.

388
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,760
Guest: It was like a Renaissance made it up silent.

389
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:58,814
Guest: It's not all made up, but they took all the legends.

390
00:26:58,854 --> 00:26:59,035
Guest: Okay.

391
00:26:59,216 --> 00:26:59,800
Guest: What's your legend?

392
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,991
Guest: Oh, you had a guy called Abraham in your religion now.

393
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:02,172
Guest: Okay?

394
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:02,675
Guest: We'll have him.

395
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:03,500
Guest: who did you have?

396
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,771
Guest: Oh, you had a guy called David.

397
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:05,579
Guest: right we'll bring him in.

398
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:12,937
Guest: well I had the legend of Michael Jordan and the legend of Tiger Woods Combined all these things and that's like saying all those guys were you know Michael Jordan Tiger Wood.

399
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:17,859
Guest: they were brothers And they came from the same history and actually their son was David Beckham.

400
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:18,060
Guest: You know.

401
00:27:21,102 --> 00:27:24,236
Scott: And then two thousand years another go wait a minute Beckham was white.

402
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:25,120
Scott: these other guys.

403
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,123
Rym: Miracle miracle.

404
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:28,267
Scott: it's a miracle check.

405
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:31,780
Guest: this white baby was born of the white man the white the white baby.

406
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:33,176
Guest: That was the mark of Cain you know.

407
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:35,377
Guest: No, he was Esau the hairy guy.

408
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:40,220
Guest: no So what happened is that you have this this bringing together all these cultures into one culture.

409
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,398
Guest: And they needed this unifying document and for me That's amazing because it explained so much that they bring together all these different cultures.

410
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:49,479
Guest: now Here's the cool thing is that there's this theory.

411
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:49,761
Guest: well It's not.

412
00:27:49,781 --> 00:28:11,602
Guest: theory is actually written about at the time that when like the the Babylonians and the Assyrians And you know you know Darius and all these other people they would bring these people in and then move the people from one place to another and Then say we're moving you back to your ancestral homes and say work this ground We're.

413
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:22,294
Guest: this is really cool because we brought you back to your ancestral homes and now hang out here And this is your land and all these other people who around you This is your ancestral home, so don't worry about these other people and guess what.

414
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:24,240
Guest: they didn't take them back to their ancestral homes.

415
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:32,799
Guest: They just supplanted people from one place kept them in captivity for like ten years And then sent them off somewhere else or for a generation then sent them off somewhere else.

416
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:46,586
Guest: So there is a theory that all of the events that happened around about like pre four five hundred BC that are mentioned in the Bible never even took place in That you know in that area.

417
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:47,610
Guest: I mean some of them.

418
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:50,000
Guest: it probably did some of those fuckers because they did that.

419
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,276
Scott: They're still fucking us today.

420
00:28:54,864 --> 00:28:55,266
Rym: I read this.

421
00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:57,075
Rym: it was a sadly disappointing book.

422
00:28:57,115 --> 00:29:05,313
Rym: it claimed to Discuss the archaeology of the Persian side of the Peloponnesian Conflict and it had literally like two chapters on that.

423
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:12,000
Rym: then the rest was yes father But it talked a lot about that exact thing and like even the raising of the army from all different.

424
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,587
Guest: Yeah, you know you know the the whole.

425
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:17,146
Guest: you know when you know in the in the in the Battle of Thermopylae You know that kind of thing.

426
00:29:17,347 --> 00:29:19,320
Guest: they brought forward this army, and then they brought forward this.

427
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,953
Guest: I mean they different people from these different places.

428
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:21,840
Guest: when they went home.

429
00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:22,424
Guest: They didn't.

430
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:24,177
Guest: they didn't take these guys back to the land they went.

431
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,320
Guest: well Do you actually want to walk home, or do you just want this bit of ground over here that we conquered?

432
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,554
Guest: They're like oh, we'll have this.

433
00:29:28,574 --> 00:29:35,084
Rym: they're like okay And all the Persian kings would even go to the temples along the way and pray and be like look I am the safe.

434
00:29:35,124 --> 00:29:38,297
Rym: like they try to figure out what the Savior was of the area and be like I'm here.

435
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:43,126
Guest: yeah There's this whole history of these.

436
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:45,636
Guest: you know this Persian Empire and all these different empires from.

437
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:49,430
Guest: you know that cradle of Civilization would do this to all the little tribes around them like.

438
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:50,454
Guest: you know Judah was.

439
00:29:50,514 --> 00:29:53,048
Guest: it wasn't this massive nation with these old big temples and stuff like that.

440
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,459
Guest: and you know like the the walls of Jericho.

441
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,294
Guest: You know the whole story is bullshit.

442
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:00,200
Guest: You know there was never walls.

443
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:06,113
Guest: Jericho did exist at the time, but it didn't exist at the time.

444
00:30:06,193 --> 00:30:07,800
Guest: what they were said that they tore the gates down.

445
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,683
Guest: It's like Nazareth.

446
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:13,080
Guest: where Jesus comes from wasn't actually a town when Jesus was a boy.

447
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:18,019
Guest: You know it's one of those things that people don't even point out that the only reason Nazareth actually grew up as a town.

448
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,713
Guest: it Was a town in hit like before.

449
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:29,920
Guest: Jesus was around But there was nothing there when he was meant to live there, and it was only after like the the sacking of Jerusalem and that like the all the Jews being kicked out and it was decided that that was the place.

450
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:33,270
Guest: It's the same Jesus being called a rabbi.

451
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,300
Guest: there weren't rabbis at the time when Jesus around.

452
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,176
Guest: They were no priests because they went to the temple and they and he went into the the synagogue.

453
00:30:39,196 --> 00:30:40,020
Guest: there was no synagogues.

454
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,793
Guest: They had the temple in Jerusalem, and he was that.

455
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:44,160
Scott: so that's the thing that people don't know.

456
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,817
Scott: It's actually kind of like you know if you believe Judaism right.

457
00:30:47,917 --> 00:31:01,860
Scott: it's like Technically that the real temple the one that doesn't exist right now is like an incredibly magical place Where you place it can go you can go there, and you can sacrifice shit to God, and he will give you real fucking power.

458
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:09,600
Scott: It's like a fucking magic spell yeah, and because it's not there right now We can't do that, but we have to wait for the right time to build it again.

459
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,360
Scott: And in fact if you go there the only people who like we're the only Jews who actually think about this and know it.

460
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:18,763
Scott: It's sort of like the zenu of Judaism right?

461
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:23,637
Scott: the only people who are in on this are the Hasid's in Jerusalem who have you.

462
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:32,820
Scott: if you walk around In Jerusalem right you'll see things like a big golden menorah like a giant one in a glass case And they're like we're waiting to put this back in and you just go and look at it.

463
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,804
Scott: If you're a tourist you go.

464
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:34,105
Scott: Oh look.

465
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:34,688
Scott: That's nice.

466
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:36,997
Scott: You don't realize that that Kate like they're.

467
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:37,660
Scott: they're waiting.

468
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,289
Scott: That's for the temple the house.

469
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:40,415
Scott: these are waiting to use it.

470
00:31:40,536 --> 00:31:52,898
Scott: You know it's like This little hammer and a fire axe inside, that's what that is you know they're waiting to Sacrifice lambs and shit and get it on.

471
00:31:52,999 --> 00:32:01,919
Rym: well They're like a lot of the Orthodox Christians even parts of you know Catholicism where you know if this shit is real the way the Book says then why don't we just do this and do the thing that the book says yes?

472
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,300
Guest: Well, that's the whole thing at the end of the end of Indiana Jones isn't it where they go exactly?

473
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:12,046
Guest: We just need to make this tent with this these dimensions and walk through in this way and open it up in this way and God will turn up.

474
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:13,499
Guest: and then he fucking did which is awesome.

475
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:19,189
Guest: But the point is they follow the instructions and it works, and if it really did work It would be that cool.

476
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,959
Guest: so all of this different these different ideas.

477
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,425
Guest: now I'm not entirely convinced that that is actually you know the whole Replanting a different.

478
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,251
Guest: Yeah, I'm not convinced.

479
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:30,905
Guest: the sacrificing lambs in the temple I'm just going back from it.

480
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,713
Rym: It's got a sacrifice $5 bills to me.

481
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:42,454
Guest: I'm going back from a bit of the tangent when I was talking about like the the people who who were Settled again after you know the different exiles came back.

482
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,000
Guest: They came back and settled in that area.

483
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:55,500
Guest: I don't believe I from my own readings and my of history and actually my reading the text I think is it little bit too much site-specific to the places to the legends of you know these places because they're all going.

484
00:32:55,791 --> 00:33:02,844
Guest: Oh, yeah and Abraham went there and he said an altar there and then he went there and he said an altar there and then he Went there and then Jacob went to this place And he said of an altar there.

485
00:33:02,964 --> 00:33:08,300
Guest: and these are all like name-checking all of the people who lived in those places And like you know it's sort of like people in America.

486
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,873
Guest: So I'm like yeah George Washington went to this theater and this and then he was And then he lived here for a bit, and it's one of those kind of things it was.

487
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:18,327
Guest: it's like to make the people Stayed in this hotel room.

488
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:19,051
Scott: Yeah, it's that kind of.

489
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:25,700
Guest: therefore you should come to this hotel And that's why you know Abraham and Jacob and all these guys all these old patriarchs.

490
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,880
Guest: They all go from place to place and have their own little adventures in these different places.

491
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:32,696
Guest: They could have all just happened in one location and probably the original stories.

492
00:33:32,897 --> 00:33:33,700
Guest: that is what it happened.

493
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:38,016
Guest: But as these stores are passed around someone said hey, did you know actually Moses?

494
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:39,040
Guest: He was buried here?

495
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:48,000
Guest: The New York Rangers, they're actually from Detroit Maybe not, but this is where they won their game, and they may have had a big celebration here.

496
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,622
Guest: You know that kind of thing.

497
00:33:49,104 --> 00:33:57,080
Guest: so anyway to tie it all back to the thing that I wanted to talk about with this history And biblical history is that people have just got to get over it.

498
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,660
Guest: They've either got to have a standard like a scientific standard of history Which is very difficult to have by the way because there's always you can never be even recent history.

499
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:08,272
Guest: It's all over the place because you go okay, what actually happened.

500
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:10,139
Guest: You know 50 years ago, and people like.

501
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,072
Guest: So when you're dealing with history you're always always always dealing with probabilities.

502
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:21,168
Guest: now the probability that Jesus actually Existed and did anything at all pretty close to zero.

503
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:26,011
Guest: It's I would say I would say it's probably like a Three or four percent.

504
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:29,058
Guest: You know just off the top of my head, but it's It's out of a hundred.

505
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:45,520
Guest: It's probably four percent that the stories which the first stories that we get About Jesus may have been based on someone who might have actually existed And what I'm talking right back at the very beginning of the epistles the Paul's epistles because that's the first writings that we have about him.

506
00:34:45,902 --> 00:34:48,639
Guest: Anything after that is not based on a historical figure.

507
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,289
Guest: It's only based on the stories that are already being told about this figure Which isn't based in history.

508
00:34:54,530 --> 00:35:01,860
Guest: as soon as you have a mention of a character Nothing after that point you can you take back to a real person if you want.

509
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,923
Guest: Do you understand what I'm saying there?

510
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:08,979
Guest: like I come up with it with a with a historical figure and like Uncle Sam I'm just saying.

511
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,560
Guest: I'm just saying that you tell one story featuring someone called Uncle Sam.

512
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:19,820
Guest: Every story after that person after that point is not referencing the real Uncle Sam.

513
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:27,280
Guest: It's referencing the character of Uncle Sam and you can write anything that you want from that Ghost in the shell.

514
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:30,972
Guest: But it's the same with like all these different characters like.

515
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:39,740
Guest: there could have been someone called Odysseus But every time as soon as he was written about once You know everything after that was was based on the character that was written about the first time.

516
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,980
Scott: So so the first story was the real deal and everything else after.

517
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:48,760
Guest: Yeah, yeah, that could be it but it's bombed on to it and it becomes canon in a way exactly canon.

518
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,260
Guest: But there's loads and loads of stories that the infancy Gospels of Jesus where it's like.

519
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:56,647
Guest: It's like Dennis the Menace.

520
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,160
Guest: He's like killing people accidentally and then bringing them back to life.

521
00:35:59,361 --> 00:36:00,869
Scott: So the real Batman is.

522
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,920
Scott: the real Batman is all dorky, right?

523
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:11,647
Guest: I'm just saying that there's lots of histories of Jesus fictional histories of Jesus where he is the wonder kid Who's like, you know, like young Superman.

524
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:23,860
Guest: he it's literally young Superman because yeah walking on water making fish The infancy Gospels in the stories that they tell of his childhood where he's like taking the piss out of his parents and stuff like.

525
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,979
Guest: There's a little bit of it left in the Gospels, but any tiniest little bit there.

526
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:29,676
Guest: Um, but yeah, that was all there, but they've got honor.

527
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:30,200
Guest: that's not real.

528
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:47,045
Guest: But like you say as soon as their character exists You can't take anything from him written from the point of view of people who believe in that character and who actually mean something to them from a spiritual and Theological point of view that can't be taken and face value or anything spiritual or anything historical anymore.

529
00:36:47,387 --> 00:36:56,619
Guest: so the first mentions of Jesus that we have are Complete fictions like mark is definitely the first gospel that the earliest versions of mark that we have.

530
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:58,908
Guest: You know that the first I mean, there's.

531
00:36:58,948 --> 00:37:01,296
Guest: no now there's no nativity story there.

532
00:37:01,317 --> 00:37:02,963
Guest: It doesn't talk about anything It just talks about.

533
00:37:03,284 --> 00:37:07,860
Guest: it's like a collection of sayings which are from probably from this document called Q a few collections of miracles.

534
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:17,360
Guest: And then he dies and rises again, but then once he dies and rises again But then he doesn't even come come back and then there's no ascension into heaven, you know in the oldest versions of it.

535
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:24,319
Guest: So you even the earliest versions of the gospel stories like that are meant to be like this historical novel form about it.

536
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:30,360
Guest: Isn't even the story of Jesus that we know today with like angels singing in his birth and all this kind of stuff, you know?

537
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:44,298
Guest: and so it's really weird and I think that people should either have a historical view of Jesus or a mythical view of Jesus But never take the mythical view of Jesus and say there's a grain of history in it because there isn't.

538
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:50,540
Scott: yeah Personally I think of Jesus the same way I think of like somebody or whatever, you know or anything like that.

539
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,780
Guest: Now at the basis of legends there can be kernels of truth.

540
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:56,273
Guest: But the basis of yeah, they were Greeks.

541
00:37:56,293 --> 00:38:02,680
Scott: they lived at the bottom of mountains So they wrote about gods living on top exactly, you know, then there is some couldn't really go up there exactly.

542
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,236
Scott: They didn't have carabiners and ropes and that's myth.

543
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:05,800
Guest: That's myth.

544
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,371
Guest: Where is the legends of Greece like, you know, like Hercules.

545
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:15,300
Scott: legends are legends, you know myths are about, you know Like, you know things don't it, you know, like gods or whatever exactly.

546
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,520
Scott: I know legend is about like another person even if there might be a fictional person exactly.

547
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:23,699
Guest: but what I'm saying is that legends and myths they have they fulfill different functions.

548
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:34,460
Guest: and Because Jesus was either a myth, but he's turned into a mythical and not just mythical But also now a spiritual and theological person not historical.

549
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,707
Guest: So I think that we should always get away.

550
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:44,140
Guest: anytime anybody brings up a historical fact from the Bible You have to say it's pretty much a hundred percent.

551
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:50,240
Guest: We're pretty much hundred percent positive that nothing in the Bible is true Except a few things which are also mentioned elsewhere.

552
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:54,180
Rym: With that is that I agree and I do that all the time.

553
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:56,495
Guest: I can't do that all the time because it pisses people off.

554
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:57,300
Rym: Oh, see that's the thing.

555
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:03,160
Guest: However, we need to in the same we need to rate what's that Dawkins has raised people's consciousness.

556
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:09,980
Guest: Is that Jesus is a fictional character in the same way that all these other characters throughout history?

557
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,707
Guest: Fictional in the just legends.

558
00:39:12,747 --> 00:39:13,750
Guest: Yeah, we can say spider-man.

559
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,525
Guest: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of parallels between modern, you know modern Organic web shooters.

560
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,474
Scott: No, I'm just saying, you know fictional character.

561
00:39:21,515 --> 00:39:22,560
Scott: I wasn't trying to make an analogy.

562
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:23,828
Guest: No, no, but there are lots of.

563
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:28,420
Guest: I mean, I'm not into comic books and stuff But there is lots and lots of analogies in the development.

564
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:38,208
Scott: Well, I mean I could pick any random fictional character and relate them to any because I mean think about almost every like Like at least 50% of novels you read.

565
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:43,080
Scott: right there is a character who is a metaphor of Jesus, right you read like.

566
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,670
Scott: Yeah, I'm like Lord of the Flies.

567
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,232
Scott: There's the.

568
00:39:46,272 --> 00:39:47,900
Scott: there's the kid who's basically Jesus.

569
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:49,365
Scott: No, that's the nerd.

570
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:53,100
Scott: There's the other kid who's like the one who always takes fruit from the trees and gives it the show.

571
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:55,063
Guest: Yeah, yeah, yeah Jesus.

572
00:39:55,324 --> 00:40:00,400
Scott: right now how many how many animes or movies do you see where someone's on a cross at one point?

573
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,009
Guest: I'm not talking about the characters.

574
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,080
Guest: I'm talking about the development of characters.

575
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:13,309
Guest: You have in Mark in Matthew and Luke and John you've got four different Jesus's written by four different people and then people identify them as one guy.

576
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:15,043
Guest: it's like Superman.

577
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:19,979
Guest: when he first started off was this character and then people who wrote this radio play gave him a power of.

578
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:21,787
Guest: you know Cuz originally he jumped.

579
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:23,615
Guest: you can't know buying buying.

580
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,720
Guest: it sounds stupid on the radio.

581
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:30,420
Guest: So they had him fly and then another guy wrote in the character that you'd see through walls and this other guy wrote in.

582
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,600
Guest: That's what's happened to Jesus over the times.

583
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:45,996
Guest: He started off as this one guy who fulfilled one function with one in one mystery religion Which was an outgrowth of some Jewish text, you know, you can say that, you know with some influence from some Gnostics You know ideas put in there as well and he had one guy.

584
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:53,580
Guest: he was one guy He had one function in one story and then the ball began rolling and now he's this guy who does all these miracles.

585
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,665
Guest: He's got all these functions.

586
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:58,280
Guest: He's like he's he's got on earth, you know, even on the first in the first book He was God on earth.

587
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:03,642
Guest: but you know He became more of a man and then he goes back into more of a God in the same way that Superman is sometimes way More human.

588
00:41:03,682 --> 00:41:09,602
Guest: and then other times he's like like this powerful figure who just punches all the problems out of the way and nobody can Do him.

589
00:41:09,924 --> 00:41:17,840
Guest: and then you know, and there's this whole different things There's all these different functions with Jesus that have all been brought now into one narrative which at the beginning wasn't there.

590
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,924
Guest: Well, here is a quote.

591
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:22,760
Guest: if it was there people were more knowing about it, you know, it is a question, right?

592
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:30,160
Scott: So there's obviously this sort of you know Movement from polytheism right to monotheism, right?

593
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:36,180
Scott: But what was it about, you know taking all the legends and combining them, you know to make a monotheistic.

594
00:41:38,002 --> 00:41:40,148
Scott: Why was why was that more?

595
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:43,276
Scott: why does that appeal to more people then?

596
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:44,860
Rym: because the Romans did it.

597
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,685
Rym: We mentioned just before about the temple in Jerusalem.

598
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:56,278
Guest: That was the only place where you could in the end worship God.

599
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,623
Guest: now Why was that?

600
00:41:57,924 --> 00:41:59,430
Guest: was it because that was the only place.

601
00:41:59,731 --> 00:42:00,172
Guest: no wasn't.

602
00:42:00,212 --> 00:42:06,495
Guest: because it was because that's where the king was and that's where The priests were and they wanted to consolidate power and all income into one place.

603
00:42:06,977 --> 00:42:10,694
Guest: even in the Bible It talks about the different shrines to different gods.

604
00:42:10,754 --> 00:42:12,200
Guest: different, you know There's.

605
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:14,608
Guest: there's the the shrine of Asherah.

606
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:27,800
Scott: Asherah was the female counterpart a counterpart to Yahweh which was you know God they always talk about like oh you have your false idols or get your gods out of my house And they're always these different gods, you know smash your golden calf.

607
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,475
Guest: Whatever the way that they brought everything together there in.

608
00:42:31,556 --> 00:42:34,147
Guest: if you read in the Old Testament There was altars everywhere and they were reading.

609
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,332
Guest: and there was these people worshiping here.

610
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:39,231
Guest: and these people see people saying we should worship in The valleys and other people say no we should worship in the hills.

611
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:41,122
Guest: and other people say no we should worship by this Oasis.

612
00:42:41,303 --> 00:42:44,136
Guest: and other people say we should worship at the river and we should worship over here.

613
00:42:44,418 --> 00:42:45,523
Guest: and in the end They went right.

614
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:46,207
Guest: fuck all you guys.

615
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:46,709
Guest: what we're gonna do.

616
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,760
Guest: We're gonna worship here in Jerusalem.

617
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:52,376
Guest: This is you know, this is the financial center of the our kingdom.

618
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:53,360
Guest: This is the power center.

619
00:42:53,742 --> 00:42:57,240
Guest: Everybody has to come here once a year and this is where they're gonna get atoned.

620
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,852
Guest: This is where they have to give their sacrifice and that's where it comes from.

621
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:01,500
Scott: Muslims use that same strategy.

622
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,839
Guest: Yeah, that's not working - yeah, it works really well for them.

623
00:43:05,101 --> 00:43:06,185
Guest: Christians don't have that.

624
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:13,200
Guest: Well, I guess Rome has it in a way like with you know with the Well, there's the schism and that kind of stuff for them.

625
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:21,688
Guest: But I'm just saying even now people, you know It's still a place to go and all power resides in this one city One country in case.

626
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:30,565
Guest: so in the case of the Roman Catholic Church is the Vatican so having a single God which everybody has to worship and There's nobody else to worship.

627
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:36,487
Guest: So if they did have other shrines to other gods, it would be a bit stupid to say Oh, yeah, this is Yahweh is different.

628
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:37,952
Guest: This is his place and it.

629
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:40,440
Guest: but if you want to worship Ashera, it's okay.

630
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,500
Guest: You can go and do that at any willow tree I mean.

631
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:46,132
Guest: but that means you grow a willow tree in your back garden and you can keep.

632
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:51,459
Guest: you can sacrifice your Lamb in your back garden and then keep the meat and none of it.

633
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,269
Guest: None of your 10% tithe goes to the priests and stuff like that.

634
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,380
Guest: So there is a really good reason why it's monotheism.

635
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:58,889
Guest: Monotheism worked.

636
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:00,519
Guest: it's because it centralized all the power.

637
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,785
Scott: I mean, yeah, it worked it.

638
00:44:01,865 --> 00:44:03,311
Scott: it worked at centralizing the power.

639
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:04,335
Scott: But why is it more?

640
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,700
Scott: Why was it more popular, right?

641
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,142
Scott: You could choose.

642
00:44:06,162 --> 00:44:07,628
Rym: did the same thing to the Roman Empire.

643
00:44:10,662 --> 00:44:17,779
Rym: This is what I was getting at with the Roman example that basically people in power We're very we're actively using it for these purposes to centralize.

644
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:22,979
Scott: I mean Julian when he tried, you know, so because so because people who are already powerful used it.

645
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,088
Guest: They just force on everyone the people.

646
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:34,439
Rym: people wouldn't have chosen it over the other one for any particular One and different emperors and there were different movements to try to do the same thing with Roman paganism.

647
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:38,190
Guest: Either way, they were like, okay Jupiter's the main guy.

648
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,120
Guest: everyone come here to worship Jupiter and we're like, yeah, what about Mars?

649
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,163
Guest: Yeah, Mars is the.

650
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:43,148
Guest: he's the son of Jupiter.

651
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:44,373
Guest: Come on over here.

652
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:45,096
Guest: Jupiter's a great guy.

653
00:44:45,276 --> 00:44:45,558
Guest: They're going.

654
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:46,120
Guest: what's the use?

655
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,284
Guest: We're over here agree.

656
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:49,955
Guest: No, no, Jupiter is the new name for Zeus.

657
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:50,980
Guest: Come on over guys.

658
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:53,205
Guest: It's the same thing.

659
00:44:53,225 --> 00:44:54,048
Guest: It happens over and over.

660
00:44:54,309 --> 00:45:02,463
Guest: now if you want to take like the the natural selection and evolutionary view of historical historical view of the Evolution of religion.

661
00:45:02,805 --> 00:45:04,009
Guest: that was a long phrase.

662
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,970
Guest: if you look at religion as an evolutionary system They're not there to benefit people.

663
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,997
Guest: They're better there to benefit themselves.

664
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:12,218
Guest: Yep.

665
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:12,960
Rym: The self is gene.

666
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:19,105
Guest: Yeah, if they themselves have a gene which is beneficial to them They will thrive.

667
00:45:19,145 --> 00:45:25,367
Guest: now monotheism great gene you're gonna thrive, you know paying money to priests Best one if you an infidel.

668
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:38,760
Guest: Right, yeah, I mean if because if you get if you conquer a land and go right everyone here You have to be Muslim or else, you know, actually early Muslim wasn't quite early Islam wasn't quite like that.

669
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,844
Rym: Yeah, well look at the beauty of that.

670
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:42,696
Rym: Oh, those specific people right there are people of the book.

671
00:45:42,736 --> 00:45:43,499
Rym: We're cool with them.

672
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,543
Rym: Yeah, somewhat.

673
00:45:44,683 --> 00:45:44,864
Rym: Yep.

674
00:45:45,024 --> 00:45:47,392
Rym: So let's use them and then attack those bastards.

675
00:45:47,432 --> 00:45:47,633
Rym: Yeah.

676
00:45:47,673 --> 00:45:49,920
Guest: Yeah now also a great one.

677
00:45:50,241 --> 00:45:51,306
Guest: What if you're an apostate?

678
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:54,780
Scott: What if you leave the Islam faith in Afghanistan?

679
00:45:55,121 --> 00:46:03,389
Guest: You get stoned to death you get killed or you get you get put in prison and in the same Asylum, that's how powerful that gene is.

680
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,300
Guest: or that meme is or that evolutionary unit that is in Islam.

681
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:08,624
Guest: That's how powerful it is.

682
00:46:08,784 --> 00:46:14,260
Guest: And that's why Islam is very very strong because it's very self-serving and it will continue itself.

683
00:46:14,602 --> 00:46:17,060
Guest: Anyway, so I don't know how we got onto that, but I think we've gone on long enough.

684
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,589
Rym: I think that was a good one.

685
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:18,971
Rym: Okay.

686
00:46:19,011 --> 00:46:19,856
