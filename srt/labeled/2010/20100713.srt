1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,145
Rym: It's Tuesday July 13th.

2
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:12,668
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,480
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight a new game the legend of Zelda.

4
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:22,396
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,509
Rym: Sweet Jesus, we're back from ConnectiCon.

6
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:34,070
Rym: Yep, that was a. you know it's one thing to do like eight or nine panels at a con.

7
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:38,070
Rym: It's another thing to take over an entire panel room for an entire con.

8
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:42,409
Rym: It is yet another thing to be the heads of panels for an entire time.

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:50,578
Scott: Usually the heads of panels are don't actually do any panels so having to do panels and be the head of panels was quite Well actually wouldn't have been so bad.

10
00:00:50,618 --> 00:01:03,650
Rym: the only trouble we ran into which will be rectified for next year Is that we had to deal with all situations and be doing panels which meant I had an earpiece on while I was doing panels And periodically I would be interrupted and have to go respond to something.

11
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,897
Scott: Yeah, we got to do something about that.

12
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:06,660
Rym: already sorted that out.

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,730
Rym: We're getting operational head to handle that radio.

14
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:09,396
Rym: Yeah, we need.

19
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,928
Rym: Thursday is really the only place for it.

20
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,475
Scott: No, that's all right.

21
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:31,250

00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:39,266
Scott: What are the listeners gonna do?

27
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:42,594
Scott: There's no way.

28
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:44,662
Rym: I guess we'll have to wait at least a couple more Thursdays.

29
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:45,787
Scott: yeah one or two.

30
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:50,368
Rym: yep All right, you got anything anything fancy anything going on.

31
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:54,590
Scott: well I you know we go into ConnectiCon and I wasn't able to get laundry done before we went.

32
00:01:54,893 --> 00:02:01,270
Scott: So I was gonna do it last night Fascinating yeah, so I go down to do some laundry and I put in one of the laundry machines.

33
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,829
Rym: They have a screen that tells you this is really you're gonna keep going with this.

34
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:08,983
Scott: Yeah, okay They have a screen that tells you how much money you got to put in.

35
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:11,297
Scott: so I go to the first one and the screen Is off.

36
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:11,967
Scott: which is we?

37
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:17,385
Scott: So I put a money in and it says okay add another dollar.

38
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:23,202
Scott: so I put in a second money Nothing happens, and then it resets and is like yeah, give me a dollar 25.

39
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:27,928
Scott: I'm like what I'm like pushing the coin return nothing.

40
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,965
Scott: I Already put my clothes and detergent in there by the way all right so it was detergent.

41
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,250
Rym: because there's two situations.

42
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,562
Rym: Situation one you put the clothes in put the detergent in the top.

43
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:38,029
Rym: if you fail you pull the clothes out.

44
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,517
Rym: Situation to certain kinds of washers.

45
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,766
Rym: detergent is already leaking out of the clothes.

46
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:43,850
Scott: detergent is not leaking up.

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,517
Rym: It is past the point of no return.

48
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:46,943
Rym: you son are fucked.

49
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:48,470
Scott: now the detergent is not on the clothes.

50
00:02:48,672 --> 00:02:49,922
Rym: I did that once not that long ago.

51
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:53,154
Scott: So anyway I Know.

52
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:58,306
Scott: I go again and I go to the second washer which looks like it which the screen was on.

53
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,110
Scott: it was looking normal.

54
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:00,749
Scott: I put a quarter and nothing happens.

55
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:03,959
Scott: Like how could both washers be broken?

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,929
Scott: so I called the super today, and he said he was gonna fix the why.

57
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:12,482
Scott: you know Some of the guy was coming to fix the washers today, so I'll do laundry when I get home tonight, but Here's the thing that happened.

58
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,384
Scott: all right I bring the baskets back upstairs, and I just put them on the floor.

59
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:23,439
Scott: cuz I'm gonna drag them back downstairs You know as soon as they're fixed or maybe to a laundry batter who knows usually I'll just leave my stuff down in the laundry room.

60
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:26,775
Rym: if like all the washers are all being used yeah There's only two in my you know.

61
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,161
Scott: so I bring it back upstairs anyway.

62
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,470
Scott: You know I go to live in bed.

63
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,936
Scott: I'm reading some stuff.

64
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,000
Scott: You know I get up.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,888
Scott: I go to the bathroom, and I notice that the The detergent bottle is upside out in the laundry basket, so I'm like oh, I better turn it upside right.

66
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:44,429
Scott: you know It was not a complete disaster.

67
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:47,659
Scott: Cuz it is a big thing of detergent.

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,487
Scott: if the whole thing were to spill out.

69
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:50,129
Scott: It would be doom.

70
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:52,766
Rym: What's tough is what are you gonna clean that up with?

71
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:53,410
Rym: I mean water?

72
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,570
Scott: Yeah, there was basically like it was in the basket.

73
00:03:56,992 --> 00:04:00,832
Rym: I spilled a bit of detergent in the trunk of that Sun fire I used to have.

74
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:03,784
Rym: it was there until the day I got rid of that car.

75
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,295
Scott: It is basically a millimeter You know detergent.

76
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:08,962
Scott: It was only a little bit like less than a cup.

77
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:14,829
Scott: You know, but you know I I basically had to take all the clothes that got detergent on them out.

78
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:22,370
Scott: I put them in this I cleaned out the kitchen sink And then I pretty much watered them in the kitchen sink until they were detergent bliss.

79
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:33,278
Rym: I don't know if we've just been doing gig nights so long that it's just like a job or what but That was perhaps the most mundane Anecdote we have ever had on this show.

80
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:33,900
Scott: What's Monday?

81
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:34,784

Scott: it was crazy.

84
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:42,204
Rym: usually we got things like and it exploded or a hobo came in.

85
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:47,809
Scott: there was a hobo hanging out Hung up my show about living in the washer.

86
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:55,550
Scott: I hung them all up to dry in the in the bathroom And then I put the laundry basket in the sink to clean the detergent out of it.

87
00:04:56,871 --> 00:05:00,730
Scott: Still going yeah, and now I got to go home and see what the situation is.

88
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,405
Scott: Alright, I might be up like all night doing laundry.

89
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:05,753
Rym: I feel like now I got at least.

90
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,590
Rym: so I'll pull this out of the ConnectiCon show on Thursday.

91
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,177
Rym: I got an anecdote from ConnectiCon.

92
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,121
Rym: hopefully we'll bring this back.

93
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,129
Rym: laundry related not at all.

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:14,992
Scott: Mm-hmm.

111
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:27,870
Rym: but So what were you in the wrong room, yeah, I was in the wrong room.

112
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:34,406
Rym: I was in panel five and I should have been in workshop one Workshop one or two or whatever was handled by Wyatt as he should have handled it.

113
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:43,786
Rym: Uh-huh I was gonna have props to Wyatt because I gave him that stupid radio like the con radio For like three hours on Saturday right as a million people were calling for Rym.

114
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:48,346
Rym: Yeah Whatever I was like Wyatt everyone's asking for me pretend you're me and sort it out.

115
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:49,150

118
00:06:57,057 --> 00:07:01,129
Scott: Cuz I was trying to do my laundry and go to bed But then I had to wash a bunch of clothes in the sink.

119
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:04,979
Rym: How long could that possibly have taken?

120
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:06,366
Scott: it took a while dirt.

121
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:07,170
Scott: it doesn't come out easy.

122
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,418
Scott: Yeah, it takes a lot of water.

123
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:12,490
Rym: so you got any gaming news, I don't know.

124
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:16,055
Scott: There's no gaming news But I do there is some gaming news.

125
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:17,178
Rym: Pax West.

126
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:21,150
Rym: Pax Prime is pretty much gonna be sold out any minute.

127
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:26,030
Rym: So if you haven't bought your passes and you want to go why probably too late?

128
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,510
Scott: Why didn't you buy the pass when they originally went on sale also?

129
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,490
Rym: I'll point out if you bought your passes, but you haven't like done your travel arrangements yet.

130
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:38,925
Rym: It's about the time when like doing flight arrangements around now is not so bad like that.

131
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,310
Rym: That's perfectly reasonable.

132
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,515
Rym: There's only one hotel left.

133
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:47,270
Rym: cuz I just logged in to change something to my hotel reservation and there's one hotel left.

134
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,218
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why people wait so long.

135
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:51,562
Scott: It's like it's a. you know, it's.

136
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:52,084
Scott: so it's.

137
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:53,468
Scott: it's what?

138
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:55,669
Scott: two months or now Less than two months, right?

139
00:07:57,134 --> 00:08:00,910
Scott: This like, you know when they announce the dates for the convention?

140
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:05,363
Rym: That's the day now like only if the hotel blocks are set up.

141
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:12,694
Scott: you want but I'm just saying you buy the badge at least Right, you don't don't wait if you decided to go Decide to go and go.

142
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:15,986
Rym: a lot of people don't actually decide to go until later.

143
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,230
Scott: or they say you don't decide Yes, right away.

144
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,496
Scott: The answer is no no.

145
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:23,837
Rym: or they say I will go but and then there's some sort of Precondition that they can't decide.

146
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:28,019
Scott: right if you have a precondition the answer is no you're not going to make it someone else is gonna make.

147
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:34,030
Rym: what it really comes down to is and What I'm about to say all of you out there could easily just come back and say no room.

148
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,235
Rym: This is just because you have a ton of money.

149
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:39,250
Rym: A lot of people don't have the money to pre-register right away.

150
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,215
Rym: What's the one kid in the forum?

151
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,486
Rym: He was like, yeah, I don't get paid until Thursday.

152
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:44,928
Scott: Oh crap Why don't you have a credit card?

153
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:46,595
Rym: Not get into that.

154
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:51,314
Rym: a lot of people just reading kind of the Otakon forms and everything They do like.

155
00:08:51,354 --> 00:09:00,363
Rym: their primary concern is they don't have enough money to actually get the badge Early enough if you don't have up if you don't have that much money don't go.

156
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:01,347
Scott: No, no, no.

157
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:02,169
Rym: No, that's not it.

158
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:13,276
Rym: You do have that much money because I used to be so poor I couldn't even really afford to eat an anime conventions and I and I with no money and basically nothing to my name Because I wanted it.

159
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:15,487
Rym: I got that money for the Otakon badge.

160
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:18,688
Rym: somehow Somehow man, I actually didn't pay rent that month.

161
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,450
Rym: Literally, I didn't pay rent and I had money to go to Otakon as a result.

162
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:26,750
Scott: The point is is that if you know don't listen to Rym, right?

163
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:39,783
Scott: You just listen to me the reasonable first university if you are if you're in a situation Where like 50 bucks which is usually like, you know, a pretty high price for a con badge Usually if you order them early enough, it's 30 40 ish, right?

164
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,350
Scott: If 50 bucks is like an amount of money that you have to like, you know, tear yourself over like you're not confident.

165
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,896
Scott: You know, you don't just have 50 bucks.

166
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,886
Scott: You probably shouldn't be spending your money on a convention.

167
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,835
Scott: That's probably an irresponsible This thing to do.

168
00:09:54,855 --> 00:10:01,369
Scott: you should probably be using your money for food and rent Being you know several hundred dollars.

169
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:07,290
Rym: But remember the old days when we were poor all like, you know people in the crew were various levels of porn.

170
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,910
Rym: Is we'd go to Otakon and I remember we calculated if you stay in the Renaissance eight people can sleep in each room.

171
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:21,272
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty cheap to go to a con if you crime eight people in and you basically eat nothing but garbage for the entire Weekend.

172
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:31,090
Scott: the point is is that if you know if 50 bucks is is tight for you Conventions are not the thing you should be doing unless it happens to be like in your town or something like that.

173
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,444
Rym: You know see I still say 50 bucks.

174
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:36,907
Rym: You should forego more important things and go to the con if you want it.

175
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:37,550
Rym: that badly.

176
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:41,270
Rym: I wanted Otakon more than I wanted to continue to have an apartment.

177
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:51,829
Scott: Eating well is and you know sleeping in a comfortable warm sheltered place is more important than going to a convention of which there Will be one for every year the rest of your life.

178
00:10:52,051 --> 00:11:07,570
Rym: So Scott if you had to face some some sort of small period of homelessness at some point in your past But as a result would have had gone to all the paxes as opposed to just the ones we went to What if you would have had even homeless for a month while you're at RIT and then for that?

179
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,576
Rym: You went to every pax up to that point.

180
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:10,017
Scott: Yeah.

181
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:11,522
Scott: No, I would not be homeless now.

182
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:13,427
Rym: No, why not understand someone's couch?

183
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,968
Scott: Oh I was talking about sleeping out in the woods.

184
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:22,674
Rym: That's more my side of the mountain Or Sleeping on the street.

185
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,585
Scott: I mean if I'm on someone's couch and not really homeless Emma.

186
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:26,428
Rym: So no gaming news.

187
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:26,870
Rym: you got nothing.

188
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:28,919
Scott: No, I have a non gaming news.

189
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:30,827
Scott: It is a huge news.

190
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:31,450
Scott: You ready for this?

191
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:31,933
Scott: I don't know.

192
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,969
Scott: I I don't know why you didn't think this is your news.

193
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,742
Scott: You obviously probably didn't go and look at any headlines.

194
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:37,485
Rym: All right.

195
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:38,610
Rym: I know a lot about news.

196
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,267
Rym: You know part of my job is to know what's going on.

197
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:46,950
Scott: All right This is a huge news because this is this is almost the level of partying news.

198
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:50,387
Scott: It is almost level of DMCA struck down parting news.

199
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:50,889
Scott: It is like one.

200
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:54,350
Rym: Oh, you're talking about the FCC is one level under that news.

201
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,517
Rym: You're talking about Massachusetts and the FCC thing.

202
00:11:56,698 --> 00:12:00,410
Scott: FCC indecency rules struck down by appeals court.

203
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,136
Rym: How about which?

204
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:02,004
Rym: which courts got?

205
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:02,609
Rym: is it my man?

206
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:04,960
Scott: Let us go and see what.

207
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:06,470
Rym: why is it the Ninth Circuit Court?

208
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,210
Scott: Oh the Ninth Circuit Court actually did a dick move the other did the dick move on the on the first sale, right?

209
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,437
Rym: Yeah, but I'm not talking about that.

210
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:15,060
Scott: No, I don't.

211
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,998
Scott: it doesn't say let's see US Circuit Court Judge Rosemary Pooler, I don't know who that is.

212
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,190
Scott: I don't know who that is either she but I know that she's a US Circuit Judge.

213
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:33,307
Rym: I remember it slashed out actually that an article that talked about that and the Massachusetts law that basically says Anything that could be harmful to minors and this vague description of it can't be on the internet if minors could ever see it.

214
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:40,677
Scott: Mm-hmm well, anyway, basically They said hey, look, this is so vague, right?

215
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:42,702
Scott: The big problem with it was the vagueness, right?

216
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:55,146
Rym: Okay, so it's okay to do this but 75% or more of a nipple from a front on to 30-degree angle that we need.

217
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,550
Rym: we need laws like that.

218
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,790
Scott: Yeah, you know, so basically they were like look this is too vague side nipples.

219
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:09,241
Scott: It has a. it is a let's see ruling that the policy was quote Unconstitutionally vague and created a quote chilling effect.

220
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:10,986
Rym: Well, fuck chilling effect.

221
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:12,090
Scott: I'm constantly vague.

222
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,710
Scott: Get it out of here now, can we please get some other thing now, you know, this is great.

223
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:19,583
Scott: I mean, how often is it that we actually get rid of one of these shitty laws?

224
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:20,668
Rym: Well, well, well, it's gonna.

225
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:21,612
Scott: well It's not even.

226
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:22,596
Scott: it's not even a law.

227
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:24,404
Scott: It's it's a. it's a regulation.

228
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:28,350
Scott: It's gonna get appealed Of course, of course, but this was an appeal.

229
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,136
Scott: So we'll see what they said.

230
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:32,143
Scott: they said they they felt confident.

231
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:34,210
Scott: the Supreme Court would you know?

232
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,393
Rym: I'm confident.

233
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:39,609
Rym: the Supreme Court is going to do whatever causes the least change.

234
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:43,626
Rym: The Supreme Court has really been balls-less for the last like 15 years.

235
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:46,109
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty sad.

236
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:57,550
Scott: It's like whenever anything if you look like lately whenever anything goes to the Supreme Court They'll basically like here's an opportunity to make a big, you know to make a big ruling that will set a good precedent.

237
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,170
Scott: We're gonna do as little as possible.

238
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,073
Scott: You know, there'd be a case about like, you know that some guy with like Miranda rights or whatever and they'll be like, yeah He's guilty.

239
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:07,225
Rym: Okay, where's John Marshall when we need him?

240
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:08,230
Rym: I don't know.

241
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,313
Rym: I would give anything to bring John Marshall back from the dead and just throw him in the court me like hey fix everything He's dead.

242
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:14,980
Rym: Yeah, we gotta get him back somehow.

243
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,441
Scott: Well, we should just have John Marshall the second right.

244
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,736
Rym: So I was hanging out in the.

245
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:22,398
Rym: I guess we should.

246
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:26,755
Rym: we'll have to hold out and see what happens with this because if it Makes it all the way and we win.

247
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:29,527
Rym: I think it deserves an entire show the whole show.

248
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:45,910
Scott: I think so The show will just be vuvuzela's and me going Your mom Hopefully, I mean, I hope this means that we can like they'll be swearing on TV tomorrow.

249
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,641
Scott: Right, it's our park gonna say fuck in the next episode.

250
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:51,335
Rym: I mean that Park isn't going on even right now I don't know.

251
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:53,410
Rym: I don't think there's been an episode since the whole Muhammad thing.

252
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,334
Scott: How did a?

253
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:54,856
Scott: I don't know.

254
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:58,550
Rym: by the way, if you guys didn't realize the the little GeekNights guy, you know our logo.

255
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:01,649
Rym: He is actually a depiction of the Prophet Muhammad of the Islam faith.

256
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:07,195
Scott: You Just decided that right now.

257
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:10,430
Rym: so I was in the the panel ops room.

258
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,329
Rym: well, really the con ops room of ConnectiCon right and Scott was up dealing with some crisis and I'm working on something.

259
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,890
Rym: and One of the ops people who's like monitoring all the computers.

260
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,863
Rym: He's also got Firefox open because there's not you know fires to put out all the time.

261
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:24,569
Rym: He says, huh?

262
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:30,106
Rym: Civ 5 deluxe box a hundred bucks and they're like eight staffers in the room.

263
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:32,739
Rym: We all same Simultaneously say shit.

264
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:42,810
Rym: I already pre-ordered And then we all walk over and see and yeah sure enough There's a hundred dollar like Civ 5 awesome box and I didn't think I'd want it.

265
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:48,572
Rym: But now that I'm looking at a picture of it this art deco kind of like aesthetic that it's got going I don't.

266
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:49,937
Scott: I don't see this on steam.

267
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,776
Rym: It's it's not on steam as far as I can tell not yet I don't even know if it's available to purchase.

268
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,863
Scott: Well, if it's not the steam one, why do I want it?

269
00:15:57,325 --> 00:16:11,669
Rym: Basically, it's $100 and It comes with a big art book like a hardcover art book five pewter or some sort of metal like casts of Military units from the game and the soundtrack and I think that's all it up.

270
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:18,358
Rym: I think there's a DVD behind-the-scenes thing too, and that's it All right big deal and it cost double.

271
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,862
Scott: Yeah, not worth it.

272
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,130
Scott: I just want the game is the same, right?

273
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,233
Rym: Yeah, the game is the same.

274
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,384
Rym: So what would have made the hundred dollar bonus pack worth it?

275
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,832
Rym: You also get civilization six I don't know.

276
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:35,947
Rym: I just want a wall size poster of Washington from the art in the game.

277
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:37,934
Scott: Just print one out Wall size.

278
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,702
Rym: I need a high-resolution copy.

279
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:41,730
Scott: go down to any of those printing guys in the city.

280
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:49,501
Rym: No, I need a high-resolution master or you can't just blow stuff up Scott You can just get it right out of the game Depends on how high-resolution it is.

281
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:50,910
Scott: usually like civilization.

282
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:58,679
Scott: Actually, the games have a tendency like the game itself obviously is an open source But usually like all this like the resources in the game.

283
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:06,210
Scott: I'll be like odd audio or Python, you know Six foot tall poster, right?

284
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,712
Scott: So you would get the 3d model out of the game Which would probably.

285
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:13,067
Scott: you could probably load it into something and then you know, just render it out.

286
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:13,868
Rym: It's hard to say.

287
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,753
Scott: It is hard to say.

288
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:23,609
Rym: Yeah, but maybe if it imagine if it came with a six-foot poster of Like your choice five of the leaders from the game.

289
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,801
Rym: I just love that Washington so much.

290
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,130
Rym: I want him to tuck me in at night.

291
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:30,869
Rym: I want him like glaring at me while I'm asleep keeping the British away.

292
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:54,390
Rym: So things of the day I'll often cop out with the College Humor because they're you know Pretty much it's a. there's always something worth seeing every day on the College Humor videos But that's kind of lame, but you know smart listeners know to just go to College Humor and watch that stuff.

293
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:56,238
Rym: So yeah, and I did.

294
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:01,519
Rym: the secret secret is that when I need something on a cop-out I just go to BB spot because no one goes to.

295
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:12,759
Rym: because he goes the old websites of a decade ago like Slashdot and BB spot and me because no one goes there and BB spot like within a given week There'll be one thing on BB spot.

296
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:13,824
Rym: That wasn't everywhere else.

297
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,090
Scott: I can't believe the site still updates.

298
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,389
Rym: I know what kind of traffic who goes to BB spot you do, you know, it doesn't update me.

299
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:27,528
Rym: pool Yeah, people's been definitely what I like to mean pool back in the day It was kind of a weird and eclectic thing, but I think that whole idea is obsolete.

300
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:38,228
Rym: But anyway This is a is an odyssey through what happens when you look something up on Wikipedia and You start following the links on Wikipedia to other links.

301
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:40,377
Rym: So I'm gonna tell you a short story.

302
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,789
Rym: It's the the melancholy of Peter Puck.

303
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,596
Rym: Okay, you know who Peter Puck is?

304
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:47,901
Scott: His last name is Puck.

305
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:48,463
Scott: That's pretty.

306
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:50,189
Rym: no his last name is not Puck.

307
00:18:51,431 --> 00:19:06,973
Rym: His name is Peter Pocklington, okay, so I'll preface this by saying there's only one person one name on The Stanley Cup, you know Lord Stanley's Cup that was after the fact X'd out.

308
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,639
Rym: there are X's engraved over.

309
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,622
Scott: why don't they just?

310
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,890
Scott: why don't they just sort of you know smooth it?

311
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,955
Rym: I really can't do that.

312
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:13,599
Scott: Why not?

313
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,370
Rym: I don't want to get into the details.

314
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:16,655
Rym: They can't do that.

315
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:20,250
Scott: Well, you may get some heat and you melt this little bit of silver.

316
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,110
Scott: Yeah, you're ruining the Stanley Cup and then you polish it and you know get some sanding in there.

317
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,372
Rym: You know anything about silversmithing buffing Uh-huh.

318
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:32,339
Rym: Now it's engraved pretty deeply.

319
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,523
Rym: Have you seen the Stanley Cup?

320
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,186
Scott: Give me a Dremel.

321
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:34,888
Scott: I'll take it out.

322
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:41,650
Rym: Yeah Anyway, there is an X engraved into every single letter of one and only one name.

323
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:45,250
Scott: So they put an X over each letter instead of just a line through the whole thing.

324
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,197
Rym: Yes, they really wanted to get rid of it.

325
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:52,090
Rym: Okay, and There are like 12 or 13 other like tiny typos all over it.

326
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,037
Rym: There's a whole history of like all the different things.

327
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,462
Scott: They just fucking fix it.

328
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:57,590
Scott: Well, I don't make a mistake in the first play.

329
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:58,612
Rym: well There's.

330
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:06,744
Rym: it's not easy to get rid of these mistakes and also since they've been there and since the replicas are replicas of it You know, it's like kind of like the history like this is this mistake.

331
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,790
Rym: This is when this happened.

332
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:14,696
Scott: This is this guy and I'm sure if a guy makes a mistake to get a new fucking jeweler I mean, you know actually there's been a lot of.

333
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:21,488
Rym: there's whole stories about like how they couldn't afford to get another band Once they filled up the first band back in the day.

334
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:25,259
Rym: Yeah, the story of the Stanley Cup is crazy.

335
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,142
Scott: They have enough money.

336
00:20:26,162 --> 00:20:27,325
Rym: No, they didn't.

337
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:29,390
Rym: and you know what when there was the strike.

338
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,799
Rym: There's actually a space where they engraved.

339
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:34,316
Rym: no one won because there was the strike No one played hockey.

340
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,210
Scott: I thought that they just sort of didn't put anything.

341
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,041
Rym: No, there's this hole because they write every time they add.

342
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,811
Scott: if they add a new one they add they write the year on it Right.

343
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:47,267
Scott: Yeah, so it should just be like, you know, 2000 whatever and then if it's the there's no.

344
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:52,474
Rym: actually says You know there was nothing this year like they made a point of being like look you assholes Look what you did.

346
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,584
Rym: it's kind of a record.

347
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:55,830
Rym: It's like an engraving.

348
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,350
Rym: This is the record of the Lords of the realm or at least the Lords of hockey.

349
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,585
Scott: So why doesn't you just have my name every time like you can't even skate.

350
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:06,190
Scott: I'm the Lord of the realm though.

351
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:10,123
Rym: So if you look at the names on the Stanley Cup, there is crazy stuff.

352
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:23,250
Rym: They're like, they're the first woman My name is 8 equals equals equals D. Marguerite Norris was the president of the Detroit Red Wings in 1954 and 1955 and they happen to win the Stanley Cup both those years.

Rym: So she was the first woman to have her name on the Stanley Cup and she got it on there twice.

354
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,602
Rym: One guy has his name on it 17 times.

355
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,049
Rym: Did he win 17 John Beliveau?

356
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,097
Scott: He just kept switching the teams that won.

357
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:44,743
Rym: no ten is a player and then seven is management Trickery and also a Vladimir Konstantinov also on the Red Wings.

358
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:52,630
Rym: if you read through a Surprising number of the like weird stories about the Stanley Cup our destroyed Red Wings, you know six and everything.

399
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:12,550
Rym: He was on the bad team.

400
00:24:13,612 --> 00:24:18,990
Rym: Okay, but all this aside Peter Pocklington's name is not on Lord Stanley's Cup.

401
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:26,540
Rym: His father's name basil Pocklington Mysteriously appeared on the Stanley Cup.

402
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:29,749

403
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,868
Rym: you know He was supposed to go in the cup and he submitted the list.

404
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:41,006
Rym: Well, so he was the manager of a team and the team submitted the list And he just put his dad's name in with all the players and no one noticed.

405
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:41,669
Rym: and it was there.

406
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:49,443
Rym: When the NHL find I found out they were like, ah, no, no, no, no, no, no exes exes for you.

407
00:24:51,412 --> 00:24:53,039
Scott: So wait, so they caught it before.

408
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,642
Scott: it's the way they.

409
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:55,530

410
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,052
Rym: It was done.

411
00:24:56,393 --> 00:25:01,629
Rym: So they went back and they engraved exes into every letter of basil Pocklington's name.

412
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:05,502
Rym: He's the only person ever redacted from the Stanley Cup.

413
00:25:05,522 --> 00:25:07,709

415
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:10,481
Rym: no, he was just.

416
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:11,988
Rym: he was the one who tricked any lie.

417
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,183
Rym: He was like, I don't know how my dad's name got on the list.

418
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:16,570
Rym: The engraver must have made a mistake.

419
00:25:16,912 --> 00:25:17,636
Scott: So they just never.

420
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,850

421
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,082
Scott: His dad's name got ex off, but then they didn't put his name on there either.

422
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:23,986

423
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:24,548
Scott: Oh, is it?

427
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,190

00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:39,162
Scott: obviously using the song I will survive.

451
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:50,235
Scott: but in the video there is a man his daughter and his three grandchildren and they are dancing and The I will survive.

452
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:53,530
Scott: song is playing and they dance in front of many locations.

453
00:26:53,530 --> 00:27:04,144
Scott: It's one of those, you know multiple location videos like, you know, when Luke Burge does the juggling in many locations I saw or when the guy was dancing in multiple locations around the world.

454
00:27:04,184 --> 00:27:05,127
Rym: nothing controversial.

455
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:05,990
Rym: Nothing interesting.

456
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:14,670
Scott: all of the locations are either Nazi concentration camps or you know memorials or other such places.

457
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:19,003
Scott: Alright, but the man is a holocaust survivor.

458
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:21,470
Scott: So it's like whoa, so epic win.

459
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:22,754
Rym: What else can I say?

460
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:27,830
Scott: but half the internet is like, I don't know if this is offensive or awesome.

461
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:30,436
Scott: They can't tell.

462
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:33,589
Rym: I don't know about half the internet cuz I had no idea this was going on.

463
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:35,755
Scott: Yeah, but that's pretty much what it is.

464
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:38,142
Rym: So so apparently 350,000 people have their opinions on this.

465
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:42,364
Scott: Yeah so there's gonna be.

466
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:47,423
Rym: Yeah, wait, is it the original song or the cake version?

467
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:48,868
Scott: No, it's it's the original.

468
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:51,885
Rym: Okay All right now Scott's playing it.

469
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:55,037
Rym: So the meta moment.

470
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:57,706
Rym: if you can tell we're kind of dragging here, you know, we're.

471
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:58,990
Rym: we just got back from ConnectiCon.

472
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,493
Rym: We're a little.

473
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:00,944
Rym: we're a little wrecked.

474
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:04,209
Rym: I'm still right This is definitely cut one of those crab people shows.

475
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:08,830
Rym: But the meta moment the book club book is the lies of Locke Lamora, which was also recommended to be ready.

476
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,533
Rym: I think it's Lamora.

477
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:10,356
Scott: I think it's Lamora.

478
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,610
Rym: I don't Lamora sounds because it flows with the lies of Locke Lamora.

479
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:15,119
Scott: I think it's lies of like Lamora.

480
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:15,783
Scott: sound is better.

481
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:16,850
Scott: I'm better in the mouth.

482
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:20,522
Rym: It's weird because he doesn't really lie that much except in specific cons.

483
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,750
Rym: He's actually a hundred percent truthful all the rest of the time.

484
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:23,909
Scott: That's why it's awesome.

485
00:28:26,113 --> 00:28:29,902
Rym: We're going to be at the penny arcade expo Labor Day weekend 2010 in Seattle.

486
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:36,770
Rym: We cannot announce all of the programming we're doing because it is not better than we can announce any program.

487
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,549
Rym: Yeah, we can't because now we've officially two of our panels are already set.

488
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:47,319
Rym: We are going to be doing a panel called egregiously unrealized potential Right, which I think you can get.

489
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,370
Rym: that I call that x-rays or the panel.

490
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:53,210
Rym: Okay, and we're doing game mechanics and mechanism design.

491
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:58,492
Rym: basically every panel we've done up at this point has in gaming has been kind of a like.

492
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:06,266
Rym: we talked about some topic and we always come back to like game mechanics and Mechanism design and every time all the feedback we get basically comes down to yep.

493
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:07,270
Rym: That was awesome.

494
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,635
Rym: But could you go into more detail?

495
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:12,169
Rym: or we're just gonna go hardcore and see if packs can handle it.

496
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:13,795
Scott: We'll find out.

497
00:29:14,437 --> 00:29:21,901
Rym: and other programming is of course TBA, but we got one or two more things in the hopper alrighty PAX East.

498
00:29:22,102 --> 00:29:24,493
Rym: we're gonna be doing stuff at anime.

499
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:28,304
Rym: Boston New York Comic Con New York anime festival and the burning wheel.

500
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:31,912
Rym: 10 10 10 are all on the weekend of October 8th 9th and 10th.

501
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:32,314
Scott: Yes.

502
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:36,790
Scott: Oh and October 8th is happens to be a nerd NYC board game night.

503
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:40,602
Scott: Also also this Friday is a nerd NYC board game night.

504
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:44,529
Rym: July 16th dirt NYC thinks cafe You should totally come check it out.

505
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,293
Scott: Well, I think there's.

506
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:49,190
Scott: the August is an August and September one, but you can go to the nerd NYC website and find out.

507
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,837
Scott: and On Monday, there's some sort of gaming thing.

508
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:54,880
Scott: I'm going to it's.

509
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:58,050
Scott: it's got like the CEO of take two is gonna be there.

510
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,133
Scott: It's on Kotaku.

511
00:29:59,554 --> 00:30:00,116
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

512
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:03,204
Scott: It seems pretty interesting as ten bucks is downtown.

513
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:03,826
Scott: Why not?

514
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,983
Scott: I Think that's enough meta.

515
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:07,232
Rym: Yes I think.

516
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,124
Rym: so energy levels are low.

517
00:30:09,185 --> 00:30:14,829
Rym: We got to bring him back up uh-huh, so Why everybody old man attack?

518
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,861
Scott: I am giving the secret but you still try old man attack gonna do a show on high space.

519
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:22,184
Scott: Oh my gosh.

520
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,556
Rym: I Wonder if it's updated.

521
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:29,114
Scott: it's it's not updated but it still exists All right.

522
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,282
Scott: This was Scott's idea.

523
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:32,515
Scott: Oh So you just like I say anything.

524
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:35,590
Scott: no, no, no, no, no, but basically I was like I went through it.

525
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,950
Scott: I'm like why do we need something to do a show on that?

526
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,818
Scott: We've played and we haven't played anything recently.

527
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,369
Scott: So it's got to be you know, something old.

528
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:45,063
Rym: I've been playing Counter-Strike almost every day.

529
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,249
Scott: We've done a show on that though.

530
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:48,528
Scott: Yeah, so it has to be something we haven't done a show on.

531
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:54,679
Scott: actually I was playing on militia and I bought a new board game But Rym hasn't played II and I only played the solitaire version of it.

532
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,545
Rym: So basically Yahtzee.

533
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:58,552
Scott: You don't know that you it's good Trust me.

534
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:01,266
Rym: I know but I read the board game geek reviews and people like yeah, it's Yahtzee.

535
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:01,709
Rym: Where's then?

536
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:03,674
Scott: It doesn't wear thin.

537
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:05,961
Scott: Oh, it was pretty good even by myself.

538
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:06,463
Scott: It was fun.

539
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:06,884
Scott: We'll see.

540
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:11,075
Scott: anyway the Yah, right.

541
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:17,348
Scott: So I'm like, hey, what about like the Absolute basics like have we done a show on fucking like, you know, Zelda 1?

542
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:20,723
Scott: and sure enough We had done a show on four swords and that is it.

543
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:22,612
Scott: We had never done a show on Zelda 1.

544
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:32,830
Rym: So what's interesting is that alright finally, you know GeekNights We're gonna have this show on the Legend of Zelda straight up and we start talking about the game More than halfway through this show.

545
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:34,673
Scott: That's fine.

546
00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:38,008
Rym: I'm surprised you're all even still listening at this point or you're just anticipating.

547
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:38,390
Rym: you're waiting.

548
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:38,853
Rym: You want us?

549
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:39,800
Rym: What are you gonna say?

550
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,009
Rym: get that you get the Triforce?

551
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:45,530
Scott: So, yeah, you saw that you get it twice.

552
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:49,017
Scott: Anyway, no, so I got you know.

553
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:50,743
Scott: thing is Zelda 1 like?

554
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:52,790
Scott: I still think it is the best Zelda.

555
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:56,989
Rym: No one else does but I I still think Zelda 2 is well.

556
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:58,017
Scott: No one agrees.

557
00:31:58,097 --> 00:31:59,789
Scott: even less people agree with you than agree with me.

558
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:03,926
Rym: Of course They're in different genres like Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 fought like they were.

559
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:14,424
Rym: they were different Genres from the control and from a lot of aspects, but in many ways They're also the same genre of you know Explore this world get the Triforce pieces or something of that ilk.

560
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:17,535
Rym: go save the princess in some manner Bosses along the way.

561
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:23,570
Scott: most people will say that ocarina of time or link to the past is the best one But I think they're almost they're in a different genre.

562
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,353
Rym: They were.

563
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:27,826
Rym: they opened up this whole different idea of what a Zelda game would be.

564
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:42,650
Scott: hmm I think that what's makes all the one simultaneously great but also so painful for anyone who's never played it before to play it now is that it really Doesn't give you like the helping hints so much as are you kidding?

565
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,688
Rym: It as a full-color instruction book with a comic in it.

566
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:55,302
Scott: Well, yeah, but I mean most people who play it today are not gonna get those things Right, like when I got Zelda 1. first of all I had some extra knowledge because I had watched other people play on their Nintendo's.

567
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:56,627
Scott: so I had that hid.

568
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,530
Scott: I had those secrets.

569
00:32:57,957 --> 00:32:58,830
Rym: I started from nothing.

570
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:03,380
Scott: I also had you know It came with a map of like the beginning area of the game.

571
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,344
Scott: that helped me out a lot.

572
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:08,641
Scott: it came with you know all this stuff and Came with an instruction book.

573
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:09,750
Scott: that it all sorts of information.

574
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,570
Rym: You might not recall this but remember the beauty of the Legend of Zelda.

575
00:33:14,212 --> 00:33:19,449
Rym: The map that came in the instruction book showed you where you start and it showed you where level 1 is.

576
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,535
Scott: Right, it even shows you.

577
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:21,600
Scott: I think we're level 2 and 3 were.

578
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:28,232
Rym: it shows you where level 2 is But it does not show you how to get to the spot to get into level 2.

579
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:30,142
Rym: So you have to go around outside of this map.

580
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:30,806
Rym: They've given you.

581
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:32,394
Rym: Mm-hmm I mean check that out.

582
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:37,783
Rym: That is some good like give the kid a hint but then make oh no No, no, that's the map that's in the book.

583
00:33:37,864 --> 00:33:38,910
Rym: That's what I said.

584
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:44,690
Scott: Mine I had that - mine came with a separate map that was on its own piece of paper.

585
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:49,707
Scott: That was quite impressive and it showed you like the location of certain things like the.

586
00:33:49,787 --> 00:33:51,738
Scott: the power bracelet I think was even on that map.

587
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:53,569
Scott: It was a very high quality map.

588
00:33:53,831 --> 00:34:00,702
Rym: But what people also forget is that if you look at the story in the beginning of the book There is in fact a map of the entire game right there.

589
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:05,529
Scott: Yeah, but it is not a Detailed enough map but it is a. it is a high quality map.

590
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,553
Rym: Actually them if you look at it the map is detailed enough to figure out how to get to anywhere in the game Really?

591
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:13,610
Rym: It even shows you where that secret shit is way off on the right.

592
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:21,617
Scott: Yeah, the thing is right is that if you look at a modern Zelda game say for example Twilight Princess right you get the hookshot.

593
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:26,030
Scott: every place that you can use the hookshot like clearly has like a hookshot thing.

594
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,040
Scott: It's like here you can hookshot right to this spot.

595
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,884
Scott: It's like they don't make.

596
00:34:28,904 --> 00:34:30,070
Scott: keep any secrets about it.

597
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,429
Scott: You know, it's not like you have to experiment hookshotting.

598
00:34:32,731 --> 00:34:36,329
Scott: You just have to look around and you'll be able to see any hookshot able spots.

599
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:38,295
Scott: You know It's the same thing with the bow and arrow like.

600
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:41,190
Scott: there'll be a fucking eyeball if you can shoot it with the bow and arrow.

601
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:43,257
Scott: In Zelda 1.

602
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:47,813
Scott: I mean occasionally they might put some cracks in the walls where you could bomb But that they.

603
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:51,250
Scott: there are plenty of places you could bomb that look just like every other wall.

604
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,221
Scott: They didn't stand out in any way shape or form.

605
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,750
Rym: you don't forget the second quest.

606
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:56,621
Rym: We could also just walk through certain walls.

607
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:58,190
Scott: Yeah, you just walk right through the wall.

608
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,164
Scott: So you have to try to walk through every single wall that you come across.

609
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:02,310
Scott: that isn't already.

610
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:07,750
Scott: You know that walks into the black part of the map just to make sure that there isn't like a secret room back.

611
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:13,578
Rym: Well, I think part of it is that the for us at least for the generation that played Zelda 1 There was nothing to compete with it.

612
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,710
Rym: I mean every other game like there was no game.

613
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,499
Rym: There's nothing even close to this and it really you know Even the creator like it was.

614
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:25,350
Rym: the idea was you're exploring like though like you're in a kit You're a kid in the woods and you're exploring with a ton of free time.

615
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:25,671
Scott: This

616
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:48,010
Rym: is a game to explore but while it seems so like opaque and obtuse to a lot of modern gamers This instruction book like you read it and it gives you all these kind of Oblique hints like it doesn't tell you straight up where to find the bosses and all the dungeons But it names all the dungeons and it shows you the shape of like a monster or a thing.

617
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:53,330
Rym: And if you explore these dungeons you start to realize that they all follow the shapes intuitively.

618
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:59,689
Scott: yeah, most of the dungeons like the bad guy is in the nose or the eyeball.

619
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,421
Rym: or Do you remember the names of all the dungeons?

620
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:04,250
Scott: I don't remember the names of the dungeons.

621
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,198
Scott: I could say the names of the bosses all of them.

622
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:06,760
Rym: Yeah.

623
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:07,683
Rym: All right, let's go.

624
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:10,732
Scott: All right level one Aquamentous.

625
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,443
Scott: quite level two dodongo.

626
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:15,310
Scott: All right level three.

627
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:18,474
Scott: Oh god, I know it.

628
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:19,998
Rym: You're forgetting Mon, Hanla.

629
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:20,419
Scott: Yes.

630
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:21,121
Scott: Damn it.

631
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:22,084
Scott: I knew it, but I didn't.

632
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:22,826
Scott: I didn't know it.

633
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:31,691
Scott: No anyway Level four is the hydra and his name is Gula.

634
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,055
Scott: Oh glia.

635
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:35,521
Scott: Yeah level five is dig dagger.

636
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:38,770
Scott: Yeah level six is gliok with an extra.

637
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:42,820
Scott: Level seven is Aquamentous again.

638
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,246
Rym: Oh shit level eight.

639
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:44,627
Scott: No.

640
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:45,974
Scott: No level six I got it wrong.

641
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:49,170
Scott: level six does have a gliok with an extra head, but the boss is red Goma.

642
00:36:50,012 --> 00:36:50,473
Scott: I was wrong.

643
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:51,235
Rym: I go.

644
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:55,445
Scott: level eight also has a gliok with an extra head and his blue Goma.

645
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:57,450
Scott: and then level nine has Ganon.

646
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,258
Rym: Don't remember the names of dungeons do ya know?

647
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:01,619
Scott: not at all.

648
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,264
Rym: Eagle moon manji snake lizard dragon demon Lion, and then just death mountain.

649
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:08,410
Scott: Well, I could have told you death mountain.

650
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,937
Rym: Yeah, but note the death mountain.

651
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:15,030
Rym: the skull is shaped like the rock that you have to bomb.

652
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:16,838
Scott: Not really.

653
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:19,509
Scott: I mean kind of not so much.

654
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:24,520
Rym: I'm on the instruction book and All these little hints that some of them weren't even relevant to us as kids.

655
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,857
Rym: like Paul's voice it says in this instruction book a ghost With big ears and a weak point.

656
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:33,790
Rym: He hates loud noise and I remember as a kid There's a million of them in the room try to whistle.

657
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:37,150
Rym: I tried the whistle and do anything and the sword didn't hurt him.

658
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:43,446
Scott: But the arrows hurt him just fine because the Famicom had microphones in the controller Yeah, but the NES did not and they didn't change it.

659
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:47,145
Scott: So yeah, you would shoot the arrow and it would.

660
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:48,090
Scott: that was the way to kill him.

661
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:58,010
Rym: But there's so many just like hints and things to where a kid, you know You read this book and puzzle over it and the book was really part of the game And a lot of people kind of forget the instruction book.

662
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:05,570
Rym: This game was sort of a puzzle and the book and the game together Guided a young kid's mind through this exploration.

663
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:13,330
Scott: I think that what really makes the game is just that you know when you're still Discovering it when you're still a kid and you've never played it before and you don't know the map.

664
00:38:13,811 --> 00:38:15,537
Scott: Everything just feels so mystical.

665
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,564
Scott: It's like oh my god the graveyard.

666
00:38:17,624 --> 00:38:18,166
Scott: Holy shit.

667
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:19,370
Scott: There's a fucking oh my god.

668
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,030
Scott: Look at this and it's all like woo the graveyard.

669
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:26,043
Rym: That whole upper left area of the map scares me to this day a little bit.

670
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,610
Rym: Yeah, I know you shouldn't be up there.

671
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,608
Rym: There's nothing over there.

672
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:34,473
Scott: It's like you uncover all these things and it's so like it just has this feel to it Like you're.

673
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:36,470
Scott: you have uncovered something mystical.

674
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:38,799
Scott: I don't know what it is, but it just did.

675
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:41,747
Scott: no other game has really pulled that off so much You know.

676
00:38:42,213 --> 00:38:48,332
Scott: I think it's a combination of like just the way The areas are presented to you and the way you're well Very like.

677
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,975
Rym: every region kind of has this feeling.

678
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:52,120
Rym: every dungeon has its own like aesthetic to it.

679
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,877
Scott: Yeah, and it's like there's no one.

680
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,142
Scott: there's no one really out there.

681
00:38:56,202 --> 00:39:03,490
Scott: I mean, it's like you can talk to people But you know old man and old woman, but that's pretty much it and they don't really help you that much.

682
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:03,912
Scott: They're.

683
00:39:03,952 --> 00:39:07,210
Scott: so, you know, they speak in sort of rhymes and stuff.

684
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:12,548
Scott: It's almost like a more like a labyrinth II kind of thing than a Metroid kind of thing, you know, I'll buy something.

685
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:12,789
Rym: Will ya?

686
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,065
Scott: All right, that's not old man or old woman.

687
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:20,076
Scott: That's fat guy merchant fat merchant Yeah, and then it's like you.

688
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:25,137
Scott: just you sort of like discover these things that like the game didn't tell you about them But you discover them on your own.

689
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,790
Scott: It's sort of like you just find this power bracelet out there.

690
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,075
Scott: It's like oh shit power brace.

691
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:30,622
Rym: Let's remember there's never again.

692
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:32,590
Scott: You find like the secret shortcuts under the rocks.

693
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:33,294
Scott: It's like oh shit.

694
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:34,442
Scott: The game didn't tell me about this.

695
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:35,790
Rym: You just discovered the whole game.

696
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,010
Rym: You're playing around keep seeing these like docks and you try to walk on them and nothing happens.

697
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:45,370
Rym: And then later in the game you find a raft and you run around all these docks and there's crazy shit out there.

698
00:39:45,712 --> 00:39:48,030
Scott: Like you go to the east and there's just a hard container sitting out there.

699
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:50,947
Rym: It's like whoa, you're looking at you're trying to hit it with the boomerang.

700
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:54,540
Scott: Yeah And it's just crazy stuff.

701
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,550
Scott: and like you can just walk through walls and there's a hundred coins and all these.

702
00:39:57,751 --> 00:40:02,690
Scott: There's just so many things in the game that you'll stumble across that the game didn't tell you about.

703
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:04,750
Scott: So you feel like you really discovered something?

704
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:13,704
Scott: It's not like Metroid where you found a secret that you sort of had to find or they there's like, you know Basically big glaring shiny things that say secret here.

705
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:14,949
Scott: You need an item to get it.

706
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,270
Scott: You know, it's like you actually discovering like these completely hidden things.

707
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,670
Scott: It's like the same kind of feeling you get if you get the minus world and Mario Brothers.

708
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,169
Scott: It's like that's the feeling you get all over Zelda 1 no matter where you are.

709
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:28,550
Scott: It's like you get a red ring.

710
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,710
Scott: They didn't even tell you there was a fucking red ring, but you get it and you turn red.

711
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:33,570
Scott: It's like holy shit.

712
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,440
Scott: He turned red and now things barely hurt.

713
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,266
Rym: me though little known secret.

714
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:40,938
Rym: you get the red ring And that's why Zelda has a red dress on.

715
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,547
Rym: she'll be whatever color your ring is.

716
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:47,625
Scott: Yep Well, whatever color link is she'll match you right because there's only so many.

717
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,950
Rym: you must have a green ring on.

718
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,916
Rym: There's only have a red sword.

719
00:40:51,037 --> 00:40:54,890
Scott: There's only so many colors in the in the palette, you know, it's kind of had an argument.

720
00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:01,459
Rym: this is one of the epic arguments of the front row crew hanging out in colony back at RIT and You swore it was the wooden sword.

721
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,510
Rym: I did and I knew it was the red sword.

722
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,018
Rym: No, you didn't and we argued forever.

723
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:14,610
Rym: and finally I realized no we're arguing the whole front row crews there Yelling and we're kind of splitting the two camps red sword versus wood sword.

724
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:20,250
Rym: And finally, I remembered that I had the instruction book and I got it and I opened up to the page.

725
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,680
Scott: Could I just check the internet - and uh back then?

726
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,990
Rym: Yeah as we could have I think we poked around.

727
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,953
Rym: We didn't see anything obvious.

728
00:41:25,973 --> 00:41:26,555
Rym: Thanks.

729
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:28,101
Rym: We didn't trust the game facts.

730
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:29,927
Rym: We needed like a definitive source.

731
00:41:30,228 --> 00:41:32,881
Rym: Mm-hmm And it's not the master sword.

732
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:33,966
Rym: It's the magical sword.

733
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:39,225
Scott: I knew that Yep, and then the white sword which is just the white sword is basically the master.

734
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:40,730
Rym: So and then it's just sword.

735
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:44,177
Scott: Well, it's sword white sword magical.

736
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:44,438
Rym: Yes.

737
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:45,121
Rym: I've never.

738
00:41:45,442 --> 00:41:54,648
Scott: that was one of the most anticlimactic moments of my life You know, what always bothered me is how the magic sword It always it looked like a diagonal kind of thing right in the picture up top.

739
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:58,110
Scott: Yeah, but when you actually used it in game, it just stab straight.

740
00:41:58,672 --> 00:42:02,265
Scott: It didn't stab in any particular, you know, it wasn't diagonal like it was.

741
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:02,486
Scott: it was.

742
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:05,539
Rym: it was longer Made it look cool and mystical.

743
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:11,136
Scott: I don't know whatever it was weird but yeah Zelda 1 is is totally sweet.

744
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:16,616
Scott: and then it has a fucking second quest that the game doesn't tell you about and where everything is Totally fucked up and even more mystical.

745
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:17,759
Rym: Oh my god.

746
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:19,485
Rym: The second quest is actually really fun.

747
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:25,243
Rym: Yeah, and I got about One tenth of the way through Zelda see before I gave up.

748
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:26,187
Scott: Oh fuck Zelda.

749
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:28,358
Scott: see, you know I never beat the second question.

750
00:42:28,398 --> 00:42:31,698
Scott: I was a kid because we could never find level 8 and You know what.

751
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:33,530
Rym: now I wrote a letter to Nintendo power.

752
00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:37,890
Scott: Now that I know we're level 8 in the second quest is it's bullshit?

753
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:39,990
Rym: I beat the second quest legitimately.

754
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:47,112
Rym: The only thing that I didn't figure out was I actually couldn't find the fucking silver arrows in death mountain Really?

755
00:42:47,413 --> 00:42:50,061
Rym: So I sent a letter to Nintendo power.

756
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,024
Scott: Did you find level 8?

757
00:42:51,024 --> 00:42:56,098
Scott: level 8 is like there's no way you could find Nerd, I'd spent a lot of time playing.

758
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:57,263
Scott: There was no way.

759
00:42:57,363 --> 00:42:59,533
Scott: level 8 is just oh my gosh The scariest.

760
00:42:59,573 --> 00:43:03,251
Scott: I found level 9 but I couldn't get in cuz I didn't have the fragment from level 8.

761
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:07,063
Rym: You'd be easy to find later dungeons and hard to find earlier dungeons.

762
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,350
Rym: You go into later dungeons whiz robes ever that everywhere.

763
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,541
Rym: Yeah, right.

764
00:43:10,742 --> 00:43:15,903
Scott: Oh good But you go into a dungeon just like 10 mummies and you don't have anything.

765
00:43:15,923 --> 00:43:17,768
Scott: give dough to stab gibdo like 20 times.

766
00:43:19,274 --> 00:43:20,961
Rym: I always loved the gibdo who's got the key and him.

767
00:43:20,981 --> 00:43:25,782
Rym: you're like, all right, but the bombs in him Yeah, suicide bombing mommy gibdo except he didn't light it.

768
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,088
Scott: I know you put him in.

769
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:27,590
Rym: he wrapped up.

770
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,960
Scott: She should have lit it and jumped and just followed you.

771
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,196
Scott: really if any bad guy actually good AI and followed you and had a Bomb in them watch out.

772
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,060
Rym: I don't know.

773
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,365
Rym: some of the the Knights were.

774
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:39,530
Rym: the dark nights were a little hard to get.

775
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:46,841
Rym: The whistle felt so like powerful and the magic wand like.

776
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:51,316
Rym: I was so crazy excited to get it till I realized it was basically Just a white sword.

777
00:43:51,597 --> 00:43:56,343
Rym: Well, no what the magical wand allows you to do is a white sword And once you get the book it says the fire.

778
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:59,818
Scott: that's right It sets fire but it's like you won't use yours.

779
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:09,669
Scott: if you wanted projectiles without having to be fightful health Yeah, if these arrows which cost money, but if you have the magic wand, you can have a projectile at any time.

780
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,845
Rym: It's only a white sword projectile.

781
00:44:11,926 --> 00:44:18,909
Scott: That's true But it doesn't matter because you know It's still a projectile when you don't have full health and doesn't cost money like the arrow does.

782
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:20,436
Scott: So that's a good deal.

783
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,730
Rym: I just always laugh as a kid about pee hats.

784
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:32,063
Scott: You know painting for the door charge Laughed at that.

785
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,688
Scott: painting for the door pair.

786
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:35,293
Rym: Don't laugh at that cuz you're a kid.

787
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:36,658
Rym: I got my like 300 rupees.

788
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,100
Rym: I'm gonna buy that white ringer in the white ring the blue ring that door charge.

789
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,320
Scott: I swear to God know cuz he had a system as soon as you had enough for the blue ring you buy it.

790
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,991
Scott: You don't stop anywhere cuz you know, the door charge might be lurking.

791
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:49,958
Rym: I didn't know I'd never run into it.

792
00:44:51,302 --> 00:44:51,684
Rym: Think about it.

793
00:44:51,704 --> 00:44:52,127
Rym: You don't know.

794
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,460
Rym: there's no way for you to know if you've never found it.

795
00:44:55,466 --> 00:44:57,720
Scott: I guess there was a time when I got fucked by it.

796
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,160
Scott: But you know what?

797
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,756
Scott: You can just push the reset button and you go back to you save and you're good now.

798
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:02,560
Rym: now you don't do that.

799
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:02,987
Scott: Why not?

800
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:03,660
Rym: you don't do that?

801
00:45:06,362 --> 00:45:08,753
Scott: You got to do that especially in a game that's a jerk like this.

802
00:45:09,135 --> 00:45:14,574
Scott: if you don't know what you're doing I mean you got to use every advantage you can get to uncover the secrets.

803
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:16,399
Rym: I do feel like they're.

804
00:45:16,419 --> 00:45:19,037
Rym: you know Flipping through this instruction book that I'm holding my hands yet again.

805
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:24,659
Rym: Anyone who's gonna play Zelda 1 today read the instruction book like literally read every.

806
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:34,520
Scott: yeah I mean you don't want to use game facts because that ruins all the mystical parts because you basically know you would already know Everything and I guess you kind of don't want to spend time burning every bush like I did.

807
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,250
Rym: But I guess you don't need to burn every bush because you can.

808
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:44,420
Rym: that the bushes that have stuff that really matters They're the bushes that are kind of standing out like a sore thumb.

809
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,316
Scott: Yeah, like oh I went on this screen and there's a bunch of bushes and there's one bush out on its own.

810
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:49,239
Scott: Huh?

811
00:45:50,062 --> 00:45:54,600
Scott: And make sure you get the red candle so you can actually burn that's way later in the game and I don't wanted money now.

812
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:58,092
Scott: Yeah, well the if you use the blue candle you're gonna be walking back and forth.

813
00:45:58,453 --> 00:45:59,858
Scott: burn a bush didn't do anything.

814
00:45:59,898 --> 00:46:01,686
Scott: leave the screen Come back burn a bush.

815
00:46:01,847 --> 00:46:02,390
Rym: It was worth it.

816
00:46:02,812 --> 00:46:03,395
Rym: I found that money.

817
00:46:03,415 --> 00:46:06,004
Scott: Yeah But yeah, you gotta.

818
00:46:06,025 --> 00:46:09,300
Scott: you gotta have at least some hints which are the hints that the book provides for you.

819
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,072
Scott: You know the beginning map area location of level one, right.

820
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,700
Scott: without that you're and you just try to play from nothing.

821
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:18,633
Scott: It's gonna be pretty impossible and frustrating.

822
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:25,792
Rym: but if you have the book I mean the one thing I will say is as a kid I beat this game Like not that without that man.

823
00:46:25,812 --> 00:46:33,128
Scott: when I beat this game was so epic Like I had some friends were over and they were watching and the first time I beat it I thought that you had to use the silver arrow only.

824
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:35,056
Scott: so I beat Gannon using only silver arrow.

825
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:36,743
Rym: and no so really I did The same thing.

826
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:43,202
Scott: Yeah, and then later it was like no dude, you can just use sword You only to use silver arrow after he turns red Spoiler.

827
00:46:43,463 --> 00:46:45,809
Rym: I guess I don't think there's spoilers for that.

828
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:46,832
Scott: You don't think so.

829
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:50,000
Scott: Nah, I wonder is Gannon any harder in the second quest?

830
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:50,867
Rym: I don't know.

831
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:52,620
Rym: I got the once I got the silver arrows.

832
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,389
Rym: The only thing that really Gannon was a lot easier.

833
00:46:55,429 --> 00:47:00,425
Rym: those fucking petros all over death mountain petros are easy, dude Not in the second quest.

834
00:47:00,606 --> 00:47:01,650
Rym: other different their heart.

835
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,433
Rym: They take more hits.

836
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:03,337
Scott: Oh fucker.

837
00:47:03,438 --> 00:47:06,289
Rym: Yeah Plus petro with wiz robes in the room.

838
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:08,277
Rym: Oh god, fuck that blue ones.

839
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:11,351
Scott: Oh Nothing's harder than blue wiz robe.

840
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:12,360
Rym: fucking blue wiz robe.

841
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,868
Scott: I mean people are complaining about like blue night.

842
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,138
Scott: You can be blue night with friggin magic sword and bomb.

843
00:47:18,398 --> 00:47:18,860
Rym: Oh my god.

844
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:40,600
Rym: I remember you can get into like the back way of the later dungeon to get the book But I would always bust into like a later dungeon to get the magic key and I'd go in there with like a white sword Maybe not even the white sword and just like try desperately to get through the game to get the magic key Never to deal with bullshit getting keys for the whole rest of the game.

845
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:44,360
Scott: I like how like there are things that are not, you know, they're optional items, you know.

846
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,271
Scott: It's not like you need to get the item to beat the level.

847
00:47:47,311 --> 00:48:03,041
Scott: nowadays right the way the Zelda games are structured It's like you got to get the item and without that item There is no way you can get the big key and you need the big key to go to the boss in the old Zelda's like you just go straight to the boss Kill him with the red sword, you know kill him with the arrow, you know You don't.

848
00:48:03,061 --> 00:48:04,489
Scott: even you could do the the sword list.

849
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,520
Rym: I kill a lot of the Knights with bombs.

850
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:07,643
Scott: Yeah, right.

851
00:48:07,663 --> 00:48:09,272
Scott: It's like you can just do your own thing.

852
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:10,740
Scott: You don't need to get the items.

853
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:14,032
Rym: Yeah, you know like you need the raft you need the ladder to get to some you could.

854
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:17,418
Scott: you could neglect to get the bow in level one.

855
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:24,668
Scott: Go all the way to the end of the game get the silver arrow go to Ganon and then be unable to kill him Because you don't you cannot have the bow.

856
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:26,094
Rym: Yeah, you don't need the magic boomerang.

857
00:48:26,496 --> 00:48:27,520
Rym: Yeah, I love that magic.

858
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,872
Scott: You don't need the regular boomerang.

859
00:48:28,892 --> 00:48:29,578
Scott: You can just skip it.

860
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:37,272
Rym: Yeah, the only things that you need to the compasses in the maps and the letter to the little old lady Yeah, it actually says letter to little old lady.

861
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,947
Scott: in the book you could you could basically Ignore.

862
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:54,464
Scott: like the vast majority of the game all you need to do to actually make it through the game is kill the bosses somehow with bomb, you know with something see or well, and you get the Triforce pieces behind them and That's it.

863
00:48:54,544 --> 00:48:57,500
Rym: I mean, well, I mean I bet you'd like to carry more bombs.

864
00:48:57,781 --> 00:48:58,464
Scott: I bet you would.

865
00:48:58,484 --> 00:49:00,191
Rym: you're gonna give up a heart container.

866
00:49:00,693 --> 00:49:02,280
Scott: No, that's that man.

867
00:49:02,822 --> 00:49:03,345
Scott: Take anyone.

868
00:49:03,385 --> 00:49:04,953
Scott: you want red potion heart container.

869
00:49:04,973 --> 00:49:08,485
Scott: I mean seriously Seriously, what kid?

870
00:49:08,786 --> 00:49:12,540
Rym: I watched my friend Joe fucking Ogilvy take the red boat.

871
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,485
Rym: He took the red potion.

872
00:49:13,525 --> 00:49:14,309
Scott: just punch him in the face.

873
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,200
Rym: I was like what is wrong with you?

874
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,247
Rym: He's like red potion takes a lot of money.

875
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:19,994
Rym: and I was like I was like.

876
00:49:20,034 --> 00:49:22,760
Rym: you realize there's no other way to get that heart container ever.

877
00:49:23,642 --> 00:49:24,689
Rym: You just fucked it.

878
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:27,285
Rym: I Don't think I said fucked it.

879
00:49:27,386 --> 00:49:30,000
Scott: He's obviously that person is not going far in life.

880
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:32,813
Rym: I don't know what I knew him when I was in like.

881
00:49:33,255 --> 00:49:34,280
Scott: he's working a gas station.

882
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,704
Rym: That's why I went to Catholic school.

883
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,107
Rym: We lived in downtown Detroit.

884
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:39,914
Scott: people with full heart containers get get salaried real jobs.

885
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,988
Rym: I Would often beat the game without full heart containers.

886
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:46,600
Scott: Oh, yeah, I guess early on, you know.

887
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,853
Scott: But now I know where they're all are.

888
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:49,785
Rym: So Would you play Zelda like?

889
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:51,433
Rym: do you feel like you should play Zelda 1 again?

890
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:52,015
Rym: Like now?

891
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:54,887
Scott: I've played it recently How recently pretty reason.

892
00:49:54,907 --> 00:49:55,570
Scott: less than a year ago.

893
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:57,317
Rym: I burned through Zelda 2 not that long ago.

894
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:00,705
Rym: I burned through Zelda 3 recently.

895
00:50:00,826 --> 00:50:02,069
Scott: Zelda 2 is a little more painful.

896
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:04,176
Rym: I like Zelda 2 a lot.

897
00:50:04,196 --> 00:50:05,600
Scott: You're the only one good game.

898
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:08,324
Scott: It's all that he sucks But it doesn't suck.

899
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:15,107
Scott: but it's you know one thing so much more painful than any of the others one thing Zelda 1 Does not have.

900
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:23,840
Rym: that is good that Zelda 2 has The epic the single epic journey to get that motherfucking hammer good.

901
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:31,819
Rym: Just the feeling everyone every kid I knew Like everyone had gotten to the point of I gotta go get the hammer and no one could get it.

902
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,484
Rym: Do you believe tonight?

903
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:34,648
Rym: I got a plan.

904
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:36,716
Rym: I think I know where the hammer is.

905
00:50:36,736 --> 00:50:37,900
Rym: I'm gonna try and get it.

906
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,197
Rym: There was no game facts back then.

907
00:50:39,712 --> 00:50:43,737
Scott: No You need you need a little map to get through all those caves and every cave you go in.

908
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:50,342
Scott: that's unnecessary Cost you health and you got to use the magic and no kid was gonna tell anyone else the pads He'd found.

909
00:50:50,362 --> 00:50:53,800
Rym: that got him closer to the hammer because he wanted to get it before everybody else got it.

910
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,928
Scott: Yep And the thing is the thing that always hurt me is I would.

911
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:03,160
Scott: I played these Zelda games at other people's systems with other people's Carches before I played them on my own system.

912
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:19,139
Scott: So what happened was I would I would always like have the hammer already or have stuff already and I wouldn't really know You know where to go or what to do next because I was in the middle of someone else's game And it wasn't until I got them on my own that I really knew what was going on.

913
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:24,700
Scott: I mean the game even had a mystical quality in the gold cartridge, right?

914
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,512
Rym: Yeah, there were only two gold cartridges and one silver cartridge.

915
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:30,839
Rym: Zelda and Zelda 2 were the gold ones.

916
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:33,146
Scott: Yeah, it's like no other game had that.

917
00:51:33,186 --> 00:51:39,845
Scott: so it's like it felt like some sort of magical and special game and it kind of was Probably still the best game.

918
00:51:39,865 --> 00:51:43,080
Scott: I know it was the best game ever, but it's definitely one of the best games ever.

919
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,127
Rym: It's an important game.

920
00:51:44,228 --> 00:51:46,000
Rym: I feel like there's still a lot to learn from Zelda.

921
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,912
Rym: I feel like it for someone who's never played it before.

922
00:51:48,932 --> 00:51:51,000
Rym: it is well worth playing.

923
00:51:51,645 --> 00:51:53,320
Rym: Of course Emily now is going through that transition.

924
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,692
Rym: I mean she's playing it, you know, she's played the new Zelda plays.

925
00:51:55,772 --> 00:51:58,424
Scott: I'm like she played Zelda 1 not yet But she's playing Zelda 3.

926
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:01,695
Rym: All right, cuz that's that's a more accessible Zelda.

927
00:52:01,715 --> 00:52:07,052
Rym: I think than Zelda 1. definitely It's easy to forget how balls hard that game is.

928
00:52:07,092 --> 00:52:14,160
Rym: if you were not awesome at video games Super Nintendo Zelda is not really that hard for someone who's not awesome at video games.

929
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:15,808
Rym: It's pretty awesome video games.

930
00:52:15,848 --> 00:52:16,994
Scott: Mario one's gonna be hard.

931
00:52:17,055 --> 00:52:19,787
Rym: I mean, come on How many people have beaten Mario 1?

932
00:52:19,787 --> 00:52:22,660
Rym: I'll bet if we go to PAX and we're like how many people in this room have?

933
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:32,837
Rym: Actually beaten Mario 1 maybe sadly surprised The same number of people who watched Evangelion at the anime convention or people who hadn't seen Star Wars.

934
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:38,924
Scott: Yeah God, we're old Yeah, but actually it's like I'd.

935
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:44,803
Scott: you know what I bet most people at a gaming at any convention have not played Zelda 1.

936
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:45,286
Scott: I'm beating it.

937
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:51,280
Rym: Yeah, I guess even I guess Zelda 2 until RIT when I announced it.

938
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:54,880
Scott: Oh, I thought you said that you beat it before that you're just beating again at RIT.

939
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,475
Rym: No, I'd gotten up to the Thunderbird not past.

940
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:00,984
Scott: Oh Well, then How about that?

941
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:02,312
Rym: Yeah, you'd ever beat it.

942
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:11,454
Rym: I beat it when I forget, uh-huh You fight the shadow link and then you wait All right, who else is standing on the screen after you fight the shadow link?

943
00:53:11,475 --> 00:53:12,218
Rym: like who talks to you?

944
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,187
Rym: I Think we're petering out here.

945
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:22,574
Rym: This is kind of a lazy show.

946
00:53:22,594 --> 00:53:23,700
Rym: I'll be honest.

947
00:53:24,063 --> 00:53:28,870
Scott: Yeah, the point is that Zelda 1 is awesome and like if you haven't played Zelda 1 seriously what?

948
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:36,836
Scott: and plus I because I just know in my heart that a Scarily small number of people have played Zelda 1 and a scarily even smaller number have beaten it.

949
00:53:36,896 --> 00:53:38,301
Rym: go find a scan to the instruction Book.

950
00:53:38,321 --> 00:53:41,435
Rym: scout look at this cute link just kind of standing there like the instruction book.

951
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:42,380
Scott: art was so great.

952
00:53:42,821 --> 00:53:48,960
Rym: Oh my gosh, and if only there had been a Zelda anime that was just the anime looking art from this book.

953
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,158
Rym: Excuse me artist.

954
00:53:54,901 --> 00:54:02,360
