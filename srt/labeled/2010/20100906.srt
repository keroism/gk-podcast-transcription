1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,967
Scott: It's Monday September 6th.

2
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:11,630
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,352
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:14,058
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:18,004
Scott: Tonight we interview Mark O'Sullivan of Vanilla Forums.

6
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:22,650
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:31,004
Rym: Man, we're finally back from PAX.

8
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:31,809
Scott: No we're not.

9
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:32,150
Scott: Yeah we are.

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:32,894
Scott: We need to go to PAX.

11
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:36,128
Scott: Alright name for me one awesome thing that happened at PAX 2010.

12
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:39,804
Rym: The Friday night PAX Late Show was totally awesome.

13
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:40,327
Rym: What happened?

14
00:00:40,347 --> 00:00:40,930
Rym: We had John St.

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,654
Rym: John as the guest.

16
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,101
Scott: Alright name one thing he said.

17
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:48,133
Rym: He said it's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum and I'm all out of gum.

18
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:49,015
Scott: Name one thing.

19
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,587
Scott: he said that you could not possibly predict that he would say.

20
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:56,884
Rym: You realize this is flawed because whatever I say I could go back in time and have him say it.

21
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:05,242
Scott: You mean go forward in time and have him say it.

22
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:06,870
Rym: So PAX was awesome.

23
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:09,342
Rym: We did our two panels and we did the Late Show.

24
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:10,588
Rym: and if any of you are new listeners.

25
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:14,429
Scott: You know you're chasing it because you know we're gonna fail to do them somehow.

26
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:20,162
Rym: And then these people are gonna be coming you know today after PAX to hear about it because they found out about us from the Late Show.

27
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:20,905
Scott: Yeah I know it's.

28
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:21,106
Scott: it's.

29
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:22,553
Scott: it's still August 30th.

30
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:26,288
Rym: No it's Monday September 6th anyway.

31
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:27,110
Rym: Labor Day.

32
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:28,415
Scott: The listeners know.

33
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:29,237
Rym: No they don't.

34
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:31,691
Scott: I don't need to continue to fight for them to know the truth.

35
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:38,463
Rym: The truth that you for some reason decided like in the fourth take of this to continue to insist that it's still before PAX.

36
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:41,813
Scott: It's not even necessary.

37
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:42,615
Scott: everybody knows it.

38
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:47,097
Rym: You know it'll be really funny if like that hurricane prevents us from flying to PAX.

39
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,665
Scott: I don't think it's gonna.

40
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:49,347
Rym: I don't think it will.

41
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:53,063
Rym: So it is Monday before we got to get into this interview.

42
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:54,934
Rym: pretty quick cuz I think it's gonna be pretty fun.

43
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:56,381
Rym: so what you got?

44
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:57,667
Scott: Oh we want to do some news.

45
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:58,711
Rym: Yeah it is Monday.

46
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:02,185
Rym: So the least done GeekNights' night in a while.

47
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:06,259
Scott: Yeah so you know AMD bought ATI a while ago.

48
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:06,901
Scott: That they did.

49
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:07,623
Scott: That they did.

50
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:18,444
Scott: and now the news is out that not only did they buy ATI which they was done a long time ago but now they're actually gonna destroy the ATI brand.

51
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,151
Rym: That was expected.

52
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,698
Scott: So now you're gonna buy it.

53
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:22,260
Scott: it's still gonna.

54
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,815
Scott: they're still gonna keep around like Radeon and shit.

55
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:26,443
Scott: they're just gonna not call it ATI.

56
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:29,455
Scott: so it's gonna be an AMD Radeon video card.

57
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:30,479
Rym: I have nothing.

58
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,953
Rym: I mean I think it's a great plan from their perspective.

59
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:34,462
Rym: it'll just solidify the AMD brand.

60
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:38,038
Rym: why bother also marketing this ATI that no one's gonna remember.

61
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:38,781
Scott: I think it'll.

62
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:47,782
Scott: I think it'll really cut down on people buying AMD CPUs with Nvidia GPUs because it's like they really try to emphasize that fusion thing they have going on.

63
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:48,525
Scott: Yeah.

64
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:58,609
Scott: You know and then so you're gonna buy the AMD set as opposed like Intel and Nvidia which still kind of hate each other but they really should team up with each other for their own benefit.

65
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:06,184
Rym: It is also definitely kind of a sign that they're going to probably move more and more toward crazy integrations.

66
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:12,474
Rym: I mean I could really foresee them eventually selling like GPUs, CPU, motherboard, combo all in one.

67
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:13,960
Scott: That is one thing I never understood.

68
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:26,946
Scott: right is like okay you're putting these integrated GPUs into the CPU right why don't you just remove the PCI x16 slot from the motherboard in that same space just put the GPU right on the motherboard.

69
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:28,250
Scott: So here's the real one.

70
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:37,083
Rym: Here's because video card technology moves a lot faster than the rest and now you can upgrade.

71
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:38,789
Scott: It's true.

72
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:41,217
Scott: well you could upgrade if they also put the slot.

73
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:46,342
Scott: then you could deactivate the one on the motherboard and put a new one in the slot.

74
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,267
Rym: That's like we do now.

75
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,782
Scott: The thing is the vast majority of people don't want to upgrade.

76
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:55,466
Rym: It depends though the people who buy an AMD who know to buy a particular motherboard.

77
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,335
Scott: That's true that's true.

78
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:58,641
Rym: I mean normal people don't know.

79
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,083
Rym: they don't care.

80
00:03:59,103 --> 00:03:59,867
Rym: they go buy a Dell.

81
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,198
Scott: Yeah but you know right does Dell?

82
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,671
Scott: even people like I have an AMD option nowadays.

83
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:07,304
Rym: Even people like us buy a Dell half the time now.

84
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,128
Scott: Yeah.

85
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:18,012
Rym: I mean I built my computer from scratch because I had some requirements and I could have gotten pretty much the same thing from like Dell or someone for pretty much the same money.

86
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:25,129
Scott: The problem is people always when they go to Dell or whoever they always look at the consumer models or they look at the gaming model.

87
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,562
Rym: Oh I wish I could buy the ones I've got at work at home.

88
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:29,675
Scott: Yeah you're supposed to look at the business models.

89
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:34,358
Scott: Any company that pre-builds computers the only good ones are the business models like Lenovo.

90
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,515
Scott: all the business class Thinkpads are awesome and everything else sucks.

91
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:40,087
Scott: Dell the Optiplex is the business ones.

92
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:40,990
Scott: those are pretty good.

93
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,446
Rym: I wouldn't say every other Lenovo sucks though they're actually pretty good.

94
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:47,261
Scott: We get the idea pad the cheap plastic piece of crap.

95
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:47,964
Rym: It's not that bad.

96
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:48,526
Scott: It's pretty bad.

97
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,772
Rym: Verge price point not that bad.

98
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:50,615
Scott: It's pretty bad.

99
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:52,524
Scott: I would not buy one.

100
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:55,401
Rym: Name another laptop that competes with it at that price point.

101
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,494
Scott: What do you mean at the same price?

102
00:04:58,554 --> 00:05:00,965
Rym: Yeah like at the same price can you get a better laptop elsewhere?

103
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:03,339
Scott: You can't get a good laptop for that price is the point.

104
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,630
Rym: So why not get the best one at that price?

105
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:06,314
Scott: Don't get any.

106
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:08,706
Rym: What if you don't have enough money but you need a laptop?

107
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:09,912
Rym: It's not that bad.

108
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:10,435
Scott: Don't get it.

109
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:16,095
Scott: It's gonna break and you're actually gonna end up spending more money in the long run than if you would have bought a good one in the first place.

110
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,085
Scott: They're not that unreliable.

111
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:33,512
Scott: Everyone I ever known who has bought the lower-end laptops has always had them cracking and breaking and all kinds of troubles and the only people I know who have laptops that are reliable are Apple people who spend too much money and people who buy the high quality.

112
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:40,187
Rym: I've actually found the people I know who have apples tend to have problems that require them to get it replaced by Apple fairly frequently.

113
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:46,445
Scott: Well those are people who are just you know they're gonna break whatever computer give them because they drop it or kick it or do stupid crap to it.

114
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,676
Rym: I remember I knew one person no no names.

115
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:54,582
Rym: who would leave an Apple MacBook kind of cracked open with the speakers on to play music in the shower.

116
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,092
Scott: Yeah that is a bad idea.

117
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:59,201
Rym: That one I don't think actually broke from that though.

118
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:00,105
Scott: Did it break?

119
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:01,110
Rym: Eventually.

120
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,320
Rym: I think it was an unrelated physical defect.

121
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,664
Scott: Okay good job.

122
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:09,101
Scott: Unless I hope that's a real cold shower because the humidity is gonna.

123
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,205
Guest: No no no no no.

124
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:11,690
Scott: Okay.

125
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,861
Rym: So I mean I guess we'll have to wait and see how this pans out.

126
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:21,537
Rym: There's no other news than yeah they're destroying the ATI brand and I didn't even see a lot of fanboy like craziness about it.

127
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:24,252
Scott: Well because I don't think fanboys really care about the name so much.

128
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:26,303
Rym: Now had they changed it from Radeon to something else.

129
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:27,147
Scott: They care about the benchmarks.

130
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:33,845
Rym: I think those fanboys might have got a little mad but I wouldn't be surprised if in the long run they dropped the Radeon brand and have some brand new brand.

131
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:36,456
Scott: Well you know they look they they already have.

132
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,749
Scott: they're just using the existing ones right.

133
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,364
Scott: The thing that is interesting is that are keeping the red color.

134
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:46,284
Scott: they're not changing it to green right which am because then it'll be green vs green AMD vs Nvidia.

135
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,146
Scott: No it'll be Christmas.

136
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:49,812
Scott: Anyway.

137
00:06:51,937 --> 00:07:01,713
Rym: So I've got an article here and it's interesting because say that I think people who are old in IT and computer science are discriminated against in the job force.

138
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:03,383
Rym: There's a million articles pointed out that.

139
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,844
Rym: yes in fact if you're over 40 you're not gonna get hired for IT or CS.

140
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:17,131
Rym: but if I decide the exact opposite that young people are being discriminated against there's the same number of articles saying that no one hires the inexperienced out of college people.

141
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:17,613
Scott: That's true.

142
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,387
Rym: I'm pretty sure that no one hires anyone at this point.

143
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,285
Scott: No Pete there is one kind of person that's hired.

144
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:29,464
Rym: 24 single no prospects of a relationship family or future willing to work 60 hours.

145
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,630
Scott: Well that that helps.

146
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:31,917
Scott: but I mean it's pretty much it's.

147
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:32,882
Scott: they don't vary.

148
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:38,448
Scott: only certain places you know and not enough of them will hire the completely inexperienced college person.

149
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:53,906
Scott: right but as soon as the person goes to one of those places if they manage to get there then they can get a real job at a place and then they can have real jobs for a certain period of time until they're old and their skills are washed out and then it's hard for them to get jobs if they lose it again.

150
00:07:54,448 --> 00:08:03,304
Scott: but what you have to do in that time is like you know go out on your own or become a fancy consultant or become so awesome in some way that you're gonna be alright.

151
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:04,106
Scott: If you don't elevate.

152
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,189
Scott: If you don't elevate.

153
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:06,732
Rym: If you're 40, 50 it's gonna be tough.

154
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:11,309
Rym: Even if you're awesome I'll be honest.

155
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,689
Rym: I don't think people hire older people because they know they can get more out of a younger person.

156
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:24,999
Scott: You have to elevate during the short time that you have to do something bigger like being a manager or something you know maybe a something it's got to be something besides the low-end guy.

157
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,013
Scott: you can't be the low-end guy after you're that old.

158
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:27,879
Scott: you got to be working out.

159
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,825
Rym: Well actually here's the thing.

160
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:35,200
Rym: it just at least in my experience and having worked you know for three big iron companies and never worked anywhere small ever.

161
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:45,789
Rym: this article I bring it up for the news partly because it talks about this kind of ageism problem where young and old people in technology I think are discriminated against often unfairly.

162
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:56,812
Rym: I mean very young people have tons of awesome knowledge like they know whatever is hip and current now usually at least if they went to a good school or they're really motivated but companies won't really hire them because they want.

163
00:08:56,832 --> 00:09:00,170
Rym: you know they always say like I want five years of experience with this thing.

164
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,616
Rym: that's only existed for three years.

165
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:03,506
Rym: but that's the real problem.

166
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:06,400
Rym: there is that non tech people write the job listings.

167
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:10,997
Rym: so the real advice is ignore experience requirements and apply anyway.

168
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:12,302
Scott: yeah I don't you know.

169
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:16,845
Rym: I think that in fact don't lie but count college years as experience.

170
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:18,112
Scott: I think the thing is is that just.

171
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:20,403
Scott: yeah a lot of people are scared away.

172
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:22,211
Scott: they're like afraid to apply.

173
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:29,278
Scott: if you're looking for a job in technology or anything else right just look at if it sounds like a job that you want.

174
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:32,214
Scott: don't look at the requirements don't look at any of that bullshit.

175
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:36,033
Scott: right just if it sounds like a job and that's the job you want apply.

176
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,323
Scott: it doesn't cost anything to apply.

177
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:39,731
Scott: if it does don't apply no matter what.

178
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:49,218
Rym: oh I would argue if you have if you live in some barbaric place like Australia where you have to pay for your bandwidth in a metered way it costs to send that email a very negligible.

179
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:52,154
Scott: the point is it doesn't cost anything to apply.

180
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:56,256
Scott: so even if you don't meet the requirements at all like you're not even close apply anyway.

181
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:56,979
Scott: what's the worst?

182
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,847
Scott: they can do not email you back.

183
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:02,722
Scott: oh no they didn't email me back at the end of the world.

184
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:05,692
Scott: listen just email it doesn't hurt do it.

185
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,678
Scott: and then something you know.

186
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:12,565
Scott: maybe they're probably I imagine if they have stupid requirements they're not getting that many emails.

187
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:13,831
Scott: so the competition will be light.

188
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:19,498
Scott: if nil and they might call you back they might why not you know and they're pretty much it pretty.

189
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:27,875
Scott: it comes down to whether are you desperate for a job any job then freaking shotgun you know boom blast your resume all over the place so you get a job.

190
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:28,719
Rym: spam it though.

191
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,026
Scott: no no no just you know.

192
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,257
Rym: you know those people who actually spam.

193
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:32,941
Rym: you gotta do that.

194
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:34,130
Scott: it's a shotgun you can't just go.

195
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,057
Scott: doom doom doom doom doom.

196
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:36,909
Scott: you got to get one shot and hit the clay pigeon.

197
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:43,157
Rym: yeah but don't email like the operations number of a company and say I have an h1b and I know Java.

198
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:45,004
Rym: please hire me to do your Java project.

199
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:47,514
Rym: how many emails those I get every single day?

200
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:50,809
Rym: they're almost always the same email just with a different name.

201
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:53,400
Scott: but if you are you know.

202
00:10:53,581 --> 00:11:04,256
Scott: if you can if you got money and you you don't need a job right away and you're good job and you're willing to stay at home and do nothing until you find the good job then you can get your sniper rifle out right and just go

203
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:05,944
Rym: metaphorical sniper rifle.

204
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:07,130
Rym: don't go shoot anyone no.

205
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:10,105
Rym: but here's why I want to link to this article and I think it's worth.

206
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:14,369
Rym: I think a show on ageism might be worth doing later but this article.

207
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:28,172
Rym: every time you see an article that talks about like how to fight ageism and how to like how to get a job in tech if you're over 40 or nowadays over 30 they always say you know be really current in your skills and be able to demonstrate it and that's BS.

208
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:38,157
Rym: this article says what I would say if you want to still be relevant when you're getting into your 40s and 50s and you're an IT or a CS guy I'm just gonna quote the quote from slashdot.

209
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,735
Rym: one move up the ladder into management architecture or design.

210
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:47,477
Rym: do not stay at just coding or IT because there's basically no future in those.

211
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:55,492
Rym: no matter how old you are - if you're going to stay in programming realize that the is stacked against you and deal with that.

212
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:59,129
Rym: three actually keep your skills current actually current.

213
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,158
Rym: know what people are actually doing.

214
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:07,591
Rym: I mean if you're if you want to get a job now in like web or something and you can't do pretty much any common framework.

215
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:09,882
Rym: just off the drop of a hat you're already screwed.

216
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:16,393
Scott: yeah unless you want to get one of those like enterprise Tomcat Java I mean yeah it also depends on what you want to like.

217
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:22,306
Scott: if I want to work in finance I had to go learn a bunch of crap I don't know like Java's or dot nets or something you know.

218
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,947
Scott: it's like you got to aim for the industry where your skill set is gonna work out.

219
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:37,598
Rym: yep but I think the most important advice is really you've got to move up and to the side into management architecture or into sales into product management into consulting into project management.

220
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:39,445
Scott: you said project management two times.

221
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,733
Scott: yes you can also.

222
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:48,063
Scott: another good idea is if you learn an additional skill like you keep all your technology skills way current and awesome.

223
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:50,274
Scott: but you also have some other skill.

224
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:55,983
Rym: that's like finance or medicine or biology because holy crap you realize like bioinformatics or anything like.

225
00:12:56,023 --> 00:13:01,627
Scott: that is the hot shit right now or even like even something stupid like sports or fucking.

226
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,278
Scott: you know liquor store managing or you know anything.

227
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:11,767
Scott: you can combine the technology skills with your skills and the thing is most people have the other skill set.

228
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:19,406
Scott: don't know anything about technology so you can make a product or you know find an existing business and really help it out or who knows what you can do.

229
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,683
Rym: but most people who know tech only know tech professionally.

230
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:24,333
Rym: or if they know something else they don't think that

231
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:27,229
Scott: or they're in tech but they don't really know - yeah

232
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:37,494
Rym: but one of the most important like things on a resume is if you know like someone who knows IT and something else you will basically have perfect job insurance forever.

233
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:44,182
Rym: law laws a good one yeah plus imagine a world where the lawyers were also able to do their own IT.

234
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:47,957
Rym: that and the doctor understood why Firefox was better than IE.

235
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:55,264
Scott: that's yeah that's okay but I think the real thing we need is we need the judges and that's gonna be much more different.

236
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:08,089
Rym: so moving right along to get into everything it's time for the things of the day.

237
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:09,957
Scott: oh no thing of the day.

238
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:12,146
Rym: I got sick of saying things of the day.

239
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,693
Rym: I wanted to mix it up all right whatever.

240
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:18,594
Scott: so you know the one of the most famous supercomputers to ever exist was the cray.

241
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:23,379
Scott: and you know people back in the day used to be like oh my god cray cray dad cray fish.

242
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,869
Scott: no just cray the cray supercomputer cray.

243
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:27,797
Scott: why are you being stupid anyway?

244
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:36,320
Scott: so the thing with the cray is that it was sort of I don't know it was real famous and it was real impressive looking like it's if you've ever if you've never seen one.

245
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,208
Scott: it's like a big cylinder right with a hole in the middle and then it actually has like a bench around it.

246
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:42,012
Scott: you know it's like.

247
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:49,074
Scott: you know the idea was that you would have it there and they could the programmers and sort of sit next to it thinking and then they would go over to the terminal and coat.

248
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:57,214
Scott: you know and this is like an ancient relic of computing but it was very important you know to the world and specifically to the u.s.

249
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:59,346
Scott: where you know the government bought a whole bunch of them back in the day.

250
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:04,327
Scott: your computer now though is way faster than a crazy for computer at least the first cray.

251
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,779
Scott: but anyway the thing is some guy.

252
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:19,743
Scott: he made a model of cray one the very first cray supercomputer and it's not a full size model it's much smaller than the original but it is very very accurate to the original.

253
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:20,928
Scott: so it's like a little tiny cray.

254
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:22,133
Scott: could you know sit in a room?

255
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:25,206
Scott: but he went one step beyond that.

256
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,272
Scott: you know what step beyond that.

257
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:27,739
Scott: he went to what he do.

258
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,714
Scott: he took an FPGA and he made it binary compatible with the cray one.

259
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:43,891
Scott: so if anyone doesn't know an FPGA is right basically what it is it's it's a it's a chip right and you it's a chip that you can reprogram.

260
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:45,717
Scott: so you can.

261
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:52,351
Scott: let's say I have it's it's a. I think it's like a something programmable gate array right fully programmable gate array something like that.

262
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:55,869
Scott: but the way it works is let's say I have like a penny of one right.

263
00:15:56,392 --> 00:16:00,454
Scott: well I can do is I can just I can make if I have a penny of one it's a penny of one.

264
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:01,158
Scott: that's all it is.

265
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,440
Scott: you can never change field programmable gate array field programmable gate array got to him.

266
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,865
Scott: I was so close anyway.

267
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,764
Scott: but if you have an FPGA right you can change it into different chips like.

268
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,110
Scott: I could turn the FPGA.

269
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,759
Scott: it's like an and gate a big ol.

270
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:17,875
Scott: and Kate I could turn it into a penny in one if it's big enough.

271
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:20,591
Scott: you know I could turn it into a penny in two if it's big enough.

272
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:24,672
Scott: I could turn it into a honey in three if it's big and I can turn it into like a power PC.

273
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:26,179
Scott: or or I could turn.

274
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,998
Scott: I could turn it into the same chip that your cell phone has in it.

275
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,812
Scott: you know I could turn it into any chip I needed to turn into.

276
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:34,344
Scott: I just have to program it to to be that.

277
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:36,516
Scott: now why don't we use FPGAs and computers?

278
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,862
Rym: well they're not as efficient.

279
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:42,485
Scott: yeah they're not as it's not as fast as you know the the chip you have in your computer.

280
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:54,762
Scott: so having an actual Pentium 2 is a lot better than having a FPGA program to be a Pentium 2. also you know it's hard to get an FPGA has to have enough stuff in it and or you know if it's not big enough or it doesn't have enough.

281
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,889
Scott: you know things in it.

282
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,448
Scott: if there might not be possible for it to you know turn into certain chip plus.

283
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:04,894
Rym: imagine the malware you could write if you were able to hack someone's computer that ran on these things.

284
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:08,253
Scott: oh god yeah you could just switch someone's chip into doing something else.

285
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:10,144
Scott: good god yeah you don't want to you.

286
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:12,939
Scott: mostly these are used for developing and stuff like that.

287
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,521
Scott: you know so.

288
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:19,551
Scott: but this guy he took one and how is he gonna get a crate the hardware for a Cray one right there was no way he could do it.

289
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,396
Scott: that'd be so difficult.

290
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:32,240
Scott: so but we could do is he could get the documentation for a Cray one to see how it works and then you could take an FPGA and program it to be exactly the same as the Cray one you know and you could do this for any sort of chip.

291
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,743
Scott: that's like missing in the world like you could make an NES out of one or you know whatever you need.

292
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:40,923
Scott: so that's what he did and he put it inside the model of a Cray one.

293
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:44,464
Scott: and it's all and there's a whole bunch of pictures and everything and it's way awesome.

294
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:56,786
Rym: so you all know at PAX this past weekend we did the late show I mean PAX this next weekend and we had you know theoretically some sort of set but it was a very ghetto set compared to the kind of sets you see I'm like why we get.

295
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:58,453
Scott: we get there and it's an all fancy set.

296
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:00,481
Scott: what are you gonna be so wrong?

297
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,788
Rym: because I know I was there last weekend.

298
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:04,670
Scott: so this is a video a short video.

299
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:14,672
Rym: I'm sorry it's on Hulu but this is the best place to get a video like that where it won't get knocked off the internet by copyright.

300
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:21,342
Rym: this shows just what it's like for them to change the set on the commercial break on a live show.

301
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:22,670
Rym: it's pretty hectic.

302
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,130
Rym: and now as Scott pointed out when we watch it together we I understand why.

303
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,262
Rym: every time SNL starts up again the crowd is cheering

304
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:30,231
Scott: yeah cuz like the

305
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:33,686
Rym: guy's standing he's like come on 30 seconds just get the desk just get the desk and there's

306
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:34,309
Scott: like three two and then

307
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:38,968
Rym: they're good to go like

308
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:40,756
Scott: they got the desk and there's like ten seconds.

309
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:43,510
Scott: so the guy like tosses a chair under this day yep.

310
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,992
Rym: and then the guy the actors like fiddlers wig wig wig wig and then he starts the skit like right away.

311
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:49,520
Scott: yep damn the thing.

312
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:50,605
Scott: I don't understand though.

313
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,002
Scott: why don't they just have the rotating Les Miserables stage?

314
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:54,686
Scott: it would be so much.

315
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:58,766
Scott: that's really expensive but I mean they've been doing the show for how many years?

316
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,255
Scott: how much money do they make?

317
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:05,042
Scott: I mean come on they could have the rotating stage where that has like three sets and they can set up the set.

318
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:11,254
Rym: and I went to a thing where I got to like walk on one of those sets and like talk to the actors and everything when I was in high school.

319
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:15,113
Rym: it is hard as fuck to walk straight on that Les Mis set.

320
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:18,669
Scott: yeah but this that's because in Les Mis they're what that they don't?

321
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,884
Scott: you're walking on the thing while it rotates.

322
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:26,330
Scott: for this it would be just three positions that were static and you wouldn't be on it while it was rotating.

323
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,580
Rym: you know Les Mis they have those scenes.

324
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,624
Rym: they're like everyone's walking next to each other while the prisoners and the chain gang look down.

325
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:42,588
Scott: yeah so for the first time in a long time we are actually doing something we said we would do but did not do and that is have interviews and more guests on the show.

326
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:49,582
Scott: so today we have with us someone that you probably don't know but it's very important to at least listeners of this show.

327
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:50,928
Scott: you definitely know his work.

328
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:59,303
Scott: you know his work that we have with us Mark O'Sullivan the creator of the vanilla forum which is the forum that we use the show.

329
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:00,547
Guest: thank you.

330
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,096
Scott: so maybe we should start out.

331
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,123
Scott: you know just some basic questions about.

332
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:06,886
Scott: you know vanilla.

333
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:09,074
Scott: so to get people on the ball here.

334
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:12,689
Scott: so vanilla is obviously an internet discussion.

335
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,458
Scott: you know web forum software.

336
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:22,167
Scott: right but obviously obviously why did you you know what was the original impetus to to make it sure?

337
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,539
Guest: well so at the time that I that I started vanilla I was doing.

338
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,302
Guest: I had I had my own discussion forum that I was running for graphic designers and programmers.

339
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:36,816
Guest: it was called oh wait as in the number or the letter O and the number eight it came out of another form called dreamless org.

340
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:43,445
Guest: sorry it's like a whole history of forms thing that happened in many many years ago and so my form oh it was.

341
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:54,689
Guest: it was a sort of a catch-all discussion forum for people to get together and talk about whatever the hell they wanted and it typically was graphic designers and programmers and we found in all the software that was out there didn't really suit our purposes.

342
00:20:54,709 --> 00:21:24,656
Guest: we wanted to do a you know have special features for the forums and they were all kind of one-size-fits-all and so we started to custom program things here and there and eventually we got the idea to make a whole plug-in framework around it and and we were able to take something that was really complex and make it very vanilla and and then you know introduce cool functionality through plugins and theming and and run run that community for a really long time and then eventually all these designers and programmers really wanted to use the software.

343
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:29,485
Guest: so they asked if I could open source this this custom form that I'd written and that's when I released vanilla in 2005.

344
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:34,008
Rym: so it was definitely the functionality driven as opposed to aesthetics driven.

345
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:35,776
Guest: it was a little of both.

346
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:42,550
Guest: like I said there were designers in the forum and we took a sort of a very simple approach again another vanilla approach to the layout.

347
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:53,433
Guest: we removed all that bloody stuff that you see in many other discussion forums and and and kept it very simple and and because of that it made adding new design kind of easy.

348
00:21:54,096 --> 00:22:02,823
Guest: so I mean you can look at it a ton of vanilla one installations and they might look exactly like the default install but they might look like something you've never seen before.

349
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:09,696
Guest: so we you know we've seen it go from being a simple forum to being a project management tool to being a blog to being an issue tracker.

350
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:13,532
Guest: at one point it was the reviewing tool for add-ons for Firefox.

351
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:16,003
Scott: oh wow really I didn't know so.

352
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:16,948
Guest: so yeah it's.

353
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,585
Guest: I mean we like to say that you may not have heard of us but you probably use our software.

354
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:25,220
Scott: hmm so so now vanilla 2 is has come out.

355
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,877
Scott: so what is the you know big difference between vanilla 2 and vanilla 1?

356
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:36,302
Guest: so we realized that there was still a lot of ground to be broken in in the forum space.

357
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,709
Guest: and what community discussion space.

358
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:47,225
Guest: and looking around at all these amazing social networks that were popping up everywhere we thought you know everybody should be able to build one of these and and so with vanilla 2 we sort of went at it that way.

359
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:53,285
Guest: we also realized though that okay first of all there were a lot of improvements that could be made to the plugin framework and theming engine.

360
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:58,193
Guest: so we sort of basically rewrote the whole thing from the ground up and and you can do a lot more with that now.

361
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:06,885
Guest: but more importantly we realized that a lot of forum solutions try to be you know the full solution for your site.

362
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:19,952
Guest: so instead of adding a forum to your site they want you to the form to be your site and and we thought it was much more interesting to look at all the platforms that people are using out there like Drupal and WordPress and you know name your CMS.

363
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:24,233
Guest: and wouldn't it be really cool if it was just very very simple to add vanilla to that?

364
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:28,214
Guest: and so once your users sign into your existing site they're automatically signed into vanilla.

365
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:38,340
Guest: all the look and feel sort of transfers across and so that's sort of where we've gone with it and beyond that we're looking at making activity cultivation our number one goal.

366
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,795
Guest: so we want to make sure that if you're running your forum on our software your users will be more engaged and you will get more organic search traffic.

367
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:59,976
Rym: so did you put any thought when you were designing it into the sort of you know not to throw on game theory terms but the mechanism design like you know like BB and all these different kinds of software they show like post counts and things and they tend to engender a certain kind of behavior.

368
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:06,080
Rym: did you wonder about how your design would cause certain behaviors in the users or is that just completely off the table?

369
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:08,893
Guest: no that's absolutely one of the things we played with.

370
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,059
Guest: even with vanilla one.

371
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:22,409
Guest: we wanted to get rid of all the stuff that people were used to and and try to make them think that you know when they look at vanilla do they even know it's a forum because they have this archetypal idea of what it is and and what it means to see those things on the screen?

372
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:29,208
Guest: like we looked at most other forms we were like half that information you don't need and it doesn't add value in any way and so let's just get rid of it.

373
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:40,029
Guest: and and then and then beyond that you know let's let's look at each community on a on a one-off basis and and let's see what works for that particular community.

374
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:44,858
Guest: you know like post counts and signatures might make sense on one might totally not make sense on another.

375
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:47,911
Scott: I can tell you that's pretty much the.

376
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:51,955
Scott: the reason that I picked vanilla from the beginning was that it didn't have you know each.

377
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:55,489
Scott: the posts were not gigantic with avatars that you know the size of.

378
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:59,263
Scott: I need my 600 pixel animated avatar.

379
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:05,900
Scott: everyone didn't have a huge animated banner ad signature that showed up over and over again every time they posted a comment.

380
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:09,635
Guest: yeah absolutely and actually you know we we we do like.

381
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:12,490
Guest: no no with vanilla - we also have vanilla forums.

382
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,025
Guest: that we're sorry vanilla forms dot org is where we have the download product.

383
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:15,306
Guest: we also.

384
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:24,999
Guest: we also know vanilla forums calm which is it's sort of a wordpress model where you know you can go to calm and set up a forum online and then you can chart where we charge you for extra features.

385
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:43,087
Guest: and so we have a lot of forums on running on there and we're working very closely with a lot of the bigger ones at you know getting that activity cultivation happening and we found that for some of them those giant signatures and and all those little things that you used to do make sense but you know they can still be improved upon.

386
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:53,463
Guest: so for example one of the plugins that we've made recently is a signatures plug-in but it has a bunch of different settings so you looking at the forum can decide do you want to see any of signatures of your friends or no?

387
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,314
Guest: and if you do do you want to allow HTML in them or not?

388
00:25:57,618 --> 00:26:14,356
Guest: and so you you know simple signatures could be broken down to something that's as simple as the plain text to something that has a giant animated manga character - no signatures at all it's up to you.

389
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:23,082
Scott: so you know as far as like a user of the forum is concerned right because I mean most people out there using vanilla are just you know they're commenting they're not running their own right.

390
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:32,234
Scott: so it's right for the people who are who are using our forum what what in vanilla 2 is there to to excite them you know in terms of new features.

391
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:45,092
Guest: so again we've looked at a lot of what's going on in community and social network space and we've grabbed a lot of these features that we think are just awesome for example at mentioning somebody.

392
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:50,581
Guest: if you at mention somebody in a comment in vanilla that person will get notified not only in the activity stream but by email.

393
00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:51,565
Guest: if it's in their preferences.

394
00:26:52,469 --> 00:27:01,852
Guest: you can hashtag searches so you can hash a word and then that becomes a tag for for a discussion and those can be clicked on to run a search and see everything like we.

395
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:04,103
Guest: just we want to streamline the process of it.

396
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:10,107
Guest: what users are getting used to seeing on other sites is very much there in vanilla.

397
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:16,159
Guest: so and that that's not even touching on all the things that you can do with with all the plugins that we have available.

398
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:21,410
Guest: I mean vanilla 2 has only been out for four weeks and even at the time of launch there were already 40 plugins written for it.

399
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:34,500
Guest: so the community is really getting ramped up and and for me the most exciting thing is just seeing a the plugins that get made for the software because half the time people come up with stuff that we had no idea about and and it's really fascinating.

400
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,848
Guest: but the second was seeing how the users end up using it.

401
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:45,728
Guest: I'm excited to see what everybody thinks about it and and actually on our own forum vanilla forms dot org our open source community forum.

402
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:56,743
Guest: we're always throwing out plugins that people have made whether it's us or people in the community and testing them out and and seeing how people react to them and and and seeing how how that drives usage.

403
00:27:57,507 --> 00:28:04,365
Guest: and specifically related to that we even got a plug-in that we've been working on in-house that we've got on some forms on our hosted vanilla forums com site.

404
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:15,373
Guest: that is specifically about tracking those statistics and finding out you know who are the most active users and are they actually adding value or are they just putting a lot of content out there?

405
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:20,602
Guest: and and and you know what are the most popular discussions during particular time ranges?

406
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:21,829
Guest: and I don't know.

407
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:24,643
Guest: it's a lot of fun and really interesting to look at your community in that way.

408
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:27,631
Scott: no all right.

409
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:35,364
Scott: so I know you sent out a little press release today that mentioned something about like a vanilla forums partner reseller program.

410
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:35,826
Scott: can you tell me?

411
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:36,287
Scott: yes

412
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:59,640
Guest: yeah so like I said we've got the dot com hosting service right now and and you know we're one of the things that we've realized is that first of all growing starting a community is very very difficult and second of all if even if you have an existing community getting it over and moved across and gaining traction is still very difficult.

413
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:13,707
Guest: but when we removed the boundaries that our users had of you know getting the software downloading it getting it on a server understanding how all those things work you know if you're technical enough to make it through that then you can think about starting your forum.

414
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,384
Guest: and with dot com we wanted to get rid of that whole process.

415
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:18,640
Guest: so you just go and you fill out a you know a little form.

416
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:27,562
Guest: you can create a form really quickly and then what we realize is that what happens is a lot of people come they'll sign up to create a form to look around and they'll be.

417
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:32,206
Guest: you know they won't have invested any time so they'll be much more ready ready to abandon it.

418
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:58,803
Guest: and so we started talking to our existing users who are using the software and we found that a lot of them were you know graphic designers programmers contractors or even straight-up design firms and they you know they have customers that need this stuff and and and they were they want to resell it you know we they want to even be able to white label our software and and then go to their clients that yes we now offer this forum service.

419
00:29:59,386 --> 00:30:12,804
Guest: so this is the first step towards that and you know enabling those people that are already engaged and want to start building on this on the platform to you know have an incentive to do so but also you know make it an easy process for them.

420
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:25,785
Guest: so basically it's a simple referral program and and if you get if you say no somebody who's running a discussion forum and you bring them onto our platform you get 20% of the revenue that we get for the entire time that that customer is with us.

421
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:26,932
Scott: no that's pretty cool.

422
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:27,193
Scott: so you.

423
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:30,874
Scott: so if I give I get someone and they stick with vanilla for like forever.

424
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:33,047
Scott: you know cuz then we've been using it for how many years?

425
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:36,144
Rym: Oh God it's almost the beginning like four or five right?

426
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:38,537
Scott: so if they just keep paying I just keep getting money.

427
00:30:38,577 --> 00:30:41,110
Scott: you know that 20 absolutely absolutely yeah.

428
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:52,727
Guest: I mean we're also the mindset that you know if you're whether you're it's you guys just doing something for fun or if it's you're actually a design firm and and you need a forum solution you know why shouldn't you make money off of that?

429
00:30:52,747 --> 00:30:55,783
Guest: yeah and you you're using the software you're building with it.

430
00:30:55,823 --> 00:30:56,566
Guest: you should be making money.

431
00:30:58,353 --> 00:31:01,845
Scott: so so on some you know slightly less related things.

432
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:08,351
Scott: so vanilla I notice it's made with PHP right yep yep so the you know I'm a programmer.

433
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:10,059
Scott: I work with Python for a living.

434
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,305
Scott: I used to do PHP stuff.

435
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:17,356
Scott: I'm not one of those you know sort of zealot people who will say oh this is good and this is bad and you shouldn't lose you know.

436
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:21,874
Scott: but obviously there are many people who are PHP haters out there.

437
00:31:21,894 --> 00:31:28,103
Scott: you know yeah and it's it's pretty much you know the the whipping boy of web development at least if you read.

438
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:30,853
Scott: you know the various tech enthusiasts sites.

439
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:37,279
Scott: so you know given that what made you you know decide to stick with PHP or pick it in the first place?

440
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:45,266
Guest: so the dirty little secret of vanilla is that the first version of vanilla was written in dotnet.

441
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:50,844
Guest: oh so C sharp okay and that was the first version that I tried to open source.

442
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:53,076
Guest: and this was basically what was going on.

443
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:57,436
Guest: is the first version that was written not for release was all done with VB script.

444
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:05,872
Guest: and believe it or not the very first version of it which is probably written around 2001 had a Microsoft Access database.

445
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:10,727
Guest: so like this is going back a really really long time and for people who know what ASP is.

446
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:29,412
Guest: but I got hired by Microsoft to do dotnet support when they released dotnet to the world and so I had sort of a little edge on what was going on with dotnet before it even was released and I was using it to do some test development for the support tasks that I was going to be doing at Microsoft and I decided that I was.

447
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:30,576
Guest: I loved it.

448
00:32:30,997 --> 00:32:31,740
Guest: I loved C sharp.

449
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,229
Guest: it was you know very similar to Java.

450
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:38,776
Guest: it was a lot of fun to write with and let's face it if you ever use Visual Studio it's the best ID in the planet.

451
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,764
Guest: I don't care what anybody says.

452
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:43,596
Guest: yeah they're their IntelliSense.

453
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:46,772
Rym: as an IT guy I don't write a lot of software but I'd write a soap service.

454
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:53,266
Rym: recently and after banging my head against all the broken Python modules dotnet I basically said right click make soap service done.

455
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,294
Scott: yeah yeah Visual Studios.

456
00:32:55,314 --> 00:33:02,107
Scott: you know I'm a vim UNIX kind of guy but you know I've used Visual Studio to do XNA stuff and I definitely you know I'm not down on it.

457
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,236
Guest: yeah it's it's amazing.

458
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:21,093
Guest: so so I just really wanted an excuse to keep on working with Visual Studio and so I did the first version in C sharp and of course when it came time to release it nobody wanted it because at the time not only was there not a lot of dotnet servers out there nobody knew how to use it nobody knew what it was.

459
00:33:21,113 --> 00:33:25,682
Guest: and I you know I I don't even know if I tried to release now what to get the pickup that it needs.

460
00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:29,743
Guest: because let's face it you know you think open source you don't think dotnet.

461
00:33:29,763 --> 00:33:40,256
Scott: I mean even if the even if you give out something like that open source let's say WordPress you know was written for dotnet and was open source you know to be able to run it you guess you could use mono and it's it's.

462
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:42,267
Scott: that's a huge pain right you would have to.

463
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:47,191
Scott: you have to use what like Microsoft SQL Server and IIS but those aren't really free you know.

464
00:33:47,232 --> 00:33:50,427
Scott: so yeah even though this one part is free the rest of it isn't free.

465
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:59,766
Scott: but if you do any of the other you know an open source language Python Ruby you know Perl PHP whatever you know the whole lamp stack is.

466
00:33:59,826 --> 00:34:00,689
Scott: the whole thing is free.

467
00:34:01,593 --> 00:34:11,228
Guest: yeah absolutely and I mean so when it when I realized that that wasn't gonna fly and I had to sort of abandon it it wasn't the saddest part of my life.

468
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:13,395
Guest: I I've never really.

469
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:16,128
Guest: I didn't set out to make vanilla and open source project.

470
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:17,777
Guest: that made me money back.

471
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:27,108
Guest: when I did it in 2005 I was just doing it because I was I'm a big freaking geek and I like to program and I wanted to program in any language and use any database and try any technology I could get my hands on.

472
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:34,145
Guest: and so you know when I found out that that wasn't gonna work and people didn't like it they wanted the functionality they didn't want the language.

473
00:34:34,726 --> 00:34:44,327
Guest: so I I just looked around at what was available and I realized that lamp works like PHP and MySQL can run on anything and so that was the deciding factor.

474
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:46,982
Guest: so vanilla one was the first thing I ever wrote in PHP.

475
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:58,214
Guest: oh well actually if you look at if you look at the code that it kind of makes sense that you know there's a lot of classes which at the time with PHP for didn't didn't really make sense because it didn't scale.

476
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:04,007
Guest: and that was one of the problems with vanilla one is that as soon as it hit a large capacity of users it really didn't scale.

477
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:05,193
Scott: well yeah I had that.

478
00:35:05,274 --> 00:35:06,339
Scott: I had that problem also.

479
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,250
Scott: it was like our forum got slow and slow.

480
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:16,150
Scott: but then eventually what I did is I just went into MySQL and I like indexed a whole bunch of you know the the columns and then you know as soon as I did that it was.

481
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,737
Scott: it was alright yeah.

482
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:26,231
Guest: and even then like we've had some very very big forums use use vanilla one and and you know we did a lot of hacks to make it work well.

483
00:35:26,854 --> 00:35:32,286
Guest: and when we decided we were gonna do vanilla two and we were gonna rewrite it all from the ground up and we were gonna go PHP 5 we knew that.

484
00:35:32,607 --> 00:35:37,188
Guest: you know this time it'll be fast and just by the fact that it's PHP 5 only it's faster.

485
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:41,650
Guest: but we've also done tons of optimizations from the lessons that we learned with vanilla one.

486
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:42,575
Scott: so what are?

487
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:42,816
Scott: so?

488
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:45,649
Scott: what are some of the like the biggest vanilla forums out there?

489
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:52,275
Guest: well the biggest one obviously that we've ever seen out there in the wilds was the the Firefox add-on site.

490
00:35:52,296 --> 00:36:04,067
Guest: I mean that's millions and millions and millions of people using that forum and the sad part about it is that they customized it so much that you couldn't even tell it was vanilla.

491
00:36:04,308 --> 00:36:07,981
Guest: so we really didn't get any credit at all which is fine.

492
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:22,250
Guest: you know that's open source too but we've also been talking to some bigger companies with millions of users that want to want to use it now and and we're working on modules for vanilla two that you know some memcache modules and other kinds of caching mechanism pretty useful.

493
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:34,186
Guest: I could use that yeah and and for our own purposes with our hosting services you know we've had to do a bunch of changes to the code you know to allow things like multi server database selects and all this kind of stuff.

494
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:37,419
Guest: so so scaling is a big thing for us for sure.

495
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:43,266
Guest: I'd love to mention one of the ones we're working with right now but it's not locked in deal so I can't do it right.

496
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:50,276
Scott: so when you when you move to PHP and gave up Visual Studio what are you like using Eclipse?

497
00:36:50,316 --> 00:36:50,739
Scott: or what do you?

498
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:52,305
Scott: what did you move to?

499
00:36:53,148 --> 00:36:59,549
Guest: yeah that was a long long arduous road of what the hell ID should I use in the beginning?

500
00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:01,455
Guest: yeah I did a lot of notepad.

501
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,552
Guest: I'm not not really a vim guy one actually my favorite.

502
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:12,844
Guest: if you're going con like straight up command-line stuff whenever I SSH to a server the first thing I load up is midnight commander.

503
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:19,415
Guest: oh yes if you guys know what midnight commander is a sort of Unix and that has a really nice editor in it.

504
00:37:19,515 --> 00:37:21,445
Guest: if I'm doing live edits on the server that's what I'm using.

505
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:28,456
Guest: but if I'm doing straight-up development typically I'm running Komodo and but it's weird.

506
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:35,873
Scott: like in my office everybody runs something different nobody runs the same ID it's the same in my office like one guy uses Xcode one guy uses textmate I got vim.

507
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,829
Scott: it's it's a. no one wants to do the same thing as anyone else.

508
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:47,095
Guest: yeah we got one guy using net beans another guy using what's the company that does transmit Toda?

509
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:51,815
Guest: oh yeah which blows me away because there's no auto completion or anything.

510
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:52,137
Guest: I don't know.

511
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:58,587
Guest: well I think there is for classes but there's not for PHP in classes anyway I couldn't do it myself all right.

512
00:37:58,627 --> 00:38:00,939
Scott: so let's let's get away from from vanilla here.

513
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:01,644
Rym: the more fun stuff.

514
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:04,141
Rym: yeah yeah because you said pretty much straight up you're a big geek.

515
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:14,841
Guest: so yes just about vanilla it's well no things I think it would be unfair for me to lie.

516
00:38:15,322 --> 00:38:22,521
Guest: but um like so video games for example the geek that's a loaded statement.

517
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:24,907
Rym: video games like what's the game you're playing right now?

518
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:33,831
Guest: this is for online play is like heroin to me.

519
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:34,593
Guest: I can't get enough.

520
00:38:34,654 --> 00:38:38,848
Guest: I can't stop playing as soon and I never ever put the headphones in.

521
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:43,527
Guest: all I do is go online and and make friends with somebody and then I'll drop a grenade into their car.

522
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:59,240
Guest: I love I love the fact that you can go on there and every once in a while I'll actually put the headphones in I'll hear what they're saying and it's just a bunch of kids screaming or else they're gonna threaten that they're gonna come get me and that's my favorite thing is just to antagonize everybody in the game.

523
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,678
Guest: preferably you know as many players as possible until they're all after me.

524
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:03,402
Scott: oh well it's.

525
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:13,386
Scott: it's so fitting that someone who's like a big video game griefer would make an internet discussion for him which is the tool of trolls everywhere.

526
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:14,971
Guest: that's another thing actually.

527
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,737
Guest: so trolls.

528
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:21,344
Guest: I don't actually don't know if I want to give this away but we've got a bunch of troll plugins for vanilla - that we were working on.

529
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:22,472
Rym: we've wanted that forever.

530
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:29,853
Rym: I wanted little funny things to do like if someone gets flagged as a troll they think they're posting they see their own posts but no one sees their posts.

531
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:31,099
Guest: yeah we've got that.

532
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:33,022
Scott: I've.

533
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:50,303
Scott: actually we've thought of some other things like once a long time ago years ago on slash that there was like a tech demo of like a stupidity detector and it was basically you would type any text into it and if it thought that your post was like a stupid post like if you just said you know first it would detect it as stupid.

534
00:39:50,323 --> 00:40:01,419
Scott: but if you actually wrote a cohesion you know coherent coherent sentence it would say okay this post is not stupid and I'm like oh I wish the forum would just automatically you know tell someone your post is stupid.

535
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:04,675
Scott: we're not allowing it rewrite it stupid like tech typing detected.

536
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:06,204
Guest: actually that's a really good.

537
00:40:06,224 --> 00:40:06,526
Guest: we haven't.

538
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:11,454
Guest: we hadn't done that one because that's not so much trolling as it is just you know idiocy right.

539
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:15,218
Rym: that's something we do like the biggest thing in our forum that we use and we just kind of hack it.

540
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:16,383
Rym: we have moderators who can do it.

541
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:21,744
Rym: is we correct in line grammar and spelling really in anyone's post?

542
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:22,789
Guest: yeah it's funny.

543
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:33,497
Guest: like I was talking to a guy recently who runs a really really really big forum millions of users millions of people every day on it and they moderate every single comment in their forum.

544
00:40:33,818 --> 00:40:35,889
Scott: well they must have like an army of moderate.

545
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:44,510
Guest: yeah there's a big and all the moderators do it for free of course but yeah like I can't imagine going to trust all those moderators too because any one of them could be.

546
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:49,733
Guest: you know yeah and when when he told us this I you know it blew me away.

547
00:40:50,055 --> 00:41:02,141
Guest: but at the same time I was like there's such a huge opportunity right there like we just writing even the most rudimentary parser to figure out if something is bad or good or even just looking for you know words that flag something is bad and you know have a black and white list.

548
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,326
Guest: they don't even have that.

549
00:41:03,346 --> 00:41:05,976
Guest: I mean imagine how much it could be reduced.

550
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:07,683
Scott: so I mean that would.

551
00:41:07,724 --> 00:41:08,065
Scott: also.

552
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:14,717
Scott: there's a lot of sites out there that you know have a requirement that they need to moderate everything like newspapers.

553
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:21,895
Scott: for example whenever you try to comment on an actual newspaper especially a local one it's like they always moderate every single post that goes in.

554
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:23,585
Guest: you know actually actually it's funny.

555
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:32,525
Guest: you mentioned that a friend of mine recently tweeted that apparently the very first newspapers in the States had pages for comments at the end like blank pages.

556
00:41:32,545 --> 00:41:36,158
Guest: oh wow I don't understand how that possibly worked.

557
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:42,151
Scott: I guess you would write a comment and then you would leave the newspaper on the trolley and yeah and also pick it up.

558
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:44,923
Rym: so back in the day that people just draw cockboats they're like.

559
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:45,545
Rym: what did they do?

560
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:49,419
Scott: they drew a big animated flip book.

561
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,445
Scott: that was their signature and you would flip through.

562
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:56,359
Rym: so how about games like?

563
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:57,427
Rym: well how did you get indie game like?

564
00:41:57,447 --> 00:42:00,306
Rym: what was the first game you played that you recognized as a game like?

565
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:04,283
Rym: your sentient mind was like I'm playing a game oh god like.

566
00:42:04,344 --> 00:42:10,208
Guest: as in video game because I mean obviously tag I mean you're a kid you're playing tag.

567
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:15,845
Guest: but the first video game I ever wrote or sorry played it was one that I wrote in basic.

568
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:21,926
Guest: my dad had one of those like original computers that had like a tiny little screen.

569
00:42:21,946 --> 00:42:25,545
Guest: you flip up and the keyboards underneath it and you remember which model it was.

570
00:42:25,565 --> 00:42:27,152
Guest: I don't remember.

571
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,457
Guest: and he threw it away.

572
00:42:28,498 --> 00:42:31,483
Guest: I think so but it had.

573
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:35,414
Guest: so it didn't have a hard drive it just had a floppy and it was.

574
00:42:38,484 --> 00:42:49,935
Guest: and and so I turn it on it would boot up and I'd have to program my game and I'd spend you know 45 minutes programming this stupid game and then I'd play it and I'd be so exhausted and tired of it.

575
00:42:49,995 --> 00:42:57,436
Guest: by then I'd play for like two minutes and then I turned the computer up knowing that everything's getting all 45 minutes of code is just gone.

576
00:42:57,456 --> 00:42:58,238
Scott: that's every good.

577
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:05,744
Scott: every good programmer started working on some old machine that only did basic yeah 85 used in school.

578
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
Guest: basically this was just.

579
00:43:07,612 --> 00:43:12,256
Guest: it was that stupid game where you know the block in the center is your car and then the roads coming down.

580
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:15,216
Guest: you know like there's two bars along the side they're going side to side.

581
00:43:15,236 --> 00:43:16,663
Guest: you go to steer your car down the road.

582
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:18,169
Scott: no it's a good game.

583
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:21,181
Scott: yeah did you have turns and obstacles there?

584
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:24,710
Guest: I I was not that that's dedicated.

585
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:27,237
Guest: there were turns.

586
00:43:27,277 --> 00:43:28,039
Guest: it was zigzagging.

587
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,254
Guest: right but that's all Zach's on.

588
00:43:32,274 --> 00:43:34,923
Guest: I think was the first one I got really excited by three-dimensional.

589
00:43:35,023 --> 00:43:42,805
Rym: Wow so any non video like it you ever play like D&D or like German board games anything like that?

590
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,436
Guest: no maybe when I was younger.

591
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:50,051
Guest: actually I did get into Magic the Gathering when I was in college.

592
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:50,574
Scott: what?

593
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:51,458
Scott: so what sets were out?

594
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,009
Scott: when at that time do you remember?

595
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,672
Guest: um it was.

596
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:56,741
Guest: it was like they didn't have a lot of sets.

597
00:43:56,761 --> 00:43:58,588
Guest: this is like right in the very beginning.

598
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,495
Guest: and so what was my best?

599
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,604
Guest: I had a bunch of Sarah like.

600
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:07,524
Guest: I had an like an angel that had a bunch of Sarah angels and oh yeah I was.

601
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:14,323
Guest: I had a like a white deck and a blue deck that was sort of munch together and I had one of those oysters that catch people and hold them at the bottom of the ocean.

602
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:15,067
Guest: it's been a long time.

603
00:44:16,914 --> 00:44:18,866
Scott: it's always interesting you know because we still.

604
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:22,756
Scott: we go to conventions and we still see kids playing magic today and we look at the cards they're playing with.

605
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:26,661
Scott: we don't recognize any of them but occasionally there's one card they got on the table that I I'm like.

606
00:44:26,701 --> 00:44:38,427
Scott: oh I know that card and every single person around you will if will either still be playing or will have played and they can tell you like I stopped playing at Fallen Empires I stopped playing at the you know the Arabian Nights and I you know

607
00:44:39,131 --> 00:44:50,021
Guest: for me it was one of those things like I think as soon as they started coming out with decks with other cards period and they were like they stopped making the old ones they started making these new ones and they didn't make any sense to me and they weren't very as powerful as the old ones.

608
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,867
Guest: and I was like this is BS.

609
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:54,836
Guest: yeah I don't know.

610
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:58,600
Guest: and in the end what it came down to is that I was in college and I needed beer money and so I sold all my.

611
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:01,852
Rym: I wish I'd sold mine back when they were worth money.

612
00:45:01,872 --> 00:45:08,000
Scott: yeah right well they're still kind of worth money just not you know it's not the $400 black Lotus days?

613
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,845
Scott: yeah yeah.

614
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:10,554
Guest: so if you and if you want to talk geek.

615
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:13,887
Guest: so another thing that I sold for money was comics.

616
00:45:14,229 --> 00:45:16,697
Guest: I'm a huge comic nerd so what.

617
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,281
Scott: so what do you still read comics like now?

618
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,687
Guest: no but I still have most of my good ones like.

619
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:22,789
Guest: I have a ton of.

620
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:35,740
Guest: I guess it would be around issue 240 250 something like that I was reading.

621
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,369
Scott: I had like the 300.

622
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:39,212
Guest: oh yeah I know I've been.

623
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:42,102
Guest: I had them like very old and I also have.

624
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:45,253
Guest: I have like the entire McFarland collection of amazing spider-man.

625
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:51,780
Guest: so from whenever he started I that was the early 90s I think yeah I have all those I had.

626
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:58,565
Guest: I had us like all my the all of spawn and I ended up selling spawn number one to this comic shop for beer.

627
00:45:58,686 --> 00:46:03,545
Guest: and then I this sounds bad that I sold everything for beer but it was college.

628
00:46:03,585 --> 00:46:09,290
Scott: come on I guess it depends what kind of college in Canada right that's right?

629
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:09,672
Scott: are we getting?

630
00:46:09,712 --> 00:46:10,517
Scott: was it labott blue?

631
00:46:10,537 --> 00:46:12,446
Scott: you were drinking those pilsner.

632
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:15,379
Guest: is the prairies okay like Molson pilsner I don't know.

633
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,762
Scott: and Rochester all the Canadian hockey player because we had a huge hockey team in Rochester.

634
00:46:19,823 --> 00:46:22,755
Scott: so all the it was full of Canadian players from.

635
00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:23,780
Scott: you know the from.

636
00:46:24,202 --> 00:46:27,058
Rym: they were all like hotel management majors yeah and they would all.

637
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:28,386
Scott: all they drank was the Bob blue.

638
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:32,086
Scott: you would see bottles of it like in big pyramids everywhere you know.

639
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:34,474
Guest: and in the prairies it's it's a lot of Molson.

640
00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:36,521
Guest: what else they got?

641
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:39,939
Guest: about 50 a lot of the bats and Molson I guess I don't know they're all.

642
00:46:41,322 --> 00:46:43,194
Guest: it's weird like from one part of Canada's the other.

643
00:46:43,516 --> 00:46:44,542
Guest: the beer is totally different.

644
00:46:44,783 --> 00:46:47,232
Guest: I mean coming to Quebec it's like a whole different country.

645
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:54,933
Scott: no yeah so you don't read comics anymore there.

646
00:46:54,993 --> 00:46:55,315
Scott: and so then?

647
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:59,721
Guest: no but I still have them there and they're all individually wrapped and cardboard backed and everything.

648
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:00,845
Guest: I was a huge comic.

649
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:03,013
Rym: so why'd you stop reading beer?

650
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:04,639
Guest: money money?

651
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:05,868
Guest: yeah it was purely money and it wasn't.

652
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:07,922
Guest: it was college and I couldn't afford to buy them anymore.

653
00:47:08,103 --> 00:47:10,292
Rym: but now after vanilla I mean you're clearly a millionaire.

654
00:47:10,352 --> 00:47:28,143
Scott: so if I if I if I could make a comic suggestion right there is a Jeff Lemire wrote a series of comics called the the Essex County trilogy which will probably appeal to you because it's about it's it's set in Canada Canadian that's all you know.

655
00:47:28,203 --> 00:47:37,305
Scott: it's also really awesome no but I you know if you if you you know you'll have a you know a shared you know childhood experience with him possibly because he was all you know.

656
00:47:37,345 --> 00:47:39,519
Scott: he's like also a comic reader same kind of person.

657
00:47:40,082 --> 00:47:42,130
Guest: right cool check it out.

658
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:46,749
Rym: I guess that or I mean ever in a Batman Dark Knight Returns is pretty much like.

659
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:49,078
Rym: that's a different road of comics.

660
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:50,564
Scott: I know knows about that.

661
00:47:50,645 --> 00:47:52,010
Guest: yeah heard of that one.

662
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,817
Scott: yeah it's like.

663
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:54,881
Scott: hey have you heard of movies?

664
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:55,623
Scott: you know you should see this.

665
00:47:55,663 --> 00:48:02,783
Scott: so I mean you know you're you're up in you're up in Montreal.

666
00:48:02,823 --> 00:48:07,668
Scott: it's not really like the big tech scene right I mean usually it's it's San Francisco and stuff.

667
00:48:07,688 --> 00:48:11,751
Scott: I mean we're in New York and we even get like flak for not being very technological.

668
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:15,006
Scott: so do you does that like cause any problems for you or anything like that?

669
00:48:15,468 --> 00:48:20,930
Guest: well I mean the way I look at it is first of all Montreal actually has a really good startup scene right now.

670
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:30,342
Guest: so it's sort of on the turnaround here and there's actually a lot of money coming into the province right now specifically into Montreal for for people who want to do startups in tech.

671
00:48:31,787 --> 00:49:01,322
Guest: I recently went to Vancouver just a week or so ago to this conference called grow and it was basically an opportunity for US investors and Canadian entrepreneurs to get together and talk about funding their companies and for me the most the best part about it was and no offense to the investors but meeting all the other companies from Canada because you know Canada is so big and it's so spread out that half the time we don't even know about each other even though we're all up here and it's actually across the entire country.

672
00:49:01,343 --> 00:49:09,962
Guest: you know a relatively small group of techies and and there's actually some really really cool stuff going on and some of it is as close as like.

673
00:49:09,982 --> 00:49:14,451
Guest: I met a ton of people from Ottawa and apparently there's a great startup scene in Ottawa and really cool stuff going on there.

674
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:18,798
Guest: for example I don't know if you heard of Shopify but that's that's a big one I thought about.

675
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:19,784
Scott: I've thought about using it.

676
00:49:20,368 --> 00:49:23,063
Guest: yeah they're great and I met one of the founders of Shopify.

677
00:49:23,103 --> 00:49:31,848
Guest: he has another one that he's doing now called SWIX which is the social web index which helps you to do all kinds of tracking of your campaigns across the social web like crazy stuff.

678
00:49:33,474 --> 00:49:36,728
Guest: yeah Montreal is actually really good and and the like.

679
00:49:36,789 --> 00:49:39,201
Guest: I say that the tech scene here is really starting to blow up.

680
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:40,991
Guest: there's events all the freaking time.

681
00:49:41,032 --> 00:49:42,340
Guest: I can't even keep up with them anymore.

682
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:45,208
Guest: yeah yeah it's a lot of fun.

683
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:48,084
Guest: and hey if you do come up let me know and you can come to the vanilla office.

684
00:49:48,104 --> 00:49:49,571
Guest: we'll hang out awesome.

685
00:49:49,632 --> 00:49:52,285
Scott: yeah I guess we've got some place to go on vacation there.

686
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:56,343
Rym: so we do have to ask because you do live north of the Messier line.

687
00:49:56,363 --> 00:49:57,146
Rym: you're a hockey fan.

688
00:49:58,251 --> 00:49:58,974
Guest: yeah you know that's.

689
00:49:59,616 --> 00:50:02,933
Guest: I'm almost embarrassed to be Canadian because I totally am NOT.

690
00:50:02,974 --> 00:50:05,323
Guest: I'm not a sportsman at all.

691
00:50:05,725 --> 00:50:09,616
Guest: don't watch any sports of any kind only into total geekery.

692
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,774
Guest: my co-founder is a huge sports fan but it just didn't.

693
00:50:14,115 --> 00:50:15,983
Guest: I don't even understand what the hell he's talking about.

694
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:20,760
Guest: I'm like failing and being Canadian by saying that that's all right.

695
00:50:21,501 --> 00:50:23,349
Scott: I you know I mean not everyone in the u.s.

696
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:26,922
Scott: is you know whatever stereotype of us you want to name?

697
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:36,603
Rym: so you said you were a geek and you said specifically geeks.

698
00:50:36,644 --> 00:50:39,587
Rym: I'm just curious because it seems like different parts of the world they use the words differently.

699
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:44,712
Rym: do you think there's any difference between a geek and a nerd or do you just use them interchangeably?

700
00:50:44,732 --> 00:50:47,160
Guest: yeah I don't know a nerd.

701
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:55,283
Guest: I can't help but think of revenge of the nerds and and that's their they're just not cool.

702
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:59,261
Guest: you know a geek a geek can be really smart and really cool half the time.

703
00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:06,364
Guest: even if a geek is a pretentious jerk you still want to know them because they're really smart and they think about stuff a lot and they can say amazing things that blow your mind.

704
00:51:06,886 --> 00:51:10,698
Guest: or as a nerd is just an idiot like.

705
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:13,031
Guest: I knew lots of nerds in college who who?

706
00:51:13,172 --> 00:51:14,922
Guest: you know they were into comics and stuff like that too.

707
00:51:14,962 --> 00:51:17,536
Guest: but then they come out of an exam like hey how'd you know?

708
00:51:17,757 --> 00:51:21,435
Guest: exam like oh you know high 80s high 90s and then they failed you know.

709
00:51:21,917 --> 00:51:23,442
Guest: oh really well that to me is a nerd.

710
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:31,304
Scott: that's us is a is a is a I think a dork dork maybe the same thing as a nerd.

711
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:35,281
Scott: I guess a nerd for us is someone who is you know at least for us it's.

712
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:37,069
Scott: it's like the guy.

713
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:38,796
Scott: the guy Steve Urkel is a nerd.

714
00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:40,062
Scott: right he has no social skills.

715
00:51:40,323 --> 00:51:41,288
Scott: you don't really want to be near him.

716
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:41,952
Scott: he's annoying.

717
00:51:42,374 --> 00:51:45,870
Scott: but yeah could make a rocket and it would work because he actually knows.

718
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:50,410
Rym: you know right a geek can make 90% of the rocket and he's totally cool.

719
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:51,012
Rym: yeah.

720
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:53,041
Guest: so like screech would be a nerd.

721
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:56,335
Rym: then yeah probably go more broad we always.

722
00:51:56,596 --> 00:52:10,164
Rym: the definition we use on the show at least because it's GeekNights is then our whole like focus is that a nerd has depth of focus in one area or maybe a couple areas and like they're like if there's a spider graph of their life there's like these gigantic spikes going way way out.

723
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:16,729
Rym: yeah but a geek is like they have depth of interest in many fields like they have this depth and breadth kind of combined.

724
00:52:16,749 --> 00:52:19,721
Guest: yeah yeah you know it's weird.

725
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:30,908
Guest: like since since I took the the plunge and tried to turn vanilla into a business started about I guess two years ago I decided that I wanted to stop working for other people and just do open source stuff.

726
00:52:32,755 --> 00:52:42,301
Guest: and at that time I realized as time got went by that I had to cut out a lot of other things that I was passionate about in life to make room for all that stuff that I had to learn.

727
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:47,084
Guest: I mean going from being a straight-up developer to being somebody that you know.

728
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:47,788
Guest: I'm a CEO.

729
00:52:47,828 --> 00:52:48,753
Guest: now I have board meetings.

730
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:50,702
Guest: I got a. I don't know about financials.

731
00:52:50,762 --> 00:52:53,432
Guest: I got to know about marketing.

732
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:54,857
Guest: you know business development.

733
00:52:55,279 --> 00:52:57,529
Guest: these are all things that that you know.

734
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:05,403
Guest: they're very very nerdy and geeky but in a totally different way and I had to sort of push room out out of my brain to move into other things.

735
00:53:05,444 --> 00:53:12,547
Guest: like at the time that I decided to do this move I just started to learn how to play guitar and it was another one of those things I was picking up I was getting better at and I had to drop it in.

736
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:17,662
Guest: life is a guitar dude.

737
00:53:17,943 --> 00:53:19,711
Guest: if you're a true geek you'll learn.

738
00:53:20,353 --> 00:53:25,134
Scott: yeah I mean it's weird like I played it when I was in trouble with the harmonica which was kind of a test I played.

739
00:53:25,194 --> 00:53:30,282
Scott: I played the guitar in fifth grade and then I stopped because I went to middle school.

740
00:53:30,302 --> 00:53:34,711
Scott: in middle school I joined the band and played the clarinet and I couldn't play to it once right so.

741
00:53:34,952 --> 00:53:38,711
Scott: and then after middle school I stopped playing the clarinet also so then it was nothing.

742
00:53:39,395 --> 00:53:40,561
Scott: and then later on I was like.

743
00:53:40,581 --> 00:53:41,790
Scott: you know I made a big mistake.

744
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:47,086
Scott: I should have stuck with the guitar the whole time because if I had stuck with it all the way through college I would have been like a rock star already.

745
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:48,593
Scott: right right that many years.

746
00:53:49,115 --> 00:53:55,432
Scott: but then I was like okay as soon as I had money I was like alright I should buy a guitar but wait what if I don't actually practice?

747
00:53:55,452 --> 00:53:59,756
Scott: I'll just waste money and I'll see the guitar sitting there you know making me feel guilty every day.

748
00:53:59,776 --> 00:54:01,224
Rym: eventually you'll see it on eBay.

749
00:54:01,264 --> 00:54:01,545
Rym: yeah.

750
00:54:01,927 --> 00:54:08,730
Scott: so I was like I know I'll buy a cheap instrument and if I have the discipline to practice it that means that I will also have the discipline to practice the guitar.

751
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,530
Rym: of course part of the trouble was you said harmonic and I'm like yeah I'll do it too.

752
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:12,919
Rym: but I played music all my life.

753
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,549
Rym: I almost became a professional trumpet players.

754
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:15,977
Rym: I was like I was rocking it.

755
00:54:16,279 --> 00:54:19,279
Scott: yes I bought harmonica and then I did not have the discipline to practice it.

756
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,018
Scott: so I said well I guess a guitar will just sit there making me feel guilty.

757
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,190
Scott: so I will not buy one that harmonica make you feel guilty?

758
00:54:24,793 --> 00:54:25,940
Scott: no because it was only five bucks.

759
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:28,370
Guest: well no offense to harmonica players.

760
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:34,938
Guest: but how can you feel cool playing a harmonica feel cool playing a guitar you know.

761
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:39,663
Guest: if you don't know what you're doing like walking by and they see you strumming on the guitar they're like that guy is cool.

762
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:45,891
Scott: no not in New York City where half the people with guitars just sort of you know got a bucket.

763
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:48,723
Scott: they were looking for spare change and they don't know how to play anything.

764
00:54:50,127 --> 00:54:54,764
Guest: and yeah anyway anyway I digress it's it's a same for.

765
00:54:54,864 --> 00:54:57,523
Guest: so for that reason I mean I don't have enough time to dedicate to video games.

766
00:54:57,564 --> 00:55:01,792
Guest: I bought all these games because I get excited about them and like Left 4 Dead I really wanted to play it.

767
00:55:01,873 --> 00:55:02,617
Guest: I played it a little bit.

768
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:07,157
Guest: I had already left for dead - yeah I know I'm but I'm the I didn't.

769
00:55:07,177 --> 00:55:14,830
Guest: even I haven't had time for Left 4 Dead 2 I've only done Left 4 Dead 1 and again I honestly I actually had to stop playing that one because it gave me nightmares.

770
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:23,586
Guest: for some reason zombies terrify me I don't know why and actually I just read World War Z by Max Brooks.

771
00:55:23,766 --> 00:55:24,549
Scott: I've heard about that.

772
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:30,125
Guest: if you should read that book it is amazing and it's again.

773
00:55:30,165 --> 00:55:31,551
Guest: there's another reason that I'm geeky.

774
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:34,924
Guest: I read a ton of geeky books like that.

775
00:55:35,205 --> 00:55:41,799
Rym: you got any any book recommendations besides book club we get people to read like Ray Bradbury Princeton nothing all these crazy books.

776
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:51,072
Guest: well actually this is gonna sound weird but my wife made me read the time travelers wife and I know like.

777
00:55:51,093 --> 00:55:53,728
Guest: I was like really you're gonna make me read this just sounds so lame.

778
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:54,613
Guest: and then they made the movie.

779
00:55:54,774 --> 00:55:56,826
Guest: this is she made me read it before the movie but I was like.

780
00:55:57,108 --> 00:56:06,527
Guest: that's actually like a kick-ass book that you know written by a woman and and it's it comes across like some kind of sci-fi thing by a guy.

781
00:56:06,547 --> 00:56:07,130
Guest: I don't know it.

782
00:56:07,452 --> 00:56:08,979
Guest: it was really cool and not what you expect.

783
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,992
Guest: it was kind of hardcore huh.

784
00:56:13,353 --> 00:56:16,083
Guest: and the movie just like softened it up and it was total cheese ball.

785
00:56:16,103 --> 00:56:16,846
Guest: so don't watch the movie.

786
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:27,168
Guest: duly noted as can often happen my books right in front of me.

787
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:31,545
Guest: so well Irvin Welsh I'll just I'll just throw that out there read anything by Irvin Welsh.

788
00:56:32,748 --> 00:56:41,495
Guest: Wikipedia is the guy that wrote Trainspot Trainspot oh yeah and and so like his books.

789
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:45,420
Guest: if you can if you can make it through one of his books then you can make it through all of his books.

790
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:52,165
Guest: and here he has a very strange way of writing and half the time he uses that Scottish slang so you it takes a while to understand what the hell they're talking about.

791
00:56:52,205 --> 00:56:56,290
Scott: that could be really fun though because when you watch the movie with the slang you don't really get all of it.

792
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:02,444
Scott: but if I could read it I feel like I could go slowly and learn it and actually maybe you reuse it and learn pikey maybe.

793
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:14,614
Guest: and if you if you like Trainspotting he's made a sequel to it called porno which is way way better than Trainspotting was and apparently Ewan McGregor has been saying that he's never gonna do this.

794
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:18,411
Guest: he hates porno he thinks it was a horrible sequel and blah blah blah blah.

795
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:22,793
Guest: but and they say they're not gonna make the sequel unless he agrees to do it.

796
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:34,536
Guest: so it's kind of dead in the water but it's it's amazing it's so funny and if you like Francis Begbie you know Begbie if I don't know can we swear on this show?

797
00:57:34,677 --> 00:57:36,585
Scott: yes you can say whatever you want okay.

798
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:46,456
Guest: so in in Trainspotting he's the one he's playing pool and he throws this his mug or his pint of beer over the balcony goes and smashes some girl in the head and then there's like mayhem.

799
00:57:46,476 --> 00:57:56,425
Guest: downstairs is everybody trying to figure out what's going on and he comes down the stairs and goes some cunt glass lassie and no cunt leaves till we find out what cunt done it in porno he goes absolutely wild.

800
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:57,426
Guest: is is an amazing book.

801
00:57:57,446 --> 00:58:06,606
Scott: I had to have to put that on a list here.

802
00:58:07,189 --> 00:58:08,275
Rym: so how about notice how we started?

803
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:09,763
Rym: very specific we draw out now.

804
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:11,188
Rym: so movies.

805
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:14,844
Rym: now the the lame question anyone ever asked like what your favorite movie?

806
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:16,836
Rym: because it's just a crap question to try to answer.

807
00:58:16,876 --> 00:58:19,329
Rym: so I don't know what are like three movies that you like.

808
00:58:20,394 --> 00:58:21,399
Guest: well you know what.

809
00:58:21,459 --> 00:58:30,956
Guest: when we were just talking about sequels there it reminded me of I I'm a huge Mad Max nerd and and now they're making Mad Max Fury Road.

810
00:58:31,077 --> 00:58:32,041
Guest: I don't know if you know what that yet.

811
00:58:32,484 --> 00:58:38,902
Rym: oh actually I just learned there's a Mad Max convention in Southern California where if you're not dressed up like a mod Mad Max character they don't let you in.

812
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:42,918
Rym: that's hilarious out in the desert it's well.

813
00:58:42,938 --> 00:58:46,155
Scott: there's also the guy in Australia who like made a Mad Max whole like his whole.

814
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:47,803
Scott: his whole property is mad.

815
00:58:47,883 --> 00:58:49,067
Rym: basically lives Mad Max.

816
00:58:49,187 --> 00:58:50,853
Guest: yeah that's crazy.

817
00:58:52,157 --> 00:59:05,982
Guest: the guy yeah you know Inception the movie Inception yeah so the there was the the guy in that who was also a movie called Bronson British guy more a little more like beefier Tom Hardy.

818
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:09,095
Guest: anyway he's gonna be the new Mad Max in Mad Max Fury Road.

819
00:59:09,737 --> 00:59:11,423
Scott: oh so it's not Melvin gibstein.

820
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:13,729
Guest: no I mean I think he's a little out of shape.

821
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:18,122
Scott: yeah some other troubles do.

822
00:59:18,142 --> 00:59:21,913
Guest: yeah exactly I don't know.

823
00:59:22,014 --> 00:59:23,137
Guest: probably a favorite.

824
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,352
Guest: hang on my wife's sitting right here and she's a better memory than me.

825
00:59:25,433 --> 00:59:26,480
Guest: Sarah what's my favorite movie?

00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:35,415
Guest: yeah no she she says Wizard of Oz.

Guest: that's her favorite movie.

828
00:59:36,377 --> 00:59:38,882
Scott: come on not the sequel.

829
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:43,475
Guest: no definitely not a dumb and dumber.

830
00:59:43,495 --> 00:59:44,137
Guest: that's probably it.

831
00:59:44,759 --> 00:59:46,649
Guest: I've watched dumb and dumber probably a million times.

832
00:59:46,689 --> 00:59:47,273
Guest: I can't help it.

833
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:48,721
Guest: it's just it never gets old.

834
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:50,027
Scott: that's fine.

835
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:51,915
Scott: well there's stupid movies.

836
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:52,779
Scott: I watch over and over again.

837
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,753
Guest: thing stupid movies are the best like airplane classic.

838
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:57,602
Scott: I keep the plane top secret lately.

839
00:59:58,185 --> 00:59:59,169
Rym: oh my god top secret.

840
00:59:59,189 --> 00:59:59,993
Rym: I should watch that again.

841
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,380
Scott: yes I've never seen it.

842
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,619
Scott: what really really really really not everyone's seen everything.

843
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:07,603
Rym: everyone's seen everything.

844
01:00:07,643 --> 01:00:09,049
Guest: no I just aged myself.

845
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:10,395
Rym: no I've seen.

846
01:00:10,435 --> 01:00:19,820
Guest: everyone seen it except Scott apparently okay yeah I don't know big nerd so I'm into lots of TV shows too.

847
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:26,174
Guest: we actually a couple years ago I as soon as I discovered what you could do with Torrance I'm not gonna say what that is that you can do.

848
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:26,717
Guest: it's fine.

849
01:00:26,918 --> 01:00:31,322
Guest: I will say that the result of this that discovery is that I disconnected my cable television.

850
01:00:31,824 --> 01:00:33,792
Scott: we also have not had cable television since 2001.

851
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:42,183
Guest: yeah about the same here yeah and and so as a result of that I it's changed the way I I take in media of all forms.

852
01:00:43,446 --> 01:00:45,773
Guest: now it's all that.

853
01:00:45,953 --> 01:00:48,681
Guest: I'm not gonna say I download it but uh it's just.

854
01:00:48,901 --> 01:00:49,745
Guest: there's no more commercials.

855
01:00:49,785 --> 01:00:53,298
Guest: let's put it that way.

856
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:59,230
Guest: and you know instead of sitting down and waiting every week to watch a TV show you you decide oh so there's been seven seasons of bones.

857
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,142
Guest: all right I'm gonna watch all of that this weekend.

858
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:03,432
Scott: mm-hmm you said you like Mad Max.

859
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:06,283
Scott: have you ever watched a show called fists in the North Star?

860
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:09,310
Guest: yes of course I've seen lots and lots of

861
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:09,871
Scott: anime and

862
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:24,213
Guest: actually if you want to get into really geeky stuff when I was in college we used to go to these like when Chan Jackie Chan was first coming with like super cop and and all those ones operation Condor.

863
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:27,003
Guest: remember that those are in the Bronx.

864
01:01:27,826 --> 01:01:30,597
Guest: yes you're in the Bronx and there's a ton of ones like.

865
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:33,695
Guest: there was one like sergeant kabuki man or something like that.

866
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:40,366
Guest: there's all these weird Japanese movies they came out of there that are just amazing like of course drunken master.

867
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:42,217
Guest: you you you have to have seen drunken master.

868
01:01:42,418 --> 01:01:43,944
Rym: I assume you've seen that iron monkey.

869
01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:47,836
Scott: yes how about attack the gas station?

870
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:51,373
Rym: I have not seen no one's ever seen attack the gas station.

871
01:01:51,393 --> 01:01:51,675
Rym: I have.

872
01:01:51,695 --> 01:01:55,439
Scott: so up your I have a feeling attack the gas station will be one of your favorite movies right on.

873
01:01:55,821 --> 01:01:55,981
Scott: it's a.

874
01:01:56,001 --> 01:01:57,928
Guest: have you guys seen have you seen that?

875
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:05,964
Guest: it was like a short sitcom thing that was made for the internet I'm pretty sure they say as a pilot but I don't think it actually was.

876
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:08,594
Guest: with Jack Black and Owen Wilson.

877
01:02:08,615 --> 01:02:10,883
Scott: I'm gonna talk about Tokyo breakfast.

878
01:02:13,072 --> 01:02:18,997
Guest: this is like for some reason when we're just talking about these these weird like funny special effects and wacky premises.

879
01:02:19,017 --> 01:02:20,402
Guest: it reminded me of this.

880
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:28,044
Guest: this show which is about Jack Black was a cop or like an FBI agent or something.

881
01:02:28,064 --> 01:02:30,878
Guest: anyway he got too close to the space space man.

882
01:02:30,919 --> 01:02:39,196
Guest: he got too close to the Sun and it changed his brain and it made him super smart at in a daylight and and really dumb at nighttime or something like that.

883
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:40,985
Scott: and that's okay.

884
01:02:41,025 --> 01:02:42,553
Scott: as long as you sleep all night you'll be.

885
01:02:42,574 --> 01:02:43,297
Scott: you'll be just fine.

886
01:02:43,317 --> 01:02:46,129
Guest: his sidekick is a motorcycle played by Owen Wilson.

887
01:02:47,795 --> 01:02:48,719
Guest: if you have you don't I?

888
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:53,507
Guest: I'm gonna have to find out what this is and give it to you because it is the funniest friggin ridiculous sitcom you'll ever see.

889
01:02:53,789 --> 01:02:59,912
Guest: that sounds right up that alley though of crazy premise and dumb special effects.

890
01:03:00,434 --> 01:03:06,180
Scott: yeah attack the gas station is a is a Korean movie and basically the story is you have some delinquent kids.

891
01:03:06,361 --> 01:03:13,063
Scott: they're not really kids they're a little bit older you know and they didn't go anywhere in life and they're sitting eating some noodles and they say hey what do you want to do?

892
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:13,547
Scott: we're bored.

893
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:15,299
Scott: they say hey let's attack the gas station.

894
01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:19,158
Scott: so they go rob the gas station and then it's just a pretty mundane.

895
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:20,082
Scott: you know robbery?

896
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:20,907
Scott: you know yeah.

897
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:26,977
Scott: and then the movie cuts and they're in the noodle shop again and they're bored again and he says hey what do you want to do?

898
01:03:27,259 --> 01:03:35,241
Scott: let's attack the gas station again and then opening credits and then yet the second time they attack the gas station is far more eventful than the first time right you know?

899
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:41,522
Guest: 90 minutes eventful okay okay I see yeah nice yeah pretty good I'm interested.

900
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:42,669
Guest: I'm gonna have to get that.

901
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:46,567
Rym: I've never met a person who didn't love that movie at least the first showing.

902
01:03:49,556 --> 01:03:50,840
Scott: is there anything else that you you know?

903
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:58,965
Scott: you want to say that we did not give you an opportunity to say sure yeah so my name is Marco Sullivan.

904
01:03:59,206 --> 01:04:06,281
Guest: I'm the founder of vanilla forums which is open source forum soccer that powers discussion on hundreds of thousands of sites around the web.

905
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:16,329
Guest: you can download vanilla at vanilla forums org and you can set up a. so check us out start your community.

906
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,424
Scott: actually I just thought of one more or two more questions.

907
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:20,852
Scott: right used to be called Lucy mo.

908
01:04:20,893 --> 01:04:23,463
Scott: right what happened to Lucy?

909
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:27,472
Guest: my question it's a it's it's an embarrassing question okay?

910
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:36,184
Guest: so so basically I bought you know back in the day when people just bought domain names for the hell of it.

911
01:04:36,265 --> 01:04:38,139
Guest: I guess they still do but they were a lot easier to get.

912
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:53,837
Guest: back then I had a ton of domain names and that was one of the ones that I bought and I ended up using it for a sight I made for my wife not my girlfriend at the time but wife now for Valentine's Day and it was bless you mo.

913
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:54,922
Guest: that's how I pronounced it.

914
01:04:54,962 --> 01:05:01,868
Guest: less you mo was our ugly googly talk to each other and it means love you more as in less you mo.

915
01:05:01,968 --> 01:05:03,011
Rym: no I less you mo.

916
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:06,118
Guest: oh god it's embarrassing.

917
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:10,394
Guest: but so when I made vanilla I was trying to sort of go for this.

918
01:05:10,414 --> 01:05:18,518
Guest: I don't know weird like here's the brand that owns multiple products because vanilla was gonna be the first one and there was a file browser and file browser.

919
01:05:18,618 --> 01:05:19,905
Scott: is the file browser still?

920
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:22,195
Guest: oh really yeah I guess it's weird.

921
01:05:22,236 --> 01:05:23,562
Guest: some people still have it out there.

922
01:05:23,602 --> 01:05:28,946
Guest: but I kind of felt like once once things like Flickr became you know more commonplace.

923
01:05:29,046 --> 01:05:34,155
Scott: and yeah the thing is the reason I use it still is because well actually that you know what actually I used to.

924
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:35,060
Scott: I was using Flickr.

925
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,082
Scott: but Flickr is really only good for your photos that you want to share with people.

926
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:43,370
Scott: right but sometimes you want to post an image usually to then post it in a forum and I need to host it somewhere.

927
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:44,636
Scott: but I want to host it on Flickr.

928
01:05:44,656 --> 01:05:48,498
Scott: so I just upload it to my server and then I had the file browser there.

929
01:05:48,538 --> 01:05:51,894
Scott: so I could find old ones if I needed to read you know just to get a link to them.

930
01:05:52,557 --> 01:05:55,772
Scott: yeah I think imgur is actually had made that sort of obsolete.

931
01:05:56,676 --> 01:06:06,165
Guest: yeah there's there's imgur and then there's also like we're actually doing some stuff for our dot com hosted forums where you can upload files now and the first stage was just getting the files uploaded.

932
01:06:06,226 --> 01:06:08,519
Guest: and now we're gonna have little media repository.

933
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:14,328
Guest: so anybody who uploads files you know they have a little page they can go to to grab the links and all that kind of stuff.

934
01:06:17,036 --> 01:06:18,641
Guest: but so yeah that's where the name came from.

935
01:06:18,661 --> 01:06:24,584
Guest: I needed to use something to umbrella over these products and I had that one laying around.

936
01:06:24,604 --> 01:06:33,772
Guest: so I used it and then over the years it just became more and more difficult to explain to people first of all what it means but even more importantly how the hell do you pronounce it mm-hmm?

937
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:38,355
Scott: and so I didn't think about the pronunciation until just now when I got it wrong.

938
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:39,179
Guest: yeah.

939
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:49,933
Guest: and then what you know and the other turn take it the other way and say oh my domain name is lassi mo comm and everybody like okay and then everybody spells it wrong.

940
01:06:50,053 --> 01:06:56,840
Rym: what you can do is make a legend of Krauser and every time you get interviewed give a different story and then no one will ever know exactly.

941
01:06:57,303 --> 01:06:59,033
Guest: well anyway it's it's sort of gone by the wayside.

942
01:06:59,073 --> 01:07:07,203
Guest: we just realized that vanilla was the name that stuck and it was a name that everybody recognized and you know we had some good domain names for it and it just didn't make sense to hold on to the other one.

943
01:07:07,243 --> 01:07:09,592
Guest: so we just dropped it all right.

944
01:07:10,154 --> 01:07:13,308
Scott: yeah okay I think that's that's pretty much it.

945
01:07:13,348 --> 01:07:14,957
Scott: thanks a lot for coming on the show.

946
01:07:14,977 --> 01:07:15,943
Scott: it was a good time cool.

947
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:17,453
Guest: yeah thank you so much for having me.

948
01:07:17,473 --> 01:07:17,916
Guest: this is fun.

949
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:21,051
Scott: yeah we'll definitely talk again in the future perhaps.

950
01:07:21,212 --> 01:07:32,185
Scott: yeah let me let me know when this goes online and where I can find it and probably we normally would have gone online today but we're going to to PAX this week so it'll probably be Monday next week I guess.

951
01:07:32,326 --> 01:07:33,371
Rym: yeah we got like two panels.

952
01:07:33,412 --> 01:07:33,975
Rym: I gotta finish.

953
01:07:34,035 --> 01:07:36,346
Scott: maybe Monday maybe Monday next week you know.

954
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:37,432
Scott: maybe after we don't know.

955
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:40,487
Guest: are you guys going to blog world in Vegas?

956
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:42,578
Scott: I didn't even know there was a such thing as blog.

957
01:07:42,638 --> 01:07:44,085
Rym: we're going to the penny arcade expo.

958
01:07:45,009 --> 01:07:48,243
Guest: okay I'm just like if if there's any opportunity to hook up we should.

959
01:07:48,504 --> 01:07:55,209
Scott: oh yeah absolutely if you want to go to PAX east it's in Boston net account.

960
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:56,675
Rym: we're trying to get a big tech presence at.

961
01:07:57,317 --> 01:07:57,940
Scott: yeah we could you.

962
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:03,393
Scott: we're in charge of the the the programming at well not all the programming but the panels programming ConnectiCon.

963
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,128
Scott: so maybe we could get them so you could be like a guest or something.

964
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,414
Guest: yeah yeah that'd be cool.

965
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:08,802
Guest: well when when is it?

966
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:09,648
Rym: uh like next year?

967
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:12,183
Scott: it's in the middle of the summer in Hartford Connecticut.

968
01:08:13,025 --> 01:08:16,376
Guest: cool well I guess keep me keep me up to date.

969
01:08:16,417 --> 01:08:18,323
Rym: yeah we only get like seven thousand people.

970
01:08:18,363 --> 01:08:21,901
Rym: it's not like the biggest convention but seven thousand is big.

971
01:08:22,504 --> 01:08:26,783
Rym: no not really Otakon it's like the anime account we go to out here is thirty thousand.

972
01:08:27,528 --> 01:08:31,268
Scott: oh wow yeah okay well that's something else you have to uh something else you have to realize.

973
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:31,569
Scott: like you.

974
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,839
Scott: look at san diego comic-con.

975
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:37,122
Scott: right it's big and famous and they'll tell you an attendance number like a hundred thousand.

976
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:41,444
Scott: they're actually lying because what they do is they're actually giving you a turnstile count.

977
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:49,947
Scott: so if someone goes if someone goes to all three days and preview night so it's wednesday night thursday friday saturday sunday they count that person five times.

978
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:55,455
Scott: so the you know san diego comic-con is the biggest but the true attendance number is probably between 40 and 50 000.

979
01:08:55,455 --> 01:09:00,545
Rym: yeah i mean our little con by if we count it the way like all the vegas cons count is like 20 000 people.

980
01:09:00,947 --> 01:09:05,791
Scott: yeah right right but we're yeah when we count we're actually counting the number of unique individuals.

981
01:09:05,831 --> 01:09:09,432
Scott: so a weekend pass counts as one and a saturday pass counts as one.

982
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:18,340
Scott: the only time we would mess up counting is if somebody bought a saturday pass and a sunday pass we might count them twice and mess up yeah yeah but it's much closer to and plus.

983
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:22,220
Scott: sometimes they count the vendors and don't even get me started.

984
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:25,113
Scott: yeah all right all right now we're actually done.

985
01:09:25,135 --> 01:09:25,859
Scott: i gotta go eat dinner.

986
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:27,990
Scott: okay cool have a good one.

01:09:28,673 --> 01:09:29,296
