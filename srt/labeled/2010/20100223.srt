1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,607
Rym: It's Tuesday February 23rd.

2
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:12,269
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,815
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:17,000
Rym: Why are there no popular griefing games?

5
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:24,727
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:36,278
Rym: You know I was playing Bioshock way back when I bought it And I was also playing fallout 3 and I never finished either game.

7
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:39,575
Scott: I You know it's just something.

8
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:40,140
Scott: those games.

9
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:46,259
Scott: I beat them both, and I bought them both, but you know looking back I should have waited until they were way cheaper than yep.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,293
Scott: well I realized now the other like they're the kind of games where I play.

11
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:53,227
Scott: I just rush through and Well, I realize the full.

12
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:56,680
Rym: the fullness of playing a game like that is unless it's multiplayer.

13
00:00:57,283 --> 00:01:00,900
Rym: You'd might as well just wait and buy it like exactly one generation back.

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:09,200
Rym: So if I Bioshock one now that Bioshock 2 is out by fallout 4 Right after fallout 5 comes out and the main reason is my old computer.

15
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:11,451
Rym: You know all performance stuff aside.

16
00:01:11,693 --> 00:01:13,140
Rym: You know you always say I need more FPA.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,720
Rym: I don't need as nearly as many FPS as I say I do but regardless Fallout 3 was stuttery as crap on that old computer.

18
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:23,314
Rym: So I played through a bunch of it, and it was just kind of like ugly.

19
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:32,097
Rym: I had to turn a lot of the settings down Playing it now on this computer like everything's turned all the way up And it looks great and the games a thousand times more fun, but still not that fun.

20
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:42,940
Scott: I'm sorry Yeah, none of the neither one of those games really fully excited me because I think the big thing that bothered me about Bioshock Right is that you basically you're going through you're doing all right.

21
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,579
Scott: It's a little bit of system shock eNOS, but not so much.

22
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:50,823
Scott: And I you know wish it had co-op because system shock 2 was only good with the co-op yeah But it didn't.

23
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:55,320
Rym: well well well to be fair system shock 2 and games like that filled this.

24
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:59,395
Rym: I don't know like need I had in gaming when I was younger that I no longer had.

25
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:00,800
Scott: I played system shock 2 recently.

26
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,531
Scott: I'd never played it when I was young and it was.

27
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:07,140
Rym: it was pretty great with co-op Yeah, but even by yourself the whole like leveling up and skill trees.

28
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,550
Rym: I cared about that stuff a lot more 10 years ago.

29
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:16,319
Scott: Well the thing is it's like a. you know I I don't really care about leveling up in the skill trees, but it's sort of.

30
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:16,901
Scott: you know It's.

31
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:21,076
Scott: it's when it's a when it's not a grinding situation it can.

32
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:30,980
Scott: it's still kind of fun You know especially because it's that same thing you having like a shmup right and a shmup There's no not really grinding because you're always dodging and shooting and you're constantly using your skills.

33
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:37,210
Scott: But it is fun like when you finally get like six power-ups and the gun Spreads more and now it's just like.

34
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:47,710
Scott: so it gets really hard it gets really hard And then you're able to you get an upgrade and you can hose the enemies down Yeah, and then it's it's like it gets easier and easier But then they just up the difficulty.

35
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,040
Scott: so now you need to get another upgrade and it's this constant.

36
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:59,401
Scott: You know it's like some games like say Mario 1 Super Mario Brothers Or it just gets harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and harder harder, and then you win Yeah,

37
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:01,187
Rym: but when you give you like an expanded

38
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,539
Scott: skill set then there are games where there is there is grinding right?

39
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:09,268
Scott: And the grinding is just sort of like well It's it never really harder or easier.

40
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:22,935
Scott: you just keep playing and playing and doing the same exact thing over and over But in a game that has proper upgrades It's harder and harder and harder And it comes back a little bit easier But not as easy as it was the beginning and then harder and harder and harder and a little bit easier.

41
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:26,366
Scott: and these like moments Of relief and then building difficulty.

42
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:27,589
Scott: you know it makes it.

43
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:36,523
Scott: it makes the climb to the higher difficulties much more Tolerable and it also gives you these sort of fun moments of We.

44
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:44,773
Scott: because like if you just open up say desktop tower defense right as an example And you just choose like sandbox mode where it gives you infinity dollars.

45
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:46,920
Scott: It's completely boring as all fuck.

46
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:52,558
Scott: Just like I'll build the most powerful tower a billion times and that all the bad guys just die instantly.

47
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:53,180
Scott: and who to do?

48
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Rym: But didn't you do that exact same thing when you used to play Civ 2?

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,500
Rym: You put yourself on a giant continent full of perfect land resources And you put every single enemy civilization on a one square island in the middle of the ocean.

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,180
Scott: This is when I was younger and not as smart.

51
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:09,759
Rym: What changed?

52
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,264
Scott: That got boring real fast.

53
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:13,547
Rym: well think what if?

54
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:16,596
Scott: but let's say you're playing desktop tower defense right and it's like.

55
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:25,747
Scott: you know you You play and play and play and it's hard But then you get like a level or two or a couple waves where you've got extra money And it's sort of like we.

56
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:30,047
Scott: I can upgrade a whole bunch and the guys just getting hosed now Yeah, and then it gets hard again.

57
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,673
Scott: You know it's like kentro.

58
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:34,098
Scott: He doesn't fight row every single time He's got a fight.

59
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:38,476
Scott: You know normal schmucks and then fight a hard guy and then normal schmucks you.

60
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:45,819
Rym: one other thing and like Fallout does this pretty well and castle crashers actually did it really well in the beginning where you unlock kind of?

61
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,320
Rym: Advanced functionality like you start unlocking combos and different moves as you you know quote-unquote level up.

62
00:04:51,842 --> 00:05:02,180
Rym: so you're given like a basic skill set like imagine a mario game where you start and you can only do all the basic mario 1 Stuff and then halfway through it's like you figure out how to do the wall jump you figure out how to do the ground pound.

63
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,960
Rym: So it builds upon a skill set, but it introduces them one by one.

64
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:07,466
Scott: That's I kind of wish right.

65
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:14,818
Scott: that street fighter would do that where you know you start the game a street fighter And it's like okay You can punch and you can kick and that's it if you made it

66
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:23,458
Rym: Like some sort of novel game where you have you have Phoenix Wright style But then you fight instead of having courtroom and then as you level up like the fights are just normal fights right

67
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:26,529
Scott: in that Case leveling isn't really a grind what it is.

68
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,035
Scott: It's a. it's a slowly.

69
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:28,677
Scott: It's more.

70
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:29,440
Scott: It's a tutorial.

71
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,000
Scott: You're slowly inter giving the player more abilities so that they can learn to use them one at a time.

72
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:34,926
Scott: And that's actually.

73
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:36,820
Scott: I've been playing a few action games lately.

74
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,592
Scott: I played there's no more heroes game and there's been.

75
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,240
Scott: I played a demo of this Bayonetta game.

76
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:42,245
Rym: I got to play Bayonetta.

77
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:44,133
Rym: everyone says it's great, and I haven't played it yet.

78
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:46,042
Scott: It's just walk around and hit things It's not.

79
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:46,565
Scott: I don't know why.

80
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:49,700
Rym: people I don't know people people I trust have been I don't know.

81
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,702
Scott: I played the demo.

82
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:54,730
Scott: it was walk around and press a and bad guys die is no different than you know.

83
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:57,108
Scott: Brutal legend exactly.

84
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,013
Scott: it's the same exact thing.

85
00:05:58,073 --> 00:05:59,199
Scott: walk around and hit bad guys.

86
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,560
Rym: You know brutal legend at least everyone said that later on and had this cool RTS mechanic.

87
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:08,038
Rym: But are all those hitting guys the whole game all those same people same is.

88
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:10,517
Scott: um What's the game with the guy with the guns?

89
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:20,679
Rym: Devil may cry Same shit now devil may cry way as far as I was concerned was the game of jump in the air and then fall down In slow motion while you shoot guys, that's Bayonetta.

90
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:22,128
Rym: I did that for my Nettie.

91
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,320
Scott: you jump in the air and fall down in slow motion and shoot guys.

92
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,571
Rym: I did that for like three hours, and then I didn't care about.

93
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:27,697
Rym: the rest of devil may cry.

94
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,383
Scott: well They know the same thing.

95
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:34,220
Scott: anyway the point is in these games right especially like no more heroes for example.

96
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,725
Scott: Right this is tutorial.

97
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:40,780
Scott: at the beginning of the game the tutorial teaches you every single move that you have right away.

98
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,467
Scott: Okay, so it's like you learn.

99
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,713
Scott: It's like okay first.

100
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:45,677
Scott: Here's how to hit a guy.

101
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:47,968
Scott: okay now He's here has that charge up and hit a guy.

102
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:52,590
Scott: it just teaches you them all one after the other immediately And then it says okay now play the game.

103
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,760
Rym: It's like no no no no no no no no think about it.

104
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,229
Rym: Though who does that cater to imagine?

105
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,060
Rym: you like imagine FPS?

106
00:06:58,621 --> 00:06:59,625
Rym: We're good at FPS.

107
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:06,136
Rym: if I play a new FPS once I know the controls I can do all the crazy stuff unless the game does something really you know.

108
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:06,458
Rym: weird.

109
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:07,607
Scott: no They got to give you.

110
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,973
Scott: if it's a single-player FPS They give you one weapon at a time like here's the pistol.

111
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:13,400
Scott: learn how to use the secondary?

112
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,721
Scott: It's not.

113
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:14,806
Scott: what is the crowbar?

114
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:15,629
Scott: what is the grab?

115
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:18,040
Rym: there was an FPS where they were like all right?

116
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,569
Rym: You can you can only turn and walk and shoot.

117
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,597
Rym: you cannot strafe yet, and then later.

118
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:23,240
Rym: They're like all right.

119
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:24,666
Rym: You've gotten good enough.

120
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:25,389
Rym: We're gonna teach you.

121
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:26,493
Rym: move in you straight.

122
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:26,774
Rym: Well.

123
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:27,377
Scott: That's you know.

124
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:28,100
Scott: That's basics.

125
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,571
Rym: It's the same thing no.

126
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:31,398
Scott: It's not cuz same.

127
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:32,122
Scott: no It's not.

128
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,770
Scott: there's basics, and then there's everything.

129
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,265
Scott: you have to teach all the basics at the beginning But you don't teach everything.

130
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:37,726
Scott: not.

131
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:44,727
Scott: there's basic moves that are fundamental to playing and then there are moves that are not Fundamental to playing that are advanced moves right.

132
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:51,088
Scott: so in half-life you need to teach moving which includes strafing aiming I'm not saying half.

133
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:52,499
Rym: imagine some other kind of FPF.

134
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:52,961
Rym: Maybe.

135
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:59,609
Rym: maybe it's an FPS where you're piloting a robot, and you just don't have the strafe capability yet Because the rate is a basic capability.

136
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,292
Scott: It would be okay.

137
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:04,110
Scott: If you don't have the double jump capability It's not an absolute basic capability.

138
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:05,760
Scott: strafe is a basic capability.

139
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,508
Rym: You're saying that you have no like.

140
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:11,847
Scott: objective stance on a basic capability means It's fundamental to the game.

141
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:14,579
Scott: your you know movement period is a basic.

142
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:15,443
Scott: Imagine.

143
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:17,330
Rym: you're good already good at these.

144
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,000
Rym: walk around beat-em-up kill guys by pressing a kinds of games.

145
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:24,450
Rym: So if you play a new one Do you really want to start where you've only got three moves?

146
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,691
Rym: you got to go through all this BS with these three moves Before they give you like all the crazy combo.

147
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:31,043
Scott: to go through all this BS You just have to.

148
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:37,546
Scott: the scheduling of when the moves are you know granted to you and taught to you has to be spread Out proper like you know.

149
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:42,164
Scott: you know it doesn't mean that you're gonna have to beat ten levels before you can get the strafe Right.

150
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,318
Scott: it could you just give it to them.

151
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,236
Rym: You know you're just.

152
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:44,641
Rym: I mean It's.

153
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,429
Rym: it's the same thing just on a different scale.

154
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:50,951
Rym: for someone who's really into games like this already This game is aimed more at them.

155
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:56,480
Rym: if it gives you all this stuff right off the bat I mean someone who's never played a walk around hit people game before is gonna be overwhelmed.

156
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,103
Rym: They're like what?

157
00:08:57,626 --> 00:08:59,395
Rym: what's all this tutorial and all these million things?

158
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,240
Rym: don't remember all of them.

159
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,599
Rym: If you care about this kind of game, they give you everything you care about and then you go nuts with it.

160
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:06,023
Scott: No, it's not.

161
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:07,066
Rym: It's prop.

162
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:16,336
Scott: notice how the best games right the games on your eyes the games that are the most popular and Consistently the highest rated and most enjoyable are games like Farmville.

163
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,251
Scott: No That's not getting good reviews in the game right, but even Farmville right.

164
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,240
Scott: Farmville does this where it teaches you things one by one.

165
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,910
Scott: It's like here's plowing all right.

166
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,057
Scott: Here's harvesting.

167
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:28,445
Scott: okay now Here's how to use the.

168
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:28,826
Scott: you know.

169
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,700
Scott: there they constantly build up the number of things that you can do.

170
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,842
Scott: They don't just start you with everything they build you up Right.

171
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,969
Scott: they teach you more and more things as you go on.

172
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,254
Scott: harvest moon even does that.

173
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,177
Scott: but it's like okay.

174
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:42,040
Rym: player game a game Or you will be competing with other players.

175
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,275
Rym: Do you want to have to go through all that just to play against other people?

176
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:46,420
Scott: well if it's a multiplayer?

177
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,294
Scott: This is why the best multiplayer games are ones that have single-player games attached to them.

178
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:55,073
Scott: even tribes 2 has a Single-player game in which you may learn the things that you need to know to play tribes.

179
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:56,718
Rym: to remember when that died you can.

180
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:57,601
Rym: it's very specific.

181
00:09:57,621 --> 00:10:00,110
Scott: counter-strike had half-life in which you could learn to play.

182
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,331
Scott: count.

183
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:09,580
Rym: but think back it was when quake 3 came out and they Were like look we made quake 3 But we didn't bother with the single-player because no one cares still was a single-player.

184
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,020
Scott: So you could learn to play quake, but the single-player was just multiplayer with bots.

185
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,936
Scott: Yes, but it allowed you to learn, but I do.

186
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:20,769
Scott: Quake 3 did lack a tutorial which was sort of bad.

187
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:30,009
Rym: quake 3 assumed that the that everyone who care about FPS is Already played FPS and was just waiting for quake 3 to come out And they were just gonna all play quake 3 instead of quake 3.

188
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,696
Scott: this is why quake live is much better.

189
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,784
Scott: quake live actually has A proper tutorial.

190
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:38,380
Rym: yep of course it doesn't teach you how to do some of that advanced stuff at the end.

191
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,046
Rym: It just says if you can do it.

192
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,993
Rym: We put you in a higher difficulty echelon.

193
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:42,896
Rym: Yeah, remember.

194
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:43,940
Rym: It gives you that long corridor.

195
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,508
Rym: It's like if you've rocket jump down.

196
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,277
Scott: I could never make it all the way to the end.

197
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:47,779
Rym: You know what?

198
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:50,164
Rym: I could not.

199
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:55,266
Scott: I could only make it to write that there's only one more test than the one with all the walls that came Down from the ceiling right.

200
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:55,568
Scott: was that?

201
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:55,830
Scott: was it.

202
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:57,420
Rym: Yeah, the thing is I'm not even hardcore.

203
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:05,646
Rym: I mean I could bunny hop in quake 2 but in quake 1 I wasn't that good at it and everyone who played quake 1 would say yeah quake 2 they dumb down the bunny hopping cuz people Couldn't do it.

204
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:10,632
Scott: hmm Whatever yeah, so news is well.

205
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:11,717
Rym: You know we keep.

206
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,036
Rym: we've been saying forever There should be a Pokemon MMO.

207
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:19,340
Rym: the day They make the Pokemon MMO is the day GeekNights ends, and I play an MMO for the rest of my life.

208
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,320
Scott: That's just another one of those items on the checklist of game companies not fulfilling their potential.

209
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,724
Scott: It's like well.

210
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:31,460
Scott: You could do this and make a billion dollars But instead you just incrementally update existing franchises with minor changes and sell them for $50.

211
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,079
Rym: I mean you guys know us we hate MMOs And we don't even like Pokemon that much.

212
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:40,240
Rym: But damn if I wouldn't play it a Pokemon MMO if it was the definitive.

213
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:41,547
Rym: And this is it.

214
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:51,016
Rym: if I level up a pokey man in this game It is my pokey man and every pokey man forever And I can never gonna make some new pokey man series that I can't transfer up to.

215
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:52,865
Rym: you know yep And you're gonna.

216
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:54,800
Rym: Let me talk to people like an adult.

217
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:56,346
Rym: Yeah, I need that.

218
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:59,880
Rym: I need to be able to actually say the word penis to other people while I'm playing.

219
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,600
Rym: That's I don't need to be able to name my Pokemon penis and know that while they can't see the Pokemon's name.

220
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:13,459
Rym: I know the name But they finally did not know no digimon MMO.

221
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,127
Scott: Ah All right, but I you know.

222
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:19,536
Scott: all I know is that digimon was copy and Pokemon.

223
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:20,640
Scott: I don't know anything else about it.

224
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,175
Scott: I know that some people actually like it.

225
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:26,371
Scott: Well, here's the deal if it's good or bad or what people like the Pokemon games.

226
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:31,651
Rym: for Pokemon people may or may not like the anime The the lifers as penny arcade calls it.

227
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:33,057
Rym: you know that kids got six pikachu's.

228
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:33,700
Rym: he can't lose.

229
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:40,677
Rym: Those kids watch the anime and probably read the comics and play the game.

230
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:41,480
Rym: they care about all of them.

231
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,660
Rym: But I think most Pokemon people don't care about the anime at all if they even know it exists.

232
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,039
Rym: Or maybe they they vaguely know, but they pretty much just play the game.

233
00:12:49,822 --> 00:13:05,736
Rym: But digimon I feel like most people either don't like the game don't care about the game don't know about the game But they like the cartoon because the cartoon is a lot darker than the Pokemon cartoon a lot more serious And there's a lot of at least according to bay image a lot more digimon porn.

234
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:08,007
Rym: I don't know what that says about Mean.

235
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,199
Scott: there's a lot more digimon porn on Bay image.

236
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:17,060
Rym: Yeah Well, I think there are a lot more digimon that are like Lucario or the bunny Pokemon.

237
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:21,956
Scott: Yeah, the thing is whenever I look at artwork of digimon I'm like yeah, those are completely not appealing in any way.

238
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:24,616
Scott: shape or form 50/50 half and the thing is right.

239
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:25,642
Scott: Pokemon It's like.

240
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:30,420
Scott: sure I might have an emotional attachment to old Pokemon, but even new Pokemon are awesome.

241
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,409
Scott: It's like man spirits whom check that shit out fuck.

242
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:33,675
Scott: Yeah, but combi.

243
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:34,760
Scott: That's a new Pokemon fuck.

244
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,455
Rym: Cannot deny that Pokemon has moved more toward more complex and sometimes human.

245
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:41,120
Rym: I don't like every Pokemon.

246
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:46,184
Scott: I'm saying they're moving toward that but I feel like I mean it would be hard to like every digimon I've ever seen.

247
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,480
Scott: I don't like but if there are you know they're a good Pokemon.

248
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:48,922
Scott: They're a bad.

249
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:52,435
Scott: Pokemon said there are no good digimon at least as far as I've seen.

250
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:57,274
Scott: see the trouble is think there's a good Poke of get a digimon that I will like send it on over.

251
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:57,856
Rym: Here's the thing.

252
00:13:58,097 --> 00:13:58,920
Rym: I thought the same thing.

253
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:10,537
Rym: I was thinking about digimon and I started looking online just had pictures of digimon that weren't porn and I realized that my image of what a digimon looks like in no way matches the vast majority of digimon.

254
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:12,659
Scott: now mine mine matches The way did you man look?

255
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:17,080
Rym: Pokemon I guess I'm used to seeing these vaguely humanoid big deal.

256
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:19,126
Scott: I'm just in all sorts of digimon.

257
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:23,820
Rym: what I'm used to seeing from digimon is the equivalent of just the epic Pokemon from Pokemon.

258
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:31,991
Scott: Now yeah, I guess if you only looked at Pokemon right based on the ones that are on the covers of the boxes You know yeah, and you wouldn't you.

259
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:38,551
Scott: but then I went looked and most of the digimon are more Pokemon like a lot of them are but I still none of them are.

260
00:14:38,913 --> 00:14:45,098
Rym: I don't like like a more complex Pidgeot But he's got a belt over his forehead for some reason, and he's holding something.

261
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:50,013
Rym: yeah But the digimon MMO came, but not the Pokemon MMO.

262
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:50,554
Rym: well.

263
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:55,250
Rym: Oh well before anyone even bothers I figured out the deal in Korea.

264
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,758
Rym: There is a digimon RPG.

265
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:58,460
Rym: It's a free area.

266
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,187
Scott: They have everything.

267
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:31,718
Rym: it's a free-to-play MMO that's based on digimon and it's been around since like 2002. and apparently the digimon battle this MMO of digimon that's coming out in March in the u.s.. According to this European gamers blog quote digimon Battle is the Western revamp of digimon RPG a free-to-play Korean MMO that's been around since 2002 and This explains why all the screenshots and character designs and models and everything from this digimon MMO Look a little bit old and a little bit hokey.

268
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:34,909
Rym: because this games old and hokey and that they're just revamping it uh-huh.

269
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:43,379
Rym: So what I wonder is does this game follow the format that every Korean MMO does where the game is mostly free And then they charge you like for five bucks.

270
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,050
Rym: You can add a red color to your guy for ten bucks.

271
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,243
Rym: You can sit down for ten bucks.

272
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:49,410
Scott: You can get some digit steroids.

273
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:51,977
Rym: So, I'm really curious if they follow.

274
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:57,030
Scott: I think though what we should consider right is there's probably a hundred Korean MMOs right out there.

275
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,630
Scott: We could just buy one of them from the company that made it and call it real game.

276
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:05,630
Scott: I revamp it for the US and make money without having to write our own MMO.

277
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:10,950
Rym: The thing is that market space is already pretty crowded unless you associated with some property.

278
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,903
Rym: I mean digimon is relatively pop prop like popular among kids.

279
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:15,310
Rym: Pokemon is really popular.

280
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:18,164
Rym: You have to tie it into some franchise the kids care about.

281
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,937
Rym: we can get some sort of license But what he gets care about other than Pokemon?

282
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:25,227
Scott: spongebob spongebob MMO, huh?

283
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:26,210
Scott: Take a Korean MMO.

284
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:27,825
Scott: Just take on Bob.

285
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:32,670
Rym: Forget about just take gun bound and call it like sponge bound.

286
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:34,717
Rym: Yeah, and just change all that.

287
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:36,583
Rym: make everything look like spongebob characters.

288
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:38,068
Rym: There you go million dollars.

289
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:40,119
Rym: Yep Maybe we should just do that.

290
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,569
Rym: Why am I working at some job?

291
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,150
Scott: Because you need a lot of money to buy the spongebob license.

292
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,063
Scott: Yeah, yeah, unless I could be had the money to buy the spongebob license.

293
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:54,230
Scott: You wouldn't make the spongebob MMO retired tropical paradise exactly.

294
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,730
Rym: So, yeah digimon MMO not excited about it, but it should be the Pokemon in the bow, right?

295
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:05,945
Scott: So I did I talk about Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone on the show.

296
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:06,869
Rym: I don't think so.

297
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,823
Scott: I don't know if I did but they're making Street Fighter 4 for the iPhone Which is now that I kind of know how to play.

298
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:20,368
Rym: Street Fighter 4 is like wow Well, here's the question will they make an interface such that you can have a full-size Bluetooth stick that you carry with you?

299
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:27,069
Scott: No, you just sort of use the touchscreen and it looks like there's only four attacking buttons and then you know a touch stick.

300
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:30,138
Scott: You know You move your finger around this area and that counts.

301
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:43,141
Scott: the real question is will it include all the stuff that's in Street Fighter like Tekken in and out of it has eight characters and apparently those eight characters have the full of their full move set and it Has you know super bars and the whole thing.

302
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:43,443
Scott: it just.

303
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:45,150
Scott: it seems like they've taken out.

304
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:47,410
Scott: You know, there's only four attack buttons.

305
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,266
Scott: so it's light strong light strong instead of light medium strong light medium strong the punch and kick.

306
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:53,531
Scott: and other than that it looks like It's.

307
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:58,308
Scott: everyone has all their special moves and everything and there's a video here of someone playing it.

308
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,220
Scott: and I'm just like Who?

309
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,334
Scott: Who's who's gonna play this?

310
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:06,570
Rym: the same people who buy like the avatar game on the pre for eight bucks?

311
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:12,374
Scott: But I mean anyone who actually cares about Street Fighter is like, yeah this doesn't count and You're funny.

312
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:14,380
Scott: Anyone doesn't care about Street Fighter is not gonna play it.

313
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:17,190
Rym: You're forgetting the weird, you know, there's people like us.

314
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:22,289
Rym: Well, I like me at least who don't play fighting games and like did the Capcom people who made this game?

315
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,470
Scott: Have they played it and like, you know actually like tested it out and realized it's a horribly uncomfortable?

316
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,201
Rym: Well think of this class one people who are actually good at Street Fighter.

317
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:33,404
Rym: They won't play this.

318
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:35,330
Rym: Yeah, they just won't they don't care.

319
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:37,659
Rym: Class number two people like me.

320
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,948
Rym: I'm not good at Street Fighter and I never planned to me.

321
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,293
Rym: So I don't care It doesn't matter.

322
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:51,589
Rym: but I'm also savvy enough to know not to buy games on the iPhone Unless I know that they're good independent of some stupid licenses tied to them and I highly doubt this will be good.

323
00:18:52,551 --> 00:19:01,650
Rym: Class three people who know what Street Fighter is played Occasionally have iPhones and just buy a ton of games on their iPhones because they like to have games on their iPhones.

324
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:04,019
Rym: They're not hardcore, so they don't care about the.

325
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,890
Scott: I just don't know how many of those people would buy.

326
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:09,451
Scott: You know Street Fighter 4.

327
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:16,209
Rym: I'm pretty sure it'll be enough because I don't think any of the people involved in this would be stupid enough to release it Unless they knew they'd recoup their losses.

328
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:23,330
Rym: Unless this is a situation where someone who didn't know better went to the company said look we want to license Street Fighter to do blah.

329
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:27,165
Rym: And they said you know what give us the license money and have fun.

330
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:29,394
Scott: Well Capcom made this I'm pretty sure so.

331
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:30,779
Rym: but what happened internally?

332
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,585
Rym: may I'm for all you know, something weird.

333
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,850
Rym: shenanigans happened internally.

334
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:34,654
Scott: They're probably just like.

335
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,799
Scott: well, we got to get on the iPhone.

336
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:36,562
Scott: How about Street Fighter 4?

337
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:39,776
Scott: Alright, let's do it Should've made, you know Megaman instead.

338
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:41,904
Scott: I don't know Megaman 9.

339
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:43,370
Scott: I don't know is Megaman even on the iPhone?

340
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:44,537
Rym: I have no idea wasn't?

341
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:50,159
Rym: it was on the bunch of other weird Put on Puzzle Fighter or Megaman battle that didn't?

342
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:54,630
Rym: they sell Megaman on the the engage way back I don't remember.

343
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:01,684
Rym: I was pretty sure there was some Megaman that was on the engage and I remember thinking wow If the engage weren't the worst thing in the world, I would consider this.

344
00:20:01,704 --> 00:20:13,616
Rym: I don't remember Things of the day.

345
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:18,632
Rym: as I fall back to using College Humor because it's easy All right.

346
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:19,114
Rym: Yep.

347
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:24,490
Rym: So College Humor has this whole this video of some TV show or maybe more than one TV shows.

348
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:25,294
Rym: I can't tell.

349
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:26,580
Rym: I don't watch TV.

350
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,289
Rym: I don't even know what show this is from.

351
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:30,340
Scott: Say in the comments or the.

352
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:34,110
Rym: it didn't say in the title It just said TV without the green screen.

353
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,421
Rym: But basically all it is is clips from TV shows showing back and forth.

354
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:43,665
Rym: What is green screen and what isn't and It's just kind of interesting to see.

355
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:50,306
Rym: you know Shows and backdrops and things juxtaposed with how much of it is actually just a composited image.

356
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:56,770
Rym: paste it onto a green screen Yep, and if you doubt how extensively these things are used nowadays.

357
00:20:57,672 --> 00:21:05,710
Rym: I submit to you the fact that as far as I can tell the old movie Bruce almighty Had almost zero sets and the entire movie was filmed in front of like one green screen.

358
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,864
Rym: They just made scenes in the background later.

359
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:18,310
Rym: Mm-hmm I thought this was cool and I totally copped out because I have a better thing in the day that I'm saving Get someone to listen to every episode maybe or just check the website.

360
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,628
Scott: So, you know people we keep talking about, you know tablets this and that right.

361
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,857
Scott: so Apparently there's a company.

362
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:30,717
Scott: they made something called the boogie board and It's so popular.

363
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:32,570
Scott: just keeps selling out and you can't get one.

364
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,229
Scott: But you know when they're not sold out you can buy one on Amazon and I'm not even sure what the price is because I can't.

365
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,575
Scott: They're sold out on Amazon.

366
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:40,385
Rym: So how much do they go for on like eBay?

367
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:41,330
Scott: That's a good question.

368
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,650
Scott: Let me check eBay, but basically what this thing is is it's an LCD screen, right?

369
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,425
Scott: That's only one color green, you know, usually an L sell LCD screen.

370
00:21:49,485 --> 00:21:50,730
Scott: Each pixel is red green blue.

371
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:52,950
Scott: This is just green green green, right?

372
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:56,257
Scott: Uh Let's see boogie board on eBay.

373
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:00,250
Scott: So the it's also a tablet so you can draw on it.

374
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,382
Scott: All right, it has a button that resets it and makes the whole thing black.

375
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:05,410
Scott: Uh-huh, and that's it.

376
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,779
Scott: It doesn't like out as far as I can tell.

377
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,963
Scott: it doesn't output to.

378
00:22:09,184 --> 00:22:15,784
Scott: you know Anything anything, you know, it's basically just a pad that does not require.

379
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:15,905
Scott: Okay.

380
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:19,158
Scott: It's a hundred and I see Oh, there's one for 50 wait.

381
00:22:19,198 --> 00:22:26,185
Rym: Wait, so clearly whatever this thing does There's a market or maybe there's one for $26 so it can get really cheap.

382
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:27,108
Scott: is one for $20 new in box?

383
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:29,685
Rym: So here's my my thoughts.

384
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:35,052
Rym: one The reason you're finding them cheap is because while they're popular people realize right away They're useless.

385
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:40,330
Rym: and two there is a market for the same thing with a USB hole on the side.

386
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:52,254
Scott: Well, I do think that if they added the ability to just you know export a JPEG Let's give it an SD slot or something and let someone give it one more button and that button will save the current Image to the SD.

387
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:53,038
Rym: give it two more buttons.

388
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:55,910
Rym: Let it load images from an SD and display them.

389
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:57,518
Scott: Yeah, but they could only be one color.

390
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,530
Scott: So what would it do if you gave it like a multicolored ping?

391
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,279
Rym: It'll only load images that are the right format.

392
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:09,270
Rym: use that to save your gigantic penis and then you show it to people When you're standing at a concert and you hold it up like, you know, we people used to hold up light.

393
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,558
Scott: Basically, what's cool about this?

394
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,683
Scott: right is like the makes me kind of want one But I'm still not gonna buy one until they have the saving ability.

395
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:17,054
Scott: if they ever add the saving ability Huh is that?

396
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:23,394
Scott: you know, basically as a battery it lasts for fucking ever and you just don't need pens Or or paper.

397
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:34,010
Scott: you can just draw and erase and draw and erase and draw on a race like, you know if you're Like I wouldn't need a pad on my desk at work Like if I just had one of these I wouldn't have to keep going down the office supply cabinet or use pens.

398
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:37,234
Rym: It's useful for me.

399
00:23:37,274 --> 00:23:37,596
Rym: at least.

400
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:45,570
Rym: I have my previous days shit laying around so every day I flip to a new page so I can go back and look at what did I write down on Monday?

401
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:46,599
Rym: That might have been important.

402
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:52,285
Scott: Oh, yeah Like if I sit there all day doodling why should I waste pens and paper doodling?

403
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:54,172
Rym: Well, well, well You know what?

404
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:57,625
Scott: This is if you're playing like an RPG a tabletop RPG, right?

405
00:23:57,946 --> 00:24:03,204
Scott: You can draw like, okay You're here and the other guy's there, you know, and why should you waste paper?

406
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:05,170
Rym: Remember at Katsucon way back?

407
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:13,962
Rym: We were running the old-school retro video arcade and we had all those prizes to give out and one of them was that Okami Like Buddha board.

408
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:15,170
Rym: I forget exactly what it was called.

409
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:20,770
Rym: It was just a piece of rock that was flat like slate and a thing for water.

410
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:32,286
Rym: All right, right and you can draw on it with water and an image would appear But then it would eventually dry up and go away so that the point was you would draw But whatever you drew was by nature ephemeral and was the same sort.

411
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:33,270
Scott: This is the same sort of thing.

412
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,750
Rym: It's just that thing made digital.

413
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,229
Rym: So you probably don't actually want to save function because that makes it something entirely different from what it is.

414
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:44,653
Scott: Yeah, but you know having it would be different from what it is A better thing.

415
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:45,617
Scott: that would be more useful.

416
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:47,623
Scott: I mean one of the examples.

417
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:54,133
Scott: one of the examples they show here though is Like, you know doing some math, you know Like homeworks.

418
00:24:54,474 --> 00:25:05,489
Scott: and they show an example of like drawing a football play like if you're the coach you'd be like, alright guys You know, you know, you do a wideout you do it cross over, you know, and then push the erase button, you know Cuz it's not something you actually need to save.

419
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:10,910
Scott: So, you know if the price really is this low like friggin 20 bucks, right?

420
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:14,141
Scott: You know $20 new in box on eBay one bid.

421
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:16,890
Scott: Well, it's got six days left and they're sold out on Amazon.

422
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:21,410
Scott: I think the reason they're sold out is because just they're so ridiculously cheap right for an LCD screen.

423
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,981
Scott: That's a tablet you can draw on and push that have an erase button.

424
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:25,970
Rym: I wonder how sensitive it is all that stuff.

425
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,752
Rym: I wonder if you can.

426
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:28,538
Scott: it looks it looks pretty sensitive.

427
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:31,547
Rym: are people buying them really to mod them into other things.

428
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:39,837
Scott: Oh I just you know, maybe I should buy two and try to hack an SD slot onto one of them and You know if I could.

429
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:43,090
Rym: that's hard to say cuz it probably just has some kind of direct output.

430
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,556
Rym: I mean, I don't know what kind of chips are in there.

431
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,524
Rym: It might not have anywhere.

432
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,010
Rym: You could easily get data off of it.

433
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,175
Scott: Yeah, it might require like that.

434
00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:52,210
Scott: You actually add a bunch of electronics to it that it doesn't have.

435
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,081
Scott: Yeah, it might be a tree might increase the price like fourfold to add that functionality Cuz it would need.

436
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:57,930
Rym: I mean it might just have one.

437
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,102
Rym: I see that stores like all the pixel data and then just then.

438
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,644
Scott: that'd be really easy cuz you would just need to read from It and write it to.

439
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:07,741
Scott: you know You know any sort of storage and that's it.

440
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:09,270
Scott: you just need to add an SD controller.

441
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:12,181
Rym: Yeah, but depending on if it's nice see there's like solder down to some.

442
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:13,366
Scott: so these are 20 bucks.

443
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:14,210
Scott: Why not buy two?

444
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:17,701
Rym: Yeah, why not buy all of them have a monopoly?

445
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:20,330
Rym: I think this is why they're sold out and then sell them on eBay.

446
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:22,320
Scott: They're already being sold on eBay.

447
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,990
Scott: But anyway, I just you know, it's my thing of the day.

448
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,949
Scott: It's a. it's a thing you might want one.

449
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:33,445
Rym: so I want to take the time to read at least much of The post that caused me to come up with what we want to talk about.

450
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:34,470
Scott: people can read it themselves.

451
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,698
Scott: You're gonna read a whole post.

452
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:45,750
Rym: I want to skip through it because I basically I Realized that this sounds exactly like someone I know if you change all the proper nouns And this is someone asking slash job something about gaming.

453
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:50,590
Rym: I have a slightly older friend who plays through the glory days of Ultima online.

454
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:55,450
Rym: Yes, their servers are still up and running but he waxes nostalgic about certain gameplay functions of you.

455
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,192
Rym: Oh that he misses.

456
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:01,430
Rym: I must say that these aspects make me smile and wonder what it would be like to play in such a world.

457
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:03,821
Rym: Things like housing thieving and looting.

458
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:04,826
Scott: they don't have those anymore.

459
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:05,630
Scott: I thought they still had those.

460
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,280
Rym: None of that stuff is in World of Warcraft.

461
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:08,790
Scott: No, but it's in Ultima online, right?

462
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,764
Rym: Yeah, all them online has all that stuff still.

463
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:11,510
Scott: So why is he wag?

464
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,190
Rym: It doesn't need to wax nostalgia cuz it's an old busted game that hardly anyone plays.

465
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:26,409
Rym: So I followed him through a few games like Darkfall and mortal online and these games are consistently failing of pop Fading into obscurity and never catching hold.

466
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,756
Rym: We constantly move from one to the next.

467
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:34,350
Rym: does anyone know of a popular three-dimensional game that has you oh like rules and gameplay?

468
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:41,920
Rym: and he goes on to talk about all the stuff he likes about Ultima online and Basically his point seems to be that old school MMO.

469
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:47,350
Rym: Ultima online Was a different kind of game from modern MMOs like World of Warcraft that are popular.

470
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:51,042
Rym: He likes the old MMOs and he doesn't like the new ones.

471
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:55,216
Rym: He wants to know if there's anything to play now, man I really like those old hardcore.

472
00:27:55,437 --> 00:27:57,624
Scott: FPS is not unlike these newfangled wussy.

473
00:27:57,684 --> 00:27:59,370
Scott: Halo ones are too bad.

474
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:01,169
Scott: No one's making games for me anymore.

475
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:02,714
Rym: Is this not just me?

476
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:03,838
Rym: he even goes further.

477
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,790
Rym: Darkfall mortal online all these games that do what he wants and then fail.

478
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,506
Rym: quake live.

479
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:13,375
Scott: Yeah, basically I wonder why these games fail.

480
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:18,190
Scott: the same reason that like tribes to release today would fail because it's too complicated for anyone to play.

481
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:22,523
Rym: Realize that everything I say about FPS is and what I want and how.

482
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:24,970
Rym: I realize that that is not viable in the modern market.

483
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:28,823
Rym: There are people in every other gaming genre who feel the exact same way.

484
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:33,510
Rym: They look at old RTS's and say wow Everything back then was awesome and everything today.

485
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:41,541
Scott: So I think actually RTS people are pleased because you know, they have someone serving them, you know Starcraft 2 isn't serving like the mass market.

486
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:42,264
Scott: Starcraft 2 is.

487
00:28:42,284 --> 00:28:43,710
Scott: so yeah the hardcore.

488
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:48,627
Rym: Well, I guess part of that is that Korea is kind of like an Eastern Roman Empire.

489
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:49,470
Rym: it's a Byzantium.

490
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,501
Scott: It's a place where there's just just the mass market is hardcore.

491
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:56,370
Rym: It is it's a Byzantium of RTS's, you know the West fell.

492
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:03,470
Rym: RTS's fell here except for a few holdouts and barbarians everywhere playing like brutal legend with quote RTS elements.

493
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:18,465
Rym: But in Korea, they've got walls around this old-school city of people who play real old-school RTS's and the Renaissance never will happen because Korea will never fall Mmm, but of course if Korea fell there's wouldn't ever be RTS's again.

494
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,532
Scott: in terms of FPS's, you know There's not to.

495
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:27,576
Scott: you know, the percentage of people who are hardcore into FPS is still is relatively small Compared to the people are into.

496
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:28,077
Scott: you know.

497
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:33,810
Scott: halos and calls of duty are selling way way more than you know quakes and such.

498
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:36,643
Rym: Well, look at East Asia FPS's are not super popular.

499
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:45,589
Rym: No, they're popular in the Europe where the FPS's are hot and in Europe too apparently is where these old weird style MMOs that no one likes anymore keep coming out of.

500
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:56,878
Rym: And I also note that a lot of our own friends in the crew who like those old-school kind of games They always tell me about like Darkfall like all these games that come out They're like, yeah, this is gonna be the best MMO ever.

501
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,907
Scott: It'll destroy Wow, and no one plays.

502
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:06,030
Scott: Yeah Yeah Nothing's gonna destroy right the games that appeal to the mass market and make more money is what people are gonna make and no one.

503
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:10,890
Scott: You know if you want to make an MMO the problem with an MMO as opposed to some other game, right?

504
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,730
Scott: It's like even though we talk about hardcore FPS's people still make them, you know.

505
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:21,070
Scott: Not a lot of people play them But people still make them and the reason that people still make them is because you only have to make it and then it's it's set.

506
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:25,446
Scott: It's like you can still play tribes - there's some open-source hardcore FPS's out there, you know.

507
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:30,350
Scott: and But an MMO requires a lot of money and servers to keep up.

508
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:33,767
Scott: Even if there aren't a lot of players you still have to have a server.

509
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:38,961
Scott: and you know It's much more Technologically intensive even though the game is.

510
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:44,524
Scott: I mean look what hand mechanics are simple But the 3d and the whole thing it's like the guy specifically said 3d.

511
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:48,762
Scott: he could get the exact game He wants with players in a mud, right?

512
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:49,646
Scott: It exists out there.

513
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:50,871
Scott: He could play it right now You know what?

514
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,457
Rym: He could play the realm.

515
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:55,027
Rym: It's still up the fans of the realm.

516
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:57,941
Rym: the first MMO Well the first graphical MMO, you know.

517
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,630
Scott: modern playing Ultima online.

518
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:14,793
Scott: Yeah Why does he need to play something, you know his insistence on it being a 3d one Means that it's not going to exist because for such a thing to exist It would have to be popular enough to pay for it and to be popular enough to pay for it It would have to not have the mechanics He wants.

519
00:31:14,994 --> 00:31:23,344
Rym: but at least with the realm the fans that were left there weren't that many Actually bought the rights to the game and maintained the server at their own expense Mm-hmm.

520
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:30,737
Rym: And as far as I can tell there's a small community of really really weird people who play the realm Regularly to this day.

521
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:32,565
Rym: Yeah, so I'd still up and everything.

522
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:42,650
Rym: but you know There's a whole bunch discussion on slashdot and I went to like this guy's blog and other people's blogs And I followed this thread for a couple hours and I realized something really interesting.

523
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:49,569
Rym: Everything I liked about MMOs back when I played MMOs does not exist in modern MMOs.

524
00:31:49,932 --> 00:32:00,490
Rym: however everything that I liked in old MMOs basically boiled down to Griefing and the and not just griefing but all the like accoutrement of griefing.

525
00:32:00,691 --> 00:32:08,010
Rym: I mean in the realm I ground up my guy, you know I had to grind up to get like level 60 70 80 with my gold Baldrick and all that bullshit.

526
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:09,680
Rym: I didn't like grinding.

527
00:32:09,781 --> 00:32:10,324
Rym: I hated it.

528
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:11,250
Rym: Everyone hated it.

529
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,113
Rym: You know why I ground?

530
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:18,537
Rym: because I was scared shitless that if I walked somewhere dangerous out in the woods and someone stronger than me Came by they might just kill me.

531
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:21,710
Rym: I'll lose like three levels and all my magic items and I'm fucked.

532
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:24,009
Rym: That's like 40 or 50 hours of my life gone.

533
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:29,929
Rym: And that dynamic made this interesting situation kind of by accident.

534
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:30,170
Rym: where?

535
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:36,198
Rym: Exploring these old MMOs was interesting and scary because they were dangerous and you had a lot to lose.

536
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:44,765
Rym: if you wandered into some scary like if you went into the killing fields and You were invisible and some level 80 like paladin dude saw you and he wanted to kill you.

537
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:46,210
Rym: You were basically done.

538
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:50,269
Rym: Yeah, it was scary to be out there and you actually had things to lose.

539
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:58,820
Scott: I mean, this is what I sort of like about, you know, the I mean the part of fallout 3 we discussed You know earlier in the show, which is good is the exploring part.

540
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:08,996
Scott: The problem is is that in Exploring fallout 3 it's sort of all pre done and a lot of it's just repetition of existing stuff And it's not very big.

541
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:10,422
Scott: like you can't explore it all.

542
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,105
Scott: and then what?

543
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:13,949
Rym: the first time I played fallout I had a guy was really good at sneaking right?

544
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:23,900
Rym: So well fallout 3. so I went out and I just walked north as far as I could go because I was curious and After inspecting like six or seven identical burned-out barns.

545
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:27,450
Rym: I stopped inspecting anything because there was nothing anywhere except plot.

546
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:35,270
Scott: but it's like, you know exploring just and you know a terrain is Can be fun, especially if the terrain is interesting and varied.

547
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:39,367
Scott: I mean Zelda 1. the reason it's so awesome is because they only gave you part of the map.

548
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:40,853
Scott: and if you didn't even if You didn't have a map.

549
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:41,957
Scott: It was all exploring.

550
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:45,570
Scott: you explored all these dungeons and yet a second quest you find you find that graveyard.

551
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,795
Rym: That is some scary shit.

552
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,423
Scott: Yeah, you get to the graveyard.

553
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:49,106
Scott: It's like whoa.

554
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,858
Rym: shit, you know You bump into a gravestone a ghost comes out.

555
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:53,265
Rym: You just run away exactly.

556
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:54,350
Rym: I'm never coming back here.

557
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:55,174
Scott: You know that.

558
00:33:55,214 --> 00:33:58,070
Scott: just exploring stuff and finding weird things.

559
00:33:58,132 --> 00:34:03,947
Scott: It's like, you know You find a secret and you go down there and it's actually weird and not like other places you've been.

560
00:34:03,987 --> 00:34:10,230
Scott: and this stuff down there It's like whoa, ah, you know, whereas you'd say look at D&D online, which we did a show about right?

561
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:16,348
Scott: You go and every single level looks exactly like every other level except it's you know, the same sarcophagus.

562
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:22,989
Rym: a hundred times It's like yeah, thanks, but think about this this was not necessarily intentional that it caused this.

563
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:26,599
Rym: I mean no one is going to argue that Griefing made these old games better.

564
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:31,150
Scott: No griefing made people not play those games And that's why the games that now have no griefing.

565
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:37,007
Rym: Well, what I'd argue is that a lot of people did play those games and some people like the griefing and some people didn't.

566
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:38,936
Rym: I Think that griefing did not.

567
00:34:39,337 --> 00:34:42,290
Rym: I think that the griefing that happened was just immersion behavior.

568
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:49,449
Rym: But as a result of that immersion behavior all these other secondary behaviors appeared around the griefing.

569
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:53,723
Rym: that Kind of accidentally caused things that certain people remember and like.

570
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,790
Rym: wow, I remember this feeling and it was awesome.

571
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:57,410
Rym: Why don't I get that from modern games?

572
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,775
Scott: Yeah, but the griefing didn't.

573
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:01,850
Rym: it caused it but not in a good way and not directly.

574
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:10,180
Scott: It's basically you had you know You have you add a certain feature to a game and the game and that feature has bad Consequences and good consequences.

575
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:22,065
Scott: the bad consequences are that big powerful players were playing for a long time will just kill noobs which means that the more powerful players will continue to get more powerful more easily and they basically have this huge momentum advantage.

576
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:28,149
Scott: and weak players can never become More powerful because they keep getting killed by people who are already powerful and it just creates this sort of.

577
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,903
Scott: you know Rich guys stay rich poor guys stay poor situation except they can't.

578
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:33,850
Rym: what it enforced was a weird community.

579
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:42,166
Rym: I'm not saying this is good, but this happened in the a lot of these old muds and MMOs where The high-level players would kind of form factions, you know, you know, they'd hate each other.

580
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:53,741
Rym: like I'm with this guy I'm with this guy their clans their tribes all that stuff and Then new players and young players kind of come under the wing of one of them and like I can't go into the scary bad Lands unless I have a paladin to take me

581
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:54,002
Scott: through.

582
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:59,910
Scott: side effect is that you know It created this, you know danger and that danger of being out in the world created.

583
00:36:00,272 --> 00:36:04,370
Scott: You know that same sort of excitement you get when you're in Zelda and you find the graveyard for the first time.

584
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:16,150
Scott: So, you know this horrible griefing mechanic had to cut, you know multiple consequences some of which were good for the game and some of which were bad for the game and You know It's like how can we somehow?

585
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,330
Scott: Get those good parts back into the game without also bringing these bad parts that scare players away back in?

586
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,369
Rym: Yeah, and it's not just the griefing in the danger.

587
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:25,738
Rym: Think about the the force socialization.

588
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,927
Rym: and let's compare an old MMO to a game like Wow.

589
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:35,636
Rym: in Wow If you you gang up with like a high-level player to power level you through, you know to grind up Usually don't they not?

590
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:36,199
Scott: let you do that.

591
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:41,369
Scott: They like yell at you if they catch you or I Don't think there's anything like I remember like in old muds.

592
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:46,490
Scott: What would happen is you could join a group of a very powerful player like you would actually in the game type group and the?

593
00:36:46,530 --> 00:37:00,810
Scott: Players name and they'd be level 100 and you'd be level like one and then they would kill a monster and you would get half The XP and then you'd be level 20 after like one monster, you know, you could do stuff like that But then it's someone caught you doing that they would just like, you know Ban you or delete your

594
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:02,257
Rym: And

595
00:37:02,298 --> 00:37:09,689
Scott: then like you what you could do is they said, okay you can only group with someone if they're within 10 levels of you and they put all these rules in and stuff and

596
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:17,035
Rym: But people group like that and and do their clan stuff just to grind up to be able to do like these raids and to Do other things.

597
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:19,932
Rym: so it's kind of this very functional meta Construct.

598
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:26,150
Rym: in old MMOs if you grouped up like that often the grouping up was hey, I'm a high-level guy.

599
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:33,368
Rym: You want me to let your cat like take your character with me so I can show you all the crazy stuff in the killing Fields that you can never see on your own.

600
00:37:33,992 --> 00:37:37,570
Rym: You want me to take you through the fucking ruins of blah and then after you get them out there?

601
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,764
Rym: You're like, alright, give me all your gold or I'm not taking you back.

602
00:37:39,985 --> 00:37:42,078
Rym: Yeah Or just alright.

603
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:42,401
Rym: See ya.

604
00:37:42,764 --> 00:37:44,812
Rym: Yeah, I Did that.

605
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:47,387
Rym: you know how often I would take so course.

606
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:47,990
Rym: this was a glitch.

607
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:51,130
Rym: I would find some bad guy don't enemy of my clan.

608
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:56,630
Rym: I was a wizard and I'd be like, hey, I'll power level you I'll take you out blah and I'd take him out somewhere.

609
00:37:57,033 --> 00:38:04,910
Rym: I use a teleport glitch to teleport them home But instead of taking them home I took him to the glitch city that there was no way out of and then I just teleport home and leave him there.

610
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:08,475
Scott: I think that one Solution to this right.

611
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:12,430
Scott: this particular specific thing is actually to fix the numbers.

612
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:21,959
Scott: Right, if you look at these MMOs, right the way they work with the numbers and the levels and the damage and the two hits Right, is that the numbers basically go up exponentially right?

613
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,869
Scott: No number of level one guys can beat up a level 20 guy.

614
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:37,690
Scott: Right, but if they fixed all the numbering it would still have that same, you know carrot and stick You know What's it called the inner box mechanic?

615
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,350
Scott: I want to jump in right now continuing to level up right and getting more and more powerful.

616
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:52,505
Scott: But I think there's guys could gang up and beat a high-level guy Which would mean that you could allow the griefing but people wouldn't do it because you go into town and start killing off level one guys.

617
00:38:53,451 --> 00:39:02,069
Scott: Five of them would just all stab you and then they'd be like sweet and maybe even a bunch of low-level guys would Intentionally get together and go around killing high-level guys in an angry mob.

618
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:04,580
Scott: I think the numbers would not be out of scale.

619
00:39:04,862 --> 00:39:13,918
Rym: the other component to this the reason Griefing mattered and happened and the reason there was the sense of danger wasn't just that you could die It was because in old MMOs.

620
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,201
Rym: when you died it mattered a lot like if I was level 70.

621
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:28,690
Rym: I had to kill like a Thousand of the baddest monster in the game to go up a level and if I died, I lost the equivalent of like 5,000 guys worth of experience.

622
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:34,129
Rym: I would go down like three levels and it would take me like 20 or 30 hours to get that back.

623
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:43,523
Rym: I would also randomly drop items that I was equipped with like my two-handed deluxe sword of power That was really fucking hard to get or the magic item.

624
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,707
Rym: I got in a special drop.

625
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:45,310
Rym: That's gone now.

626
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:48,901
Scott: Well, that's just you know, that's just the nature of a grinding game.

627
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:55,330
Scott: It's like well, you're you're not investing any skill You're investing time and if we D level you are basically taking time away from your life.

628
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:58,747
Scott: But that's that you've already given up because you're an MMO player games.

629
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:07,164
Rym: It was bad I'm not going to argue was a good thing But the fact that you had something Tangible to lose you when you died meant that you were scared of dying.

630
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:11,038
Rym: if you wipe in a while raid like People don't care if they die.

631
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:13,690
Rym: Oh, we lost the wow raid or oh you killed me.

632
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,429
Rym: I'm just gonna respawn and keep going to do whatever I was gonna do.

633
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:20,809
Rym: All you did was slow me down in the grinding that I'm trying to get to.

634
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:23,707
Rym: All you did is delay me momentarily.

635
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:25,575
Rym: now I'm bored in the meta.

636
00:40:26,016 --> 00:40:27,582
Rym: losing is boring.

637
00:40:27,602 --> 00:40:29,670
Rym: in the old games losing sucks.

638
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:32,246
Rym: The real answer is that losing should be interesting.

639
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:32,789
Scott: That's right.

640
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,355
Scott: See I actually you know.

641
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:39,050
Scott: the MMO that I've always wanted to make solves all these problems at least in my opinion, right?

642
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,303
Scott: The game I've always wanted which I've discussed many times right?

643
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:45,617
Scott: is some sort of action survival game right.

644
00:40:45,697 --> 00:40:48,849
Scott: where you know fighting is is FPS skill, you know.

645
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:52,459
Scott: And you pay money every time.

646
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:56,848
Scott: you let you spawn just like an arcade and as long as you don't die You don't have to pay ever again.

647
00:40:57,592 --> 00:41:01,084
Scott: And when you die, you're just dead and you have to pay money again.

648
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:02,990
Scott: You get a brand new character with nothing.

649
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:07,730
Scott: There's no levels experience or skills because all the skills are in you because they're your FPS skills.

650
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:13,770
Scott: But there is equipment and ammo and level and you know levels but weapons and armor and those sorts of things.

651
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:23,319
Scott: So if you die out in the middle of snow where because you were exploring the gigantic map You know and a giant robot came and crushed you Well, you were you have your.

652
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,630
Scott: you're basically a brand new character now with nothing.

653
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:34,386
Scott: Maybe you have a pistol from town or whatever and if you can get back out there Pick up all the stuff off your corpse and no one else is taking it yet and the robot doesn't crush you.

654
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:41,208
Rym: and good for You know, well think about the like the weird economics of Greece griefing like how come Wow and all these games?

655
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:41,890
Rym: don't have your house.

656
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,199
Rym: You don't remember all the old mo's?

657
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:43,542
Rym: you'd like.

658
00:41:43,562 --> 00:41:44,710
Rym: build your house build your fort.

659
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:46,876
Rym: I guess Eve online has that to a degree.

660
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:56,450
Scott: actually if online is you have a ship right implemented in spreadsheets, but yeah Yeah, well, I think the reason that Wow doesn't do that is because they want to control the game world.

661
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:04,028
Scott: They don't want you to control the game world and the maps and all that stuff and it adds a lot of complexity And it's not gonna get them much more money.

662
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:12,959
Rym: Yeah Well this this this is the crux of everything because what I realized and I realized this and then later like just now I was Going through the slashed out article and I pull it up.

663
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:20,045
Rym: Someone else said the exact same thing The reason for all of this is that South Park episode on World of Warcraft.

664
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:21,830
Rym: because look at what happened in that episode, right?

665
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:27,150
Rym: You've got one character who becomes a badass and starts griefing in game in a way that matters.

666
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:33,230
Rym: He's killing characters in a way that matters in the context of the game not in some meta.

667
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:35,550
Rym: You've slowed me down in the single-player game.

668
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:41,369
Rym: I'm playing with all my friends in the co-op game that I'm playing independent of all these other million people playing.

669
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:43,495
Rym: Wow You've been convenience me you asshole.

670
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:49,210
Rym: It's you fucking killed my character and most people do not want that out of a game.

671
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,439
Rym: They do not want direct Griefable competition among players.

672
00:42:53,941 --> 00:43:05,109
Rym: if in Wow when you found like you're you know You're the Alliance and you find some whore guy just wandering around out in the wilderness and you fucking kill him and take all this shit People would hate that because they lose a big game.

673
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,330
Scott: Yeah be a game only for super nerds.

674
00:43:07,812 --> 00:43:11,430
Scott: Right and very few people would play just like very few people played.

675
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,610
Scott: You know Diablo on hardcore mode where if you die, you have to start over from the beginning.

676
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,542
Rym: Yep, a single-player games like dungeon crew, whatever.

677
00:43:17,582 --> 00:43:20,172
Rym: I forget when that hack but there was some game I own.

678
00:43:20,212 --> 00:43:23,990
Rym: it was basically a net hat clone in 3d way back and had an option hard car mode.

679
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:32,478
Rym: That said it would literally physically delete your save file and it had all these protections for if you tried to like turn the game Off it would just delete your save file.

680
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:42,390
Rym: Anyway, yep, and it basically made sure if you die Your character is dead and there's nothing in the world You could possibly have done short of like writing the contents of your RAM to a disk periodically.

681
00:43:42,672 --> 00:43:45,250
Scott: Dwarf Fortress does the same kind of thing.

682
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:54,020
Scott: It's like you save but you can't like have multiple saves and load up an older one unless you start hacking around, you know By default, it's just you save and you can have.

683
00:43:54,281 --> 00:44:00,470
Scott: you can save multiple different dwarf fortresses But that one fortress has one save and when it's dead, it's dead.

684
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:01,889
Scott: You can't like go roll it back.

685
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:07,048
Rym: But the reason Wow took off is that what most people want is a single-player game.

686
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:15,495
Rym: effectively It's a single-player narrative where you play through this entire narrative and you don't care that everyone else played through effectively the same narrative.

687
00:44:15,515 --> 00:44:38,450
Rym: you played through the narrative and that's all you care about and then you effectively play this kind of co-op game where The only people you interact with are all your friends who are also playing through this narrative and then you play these raids together and do This stuff together, but they don't actually want a real economy of revenge and fighting and inter-character conflict except in these like instantiated and not just instances in MMOs.

688
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,420
Rym: But I'm talking because people paid money.

689
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:49,807
Scott: and if it's a game of investing, you know if it's a game of skill Right like counter-strike people have no problem dying in counter-strike because a you're gonna come back to life pretty soon, right.

690
00:44:50,348 --> 00:44:54,245
Scott: and B What do you lose when you die in counter-strike besides the round?

691
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:58,970
Scott: but people want this Game where it's about investing time and not investing skill.

692
00:44:59,471 --> 00:45:04,447
Scott: Right, if you lose you just lost time in your life and you've been made to see.

693
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:09,130
Scott: you know The the how stupid you were for wasting all your time and money on this game.

694
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,218
Scott: You've been confronted with your own stupidity.

695
00:45:11,238 --> 00:45:14,430
Scott: They you know, people don't mind doing stupid things or being stupid.

696
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,450
Scott: They only mind when you point it out to them then they get indignant and angry.

697
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:19,617
Scott: So you can't point it out to them.

698
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:21,041
Rym: See I'm thinking more.

699
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:23,870
Scott: you can't make them realize their own, you know failures.

700
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:25,729
Rym: It's not just you're only here, you know.

701
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:28,850
Scott: If someone's you know has a fault and you point it out.

702
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:33,950
Scott: You're a jerk even if the fault is true because you're not supposed to point out people's faults because it makes them feel bad.

703
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:34,693
Rym: I'll be honest though.

704
00:45:34,714 --> 00:45:39,001
Rym: I don't think that's terribly relevant to what's going on here at least not directly Well, but I mean that's what.

705
00:45:39,082 --> 00:45:39,770
Scott: that's what you know.

706
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:45,070
Scott: If you die in an MMO and they actually penalized you with levels it makes people feel bad for that same reason.

707
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:50,010
Rym: Well, it makes them feel bad directly just because they don't necessarily feel stupid for having invested the time.

708
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:54,495
Rym: They feel mad because they lost something tangible But it's not something.

709
00:45:54,716 --> 00:45:57,449
Scott: they'd already lost it though, but they just made to realize that.

710
00:45:57,469 --> 00:46:00,426
Rym: they know You see in your mind, but they feel like they got something.

711
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,050
Rym: they played the game.

712
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,263
Rym: They got you know their trinkets.

713
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:02,950
Rym: They got their stuff.

714
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:06,986
Rym: They have this tangible thing that they got and they invested time to get it.

715
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:12,010
Rym: if you take it away They've lost it and the time and they have to spend more time to get it back.

716
00:46:13,731 --> 00:46:14,938
Rym: You're just expanding that into your.

717
00:46:14,998 --> 00:46:20,382
Scott: I hate MMOs argument, which is a separate argument But I mean the thing is they didn't actually get anything tangible.

718
00:46:20,683 --> 00:46:22,048
Rym: See that's again to them.

719
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:26,470
Rym: It's tangible That they couldn't have gotten some other way short of like spending money and buying it on eBay.

720
00:46:27,213 --> 00:46:35,170
Rym: but what I'm saying is that what people want out of a game like Wow is this instantiated danger where they only want danger when they're ready for danger.

721
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,462
Rym: They want an instance of danger where the danger is contained to that instance.

722
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:41,039
Rym: time to do a raid time to do this thing There's.

723
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,114
Rym: you know We're all gonna get together and do something in Wow If I die here.

724
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:48,529
Rym: the consequences of that don't extend beyond what I am doing here right now.

725
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:52,702
Rym: But in old MMOs, there was no instantiation like that.

726
00:46:52,963 --> 00:46:58,590
Rym: if you died somewhere the consequences were the same No matter where you were and they were like part of the overall experience.

727
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:09,190
Rym: People don't want houses partly because if some people had houses Unless there were a mechanism for like robbing those houses griefing those houses the players who want that stuff wouldn't care about them.

728
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:13,570
Rym: People want this instantiated parallel experience and Wow is just parallel play.

729
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:16,723
Scott: Well, the thing with the houses right is that you know, what is a house?

730
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:18,450
Scott: get you in game, right?

731
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,699
Rym: Well, it gets you nothing except dollhouse.

732
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:27,619
Rym: Basically unless you make some sort of clan thing where I defend my house We have this group house where we store all our stuff.

733
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,130
Rym: if you attack us and take our stuff now We don't have stuff but that again introduces the griefing Ella, right?

734
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:42,718
Scott: So what they have in Wow is they have things like, you know, the mounts and stuff Which is you know, which is better than a house because when you walk around People can see your mount.

735
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:45,290
Scott: when you're going, you know, when you're out and about people don't see your house.

736
00:47:45,656 --> 00:47:48,474
Scott: Where your house Currency with the house.

737
00:47:48,635 --> 00:47:48,735
Scott: the

738
00:47:48,775 --> 00:48:00,410
Rym: special sword that I got in some drop on Easter from an easter egg that I found after I killed a fairy and ripped it out of her still beating chest and Then I used a glitch to put it in my wall in my house and it was all cool-looking.

739
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:07,909
Rym: I had to like invite people to my house bring him in and be like check that out and then watch them to make sure They didn't like steal something from my house while they were in there.

740
00:48:08,091 --> 00:48:24,808
Scott: Yeah, and if Wow just you know made houses as places, you know They gave people a space in the game that they could just decorate like dollhouse and that was it and didn't do any of the Griefing stuff because they would never do that because it would lose the money and make people upset then Basically people would get houses, you know, just cuz they had nothing better to do.

741
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:29,728
Scott: But if the houses didn't do anything, you know, it'd be like, okay.

742
00:48:29,768 --> 00:48:30,330
Scott: I've got a house.

743
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,830
Scott: No one ever looks at it and it's taking up space in the game and no one ever goes here.

744
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,894
Scott: What's the point now?

745
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:41,380
Rym: think about what people consider griefing and Wow - they kind of they've decontextualized Griefing the only.

746
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:47,505
Rym: you can only grief Via the microphone by a chatting and by slowing people down in their grinds and things like that.

747
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:51,343
Rym: in old MMOs griefing was Directly contextual in the game.

748
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:52,389
Rym: I fucking killed that guy.

749
00:48:53,072 --> 00:48:58,489
Rym: I stood I went to your house stood outside the door and killed you every time you tried to leave until you cried.

750
00:48:58,509 --> 00:49:10,698
Rym: and while that wasn't good contextualized griefing is Effectively just competition and hardcore players or people who call themselves hardcore in the old sense They effectively want that.

751
00:49:10,738 --> 00:49:13,690
Rym: they want brutal competition between players directly.

752
00:49:14,032 --> 00:49:21,429
Rym: That is contextual within the game and games like wow We're so successful because they remove all ways to grief in the context of the game.

753
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:29,730
Rym: It's only griefing that's left is like emailing people pictures of penises or saying penis to someone while they're while they like kill you once And laugh at you after you died.

754
00:49:30,455 --> 00:49:51,350
Rym: They've removed all the griefing elements And I think those griefing elements are kind of integral to what these people like the guy in this article want from old MMOs and want from new MMOs, but World of Warcraft Blizzard just realized that there's much more money in catering to Single-player shared experiences that are parallel as opposed to truly massive multiplayer experiences.

755
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:52,033
Scott: Well, it's done.

756
00:49:52,053 --> 00:49:55,770
Scott: We've you know, this is just applies to gaming in general is something we've always you know.

757
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:59,050
Scott: No, and I guess we I don't know if we've talked about it that much on the show.

758
00:49:59,130 --> 00:49:59,854
Scott: Is that this?

759
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:10,523
Scott: you know, there's some gamers who actually want legit Competition some sort of test of skill win and lose and there are other people who just want to play around and they don't you know.

760
00:50:10,564 --> 00:50:18,114
Scott: and if you try if they if you play with Those people and you're actually trying to win they'll and you're like you're competing seriously They'll just become upset.

761
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:38,408
Scott: they you know, and those people are the kind of people who really love games like, you know Apples to apples or the game of life, you know They just they just want to just sort of go and do stuff and they don't actually, you know winning it They're not trying to win They don't think about trying to win and they don't you know, they're not playing for serious They're just playing, you know, because it's a fun mind occupying thing.

762
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:48,109
Scott: There's just something to do to occupy your brain is doing fun stuff putting little people in a car you know saying funny things rolling some dice because rolling dice is fun.

763
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:54,428
Scott: and You know these kind of gamers can't really play the same kind of games and get along.

764
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,930
Scott: but you know I mean I can enjoy an apples apples and such, you know.

765
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,750
Scott: But I don't play it to win because it's not a play to win game.

766
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:02,556
Rym: I do because it is.

767
00:51:02,717 --> 00:51:04,973
Rym: it is definitely a game to play to win you Don't?

768
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:09,752
Rym: all you want to do is try to figure out the site guys to the group and figure out how to get the other Person.

769
00:51:09,772 --> 00:51:10,718
Rym: and yeah, but it comes on.

770
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:13,192
Scott: you play you already, you know, it's what card you have You can't?

771
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:14,621
Scott: you know, if you don't have the card what see?

772
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:16,050
Rym: but that's why you mod the game.

773
00:51:16,331 --> 00:51:20,704
Rym: You have some rule where every round you can discard like two of your two cars.

774
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:23,655
Scott: and I'm not talking about a mod of the game I'm talking about the game itself.

775
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:26,084
Scott: Yeah, and then the game itself is not a game.

776
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,570
Scott: That's really a winning and losing game.

777
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,855
Scott: It's just sort of a have fun.

778
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:31,285
Rym: Yeah game mostly just this and this.

779
00:51:31,606 --> 00:51:41,121
Scott: but I notice that you know There's people who just they don't like playing competitive games period and there are people who they really just want Competition and they get upset when there isn't any.

780
00:51:41,763 --> 00:51:46,077
Scott: and then you know, I can play both but I recognize the difference between each.

781
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:50,991
Scott: and if I'm playing a competitive game and someone else is not playing it competitively that is a Problem.

782
00:51:51,032 --> 00:51:54,166
Scott: and if I am playing a non-competitive game and someone else is playing it competitively.

783
00:51:54,206 --> 00:51:55,130
Scott: That's also a problem.

784
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:58,853
Rym: Well, the article just made me really realize Why.

785
00:51:58,873 --> 00:52:03,190
Rym: you know I always talk about how the realm the first MMO is fundamentally no different from Wow.

786
00:52:03,672 --> 00:52:19,610
Rym: And that's true primarily because all the same things are in both games Except that the old game the realm Had all these griefing elements that were kind of there and I had to do the grindy stuff to be able to compete in the Griefing which is what I really cared about.

787
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:29,946
Rym: I didn't realize until now that what I all I cared about in that game was the player Interactions and the griefing and I ground because I wanted to be powerful enough to enact my will in the game.

788
00:52:29,987 --> 00:52:33,216
Rym: that actually mattered to me And everyone playing this old game.

789
00:52:33,236 --> 00:52:35,363
Rym: you owe and the realm wanted that.

790
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:41,829
Scott: but 90% of people play Aren't powerful enough to play the griefing and just immediately quit because they just get killed by you.

791
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:53,410
Scott: That's why I need a few people crazy enough to actually Level up and deal with getting killed constantly by big powerful players who got there first Are the only people we're gonna play and that's why the game is gone and Wow has a billion players.

792
00:52:53,581 --> 00:52:57,154
Rym: Yep I mean look at the questions at the end of this quote unquote article I was talking about.

793
00:52:57,818 --> 00:53:03,869
Rym: if you think the very things that have been removed Housing and thieving will be two good examples caused Wow to become the most popular MMO.

794
00:53:04,231 --> 00:53:04,833
Rym: Why is that?

795
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:11,156
Rym: do Ultima online rules not translate well to true 3d environment our people To do with 3d.

796
00:53:11,196 --> 00:53:16,190
Rym: Yeah, he's done Wow retarded, but are people incapable of planning for corpse looting?

797
00:53:17,616 --> 00:53:23,030
Rym: our players inept Such that developers don't want to leave them in control of risk analysis?

798
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:37,251
Scott: He is thinking this unlike a way too detailed level You know, he is is basically people don't want to compete period they just want to play with you saying Why do people like Final Fantasy 7 more than they like Final Fantasy 1?

799
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:41,746
Rym: Is it because the hit points only went up to 999 and Final Fantasy 1?

800
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:43,130
Scott: this guy's just doesn't get it.

801
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,115
Scott: He's too into it.

802
00:53:44,155 --> 00:53:44,940
Scott: So he doesn't under.

803
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,106
Scott: you know, that's the problem.

804
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:46,830
Rym: He almost gets it though.

805
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:55,187
Rym: He almost gets it because he talks a lot about like the housing stuff and the thieving and the griefing But then he doesn't extend it and realize that all he cares about is the griefing.

806
00:53:55,207 --> 00:53:55,769
Rym: Well, this is something.

807
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:56,673
Scott: This is the problem.

808
00:53:56,713 --> 00:54:03,329
Scott: people have you always see this with the guy who's playing D&D and he knows something's wrong with D&D And he says how can I fix it?

809
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:12,870
Scott: But he's his mind is so deep into D&D that he's like, okay What if we changed the amount of damage on the longsword, you know, what have we changed this spell?

810
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,423
Scott: It's like no no, no, you got to bring your brain back out.

811
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:18,270
Scott: Look at it from the zoomed out perspective.

812
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:19,858
Scott: Look at the more fundamental things.

813
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:28,390
Scott: It is not the details of Corpse looting strategies right that are making the game, you know a problem for some people.

814
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:32,307
Scott: It is the fundamental that people don't want to lose.

815
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:36,540
Scott: You know, you can't lose in Farmville.

816
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:38,607
Rym: I was about to say look at the example of Farmville.

817
00:54:38,647 --> 00:54:39,390
Rym: Farmville is the game.

818
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:43,070
Rym: It's what it's arguably one of the more popular games in the history of gaming at this point.

819
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:44,941
Scott: Yeah, I think you know, the Sims is pretty close.

820
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:45,504
Scott: What's the Sims?

821
00:54:45,786 --> 00:54:46,309
Scott: a dollhouse?

822
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,502
Scott: Well, even we thought we just saw Will Wright the other day.

823
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:51,090
Scott: He said the Sims of the dollhouse.

824
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,464
Rym: In fact, we had to not call it a dollhouse because guys wouldn't play it.

825
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:55,910
Rym: So we had to change the names and everything.

826
00:54:56,051 --> 00:54:58,393
Scott: Yep, but the Sims of the dollhouse That's all it is.

827
00:54:58,413 --> 00:55:05,090
Scott: and it was the crazy popular because it's not something you can win and lose or compete at It's just you just play around with stuff.

828
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,458
Rym: But you can compete a little bit.

829
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,258
Rym: you can show off what you've done You show off your farm you trade with people.

830
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:16,626
Rym: they people want all the benefits of winning But they don't want any serious complications from using.

831
00:55:16,706 --> 00:55:23,350
Rym: they want losing Not to change their course and not to stop their course and not to destroy anything they have.

832
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:30,385
Rym: But they want it only to delay them in their eventual winning Like they want like kind of like a Mario where I fall in the hole.

833
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:32,989
Rym: All right, I'm delayed But I will eventually win no matter what.

834
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,055
Scott: Yeah I mean even our losing should be fun.

835
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:39,992
Scott: that really only also works for people who actually care about gaming most people Right.

836
00:55:40,012 --> 00:55:42,099
Scott: The idea is that you're a game developer.

837
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,650
Scott: if your goal is to make a good game quality game then do all the stuff.

838
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:50,973
Scott: We say well, yeah skill challenges, you know coming that's fun I'm gonna.

839
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:53,370
Rym: I'm gonna for once take the less ego filled route.

840
00:55:53,752 --> 00:55:57,290
Rym: Do what we say or in the very least what people like Will Wright say?

841
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:09,657
Scott: If you want to make a game that makes a shit ton of money and has lots of people playing and playing a lot Then all you have to do is basically make the game such that no matter what players do you give them a reward That'll make them happy, right?

842
00:56:09,698 --> 00:56:10,602
Scott: So it's like they.

843
00:56:10,642 --> 00:56:12,230
Scott: they're sitting in a box with a whole bunch of buttons.

844
00:56:12,471 --> 00:56:13,877
Scott: They push buttons food comes out.

845
00:56:13,897 --> 00:56:15,504
Scott: They push a different button food comes out.

846
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:16,950
Scott: Of course everyone food comes out.

847
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:17,954
Scott: Look at the genius.

848
00:56:18,035 --> 00:56:18,637
Rym: Look at the difference.

849
00:56:18,677 --> 00:56:20,465
Scott: It is having so much fun playing your game.

850
00:56:20,505 --> 00:56:26,018
Rym: food keeps coming out Between the sims versus Farmville.

851
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:32,988
Rym: a game like Farmville the food comes out no matter what but in a game like the sims Sometimes good food comes out as in.

852
00:56:33,048 --> 00:56:41,790
Rym: you know My character succeeded or I made a cool thing and sometimes bad food comes out Like I set my character and all their friends and family on fire and watch them die.

853
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,022
Rym: And you know what players like but they do it.

854
00:56:44,103 --> 00:56:45,450
Scott: That's why Sim City, right?

855
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:48,549
Scott: You can have Godzilla crush your whole city, but you do it on purpose and it's fun.

856
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:59,710
Rym: but that's why you can have a game that rewards players no matter what they do and it's still a great game because if they Succeed you reward them with good endings and if they fail you reward them with bad endings.

857
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:02,730
Rym: But both good and bad endings are interesting and worth exploring.

858
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,292
Rym: It's it's.

859
00:57:03,392 --> 00:57:07,126
Scott: it's just that even you say bad ending but the bad ending is a reward.

860
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:09,254
Scott: getting to see Godzilla crush Your city is fun.

861
00:57:09,595 --> 00:57:11,021
Scott: You're seeing Godzilla going to.

862
00:57:11,121 --> 00:57:12,246
Scott: it's like oh, it's so fun.

863
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:13,370
Scott: It's like a role-playing game.

864
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,998
Scott: I mean no matter what you do is fun.

865
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:19,021
Rym: Yes where you know, if you succeed and get the McGuffin It's awesome and everyone had a good time.

866
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:20,510
Rym: if you fail in the world ends.

867
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,039
Rym: It's awesome because you told a great story and everyone died.

868
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:25,589
Scott: getting getting killed in an MMO and losing three levels isn't fun.

869
00:57:26,931 --> 00:57:33,702
Rym: so people want to get all the benefits of getting all the levels and get a Reward that they perceive as valuable for the time they spend.

870
00:57:33,964 --> 00:57:35,390
Rym: so they have this sense of accomplishment.

871
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:40,450
Rym: But they don't actually want to lose anything or every risk of losing anything tangible.

872
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:44,490
Scott: You people just you know, if you want to make a game like it's very it's ton of sales.

873
00:57:44,993 --> 00:57:46,280
Scott: It should be fun all the time.

874
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,010
Scott: the amount of fun at different ports.

875
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:50,929
Scott: You know this part can be less fun that other part which is super fun.

876
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:53,119
Scott: But there needs to be fun all the time.

877
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:57,247
Scott: if there is any part that is not fun or anti fun People are gonna quit your game.

878
00:57:58,132 --> 00:58:00,870
Scott: You know if they lose three levels, they'll just quit right then and there and cancel.

879
00:58:01,131 --> 00:58:05,110
Rym: So I feel like the answer for this guy is to get good at FPS and just like counter-strike.

880
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,363
Scott: That's why I'm playing Street Fighter and be a team flasher.

881

Scott: Yeah Team flashing.
