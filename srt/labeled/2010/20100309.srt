1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,097
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, March 9th.

2
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:11,699
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:14,227
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:15,270
Rym: paranoia.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,043
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:29,755
Rym: I feel like we should have said something.

7
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,780
Scott: no, I feel like we should have said something.

8
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:33,887
Rym: Are you impinging upon me?

9
00:00:33,927 --> 00:00:35,593
Rym: Are you are you a communist?

10
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:37,259
Rym: No, I got nothing.

11
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:47,339
Rym: Yeah, I feel I always feel really awkward quoting like paranoia in any way Like if I ever ask anyone are you a happy communist on one hand or just be like why?

12
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,774
Rym: well No, even if they know paranoia on one hand.

13
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:51,223
Rym: It's social currency It's the whole.

14
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:53,917
Rym: I am saying something from a media.

15
00:00:53,977 --> 00:00:57,799
Rym: that is cool Hoping that you will respond in kind thus proving that we can be friends.

16
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:01,634
Rym: But at the same time if someone says to you the cake is a lie.

17
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:02,196
Rym: What do you do?

18
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:03,000
Scott: smack them up?

19
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,316
Rym: So that's why I can't ever ask anyone if they're a happy communist.

20
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:07,819
Scott: That's right.

21
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:13,336
Rym: But at the same time I I know everyone's played portal, I don't know everyone's played paranoia.

22
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,680
Scott: almost no one's played paranoia.

23
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:16,549
Scott: Yeah, most it's weird.

24
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:17,011
Scott: It's like this.

25
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,261
Scott: it's one of those things That's like.

26
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:24,520
Scott: it's popular enough that people know it, but it's not so popular like portal that everyone knows.

27
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,234
Scott: I think a lot you can use it as an awesome detector.

28
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:31,777
Scott: You can just be like Hey, it You know.

29
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:35,240
Scott: Yeah, have you troubleshooted anything down in sector 3 lately?

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,894
Scott: Right and if they respond appropriately then it's like aha I know this is a smart cool person, but it's the same thing.

31
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:44,737
Rym: the cake is a lie.

32
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:45,440
Rym: people are doing.

33
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:49,379
Scott: Okay, well, let's save it for the actual main big business the main topic.

34
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:56,280
Rym: All right, so I guess we have to talk about this because everyone else is gonna talk about it.

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,553
Rym: And it's it's hilarious in manifold ways.

36
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:05,070
Rym: so in case you weren't paying attention Ubisoft Decided to go all the way with DRM.

37
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,780
Rym: They were like you know what we're going to just have the DRM.

38
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:10,859
Rym: That is exactly as evil as everyone ever said DRM could be.

39
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:13,171
Rym: You've got to have your internet connection all the time.

40
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:17,232
Rym: if it drops for a second your game Just crashes and done well again doesn't crash.

41
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:20,289
Scott: basically just doesn't let you play The internet.

42
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:27,187
Scott: it will check every time you run the game You know with the DRM servers and constantly while you're playing the game And it stops your game.

43
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:34,074
Rym: it interrupts the game if you lose the internet mm-hmm Or if you know anything goes wrong anywhere between your computer and their DRM servers.

44
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:39,013
Scott: obviously people who don't have internet connections Can't play people with like you know even if they want to play.

45
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:40,640
Scott: single-player isn't just multiplayer.

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,524
Scott: This is a single player.

47
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:43,331
Scott: even if they have like a dial-up modem.

48
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:45,580
Scott: They probably are not gonna be able to play.

49
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:49,900
Rym: Yeah, what about poor people like me who tend to put steam in offline mode and plan laptops up?

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,760
Scott: Yeah, can't plan an airplane unless the airplane is one of those cool airplanes with Wi-Fi can't play if the Wi-Fi is congested.

51
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:58,659
Scott: So basically why would you buy this game?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,939
Scott: You know for you know the PC.

53
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:02,184
Scott: You wouldn't.

54
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:03,528
Scott: you'd be a moron if you did.

55
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:15,640
Rym: and the thing is I mean a lot of people have made the I guess The best counter-argument you can make that every gamer who's serious about gaming one They're not gonna play this game on a laptop and to everyone just has broadband.

56
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,216
Rym: It's no big deal except for you know the military people overseas who are some of the biggest gamers.

57
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:25,229
Scott: There are yeah You know they don't always have a reliable internet connection.

58
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:28,340
Scott: most lot of people do not always have reliable internet connection.

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,305
Scott: We are not in the ghost in the shell world.

60
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:38,600
Scott: you cannot write code that just assumes that there is a perfect and awesome You know connection to the internet at all times.

61
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:45,905
Rym: I can't even write code that assumes that another demon on my server will get messages I sent to it exactly you know.

62
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:47,088
Scott: so you know.

63
00:03:47,148 --> 00:04:02,680
Scott: until that day comes when networks are like incredibly reliable and super fast and awesome probably after we're dead then You can write this code and have this DRM But until then no and even in that such a world that DRM probably still would not work.

64
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:07,320
Rym: So what's interesting though is that they were there was a lot of talk, and there's even a slash shot article.

65
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,658
Rym: I think it said the DRM scheme that will work and people were talking about how.

66
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:20,992
Rym: yes It's going to eventually be cracked But it'll take a long time for it to be cracked and in the meantime The people who care about the game are gonna be forced to buy it.

67
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:23,926
Rym: the company will make its money and DRM will serve its purpose.

68
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:24,972
Rym: It's the nuclear option.

69
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:25,756
Rym: It's the final.

70
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:26,560
Rym: This is it.

71
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,128
Rym: It's happening and everything will be fine at.

72
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,179
Rym: it was cracked right away.

73
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:42,103
Scott: It was cracked like the next day as predicted right, and I know they denied that it was cracked though They said it wasn't and that the people who think they cracked it will get a nasty surprise Or something.

74
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:44,049
Scott: and then in addition to that.

75
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,119
Scott: right there DRM server went down if people couldn't play the game.

76
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:49,085
Rym: well Let's get back to that.

77
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,740
Rym: so one they said you know that something ominously bad will happen.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,543
Rym: Maybe they'll do what?

79
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:55,852
Rym: was that one game where it just kept you on the boat.

80
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:59,936
Scott: Oh, yeah, there was a Okay, so here's two stories right.

81
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,819
Scott: number one There's a Dragon Quest game.

82
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:15,040
Scott: And if you got a cracked version for the DS because DS piracy is huge with the r4 cartridges Then basically you couldn't get past the first screen like it would work But the first screen in the game you wouldn't be able to get past the boat you just be on this boat forever.

83
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:20,412
Scott: It would say talk to all the people on the boat to continue and even if you talk to all the people on the boat Twice you wouldn't be able to continue.

84
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:21,681
Rym: I forget what game It was.

85
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:30,080
Rym: there was a PC game that did something similar where if the CD was copied And it didn't like catch this extra data on it the game would play perfectly normally.

86
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Rym: But it would ramp up the difficulty bit by bit and eventually about halfway through the game make it impossible Yep, and then corrupt your save file.

87
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,027
Scott: So the other there's another story.

88
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:47,475
Scott: I could I could find the link if I can remember and basically some guy who worked on Like a Spyro PlayStation game or something like that I forget what it was.

89
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:48,360
Rym: I remember those games.

90
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:53,556
Scott: He they they apparently made this crazy DRM that they were so proud of.

91
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:58,160
Scott: and this DRM You know what it did was basically the game would appear to be cracked.

92
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:00,469
Scott: but and so the crackers?

93
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:02,959
Scott: they cracked it and they put it out there and they just said oh it works.

94
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:10,120
Scott: and Then people who actually played the cracked version like the dialogue would be like you are playing a pirated version of the game.

95
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,007
Scott: I'm not gonna let you continue blah blah blah or.

96
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:17,224
Scott: some people also do clever things like you'll get a never-ending level with infinite bad Guys, I think it's an iPhone game.

97
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:18,407
Scott: if you pirate it does that.

98
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,980
Scott: and the thing is you know these are you know from their?

99
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,424
Scott: You know perspective.

100
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:29,863
Scott: these are some pretty clever DRMs because you think about it people doing the cracks Right.

101
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,752
Scott: those people are not interested in actually in playing the games.

102
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:34,940
Scott: most of the time cracking is their game.

103
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:40,286
Scott: You know it's like they want you to make a difficult crack for them So they can figure out how to break it.

104
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:45,686
Scott: so the more difficult your crack the more you're basically spending development time Creating this free game.

105
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:53,180
Scott: the free game is called break my DRM and the only people playing are these crackers And they're not actually gonna play Spyro or Assassin's Creed or your iPhone game.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,355
Scott: They don't give a shit, and then there's other people they're playing the game of.

107
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,440
Scott: I have no money.

108
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,140
Scott: I want to play all these games.

109
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,267
Scott: I will get them for free from these crackers.

110
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:10,054
Scott: all right and those people the ones who get upset when the crack doesn't Actually work the one thing that I'm really want someone to see.

111
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:26,987
Scott: if anyone has freaking balls, right Show me the sales figures of DRM versus non DRM because I am entirely convinced right that Having this DRM no matter how good or bad it is and how strong or weak it is Doesn't help your sales at all.

112
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:30,500
Scott: if I live let's say this DRM that I said you know they had.

113
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:38,255
Rym: Well, you're getting back into the old argument of the vast majority of people who pirate things Only pirate because they place zero value on this entertainment.

114
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:39,058
Scott: exactly they have.

115
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:41,707
Rym: they have taught They're willing to spend their time to play the game.

116
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,640
Rym: They're not willing to spend any other resource on most games.

117
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,745
Scott: Yep, or the second if they could not pirate the game They would not play the game.

118
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:54,100
Rym: the secondary list of people are people like me who actually do pirate.

119
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,346
Rym: I don't bother pirating games.

120
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:55,769
Rym: I have money.

121
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,800
Rym: time is more valuable to me than money.

122
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:02,680
Rym: So I won't bother with these cracks or anything, but I don't buy games when they come out anywhere.

123
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,848
Rym: I've been burned too many times by a get like a new Zelda game Just not being as good as it should have been.

124
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,095
Rym: or you know what about Bioshock?

125
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,640
Rym: Bioshock wasn't worth buying when I bought it.

126
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,789
Rym: I should have bought it last week for five bucks.

127
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,114
Scott: It's really five bucks now.

128
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:16,279
Rym: I don't know how much it is.

129
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:18,603
Rym: man All the.

130
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:27,140
Rym: any game that isn't a multiplayer game or some sort of Important game like portal where you have to play it or you give me that jackass saying the cake is a lie here later.

131
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:28,148
Scott: Yeah, you.

132
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:34,061
Scott: or a multiplayer game You know like NS2 you got to play it when it comes out because that's when the the you got to strike while the iron Is hot.

133
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:36,732
Rym: well that is the separate problem of we learned.

134
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:45,420
Rym: we learned very well from tribes too Because had we not bought tribes to immediately when it came out We would have had fewer hours of total tribes to playing in our lives.

135
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,709
Rym: Yeah And I don't know if I could have stomach that later.

136
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:53,419
Rym: now imagine if we'd gotten tribes to Like at the end of that whole era played it for like a week, and then it was dead.

137
00:08:53,904 --> 00:09:02,530
Rym: Yeah, that'd be like finding You know you're some like peasant in the medieval times, and you find these ancient Roman ruins and all you can see is how awesome They were.

138
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,189
Scott: Right you know, but I want to see.

139
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,774
Scott: see nobody has ever done this.

140
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,802
Scott: publish me your sales figures Right.

141
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:17,716
Scott: put out that you know a game without DRM, and then put out a game with DRM.

142
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:18,238
Scott: That's similar games.

143
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,024
Rym: Similar games are.

144
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,649
Rym: sorry I release an example.

145
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,160
Scott: right Assassin's Creed 1 for the PC Assassin's Creed 2 for the PC.

146
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:32,260
Scott: They could you know they could have done one with no DRM and one with DRM And you would assume they would have similar sales figures.

147
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:36,936
Scott: You know give me give me portal 1 versus portal 2 1 DRM 1 no DRM.

148
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:39,740
Scott: I have a. show me the difference in sales.

149
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,613
Rym: It's hard though because the I mean portal 1 and sales versus portal 2.

150
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:45,680
Rym: I mean I think it's gonna be completely different sales.

151
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:52,161
Rym: I align Portal 2 is gonna have pretty much immediate everyone buying it right away because of the success of portal 1.

152
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:57,169
Rym: Portal 1 had a spike in the beginning in the long tail of people Finding out the cake is a lie and then caring about it.

153
00:09:57,249 --> 00:10:01,920
Scott: the point is until someone shows some evidence of the contrary I will remain entirely unconvinced.

154
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,241
Scott: I do not.

155
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:10,050
Scott: I think you know putting DRM is a complete waste of time because even if it works Even if the crackers can't crack it it doesn't help your sales.

156
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,763
Scott: well the people who are pirating would never have bought it in any Situation.

157
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:17,580
Rym: there are many myriad arguments against DRM, and you've made one of them.

158
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,220
Rym: I think the root issue is still that the vast majority of people now have no money not money.

159
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:26,251
Scott: The people pirating are punk kids with no money.

160
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:27,537
Rym: That's not that if they had money.

161
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:28,340
Rym: They wouldn't buy the game.

162
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,042
Rym: They wouldn't care.

163
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,548
Rym: they only play the game because they don't care.

164
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,451
Rym: they it's there.

165
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:32,133
Rym: I'm bored.

166
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:33,799
Rym: Let's see what's on YouTube.

167
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,165
Rym: all right I've seen too many people get in the nuts.

168
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:36,349
Rym: Let's go to crunchyroll.

169
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,417
Rym: I'll watch all these shows because they're free yep.

170
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:49,159
Rym: But the main argument against DRM all those other arguments aside and all the others didn't even make is That it only hurts the people who actually did pay you money.

171
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:53,712
Rym: Yep, and Ubisoft proved this epically when just all this press.

172
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:54,634
Rym: you know their DRM.

173
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:55,437
Rym: It's uncrackable.

174
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:56,620
Rym: it got cracked right away.

175
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:58,346
Rym: Their servers went down.

176
00:10:58,587 --> 00:11:02,120
Rym: the only people who actually could play the game were the people who pirated it.

177
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:03,946
Scott: So I think this is why people are.

178
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:07,196
Scott: you know steam and Netflix are the two people with DRM.

179
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,460
Scott: they get away with it because?

180
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:09,464
Scott: It works.

181
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:10,588
Scott: It actually does work.

182
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,254
Scott: You know steam doesn't really go down.

183
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:13,880
Scott: You know the offline play.

184
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,404
Scott: You know they keep fixing it.

185
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:17,149
Scott: It works mostly perfectly.

186
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:25,366
Scott: Yeah, you know the Netflix has you know DRM, but it works and Nobody complains about it because it just works.

187
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:38,295
Scott: and of course you know if this Ubisoft Assassin's Creed DRM had worked then Nobody would have laughed at it, but because it was cracked and because the server went down everyone goes aha You're right you fail.

188
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:43,475
Rym: Well even you know cracked or not doesn't matter because that's not going to affect the bottom line.

189
00:11:43,516 --> 00:11:48,258
Rym: if the game like this never gets Cracked then all the people who would pirate it just won't ever play it.

190
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,379
Rym: yep Or at most they'll buy it in the discount bin a couple of years from now.

191
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:56,957
Scott: Yep But you know you think if you know what if they would have made the game $5 discount bin price.

192
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:58,443
Scott: to begin with Sales.

193
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:01,317
Scott: the sales would have been more than 10 times as much.

194
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:01,920
Scott: What are they charging?

195
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,955
Scott: I think 60 for the game, so they would have been more than 12 times as much.

196
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:16,450
Scott: right they would have made More money and all those people who went on to you know wait for the crack or whatever would have said I was five bucks Whatever and just bought it because it would be easier that way.

197
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:22,519
Rym: see now if we go back to the root issue of just people Don't value these entertainment options enough to pay money for them.

198
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:27,640
Rym: What about the the people like us who don't pirate but buy everything in the discount bin?

199
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,964
Rym: That I think hurts the industry just as much as piracy, but yet That's perfectly legal.

200
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:38,000
Scott: and well the argument you can make against that the argument comic book people make this argument all the time.

201
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,370
Scott: They say oh you got to buy the issues.

202
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,620
Scott: You can't be buying the trades.

203
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,520
Scott: You're hurting the you know artists, and I'm like if they don't make the trade then oh, but they have to to make the money.

204
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,538
Scott: I'm like gee Make up your mind.

205
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:57,280
Scott: Either they need to do it to make the money yet, but they'd be making more money if you you know bought the issues.

206
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:58,477
Scott: It's not a charity.

207
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:01,339
Scott: Go listen to that episode of GeekNights.

208
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:03,188
Rym: Wow that was a long time ago.

209
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,580
Rym: Yeah, it's like we were fighting with anime world order.

210
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:06,763
Scott: It's not a charity.

211
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:08,488
Scott: right consumer is number one.

212
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,935
Scott: businesses that recognize consumers number ten.

213
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:13,303
Scott: right those are the businesses That'll be king.

214
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:16,654
Scott: businesses that say our business is number one and consumer is number ten.

215
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:18,200
Scott: those businesses fuck them.

216
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:20,908
Scott: We should steal from them because they're basically just assholes.

217
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,500
Rym: now see I guess it's tricky that all this argue and this happens forever.

218
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,199
Rym: Everyone rabbles out piracy and DRM on the internet and punk kids always rabble like DRM blah blah blah.

219
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:31,443
Rym: It's evil I'm gonna pirate.

220
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:36,840
Rym: I'll show them and they conflate some moral cause with their piracy which is pretty BS.

221
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,550
Rym: But at the same time yeah, what's wrong with you know?

222
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:53,651
Rym: I think people have been looking down on Civil disobedience lately and I think we need to most of the people I see who pirate stuff and conflate any sort of moral stand Don't actually have any moral stand as far as I can tell.

223
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,612
Rym: all they really have to say is I don't want to pay for this game.

224
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:02,720
Scott: The other thing I think is that when someone we've been going on about this too long.

225
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:18,319
Rym: Yeah, but the root issue is just that even if there is perfect DRM Until we also lose our right to first sale the discount bin is more of a threat to gaming or at least the current gaming industry than piracy ever was Because the discount bin people still buy games.

226
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:19,144
Scott: They're actually.

227
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,720
Scott: I'll talk about it on the next show once I get the info.

228
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,060
Scott: But there actually was a Linux game DRM developed recently that allowed you to resell the game with some clever technology.

229
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,199
Rym: That is a good idea alright, so anyway.

230
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:35,112
Scott: So in the other news steam related right.

231
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:39,400
Scott: everyone probably knows this by now, but better Yeah, but steam is coming to the Mac.

232
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,094
Scott: I should have realized this when they switched from IE to webkit.

233
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:49,275
Scott: you know in the in the steam beta That's one of those situations where the nerds of the world said it's like oh, I should have seen.

234
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,360
Scott: that was kind of obvious.

235
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,165
Scott: What's wrong with me?

236
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,600
Scott: anyway, so you know the thing is okay?

237
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,365
Scott: So how is this gonna work right?

238
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:56,849
Scott: what games exactly?

239
00:14:56,869 --> 00:15:00,600
Scott: because most games on steam are not are obviously not gonna be ported right?

240
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,888
Scott: So which games and such and such?

241
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,159
Scott: so basically here's here's the rundown right?

242
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:16,844
Scott: Valve is porting the source engine right, so I don't think that includes For example Half-Life 1 or NS Source source.

243
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:20,762
Scott: yes, it includes like Counter-Strike source, but I don't think you can play original I don't.

244
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,031
Scott: it doesn't seem like they're doing the original Half-Life.

245
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:23,634
Rym: and here's the thing.

246
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,080
Scott: no only doing the source engine.

247
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,760
Rym: No one on a Mac gives one shit about Counter-Strike 1 6, but they can't play NS 1.

248
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,544
Scott: They'll only be able to play.

249
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,248
Scott: you know.

250
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:33,394
Scott: and will they be able to play NS 2?

251
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:35,740
Rym: probably not either yeah But that's a separate issue.

252
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,350
Scott: Anyway, so other interesting pieces of information.

253
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,860
Scott: right if you already have these games purchased on Steam And you get a Mac you can just download them.

254
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,984
Scott: You don't to pay for the game again You know.

255
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:53,253
Scott: so if I have a Mac laptop and a Windows desktop I can and I have Half-Life 2 I can just download Half-Life 2 on my.

256
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:55,822
Scott: you know Mac You know Sony.

257
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,569
Rym: you can learn a thing or two from this.

258
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:06,321
Rym: I Still think the best way For game publishers to make a whole bunch of money is to have don't give away No Don't do?

259
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,024
Rym: it seemed it don't.

260
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:10,519
Rym: do the good thing and give every version of the game to someone who bought it.

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,155
Rym: But say all right you bought Street Fighter on the PC for five bucks.

262
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,359
Rym: You can have it on your Xbox, too.

263
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:20,420
Scott: Yeah, the other question is you know what about the graphics hardware?

264
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,093
Scott: You know because people play games on computers with.

265
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:29,980
Scott: you know high-end video cards And you know the Macs don't really have poopy video cards, but they don't have great video cards either.

266
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,936
Scott: They've got like you know g-forces and whatever, but they're not high-end.

267
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:34,940
Scott: They're not way powerful.

268
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:44,828
Scott: They can almost definitely do like Half-Life 2 But could they do like Left 4 Dead 2 you know which needs a little more power to do like the level with the rain And the storm and all that?

269
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,383
Rym: also what kinds of drivers I mean they're?

270
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:51,880
Rym: they're not gonna have the same kind of Nvidia driver that I have I guess an Nvidia chip.

271
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:55,493
Scott: Yeah, so you know they're basically they're extending.

272
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:58,818
Scott: the source engine is support OpenGL And you know I guess they're gonna have to.

273
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:00,847
Scott: The thing is at least they don't have to.

274
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,879
Scott: it's gonna be pretty easy because they won't have to scale it to.

275
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:10,448
Scott: you know Support different levels of graphics as much because it's pretty much only so many Macs And you know you know what they all have.

276
00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:12,079
Scott: so you be like oh, this is a MacBook Pro.

277
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,566
Scott: These are the settings you know.

278
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:16,839
Rym: in fact they could probably do something like you know how steam detects your settings.

279
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:18,589
Rym: They do those periodic hardware surveys.

280
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,239
Scott: They're gonna do the hardware survey on the Mac.

281
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:23,929
Rym: Yeah, it's gonna be really interesting But what the cool thing will be if I were them?

282
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:33,772
Rym: what I would do is have it figure out exactly which Mac It is and then have some people who spend the time to figure out the optimum Graphics settings for each game for each kind of Mac.

283
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:34,635
Scott: mm-hmm.

284
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:36,040
Rym: just to give Mac.

285
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,440
Rym: You know you gotta give Mac people the Mac experience.

286
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:44,645
Rym: It's got to just work there with no fiddling and be perfect immediately or at least as good as that Particular Mac can do.

287
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:53,179
Scott: our Mac mini over there is not gonna be playing any half-life - yeah Still the thing that I worry about though is like you know the Mac still doesn't have.

288
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:57,818
Scott: you know It's not gonna help them out with a lot of other things like you can't really use a joystick on the Mac.

289
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:00,206
Rym: that well Well, you can but here's the problem.

290
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:05,443
Rym: hardly barely if you pay for third-party software that does it well You know, but there's.

291
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,533
Scott: you know they might build something in.

292
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:12,312
Scott: it's like to add joystick support But the Mac OS itself doesn't have joystick support in it.

293
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:12,834
Scott: You know.

294
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:19,938
Scott: so they had to add that Themselves because I know for example Team Fortress 2 you can play with an Xbox 360 controller on Windows.

295
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:23,203
Scott: if that's your thing I don't know why you would do that For that game.

296
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:24,447
Rym: you're not missing that much.

297
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,132
Rym: Yeah games the mouse anyway.

298
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:32,112
Scott: The second thing is like in win in When you're using Windows you have like a you know PC keyboard.

299
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:34,040
Scott: trying to game with a Mac keyboard.

300
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:35,970
Scott: You know it's not gonna work out too.

301
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,622
Scott: Well like most Macs are laptops You know.

302
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:43,578
Scott: and if even if you have a desktop Mac if you have a Mac Mouse God help you right right?

303
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:47,673
Scott: So you know if you're gonna game on a Mac you're.

304
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:53,540
Scott: even if these games work You're still gonna need like a PC Mouse and keyboard to get the right experience.

305
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:57,479
Scott: Maybe you could use a PC Mouse with the Mac keyboard the chiclets.

306
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:59,732
Scott: well It would still kind of suck, but it would be.

307
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:00,759
Rym: I at least have a fish.

308
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:07,040
Rym: I remember when Emily very pointedly got a Microsoft Mouse, and she was like it has three buttons.

309
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:10,878
Rym: Yeah, I think a lot of Mac users use real mice.

310
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:17,998
Scott: now You know Pete there are people who are fans of the Mighty Mouse and there were people who are fans of the new Magic Mouse And it's sort of a love it or hate it thing.

311
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:25,156
Scott: But the Magic Mouse even if you're one of those people who loves it You know which I think is maybe like five percent of people maybe even less than that.

312
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:29,320
Scott: all right You can't really game with gestures.

313
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:31,967
Scott: You know that is not precision enough.

314
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:32,268
Scott: Well.

315
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:35,640
Scott: You know you do gesture, and you're like you change three weapons.

316
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,004
Scott: It's like I know how.

317
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:38,248
Scott: you know how you need to have clicks.

318
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:41,980
Scott: you can scroll exactly one to change your weapon exactly one.

319
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,516
Rym: Here's another problem something that is far more subtle that I don't think anyone has taken into account.

320
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:55,439
Rym: on Windows Everything's great when I play an FPS, but remember when I bought the Mac mini And I tried the mouse sensitivity was the worst max.

321
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:57,091
Rym: It works fine.

322
00:19:57,132 --> 00:20:08,098
Rym: if you're a desktop browser And you're not used to like ultra high precision like very kind of granular it like Fiddly mouse controls, which I like I have my mouse way way up.

323
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:09,388
Rym: Yes I have that fancy mouse.

324
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,563
Rym: now if I put it to the max It's literally.

325
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:15,340
Rym: I move it a millimeter and the mouse is all the way across the screen mm-hmm.

326
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,905
Rym: So I had to actually turn it down.

327
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:20,537
Rym: you cannot play an FPS with the way max handle mice by default.

328
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,191
Scott: well actually at work I have a Mac right which I'm not a fan of but that's what I got.

329
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:25,696
Rym: so how's the mouse sensitivity?

330
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:30,000
Scott: it's terrible But I have this Logitech g6 gaming mouse.

331
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:39,950
Scott: It's just a wired you know gaming mouse And it has buttons to move the sensitivity up and down has three different sensitivity settings And it's in the hardware of the mouse that it changes this.

332
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:46,960
Scott: so if I up the sensitivity in this gaming mouse To like the second or third level it actually becomes pretty good right.

333
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:52,927
Scott: So if you get like you know say your mouse there right to work with the Mac I don't think it does.

334
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:54,520
Rym: I think it'll work as a mouse.

335
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:55,303
Rym: I don't know.

336
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:55,805
Rym: I gotta try.

337
00:20:55,825 --> 00:21:02,869
Scott: you can get the hardware of the mouse to jack up the sensitivity as Opposed to letting the Mac OS handle it.

338
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:06,720
Scott: then you can probably get a passable mouse sensitivity experience.

339
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:08,751
Scott: But you still you need to get in gaming mouse.

340
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:09,777
Scott: You know I can play.

341
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:17,820
Scott: you know It's not the greatest, but I can use like a Dell two button with a scroll wheel USB mouse right with a red optical normalness.

342
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,709
Scott: It's not the greatest But I can play an FPS with that just fine.

343
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:31,620
Rym: hey having grown up with the era of Optical mice that you could not use for gaming or before that real mice Yeah, remember like picking up the mouse and like tapping the tapping down together.

344
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:35,233
Rym: Yeah, I used to use that wheel like as part of my gaming.

345
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,598
Rym: I had to take that wheel into account.

346
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:38,540
Scott: yep I had a gaming mouse.

347
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,011
Scott: I think I still have it a logic USB gaming mouse that had.

348
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:48,770
Scott: it was just three buttons didn't before scroll wheels were around Right and it had a ball, but it was a bigger ball than usual.

349
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,397
Scott: It was like an extra-large ball for gaming.

350
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:55,493
Rym: so I See you've got the biggest balls of them all.

351
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:56,419
Scott: I had the biggest ball.

352
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:59,974
Rym: I had a friend who used a trackball for FPS.

353
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:01,540
Scott: is that's still a good call?

354
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:07,000
Rym: Yeah, this gigantic trackball It was the kind that'll cut your finger off if you get it going too fast and catch it down at the edge.

355
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,659
Scott: Yeah, it's still a good move if you can if you're used to it especially for rampart.

356
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:22,300
Rym: What he always wanted and he talked about this almost every day You know back when we're really into FPS is he wanted a mouse that had a trackball in it That was ultra like ultra low sensitivity.

357
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:28,949
Rym: So he basically used the mouse for his normal FPS and but then when he was sniping He just put his finger on that trackball there.

358
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,093
Scott: Why don't we make that?

359
00:22:30,153 --> 00:22:30,555
Scott: we could make.

360
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:38,843
Scott: it would just be a mouse with a thumb Trackball and a middle finger scroll wheel right and then two buttons for index and ring finger Right.

361
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:43,297
Scott: and basically what you would do is the the mouse itself be a laser mouse.

362
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:50,840
Scott: that would work normally But the thumb scroll the trackball would also always be on and would be ultra low sensitivity.

363
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:58,379
Scott: So you could you could do a sweeping movement towards the enemy, but then precisionally aim exactly at his head with the thumb.

364
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:01,673
Rym: Of course I can do something similar.

365
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,680
Rym: now that I got that fancy mouse I can click the button that goes between ultra high and ultra low.

366
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:13,480
Scott: Yeah, that's what I can do with the mouse that I have at work And that's actually becoming very popular these days is the gaming mouse that allows you to change sensitivity.

367
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:19,060
Scott: So, you know you go you just you're sniping and you change you drop the sensitivity and then you're running.

368
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,490
Scott: So you crank it way up.

369
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:28,573
Rym: what I haven't done yet But I used to I'll admit I used to do this back in the like action quake days I would actually change my vertical sensitivity as opposed my horizontal.

370
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:36,274
Rym: Whoa, so I'd basically pseudo lock my mouse at head level and then just sweep left and right.

371
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:40,003
Rym: basically, yes, and it worked Horrifyingly well.

372
00:23:40,364 --> 00:23:41,468
Scott: that works incredibly.

373
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:46,210
Scott: Well, the thing is if you duck you've got a. you know You've got to have two different lock position.

374
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,800
Rym: No, what you do is you set up the law.

375
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,140
Scott: I guess there's no ducking and quake.

376
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,293
Scott: But if you're playing counter-strike you would need to position the way the mouse works.

377
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:53,940
Rym: is you pick you make all these profiles.

378
00:23:54,403 --> 00:24:05,380
Rym: So what I could do is have a profile for counter-strike Let's say where if I hit a certain button or I hold it down or whatever it basically Cuts down my vertical sensitivity to almost nothing.

379
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:12,059
Rym: So I go up to head level while I'm shooting at someone and as soon as I'm at a head level I hit this and it locks on head level.

380
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:16,174
Rym: Now at what point does this become cheating?

381
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,641
Rym: yeah, I Don't know.

382
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:19,606
Rym: I mean, I'm just.

383
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,596
Rym: I'm not actually aim botting.

384
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:24,169
Rym: if I do that I'm just changing the way.

385
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:29,291
Scott: I personally have to aim horizontally Yes, and you can still move the mouse vertically.

386
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,395
Scott: It just take a lot of work.

387
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:31,580
Rym: I could set it to zero.

388
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:38,520
Scott: Yeah The other thing is that you know in a game like say counter-strike you we try to do that with the para The recoil would move you out of position and be very different.

389
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,016
Scott: You know if you had the low sensitivity you couldn't get back down true true for sniping.

390
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:43,980
Scott: It would be very effective.

391
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:55,508
Rym: The other thing you can do is it actually lets me specify, you know All mines do sorts of corrections Like if you're trying to draw in a straight line most mice will kind of guide you into a straight line if they think it's Obvious you're doing a straight line.

392
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:56,011
Scott: Yeah, all the.

393
00:24:56,152 --> 00:25:07,073
Scott: actually there was a good Article I read that showed how the different Touchscreens and the different phones correct for when you're sliding around And it showed how pretty much the iPhone does.

394
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:08,139
Scott: does it better than everyone else?

395
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,064
Rym: Things of the day.

396
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:19,551
Rym: This is totally just ripped off from College Humor.

397
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,396
Rym: I try to avoid that but I had to.

398
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,911
Rym: I Like the song.

399
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:27,970
Rym: I'm on a boat Not like ironically like he.

400
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,817
Rym: he I mean I just straight-up like it.

401
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:30,700
Rym: I think it's a great song.

402
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:31,520
Scott: It's an okay song.

403
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,820
Rym: I like it a little bit independent of all the humor and all the side stuff and the meta and the meme and everything.

404
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:43,424
Rym: I like the song and I feel like the people behind the song where I don't know if we've talked about them But they they've gotten.

405
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:47,958
Rym: they've improved their comedic songwriting abilities with every iteration of songs.

406
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:50,851
Rym: They have done Mmm, I look forward to future songs by them.

407
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:56,436
Rym: Hmm and a while ago, you know We did the I'm on a boat and we did that cool cover that a bunch of Navy guys did like.

408
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,264
Rym: they basically filmed their Own music video to it.

409
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:00,272
Rym: I now have to present to you.

410
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,300
Rym: I'm on a boat the death metal cover.

411
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:03,502
Scott: You know what?

412
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:12,012
Scott: I saw today, you know, amv hell not anime hell that you know, which is what you do at a convention Hell something that you show at a convention, right?

413
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:14,440
Scott: So amv hell did like this these video.

414
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,879
Scott: That's like a bunch of little me and these hells tiny ones all grouped up in a one YouTube video.

415
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:27,060
Scott: And the final video of this collection was Pokemon, I'm on a boat using you know, the boat that's in the first Pokemon.

416
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:27,964
Rym: That's okay.

417
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:28,868
Scott: It was pretty funny.

418
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:34,334
Scott: I don't think it's anywhere near mindless self-indulgence But it was still you know, a little Pokemon.

419
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:35,059
Scott: I'm on a boat was fun.

420
00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:36,949
Scott: Okay, it's my thing today.

421
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:37,170
Scott: Yep.

422
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,180
Scott: There's this guy named Jake Adelstein.

423
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:43,458
Scott: I didn't know about him until today, but apparently he's you know more famous than us.

424
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:43,760
Scott: at least.

425
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:47,734
Scott: He is an American Jew from the Midwest, right?

426
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:52,771
Scott: Obviously with the name like Adelstein Obviously from the Midwest right and you know what his job was.

427
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,301
Scott: I Don't know.

428
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:56,366
Scott: his job was.

429
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:59,580
Scott: he was the crime reporter for a newspaper in Japan.

430
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:04,749
Scott: That and he lived in Japan and he was a crime reporter All right, and basically he became just.

431
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,977
Scott: his life became a life of Yakuza.

432
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:11,799
Rym: Oh This guy I think he was on the Daily Show.

433
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,684
Scott: I think he was.

434
00:27:12,724 --> 00:27:14,332
Scott: people were saying something about that in the comments.

435
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:15,880
Rym: I think I saw him on the Daily Show.

436
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,391
Scott: Yeah, so I want to see him on the Daily Show.

437
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:22,683
Rym: now that I know that I'll find the episode cuz if it I remember Seeing an interview.

438
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:29,228
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was on the Daily Show where he was talking about how he like he covered up all this Stuff he uncovered for a while because he didn't want to die.

439
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,777
Scott: Yeah, he apparently carries around a titanium umbrella.

440
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:37,819
Scott: I Should carry instead of a new umbrella instead of a baseball bat because you know, it's just like whatever.

441
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:40,759
Scott: But if you try to fuck with him, he'll just bash you over the head.

442
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:44,259
Scott: And he apparently had to break a dude's knee once with a golf club.

443
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:45,745
Rym: Uh-huh some Yakuza men.

444
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:48,294
Rym: if the Yakuza can't take this guy out.

445
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:50,040
Rym: I mean, what if they sunk?

446
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,966
Scott: Well, I think it's.

447
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:57,340
Scott: he basically is in a situation You know, he played it cuz he was so smart and in with it, you know, and apparently Yakuza always keep their word.

448
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:03,580
Rym: Well, he did this whole expose and how the Yakuza would come to America to get possibly black market livers.

449
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:11,952
Scott: Well, no, there's one guy in particular who was like the biggest Yakuza who came to get a liver Candle in the Daily Show thing he implied.

450
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:17,110
Rym: I recall that that was common Because Yakuza lose the livers real fast.

451
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:22,589
Scott: Oh, yeah, but anyway, so, you know There's a really good interview with him on Boeing Boeing here.

452
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,500
Scott: that says a lot of interesting things and apparently he's got a couple books.

453
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,231
Scott: I'm gonna go buy his books because they need a book.

454
00:28:28,612 --> 00:28:30,440
Scott: Yeah, they say I like Yakuza.

455
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,384
Scott: At least I you know, I don't.

456
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:34,699
Scott: actually I don't actually like Yakuza.

457
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,156
Scott: in that I think they are, you know, I want to be one.

458
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,280
Scott: well I want to be involved with them.

459
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:45,805
Scott: But in that, you know, it is it be mystique of Yakuza is cool because I've sort of you know I had my fill of.

460
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:49,240
Scott: you know, Italian mafia so now and Russian mafia.

461
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:49,865
Scott: So now it's like.

462
00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:51,176
Scott: well, I need to get some eyes.

463
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:51,720
Scott: mafia.

464
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,820
Rym: You want to be a Yakuza or a British naval captain?

465
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:01,220
Rym: But only if they are like we see them in sanctuary in Horatio exactly and not if they're like the real world exactly.

466
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,819
Rym: I don't want to actually have been to the West Indies.

467
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:07,718
Scott: I do want to have been to the West Indies on a cruise.

468
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:10,448
Scott: Yes Going on a boat.

469
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,160
Rym: I don't want to be suffering from tropical diseases in a wooden boat.

470
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:20,071
Scott: but anyway, this dude is really fascinating and I want to Check out his books cuz they sound awesome.

471
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:21,718
Rym: Yeah, I'll have to find that Daily Show for you.

472
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:27,406
Rym: Yeah So speaking of books, it's the meta Minute in a moment.

473
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:27,908
Scott: We don't know.

474
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:34,780
Scott: Anyway, so number one, of course book club is Carl Sagan's cosmos one of the most important.

475
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:43,425
Scott: I was thinking do you want to change book club to like the Like book of the quarter like we do for a year or book of the by month Like we do one every two months?

476
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:44,689
Scott: some guarantee like that.

477
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,352
Rym: I don't know.

478
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:47,640
Rym: Have you started reading cosmos yet new?

479
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,466
Scott: Well, do you have a copy for me?

480
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:50,550
Rym: I have one copy.

481
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:52,699
Rym: Are you my old copy that I'm reading again?

482
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,264
Scott: Well when you're done, I'll take it.

483
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,812
Scott: All right, unless I get to the library first.

484
00:29:56,993 --> 00:29:59,120
Rym: cuz you know, I'm sure it's in the library.

485
00:29:59,345 --> 00:29:59,999
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure.

486
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:03,007
Rym: Maybe just call it the club.

487
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:05,075
Scott: Okay edgy something like that.

488
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:10,376
Scott: Anyway news number two PAX East not PAX West yet.

489
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:13,389
Scott: So there's actually you know, there's.

490
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:14,673
Scott: the panels are doing.

491
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:18,745
Scott: it PAX East all three and Asterisk one of them.

492
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:22,796
Rym: Yep beyond Dungeons & Dragons beyond candy land beyond your mom.

493
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:24,280
Scott: No, not beyond your mom.

494
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:33,331
Rym: losing should be fun and we are hopefully helping in the second half of Action Castle action castle.

495
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:34,097
Scott: There's our panels.

496
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:36,567
Scott: Okay The schedule is out.

497
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,760
Scott: You can go find out when and where our panels will be.

498
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,520
Scott: I think they're all in the wyvern theater.

499
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:44,976
Scott: I have a feeling that the running person running the wyvern theater is an awesome person.

500
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:45,779
Rym: it may in fact be.

501
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,045
Rym: well We don't want to.

502
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:48,635
Scott: I just have a feeling about this.

503
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:49,258
Scott: It's a hunch.

504
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:53,813
Scott: There are some additional news about this convention.

505
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,219
Scott: Yes late-breaking news.

506
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:03,267
Scott: Now we were worried because when you for every packs in all of history every West Coast packs when you applied to packs You would check off a box.

507
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:03,568
Scott: Yes.

508
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,673
Scott: I want to be in a mega knot.

509
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:05,979
Scott: No, I do not right.

510
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:11,940
Scott: and Then they would select the Omega knots they would contact them and they'd say hey, do you want to be an Omega knot?

511
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,401
Scott: Yes, no.

512
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:13,063
Scott: Hey do right.

513
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:20,178
Scott: and then at the convention they had finally selected 16 Omega knots and they would go And compete in the Omega thon.

514
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:23,760
Scott: There was no such questionnaire for the PAX East.

515
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:31,440
Rym: So we're just like is there even gonna be you know Megathon at PAX East and you know We're doing a lot of stuff like planning for packs the panels and everything.

516
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:36,113
Rym: But I never thought to actually ask the the people who would have known.

517
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,018
Rym: Hey, what's the deal with the Omega thon?

518
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:46,239
Scott: So There is gonna be an Omega thon at PAX East and when I first read what they were gonna do I was like that what are they doing the morons?

519
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,829
Scott: Because what they said they were gonna do is okay.

520
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:51,379
Scott: when you get to PAX in your bag is gonna be a card.

521
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,557
Scott: you fill It out and you drop it in a thing at the keynote if you want to be in the Omega thon.

522
00:31:55,598 --> 00:31:58,265
Scott: I'm like, whoa What are they doing?

523
00:31:58,406 --> 00:32:00,093
Scott: signing up online is so much better.

524
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:01,198
Scott: Why did they make it worse?

525
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:01,660
Scott: What is wrong?

526
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,506
Scott: All right, it's better than that.

527
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:05,795
Scott: Here is here is the genius of this move, right?

528
00:32:05,835 --> 00:32:07,040
Scott: You think that's a stupid move.

529
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,939
Scott: Why would you do things the old paper way when the technology way as far as superior number one?

530
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,032
Scott: The effort of emailing people saying do you want to be Omega knot?

531
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:14,273
Scott: Yes.

532
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:14,916
Scott: No, right?

533
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:15,760
Scott: No good.

534
00:32:16,182 --> 00:32:19,920
Scott: This way if someone fills out the card, they're at the convention.

535
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:21,749
Scott: They just said they want to do it.

536
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:24,080
Scott: right then and there you don't have to do this.

537
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,468
Scott: You know work of filtering the people out.

538
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:29,660
Rym: This also gives them they can do the come on down.

539
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,257
Scott: Yeah, because what they'll do is after the keynote they'll sift through the cards and pull out the names and it'd be like Scott Ruben your You know.

540
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:51,040
Scott: And then you go up to the front and you line up on the stage and then they'll say these the Omega knots whoo Even more awesome did not think this is possible.

541
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:58,800
Scott: But you know This is PAX the convention of magic where everything is always more awesome than you suspected it would ever be and more than awesome Than you could possibly imagine.

542
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,786
Scott: This Omega thon at PAX East is going to be an all team game Omega thon teams of two.

543
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:08,013
Scott: you do not get to choose your teammate.

544
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,040
Scott: It is random pulled out of the Hat.

545
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:16,120
Scott: So the greatest gamer in the world be paired up with someone who just wanted to do it for fun or who knows what?

546
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,829
Rym: I look forward to versus team co-op style.

547
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:31,267
Scott: every game is gonna be a two-player game such as double dash, you know such as Geometry Wars 2 Such as some unnamed rhythm game.

548
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:35,520
Scott: those are rounds one through three rounds four and of course five are unknown.

549
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:40,400
Scott: I'm trying to speculate of course about the final round and what it will entail.

550
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:44,500
Scott: Obviously, it will be some sort of co-op game of at least teams of two.

551
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,993
Scott: It could be an FPS because any deathmatch FPS will work.

552
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:48,635
Rym: Yeah, though.

553
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:49,880
Rym: I feel like that'd be a cop-out.

554
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,230
Rym: They got it.

555
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:57,020
Scott: It could be a sports game like double dribble or you know One of those sports games where you only really need two people per side.

556
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:58,065
Scott: But I don't.

557
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:04,220
Rym: they don't seem big on sports games, you know at packs I I think old school is the way they would go.

558
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:07,820
Scott: It could be like pong program because there are pongs that are two verse two.

559
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,300
Scott: But then again, it could just be straight-up table tennis like physical table tennis.

560
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:20,579
Scott: I would hope that it'd be Mario tennis, which really makes you realize man It could be Mario Party also and it's like it makes you realize not be Mario Party.

561
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:31,179
Scott: The closing ceremonies cannot be nine hours long But it's so crazy that just about every game you think of that could handle like two versus two.

562
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,722
Scott: is Mario?

563
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:41,857
Rym: it's like Mario tennis Mario Party, you know Mario Kart double dash really really old-school games Like there's a lot of Atari games that have team play two versus two.

564
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:44,507
Rym: Yeah Or you can shoehorn it in.

565
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,092
Scott: Yeah, I mean they could.

566
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:51,717
Scott: you know, you could always do like, you know You know Mario and Luigi, you know, just Mario Brothers.

567
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:53,364
Scott: and then you know Two people are.

568
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,860
Scott: you know play, you know, they have two separate games high score.

569
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:57,499
Scott: You could always jury-rig it like that.

570
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,920
Rym: But I remember the last time we were in a Mario Brothers tournament that was for high score.

571
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:04,675
Scott: It could also be an RTS, you know, you can do Starcraft 2v2.

572
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,640
Rym: Do you remember that?

573
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,767
Scott: It could be Starcraft 2 2v2.

574
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:14,340
Rym: Scott's trying so hard to get his points and I just asked the moderator Hey, what happens if I kill Scott and he's like, well, I guess he can't get any more points.

575
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:16,194
Rym: I pushed him into a fireball in one first place.

576
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:20,795
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so that you know, that's I'm really curious as to what it's gonna be.

577
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:21,960
Scott: Hopefully it'll be something awesome.

578
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:28,555
Scott: And I know I know a Boston anime boss is the week after PAX East.

579
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:30,300
Rym: we're doing a ton of panels there.

580
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:41,520
Rym: In fact, we're doing Basically brand new panels for many of you because shit think about it All the panels were doing an anime Boston ConnectiCon panels or either working out account panels.

581
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,515
Rym: But more importantly they were awesome new panels that all the other anime cons.

582
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:46,439
Rym: for whatever reason we're like.

583
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:48,159
Rym: no We don't want your new good stuff.

584
00:35:48,381 --> 00:35:49,628
Rym: We want you to run the same shitty.

585
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,840
Rym: how to run an anime club panel again.

586
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:53,185
Scott: Are we running that same shitty?

587
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:54,410
Scott: how to run an anime club panel again?

588
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,438
Rym: Yes, but we've never run it at anime Boston.

589
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,723
Scott: Oh All right.

590
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:00,071
Scott: What else are we doing at anime Boston?

591
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,800
Rym: Ah, we're doing bite-sized anime.

592
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,542
Rym: That's a good one.

593
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:07,058
Rym: We're doing anime you should see and we're doing anime openers from around the world.

594
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:10,909
Rym: Oh snap Let me tell you I got some gold.

595
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:11,812
Scott: Some gold Jerry.

596
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:14,218
Rym: I've completely reworked that stupid panel.

597
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:18,519
Rym: Good God All right, and we're probably gonna do some other stuff.

598
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:20,231
Rym: That's all TBA.

599
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,380
Rym: I don't have the schedule in front of me.

600
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:29,548
Scott: Okay And the final bit of meta is that we are doing some you streams if you are not watching them already because barely anyone is Which I can't blame you.

601
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:30,980
Scott: basically we're practicing.

602
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:37,844
Rym: We're pretty much just going to start you streaming and recording in some fashion every normal episode of GeekNights Just to put it up there.

603
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:42,580
Scott: Yeah, and we're also you know, we're doing some live streaming things outside of GeekNights.

604
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,560
Scott: We're basically realized that you know, we knew for a long time video was the future, but we were so lazy about it.

605
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,695
Scott: But now I'm just like well, you know what?

606
00:36:48,735 --> 00:36:51,894
Scott: Fuck it We just have to just turn on a webcam at the very least.

607
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:54,671
Scott: We got to do something We got to learn something about this.

608
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:55,819
Scott: Let's just do it.

609
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:59,679
Scott: So now we finally we're just gonna turn webcams on all the time.

610
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:05,017
Scott: I'm even looking into you know, this trying to bring up some you streaming from packs and such.

611
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:05,860
Scott: we're gonna work that out.

612
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,199
Scott: Maybe we'll see.

613
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:11,772
Rym: Okay, yep, so stay tuned for more on that front.

614
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,855
Scott: so does the computer notice?

615
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,439
Scott: stay tuned for more on that front.

616
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:19,994
Rym: paranoia Interestingly enough, you know when paranoia was first released?

617
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:31,239
Rym: the 80s 1984 yeah But I think that's a very poignant number for paranoia, I wonder if that was intentional to some degree I hope so.

618
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:36,639
Rym: You know would be even better if that wasn't true and someone had edited Wikipedia to make it true.

619
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:41,620
Scott: That would be pretty awesome If someone had you know edited Wikipedia to put in a joke like that.

620
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:44,543
Scott: But no, I think it actually was released in 1984.

621
00:37:44,543 --> 00:37:47,980
Rym: So basically the deal like as far as I can tell with paranoia.

622
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:58,618
Rym: almost every gamer in the world who's at least a Convention gamer or an old-school gamer or a role-playing gamer anyone outside of I just play Pokemon or I just play D&D.

623
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,378
Scott: You know if you've been to any gaming con pretty much any tabletop role-playing gamer who is beyond the who?

624
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:15,346
Scott: Has reached the point at which they realize D&D is not the only tabletop role-playing game has at least heard of Paranoia and knows at least a little about.

625
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:19,700
Rym: but my suspicion and I see this a lot most gamers don't know anything about it.

626
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:38,807
Rym: Almost everyone I run into they know about paranoia they know the gist of it and they have some crazy anecdote from either a time they saw some people playing it at a Convention or they ran into a game of it somewhere or they encountered it in some oblique way But they themselves had never played it.

627
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,539
Scott: Yeah, very few people have actually played it relatively speaking.

628
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:49,472
Scott: Of course I mean what the first packs who went up during the Q&A and we made this paranoia joke and taiko got it But nobody else got it.

629
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:50,580
Scott: really they had no clue.

630
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:57,660
Rym: Of course They didn't answer our question because it was telling that the pecs attendee badges were all red and then our panelist badges were blue.

631
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:00,600
Scott: And yeah, and they all access badges were violet.

632
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,800
Rym: There's no way someone in that chain of thought was not thinking paranoid.

633
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:09,360
Scott: Someone was picking the colors based on some sort of paranoia based logic or just Roy G Biv.

634
00:39:09,882 --> 00:39:14,220
Scott: So I guess a short explanation of a paranoia is in order because I assume most people have no idea what's going on.

635
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,652
Scott: So it's a tabletop RPG, right?

636
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,980
Scott: But it takes place in sort of like a dystopian sci-fi future where there was a nuclear war.

637
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,507
Scott: There's gonna be a nuclear war.

638
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:28,268
Scott: who knows and everyone lives and like, you know These cities controlled by the computer.

639
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:31,080
Scott: It's a lot like Phoenix future the second volume of Tezuka's Phoenix.

640
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:34,713
Rym: Or take say Logan's run Logan's run very similar.

641
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:48,132
Scott: mash it up with brave new world yeah, so there's a computer that controls everything and basically you can't piss off the computer or else you'll just die and All the people living there are arranged by color, right?

642
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,637
Scott: So red is the lowest color.

643
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:52,430
Rym: That's the troubleshooter That's not the lowest here now.

644
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:53,838
Scott: Oh, you're right this zoom out.

645
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:58,900
Rym: The story is that they set up a computer and the computer was to control this kind of vault.

646
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:12,897
Rym: You know if you played Fallout about shelter because it's cold war there's gonna be a nuclear war or something someday maybe and One thing leads to another and the computer decides that the best way to protect everyone is to nuke everything out there and never let Anyone go outside again?

647
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:29,160
Rym: Mm-hmm, so people everyone in the world as far as you know lives in the paranoia world this kind of underground vault that's controlled by the computer and Everyone is desperately afraid of the communists that are clearly trying to undermine the computer and kill everybody.

648
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:32,562
Rym: Yep, everyone is also secretly a communist Mm-hmm.

649
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:36,993
Rym: Everyone is afraid of the mutants who are trying to kill everyone and make everyone mutants.

650
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:39,540
Rym: Everyone is also secretly a mutant.

651
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:42,080
Rym: That is the world of paranoia.

652
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:43,280
Rym: Everyone is paranoid.

653
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:49,360
Rym: Every asshole is trying to kill you for some reason or other and you're just watching your back and trying not to die.

654
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:54,440
Scott: Now this game has actually been released multiple different times and each version was crook slightly.

655
00:40:54,601 --> 00:41:01,804
Scott: So, you know those some versions were really serious and dystopian and like whoa some were really silly You know and humorous.

656
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:07,300
Scott: and the newer versions paranoia XP and actually think there's one newer version that that's crook slightly.

657
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,047
Rym: So here there is in 1984 first edition.

658
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:20,107
Rym: Yeah 1987 second edition 1995 fifth edition Mmm 2004 XP and then 2009 ready to feel old the 25th anniversary edition.

659
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:26,987
Rym: That really that really hits home.

660
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:27,408
Scott: Yeah.

661
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,837
Scott: Well, I mean it's about the same age as we are.

662
00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:31,322
Scott: we were born in 82 It was born in 84.

663
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,868
Scott: So we're slight.

664
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:34,212
Scott: We're two years older than paranoia.

665
00:41:34,313 --> 00:41:34,975
Scott: So I'm older than 25.

666
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:35,818
Scott: So there you go.

667
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:44,220
Scott: But yeah, so paranoia the newest versions like XP has actually three different play modes zap normal and hardcore.

668
00:41:44,523 --> 00:41:48,008
Scott: I don't think that's what the actual names are But I know the first the run version names have.

669
00:41:48,088 --> 00:42:09,200
Scott: basically you can play it in silly mode or a serious mode Which actually is really interesting because it gives the game a lot of depth and it also gives you sort of like this entry point Into the larger world, you know It's like you can play some silly games of paranoia to get into it and learn the basic rules And then once you're comfortable you can start playing a serious game and it's like whoa, what the fuck dude.

670
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:18,960
Rym: Now I think the best way to get into paranoia because a lot of people want to play paranoia But gotta play at a convention You've got to play it at a convention.

671
00:42:19,441 --> 00:42:26,060
Rym: But you have to basically find someone who's running a game of paranoia who is good at it and play in their game.

672
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:29,415
Rym: And it is the less, you know about paranoia the better the better.

673
00:42:29,476 --> 00:42:32,929
Scott: indeed paranoia It's anyone who knows too much about.

674
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:37,460
Scott: it's one of those things where if you know enough about it Then you won't make like stupid newbie mistakes.

675
00:42:37,801 --> 00:42:42,138
Scott: But stupid people making stupid newbie mistakes is where all the humor and awesome shit comes from.

676
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:45,440
Rym: of course Advanced players take it one step further and do the burning wheel.

677
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:48,610
Rym: You know metagaming of I am going to do the.

678
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:54,732
Rym: the stupid thing that my character would think would smart would be smart But I know according to the rules is going to kill him.

679
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,720
Scott: Well, it goes even to a higher level, right?

680
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,247
Scott: For example, let's say you're playing with six newbies, right?

681
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:00,009
Scott: You're the GM.

682
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,273
Scott: You're gonna ask someone.

683
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:02,858
Scott: Are you a happy communist, right?

684
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:10,106
Scott: Oh And they're gonna fall for it maybe and then the computer will zap them and they'll chug down a can of soda and then come back to life.

685
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:14,499
Scott: if You're playing with an experienced player an experienced player wouldn't fall for that trick.

686
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:19,553
Scott: But in addition an experienced player would try to trick the other players, right?

687
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:25,470
Scott: And if you have all experienced players Oh, it's a friggin cutthroat motherfucker at that point.

688
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:28,700
Rym: I mean most games of paranoia are one-offs.

689
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:37,504
Rym: Oftentimes, they'll be pseudo larp style where you'll play around a table But a lot of times you'll have props on the table all these sorts of you know Objects to interact with.

690
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:45,899
Rym: you'll stand up you'll run around you might jump up and sing the bouncy bubbly beverage song You don't know the lyrics to but damn if the computer isn't gonna kill you if you don't sing it.

691
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:54,271
Scott: Yep, and that you're speaking of, you know, the bubbly beverage is already a mentioned soda, but there's a. there's a a Thing in paranoia called the six pack.

692
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,819
Scott: you get six lives and then you're.

693
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:58,091
Scott: you know Your body is just regenerated and such.

694
00:43:58,212 --> 00:43:59,800
Rym: basically you get six clones of yourself.

695
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:07,146
Rym: so every time you know, your clone is popped out and it's you and if you die, they pop out another you and Everyone gets six.

696
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:32,776
Scott: Yeah, and after the sixth one, you're actually dead And so what people often do is you'll have a six-pack of beverage any beverage of your choice wink wink on the table usually something that will make you pee and Every time you die you open one up and you start drinking and when you finish that beverage Then you begin playing again and you are now that is represents your you know Coming back to life and being removed from the cryo chamber, whatever the hell it's in.

697
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:45,000
Scott: right now The thing is drinking all these beverages you're gonna have to pee and when you're away from the table Your character is not away from the table and very likely when you come back from being you will be drinking another beverage immediately.

698
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:56,146
Rym: It's a game where it's one of the first games I ever played where I started to understand that the meta like Metagaming can make a game better.

699
00:44:56,286 --> 00:45:01,363
Rym: It was the game where I realized that losing is more fun than winning Mmm-hmm.

700
00:45:01,644 --> 00:45:03,773
Rym: It's also a game where you're pretty much guaranteed to lose.

701
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:05,219
Scott: Yeah, pretty much event.

702
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,059
Scott: You know, if you play a serious game, you're gonna die a lot less frequently and you're gonna.

703
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:17,347
Scott: you know You're gonna make it a lot farther, but you're gonna die, you know, maybe once per session, you know Maybe once every other session or so.

704
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:25,400
Scott: if you place not so seriously, you're gonna die Lose all six lives within the one session at the convention pretty much guaranteed.

705
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:31,660
Rym: Yeah, I mean basically the way most missions will go or one-offs at a convention are you're a bunch of mugs.

706
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:40,580
Scott: You know red color maybe a higher color doesn't really matter and you're given some task And you the computer says do this and if you don't do that, the computer is just gonna kill you.

707
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:48,076
Rym: So you better do it, but it's something serious like go figure out what's wrong with the the sewage thing over here find out why this guy disappeared or something like that.

708
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:58,600
Rym: and Every character will probably have some completely ulterior mode if they want to accomplish and Oftentimes one of the players will be given by that, you know, there's a lot of secret information and note passing.

709
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:01,378
Rym: So the game master might pass you a note.

710
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:15,454
Rym: You know when the plate game starts up and you just open it and it just says something like You know for a fact that there is a cortex bomb in your skull and in so-and-so skull Great, or you are in fact a communist having read.

711
00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:16,740
Rym: This has made you a communist.

712
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:20,999
Rym: Now smart players will give that note to someone else.

713
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:31,960
Rym: a lot of times Players will like write a note like I totally want to do blah blah blah and blah blah blah and just pull up the note And just hand it to the game master.

714
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:41,560
Rym: a lot of experienced players will write gibberish on a note or Nothing of note on a note or saying I'm running a note to make so-and-so paranoid and hand it to the game master.

715
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:43,720
Scott: Mmm very very clever.

716
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:49,242
Scott: Also a good idea is to hand a note to the game master that says I would like to talk to you privately over to The side.

717
00:46:49,262 --> 00:46:51,453
Scott: go over to the side and say I just wanted to talk.

718
00:46:51,493 --> 00:46:56,310
Scott: you do privately over to the side You know because that makes me even more paranoid than the fake note.

719
00:46:56,771 --> 00:46:58,858
Scott: or you can go over and tell them right.

720
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:03,426
Scott: for example I could bring the game master over and I could say hey listen I'm gonna pass a note to so-and-so.

721
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:07,100
Scott: that makes them a communist so that they something something something.

722
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,676
Scott: So I need you to take advantage of that something something and you hand a note to that person.

723
00:47:10,717 --> 00:47:11,460
Scott: that does nothing different.

724
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,860
Scott: So you can punk the game master - that's always a good time.

725
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,543
Rym: That's the whole.

726
00:47:15,844 --> 00:47:17,372
Rym: that's basically the whole point of the game.

727
00:47:17,392 --> 00:47:24,497
Rym: that and the game master Usually why his job is to make you have a good time and if possible to kill all of you.

728
00:47:24,517 --> 00:47:25,039
Rym: mm-hmm.

729
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,640
Rym: He wants you all to die and have a total party because you have six lives.

730
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:31,187
Scott: It's like undead.

731
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:31,910
Scott: whatever come back.

732
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:32,473
Scott: You know.

733
00:47:32,513 --> 00:47:37,699
Scott: It's not like ah dead in D&D You're gonna kill someone like guard that can or a marty duck.

734
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:39,368
Scott: You know you got six lives.

735
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:51,040
Scott: so as long as you don't lose all six And if you do lose all six as long as you're not the first person who's all six You can just be like god damn it And you just sit off to the side laughing at what everyone else is doing because the game is probably already almost over by then.

736
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:57,980
Scott: Because even if you suck ass six lives is still plenty of game time to get your funds worth out of it.

737
00:47:58,323 --> 00:48:03,690
Scott: You know out of the single session Anything else to say about the paradigm?

738
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:04,132
Rym: I don't know.

739
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:05,620
Rym: I don't want to get into game details.

740
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:10,398
Rym: I would say none of you should read anything, but kind of the intro book.

741
00:48:10,538 --> 00:48:11,060
Scott: Oh, this is true.

742
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,450
Scott: There is there's a thing in paranoid.

743
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:15,706
Scott: depending on what color you are Determines what colors you can interact with.

744
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,000
Scott: for example if there's a blue gun like the gun is physically blue, and I am red.

745
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:21,625
Scott: That's above me.

746
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:22,791
Scott: I can't touch that.

747
00:48:22,952 --> 00:48:24,620
Scott: if I can well you can.

748
00:48:25,162 --> 00:48:32,514
Scott: But if you do and the computer sees you you're probably gonna die and if someone else sees you they're probably gonna rat you out To the computer or kill you or you know.

749
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:34,322
Scott: so It's.

750
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:39,000
Scott: you know you're not supposed to in you know involve yourself with things that are a higher color than you are.

751
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,084
Scott: You know it's like you're.

752
00:48:40,345 --> 00:48:42,031
Scott: you're limited to what color you're at.

753
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:45,443
Scott: if you're playing a serious game and not the silly game You're probably never.

754
00:48:45,463 --> 00:48:49,959
Scott: you're probably going to avoid interacting with anything above you because dying is more serious in a serious game.

755
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:57,960
Scott: so What in the rule book if you buy paranoia XP for example the front part of the book is you know red red red red?

756
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,261
Scott: Red.

757
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:09,589
Scott: and then about halfway through the book the color changes to ultraviolet Which is you know so that only the GM can look back there and if a player looks you know takes the book and flips To one of those back pages.

758
00:49:09,952 --> 00:49:10,658
Scott: dumb dumb dumb.

759
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:26,354
Scott: They actually print a separate book the little red book ha ha ha right that has only the red parts in it For the game so that you can hand that out to people who if you're actually serious about you know the color rules And all and you could you do all sorts of fun stuff with that.

760
00:49:26,394 --> 00:49:29,538
Scott: like someone picks up a pencil That's yellow you like oh, man.

761
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,402
Scott: Or you know you could be like hey red guy the computer tells you to go over to get your orders from the you know Computer.

762
00:49:36,422 --> 00:49:39,172
Scott: it's it's printing out of the printer in sector 7.

763
00:49:39,172 --> 00:49:42,384
Scott: Oh my god Luke Did that you go to this.

764
00:49:42,404 --> 00:49:46,097
Scott: you go to sector 7 and there's a printer and it's printing out some you know.

765
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,986
Scott: and there's a you Know security camera.

766
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:54,399
Scott: looking at the printer and the instructions are coming out And you see that your name is written on the instructions on this purple piece of paper.

767
00:49:55,221 --> 00:50:00,279
Scott: It's just like oh fuck I can't take the orders out of this printer and like half the orders is still in the printer.

768
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,026
Rym: well That's the the propness.

769
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:03,453
Rym: I mean when Luke handed me.

770
00:50:03,473 --> 00:50:04,980
Rym: You know he basically held up his hands.

771
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:10,220
Rym: We played paranoia at RIT around the table, and he kind of spit out the orders to each person like here are your orders?

772
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:19,580
Rym: And then one of us we go up and like I I go to grab it and he holds on to it And he starts pulling it back in like I only got half of them.

773
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,076
Rym: Paranoia is a game where you'll be at a convention and you'll see like some other do you know?

774
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:42,797
Rym: there's all like the tables where People are playing different games like D&D game going on over there Maybe some inspectors over there and in the corner the people playing paranoia look like a normal game Except periodically they will cause a great ruckus in the room and everyone will look over and say what are they doing

775
00:50:42,978 --> 00:50:43,660
Scott: playing paranoia?

776
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,150
Scott: The most ruckus ERPG available.

777
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:48,399
Rym: it is possibly the most ruckus ERPG.

778
00:50:49,302 --> 00:50:54,740
Scott: Yeah, the guy who made paranoia at least one of the guys is a major guys is Greg Kostikin.

779
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,264
Scott: Yeah, sort of very famous.

780
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:56,786
Scott: He tried.

781
00:50:56,986 --> 00:51:00,918
Scott: You know he's actually doing a lot of big stuff now even he has a great blog.

782
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:11,160
Scott: play this Thing I think I've talked about in the show way back and basically you go to this blog And it'll tell you about all sorts of interesting games all the time mostly indie games.

783
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:18,246
Scott: He's big with the indie games, and he actually he started this like indie game thing But he sort of it failed.

784
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:22,180
Scott: I think it was like man if red manifesto or something like that.

785
00:51:22,442 --> 00:51:40,300
Scott: I forget the exact name of the company, but It didn't work out You know because he couldn't compete with say steam and such and such and the indie games got a prominent spot in other online Game selling services, so you know his indie thing only didn't really need to stick around, but you know he's that kind of guy.

786
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:44,053
Scott: he's pretty awesome and You know you should check out anything.

787
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:46,985
Scott: if you see his name on it you know it's probably high quality.

788
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:47,988
Scott: gaming is involved.

789
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:54,149
Rym: plus paranoia definitely comes out of an older tradition of role-playing games.

790
00:51:54,229 --> 00:51:57,702
Scott: his day is definitely Steve Jackson sort of era of Gaming.

791
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,220
Scott: not that he's not gaming now, but you know it's his his original era.

792
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:04,499
Scott: It's a sort of gaming the illuminati versus the munchkin era.

793
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:09,920
Rym: Paranoia is relatively mainstream compared to many more indie role-playing games.

794
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,800
Rym: I mean most people most gamers we talked to don't even know there are any role-playing games.

795
00:52:14,122 --> 00:52:15,369
Scott: Alright, it's D&D.

796
00:52:15,611 --> 00:52:17,079
Scott: Maybe they know a white wolf exists.

797
00:52:17,561 --> 00:52:22,098
Rym: You know that's it, but paranoia just it's over with all the indie games like.

798
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:22,620
Rym: it's unique.

799
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:24,180
Rym: It does something cool and different.

800
00:52:24,862 --> 00:52:30,280
Rym: It's such a great game to play and you should all go to some convention somewhere and play paranoia.

801
