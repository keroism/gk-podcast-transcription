00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,996
Rym: It's Thursday April 22nd.

2
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:12,838
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,249
Rym: I'm Scott talking kind of slow for some reason and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,928
Rym: tonight We're going to talk about living in the city.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,626
Rym: Definite article.

6
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:25,418
Rym: let's do this.

7
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:37,180
Scott: So Rym you say you got some sort of meta Open e bit that pertains to your life in some way jackass.

8
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:42,170
Rym: We sat here for like five minutes with no open e bit, and then I'm like all right I'll do this thing for my life.

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,320
Rym: That's boring, but we'll just fill it out.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,626
Rym: You're like no no no I got something.

11
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:45,208
Scott: what the fuck?

12
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,358
Scott: yeah, that's all I had and you know what.

13
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:49,311
Scott: in fact we even discussed how.

14
00:00:49,694 --> 00:01:00,044
Scott: I you know cuz We basically had a cascade of meta meta meta where I was like oh well actually let's talk about how I came up with this Open e bit.

15
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:02,020
Scott: that was actually just an intro to your open e bit.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,980
Scott: Decided to do that meta.

17
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:06,727
Scott: We then that meta thought.

18
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:14,334
Scott: we decided to bring that meta thought onto the show which was the double meta But then it was a cascade of metaness by pre meditating them.

19
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:14,956
Rym: I don't even know.

20
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:16,040
Rym: I don't know what happened here.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,565
Scott: pre meditated double meta Open e bit.

22
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:27,240
Scott: the funny thing is that hopefully better than you know the open e bit itself And maybe it will make up for the complete lack of a good open e bit.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,742
Rym: There's even.

24
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:35,218
Rym: well, I can't get into the reasons for this, but there's a fourth meta that we didn't bring up yet As to why we just did what we just did.

25
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:39,036
Rym: Anyway, I do have an open e bit, but it is totally lame.

26
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:42,199
Rym: so Actually forgot it, so let's just get right into this.

27
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:45,965
Scott: It was a meta.

28
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:50,160
Scott: cascade overflowed your brain and then see cuz you were storing it in the stack.

29
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:53,792
Scott: But I totally overflowed the heap and you didn't deallocate.

30
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:56,360
Scott: so I over wrote the stack and then there was override.

31
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:57,264
Rym: Yeah, it didn't.

32
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,420
Rym: the thing is at least you didn't execute any code elsewhere.

33
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,020
Scott: It's not like I just suddenly pooped myself and actually if anyone wants to come in like you know write me an email about like.

34
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:12,980
Scott: No, you actually would overwrite the stack to get into the heat shut up right.

35
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:22,270
Rym: So this I wouldn't normally talk about this sort of thing because it's happened before quite good God and I have to talk about it though because I was.

36
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:33,356
Rym: I can't believe this is still an issue And I can't believe that basically the exact same course of events has happened again South Park as you all know episode 200. you know they were building up to it there.

37
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:34,560
Scott: 200 amazing genius work.

38
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,187
Scott: You know work of genius brilliant.

39
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,377
Rym: I love South Park Scott love South Park.

40
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:38,960
Rym: It's it's the thing.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,246
Rym: We don't talk about it on the show.

42
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,191
Rym: I'm in order gonna say hey.

43
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:42,276
Rym: I like that show hey.

44
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:42,919
Rym: I like it, too.

45
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:46,040
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I guess we could review it the same way we review.

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,328
Scott: Well, maybe you know I think I don't know.

47
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:54,949
Scott: we should definitely shouldn't review or talk about any of these kinds of things at length But I think at the very least we need to you know.

48
00:02:55,009 --> 00:03:03,996
Scott: mention them quickly in passing more often because people seem to think that Like people seem to either think a we watch all that stupid geeky shit that everyone else watches.

49
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:09,920
Scott: That's completely retarded and Vapid or people think we don't watch anything at all.

50
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:16,420
Rym: I will admit the only vapid thing that I watch it all right now is Glee, and I don't even like it that much.

51
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:19,192
Scott: I don't watch any of that shit.

52
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:25,240
Rym: I want South Park and You don't even watch Archer, which I think you should some animes.

53
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:30,480
Rym: I watch one Archer and South Park, and I actually still watch the Simpsons.

54
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:35,340
Scott: I don't watch it regularly, but like if you turned it on I wouldn't be like so you really?

55
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:37,569
Rym: There's a recent one where they go to Israel.

56
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:38,412
Rym: No shit.

57
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,239
Rym: It's it's not that great.

58
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:42,574
Rym: The jokes are kind of the obvious ones.

59
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:43,299
Scott: yeah.

60
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:50,237
Rym: So South Park you know once showed Muhammad and then showed Muhammad again and no one had any problem.

61
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:53,878
Rym: and then they wanted to show Muhammad another time, and they weren't allowed to.

62
00:03:53,898 --> 00:04:10,359
Rym: and Now for the 200th episode they basically did this whole meta thing of bringing everything back about South Park except Muhammad and Straight up pointing out how stupid it is that Comedy Central won't let them show Muhammad on the show

63
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:11,122
Scott: Mm-hmm,

64
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,375
Rym: and they did not actually show Muhammad, but they did this great thing.

65
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:15,580
Scott: actually have a feeling right.

66
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:16,800
Scott: This is one of those situations.

67
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,988
Scott: It's not Comedy Central like if you.

68
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:24,068
Scott: just if Comedy Central was like you know broken off into its own deal It would be probably be cool.

69
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:27,323
Scott: I think it's probably Viacom Executive.

70
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:30,575
Scott: probably you know cuz I don't know what the hierarchy is like over there.

71
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:34,850
Scott: It might be one in the same I'm not sure, but that's that's the feeling you get right.

72
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,017
Scott: like a Comedy Central person wouldn't be a dick.

73
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,342
Scott: a Viacom person Would be it.

74
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:42,079
Rym: then again look at the majority of the programming on Comedy Central.

75
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:44,447
Rym: It's not all South Park.

76
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:51,860
Scott: Well look at the majority of programming on Anything cable television yeah, and then the people were anyway.

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,028
Rym: So the episode.

78
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,060
Rym: they get to the point where they're basically like well Is it okay if we just kind of put him like in a box?

79
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,319
Rym: You don't see him you just see the box.

80
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:02,939
Rym: What if we put a mask on him?

81
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,009
Rym: What if we just say you know all that kind of stuff?

82
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,100
Rym: it was good, and it made its point very very well.

83
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:08,333
Scott: They also you know.

84
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:14,180
Scott: the key point They made was like look we're not doing something because someone is threatening violence against us if we do it.

85
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,265
Scott: So then they're like.

86
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:18,520
Scott: they bring up the question what if someone also threatened us with violence?

87
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:20,428
Scott: You know to make us do it.

88
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:21,152
Scott: We know who would.

89
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:21,917
Scott: what do you do then?

90
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:22,017
Scott: well?

91
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:31,353
Rym: If you're if you're violence either way if you're reading Japanese political manga the answer is you threaten someone with violence If they do the thing they were gonna do other anyway.

92
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:35,194
Rym: because then if they do it It looks like you won, and if they don't do it you stop them.

93
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:38,988
Rym: yep I learned that from Eagle and sanctuary.

94
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:51,179
Rym: that is a key key strategy especially in a board game, but the episode was great and Comedy Central you know they did do the second half of this episode, and they bleeped everything out at the last minute.

95
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:55,277
Rym: And now they took the episode down from the online streaming.

96
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:58,411
Scott: well Usually take things down for the online streaming.

97
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:00,140
Rym: no no, but they took it down down.

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,388
Rym: It doesn't say you know pre-contractual or whatever.

99
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,219
Rym: it says this long little rant about.

100
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:11,200
Rym: you know We didn't want to take it down, and I quote we apologize that South Park Studios cannot stream episode 201 at this time.

101
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:18,040
Rym: After we delivered the show and I'm gonna go broadcast Comedy Central plays numerous additional audio bleeps throughout the episode.

102
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:22,837
Rym: We do not have network approval to stream our original version of the show mm-hmm.

103
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:23,520
Rym: That's the end of that.

104
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:30,425
Scott: Well let me go on the bit Torrance here, huh, let's see 201. ooh HDTV.

105
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:31,749
Scott: how many seeds are there?

106
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,716
Scott: wow this must be the right one because it has right.

107
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:42,727
Scott: guess the number of seeds 20,402 and there's that's.

108
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:44,010
Scott: wait there are six Torrance.

109
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:45,534
Scott: That's only one of them right?

110
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:49,125
Scott: so it's season 14 episode 6 right That's the one I want.

111
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,470
Rym: yes click.

112
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:52,597
Scott: I'll download it here with your files.

113
00:06:52,898 --> 00:06:53,360
Rym: That's fine.

114
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:54,990
Rym: I will start downloading.

115
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,936
Rym:  that's two more seeds.

116
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,460
Rym: yep.

117
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:05,758
Rym: So I don't think they even sir show Muhammad in the second episode and The scariest part is that the whole point of the episode was all right.

118
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:09,700
Rym: look We're gonna put him in a bear costume and have him barely talk.

119
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,674
Rym: There is no actual visual representation of Muhammad at any point in this episode.

120
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:16,138
Rym: is that okay?

121
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:23,020
Rym: and in the show They're like yes, that is okay, and they got threatened anyway in the real world it wasn't threatened.

122
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,645
Scott: It was a warning right at least for the one that I read.

123
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:36,096
Scott: right was basically there was some group of non You know crazy Islamists or Muslims or whatever and they said look right?

124
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:44,951
Scott: We're not threatening you We're not gonna come and blow you up, but we're warning you that someone else is but that's that's Manna That it's almost as you know.

125
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:46,180
Rym: that's the nice army you have here.

126
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,054
Rym: It's a shame if anything were to say happen to it.

127
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:50,300
Scott: so this torrent isn't working.

128
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:51,826
Rym: Maybe there's trouble.

129
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:52,349
Rym: you know what.

130
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:52,933
Rym: you know what.

131
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:53,879
Rym: I'm so sad.

132
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,540
Scott: Maybe it's cuz I'm using this weird Ubuntu torrent.

133
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:00,354
Rym: I wanted to watch my South Park and that the opening theme even played.

134
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:06,859
Rym: you get you know five minutes into that shit Then out of nowhere Rick roll If only.

135
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,185
Rym: So I don't know.

136
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:10,029
Rym: I don't really.

137
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:12,520
Rym: I mean everything that could be said about this can be said.

138
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:22,452
Rym: I just think this whole idea that We're going to give up our free speech on one thing because a bunch of people have threatened violence about it And I mean the episode shows Buddha smoking crack and yet.

139
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:28,149
Rym: They're not allowed to show Muhammad standing there saying hi Yeah, well there's not really much to discuss.

140
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:37,840
Scott: It's all incredibly obvious stuff, and it's just You know network people Is that one remember way back in the day?

141
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:50,636
Rym: How there was that you know save internet free speech banner campaign the blue ribbon, maybe we need a Muhammad's head campaign The exact same thing just a little banner with a happy Muhammad being like hey, I don't know.

142
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:54,767
Rym: hey everybody Sure, I don't know.

143
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,580
Rym: that's the best I could come up with on this Thursday.

144
00:08:57,782 --> 00:08:59,680
Rym: So what do you have on this Thursday?

145
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,128
Scott: Well, you know usually it's like we try to save.

146
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:06,746
Scott: you know like tech anime and gaming things their respective days But you know what today.

147
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:13,111
Scott: I want to bring in like a little bit of everything, so I'm bringing in a tech news Because there'll probably be a better tech news on Monday right?

148
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:22,821
Scott: so this tech news is that Ubuntu Ubuntu version 1004 which is number 1004 because it's you know 2010 in April right.

149
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:23,965
Scott: so it's 10 for 10 2010 and 4 for April.

150
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:31,032
Scott: In seven days will be released now.

151
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:32,357
Scott: This is important for two reasons.

152
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,886
Scott: number one reason It is an LTS release.

153
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:38,980
Scott: that means that this release will be supported for like five years.

154
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:43,722
Scott: So you can install this and just not upgrade it for like fuck ever You know.

155
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:49,097
Scott: so if you want to like put Ubuntu on your parents computer or on your server or anything like.

156
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:49,960
Rym: you're working a company.

157
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,348
Rym: That's pretty much the best reason.

158
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:52,716
Rym: you're using these in an office.

159
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:57,145
Scott: you want the LTS Yeah, so use this one and it's gonna have all updated stuff And it's gonna.

160
00:09:57,165 --> 00:09:59,100
Scott: you won't have to upgrade it for a long time.

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,250
Scott: You can just update and not upgrade which is a big difference right.

162
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:08,652
Scott: and the other thing is they've changed a lot of the UI Stuff if you are using the GUI parts at least the default GUI parts.

163
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:10,579
Scott: There's a lot more purple going on.

164
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:11,584
Scott: There's a lot more.

165
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,819
Scott: You know all the UI elements are like much brown.

166
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:19,475
Scott: The icons are still seem to be the same orange icons, which I think is weird.

167
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:20,800
Scott: It's like why didn't they change the eye?

168
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:24,971
Rym: I do not like the orange and brown of Ubuntu.

169
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,416
Rym: I get that.

170
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,259
Rym: That's what they like.

171
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:27,620
Rym: I get that.

172
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,282
Rym: That's what now.

173
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,205
Scott: It's all like.

174
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:29,868
Scott: it's weird.

175
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:32,517
Scott: It's like this whole purple and gray and orange.

176
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,107
Rym: That brown shit is still coming in.

177
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:37,793
Scott: it's all whatever.

178
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:39,759
Rym: just it looks so bad.

179
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:45,620
Rym: I The blues and the purples and the blacks tend to I think make cleaner looking interfaces.

180
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:54,880
Rym: Yeah, well, you know like light brown or pastel colors anything like that I want cold hard like light on dark representations of everything.

181
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:56,060
Rym: anyway.

182
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:59,528
Scott: Yeah, that's just how they do what.

183
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:01,836
Scott: nothing you can really do about it, but anyway.

184
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,000
Scott: Yeah, there's a new Ubuntu.

185
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:04,260
Scott: It's gonna be pretty high.

186
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:14,343
Scott: It's gonna be high quality and even if you don't like how the GUI looks you know you can change it because it's not OS X. you can change things and So you should pay attention to that shit.

187
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:27,939
Rym: so things of the day This is a cross between the Batmobile and Roger Smith's car.

188
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,017
Rym: What and if this car were available in the real world now with modern engine and modern stuff inside of it?

189
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:35,057
Rym: I?

190
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:37,364
Rym: Have to give up on the.

191
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:48,327
Rym: I want a tiny little car plan and get the Phantom Corsair somehow, I don't think a 1938 car is gonna work very well.

192
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:50,175
Rym: the thing is it was actually very aerodynamic.

193
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:51,139
Rym: it performed really well.

194
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:51,821
Rym: It was.

195
00:11:51,961 --> 00:12:06,894
Rym: it was a prototype car made by rust Heinz Probably not the best name of a manufacturer of cars But it is the baddest ass looking car of that style I've ever seen because it's a real car, and it's freaking awesome.

196
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:17,195
Rym: It cost apparently about $300,000 equivalent to today's money back then to produce one of them Mm-hmm and they were gonna sell it for about half that.

197
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:20,206
Rym: but what I've got for you Is this this car actually has a weird history.

198
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:34,308
Rym: it was in fact called the Flying Wombat in a movie Back then called the young in heart in 1938. so they used the prototype car in this movie But rather than using the movie as marketing for the car.

199
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:36,736
Rym: They just called it something different in the movie.

200
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:37,538
Rym: Mm-hmm.

201
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,060
Rym: It's weird.

202
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,350
Rym: It's kind of a that wouldn't happen that way in the modern world.

203
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:48,590
Rym: also this old movie gets points for having the most ridiculous Like projection screen driving scenes I've ever seen.

204
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:52,120
Rym: we really take the way movies look today for granted when you look at this whole shit.

205
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:56,685
Rym: Yeah, I kind of watch this movie though Has some weird carded.

206
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:58,952
Rym: I also have the movie looks good on Herbie.

207
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:01,919
Rym: also Herbie not so good But this good.

208
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,300
Rym: Okay, seriously watch this clip, and I think you will agree this looks like a pretty good movie.

209
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,980
Rym: It's not a bunch of con men and they con an old lady and the cars involved and it's good stuff.

210
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:19,760
Rym: I also have a video of the actual 1938 Phantom Corsair driving around Mm-hmm at a show and it sounds pretty damn impressive.

211
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:21,887
Rym: Okay, I don't know.

212
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:22,712
Rym: It's a cool story.

213
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:23,900
Rym: I found all this stuff.

214
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,893
Rym: I found this whole like weird story about the movie.

215
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:54,120
Rym: actually I don't want to get into it But if you look at the movie There was a famous actress who was on the stage not in cinema And there is no video of her ever performing to fight despite her being crazily popular and famous back in the day Except she auditioned and did a screen test for the movie that has the flying wombat Aka the Phantom Corsair in it and because they found that screen test we actually have a video of this famous actress.

216
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:55,765
Scott: Uh-huh, so there's.

217
00:13:55,786 --> 00:14:04,460
Rym: it is proof that if you pick almost any thread in the world no matter what it is And you follow it you can find interesting stuff in almost every direction a long way out.

218
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,307
Scott: I don't think you'll find any interesting stuff.

219
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:17,629
Rym: If you read if you read what about about Oh By the way that South Park was done before the thing of the day.

220
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,252
Rym: music stops.

221
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,400
Scott: Yeah, all right anyway.

222
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:22,484
Rym: So I saved you there.

223
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:25,354
Rym: you didn't have anything and then I cut you off by saying something related.

224
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:38,448
Scott: like it was prompted like I My thing of the day here right I used a Technology news on Thursday, so I'll use a gaming thing of the day Talking about some dwarf fortress here.

225
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:48,860
Rym: door door door you may recall new listeners We did a panel that was basically the dwarf fortress panel And we also did an interview with the creator of dwarf fortress on this very show.

226
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,092
Scott: But anyway dwarf fortress you know the thing that's great about.

227
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:53,778
Rym: I believe it's pronounced dwarf right.

228
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,888
Scott: the thing That's great about this game is mostly.

229
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:59,443
Scott: You know the stories that emerge From.

230
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:01,500
Scott: you know the the game itself.

231
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:08,399
Scott: You know afterwards you know someone will play a bunch of dwarf fortress, and then when they're all done They will you know tell an epic tale of what happened.

232
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:17,368
Scott: And you know to watch it unfold in the game is not nearly as epic as you know when the imagination is applied To the to the raw structure.

233
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:21,360
Rym: the dwarves dug too deep into a den of magma as demons.

234
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:28,813
Scott: So this guy was brutal this guy in this forum here the NZ fortress Forum which looks like a team fortress 2 forum.

235
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:32,066
Rym: Oh, that's what you're doing What I know what I know what you think.

236
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:32,647
Rym: the day is now.

237
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,636
Rym: Oh, it has been revealed to me by meta information.

238
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:43,880
Scott: Uh-huh so Basically what he did is he played some dwarf fortress right and he wrote you know an epic tale of what happened.

239
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:52,639
Scott: He made a little report as you're supposed to do you know so that the people out well you know elsewhere in the world can sort of you know hear your epic tale of dwarfness.

240
00:15:52,659 --> 00:16:02,600
Scott: and Because you know screenshots from the game aren't really you know easy to understand for normal people Especially in a team fortress forum as opposed to a dwarf fortress forum.

241
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,650
Scott: He illustrated it in a children's book style, and he has some pretty good art skills And he has some good Photoshop skills.

242
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:12,031
Scott: I guess to go with his art skills I guess they're one in the same.

243
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:17,140
Scott: and He tells a very good story of what happened to in his dwarf fortress game.

244
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,971
Scott: And let me say his story is quite the epicness.

245
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:24,714
Scott: It is one of the highest quality dwarf fortress stories I have read.

246
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:32,238
Rym: so Now be warned if you think this is awesome you might think maybe I should play door fortress to have my dwarfs.

247
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:34,366
Rym: do Dorothy things And then tell my own story.

248
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,275
Scott: go for it go for it.

249
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:36,737
Scott: You go.

250
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:38,209
Scott: Good luck Everyone.

251
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,179
Rym: you should try it once.

252
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:41,550
Rym: It's one of those things you've got to see like.

253
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,326
Rym: you have to see it with your own eyes to realize What it really is.

254
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:54,657
Scott: yes, but I behold I present to you the story of Bronze murder the fortress of bronze murder versus the monster.

255
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:55,560
Scott: a guess Russia's.

256
00:16:57,382 --> 00:17:09,346
Rym: So right before we get into the main bit we have to do the meta Moment which normally Scott reminds me just before we skip to the second half of the show says hey Don't forget the meta moment, and I say don't remind me I always remember that I do it.

257
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:12,398
Rym: and then last show he didn't remind me, and I totally didn't fucking do it.

258
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:14,459
Rym: So here we are not a moment.

259
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,480
Scott: Do we have any metaness at all?

260
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:21,029
Scott: Yeah, this cosmos is still the book club book.

261
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,353
Scott: I still don't have a copy.

262
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,499
Scott: Rym still hasn't finished reading his copy.

263
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,228
Scott: I Can't even find a soft cover on Amazon.

264
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:28,152
Scott: They're all hardcovers.

265
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:29,760
Rym: dude the strand.

266
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:32,110
Scott: I'm probably gonna head yeah, but I have to go down there.

267
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,014
Scott: Yeah.

268
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:35,567
Rym: Yeah go this weekend We got people coming out anyway.

269
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,520
Rym: Yeah, maybe we'll take the whole crew to the Strand.

270
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:41,792
Rym: It's a lot of going and then we'll ditch him there and go back to our place and see if they can find their way back.

271
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:45,767
Scott: Yeah, but what other men in this do?

272
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:46,972
Scott: we have convention season.

273
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:47,614
Scott: It's a lull.

274
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,240
Scott: There's no conventions until July.

275
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:58,460
Scott: It's still April so you got you know a couple months off here with nothing doing and I guess you should you know go to our website.

276
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:01,517
Scott: You know cuz a lot of people who listen to us don't do that front row.

277
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:01,658
Scott: calm.

278
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:11,926
Rym: I'll say straight up though where I'm not going to announce what yet But we are definitely doing panels and other things at PAX prawn, so we will be there But we don't have a schedule or anything yet.

279
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:12,408
Rym: Obviously.

280
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:14,356
Scott: It's a little it's a little early temper.

281
00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:15,280
Scott: That's a little ways out.

282
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:16,139
Scott: Let's worry about the July.

283
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:19,409
Rym: This is what I gotta get into fucking Otakon.

284
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,733
Rym: Which is in August.

285
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,220
Scott: I thought it's in July dad late July whatever.

286
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:24,984
Rym: No schedule yet.

287
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,608
Rym: No no plans.

288
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:26,989
Rym: We didn't.

289
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,239
Rym: we started like going over panels with Otakon.

290
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:39,248
Rym: yet Meanwhile ConnectiCon which we're doing panels for we're gonna have a penciled in schedule done you know within a matter of days and Pax prime which is in September.

291
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,975
Rym: We're already talking schedule.

292
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:45,790
Rym: Yep, I Don't know if I can deal with these unprofessional cons anymore.

293
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:55,155
Scott: I don't know either, but you know We've gone to Otakon like how many years in a row Not to go, but it's like if they can't step up the game.

294
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:55,979
Scott: What am I supposed to do?

295
00:18:56,722 --> 00:18:57,766
Scott: And I don't even have a car.

296
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:00,820
Scott: so it's like going to Baltimore is a bigger pain in the ass than it ever was before.

297
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:10,190
Scott: At least I'm gonna go through all that hassle for at least anime Boston is the fan con that is still treating us Professionally yeah, and it's much easier to get to than Baltimore.

298
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,017
Rym: Yeah flying to Boston's cheaper than Amtrak into Boston.

299
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:13,719
Scott: I know right.

300
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:13,779
Scott: ah.

301
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:20,349
Scott: So without further ado Yeah, so I guess we're gonna do an episode.

302
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,700
Rym: this was suggested by two independent listeners.

303
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:27,814
Rym: I don't know if you colluded or what but yeah people have been asking us What it's like or what's different.

304
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,800
Rym: now that we live in the city They want us to do a show on something about living in the city.

305
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,749
Rym: You know definite article city as in New York City.

306
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:38,700
Scott: Yeah, personally, you know, I'm like and it's sort of a bleh episode.

307
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:40,200
Scott: It's gonna really be that good.

308
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:47,371
Scott: But you know what I figure at least once right people there are certain episodes people keep asking for and we keep saying no No, no, that's a really stupid episode.

309
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:48,195
Scott: It's not gonna be good.

310
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:49,100
Scott: We don't have a lot to say.

311
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,328
Scott: We have some reason that that's a bad episode.

312
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:53,415
Scott: So, you know what, you know, you you know.

313
00:19:53,435 --> 00:20:00,654
Scott: the listener requests usually You know are not the greatest Jackass is always asked for food episodes.

314
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:01,860
Rym: the food episodes.

315
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:08,236
Rym: The thing is I don't count zombie requests as actual requests because they know we're never gonna do it.

316
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,587
Rym: Okay, they know Now they know.

317
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:17,468
Scott: but anyway, you know, so let's Let's for once let us oblige right?

318
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:20,599
Scott: We'll do the what the listeners want and it's okay because this is not a.

319
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:21,985
Rym: Here's the trouble.

320
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,137
Rym: here is the problem with what you just stop.

321
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:24,640
Scott: it's the tea.

322
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,551
Scott: It's a tribes to mistake right the one we always complain about.

323
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:32,879
Rym: if this is a popular episode We've basically just shot ourselves in the foot.

324
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,160
Rym: now We're gonna have to start doing all the thing is right.

325
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,416
Scott: No, cuz the thing is like look if it's a popular episode among the listeners.

326
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:41,102
Scott: That doesn't mean shit It's only.

327
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:45,578
Scott: it only will prove to be a popular episode if it brings in a whole bunch of people we never saw before.

328
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:47,588
Scott: then Well have to keep doing.

329
00:20:47,688 --> 00:21:01,279
Rym: I would argue that is a false dichotomy because the only Kinds of episodes that would bring in people in large quantities are the ones that have some independent of the quality of the show External appeal for the subject matter in the title alone.

330
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,407
Rym: But yeah, so could link to.

331
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,898
Scott: couldn't this have some?

332
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,160
Scott: you know Some people could be how many people are interested in like learning about what it's like.

333
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,820
Rym: But for example the masturbation episode brought a lot of people in because it was kind of weird and it got the word out there.

334
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,607
Rym: But a topic that might even it.

335
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,870
Rym: the problem is what if it's a good show that just doesn't bring in new people But is popular know what?

336
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,560
Scott: we will need some evaluation.

337
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:25,874
Rym: I just don't want to set a precedent for people to say well that episode was popular.

338
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:27,520
Rym: Why did you my episode on burritos?

339
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,147
Scott: Yeah, like you I think.

340
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:34,770
Rym: actually though the reason we should do this is that and we'll stop the meta minute in a second This is still all meta.

341
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,425
Rym: It's been the meta show Mm-hmm is that?

342
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:46,840
Rym: very often Scott and I will both say something like yeah, we don't have anything to say about this topic But then it'll be go time in the South Park style the terrain Parker style.

343
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:51,600
Rym: We won't have any episode better than the crab people crap episode that we came up with.

344
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:58,179
Rym: So we'll do the crab people and it'll be just fine because we suddenly have emerging conversation.

345
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,488
Scott: Anyway, so living in New York City.

346
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:01,990
Scott: We've been here.

347
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,980
Scott: What how many months I've been here since December basically.

348
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:08,880
Scott: So four months and change here earlier than that like November October.

349
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,790
Rym: The thing I really have to say is that I did.

350
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,080
Scott: I paid a month of rent where I was basically going back and forth.

351
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,864
Scott: Yeah, then I was here for reals.

352
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:17,749
Rym: I mean I can summarize it pretty straight out.

353
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:33,661
Rym: I now looking back on Rym from six months ago cannot even imagine a time in my life where I even Considered the possibility of not living in the middle of the biggest city in the world Well the greatest city in the world the city Like.

354
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:39,240
Rym: I can't imagine that I actually wanted to buy a house outside of the city that I even considered it.

355
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:44,880
Rym: That's the fact that I put down 20 grand to buy that house like it shocks me.

356
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:50,384
Rym: I I'm so glad that that deal fell through I I would have.

357
00:22:50,444 --> 00:22:55,257
Rym: the thing is I don't know if I would have regretted it because if I'd gotten the house I never would have moved here I wouldn't have known.

358
00:22:55,902 --> 00:23:01,078
Scott: You would have known because you came down to my apartment and that's when you were like, oh shit Scott knows Got smarter than me.

359
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:01,291
Scott: Yeah

360
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:12,850
Rym: Because Scott did move to the city first and I was gonna buy the house and the plan was to put like a studio Upstate for doing video and all this all the GeekNights plans we had and make it kind of the center of the front row crew.

361
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,110
Rym: and then Emily and I just stayed at Scott's apartment one night and Suddenly it clicked that wait a minute.

362
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:21,405
Rym: I Have like a 15-minute commute now.

363
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:24,192
Rym: Yeah, I can do stuff in the city.

364
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:24,674
Scott: Yep.

365
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:27,000
Rym: It's not that much more expensive.

366
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:28,908
Rym: Nope that was the kicker.

367
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:31,880
Rym: it is not that much more expensive to live in the city.

368
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,173
Scott: Yeah, people look at people look at the city rents, right?

369
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,380
Scott: Okay, so check this out, right?

370
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,467
Scott: I was living upstate.

371
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:37,416
Scott: the rent for the.

372
00:23:37,678 --> 00:23:47,080
Scott: you know It was like a big apartment like it had a living room and a kitchen and a hallway two floors two floors Two bedrooms too bad, you know, it's big two decks.

373
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:51,040
Rym: I mean by the bedroom was enough for two like king-sized beds.

374
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,336
Scott: It was a lot of space in this thing, but the rent was 1200 and there were two people.

375
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:56,340
Scott: so it was 600.

376
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,044
Scott: That's a low rent.

377
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:58,693
Rym: Yep, 600 bucks a month.

378
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,000
Scott: That's that's a low rent.

379
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,720
Scott: So now right my city rent in Astoria.

380
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:07,280
Scott: So I got to take the subway to get into the city or ride my bike, right and it's not like in Manhattan.

381
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:11,321
Scott: It's you know, it's on the across the river, but it's not like, you know, it's it's still New York City It's.

382
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:14,155
Scott: it takes me like, you know, 15 minutes to get to work.

383
00:24:14,215 --> 00:24:14,879
Scott: It's not a big deal.

384
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:21,293
Scott: The rent is I have one bedroom one living room one bathroom.

385
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:23,398
Scott: The kitchen is sort of part of the living room.

386
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,165
Scott: ish I have a little balcony.

387
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,231
Scott: I got some windows.

388
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:28,100
Scott: It's nice and modern and everything.

389
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,607
Scott: It is an elevator and I'm on the third floor and it's pretty nice, but the rent is 1500 And that's just one person rent.

390
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:38,660
Scott: So alright, so it is more than double rent, but that's only on the surface.

391
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,808
Rym: You think alright more than double rent, but for a lot less space, but living upstate We had almost $400 a month in the train.

392
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:49,272
Scott: Yep, the train ticket, right?

393
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:52,109
Scott: It was like 400 something $400 a person.

394
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:58,900
Scott: and then if you didn't live near, you know If you didn't work near Grand Central, you had to also pay 80 for the unlimited Metro card.

395
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,340
Rym: So you're pushing almost 500 bucks extra on just for commuting on top of the New York All right.

396
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,495
Scott: So now the upstate cost of living is like 1100 versus the 1500 rent in the city.

397
00:25:08,922 --> 00:25:17,160
Rym: So I thought to myself would I pay $400 a month to be able to teleport to working back rather than taking this train?

398
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:20,494
Rym: And then I realized that well I might as well move into the city.

399
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:21,620
Rym: it's the ATM conundrum.

400
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,543
Scott: But I mean there's more.

401
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:28,223
Scott: there's even more financial things to consider like well, I won't have any car at all period I'll just get rid of it.

402
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:30,933
Scott: So that saves even more money.

403
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:31,454
Scott: Yeah.

404
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:36,039
Rym: Well, well that's saving me $11 a month in insurance.

405
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:40,191
Scott: It saved me a lot more than that.

406
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:41,480
Rym: Well, you're a nicer car.

407
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,422
Scott: Yeah, but you know, there's also other things like okay the food in the city is more expensive But not that much more it's still.

408
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:49,546
Scott: it's a lot more expensive.

409
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:53,279
Scott: a yogurt and in a normal grocery store outside of New York City is like 20 cents.

410
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:55,628
Scott: a Yogurt anywhere in New York City is a dollar.

411
00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:58,640
Scott: So it's like, you know, you're spending all the prices are much higher.

412
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,180
Scott: But the thing is when we were upstate, you know the drive to the grocery stores.

413
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:10,959
Scott: you'd pay for gas and then you would buy all this food of the grocery store because you couldn't really go there that often and then Most of that food like wouldn't get eaten because you bought too much.

414
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:16,880
Scott: I can stop I can walk to the grocery store and get exactly the amount of food that I need at any moment in time.

415
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:19,167
Scott: So I'm not buying any excess food.

416
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:28,056
Scott: So it actually the money I've been calculating because I keep track of this sort of thing I'm actually making out because I'm buying a lot less food, but I'm eating pretty much 99% of it.

417
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,507
Scott: I hardly throw out any foods that isn't?

418
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:34,256
Scott: you know, that's actually went bad or anything like that.

419
00:26:34,557 --> 00:26:36,283
Rym: Yeah, and even better I mean where I am.

420
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:43,820
Rym: I actually use fresh direct so I don't have to go outside for anything I purchase in the entire world except some clothes.

421
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,798
Scott: Yeah, and the savings in time is just off the charts in terms of things that I can do.

422
00:26:48,818 --> 00:26:55,900
Rym: course It's amazing how quickly things go from amazing to taken for granted to still not perfect.

423
00:26:56,722 --> 00:27:04,764
Rym: Emily and I do could not find the time last week to order our fucking groceries Online.

424
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:06,449
Scott: Yeah, I don't have this problem.

425
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:11,363
Rym: I couldn't be asked to just log out of the website and click on Order the same thing.

426
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:16,560
Rym: I ordered two weeks ago and have it brought into my apartment and put in my fridge for me by people?

427
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:17,948
Scott: Yeah, this is this is a problem.

428
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:18,511
Scott: I do not have.

429
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:22,325
Rym: well, I live a much more Life lately right.

430
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:29,633
Rym: but the crazy thing is, you know Scott by himself Emily and I moved You know got the place together and our rent is double Scott.

431
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:31,058
Rym: So it's about three thousand dollars a month.

432
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:39,147
Rym: but if the two of us moving into the city means we're saving about a $1,000 a month in train and metro card.

433
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:43,480
Scott: Well, it gives us two people times, you know, so it's $800 in train tickets.

434
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,067
Rym: Yeah, plus all the associated fees.

435
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:49,965
Rym: We both had cars upstate that we got rid of and Basically dividing it all up.

436
00:27:50,548 --> 00:27:53,118
Rym: It is way cheaper than that mortgage was gonna be.

437
00:27:54,564 --> 00:27:57,496
Scott: Well, there's all those, you know added fees on the mortgage and things like that.

438
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:01,192
Rym: You don't even realize I took all those into account the property taxes and all that.

439
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:02,959
Scott: but there's also the New York City tax.

440
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:03,923
Rym: Yeah, I did.

441
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:08,720
Rym: I did not worry about the New York City tax yet because my taxes are going up rapidly anyway.

442
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:10,868
Rym: Yeah, fucking capital gains taxes.

443
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:12,715
Rym: I still can't figure out how they work.

444
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:18,960
Scott: I know it's weird Like I thought you know, I calculated, you know before I came to the city and it's like, you know the calculations.

445
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:23,317
Scott: It was like, you know, I was trying to be all you know, I wasn't you know, a hundred percent like.

446
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:29,100
Scott: okay I was trying to be conservative and then you know, I'm conservative and I was like, oh man, there's plenty of money.

447
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,364
Scott: Oh, man, there's not enough money.

448
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:31,849
Scott: Uh, be realistic.

449
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:32,731
Scott: There's not enough money.

450
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:35,440
Scott: Oh, you're gonna have less extra, you know profits.

451
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,083
Rym: There's plenty of you.

452
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:38,348
Scott: profits are fine.

453
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:39,151
Scott: It's all good.

454
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:40,435
Scott: Money's not an issue.

455
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:41,760
Scott: It's it's fine.

456
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,240
Rym: Yeah, but I think what we should do is I we should not skip a little bit of the personal experience like this.

457
00:28:47,400 --> 00:29:00,811
Rym: And I just want to get into kind of the things about this living in the city that are great or that are just different That I guess someone who hasn't lived in the city or just someone who's thinking like living in the city or a city Wouldn't realize or like things you just wouldn't think about.

458
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:02,257
Scott: it's pretty much only two things right.

459
00:29:02,297 --> 00:29:05,051
Scott: number one Tourists need to all die.

460
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:08,636
Scott: Jesus Christ people Walk, don't just stop.

461
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:18,420
Scott: Whoa, Disney World right is a place where there are tourists But those tourists pretty much just stay in Disney World and there aren't any non tourists in Disney World except for Disney World employees.

462
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:23,000
Scott: Right, so it's not like you have this sort of clash of situations.

463
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:24,209
Scott: But in New York City, right?

464
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:25,760
Scott: I work near ish to Times Square.

465
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:36,310
Scott: You've got people who are living in apartments You got people who are going to fucking work and you have tourists and it's like listen You tourists get the fuck out of the way.

466
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,285
Scott: I live here get the fuck out of my house Right.

467
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:40,417
Rym: The thing is though, isn't it?

468
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:47,347
Scott: You got to admit it's a name you've got and you got people like preying on the tourists also getting in your way every Time we walk out of the office building.

469
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:50,000
Scott: It's like hey you guys want to see a comedy show and free beer?

470
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,029
Scott: It's like shut the fuck up.

471
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:52,842
Rym: I Know the deal.

472
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:54,850
Rym: It's shitty comedy and it's shitty beer.

473
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:56,095
Rym: I've been down that road.

474
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:59,693
Scott: Yeah, you're the comedian You already drank the beer.

475
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,986
Scott: Now I keep trying to like.

476
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:11,068
Scott: I have this plan that basically I'm gonna sneak up on him and be like Hey, you like comedy and beer, you know and give them their own shit but they always get me.

477
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:17,920
Scott: I saw a guy and I Made eye contact with him and I was ready to go and he got me from like 10 feet away.

478
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,500
Scott: I'm like, dude, he saw you come I was gonna get you when I was at 7 feet away.

479
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:24,695
Rym: He knew you're not the first New Yorker to think of that.

480
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:25,700
Scott: I'm gonna get him next time.

481
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:32,059
Rym: You should do When the hobo is about to ask you for money, you should ask him for money.

482
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:33,292
Scott: I hope I was never asked him.

483
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:33,879
Scott: I started to go.

484
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:35,503
Rym: It depends.

485
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:36,427
Rym: I've run into a couple.

486
00:30:36,447 --> 00:30:39,540
Scott: of the only ones I don't like are the ones that are the the subway hobos.

487
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,773
Scott: So they get on and give you the speech.

488
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:41,460
Scott: It's like shut up.

489
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:43,793
Scott: We know it's all lies.

490
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:44,137
Scott: Shut up.

491
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:47,790
Rym: The thing is it's also all lies outside of the city.

492
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,880
Rym: I remember one day I came home from you know to beacon late at night.

493
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:56,960
Rym: I'm walking back from the train and This guy gives me the sob the sob story which reeked of bullshit of you know.

494
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:59,111
Rym: I just need money to like blah blah blah.

495
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:00,819
Scott: I need some change to get on the bus.

496
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:04,260
Rym: I need you know, but he gives me the story about like how his truck broke down.

497
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,033
Rym: He's got to get money to do something for gets towed whatever whatever whatever.

498
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,580
Rym: and I was like, yeah, right, whatever dude.

499
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:16,559
Rym: and he yelled at me and The next day I came home and the same dude tells me the same story.

500
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:18,732
Rym: and I was like Don't you recognize me from yesterday?

501
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:22,679
Rym: And he was like, oh And he kind of just like backed away.

502
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,084
Scott: You know you should do.

503
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:29,057
Scott: is anyone who comes and tells you any story, right?

504
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:34,403
Scott: You should just be like Yeah, you told me the same story yesterday, even if they didn't That would be a good idea.

505
00:31:34,764 --> 00:31:40,760
Rym: I've realized that anyone who starts talking engages you on the street unless they want directions.

506
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:41,820
Rym: Yes, but it's fine.

507
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:52,680
Rym: So think of this anyone who engages you on the street and does not begin The first thing they say to you is not either a direct greeting or the beginning of a question.

508
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,520
Rym: They're scamming you because the people who are scamming you and asking for money never immediately ask for money.

509
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:04,619
Rym: They start telling you the story exactly, but someone who's actually lost or actually has a problem says hey, can you help me out?

510
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,479
Rym: But the scammers never do that.

511
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:16,014
Rym: The scammers always are like yeah, my son right over there fought in the war Civil War whatever war you can remember Yeah, the Civil War.

512
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:20,180
Scott: really Well, I can definitely get you a lot of money if that is true.

513
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:31,139
Rym: that's always the joke in my building cuz it's the Lincoln building and it's the building is always like pre-war pre-war pre-war and The joke is always yeah, what the Civil War is the building's piece of shit.

514
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:34,640
Rym: There's some problems in there anyway.

515
00:32:35,242 --> 00:32:45,327
Scott: so the pretty much the only other thing there is to say about New York City is that once you live here you can't live anywhere else because pretty much Anything you want is here immediately.

516
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:51,731
Scott: this except fucking donuts this donuts here not good donuts when I wear Tell me where to get a good donut.

517
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:52,940
Scott: Let's go type into the Google.

518
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,490
Rym: It's gonna be like one place way downtown.

519
00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,028
Rym: You have to go like 40 minutes out of my way to find it Donut plant New York City.

520
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:00,611
Scott: How about that?

521
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:02,760
Rym: Is that a shop or is that a factory?

522
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,204
Scott: I'm gonna find out real soon.

523
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:06,591
Rym: that is a shop or a factory.

524
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:08,797
Scott: So really it's a. it's a flash website.

525
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:17,280
Scott: So it's all Yeast donut strawberry trace leches peanut butter glaze blackberry jelly vanilla bean glaze blackberry.

526
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,379
Rym: These sound like fake Dunkin Donuts style donuts and not a real old-school fried donuts.

527
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:24,606
Scott: Whatever you and your just donut.

528
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:28,237
Rym: ism real donuts like what bakers make not Dunkin Donuts.

529
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,080
Rym: Those are not donuts.

530
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,024
Rym: They look like donuts.

531
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:31,309
Rym: They taste a little like donuts.

532
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:33,980
Scott: They're not donuts their bakery of the year for 2008.

533
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,603
Scott: So, how about that?

534
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:37,493
Rym: also, you know, what is not terribly common in New York City?

535
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:39,320
Rym: good submarine sandwiches.

536
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:49,228
Rym: there's good paninis and good other kinds of sandwiches and good like kosher deli sandwiches, but a traditional like Submarine sub kind of sandwich.

537
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,474
Rym: They're not that common.

538
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:51,538
Rym: They're not that easy to find.

539
00:33:52,482 --> 00:33:52,923
Rym: No, they're.

540
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:55,893
Rym: you know, I feel like you get better subs in Philly and in the Midwest.

541
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:59,815
Scott: That's just a you know a Geographical situation.

542
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:01,851
Rym: Yeah I mean New York.

543
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:03,220
Rym: not everything in New York is perfect.

544
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:06,620
Scott: Also, I'm sure there's probably at least one place you can get them somewhere.

545
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:11,621
Rym: Also, one of the drawbacks of living in the city is that much of Manhattan does in fact smell like urine through most of The summer.

546
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,480
Rym: so there's really no way around that don't go.

547
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,039
Rym: However, right now it smells more like flowers than urine in most of the city.

548
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,599
Scott: Well, if you're near a park, I mean, uh, and there isn't a hobo in the park.

549
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,277
Rym: God last night that hobo on the train.

550
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:35,257
Scott: Yeah, if you see if you see a bunch of subway cars and one of them is empty and it looks like there's a hobo In there getting a different car that's crowded because the hobo price smells real bad smell doesn't get out.

551
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:38,829
Rym: So See I was gonna say something before I get sidetracked.

552
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:52,780
Rym: it is cool as much as the tourists piss me off and get in my Way, I don't mind them that much just because it's kind of a weird cool thing To have something that I just live in and just take for granted and use all the time like the stairway in Grand Central.

553
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:53,620
Rym: Just it's a stairway.

554
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:02,059
Rym: I use it and yet people will fly from all over the world to go into this place Stand on the thing that I just use and take a picture to prove that they were there.

555
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:06,295
Scott: Yeah, this is why you know, I need I need to be able to think tourist to death.

556
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:09,950
Scott: just with my mind It's like get off the fucking stairs.

557
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,820
Scott: It says no step stopping on the stairs walk.

558
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,029
Rym: I'm using these but one thing I will say.

559
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:24,660
Scott: well one I keep saying that like imagine if you're at work Right, and you're trying to type, you know do some work and someone comes Oh my god, that's Scott's computer and they make you stop working so they can take a picture with your computer.

560
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:25,655
Scott: It's like no you will die.

561
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:29,774
Rym: now New York does cause you to say the word fuck a lot more often.

562
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:32,629
Rym: Yeah, I just Something you've got to notice.

563
00:35:32,649 --> 00:35:38,073
Rym: I mean I say it a lot a Surprising amount and everyone I know says it a lot.

564
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:39,440
Rym: It really isn't a bad word here.

565
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:40,303
Scott: Why is why?

566
00:35:40,343 --> 00:35:41,227
Scott: where is a bad word?

567
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:42,853
Rym: in the red and other places?

568
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:45,844
Rym: if I'm like blah blah blah blah, fuck Blah the fucking blah.

569
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:47,048
Rym: some people go.

570
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:47,329
Rym: Whoo.

571
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:48,673
Scott: Well my word.

572
00:35:48,994 --> 00:35:53,771
Scott: Well, those people are bad people You know, it's a bad word here.

573
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:54,313
Scott: Hello.

574
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:55,216
Scott: Hello is a bad word.

575
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:58,024
Rym: No, it's fine Hello is not that bad?

576
00:35:58,245 --> 00:35:58,967
Scott: don't talk to me.

577
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:01,356
Rym: that word is sir, I would.

578
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:02,420
Rym: I would like to talk to you.

579
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:07,183
Scott: That's a lot more than one word Right.

580
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:10,460
Rym: a complaint people have about New York is that it makes you hard.

581
00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:16,860
Rym: People always say yeah, it makes you hard and I can see someone having the impression that we are you hard that we are harder.

582
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:17,603
Rym: I mean look it has.

583
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:21,360
Rym: this conversation is fuck those tourists get those hobos out of my way.

584
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:26,020
Rym: This sucks urine Fuck okay.

585
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:26,802
Scott: But

586
00:36:27,504 --> 00:36:52,840
Rym: I think the misconception a lot of people have about New York is that they they see what is in fact Straight up honesty and somehow misconstrue it as anger frustration unpoliteness or meanness when really I think people in New York City are just desperately incredibly Straightforwardly honest about everything with each other except for the people trying to scam money off of tourists.

587
00:36:53,020 --> 00:37:04,140
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know a lot of people talk about things like oh, you know, this southern hospitality or oh You know people are so, you know nice and friendly in country X, right?

588
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,480
Scott: And what it is is those people they have, you know, they put on a show not everywhere in Costa Rica.

589
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,800
Rym: I get the impression that everyone I met legitimately was that friendly and happy.

590
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,006
Scott: Yeah, it's pot, you know, they're those places too.

591
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:26,374
Scott: But the thing is that you know acting friendly, you know, and you know Is is Completely different from actually I would rather have people just be honest then act friendly.

592
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:31,951
Scott: whether the friendliness was true or false You know because it's like listen, I don't even know you.

593
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:35,000
Scott: so why am I gonna waste all these extra words?

594
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:45,150
Scott: Saying all things like, you know, hello and good evening, and please and thank you right wasting a whole bunch of time You got shit to do.

595
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:46,780
Rym: there's no defending grammar with you.

596
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,021
Rym: I think.

597
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:47,524
Rym: at one point.

598
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:56,959
Rym: I remember you arguing with me trying to say that using politeness in any context was basically manipulation and mind an attempted mind control.

599
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:11,452
Rym: But but at the same time notice how Rapidly New Yorkers want to show themselves the fuck off.

600
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:16,295
Rym: if a tourist is standing there looking at a map Like 20 people be like hey you want some help.

601
00:38:16,315 --> 00:38:17,080
Rym: Where are you trying to go?

602
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,926
Rym: What are you trying to get to?

603
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:18,793
Rym: looking for the end train?

604
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:19,519
Rym: It's down there.

605
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:29,980
Rym: So Yeah, slight microphone cable issue, so we're just picking right up here rather than me trying to cleverly edit this whole thing out Again, yeah, I'm lazy.

606
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:31,649
Rym: What of it?

607
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,237
Rym: What's it to you?

608
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,422
Scott: lazy ass New York person I Think the.

609
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:47,039
Scott: the main thing that has changed in my life though Is that you know in addition to the additional free time right of not having to commute in such-and-such is that?

610
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:55,608
Scott: Pretty much everything I could possibly imagine I guess with the exception of donuts and subs according to RAM right is available to me.

611
00:38:55,709 --> 00:39:00,268
Rym: anything I want, you know and One other is not available to me.

612
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:01,071
Scott: I don't have to what.

613
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,220
Scott: stop listing things that aren't available to you.

614
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,674
Scott: Everything is available here, right?

615
00:39:04,896 --> 00:39:05,320
Scott: You just haven't.

616
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:08,180
Scott: Every time you think of something that's not in New York City.

617
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,047
Scott: We always find it.

618
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:10,599
Scott: so you didn't just shut up with any of that.

619
00:39:10,861 --> 00:39:14,240
Rym: Let's find some good donuts and actually confirm that they're good donuts, right?

620
00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:20,780
Scott: Is that I don't have to worry about like taking the train home or spending money in a hotel or anything like that?

621
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,939
Scott: So I can do whatever I want in the city 24/7 and all these things are there.

622
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:26,484
Scott: So just the.

623
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:35,508
Scott: the number of options I have of things I can do in my life are expanded like like Exponentially many many times over.

624
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:39,323
Rym: I mean if I want to play board games, there's just people playing board games I just go play with them.

625
00:39:39,364 --> 00:39:40,207
Rym: It just it's like.

626
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:45,230
Scott: no matter what you're into no matter what you want to do You can do it if you're in.

627
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,100
Scott: you know bumblefuck, right?

628
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:59,392
Scott: Even if you're smarter than me and have more money than me and better than me in every possible way and you're cooler and everything You just can't do as many things You know that you could be doing if you lived in New York City.

629
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:02,988
Scott: if you wanted to learn, you know Say, I don't know.

630
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:05,520
Rym: a good example from from last night.

631
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:13,332
Rym: We went to an event at a place where they do like the center Center for book arts, right and they have typesetting classes.

632
00:40:13,713 --> 00:40:15,660
Scott: you want to learn typesetting out in bumblefuck?

633
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,708
Scott: Well, it better be a specific bumblefuck.

634
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:20,980
Scott: that happens to have like, you know a place with a bunch of printing presses.

635
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:23,696
Scott: Otherwise, you ain't gonna learn shit out there, right?

636
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:36,839
Scott: But if you want to learn bookbinding or freaking potteries or fucking potter is pretty widespread computers or You know anything that you can imagine any activity any?

637
00:40:37,846 --> 00:40:43,431
Scott: Education any book any Item, you know, it's not just learning to either.

638
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:50,039
Scott: It's like oh, you know this new movie came out You know in some foreign country, it's in a theater in New York somewhere, you know.

639
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:55,699
Scott: Oh this you know, this movie is coming out, but it's also gonna be an ultra IMAX 3d.

640
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:57,408
Scott: Oh, yeah, ultra IMAX 3d.

641
00:40:57,428 --> 00:40:59,098
Scott: We got like five of those, you know.

642
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:13,140
Rym: So Scott saw right there aside small observations, New York Despite the fact that it's one of the denser, you know, like happening 24/7 places in the world It's still not as dense or 24/7 as you might be led to believe.

643
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:19,780
Rym: I mean late at night like after about 2 a.m Midtown and a lot of the city is just ghost town.

644
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:21,560
Rym: There's no one around everything's closed.

645
00:41:21,649 --> 00:41:23,226
Scott: Yeah It really depends on where you are.

646
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:27,765
Rym: very small number of neighborhoods keep going all night long Like the st.

647
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:30,219
Rym: Mark area is pretty much rocking until the Sun comes up.

648
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,303
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's it's.

649
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:34,112
Scott: it depends if there's a lot of bars somewhere right?

650
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:36,660
Scott: those places usually have later night activity, right?

651
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:44,200
Scott: But places that are say all office buildings like Midtown you or touristy things tourists don't really hang out that late.

652
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,145
Scott: They'll hang out, you know it's a midnight ish maybe.

653
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:47,451
Scott: or it's all like the Broadway shows.

654
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:53,700
Scott: get out and then they'll eat a late dinner or something and then they're gone and Office buildings people are gone after like six seven eight.

655
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:58,319
Scott: So any of those areas are gonna be empty at night and there's not gonna be much going on.

656
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,169
Rym: And - it's not as like.

657
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:02,594
Rym: it's as dense as it is.

658
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:07,078
Rym: it still feels Less dense than I kind of want it to be.

659
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:12,710
Rym: it's weird like I have this idealized just Density of ideas and people and everything all together.

660
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:15,800
Rym: and yet even New York feels very wide and open.

661
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,493
Rym: I'm gonna take the subway past large parks and big swatches of trees.

662
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:20,316
Scott: It's not.

663
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:32,660
Scott: you know a like an uber dense city like, you know some places in India or Japan or any of those right or China where people are stacked like cordwood, you know, you have some room in New York City.

664
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,540
Rym: Well, that's the biggest thing.

665
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:41,652
Rym: the main reason I didn't want to move into the city originally was that I did not believe I had enough money to live in a Large enough place to suit my needs.

666
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:42,580
Rym: I mean me personally.

667
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:59,480
Rym: I wanted to have a recording studio like I needed a separate place for that and I wanted to be able to entertain large numbers of guests on a regular basis the kinds of things I wanted a house for and At First I my idea of how much space I needed was about double what I actually ended up getting now.

668
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:14,579
Rym: Because the thing about New York is that you have all these kind of shared spaces that you can just use when you need them and it kind of Adds these extra rooms to your apartment that just aren't directly connected to it, but are still yours to use.

669
00:43:15,245 --> 00:43:16,012
Scott: Yeah, that is.

670
00:43:16,214 --> 00:43:21,980
Scott: one thing though Is that everyone is always looking for in New York is like let's say you've got I don't know a club.

671
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:25,660
Scott: You just want to start a club and you need to have meeting somewhere, right?

672
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,205
Scott: Where are you gonna have this meeting?

673
00:43:27,747 --> 00:43:28,491
Scott: a coffee shop?

674
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:30,720
Scott: Okay, so the coffee shop is already crowded with patrons.

675
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:33,875
Scott: You're gonna scrounge up some tiny ass tables and get together.

676
00:43:33,895 --> 00:43:34,237
Scott: Okay.

677
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:34,860
Scott: Good luck with that.

678
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,192
Scott: Right, you get a bar and you can get the bar to like.

679
00:43:37,232 --> 00:43:38,640
Scott: lend you a table, you know.

680
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,040
Scott: But what if you start getting a big club?

681
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,341
Scott: What if?

682
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:44,280
Scott: what if I'm awesome and I get like a 200 person anime club going in the city?

683
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,119
Scott: Where the fuck am I gonna have this thing?

684
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,002
Rym: Well, there is.

685
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:49,894
Scott: you can't because there is no place to have it unless you have money.

686
00:43:49,914 --> 00:43:52,629
Rym: if mad money Depends on what you're looking for.

687
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:54,320
Rym: It's not actually that expensive.

688
00:43:54,823 --> 00:44:04,168
Rym: The problem is that a lot of the people who join groups like that No one is willing to put forth the accounting and the effort to sort it all out and maintain Everything to continue to get a space right.

689
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,060
Scott: and even if you do get the money like what space are you gonna get?

690
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,750
Rym: actually, the the best place to look is most nicer.

691
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:15,349
Rym: restaurants have a room you can rent out and Off hours you like.

692
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:22,680
Rym: on certain time like earlier in the day on weekends You can get those places pretty mad cheap Usually just for the cost of the food and a nominal fee on top of it.

693
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:27,180
Scott: It depends and often those rooms are not suited to particular activities.

694
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,066
Rym: The other thing is if you go you want like if you go just out of Manhattan There's actually plenty of spaces.

695
00:44:31,106 --> 00:44:32,111
Rym: people just don't look that hard.

696
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:34,266
Scott: Yeah, but you got to go out, you know It's not.

697
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:35,400
Scott: you know a lot of it.

698
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:44,083
Scott: So you're gonna get a lot less people if you try to do something like, you know out a little bit in Long Island Or out in Jersey and if you do it in Manhattan Straight

699
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:52,400
Rym: I think a lot of the people who are looking for spaces to do these regular things Don't look as hard as they could and don't consider a lot of surprisingly reasonable options.

700
00:44:52,580 --> 00:45:01,815
Scott: Well, I mean you have to you sort of have to know someone or you have to find someone who's got a space that's usually used for something else but isn't being used at that moment and you repurpose it like

701
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:06,413
Rym: like how the mocha is in the Parade room at the batter not the battery the armory.

702
00:45:06,594 --> 00:45:07,076
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

703
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:07,337
Scott: okay.

704
00:45:07,377 --> 00:45:08,060
Scott: This is an armory.

705
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:09,259
Scott: It's in use but you know what?

706
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:17,340
Scott: We will repurpose this armory room that no one is using at this moment to have our comic festival You know, but it just back to my point.

707
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,959
Rym: It was that my apartment is big enough to do everything I want to do.

708
00:45:21,462 --> 00:45:31,718
Rym: But part of that is that outside of my apartment, you know The building has an exercise room and a lounge and a roof and a pool room and I can use all these rooms Like billiards room not assuming pool room.

709
00:45:31,738 --> 00:45:32,844
Rym: Yes Not a pool.

710
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,933
Scott: other other apartment buildings do have a pool.

711
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:37,827
Rym: the run the one next door has a pool But it's you know what?

712
00:45:37,847 --> 00:45:39,798
Scott: The thing is a lot of those are actually tiny pools.

713
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,338
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but I mean that's the thing is out in.

714
00:45:43,379 --> 00:45:48,890
Scott: you know If you get in the suburbs, right you have your own Exercise room you have your own basement.

715
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:51,160
Scott: You have your own swimming pool here.

716
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:55,760
Scott: You pay to join the New York Sports Club and you can just anywhere in the city.

717
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,343
Scott: You have that you that you can find one of these clubs which is a lot of them.

718
00:45:59,805 --> 00:46:06,640
Scott: you have a locker and a shower and a swimming pool and A whole bunch of exercise machines just all over the city.

719
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,039
Scott: You have a whole bunch, you know for this fee that you just pay recurringly and that's it.

720
00:46:11,862 --> 00:46:13,929
Scott: And that's how things work here is mostly just that.

721
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:19,000
Scott: I like the idea that it's more efficient because I remember I don't I don't Have a coffee machine, you know, cuz my kitchen is tiny.

722
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,108
Scott: I have Starbucks is everywhere so matter where I am.

723
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:30,670
Rym: I can just get coffee instantly, but the lifestyle of the suburbs I mean because I grew up in that environment of every family has a house that provides Almost everything you'd want all the time.

724
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:31,514
Rym: I mean in your house.

725
00:46:31,815 --> 00:46:46,358
Rym: You have the exercise room You have the pool outside you have you know if maybe the hot tub or all the billiards room or all these things and As a result you tend to stay in your house all the time or you'll always invite people over to your house.

726
00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:48,324
Rym: New York There's much more of the.

727
00:46:48,746 --> 00:46:50,332
Rym: everyone gets together somewhere.

728
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:52,499
Rym: That isn't a place for any one of them lives.

729
00:46:53,302 --> 00:47:00,453
Scott: You don't want to go to someone's house because they live in a tiny apartment somewhere and like if it's just you visiting or just A couple people it's all good, but you don't spend a lot of time there.

730
00:47:00,514 --> 00:47:01,519
Scott: It's like okay.

731
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:07,628
Scott: We're all sitting on this couch and this tiny apartment and outside There is everything you can possibly imagine to do.

732
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,554
Scott: and inside is what do you have here?

733
00:47:09,574 --> 00:47:16,295
Scott: a fridge with a bear and just enough Food for one person to eat some computers some books and TV.

734
00:47:16,315 --> 00:47:17,378
Scott: Yeah, let's get out of here.

735
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:29,938
Rym: of course one observation along those lines is that Money in New York just makes everything better and everything easier because it is a city where if you have money You can waive it and get just about anything you want.

736
00:47:30,562 --> 00:47:34,760
Scott: Yeah, but at the same time people who don't you know people have significantly less monies than us.

737
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:36,580
Scott: They just get they get by they no problem.

738
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:42,881
Rym: I mean the often surprised how they get by but they do because one the ultra-rich lawyer rides the same subway that the smelly hobo Does.

739
00:47:43,222 --> 00:47:44,666
Rym: that's true like the.

740
00:47:44,766 --> 00:47:55,296
Rym: the democratization of the municipal and shared services like the parks and everything like that is Really cool like everyone uses the same infrastructure to get around and everyone kind of is in this together.

741
00:47:55,757 --> 00:48:06,689
Rym: We're in this together Mm-hmm, but at the same time I'll admit my experience is skewed by the fact that I actually do have a very large apartment and Relatively speaking.

742
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:12,417
Rym: I mean, you know for New York It actually sleeps more people easily than the house and beacon did just because the configuration.

743
00:48:12,818 --> 00:48:23,740
Rym: Yeah It's actually I think a better space than the house and beacon was for entertaining people Because the I remember that was in beacon like that hallway upstairs Which is wasted space and my big-ass bedroom just wasted space.

744
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,779
Rym: You could really use that having people over everyone crammed into that not that big living room.

745
00:48:28,403 --> 00:48:29,654
Rym: The floor kind of bow down.

746
00:48:29,936 --> 00:48:32,065
Rym: Yep That was not optimal.

747
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:36,959
Rym: Nope, but the other observation I have I forget so we'll just move on.

748
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:38,604
Rym: Okay No, I remember.

749
00:48:38,745 --> 00:48:56,576
Rym: so the last night we ate dinner at like the Shake Shack in the park just like late at night after the thing and it was cool, but I Have such a different perspective living in the city now of places like Central Park or you know Brian Park just the parks and the hangout places and the Starbucks's and all these things.

750
00:48:56,656 --> 00:49:08,219
Rym: before were kind of went to them to do an activity specifically like I'd come into the city do a thing there and then leave and there were always these kind of end points for doing things specifically.

751
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:24,078
Rym: and Now that I live here and I don't have to go anywhere after I'm done doing things suddenly these parks take out a very different character like going to Central Park and just kind of milling around is a very different experience from Coming into the city and going to Central Park as an activity.

752
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,459
Rym: Hmm cuz you know if you come in and go like like a tourist like I want to go look at Central Park or I'm Gonna go walk around Central Park.

753
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:32,826
Rym: It kind of puts this impetus on.

754
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:34,612
Rym: your kind of rushes you a little bit.

755
00:49:34,653 --> 00:49:40,292
Rym: you have this this almost duty to Walk around and see it all but you can't experience it from the.

756
00:49:40,734 --> 00:49:43,599
Rym: I'm just gonna go lay in the park for a while because I Got nothing else to do whatever.

757
00:49:44,202 --> 00:49:48,842
Rym: Yeah, so the whole and a lot of the things in the city just have this very different perspective when you don't have to leave It.

758
00:49:49,588 --> 00:50:02,419
Scott: yeah, I mean, you know if you live You know in a particular thing right if you see something every day Right as opposed to it being like a one-day activity I have one day to see this thing or to experience this thing.

759
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:05,980
Scott: In that one day, you're gonna try to experience the whole thing deliberately.

760
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:14,878
Scott: But if you can just experience something whenever you want any part of it at any time, right then It's it's like there was you in a concert and having an mp3, right?

761
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,560
Scott: If you go to a concert you got a. you got experience all the live music while it's there.

762
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,660
Scott: But if you got an mp3, it's like well I can listen to this anytime.

763
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:29,498
Scott: So it's completely different even if it's like the same exact audios and even if you have a concert sound system it's you know, not the exact same.

764
00:50:29,518 --> 00:50:35,863
Scott: so but yeah, the other thing about New York City is that Transportation, right?

765
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:38,814
Scott: We already talked about I guess in-city transportation kind of right.

766
00:50:38,834 --> 00:50:40,983
Scott: you get rid of your car to save money It's awesome.

767
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,826
Rym: You can get everywhere.

768
00:50:41,846 --> 00:50:44,939
Scott: There's no reason to have a car because it's just a hassle.

769
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:49,350
Scott: dude Rollerblade to work every bicycle to work, but I subway up.

770
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,697
Scott: the weather's bad, but you know, it's.

771
00:50:52,118 --> 00:50:54,800
Scott: uh You know, you can just get anywhere in the city.

772
00:50:55,021 --> 00:50:58,859
Scott: You don't want a car cuz the car only gives you trouble just to keep moving it around and you're not.

773
00:50:58,879 --> 00:51:04,220
Scott: well I guess you have so much money that you can get park it somewhere Unless you have money for like a hundred bucks a month.

774
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,719
Rym: I could just park a car in my building and then doorman go and get it for me when I want it.

775
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:09,529
Scott: Yeah, if you have that much money, you're all set.

776
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:12,384
Scott: But if you don't have that much money, just get rid of your car It's only a hassle.

777
00:51:12,826 --> 00:51:20,820
Scott: and then you can take a taxi you can take a subway You can basically you can take a bus you can get anywhere in the city that you want really easily.

778
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:31,575
Scott: You can even get to places like Jersey on the path or Long Island and long on railroad or you can take the Metro North railroad to New York State or Connecticut or All long distance travel is a whole different game.

779
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:44,920
Rym: now living in the city And I remember before you know with the car centric cars are still for most of the kind of travel we do Faster and cheaper and easier But only if you live outside of the city you need the car anyway.

780
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:45,926
Rym: So it's the kind of like.

781
00:51:45,946 --> 00:51:48,119
Rym: it's not like it's an extra cost to maintain the car.

782
00:51:48,502 --> 00:51:53,669
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you already own a car and you need it So you're already paying for insurance and all that stuff already.

783
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:59,689
Scott: So that's already is sunk cost and you need to go to Boston right.

784
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:04,415
Scott: then Driving to Boston is the best idea because you can bring a bunch of stuff with you.

785
00:52:04,897 --> 00:52:05,620
Scott: It's real easy.

786
00:52:05,942 --> 00:52:09,668
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna have to pay for parking which sucks but that's still less than the cost of.

787
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:14,217
Scott: you know some as an airplane and such and you know it makes up for it cuz you can bring stuff with you.

788
00:52:14,237 --> 00:52:23,060
Scott: and Yeah, you have to pay for gas But even that is still less, you know, and there's no hassle of like waiting for a flight to take off or anything like that.

789
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:35,060
Scott: But if you don't own a car, you know, and you know, then suddenly it's like well to drive There is really stupid and expensive because I had to pay to rent a car or buy a car and such and such and such.

790
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:41,311
Scott: You're much better off paying 20 bucks to get on like the Chinatown bus Even though it might break down and does so often.

791
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:42,094
Rym: but that's what's awesome.

792
00:52:42,114 --> 00:52:43,520
Rym: I didn't I guess way back.

793
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:56,080
Rym: I didn't account for the fact that while the delays of taking like a bus or a plane are annoying compared to a car From anywhere else like from Beacon from the city flying is crazy convenient.

794
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:58,339
Scott: Yeah, I mean the airport is just right there.

795
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,165
Scott: It's not like.

796
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:01,619
Scott: you know, I can get to the airport as quickly as I can get to work.

797
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:04,634
Scott: So it's not like a big deal to go fly somewhere.

798
00:53:04,654 --> 00:53:07,868
Scott: it's just like oh I walk out the door I get on a plane whoosh, you know.

799
00:53:07,928 --> 00:53:11,663
Scott: and in the planes, it's not like, you know, I'm in Rochester We're okay.

800
00:53:11,744 --> 00:53:15,641
Scott: if I want to fly to somewhere I have to fly first to New York and then somewhere It's.

801
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:20,860
Scott: I can just go anywhere in the world on a direct flight pretty much for a pretty reasonable price.

802
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:25,060
Scott: So there is a complete access to the entire world from where we are.

803
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,697
Rym: That's just with the planes but the bulk buses and the things like that are fucking awesome.

804
00:53:28,857 --> 00:53:37,740
Scott: I gotta say And it's not internet it's not just physical travel access to the entire world It's not just internet access to the entire world, which everyone I would hope has right?

805
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,513
Scott: It's access to things from around the world.

806
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:46,573
Scott: if our French things Indian things Chinese things I can get things from anywhere in the world.

807
00:53:46,613 --> 00:53:51,688
Scott: just in stores in New York City people from anywhere They're opening a second Uniqlo.

808
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,037
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh, I'd really like to talk to.

809
00:53:54,077 --> 00:53:55,788
Scott: you know, oh shit I'm gonna go to.

810
00:53:56,091 --> 00:53:57,240
Scott: I don't know Slovakia.

811
00:53:57,481 --> 00:53:59,349
Scott: I should really talk to a Slovakian dude.

812
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,498
Scott: Hey, I found a Slovakian dude who lives in New York.

813
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:02,060
Scott: What's up, dude?

814
00:54:02,501 --> 00:54:02,862
Scott: Oh here.

815
00:54:02,882 --> 00:54:04,207
Scott: Look, it's a Slovakian restaurant.

816
00:54:04,247 --> 00:54:05,773
Scott: I can try out some Slovakian food.

817
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:07,680
Scott: There's some books about Slovakian library.

818
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,675
Scott: Well, I hope everyone has that also, but you know, you have access to friggin everything.

819
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:16,873
Scott: It's there somewhere You can find it, you know, oh man.

820
00:54:16,913 --> 00:54:18,320
Scott: I really wish I had this comic book.

821
00:54:18,762 --> 00:54:22,480
Scott: Yeah, I had to drive like, you know an hour to get to the nearest comic book store.

822
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,055
Scott: Yeah, I've got like 20 comic stores like a walk to but that's one of the.

823
00:54:26,095 --> 00:54:27,160
Scott: that's a niche thing.

824
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,265
Scott: There's a whole bunch of them.

825
00:54:29,305 --> 00:54:32,318
Rym: That's really the biggest change in my life of living in the city.

826
00:54:32,518 --> 00:54:37,520
Rym: Is that Before when I lived out of the city, I had this kind of weekend centric life.

827
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:47,097
Rym: I would do things on weekends and on weekdays after work We do the show and I'd kind of stay home and do very, you know home kind of things.

828
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:51,792
Rym: I'd watch anime I'd read but I wouldn't do things.

829
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:59,086
Rym: because doing things outside of the city meant Traveling somewhere at least somewhere somewhat far away maybe even like to Poughkeepsie or something.

830
00:54:59,106 --> 00:55:05,057
Scott: Or it meant staying in the city after work and then Getting on a train and getting home extra late at like 1 a.m.

831
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:13,330
Rym: But even events just doing something that doesn't involve the city at all out out of the city Requires a lot more kind of doing to do.

832
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:19,120
Rym: you got to get your car drive somewhere park go to an event Find dinner later elsewhere pick a rest or all that stuff.

833
00:55:20,023 --> 00:55:25,578
Rym: Now my life is much more just constant like it used to be weekday weekday weekday weekday weekend.

834
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:30,834
Rym: now It's just day day day day and every day I do stuff and every day is different.

835
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:38,658
Rym: It's a lot more like college Except I still have that nine-to-five work in the way, but well, you know, you got to pay for it somehow, right?

836
00:55:38,718 --> 00:55:42,860
Rym: Yeah So whatever I just I I love living here.

837
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:53,053
Rym: I. the only two places I ever want to live in my life again are either in the center of this city as close to the middle of it as I can possibly get or In like a Costa Rican paradise with a poly car.

838
00:55:53,334 --> 00:56:01,280
Scott: Yeah poly chronic lifestyle Yeah, but the thing is even if I live there, you know the poly chronic lifestyle of relaxing in the Sun would be totally awesome.

839
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:05,233
Scott: But every time I wanted to do something well, I'd be like fuck.

840
00:56:05,313 --> 00:56:06,237
Scott: I don't have anything here.

841
00:56:06,257 --> 00:56:07,099
Scott: I have fucking trees.

842
00:56:07,762 --> 00:56:09,347
Scott: Well, I supposed to do the way around.

843
00:56:09,387 --> 00:56:16,620
Rym: that is to be rich enough to have the apartment penthouse apartment in the city and the Costa Rican paradise house and just go back and forth between them whenever you want.

844
00:56:16,902 --> 00:56:18,915
Scott: Yeah, but I spent all the time going back and forth.

845
00:56:18,935 --> 00:56:28,859
Scott: They need a teleporter Or I need a city in a tropical paradise and then I have the penthouse like decks I know I with some palm trees growing on the roof.

846
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,582
Scott: Now that's where it's at.

847
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:40,300
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

848
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,100
