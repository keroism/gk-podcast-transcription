1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,458
Scott: It's Thursday, September 16th.

2
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:12,241
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:14,768
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:18,889
Scott: It's tonight The rest of packs that we didn't spend playing games.

5
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,327
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,544
Rym: So we're back from packs.

7
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:30,289
Rym: We did that experiment.

8
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,314
Scott: We've been back for packs for two weeks.

9
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:33,939
Rym: Yeah, and we are in fact back.

10
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:39,009
Rym: We've only had one weekend since packs And I know what do we spend that weekend doing?

11
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:41,340
Rym: playing games playing games at a con.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,078
Scott: I got to do some laundry possibly tonight because I have stuff going on.

13
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:51,666
Scott: oh Shit, no Sunday, and I have no underwear, and I bought a bunch of underwears on the internet But they're not here.

14
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:53,440
Rym: Do you have plenty of time on Saturday?

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,178
Rym: We're not running the game until people show up.

16
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,388
Scott: I guess I could do early laundry.

17
00:00:57,529 --> 00:01:00,000
Rym: now you got to come over and record that thing for project St.

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,198
Scott: Okay, is that project shit talk?

19
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:05,251
Scott: That means I don't have to do it because it's all shit though.

20
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:12,020
Scott: project ast I guess Project anti shit perhaps or perhaps project NST no shit talk.

21
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:18,860
Rym: So I figure we can get right into this since I know a lot of you wanted our actual packs review as opposed to Just the review of games at packs.

22
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:23,300
Rym: So I have the littlest little news because it kind of links into one of the panels we did at packs.

23
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:26,400
Rym: Kotaku has this thing what are the biggest selling?

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,828
Rym: Super Mario Brothers games super.

25
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:30,998
Scott: so Mario Brothers with the pipes doesn't count.

26
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,744
Rym: no It's Super Mario Brothers.

27
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,956
Rym: and like Super Mario Land Mario World Game & Watch doesn't count.

28
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:40,425
Rym: Super Mario Land 2 Yoshi's Island Okay, and basically.

29
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,030
Scott: so get the gate golden coins.

30
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:44,278
Scott: Super Mario Land on the game boy doesn't count.

31
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:44,960
Rym: what I can say.

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,865
Rym: It makes me very happy.

33
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:46,830
Rym: Are you that?

34
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:48,560
Rym: no are your games that?

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,143
Rym: The numbers here?

36
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:50,825
Rym: because the plate.

37
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:54,920
Rym: they claim to have done some research and they have the actual release numbers from Nintendo.

38
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:55,823
Scott: so wait at this.

39
00:01:55,924 --> 00:02:05,616
Rym: all-time sales or release sales all-time worldwide sales, okay, and They pretty much match the numbers I had in the egregiously unrealized potential number one is Mario 3?

40
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:10,019
Rym: right Mario 1 Has almost doubled the sales of all because it came with every NES.

41
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,885
Rym: That's Unfair is it?

42
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:12,267
Rym: is it?

43
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,800
Rym: more people probably played it than played Mario.

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,700
Scott: It's the same as with Wii Sports where it came with the system and that's why its numbers are off the chart.

45
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:21,984
Rym: Yeah But I recall.

46
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:30,777
Rym: but the point is this is interesting to look at because even if you remove Mario 1 Mario games don't sell as much as they used to no kidding.

47
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:34,395
Rym: of course part of it is that there's this long tail.

48
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:38,459
Rym: Nintendo keeps Re-releasing old Mario games for you to buy again.

49
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:45,983
Scott: Oh So when I if I buy a copy of Super Mario Brothers Which because they re-released it identically for the GBA or if I buy it on the virtual console Is it adding?

50
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:47,509
Scott: are they lumping all those together?

51
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:49,115
Rym: So I can't tell in some charts.

52
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:50,079
Rym: they do into some charts.

53
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,562
Rym: They don't Bullshit.

54
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:52,003
Scott: All right.

55
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:52,746
Rym: What do you mean bullshit?

56
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:53,469
Rym: the game sold?

57
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:55,798
Scott: Yeah, but one person bought it three times.

58
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:58,640
Rym: Yeah One person buys a movie three times.

59
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:05,300
Scott: So, okay So the so the packs and San Diego comic-con attendance figures are totally legit with their multiplying one person times three days.

60
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:09,335
Rym: They would be if they were up front about that and they didn't say this.

61
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,302
Rym: many people came if they said This.

62
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:15,300
Rym: many people came over three days counting each day individually.

63
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:28,192
Rym: Yeah Anyway, but it does raise the interesting point that there's this huge perception in gamers about about what games are popular What games are not popular what games sell what games don't sell.

64
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:30,140
Rym: and in that panel?

65
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:40,700
Rym: I was sad to point out that the of the top five games played on Steam every day Counter-strike one six and counter-strike source are basically tied for number one.

66
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:44,580
Rym: Yep, Team Fortress 2 is like number four and it's not even number.

67
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:48,271
Scott: I wish they would put the effort into counter-strike.

68
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:49,856
Scott: They put into Team Fortress 2.

69
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:50,900
Rym: they started to all these.

70
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,010
Rym: There's a been a whole bunch of updates lately and counter-strike.

71
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:55,536
Scott: Why don't they update cs1.6 a little bit though?

72
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:57,703
Rym: Fuck cs1.6.

73
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:59,490
Rym: What do you mean?

74
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:00,394
Scott: Why bother?

75
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:01,659
Scott: because it's so many people playing it.

76
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:04,079
Scott: Yeah, you can sell copies of half-life one.

77
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,369
Rym: I don't think they would.

78
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,518
Rym: they couldn't make enough money off a counter-strike one.

79
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:11,618
Rym: six Because no one new is going to pick up one.

80
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:11,879
Rym: six.

81
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:15,751
Rym: No one who's like I want to play a game like counter-strike thing is.

82
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,700
Scott: it's useful because you can play it on a shitty old computer.

83
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:22,353
Rym: By now you can play counter-strike source on a shitty old computer.

84
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:24,100
Rym: I can play counter-strike source on my laptop.

85
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,106
Scott: It would be really nice.

86
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:27,380
Scott: is you know how they could get a bunch of sales, right?

87
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:31,440
Scott: They ported the source engine over to all the other computers like the Macs and whatnot.

88
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:33,488
Scott: Yeah, and they said they're never gonna do.

89
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:35,698
Scott: they said we don't have plans for Steam on Linux.

90
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:36,160
Scott: that you know.

91
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,286
Scott: That was X nade.

92
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:41,673
Scott: but bring the half-life one Engine over to the Mac and such.

93
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,106
Scott: that'll be pretty difficult But it'll be worth it.

94
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:48,871
Rym: because you know, it's just interesting that when you look at sales numbers I mean, it's easy to say this game is popular.

95
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:49,575
Rym: This game's not.

96
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:50,400
Rym: this game's a blockbuster.

97
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,265
Rym: This game's not.

98
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:59,025
Rym: but and like we pointed out at the panel people Gasped when I showed just a collection of sales numbers of various games Mm-hmm.

99
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:02,140
Rym: So this is an interesting little graph and that's all I had.

100
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,334
Rym: I wanted something quick before we talk about packs.

101
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:05,340
Scott: My thing is quick.

102
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,420
Rym: Also, apparently, you know the anarchist cookbook the book that basically should better be titled how to fuck up and kill yourself exactly.

103
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:22,237
Scott: apparently this guy wrote it when he was like 19 years old, you know back in 1969 right and he basically did.

104
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:27,535
Scott: he did it by going to the New York City Public Library researching things and just compiling Information.

105
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,089
Scott: he researched and there you had it.

106
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:38,289
Rym: So I should point out when I got internet access actual internet not AOL not prodigy internet for the first time in my life My whole family crowded around the computer.

107
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:58,947
Scott: We sat there and I went a little search and I typed bomb making instructions And my dad was like, all right nice sweet but anyway This is whole thing on Amazon right has a from the author note on this book and he talks about how he wrote it.

108
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:06,790
Scott: and now This dude, you know being now older and you know with a family and kids and being like it.

109
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:08,916
Rym: Oh, is this a regret situation?

110
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:13,170
Scott: Yeah, he's now like an Anglican something something, right?

111
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:16,810
Scott: He's all religious and good goody-goody now, so he's like man.

112
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:26,939
Scott: I wish they would take this book out of print because apparently what happened is He doesn't even get royalties cuz like the publisher just put them as the copyright and not him Even though he has you know, his name is on the book.

113
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:28,826
Scott: He doesn't actually get anything for it.

114
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:29,730
Rym: I hate to say it.

115
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:33,237
Scott: It's his fault Yeah, but he's like I. he's like.

116
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:36,768
Scott: I would be pleased and relieved to see his publication discontinued.

117
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:37,370
Scott: It's like dude.

118
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:40,610
Scott: I mean, seriously, no, here's the problem.

119
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:46,690
Rym: When they discontinue that that just means that some much better book is on bit torrent.

120
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:57,288
Scott: I know right this guy clearly is not aware of the the 21st century Very much and also has no respect for you know, free speech.

121
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:02,630
Rym: really No, cuz he didn't say he's not trying to like sue people and force it down.

122
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,583
Scott: Oh, no, but I mean, it's like you should use a lot of no matter how disgusting.

123
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:10,698
Scott: I mean even a book like Oh, no.

124
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:17,510
Rym: No, look what he's saying, though He's not fighting to actually get it taking down because the epitome of free speech is saying in the marketplace of ideas.

125
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:19,022
Rym: This is what I believe.

126
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:20,070
Rym: This is what I want.

127
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:20,934
Rym: So what's he saying?

128
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:24,129
Rym: I would rather this book not be out there bla da ba da ba.

129
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:27,970
Rym: But because he has no power to enforce that he's exercising his own free speech.

130
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,556
Rym: That's validating the fact that the book is.

131
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:30,259
Scott: but I would not.

132
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,890
Scott: you would never say right even the most disgusting book.

133
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,436
Scott: What's that nymph at right?

134
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:38,250
Scott: I would never say I want nymph at to be out of print, right?

135
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,367
Scott: Yeah, I would never wish for a work of art to cease being.

136
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:41,770
Scott: that's like.

137
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:44,542
Scott: That's like cheering while the Library of Alexandria burns.

138
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:53,229
Rym: not everything in there was amazing Yeah, but at the same time in the marketplace of ideas that is his idea and as a bad idea They're their worst ideas.

139
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:54,413
Scott: You know what?

140
00:07:54,734 --> 00:08:02,796
Scott: I would rather have people making bombs and doing what's in the anarchist cookbook then trying to eliminate works of art no matter how disgusting.

141
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:10,078
Rym: I agree because the anarchist cookbook is a is a device for removing dangerous and stupid people from Society and I really on their own.

142
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,950
Rym: obviously sadly they might take their cat with them or something.

143
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:15,405
Rym: But well, you know, maybe their parents basement.

144
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:16,210
Scott: That's okay.

145
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:24,752
Rym: So we want to get right into packs.

146
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:25,759
Rym: I know that's what you're waiting for.

147
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:27,320
Scott: So things of the day in better moments.

148
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,451
Rym: So some things of the day are what the music just told us to do.

149
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:31,715
Scott: So here's a guy.

150
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,120
Scott: His name is Wayne Harris.

151
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,808
Scott: He's a freelance illustrator slash character designer.

152
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:41,530
Scott: All right, he's got a web page with a bunch of freelance illustration Character designs.

153
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:48,420
Scott: most of them are characters that you know Drawn in his style and let me say he has the best style or one of the best style.

154
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,423
Rym: I'm digging that mojo.

155
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:53,055
Scott: Jojo is captain caveman is like the best captain caveman.

156
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,620
Scott: I swear to God and also his top cat.

157
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:55,688
Rym: This is good.

158
00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:00,152
Rym: in the same way that remember way back There was that bunch of characters done in the Powerpuff Girls style.

159
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,840
Rym: That was like one of our first things of the day.

160
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:04,193
Rym: Mmm, this gives me the same vibe.

161
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:05,420
Rym: I get the same enjoyment.

162
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:11,680
Scott: Yeah, so he just drew a bunch of characters in his style and they are high quality and it'll entertain you for a few minutes.

163
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:13,525
Scott: And that is very good.

164
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,857
Rym: So what I've got here, I think this is pretty clever.

165
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:17,543
Rym: It's a hoodie That's just a hand.

166
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:20,934
Rym: But if you unzip the zipper, oh shit.

167
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:22,700
Rym: It's a Vulcan whatever.

168
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:25,684
Rym: It's pretty well done.

169
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:26,386
Scott: All right.

170
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:31,446
Rym: Yeah, I know you don't like Star Trek or Firefly or I didn't even know you were talking about Any of those or anything.

171
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,640
Rym: that's good Babylon 5 which isn't that good.

172
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:36,388
Scott: Even know that you're talking about those things that I don't like.

173
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,274
Rym: so Vulcan means nothing to you.

174
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:42,320
Scott: It's a Vulcan cannon like Not even Vulcan izing.

175
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:44,543
Scott: Yeah, you can.

176
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,952
Scott: Vulcan eyes, you know, you know a piece of metal.

177
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:48,257
Rym: Yeah or a tire.

178
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:48,558
Rym: Yeah.

179
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:49,613
Scott: All right Yeah, that's it.

180
00:09:49,940 --> 00:10:00,219
Rym: You know this thing this thing it does this thing with the hands where you've got the two fingers going in opposite directions in The middle kind of like a shocker, but the ring finger is moved toward the pinky.

181
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,047
Scott: Yeah I know the thing.

182
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:03,625
Rym: now that I see it Do you know anything about that thing?

183
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,055
Rym: Can you tell me anything about that thing that I didn't already say?

184
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:07,869
Scott: it's a Star Trek thing All right.

185
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:08,558
Rym: Do you know what it means?

186
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:11,092
Scott: It means I'm a Star Trek nerd.

187
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:11,415
Scott: Look at me.

188
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:11,878
Scott: do the thing.

189
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:16,753
Rym: So very briefly them at a moment.

190
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:17,519
Rym: we were at PAX.

191
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:28,011
Rym: We have PAX coming up We're doing at two or three panels at PAX Boston and this is not official Announcements from penny arcade or PAX or anything.

192
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:30,160
Rym: This is just me talking my personal opinion.

193
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:34,859
Rym: Note that they are calling it packs Boston now and not PAX East.

194
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:44,260
Rym: I feel like that is very telling of things to come Currently or as they called it at PAX Prime bitch packs.

195
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:46,467
Rym: But up I'll have words with that.

196
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,053
Scott: if there's a there's a third.

197
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:50,160
Scott: if there is a third packs, Austin.

198
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:52,266
Rym: Okay, Austin, okay.

199
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:53,371
Scott: Let's let's go down the city.

200
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:55,300
Scott: We're making them at a moment more than a moment.

201
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,892
Scott: So let's let's not talk about that right now.

202
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:57,094
Rym: Now.

203
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:57,880
Rym: You don't want to talk about that.

204
00:10:58,161 --> 00:10:59,043
Rym: Gotta be Austin cuz.

205
00:10:59,063 --> 00:11:00,066
Rym: that's the only good place.

206
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:00,968
Rym: maybe Chicago.

207
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,833
Scott: I think Austin is currently number one.

208
00:11:02,934 --> 00:11:05,200
Scott: Atlanta, Chicago are highly ranked.

209
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:06,799
Scott: Yeah, Vegas, hopefully.

210
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,472
Rym: Now Vegas is where it ends.

211
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:11,583
Scott: Vegas is lowly ranked But I want it.

212
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,927
Rym: Vegas is where it ends.

213
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:13,871
Rym: Vegas is what happened.

214
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:20,160
Rym: Toronto when you've got too close to boss Once you've got 12 packs is a year all over the world.

215
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,712
Rym: Then Vegas is kind of like the final packs like that is the big pack.

216
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:30,327
Scott: France Germany, Tokyo, London, Sydney, okay Bear Lynn right.

217
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:37,960
Scott: so there's some other events that you should be aware of Such as October 8th 9th and 10th, New York comic-con slash, New York anime festival double mega.

218
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:53,157
Rym: We'll be there Friday night I don't know exactly what time doing a brand new anime panel and We're gonna spend most of the rest of our time that weekend at the other competing convention the burning wheel.

219
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:54,709
Scott: 10 10 10 Oh snap.

220
00:11:54,952 --> 00:12:04,349
Scott: Oh shit All right Let's not tell about any other conventions, but there is an event that you should know about Apparently on September the 28th.

221
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:30,446
Scott: There is going to be some sort of John Hodgman Jonathan Colton HBO television something something at the 168th Street Armory National Track and Field Hall of Fame in Washington Heights Not Washington DC, Washington Heights in New York City And there's a whole bunch of information here written in a John Hodgman style that you'll have to decipher in order to figure out the details Going to attempt to attend.

222
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:32,273
Rym: They're not eminently decipherable.

223
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:38,160
Rym: You can make good guesses as to what's gonna happen there But really I mean here's an example of the things you have to decipher.

224
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:39,007
Scott: Quote.

225
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:50,480
Scott: if you follow me on Twitter Then additionally you should say so and when you check in for the show you shall learn that you have received not only special Consideration but also a special surprise that I cannot discuss further at this time.

226
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,695
Rym: I love quote and his second-person style.

227
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,424
Scott: It's the greatest style Of all styles.

228
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,453
Scott: all styles except for styles.

229
00:12:58,614 --> 00:12:59,337
Scott: who is pretty sure?

230
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:06,479
Rym: horn blowers Wow, I wasn't sure where you were going with that.

231
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,832
Rym: So packs PAX Prime 2010 was clearly the best.

232
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:12,755
Scott: Oh, I thought you were.

233
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:14,259
Scott: I thought you were extending them at a moment.

234
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,407
Rym: now I'm talking about packs.

235
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,938
Scott: Every packs is the best packs.

236
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:17,139
Scott: yet.

237
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:23,267
Rym: Yes, and that has been proven to me because every packs I've ever been to has been the best packs I have ever been to without exception.

238
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:23,769
Rym: That's true.

239
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,060
Scott: But this packs I've been to four packs is total.

240
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,094
Rym: This packs really kind of stepped up the game.

241
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:39,160
Scott: Yeah withstanding Tycho calling packs Boston bitch packs Judging by the greatness there, you know, every packs is better than the previous but you know by different margins.

242
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:39,923
Scott: You know packs.

243
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:42,150
Scott: Oh nine was only marginally better than packs.

244
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:42,933
Scott: Oh wait, it was better.

245
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:48,600
Rym: 2010 was way Better than any previous but it's interesting.

246
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,460
Rym: It was better in a lot of very subtle ways because not a lot changed.

247
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:54,879
Rym: It was these little touches that just made it better.

248
00:13:55,602 --> 00:14:04,360
Scott: There were some aspects that also decreased but the aspects which increased When you compared them and made a sum the total profits of greatness.

249
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,180
Rym: It's one of those jumps like that year when Otakon just had like eight thousand more people than they had the year before.

250
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,706
Rym: Yeah, I guess one of those.

251
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:18,214
Rym: but I feel like unlike Otakon packs that this is momentum Mmm, because the changes are not dependent upon attendance.

252
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:24,674
Rym: The changes are just basically Enforcers being badasses coupled with a thriving industry that's undergoing a renaissance.

253
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:25,315
Scott: Yeah.

254
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:26,940
Scott: Okay, so awesomeness number one.

255
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,387
Scott: Well, I guess you already talked about game.

256
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:33,844
Rym: Yeah, let's cover the big change like not the big changes But the big points of packs, okay So they moved.

257
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:36,140
Scott: the main events has been Arroyo Hall down the road

258
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,065
Rym: Which is where the symphony plays

259
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:53,700
Scott: which was good in some ways in which because you could totally sit down and chill right, and they were able to you know, have two cues instead of this one big queue and It had the expo hall was greatly increased into the former queue room.

260
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:59,100
Rym: I was disappointed about until I entered that expo hall and realized how off-the-hook it was.

261
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,220
Scott: Yeah, usually the expo halls like okay as the expo hall, but this year the expo hall was OMG

262
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:10,172
Rym: I was walking around kind of dumbfounded when I first walked in much like that first Otakon where I walked into that fucking dealers room yeah

263
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:22,409
Scott: But yeah, the Benaroya Hall was was good But the two problems with it were that number one since there was seats and there was no general admission The capacity was greatly diminished was like way

264
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:23,613
Rym: 2,500 just 1,500 or 3,000 something like that.

265
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,211
Scott: So it was that it was hard to get in there.

266
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:32,399
Scott: You had to line up way in advance to see any Benaroya Hall event last year.

267
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:36,437
Rym: We would just wait until like 20 minutes after a concert started and just walk right in.

268
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:40,740
Scott: no big deal Yeah, because it was one big empty concrete room that could hold probably 5,000.

269
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:52,210
Rym: But when I saw people tweeting that the concert on Saturday had been going for an hour and they still couldn't let people in Yeah Yeah, there was no because once you got inside you weren't getting out now Right because they were limited seats and every seat was full.

270
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,355
Scott: There was a butt in every chair.

271
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:54,039
Scott: So that's that.

272
00:15:55,401 --> 00:16:02,339
Scott: The other thing I heard but I did not experience personally because I didn't go to any concerts Was that because it was where the symphony plays?

273
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:15,680
Scott: Instruments and such were amazingly sounding but vocals were hard to hear which is Good for some like on a Monoguchi but bad for others like Jonathan Colton and you know, Paul and storm.

274
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:22,799
Rym: So well, there's the third aspect of Benaroya Hall that there was talk about streaming and then it didn't happen at first.

275
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:28,727
Rym: then it did but it looks like what was streamed was streamed over you stream and That's not so great.

276
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:31,380
Scott: Yeah, but apparently it was successfully streamed.

277
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,980
Scott: I heard to the queue room and also to the bring your own PC area.

278
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,318
Scott: So there were many people who were able to watch the concerts and enjoy them over the you stream.

279
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,243
Rym: Yep I don't know.

280
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:44,079
Scott: I feel like I was playing tabletop games.

281
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:55,939
Rym: I don't know what to do about the main event situation of packs because it like anime cons It's such a different idea like the main events like a lot of people want to go But a lot of people pointedly do not want to go.

282
00:16:56,461 --> 00:17:01,037
Rym: So it's usually self-limiting and then like Otagan just has a fucking arena next door that holds like 15,000 people.

283
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:04,260
Rym: Yeah, well, I don't know what packs can do.

284
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,819
Rym: There's only like one other big venue and we have it on good authority that the venue consists entirely of dicks.

285
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:20,133
Scott: Yeah, well this it's called the sky something something and only does the capacity of it is not that much more than the capacity of The Benaroya Hall, but apparently they had some dumb requirements and it was.

286
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,000
Rym: it was not an optimal solution.

287
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:23,705
Scott: I heard they were no good those people.

288
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:29,567
Scott: I really don't know what to do except leave Seattle or They can't leave Seattle.

289
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,174
Rym: That's like telling the Romans to leave Rome.

290
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:34,987
Rym: They just build in freighter Greater cities further away.

291
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,756
Rym: build at PAX East that's twice as big as PAX Prime.

292
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:42,594
Rym: build a PAX Austin That's twice big and PAX Prime is ends up being the exclusive club.

293
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:44,020
Rym: You gotta buy the lifetime now.

294
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,120
Rym: You have to be born into an admission.

295
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:51,099
Scott: I think one thing they could do is they could just say look expo Hall we need to have main events over here.

296
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,920
Scott: You're gonna force the expo Hall to be this size.

297
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:04,157
Scott: We're not gonna let it grow anymore and we're just gonna charge way more money to be in here except for we're gonna set Aside this amount of space for the small guys so that they can get in still.

298
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:04,860
Scott: they won't be kicked out.

299
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,686
Rym: You know, here's the trouble.

300
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:06,793
Rym: the expo Hall size.

301
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:13,896
Rym: this year like last year I feel like there was space where there was stuff I was not excited about or didn't look too cool took up room.

302
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:16,046
Rym: this year There was pretty much.

303
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:24,219
Scott: every single booth with very few exceptions was crazy Yeah, but thing is most of the really big booths that took up a lot of space are the ones I had no interest in.

304
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,405
Scott: I do like yeah, but that didn't.

305
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:31,619
Scott: that wasn't that big compared to say Lego universe or you know Lego universe.

306
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:35,140
Rym: talk about Disappointing game, but I already reviewed all the games we played.

307
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,460
Scott: We're not gonna talk about games again or like, you know, like look at the size that brink booth, right?

308
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,111
Scott: They didn't actually use all that space very well.

309
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:43,737
Scott: It was just big to get your attention.

310
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:57,206
Scott: It's spectacle Yeah, and I think that you know that if they cranked up the cost for those guys then some of them might shrink their booths to save money be a little less ostentatious right and That will allow more of them to fit in.

311
00:18:57,507 --> 00:18:59,895
Scott: you know the the space but the thing is you also.

312
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:02,768
Scott: the other thing is bigger space in the expo Hall.

313
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:07,453
Scott: also notice how we didn't have to really Worm your way around the expo Hall so much.

314
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,719
Scott: It was nice and open.

315
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,786
Scott: there Did not have crowd.

316
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:13,620
Rym: basically there was no reason to wait in line to get into the expo Hall.

317
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,372
Rym: We just walked in like five minutes after the con opened.

318
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:18,260
Scott: Yeah, cuz the capacity was increased.

319
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:19,051
Rym: So I don't know.

320
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:27,264
Rym: part of that too I realized is that people went into the expo Hall and I think the majority got into one of like the five two-hour lines To do something crazy.

321
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:30,437
Rym: Yep, like play Duke Nukem or play whatever.

322
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:32,160
Rym: Yep whatever.

323
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:34,505
Scott: So what else?

324
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:35,188
Scott: what else went down?

325
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,236
Scott: Let's talk about any events that we went to.

326
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:38,080
Scott: did you go to any events?

327
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,909
Rym: We went to the keynote which everyone should go to.

328
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,943
Rym: that keynote and the omegathon finale were the only main events We actually went to.

329
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:46,067
Scott: well main events.

330
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:46,890
Scott: I mean the keynote.

331
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,449
Scott: it was a good keynote, you know, it didn't blow me away But he you know, he did talk about sort of like this.

332
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:55,860
Scott: Hey, you know gaming people you need to get over, you know this.

333
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,005
Scott: Your whole problem.

334
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:02,460
Scott: where you think that gaming is you know in the you know, it's sort of lower than anything else.

335
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,320
Scott: Just you know.

336
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,980
Scott: Just accept it and deal with it and move on and forget about it.

337
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,910
Scott: People to die.

338
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:15,300
Rym: the gamers tend to Be much like the stereotypes of gamers even at PAX as much as everyone's cool.

339
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:20,237
Rym: There is definitely that I'm a gamer dude vibe as opposed to I'm a cool dude vibe.

340
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:23,490
Scott: Yep yeah, and what he talked about?

341
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,299
Scott: he made one other point about the.

342
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:29,340
Scott: You know the fact that you shouldn't be looking down on the different kinds of games.

343
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,640
Scott: You know the game is a game is a game, right?

344
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:42,720
Scott: You know if it gets more people are playing games Even if they're playing bejeweled on the iPhone on the train, that's totally cool good and bad except I'd still I almost argue that by most definitions of game things like Farmville are not actually game now.

345
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,970
Rym: But bejeweled is but jeweled is kind of a game.

346
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,919
Scott: bejeweled is a game and Tetris is a game.

347
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:48,407
Scott: Is Tetris a game?

348
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,539
Scott: Tetris is a game and bejeweled is a game.

349
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,346
Rym: Yeah, Tetris is better game thing is.

350
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:57,117
Scott: neither of them are game theory games except in multiplayer mode because single-player is not a game It's a puzzle.

351
00:20:58,182 --> 00:21:03,125
Scott: So I'm just saying yeah, but so just say Yeah, the keynote was all right.

352
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:07,458
Scott: first Q&A, you know typical Q&A had a lot less of the.

353
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:15,560
Scott: I Think it was because he went to PAX East right that we sort of got this feeling that the Q&A was starting to get A little mushy, you know what I'm saying?

354
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:16,681
Rym: No, not at all Really

355
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:30,980
Scott: really because the Q&A I think at PAX East had a lot more mushy Sentimental stuff because there were so many people out east who had not yet already released their mushiness Right, whereas the people at PAX West had released it in many years of PAX.

356
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:35,116
Scott: So, you know the the PAX West I feel like there was.

357
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:40,760
Scott: there was a lot less You know mushy crying sort of Q&A and a lot more normal Q&A going on.

358
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,260
Rym: Yep, but there was also the fact that there are only microphones down low not up in all those balconies.

359
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:46,426
Scott: That's a ball.

360
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:47,754
Scott: The thing is at PAX East.

361
00:21:47,814 --> 00:21:51,407
Scott: It was one big Mezzanine so they were able to have microphones up there.

362
00:21:51,428 --> 00:21:54,619
Scott: You couldn't really have microphones in many tiny balconies.

363
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:57,876
Rym: But at least in our usual fashion, you know, we were doing that late show.

364
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:58,680
Rym: so we had John St.

365
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,665
Rym: John like with us.

366
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,093
Rym: he'd never been to PAX before.

367
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,200
Rym: we just like dragged him along.

368
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,366
Rym: We're like, yeah get up.

369
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:06,099
Rym: You're gonna come with us to this keynote and then there's gonna be a Q&A.

370
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:07,005
Rym: Just trust us.

371
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,000
Rym: and I think he was surprised.

372
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:13,345
Rym: He's been to like, you know bag fest other gaming cons PAX did not seem to be.

373
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:18,882
Rym: I think the high production values were an unaccustomed thing to people who go to other kinds of gaming Cons.

374
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:20,730
Scott: yeah, I mean, you know, he was probably.

375
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,700
Scott: I don't know what he was expecting when he got inside You know just a room full of people sitting with a quiet stage and the microphone on it.

376
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:36,170
Scott: But no it was news, you know They had packs 10 lights aimed at the ceiling with the video screen Hustling and the music and the craziness that makes packs so awesome.

377
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,880
Scott: That was a that was perhaps like a top five hustles.

378
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:40,467
Rym: It's one of those things were missing.

379
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:47,200
Rym: the keynote in the Q&A would not ruin my packs But that would be the worst thing you could do to diminish my packs experience.

380
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:48,060
Scott: And you know what?

381
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,700
Scott: I think that said that a lot of people their packs experience is diminished because they just couldn't get in that line.

382
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:58,480
Rym: Yeah, and especially if they don't sell those DVDs anymore How are you gonna see the keynote thing as I heard that they weren't doing the DVDs anymore?

383
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:05,968
Scott: But at their at the merch booth where we went directly after the Q&A they had the DVDs from the previous year Yeah, and from PAX East.

384
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,235
Rym: I don't know if they're gonna have them going.

385
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:08,120
Scott: I didn't see pecs.

386
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:14,153
Rym: They're not doing them anymore that they're finishing it up and stopping them.

387
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:15,497
Scott: We'll see again.

388
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:20,939
Rym: Those are just rumors Yeah, so in our usual tradition, we have to do something to mess with those guys in the Q&A.

389
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,808
Rym: I mean last year we did the action castle thing.

390
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:25,220
Rym: the year before we asked about that stupid paranoia thing.

391
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:29,859
Rym: So we got John saying John to go up and ask him if they had any bubblegum and the crowd loved it.

392
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,983
Scott: Yeah, it was alright.

393
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,951
Scott: It wasn't nearly as epic as it could have been.

394
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:37,020
Rym: Yeah bean beans an ultra-rare cocoa bean.

395
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:39,373
Scott: It was not anywhere near ultra-rare cocoa bean.

396
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:40,720
Scott: It was like it was like wax bean.

397
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:52,526
Rym: We didn't want to you know with John especially when it's someone else I don't want to tell someone else to do something long and awkward because you know the fine line between awesome and awkward Is raise our theme?

398
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:58,304
Scott: I think the best part though was when he got in that blow it out your ass line Right at the end.

399
00:23:58,324 --> 00:23:59,548
Scott: Yeah, cuz cuz.

400
00:23:59,628 --> 00:24:02,800
Scott: Mike was like Sutton Sutton and he was like blow it out your.

401
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:05,520
Rym: It was cool.

402
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:18,035
Rym: I kind of leaned into the microphone and once he started talking the Enforcer who was standing there because he was just kind of standing there ignoring everyone like setting the microphone and Once John did the voice the guy backed up and looked at him being like is that really?

403
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:19,359
Rym: is that really him?

404
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,436
Rym: Or is this just a yeah?

405
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,580
Rym: In the very least I was pleased that I got him to admit that PAX East is just bitch packs.

406
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:29,326
Scott: Yeah, that was.

407
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:31,513
Scott: we'll see how that goes over at PAX East.

408
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:32,717
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

409
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,202
Rym: Yeah, we'll see It was.

410
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:36,630
Rym: it was a an emotionally charged moment.

411
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,296
Rym: So I have to give him the benefit of the doubt.

412
00:24:38,316 --> 00:24:42,417
Scott: I Know like Mike distanced himself from those comments.

413
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:53,120
Rym: Yeah It's all you physically Thing about better royal hall though every year there's the knuckle crack and this time that guy they did it like right the fuck away.

414
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,048
Scott: Well pork fry just jumped in the line immediately.

415
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:57,840
Rym: Yeah, cuz you can't let that fly can't let that pass?

416
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:04,100
Rym: Yeah, but I feel like better royal hall added something special to the acoustics of the knuckle crack.

417
00:25:04,282 --> 00:25:05,739
Scott: I was quite an excellent knuckle crack.

418
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:12,900
Scott: Seems like there was actually less people cracking but it also seemed like each crack was amplified greatly.

419
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:19,550
Rym: I can just imagine the guy who like manages better our Hall who's like watching these nerds doing their thing Just watching that going.

420
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:20,438
Rym: What the fuck?

421
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:24,960
Rym: You know, there's no gaming or doesn't know what this is about?

422
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:28,080
Rym: I could see packs feeling like it's some sort of weird cult event.

423
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:31,820
Scott: We should maybe we should take packs DVDs because we have a couple sets, right?

424
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,714
Scott: Just show them to people who don't know and see like what they think.

425
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:37,380
Rym: should that be an event at ConnectiCon?

426
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:39,516
Rym: Show your mom what goes on?

427
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:44,153
Rym: We show ConnectiCon DVDs and like Otakon stuff and just be like.

428
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:46,100
Rym: this is what actually goes out at these cons.

429
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,185
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

430
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:49,376
Rym: I don't know we could turn that into something was it.

431
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:49,919
Scott: Maybe it could.

432
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,895
Scott: yeah I don't know what to figure that out.

433
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:58,000
Rym: Anyway, that was the last time we went into main events until the very end of the con at the Omega thon.

434
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,080
Scott: Yeah, I mean I just wasn't gonna try to run over and wait because how many hours would I have spent to wait in line?

435
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
Scott: To get into an event and then if I didn't get in good God.

436
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:12,630
Scott: Yeah, and the only things I wanted to go to other than you know The opening and the closing were the concerts and only really what.

437
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:25,575
Rym: the Saturday concerts were the only ones I was interested in and forget about it because I was much more interested in the Friday concert this year than previous years because Those concerts I like to just listen to the music but I get tired on Friday night.

438
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:26,720
Rym: I don't want to stand there.

439
00:26:27,382 --> 00:26:36,896
Rym: I really look forward to sitting down in Benariah Hall in one of those like boxes at the top just ah Maybe with the DS jam into some tunes, but I didn't want to wait.

440
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:37,940
Rym: I didn't want to get wristbands.

441
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:39,105
Scott: No, yeah, the risk.

442
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:42,540
Scott: I think that I heard that they're getting rid of wristbands entirely for now on.

443
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:44,073
Rym: I don't know how that'll go.

444
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:44,780
Scott: That's what I heard.

445
00:26:45,142 --> 00:26:52,300
Scott: I think it's actually it's kind of good because it's like look You wait in this line early in the morning so that you can be first in a line late at night.

446
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,790
Scott: It's like it totally just doesn't make sense or work out.

447
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,340
Scott: and I heard that this might just be for PAX East.

448
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:08,015
Scott: I'm not completely sure but I heard that it's definitely for PAX East no wristbands and I I suspect this might be because The bcec is so big that they can just be like open the doors.

449
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:08,477
Scott: everybody.

450
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:09,180
Scott: and who gives a shit?

451
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,227
Rym: I'm still trying to figure out what's gonna happen.

452
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:14,419
Rym: visa vs food and fucking hotels for the bcec.

453
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,866
Scott: We better get that soon.

454
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:16,891
Scott: So we don't fuck up.

455
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:18,638
Rym: It's not on the packs website.

456
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,160
Rym: yet There's that hotel by the airport.

457
00:27:21,281 --> 00:27:22,086
Rym: We could just book it.

458
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:23,414
Scott: a lot of people are like this.

459
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:24,380
Scott: you look in the packs forums.

460
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,051
Scott: A lot of people are getting hotels and things or discussing.

461
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:28,898
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing official yet.

462
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,532
Scott: So What they say?

463
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:31,220
Rym: I'm worried.

464
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,540
Rym: I'm a little worried about that because part of the energy of packs is going in and out hanging out like a pax prime.

465
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,231
Rym: We got that one bodega that had a line out the door.

466
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:41,400
Rym: The guy had to close it to go like smoke a cigarette.

467
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:42,845
Scott: Yeah, that was that.

468
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:51,871
Scott: I walked up and he was like, yeah, I'm opening in a few minutes and I'm like, yeah not buying anything See ya Man, so Friday besides doing that and playing games.

469
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:53,457
Scott: It was pretty much just late show, right?

470
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:54,380
Rym: Yeah, we did the late show.

471
00:27:54,761 --> 00:28:02,149
Rym: I got to give the huge shout out again to Robert Greg heel Matt Graham these guys And girl Molly made it happen for us.

472
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,558
Rym: We we kind of bombed the first half.

473
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,089
Scott: Yeah I mean, I'm not gonna.

474
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:07,140
Scott: you know, we don't get a lie.

475
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:10,500
Scott: We're not someone who's the kind of people who say we did awesome when we didn't do awesome.

476
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:15,159
Scott: The late show is not nearly as good as he wanted it to be or imagined it to be.

477
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,923
Rym: Where's your teeth?

478
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:19,460
Rym: caught us a little off guard and we did not recover eloquently or adequately.

479
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,460
Scott: Yeah, and we're not the types to blame others either, you know, we should have if we're making a late show, right?

480
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:26,248
Scott: You know, it's like if we.

481
00:28:26,932 --> 00:28:31,333
Scott: I felt I mean it was my mistake I felt all along that we had too many guests, but I didn't say anything.

482
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:34,731
Scott: right, you know We could have definitely removed a guest.

483
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:36,140
Scott: I think it would have made the show a lot better.

484
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,422
Scott: well all people in Retrospect.

485
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:43,086
Rym: Luke Burge gave us the best advice at all cuz he pointed out that whenever you're doing a live thing That isn't a controlled lecture.

486
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:45,554
Rym: because he made me realize something about our content.

487
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:49,126
Rym: at packs and panels at conventions We really control the environment.

488
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:49,828
Rym: Look at our panels.

489
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:53,840
Rym: We lie and say we're gonna take questions and then we almost never take questions.

490
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,379
Rym: We don't let anyone the audience talk.

491
00:28:55,661 --> 00:29:00,920
Rym: We control the narrative from start to finish like we make sure that nothing can get in our way.

492
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:08,831
Rym: But us when we got guests on the show or something could go wrong and there's more than one person on stage You have to have a plan for disaster.

493
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:09,615
Scott: Yep.

494
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:10,780
Rym: I think we had no plan.

495
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,458
Rym: So when something goes wrong, we'd have the sideways glance at each other.

496
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:27,120
Rym: But there's no way short of saying I got this to say I got this Yeah, and you can look up at the camera or the audience or the tech crew and every like every heartbeat.

497
00:29:27,261 --> 00:29:30,800
Rym: It's just like awkward meter going up and up and up by a million.

498
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:32,486
Rym: So at least you know.

499
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:38,819
Rym: Molly saved us with her awesome set and then for the second half We decided to change it up to see if we could you know salvage it.

500
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:41,371
Rym: So we jumped on the couch with Alex Albrecht and John St.

501
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:43,844
Rym: John and the second half is pretty badass I think.

502
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,654
Rym: I think we pulled it off.

503
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:45,584
Scott: It was alright I think.

504
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:49,890
Scott: just imagine what the show would have been though If it was like Alex Albrecht then Molly then John St.

505
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:55,715
Scott: John at the end or Swit, you know either any order Right if we minus the roosterteeth guys, it would have been a good show.

506
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:56,680
Scott: I think much better.

507
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,180
Scott: Anyway, I think the one thing that we do need to do is that when we get on stage for doing a panel, right?

508
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,600
Scott: we have a topic and we're talking about the topic and It's something we care about or know about or both and we just go off and it works.

509
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:25,367
Scott: but when you're doing a late show a lot of the talk we have to do is like introducing somebody or Milling about while someone shuffles around behind stage and we need to have things not necessarily Completely scripted but more scripted

510
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:29,920
Rym: fast forward fast backward to a conversation like six months ago.

511
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:32,313
Rym: Hey, we need to write like a bit for the opening now.

512
00:30:32,354 --> 00:30:33,178
Rym: Let's just wing it.

513
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,113
Scott: Well, cuz I I learned a lesson.

514
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:37,922
Scott: it was a lesson learned But

515
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:47,964
Rym: suffice it to say despite all the like trying to prep prepare for this thing The set that they that they had for us in the camera like it was amazing Pulled through

516
00:30:48,004 --> 00:30:54,136
Scott: for us and there was no failure at any part you know of any enforcers or any of our tech guys or anybody.

517
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:57,987
Scott: they were awesome and Thanks to them sadly.

518
00:30:58,047 --> 00:31:01,419
Rym: They've got the video up from the first half, but the video from the second half is not done yet.

519
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,869
Rym: Ah, so the better part is not.

520
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:08,053
Rym: a thing is right in which we kind of screwed him by, you know We realized like alright, we're bombing.

521
00:31:08,073 --> 00:31:08,739
Rym: we got to fix this.

522
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:14,726
Rym: So we changed it up and we sat on the couch instead of at the desk and then they had to like scramble and change All the cameras around.

523
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:15,188
Rym: Yeah.

524
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:17,820
Scott: Oh, I didn't even realize that that would be a problem.

525
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,331
Scott: I didn't even realize that they would run out of film either like they were.

526
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:22,681
Scott: you know that we pulled it off and fit within The.

527
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:27,260
Scott: you know, the you had like an extra digital tape lying around but I didn't even realize that that was an issue.

528
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,920
Scott: You know, there's a lot of things that we just did not know.

529
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,053
Rym: Well, you know, we're good at live and we're good at audio video.

530
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:34,856
Scott: We've got a lot to.

531
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:36,120
Scott: we have no video skills.

532
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:37,592
Rym: I guess T is gonna fix that.

533
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:38,440
Rym: hopefully hopefully.

534
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:51,466
Scott: But yeah, we if we if we if they let us do this again and I would not blame them for not letting us If they were our skills will improve every time and there's no way to improve them without failing though We didn't realize we had an idea.

535
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:52,692
Rym: and actually John St.

536
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:54,380
Rym: John we were talking about he was like really?

537
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,290
Rym: Holy shit, if you guys do it at least I'll fucking do it at West.

538
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:00,342
Rym: but you know what all those anime cons do that match Game.

539
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:02,738
Rym: Yeah, we've got that thing down to a fucking science.

540
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:05,190
Scott: Yes So I was like, yeah We should do the match game at PAX.

541
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:09,618
Scott: and he was like, oh man And he was like I. she said he said he should host it.

542
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,147
Scott: and I was like Oh because I was thinking he'd just be a panelist.

543
00:32:12,168 --> 00:32:13,753
Rym: but then I realized that John St.

544
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:14,476
Rym: John he's like.

545
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:14,857
Scott: he's like.

546
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:18,412
Rym: that's my thing He and the fact is he's a fan of the old match game.

547
00:32:18,452 --> 00:32:20,200
Rym: like we are he could do the voice.

548
00:32:20,442 --> 00:32:22,737
Rym: He's even making jokes about that stick microphone.

549
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:27,339
Scott: Oh, yeah He we need to get a match game at PAX hosted by John St.

550
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:33,118
Rym: John And we had a long conversation with him about Bob Barker just unrelatedly who used the same stick microphone.

551
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:34,604
Scott: Yeah That's the.

552
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:39,628
Scott: you know, the game show host microphone is yeah, we should get 70s game show host microphone.

553
00:32:39,648 --> 00:32:40,452
Scott: They still use those today.

554
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:42,120
Rym: I could get one that I found him.

555
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,406
Rym: I was so after packs, right?

556
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:47,094
Rym: I found some of those on Craigslist.

557
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:49,140
Rym: how much like a hundred bucks get one.

558
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:50,025
Rym: I'm thinking about it.

559
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:51,012
Scott: I could totally use it.

560
00:32:51,032 --> 00:32:52,199
Scott: We could do a game show in the house.

561
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:53,919
Rym: They're not that good a microphone.

562
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:57,956
Rym: You're better had to be that modern day or better off with the lobs unless you're trying to 70s it up.

563
00:32:59,003 --> 00:33:00,040
Rym: I could wear that red blazer.

564
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,464
Rym: We could.

565
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:04,919
Scott: we could use a different microphone of the actual audio and then just hold it.

566
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,434
Rym: Anyway, they remember that at the blade show.

567
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,280
Rym: that was the one thing we're like.

568
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:12,039
Rym: Oh, we don't have a fake microphone to put on the desk?

569
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:16,192
Rym: No, and then we realized we should had a real microphone as the backup mic.

570
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:16,734
Scott: Yeah.

571
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:19,785
Scott: Oh, well, so yeah We did the late show.

572
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:31,160
Scott: it was okay below expectations But we did it and we can say we did it and that's you know, yep Well, I think it was the biggest thing we've ever bitten off and I think it was the worst we've ever failed live.

573
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:34,256
Rym: So if that's the worst we ever do, I think we're doing okay.

574
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:34,940
Scott: We're doing all right.

575
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:38,820
Rym: Well, I guess not counting our very first panel ever.

576
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:40,445
Scott: That wasn't so bad.

577
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:41,430
Rym: Ohio con.

578
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,178
Scott: I don't even remember that was bad in the late show.

579
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:46,758
Rym: Well, we didn't have any guests that's true.

580
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,489
Rym: There was that one sad match game at the con.

581
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:53,417
Rym: that didn't give us any guests or any equipment.

582
00:33:53,718 --> 00:33:59,445
Scott: Yeah So Saturday, I know before the late show actually while we were waiting for it There was the like a girls.

583
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:00,590
Scott: and did you see any of that?

584
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:02,317
Scott: It was like it was like an IGN.

585
00:34:02,337 --> 00:34:04,046
Scott: Oh Right.

586
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,454
Rym: We saw that it was all like IGN.

587
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:06,319
Rym: female game journalist.

588
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:13,954
Rym: now I'm sorry to all of you who are on that panel, but I'm going to diss you And I hope I hope that you know people.

589
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:15,320
Scott: this will be an easy.

590
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:21,920
Scott: We'll make ourselves an easy mark to be called sexist by making fun of the game during the female game journalists panel.

591
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:29,837
Scott: But you just got to be honest, you know, if you think it's sexist to be honest well, that's your problem, but the thing is you will not think we're sexist when we say this.

592
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:38,137
Rym: and We only saw the end of the panel I saw like the last 10-15 minutes, but half of what we said seemed to boil down to.

593
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:40,224
Rym: you know We're girl gamers.

594
00:34:40,504 --> 00:34:41,567
Rym: Don't objectify us.

595
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:44,775
Rym: Don't think that we know less than all the guy gamers.

596
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,000
Rym: Don't look down on our knowledge.

597
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:53,255
Rym: So statement the first and Scott and I both agree You didn't know what the fuck you were talking about about half the games you tried to say things about.

598
00:34:53,395 --> 00:35:02,220
Rym: but to be fair You were correct in saying that you are not any less capable than the male journalist in the video game industry.

599
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:12,660
Scott: Yeah at IGN if there's anything I learned right because on Saturday right before our game mechanics and mechanism design panel There was a a male game journalist panel that had big names.

600
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:17,480
Scott: Yeah, like a guy crow and guy crow and Steven to Tilla who we saw at the Y who is that guy in the middle?

601
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,672
Rym: I didn't look it up because he was the only one who seemed to know he was.

602
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:24,147
Scott: there was only one guy in that panel Who knew what the fuck you talking about?

603
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,780
Rym: We got to clarify that too and guy crow didn't say much.

604
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,944
Rym: That's true while we were there.

605
00:35:28,004 --> 00:35:28,566
Rym: So I don't know.

606
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:29,449
Scott: thing is right.

607
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:32,360
Scott: There's other evidence for example to Tillo, right?

608
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:39,199
Scott: We know for a fact because after we did the y+30 thing He made a post which I talked to him briefly about about how he'd never played doom.

609
00:35:39,782 --> 00:35:45,240
Scott: He was a game journalist on MTV for all those years and with Kotaku for all those years never played.

610
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,019
Rym: My name's Roger Ebert.

611
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:50,055
Rym: I've never seen Susan Cain.

612
00:35:50,076 --> 00:35:57,400
Scott: Casablanca Crow admitted long ago that he started gaming in the PlayStation era and he did not really had not played many of the old games.

613
00:35:58,004 --> 00:36:00,020
Scott: It's okay to grow up in a newer era.

614
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:05,787
Scott: I mean I was born in the 80s, but if I'm gonna be a film critic I better have seen the fucking movies from before.

615
00:36:05,828 --> 00:36:07,493
Scott: I was born before my time.

616
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,499
Scott: Otherwise, I need to shut the fuck up.

617
00:36:10,122 --> 00:36:13,437
Rym: Yeah, but I think what got me was the technical stuff too.

618
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:19,600
Rym: at one point They were trying to list like the 10 greatest games of all time, which is be that was what the panel was about.

619
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:21,989
Rym: You got to clarify greatest most influential.

620
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:23,273
Rym: Like what do you what are you talking about?

621
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,160
Rym: Best game most popular game?

622
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,344
Rym: Those are two very different things.

623
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:27,768
Rym: Yep sales what?

624
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:28,570
Rym: so whatever?

625
00:36:29,032 --> 00:36:30,175
Rym: obviously we're ragging on them.

626
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,318
Rym: big targets for ourselves.

627
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:31,700
Rym: Here we go.

628
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:37,160
Rym: Yeah, but at one point I won't say who but one of them says something to the effect of counter-strike.

629
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,608
Rym: That was a really important game.

630
00:36:38,648 --> 00:36:40,680
Rym: It was the first game where when you died, you're dead.

631
00:36:41,021 --> 00:36:43,729
Rym: It was the first game with like the weapon buying mechanic.

632
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:50,869
Rym: It was like this asymmetric versus game FPS Realism and he was just wrong.

633
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:51,993
Rym: He was straight-up wrong.

634
00:36:52,094 --> 00:36:56,286
Rym: action-quake - I mean And I pointed it out to him.

635
00:36:56,306 --> 00:36:59,460
Rym: He was like, yeah, I don't know anything about action-quake - then you should shut the fuck up.

636
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,826
Scott: What kind of game journalists are you?

637
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:01,731
Scott: you're you're you're.

638
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:06,974
Scott: you are like, you know Judging and critiquing video games writing journalists.

639
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:08,280
Scott: You call yourself a journalist.

640
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:11,253
Scott: You're writing about video games and you know less than me.

641
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:12,820
Scott: I don't even call myself a journalist.

642
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:26,767
Scott: I'm just yelling on some podcast and the fact is those girl game journalists from IGN Knew just as much about games as those guy game journalists in that panel Except the one guy who knew what he was talking about who we'll talk about in a second Which is not a lot right?

643
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:37,297
Scott: They were all pretty much complete, you know from my perspective They knew a lot less about games than I did and if I was hiring game journalists I wouldn't hire any of them except for the one guy the one guy who was smart.

644
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:37,820
Scott: basically.

645
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,140
Rym: This guy came out at the guy in the middle the blonde guy with the kind of like fuzzy hair.

646
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,288
Scott: Yeah, he ran out of the panel.

647
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:43,932
Scott: I couldn't even get.

648
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:44,718
Rym: I walked up.

649
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:50,260
Rym: cuz you know We've we've had panelist badges our panels next to say hi and the dude literally like he was talking to someone.

650
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:52,411
Rym: I turned my back to like say something to to Tillo.

651
00:37:52,713 --> 00:37:54,020
Rym: I turned around again guys gone.

652
00:37:54,261 --> 00:37:55,869
Rym: Yeah, like not in the room anymore.

653
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:04,925
Rym: But anyway, that guy remember later We're in the elevator and the hotel and we saw someone looked exactly like that guy and I'm like, hey Talk about your panel.

654
00:38:04,945 --> 00:38:05,729
Rym: He's like what panel?

655
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:07,820
Rym: he wasn't the guy but then he knew who we were.

656
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:19,760
Scott: It was really weird Anyway, but anyway this guy he bumped adventure off the list cuz some moron put it on the list I don't know why and he put on DDR and he was like spot-on with that, you know.

657
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,492
Rym: And not just that but pretty much every word that came out of his mouth in that panel Contradicted someone else on the panel and was correct.

658
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:27,617
Scott: That's right there.

659
00:38:27,677 --> 00:38:31,811
Scott: That's enough You know judging from those 15 minutes of hearing these people.

660
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:32,934
Scott: He was smart.

661
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:33,656
Scott: Everyone else was dumb.

662
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:34,760
Rym: not smart and dumb.

663
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,804
Rym: It's just now.

664
00:38:35,844 --> 00:38:44,178
Rym: when it comes to games and this is said a lot it's weird, but no one does anything about it I feel like video game journalism because the video game fans know even less.

665
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:50,156
Scott: you heard though You saw those people walking up being like how come like Call of Duty isn't on there or whatever.

666
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:54,580
Scott: It's like oh my god This is the top 10 games of all time.

667
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:06,153
Scott: I mean, I understand that you like Call of Duty and it's very popular and pooping is good, but top 10 Not even top 50 dude, seriously Anyway, so this it was funny cuz I think.

668
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:07,320
Rym: video at the girls panel.

669
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:16,764
Rym: I hope we didn't disrupt anything because when Scott said the effect of no, they're not wrong They know just as much as the gay of the guys at IGN I like.

670
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:19,180
Rym: I laughed so hard like I felt like I was gonna disrupt the panel.

671
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:22,920
Rym: So, I'm sorry if you heard me and I'm sorry that we're dissing you guys so much.

672
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:28,036
Scott: But the funniest part about that girl panel was when one of them was like, you know, we shouldn't be.

673
00:39:28,056 --> 00:39:34,140
Scott: you know Someday we won't be like, you know getting bikini pictures and other girls like, you know, I've done lots of bikini pictures.

674
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,706
Scott: You know, I'm just you got to pay the bills.

675
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:37,051
Scott: All right, that's how things work.

676
00:39:37,171 --> 00:39:39,480
Rym: How come I can't get paid bikini pictures?

677
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:43,040
Scott: I don't know, but I felt guy crawl in a bikini.

678
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,920
Scott: I felt that there was contention on the panel on that issue.

679
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:51,419
Scott: There was totally tension on that pad and also hypocrisy at the same time and it was awkward.

680
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:54,895
Scott: But also I wish the girls would have done the panel in bikinis.

681
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:56,662
Scott: That was the only sexist thing I've said.

682
00:39:56,883 --> 00:40:00,820
Rym: I wish I wish all video game journalists did their panels in bikinis.

683
00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:01,905
Scott: It would.

684
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:04,757
Rym: yeah, it would definitely I'd love to see an guy crawl in a bikini.

685
00:40:04,918 --> 00:40:05,280
Scott: No, you don't.

686
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:08,263
Rym: So I'm.

687
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:13,259
Rym: the video game industry has shit journalism and that we got to do something about this.

688
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,483
Rym: We're no we're not great But we're not a.

689
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:28,174
Scott: people have been complaining about shitty video game journalism for years and is and you know What even the shitty game journalists are complaining about shitty video game journalism and there's nothing we can do about it Except keep doing this podcast or our project st.

690
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:28,856
Scott: Oh, no.

691
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:29,478
Scott: Oh shit.

692
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:30,960
Scott: Oh shit anyway.

693
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:35,932
Scott: So, yeah, we those are the two panels that happen before our panels.

694
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:36,895
Scott: then we did them.

695
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:38,100
Scott: we did the game theory mechanism.

696
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:47,620
Rym: I don't think this time to talk about our panels because while we didn't do so well in the late show I feel like game mechanics and mechanism design we hit that one out of the fucking park.

697
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:49,328
Scott: You know who wrote that panel?

698
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,056
Rym: Uh, you did that's right.

699
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:51,860
Rym: Yeah, it was a good panel.

700
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,924
Scott: Yeah, no all the panels.

701
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:55,112
Scott: I'm writing lately a plus panels.

702
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:57,020
Scott: You're writing lately a minus.

703
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,129
Rym: Well depends on which panel I got my out.

704
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:02,445
Rym: my music panel for the anime cons is really good Regis.

705
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:04,780
Rym: the problem was I had to rewrite the whole second pass.

706
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,313
Rym: I have the panel at the con when we notice stuff at the con.

707
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,260
Rym: Mmm, but I got an idea.

708
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,583
Rym: So I'm splitting egregious into a new panel and we got this crazy idea I want to.

709
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:18,020
Scott: I want to try to get the Miku panel at magfest because it is music related.

710
00:41:18,782 --> 00:41:23,678
Rym: Yeah, I proposed that and the anime openers panel both of them just to see what they want.

711
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:24,902
Rym: mmm We'll see.

712
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:28,938
Rym: we're probably gonna do two or so panels at magfest, but that's neither here nor there.

713
00:41:28,978 --> 00:41:29,440
Scott: would it be?

714
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:37,739
Scott: Unprofessional to go to the New York Comic Con with our one panel and do a different panel than the one we're scheduled to do?

715
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,423
Rym: That would be interesting I don't.

716
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:47,539
Rym: the thing is that the title and description of the panel for New York Comic Con that I gave them is pretty damn generic.

717
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:48,664
Scott: We'll see.

718
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:51,180
Scott: Let's let's work within those bounds and push it pretty far.

719
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,894
Rym: We only have to talk about anime that people didn't think they'd like.

720
00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:56,280
Rym: that's pretty damn vague.

721
00:41:56,622 --> 00:42:03,186
Scott: All right, we could talk about shitty anime that you really won't like alright, so Game mechanics mechanism design.

722
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:10,697
Rym: when we did this panel and it's funny because I have two questions that we took at the end were about The panel as opposed to like this meta stuff.

723
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:23,600
Scott: Yeah, I know I put up Scott's rules of question asking which which a deleted a lot of question asking time, which is Purposeful, but then the question that you see it didn't actually violate any of your rules because everyone was really interested in the answer.

724
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:24,483
Scott: That's true.

725
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,369
Scott: Yeah, but it was still off topic.

726
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:28,897
Scott: It wasn't about the you know, it was about the panel.

727
00:42:29,398 --> 00:42:29,880
Scott: It was meta.

728
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,587
Rym: It wasn't on but you didn't say no meta.

729
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:32,230
Scott: It had to.

730
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:33,255
Rym: you've got to add another.

731
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:34,420
Scott: it needs to be about.

732
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:35,828
Scott: You know the topic of the panel.

733
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:38,100
Rym: Yes, you have to write another really about the panel.

734
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,886
Rym: You have to make a rule.

735
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:40,880
Scott: that doesn't need to be a rule.

736
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,888
Scott: It's already part of the on topic rule.

737
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:48,239
Rym: now because I'm interpreting the on topic rule too broadly I would argue that everyone interpreted that way.

738
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:51,589
Scott: Only one guy asked about the panel, but

739
00:42:52,051 --> 00:43:07,443
Rym: the panel was enough that at least one unnamed studio Apparently the previous year a big game studio one of their employees saw one of our panels I think it was beyond D&D beyond Candyland and they told other people at this company to come to this panel this year and Then we were talking to them.

740
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:09,952
Rym: They're totally cool dudes and we learned some stuff.

741
00:43:09,992 --> 00:43:14,348
Rym: there are some about some big games Not new upcoming games, but old games.

742
00:43:14,368 --> 00:43:17,820
Scott: They didn't tell us anything secret because they were very good at secret-keeping.

743
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,080
Rym: But it was interesting to talk to them and we might have cool things to be doing with them in the future.

744
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,080
Rym: Oh, that was very kind of touching and cool that that happened.

745
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,379
Scott: Yeah They also told us about some other games that they don't even make that they thought were cool that we like.

746
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:33,613
Scott: For example Uniwar is a really good iPhone game.

747
00:43:33,634 --> 00:43:35,904
Scott: if you like advanced wars with hexes Oh my god that.

748
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:39,039
Rym: and I'm getting real close to the end of my sprint contract.

749
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:41,051
Scott: Civ 5 comes out a week from today.

750
00:43:41,273 --> 00:43:41,816
Rym: Oh fuck.

751
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,625
Scott: No Tuesday, so today's Thursday.

752
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:45,207
Rym: Oh fuck.

753
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:47,515
Rym: Yeah, that's like countdown to the end of my life.

754
00:43:47,857 --> 00:43:48,740
Scott: All right, so five days.

755
00:43:49,582 --> 00:43:55,000
Rym: But we really like we hit this one out of the park Like the audience was on the edge of their of their seats the entire late show.

756
00:43:55,141 --> 00:44:01,700
Scott: The room was emptying as we did a late show But as we did the game theory making the design panel the room was filling as we did the panel.

757
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,370
Scott: That's how you know, it's good when it fills.

758
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:04,980
Rym: It was very hard to get away.

759
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,496
Rym: We had to basically tell everyone to get out of the room and

760
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:12,882
Scott: I Left a whole bunch of stuff behind because I had to get out because the next panel was setting up Yeah,

761
00:44:12,922 --> 00:44:17,844
Rym: and I was trying to leave the room and we were basically mobbed by people for the rest of the night as a result Of this panel.

762
00:44:17,884 --> 00:44:19,513
Scott: Yeah, and for the rest of the con.

763
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:22,960
Scott: no one came up and told us Oh, man, your late show was awesome or anything like that.

764
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,603
Scott: They just told us.

765
00:44:23,845 --> 00:44:28,126
Scott: they kept telling us that our game theory make the design panel was awesome You know and they saw it.

766
00:44:28,246 --> 00:44:29,171
Scott: So that was totally sweet.

767
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:34,677
Scott: So don't worry We need to get our quality panel on Friday instead of Saturday next time.

768
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:35,460
Scott: that's all I want.

769
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,817
Scott: Let's just put our best panel on Friday at like noon or one.

770
00:44:39,937 --> 00:44:40,660
Scott: That's all I want.

771
00:44:40,901 --> 00:44:44,780
Scott: Well, even if we only do one panel, let's do that.

772
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:55,945
Rym: We are very likely at PAX East this upcoming year doing that panel again and either this obviously got to do that panel again Yeah, and either the sequel to it or the triple threat Maybe both.

773
00:44:56,005 --> 00:44:56,266
Rym: we'll see.

774
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:59,480
Scott: we can't do a sequel to a panel at the same con as the prequel.

775
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:01,875
Rym: I think you can because they're two standalone panels.

776
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:05,714
Scott: now We should do something else as the other panel now because it's just.

777
00:45:05,794 --> 00:45:15,516
Rym: we're not calling it as an equal It's not actually a sequel It just it Covers all the things that people went to the first panel had questions about and it's basically its own panel.

778
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:16,520
Scott: Whatever anyway.

779
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:21,000
Scott: So then we did the very last panel of the whole con.

780
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,640
Rym: We did egregiously unrealized our last panel the cons last panel.

781
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:32,673
Scott: Literally this panel ended and then immediately after the omega-thon finale began And we got to thank Aaron see again for helping us get into the omega.

782
00:45:32,753 --> 00:45:42,900
Rym: Oh my god, basically now we finish the panel We tell everyone all right, we're out of here We run Aaron gets us and he puts us up in the VIP box and then immediately the omega-thon finale starts.

783
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,031
Scott: That was the best I did it.

784
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:46,820
Rym: I don't know what I would have done if I didn't make it.

785
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,119
Rym: That was crazy, but I was very surprised that a lot of people came to that panel.

786
00:45:51,643 --> 00:45:54,160
Rym: It seemed like about half of them came because they saw the other panel.

787
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:56,400
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people there were repeat people.

788
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:57,866
Scott: I knew that they were at the other panel.

789
00:45:57,906 --> 00:46:06,053
Scott: a lot of people just couldn't get an end to the omega-thon finale didn't want to bother or you know, whatever You know, it was in a smaller room the Raven theater.

790
00:46:06,094 --> 00:46:07,080
Scott: It was so late in the con.

791
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:07,564
Scott: I think that's.

792
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:09,360
Scott: another thing is the timing is very important.

793
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,260
Scott: You know the timing of our game theory mechanism sign panel had a very good timing, right?

794
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,512
Scott: But the late show I didn't realize how much packs clears out at night.

795
00:46:17,592 --> 00:46:23,289
Scott: it empties right and also Except tabletop except tabletop and also the.

796
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:27,419
Scott: you know, the packs also empties, you know around towards the end.

797
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:31,999
Scott: there You know, if you're not going to the closing ceremonies, there's only one panel and everything else is starting to shut down.

798
00:46:32,502 --> 00:46:38,268
Scott: So there weren't too many people around to go to our Egregiously unrealized potential panel.

799
00:46:38,288 --> 00:46:39,995
Scott: So the number that showed up was pretty impressive.

800
00:46:40,015 --> 00:46:41,220
Rym: Yeah, we almost filled the room.

801
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,553
Rym: There were only like 20 seats in the back that weren't filled.

802
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,004
Rym: Yeah, it was pretty good And it was more.

803
00:46:46,024 --> 00:46:48,858
Rym: it was definitely more of a us ranting about games.

804
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:58,099
Scott: Yeah I think the educational panels are definitely way better and inspiring but the you know A ranting panel can be alright as long as you don't do too many of them, you know or rent too much.

805
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:02,375
Rym: Yeah, we can use the fine line because sometimes the pure entertainment panel is good.

806
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:05,320
Scott: Yeah, it's good It's just you know, it's not amazing.

807
00:47:05,362 --> 00:47:13,645
Rym: well the thing is if you want to bowl people over you have to do the Amazing panel where people feel enlightened or you have to go all out and do the uncle yo Like I am doing.

808
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:14,168
Rym: doing.

809
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,519
Scott: doing the rant panel is more like playing the woo game.

810
00:47:16,941 --> 00:47:19,211
Scott: Right, cuz it's like I have this gripe.

811
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:19,693
Scott: Whoo.

812
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:20,818
Scott: I agree boo.

813
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:25,172
Rym: I disagree Yeah, and that's you know, of course by talking about the woo game.

814
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:26,757
Rym: We got people to not play the woo game.

815
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:27,829
Rym: Very good Yeah.

816
00:47:28,461 --> 00:47:34,357
Rym: And also I don't think anyone had really considered the potential of a Pokemon MMO.

817
00:47:34,678 --> 00:47:35,360
Rym: like no one in the room.

818
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,819
Rym: They're like, all right, where they going with this where they going with this where they going with this.

819
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:43,080
Rym: Then we were like Pokemon MMO and they were like, oh shit change the world destroy the world.

820
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,900
Scott: That's the I mean Civ 5 poop on a stick compared to Pokemon MMO.

821
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:51,375
Rym: Yeah, Pokemon MMO is one of the only things that could possibly pull me away from natural selection.

822
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:52,960
Scott: 3 tribes 3.

823
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:00,414
Scott: Yeah, can't beat Pokemon MMO Even if it's a stupid grinding game that I hate and I will hate it.

824
00:48:00,535 --> 00:48:00,956
Scott: I'll play it.

825
00:48:00,996 --> 00:48:01,920
Rym: Anyway, this is Pokemon.

826
00:48:02,121 --> 00:48:04,158
Scott: It's the goddamn Pokemon MMO.

827
00:48:06,205 --> 00:48:07,218
Scott: I'll pay monthly fee.

828
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:11,779
Rym: So the Omega thon finale was off the hook.

829
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,480
Scott: now The thing is I have never successfully predicted the Omega thon finale, right?

830
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,974
Scott: I mean the closest I came was when it was skee-ball right after they revealed it.

831
00:48:20,014 --> 00:48:21,280
Scott: I was like I should have known.

832
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:25,040
Scott: Right, it felt like it was on the tip of your tongue kind of situation.

833
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:29,220
Scott: But in fact the Megathon finale this year I had predicted a year in advance.

834
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:31,800
Scott: However, you went actually wrong one.

835
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,503
Scott: That's like betting.

836
00:48:32,563 --> 00:48:36,780
Rym: I like I bet that the Mets are gonna win this year and they lose and they win the next year.

837
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,141
Scott: Right.

838
00:48:37,342 --> 00:48:47,420
Scott: and then when we were actually sitting and we actually sat down or waiting for the curtains to open and reveal The the game I couldn't think of a goddamn game and save my life.

839
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,067
Scott: It was just a drawing a total blank.

840
00:48:49,247 --> 00:48:50,894
Rym: and then he's like, it's an old.

841
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:52,300
Rym: he gave three clues.

842
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:54,054
Scott: He said the game was ancient.

843
00:48:55,544 --> 00:48:55,825
Scott: Right.

844
00:48:55,905 --> 00:48:56,307
Scott: Okay.

845
00:48:56,488 --> 00:48:58,456
Scott: I was trying to source man.

846
00:48:58,537 --> 00:49:03,480
Scott: It was so gather It was a it was a turn-taking game and it was a resource gathering game.

847
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:09,032
Scott: And as soon as he said resource gathering game I knew that it was the crane.

848
00:49:09,052 --> 00:49:11,680
Scott: and I said it's the crane.

849
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:22,165
Scott: And when he opened the curtain behold the Omega crane This was definitely the best I had guessed it correct with like five seconds before finale.

850
00:49:22,406 --> 00:49:25,318
Rym: to date it the the the fact had the little microphone.

851
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:27,546
Rym: you heard the individual quarters going in it.

852
00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:40,104
Scott: that was that was whoever whichever tech guy was so smart to put a Microphone near the coin slot and to put a microphone near the speaker that played the carnival music and then like they had these prepared Jokes, but they pulled them off.

853
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:45,540
Scott: So effortlessly like Tyka Tyka was like we have these quarters in our pockets much like your father.

854
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:48,066
Rym: And then complicated world.

855
00:49:48,146 --> 00:49:50,214
Scott: and then every time the machine didn't work is like it.

856
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:51,819
Scott: the world is a complicated place.

857
00:49:53,565 --> 00:50:03,487
Rym: But it was amazing especially it might have been Benaroya Hall that added to the air of excitement because it was silent and you just hear the movements and Then the crowd would just lose their shit every.

858
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:09,562
Scott: and they filled the crane with the most amazing stuffed animals from various video game TV.

859
00:50:09,602 --> 00:50:23,133
Scott: yeah, of course Robert who was the only one who could pull out two toys with one crane press Sadly one of the Omega knots as is every omega-thon finale He was hopelessly outmatched, but was it really skill?

860
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:25,180
Scott: or you know, I mean, I think it was skill.

861
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,328
Rym: He kept going for some things.

862
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:27,840
Rym: He shouldn't have gone for it's true.

863
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:31,680
Scott: I mean look how many turns by when no one went for the lying sideways.

864
00:50:32,883 --> 00:50:34,439
Scott: Kingdom Hearts guy, right?

865
00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:37,716
Scott: They pulled it out and it was laying sideways but no one went for it.

866
00:50:37,756 --> 00:50:41,875
Scott: after all those turns They'll eventually they went like didn't Mike pull it out in the end.

867
00:50:41,935 --> 00:50:42,719
Scott: I think right?

868
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:43,761
Scott: Whatever.

869
00:50:44,143 --> 00:50:54,320
Scott: The point was that they made the crane so epic, you know, even though you know Until the point where one guy was dominating it was so tense because like they would pull it's moving.

870
00:50:54,421 --> 00:50:56,880
Scott: He's got it lifted in the crane and then he drops it.

871
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:03,180
Rym: Ah, and just the magnitude of the crowd reaction was it was actually kind of overpowering.

872
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:04,286
Scott: I have an idea.

873
00:51:04,326 --> 00:51:06,500
Scott: We need an ARP, you know how dread uses Jenga set.

874
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,759
Scott: We need an RPG that uses the crane game uses the crane game.

875
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:17,460
Rym: Also, I know for the first time ever zero technical problems started immediately.

876
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:19,436
Scott: I think a crane right.

877
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:19,960
Scott: they had notice.

878
00:51:20,081 --> 00:51:23,780
Scott: It was a brand new crane machine that they had restyled to be the Omega crane.

879
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,671
Scott: It was not an old skeeball machine.

880
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:31,215
Scott: It was not an old Famicom right from Japan with a disk system, right?

881
00:51:31,537 --> 00:51:38,060
Scott: It was not Four separate Nintendo some of which weren't actual Nintendo's with different cartridges lined up in a row.

882
00:51:38,441 --> 00:51:43,100
Scott: This was something that had a very low chance of failure seeing it was a brand new machine.

883
00:51:43,481 --> 00:51:44,686
Scott: They set it up on time.

884
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:45,630
Scott: You know, it was.

885
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:46,373
Scott: it was good to go.

886
00:51:46,393 --> 00:51:48,060
Scott: It had extensive testing, right?

887
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:59,080
Scott: I hope that in the future They will also do the same thing and not use incredibly old technology to run the omegathon finale Instead opt for things such as emulation.

888
00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:04,000
Rym: I really want the omegathon finale to be like nerf fencing or something.

889
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:10,323
Scott: I want it to be one of those electro mechanical games much like you see in the retro arcade museum Huh?

890
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:12,695
Rym: Wonder if we could try to perhaps a gun game.

891
00:52:12,715 --> 00:52:14,606
Rym: Ah It's shooting.

892
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:22,940
Scott: Here are two clocks or perhaps pinball The oldest variety.

893
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:26,211
Rym: Remember the trouble is you don't necessarily want a good game.

894
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:28,740
Rym: You want a game where the reveal itself will have the crowd go.

895
00:52:28,863 --> 00:52:29,277
Rym: Oh shit.

896
00:52:31,953 --> 00:52:37,360
Rym: Ping-pong has well other Table tennis again the other fatal flaw.

897
00:52:38,043 --> 00:52:47,320
Rym: You can't use a game where someone who has some amount of skill Will completely and without question dominate the other guy like if it was a ping-pong thing.

898
00:52:47,861 --> 00:52:52,375
Rym: Someone who has played ping-pong before will just win completely against someone who is not.

899
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:55,225
Rym: Yep, like there is no chance I think that's why.

900
00:52:55,285 --> 00:53:01,547
Scott: but even when they went with a come basically sort of a random game like the crane It's still one person dominated.

901
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:06,260
Rym: because their skill and the omegathon is not good at selecting generic game skill?

902
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:07,778
Rym: No, not at all.

903
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:11,511
Rym: What they need to do is select for drama and drama alone.

904
00:53:11,852 --> 00:53:14,180
Rym: pick games that cause nothing but drama.

905
00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:18,033
Rym: But they can't be random because then it's no more drama than a roulette table.

906
00:53:18,314 --> 00:53:24,239
Scott: hmm roulette I thought of roulette, but I immediately cancel it out.

907
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:30,720
Scott: Yeah, maybe poker cuz I think doing roulette playing roulette for a prize a chess box Japan would not go over.

908
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,725
Rym: Well, what about chess box?

909
00:53:31,745 --> 00:53:32,932
Rym: You would need the Gaming Commission.

910
00:53:32,952 --> 00:53:34,360
Rym: I would play chess boxing.

911
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:37,031
Scott: Yeah, you can't have people going to the hospital either.

912
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:39,320
Rym: I don't know if you get them to sign some waivers.

913
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:42,540
Scott: I think that the big sumo suits would be a good choice.

914
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:51,820
Scott: Right, I mean come on yeah or that the joust, you know not joust with it with the with the ostriches joust set.

915
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:57,689
Rym: American gladiators American gladiators See my crab people.

916
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:05,896
Rym: Well, no, remember we had that idea that the Build the agro crag behind stage or make a double dare set double dare set.

917
00:54:06,196 --> 00:54:07,340
Rym: Oh man double dare set.

918
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:09,019
Scott: Yeah, all right.

919
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:16,140
Rym: So I know packs was awesome and We didn't do much else other than play games and do all the things that we just said we did.

920
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:20,852
Rym: I mean we hung out with John st John for most of Friday and then Saturday we let in Sunday.

921
00:54:20,872 --> 00:54:22,137
Rym: We let him go off and do his own thing.

922
00:54:22,478 --> 00:54:24,959
Scott: Yeah Oh, I can't I can't think of anything else.

923
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,500
Rym: Well, we had all the weird meta stuff like on Friday, right a lot of people have talked about this.

924
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:35,000
Rym: No, we we invited John st John and also the enforcers pulled in and brought him to packs of our own volition.

925
00:54:35,643 --> 00:54:37,571
Rym: None of us knew Duke Nukem forever was coming.

926
00:54:37,873 --> 00:54:39,540
Scott: No, no, no, but not at not a clue.

927
00:54:39,621 --> 00:54:42,140
Scott: We did it solely because we needed a guest for the late show.

928
00:54:42,622 --> 00:54:46,094
Scott: We knew that he went to bag fest and was amicable and he was awesome.

929
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:50,180
Rym: So we give him a ring So and it worked out and we're hanging out with him.

930
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:56,518
Rym: We're having lunch at Von's on like Friday afternoon and suddenly Twitter fucking explodes with Duke Duke and forever.

931
00:54:56,558 --> 00:54:57,260
Rym: Duke Nukem forever.

932
00:54:57,642 --> 00:55:00,936
Rym: And I'm like what Duke Duke him forever is trending and he looks at us.

933
00:55:00,977 --> 00:55:03,145
Rym: He's like, oh shit I didn't leak anything did I?

934
00:55:03,527 --> 00:55:04,812
Scott: and we're like, oh shit.

935
00:55:04,852 --> 00:55:06,940
Scott: He just said he was worried about leaking something.

936
00:55:07,322 --> 00:55:08,511
Scott: That means it's for real.

937
00:55:08,692 --> 00:55:12,940
Rym: and then he's like, yeah You guys have probably figured it out by now.

938
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,933
Rym: And then we talked about the whole story that we didn't even fucking know.

939
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:27,728
Rym: and he was like, yeah all these rumors started because of you guys in this late show, but And we had to wait for it and then if it happens and then of course right after the meal We went to the expo hall and sure enough turn up.

940
00:55:27,748 --> 00:55:28,812
Scott: There was Duke Nukem forever.

941
00:55:28,832 --> 00:55:29,354
Rym: There was.

942
00:55:29,575 --> 00:55:30,880
Rym: he snuck me into the back room.

943
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,972
Rym: I got to play it and see the little spiel and everything.

944
00:55:33,072 --> 00:55:33,515
Rym: It's real.

945
00:55:33,796 --> 00:55:34,199
Rym: I played it.

946
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,448
Rym: It's a game but that was quite a moment.

947
00:55:37,548 --> 00:55:42,040
Rym: packs has never trended before but packs now trended only because Duke Nukem forever.

948
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,135
Scott: Yeah, Duke Nukem forever trended and then packs trended right after it on Twitter.

949
00:55:45,457 --> 00:55:48,088
Scott: Yeah Man, what other it's really.

950
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:48,651
Scott: it's so cuz.

951
00:55:48,671 --> 00:55:50,800
Scott: I were just remember playing games so much.

952
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,386
Scott: They don't really remember much else.

953
00:55:52,406 --> 00:55:53,912
Rym: We did a whole show on the games.

954
00:55:53,972 --> 00:55:54,474
Rym: We played.

955
00:55:54,494 --> 00:55:55,960
Scott: I know there was the hidden level.

956
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,412
Scott: We could talk about the hidden level a little bit.

957
00:55:57,452 --> 00:55:58,339
Rym: Yeah over at the annex.

958
00:55:58,581 --> 00:55:59,785
Scott: So basically the annex.

959
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:04,139
Scott: since we we went to the annex and packs away and then impacts o9.

960
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,287
Scott: It was not used in packs 10.

961
00:56:06,287 --> 00:56:08,596
Scott: It was used again and had been renovated which is very nice.

962
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:12,640
Scott: Excellent renovation Good job construction workers and architects and so forth.

963
00:56:13,881 --> 00:56:20,077
Scott: The thing was the only way to get there was to go through the secret elevator in the back of the expo hall and it Was cool because it was the hidden level.

964
00:56:20,743 --> 00:56:27,275
Scott: Yeah, yet a lot of people found their way to the hidden level no problem And it was pretty crowded back there and that was where all the watsy stuff was.

965
00:56:27,696 --> 00:56:34,640
Scott: and we're all the other Tabletop game people had like their booths and some gaming merchants were back there.

966
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:35,719
Scott: It was it was a good area.

967
00:56:36,224 --> 00:56:48,160
Scott: But the thing that was disappointing Was that there was another area of the annex that was still unused and I think everyone agreed and sort of knows That if they had moved the free tabletop to that area, it would have been a lot.

968
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,273
Scott: It would be much preferred, but we don't know if it's actually tricky.

969
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:52,960
Rym: you need for good tabletop.

970
00:56:53,361 --> 00:56:57,377
Rym: Many smaller rooms is much better than the standard gaming con one big room.

971
00:56:57,577 --> 00:56:58,260
Scott: That is true.

972
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,500
Scott: However, more space and more tables is always welcome.

973
00:57:01,681 --> 00:57:12,002
Rym: I would do both somehow or I would turn that other space Either I would try to make all of tabletop be in the annex like fill the annex and put like one more panel room over There.

974
00:57:12,022 --> 00:57:14,759
Rym: that is just for tabletop ERPG.

975
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:20,520
Scott: Well, one thing I would do is I would put some tabletop into the Raven Theatre and move the Raven Theatre over there.

976
00:57:20,862 --> 00:57:21,565
Scott: That's a good idea.

977
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:23,375
Rym: Well, we don't know how big the space is.

978
00:57:23,456 --> 00:57:24,220
Rym: I only poked around.

979
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:24,583
Rym: We couldn't.

980
00:57:24,603 --> 00:57:26,658
Scott: it was ropes blocking off that extra unused.

981
00:57:26,738 --> 00:57:29,400
Rym: later I snuck over there and poked around but most of the doors were locked.

982
00:57:29,523 --> 00:57:30,802
Scott: So yeah Nothing not much.

983
00:57:30,862 --> 00:57:38,318
Rym: but or what I would do is I would use that area to just add one thing that Pax Prime is lacking the art show.

984
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,368
Rym: That's the thing that Pax really needs.

985
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:48,760
Rym: and if they get that extra space and they put it there It's just a people funnel to get people out of the rest of the con and it doesn't detract from anything else.

986
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,804
Scott: Both Pax is.

987
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:55,307
Scott: the one thing I think both of them are missing is some way cuz you know at Otakon you have Dealers room artists alley and dealers.

988
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,739
Scott: room was people with money and artists alleys for everyone else, right?

989
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,780
Scott: Pax has the expo hall of people with money and if you don't have money, that's it, right?

990
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,755
Scott: They need to have that sort of sub expo hall.

991
00:58:05,836 --> 00:58:11,957
Scott: like me, you know That is where the normal people can go to get a booth or to put display there.

992
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:12,760
Scott: do-it-yourself.

993
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:20,463
Scott: You know user generated content kind of action, you know Really really really indie studios, you know the artists.

994
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:29,538
Scott: all that stuff needs a place at Pax and it doesn't have one right now and Hopefully with the more space in the BC EC and the annex edition it can happen, but we'll see.

995
00:58:29,959 --> 00:58:31,125
Rym: Yep We shall see indeed.

996
00:58:31,165 --> 00:58:34,160
Scott: The big thing is they have a philosophy of do it right or don't do it at all.

997
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,958
Scott: So I think that they're trying to figure out how to do except with the late shot.

998
00:58:40,946 --> 00:58:41,600
Rym: Now that was awesome

999
00:58:42,483 --> 00:58:42,683
Scott: Yeah,

1000
00:58:43,124 --> 00:58:50,006
Rym: so the sumos a bunch of enforcers were taking them home and we just heard this from literally a Random guy and the total

1001
00:58:50,107 --> 00:58:52,335
Scott: rumor from guy in guy in a lobby that

1002
00:58:52,355 --> 00:59:00,220
Rym: the sumos might be not Appearing at Pax in the future because the sumo company kind of doesn't want to give them a discount anymore.

1003
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:05,360
Scott: Because yeah, I don't want to take me like five minutes to explain it all but there might not be sumos.

1004
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,716
Scott: We don't know the deal but a bunch of enforcers got to take sumos home.

1005
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:09,439
Scott: So good for them.

1006
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:14,500
Rym: See now what I would have done if I were Pax is let enforcers sign them out and keep them all year.

1007
00:59:14,862 --> 00:59:16,471
Rym: All they have to do is bring them back to Pax.

1008
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:18,180
Scott: I think that's what they were doing.

1009
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,247
Scott: Yeah, but I don't know what they're doing now.

1010
00:59:20,508 --> 00:59:21,191
Scott: It's getting weird.

1011
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:21,773
Scott: So we'll say.

1012
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:23,860
Scott: the thing is what'll Pax be without sumos?

1013
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,182
Scott: You know what?

1014
00:59:24,282 --> 00:59:25,872
Scott: I didn't go in the sumos once this pass.

1015
00:59:25,892 --> 00:59:27,320
Rym: I was too busy doing shit.

1016
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,649
Scott: I was playing games instead.

1017
00:59:28,669 --> 00:59:30,240
Scott: Yeah tabletop instead of DS.

1018
00:59:31,061 --> 00:59:32,893
Rym: There were scalpers in front of Pax.

1019
00:59:32,913 --> 00:59:35,187
Rym: scalping is starting to be an issue So I don't want to get it.

1020
00:59:35,207 --> 00:59:35,589
Rym: notice how.

1021
00:59:35,629 --> 00:59:37,480
Scott: it's not an issue of Pax East only at Pax West.

1022
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:38,586
Rym: Well, it'll it'll be.

1023
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:39,570
Rym: if it issue of Pax East.

1024
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:40,113
Rym: you think so.

1025
00:59:40,173 --> 00:59:40,877
Rym: I am so sure.

1026
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:42,423
Scott: I don't know So one.

1027
00:59:42,885 --> 00:59:47,280
Rym: we were talking to enforcers and things and I'm sure there will be some way to make this a better.

1028
00:59:48,622 --> 00:59:57,460
Rym: We got some cool ideas, but all that aside if you want to go to Pax or you think you want to go to Pax Just pre register the day it goes online.

1029
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:58,806
Rym: There's no reason not to.

1030
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:04,699
Rym: you can resell your badge and if Pax is guaranteed to sell out You're guaranteed to be able to resell the badge if you don't attend.

1031
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:11,625
Scott: Yeah, if you if you have an inkling that you want to go to any Pax East or West the day the pre-orders go on Don't hesitate.

1032
01:00:11,665 --> 01:00:12,330
Scott: just pre-order.

1033
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,539
Scott: boom immediately, right?

1034
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:21,600
Scott: You'll get the badge in the mail and if it turns out that something happens at the last minute You can't actually go sell the badge legitimately not like a scalper, right?

1035
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,914
Scott: You're only selling the one badge or two badges you bought.

1036
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:27,079
Scott: you're not scalping 500 like that jerk, right?

1037
01:00:28,097 --> 01:00:30,082
Scott: The Cool odd.

1038
01:00:30,163 --> 01:00:39,540
Rym: some in some enterprising penny arcade and packed staff decided that the best way to deter that one scalper Let's just walk out and start videoing him and taking pictures of him until he felt awkward and ran away.

1039
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:47,820
Scott: I heard a rumor that Robert coup like Emailed a bunch of Craigslist scalpers went and met them all in a parking lot and bought all their badges back from them all at once.

1040
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:51,480
Rym: God, I think at this point I have like a man crush on Robert coup who does not?

1041
01:00:53,162 --> 01:00:53,645
Scott: Non men.

1042
01:00:53,665 --> 01:00:55,116
Scott: Yeah, non men.

1043
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,288
Rym: Yes So we'll see that.

1044
01:00:58,429 --> 01:01:00,040
Rym: buy your packs badges right away.

1045
01:01:00,162 --> 01:01:06,695
Rym: If you guys do that The scalpers can't get you because it's not that easy to scalp packs badges that quickly.

1046
01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:11,360
Scott: and also if all the badges sell out Faster that gives the scalpers less time to buy a ton of them.

1047
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,980
Rym: It also gives packs some advantages that are kind of behind the scenes advantage.

1048
01:01:15,065 --> 01:01:21,920
Scott: Yeah It's better for the convention if the badges sell faster than if they sell slower because then they have more time to know things.

1049
01:01:22,061 --> 01:01:24,259
Scott: You know more information sooner means better planning.

1050
01:01:25,105 --> 01:01:27,340
Rym: One cool thing in the expo hall we did see was, you know geek chic.

1051
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:33,302
Rym: They make that awesome like heritage heirloom like all like crazy furniture for nerds They have.

1052
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:34,426
Scott: they have coffee tables now.

1053
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,734
Rym: They had the hoplite coffee table there.

1054
01:01:36,814 --> 01:01:37,898
Rym: And now that I actually saw it.

1055
01:01:38,139 --> 01:01:38,480
Scott: I want it.

1056
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:44,420
Rym: It's exactly what I need and it's not that anyone want my coffee table that it's like 1500 bucks for the fully loaded one.

1057
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:48,940
Scott: Yeah, I think I'm gonna get a very chilly barrel coffee table cost more than I'll get it eventually.

1058
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,958
Scott: Eventually not right away eventually because I was serviceable.

1059
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,923
Rym: coffee There's think of this.

1060
01:01:53,165 --> 01:01:57,244
Rym: that table cost only slightly more than it cost to fly John st.

1061
01:01:57,284 --> 01:01:59,574
Rym: John two packs and give him a hotel for three days.

1062
01:01:59,614 --> 01:02:01,000
Scott: It cost slightly more than a computer.

1063
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,971
Rym: Yeah and it's so much better than a computer.

1064
01:02:04,293 --> 01:02:04,595
Rym: of course.

1065
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:10,080
Rym: apparently the Geek cheeks getting popular enough to where there is like a nine to twelve month lag time.

1066
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:13,473
Scott: I realize there's a lag time with pretty much anyone who does any sort of furniture.

1067
01:02:13,513 --> 01:02:19,765
Scott: that's custom because it takes them so long to Make it and they only have so many guys and it's hard to get more people and it's hard to get more Space and whatever.

1068
01:02:19,805 --> 01:02:22,339
Scott: So there's always gonna be a lag time and that sort of thing.

1069
01:02:23,146 --> 01:02:30,680
Rym: So one weird aside, you know Thursday We got to the con Wednesday night because it was cheaper to pay for a hotel Wednesday than it was to fly out Thursday.

1070
01:02:30,763 --> 01:02:37,967
Rym: Yep And I feel like I should do this every year because being in town all day Thursday Proved to me one a couple of things.

1071
01:02:38,408 --> 01:02:40,857
Rym: one Seattle's really fun to run around in for a day.

1072
01:02:40,877 --> 01:02:48,619
Scott: Like we went to this Andy Warhol exhibit and this Kurt go bad Museum and we just happen to go in and it happened to be totally free that day.

1073
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:50,265
Rym: There was stuff to do.

1074
01:02:50,305 --> 01:02:52,051
Rym: we went to the utility store store.

1075
01:02:52,151 --> 01:02:53,616
Rym: We got utility kilts.

1076
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:54,620
Scott: Oh, yeah forgot all about it.

1077
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,972
Rym: Yeah, that store tries so hard to be so manly.

1078
01:02:57,992 --> 01:03:00,300
Rym: they give you a fucking beer if you buy one.

1079
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:11,995
Rym: Yeah they were really cool though and we got kilts and the the actual like skirts the actual like owner and creator and everything was there and He came over and personally fitted me and I got my kilt.

1080
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:13,240
Rym: Yep fucking love that thing.

1081
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,459
Rym: I'm gonna buy another one as soon as I feel like it.

1082
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:17,569
Scott: I don't know if I'd buy another one so fast.

1083
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:20,020
Rym: I need to for one reason one reason alone.

1084
01:03:20,684 --> 01:03:24,502
Rym: I pretty much see myself wearing a kilt Anytime.

1085
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:25,345
Rym: I'm not going to work.

1086
01:03:25,907 --> 01:03:26,369
Scott: Nah.

1087
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,180
Rym: Yeah, like all I feel like I'm gonna go all kilts all the time.

1088
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:30,264
Scott: I don't know if I'll do that.

1089
01:03:30,285 --> 01:03:31,309
Scott: You need to.

1090
01:03:31,671 --> 01:03:33,740
Rym: you can't wear the same pants every day.

1091
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:37,300
Scott: I'll wear it when it's clean and then I'll wash it and I'll wear it when it's clean and you know.

1092
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:41,480
Rym: Yeah, but even if it's clean, you know if I wear it Friday, I feel a little weird wearing it Saturday.

1093
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:44,915
Scott: I could wear it Sunday though and Friday and Saturday.

1094
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:46,120
Scott: No, just Friday and Sunday.

1095
01:03:47,601 --> 01:03:48,724
Rym: But what about Saturday?

1096
01:03:48,744 --> 01:03:51,451
Rym: I'll wear shorts plus you could wear it to work.

1097
01:03:52,033 --> 01:03:53,015
Rym: I could I can't.

1098
01:03:53,657 --> 01:03:54,760
Scott: I don't know about the bicycling.

1099
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,480
Scott: They say I could bicycle with it, but I don't know I'd have to use that modesty thing.

1100
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:14,173
Rym: Yeah, but even with the modesty thing, it's still Yeah, but the other important thing I learned is that the Sheraton Lobby was full of people playing games all day Thursday all night Thursday all Night Sunday and there were reports of people playing games much of Monday.

1101
01:04:14,193 --> 01:04:16,320
Scott: Did you research the cost of getting the the ballroom?

1102
01:04:16,762 --> 01:04:17,379
Rym: I'm looking into it.

1103
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,980
Rym: I don't want to talk about it live because you know, we got to do this thing by mine.

1104
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:21,803
Scott: It might not happen.

1105
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:23,712
Rym: But yeah, if we can.

1106
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:25,580
Rym: we talked about this in the other pack show.

1107
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:25,921
Rym: We did.

1108
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:32,484
Rym: we are going to try to set up a non sanctioned GeekNights packs pre and/or post party Mm-hmm.

1109
01:04:32,886 --> 01:04:38,256
Rym: the PAX Prime pre post party BB BB BB BB BB the.

1110
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:41,375
Scott: But with the G in the front is the GeekNights.

1111
01:04:41,718 --> 01:04:46,918
Rym: Yeah We're working on it because there were a lot of people playing games like it was.

1112
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:55,917
Rym: in fact I would say that if you don't have a badge to packs You can still enjoy a lot of packs because though the lobby of the Sheraton is better than most gaming cons.

1113
01:04:55,978 --> 01:04:57,586
Rym: I've ever attended Mm-hmm.

1114
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:01,621
Rym: That's sad, but it's true All righty Is there?

1115
01:05:01,782 --> 01:05:04,673
Scott: was there anything else at packs that wasn't us playing a game

1116
01:05:04,773 --> 01:05:09,767
Rym: other than the fact that I have to give huge shout outs to Every single enforcer at all of

1117
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:18,452
Scott: every single fan every single person who came up to us and told us our panel was awesome Every person who came to our event anyone who suffered through the late show

1118
01:05:18,512 --> 01:05:20,840
Rym: the enforcers because multiple enforcers.

1119
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:30,939
Rym: I had conversations that went along the lines of blah blah blah tribes - and they would interrupt me and say oh my god Yeah tribes - oh And we would nerd about it for a while.

1120
01:05:31,321 --> 01:05:32,647
Rym: Yeah, I'd like mental orgasms.

1121
01:05:32,968 --> 01:05:35,960
Rym: I ran into one enforcer who had never seen our panels before.

1122
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:43,680
Rym: He was like a new like theater or whatever enforcer and I was like, yeah You guys are awesome and I actually made him blush like he wasn't used to the praise.

1123
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:45,717
Rym: Yeah, I think he was a brand new.

1124
01:05:45,757 --> 01:05:49,170
Scott: apparently he was not paying attention at the closing ceremonies when gave an.

1125
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:54,307
Scott: taiko had their list of people that they remember to thank and They thanked all these people.

1126
01:05:54,327 --> 01:06:03,615
Scott: right but only when they thank the enforcers did the entire room Standing up standing Lee ovate for like a minute and Otakon takes some notice.

1127
01:06:04,097 --> 01:06:10,320
Scott: the way they treat their staff Yeah, and the way their staff treat the attendees and each other and people in general.

1128
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:17,060
Rym: Pax is I would go to 12 faxes a year if there were 12 I'll go to four packs.

1129
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:22,979
Rym: Well, I would go to four paxes in the as a panelist and entertainer and performer.

1130
01:06:22,999 --> 01:06:26,899
Rym: I Could go to 12 as just an attendee depends how far away they are.

1131
01:06:27,121 --> 01:06:29,977
Rym: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to pack Sydney more than once.

1132
01:06:29,997 --> 01:06:33,491
Rym: no I don't think I'm going to packs barely every every packs they ever make.

1133
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:40,679
Scott: I will go to once but every year I will only go to one packs repeatedly every three months.

1134
01:06:41,641 --> 01:06:53,973
Rym: Yeah, but I said it before and I got to say it again Robert Greg heel Matt Graham Everyone who helped us with the late show Molly 23 for coming out and doing that act Alex Albrecht Duke Nukem Even roosterteeth, even though you guys were drunk.

1135
01:06:54,596 --> 01:06:55,220
Rym: Yeah, really?

1136
01:06:56,322 --> 01:06:57,446
Scott: You showed up on time.

1137
01:06:57,466 --> 01:07:01,300
Scott: Yeah, I mean, hey, you know, you came out you helped us with our show.

1138
01:07:01,742 --> 01:07:03,188
Scott: We didn't pay you or anything.

1139
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:05,198
Rym: We didn't get to argue enough about machinima.

1140
01:07:05,218 --> 01:07:07,526
Rym: machinima I want to actually argue that out when you're sober.

1141
01:07:07,586 --> 01:07:08,589
Scott: apparently they didn't want to.

1142
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:10,114
Rym: I really wanted to though.

1143
01:07:10,134 --> 01:07:14,588
Rym: Alright anyway, so What else can I say other than the packs?

1144
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,877
Rym: is pretty much the best con I ever see.

1145
01:07:16,938 --> 01:07:17,420
Scott: step it up.

1146
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:20,190
Rym: Oh my god packs is in less than six months.

1147
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,680
Scott: You know what thing it you know what though PAX East.

1148
01:07:23,222 --> 01:07:26,256
Scott: You're gonna be able to place it five at packs with all other people.

1149
01:07:26,336 --> 01:07:28,479
Rym: Oh my god I'll have to get a new laptop.

1150
01:07:29,641 --> 01:07:34,300
Scott: You just go in the PC area and maybe you bring your own PC and we'll do sieve five in there.

1151
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:34,963
Rym: No, I'll bring.

1152
01:07:35,024 --> 01:07:42,565
Rym: I'll get a laptop that can play it and then I'll bring my own PC double sieve Also weird.

1153
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:46,663
Rym: no, I got you know, Robert Koo gets a lot of shout outs But I have to.

1154
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:52,280
Rym: I really have to kind of publicly thank him for something because he you know makes packs happen.

1155
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,660
Rym: He makes all this stuff happen exactly made everything happen.

1156
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:58,740
Rym: I am pretty sure that he's not actually a person but some sort of clone cyborg from the future.

1157
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:00,218
Scott: we know that's a true fact, but

1158
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:16,700
Rym: Despite this that I've never seen him at a convention where he was not fixing something or on his way quickly to fix something and Despite always being in this state when we were in Thursday going to get our badges, you know Cuz they don't mail the panelist badges of all things which is cool.

1159
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,524
Rym: We were looking for cuz.

1160
01:08:18,545 --> 01:08:18,966
Rym: they moved it.

1161
01:08:19,006 --> 01:08:21,500
Rym: cuz there's this other con like where the reg was supposed to be.

1162
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,265
Rym: so they moved it.

1163
01:08:22,346 --> 01:08:23,618
Rym: they hadn't like sorted all that out yet.

1164
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:28,953
Rym: and We look confused for no more than one second over.

1165
01:08:29,014 --> 01:08:33,572
Rym: Robert Koo personally walks over says Oh, yeah, you guys are looking to introduce himself.

1166
01:08:33,631 --> 01:08:35,099
Scott: He didn't know that we knew who he was.

1167
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:36,929
Rym: I don't know if you knew who we were.

1168
01:08:36,948 --> 01:08:37,050
Rym: cuz.

1169
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:38,537
Rym: I think he knows what we look like.

1170
01:08:38,598 --> 01:08:39,421
Rym: I don't know I don't know.

1171
01:08:39,723 --> 01:08:45,328
Rym: I interact with him very sparsely, but he just comes up out of nowhere says Oh, you're looking for packs registration.

1172
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:47,979
Rym: I assume come with me and he just took us down to it.

1173
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,091
Scott: He escorted us personally, right?

1174
01:08:50,131 --> 01:08:51,116
Rym: And then he said here you go.

1175
01:08:51,357 --> 01:08:51,799
Rym: Enjoy it.

1176
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:54,751
Rym: And then he vanished in a puff of smoke.

1177
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:58,578
Scott: Yes, but I mean Concierge Otakon would never do that now.

1178
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:05,660
Scott: Well, it depends on the concierge in bowls would have done that maybe but you know When is he gonna meet you at the bottom of the elevator where you're looking lost?

1179
01:09:05,861 --> 01:09:07,107
Scott: You know, not gonna.

1180
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,779
Scott: he's probably busy already with the con by that time.

1181
01:09:10,582 --> 01:09:15,700
Rym: Also shout out again to Aaron see I love all you enforcers, but he's my favorite enforcer.

1182
01:09:16,821 --> 01:09:18,386
Scott: Row you smacking row down.

1183
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:22,819
Rym: Oh credit know cuz row is our crew, but I guess Aaron's now also in our crew.

1184
01:09:23,402 --> 01:09:29,106
Rym: So you're both my favorites and Jeremy shit see The trouble with shoutouts.

1185
01:09:29,688 --> 01:09:31,835
Rym: Yeah, but I'm glad that we had.

1186
01:09:31,895 --> 01:09:32,336
Rym: it was cool.

1187
01:09:32,356 --> 01:09:41,412
Rym: We had a sort of Front row crew plus Azen posse plus West Coast front row crew Private after party at PAX.

1188
01:09:41,754 --> 01:09:50,331
Rym: It was good because you know we're trying to find a restaurant that'll seat like 20 people in short notice and We actually found a place and they gave us a private room and they did.

1189
01:09:50,532 --> 01:09:53,080
Rym: they did separate checks for every individual person.

1190
01:09:53,282 --> 01:09:53,706
Scott: It was good.

1191
01:09:53,725 --> 01:09:54,251
Scott: I like that.

1192
01:09:54,412 --> 01:09:55,179
Scott: They didn't care either.

1193
01:09:55,621 --> 01:09:58,130
Rym: Yeah, in fact they offered it but the funniest thing.

1194
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:01,682
Rym: so we're sitting there right and then we see spiky hair and we look Sure enough.

1195
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:05,555
Rym: Alex Albrecht and his post-pax party was right next to the private room.

1196
01:10:05,937 --> 01:10:06,097
Scott: Yeah.

1197
01:10:06,499 --> 01:10:08,465
Scott: Yeah How about that coincidence?

1198
01:10:08,685 --> 01:10:11,995
Scott: people at PAX doing the same late show eating in the same restaurant at the same time?

1199
01:10:12,096 --> 01:10:17,314
Scott: Oh Man, remember when he went to the the hidden Indian place that was giving the packs discount.

1200
01:10:17,515 --> 01:10:18,940
Scott: Oh, yeah, but we went too early.

1201
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,903
Rym: We went Thursday, so we didn't get the packs this but instead he brought us that fresh naan that he made just for us Right then.

1202
01:10:24,044 --> 01:10:26,600
Scott: so yeah, but it was totally empty and weird, but it was awesome.

1203
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:33,500
Rym: Yeah, also the fact that on Sunday right we needed some breakfast and we didn't want to get double waffles again.

1204
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:40,438
Rym: So we go over and we're walking toward like the mall just to find some breakfast and we were gonna pass Vaughn's.

1205
01:10:40,518 --> 01:10:46,654
Rym: and I say out loud man Scott Imagine if Vaughn's had some fucking bread and then sure enough they had it.

01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:57,625

1210
01:10:57,645 --> 01:11:00,452
Rym: now that Connecticut Hotel stands far and above.

1211
01:11:00,773 --> 01:11:06,267
Scott: but the flavor of say the potato Man, it was a good a potato.
