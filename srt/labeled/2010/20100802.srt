1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,556
Rym: Hey, it's Monday August 2nd.

2
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:11,418
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,750
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight a Monday episode.

4
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,888
Rym: For the first time in a while.

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,741
Rym: Automated killing machine.

6
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:27,349
Scott: for the first time in a while Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:31,787
Rym: Hmm do the bender help that?

8
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:35,500
Rym: do the better start Scott to draw penises on your boogie board.

9
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:36,604
Scott: What I mean?

10
00:00:37,126 --> 00:00:38,350
Rym: you're ready to do a shower.

11
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:39,836
Rym: you uh you finish there.

12
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:40,840
Rym: That's a quite a cock.

13
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:42,679
Scott: What are you talking about?

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,548
Rym: You see it's too bad that this is just a radio show.

15
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,360
Rym: Scott drew a magnificent penis on his boogie board.

16
00:00:48,702 --> 00:00:49,609
Rym: This is like the fourth one.

17
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:51,180
Rym: He's drawn while we were doing pre-production.

18
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:57,720
Rym: In fact, he drew so many hairs on it that it started to obscure the very nature of the base of the phallus.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,236
Scott: What is what is wrong with you?

20
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,128
Rym: Scott I could just take a picture with my phone anytime.

21
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:06,760
Rym: So you might want to cut that a picture of what that penis.

22
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:16,611
Scott: Why you want to take a picture of my penis, okay moving on We've done a Monday show so I guess you start off with penises.

23
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:17,313
Scott: that's just wonderful.

24
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:23,334
Rym: we we we I Believe it is you and you alone who brought the penis into this conversation.

25
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:23,936
Scott: what penis?

26
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:25,140
Scott: I didn't even say anything.

27
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:26,483
Rym: Of course you drew it.

28
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,168
Scott: What did I draw Scott?

29
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,657
Rym: You're obsessed with this like off-band sub channel communication.

30
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:35,433
Rym: Uh-huh Okay, we'll see when you draw another penis.

31
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:36,299
Scott: I got my eye on you.

32
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:40,253
Scott: So anyway, we haven't done a Monday show and like for fuck ever.

33
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:41,979
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's actually Tuesday, isn't it?

34
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:46,060
Rym: We were gonna pretend that we put this show up yesterday and see who noticed.

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,248
Scott: I like how I want to pretend and keep something secret.

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,938
Scott: We don't but when you want to pretend we also don't.

37
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:57,460
Rym: yeah Well, we I mean our review of Otakon will be up cuz we were there and it was awesome.

38
00:01:57,962 --> 00:01:58,565
Scott: I know you weren't.

39
00:01:58,605 --> 00:01:59,128
Rym: you weren't there.

40
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:01,017
Scott: No, it sounded pretty good though.

41
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:04,328
Rym: Yeah There were no new complaints.

42
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:09,076
Rym: that has nothing to do with Monday now, but it's weird Usually at this time of year, right?

43
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:17,280
Rym: Otakon Otakon GeekNights gets totally screwed up because like we go to Otakon then we go to the week of awesome our writers Retreat and then pags at all these conventions.

44
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:22,779
Rym: So we'll have like a week or two where GeekNights is just like gone and then we come back this year.

45
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,388
Rym: Fucking nothing happened.

46
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:26,320
Rym: We just didn't do Monday show forever.

47
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,360
Scott: We're going to PAX though in a month in the month and that will definitely interrupt the the GeekNights.

48
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,112
Rym: Also, I'm going to the writers retreat next week.

49
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,076
Rym: So I'm gonna be gone.

50
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:36,940
Rym: I don't know what'll happen.

51
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,354
Rym: We there may or may not be GeekNights.

52
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:38,919
Scott: Who knows?

53
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,388
Scott: Yeah, we haven't done a Monday show and fuck ever.

54
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,699
Scott: just cuz it was always like coincidences that we had things to.

55
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,979
Scott: you know It was either you know Monday night wasn't on the schedule or we had an actual thing to go to.

56
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:58,937
Scott: So it was like We're either going to a thing when we're supposed to do a show or it's not time to do a show.

57
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:02,880
Scott: and no Monday Shows got made for over a month and a half in every instance.

58
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:09,315
Rym: It was a situation where normally would say Well, we'll just do a Monday show next week and even it out the next week.

59
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:12,227
Rym: There was something else on Monday Yeah, including yesterday.

60
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:14,940
Scott: There was something on Monday, but it had been so long since a Monday show.

61
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,739
Scott: We just had to do one anyway, and we'll just back date it so that it goes up.

62
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:21,660
Rym: I think what hurts too is that I do have a lot to say about tech.

63
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:26,687
Rym: like there's a lot of tech news there's stuff going on, but It's been not just gaming season.

64
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:28,693
Rym: It has been PC gaming season.

65
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:32,086
Scott: for me for a while now It has been PC.

66
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,713
Scott: It's been everything season.

67
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:34,536
Scott: Wait, wait gig nights.

68
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:38,052
Rym: 2006 called PC gaming is dead.

69
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:39,317
Scott: I know right now.

70
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:39,860
Rym: It's back.

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,866
Scott: Not really steam saved.

72
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:44,314
Scott: a thing is steam that I love that everyone else hate.

73
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:50,015
Rym: as big as my PC gaming is right now It's still a drop in the bucket compared to console gaming everywhere else.

74
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:53,988
Rym: Yeah, pretty much It's a PC gaming Renaissance for us and Koreans.

75
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:54,910
Scott: Yep.

76
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:59,243
Rym: Yeah, Scott John's you just popped up playing Starcraft 2.

77
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:00,594
Scott: You know, I haven't played Starcraft 2 yet.

78
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:01,822
Scott: cuz I'm playing Starcraft You shouldn't?

79
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,813
Rym: you should make that configuration change first or it'll make your video card overheat.

80
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,740
Rym: All right, there's a problem.

81
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,426
Rym: It's ruining people's video cards.

82
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:09,148
Scott: Is this true?

83
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:09,610
Rym: Yes.

84
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:10,874
Rym: Well, here's the deal.

85
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,480
Rym: It does not have a frame cap.

86
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:22,540
Rym: So a lot of people with ATI cards or with laptops or anything like that When they're near in the menus if you sit in the menu too long, it runs at a near infinite frame rate.

87
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:26,634
Rym: So the video card says I gotta pump out as many frames as I can and max.

88
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,240
Scott: what if I just enable vertical sync?

89
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,488
Rym: Uh, I don't know if that fixes it.

90
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:32,417
Rym: There's some particular I and I follow.

91
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,100
Rym: you have to update.

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,462
Scott: Why don't?

93
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:35,491
Scott: they just put it a patch they haven't yet?

94
00:04:36,113 --> 00:04:37,339
Rym: Okay, I imagine they will.

95
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:43,860
Rym: I Changed this configuration setting like slash job told me to and my computer stopped overheating playing Starcraft.

96
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,546
Rym: So I'd recommend all of you do that.

97
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,956
Scott: All right, I guess that's technology related.

98
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:48,297
Scott: Yeah.

99
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:55,745
Rym: Yeah So anyway, so the worst thing is I'm at work, right and my co-workers like yeah Starcraft 2 keeps making my PC crash But nothing else does.

100
00:04:56,066 --> 00:05:00,165
Rym: and I was like, well clearly you have an ATI card He's like that's not the problem.

101
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:03,700
Rym: But I do have an ATI card and I was like, it's totally your drivers.

102
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:04,858
Rym: He's like, no, you're full of shit.

103
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,478
Rym: and then Yesterday, I was like, yeah, you know what?

104
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,731
Rym: ATI sucks, but Well, I had to clarify to qualify that again.

105
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:17,180
Rym: ATI sucks at certain price points.

106
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,364
Scott: And this is that all.

107
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:24,700
Scott: right now ATI is actually beating Nvidia at the price performance ratio.

108
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,329
Rym: Yeah at the specially at the high-end ATR cards.

109
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,132
Rym: kick the ass.

110
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,220
Scott: the problem is the drivers suck.

111
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:33,071
Rym: They don't suck nearly as much as they used to to the point.

112
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:36,586
Rym: suck that it's pretty much a non-issue Unless you use Linux.

113
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,896
Rym: Yeah, and even then it's not that bad.

114
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,847
Scott: I Still wouldn't get one.

115
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,440
Rym: I wouldn't get one either but you know what?

116
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,820
Rym: I'm in a position where price doesn't matter anymore.

117
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:48,516
Rym: If I didn't have the money I have I would still consider AMD.

118
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:52,216
Rym: every time I build a computer I buy Intel just because I can pay money.

119
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:57,737
Scott: to not worry I just want to point out right of all the can we've been building computers for like over a decade, right?

120
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:05,100
Scott: And So in the late 90s, I bought I made a Pentium 3 and after that for the next decade.

121
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:07,248
Rym: Well that had what that Intel BX board.

122
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:09,435
Scott: Yeah, the one that still works probably.

123
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:15,340
Scott: Yeah, every a bit I only replaced it because it was old and slow not because it stopped working.

124
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,400
Rym: I've got like three a bit.

125
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:29,173
Rym: It ran a really kickin icy world server that I built along the way That have come and died in the span of that BX board continuing Yeah, and meanwhile right for a decade.

126
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:32,663
Scott: I kept buying AMD computers And they all failed.

127
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:38,780
Scott: and then I just bought an Intel computer and it's a hundred percent perfect in every way.

128
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:46,737
Rym: Yeah I think the difference is I Don't put as much effort into building computers as I used to because it doesn't it.

129
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,540
Rym: it's weird.

130
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:56,392
Rym: It's like it doesn't matter as much when I was building my first computer and I spent like four grand and I got that Scuzzy card and that holy shit Rym has a CD burner.

131
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:58,818
Scott: I had a CD burner is a hundred and fifty dollar.

132
00:06:58,858 --> 00:06:59,360
Scott: Plex door.

133
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:00,666
Scott: Yeah, 8x.

134
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:02,433
Rym: Remember when it mattered like you'd?

135
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,880
Rym: you'd be like I'm buying the Plex door.

136
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,769
Rym: It cost ten times as much but it doesn't coaster now.

137
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:09,216
Rym: I buy the cheapest piece of shit burner.

138
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:10,019
Rym: that's on new.

139
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,960
Scott: a well That's because you're hardly burning right?

140
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,860
Scott: And even if I burn is those days you were burning it the fuck up.

141
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,912
Scott: But nowadays your heart you you know, what's the last time you burned anything?

142
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:22,265
Rym: I was gonna make a joke about dinner, but Yeah.

143
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:31,620
Rym: or the more meta joke AMD the further repeat meta joke I burned out my video card playing Starcraft.

144
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,471
Scott: Yeah I've burned your face off with my flamethrower.

145
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:38,160
Scott: burns your mom with what?

146
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,320
Scott: Your mom you got to use some lube so you don't get burned.

147
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:53,345
Rym: If your mom wasn't so dry wouldn't be an issue, okay But and so small.

148
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:57,398
Rym: but like I used to agonize over like do I get this cast latency?

149
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,281
Rym: that cast latency?

150
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:59,787
Rym: I'd look at benchmarks now.

151
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,674
Rym: I can look and say you know what.

152
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:08,219
Rym: a hundred bucks more I'll guarantee I don't have a problem with X and I'm just like, alright a hundred bucks or four hours of research.

153
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:24,060
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so I'll say this all of you out there GeekNights listeners if you're building a new computer Go to our old episodes for advice because now my advice really boils down to spend money or spend time.

154
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,320
Scott: Researching thing is remember those guys at ConnectiCon I wish I remember.

155
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:29,820
Rym: Oh, yeah, go to those guys those guys, right?

156
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:35,720
Scott: So these guys get did a panel about building a computer and I think they run a computer building company.

157
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:39,227
Rym: I was for gamers and Scott And vocal.

158
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:46,740
Scott: they completely agree with with us Even though it's their jobs and it's our like fifth or sixth hobby.

159
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:50,431
Rym: Thing is they agree with us on the high-level stuff, which you know.

160
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:53,480
Rym: people who disagree I think are pretty much just wrong.

161
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:58,080
Rym: But on the low-level stuff, it's not that we disagree it's that I don't know anymore.

162
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,420
Rym: Mmm, I don't know what cast latency to get or if it even matters.

163
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:06,465
Scott: Yes, get the best RAM that works in your motherboard and get enough of wait Wait the best RAM.

164
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:09,580
Rym: so you get the RAM that's rated for way over your clock speed.

165
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:12,700
Scott: No, that cost ten times as much the brand whatever your motherboard says.

166
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,952
Scott: So the motherboard says get DDR 800 then get DDR 800.

167
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:17,775
Scott: What are you gonna?

168
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:18,437
Rym: What are you gonna get?

169
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:19,540
Rym: Viking Corsair?

170
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:21,808
Scott: You get whichever one's cheapest.

171
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:22,671
Rym: it used to matter.

172
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:23,493
Rym: it used to matter.

173
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:25,199
Rym: I used to be at RAM and it would fucking break.

174
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,479
Scott: Well nowadays ram has you know doesn't break.

175
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:32,665
Rym: I'll have to buy like G-skill whatever this ran.

176
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,557
Rym: that looks so rice re and I look at I'm like do I really need that?

177
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,402
Rym: and then it's the cheapest And it works.

178
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:41,453
Rym: So okay guys, I've got blingin ram in there.

179
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:42,758
Scott: I also have some blingin ram.

180
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:46,134
Rym: Yeah Anyway, the where were you on Monday?

181
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:52,180
Scott: Oh So Basically, I'm like reading way less and less internets every day.

182
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:53,646
Scott: So I'm trying to.

183
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,480
Rym: I don't go to FARC anymore except when I need a thing of the day.

184
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,153
Scott: You know what my strategy is my long my strategy right in the beginning.

185
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:01,960
Scott: I was reading way all the internets.

186
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,140
Rym: Oh, yeah, go back to the beginning.

187
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,711
Rym: I read the entire internet which back then back then it was easy.

188
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:11,731
Rym: the internet when we were at RIT was comprised of BB spot meme pool Facebook.

189
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:15,704
Rym: No, not even Facebook Slashdot dig.

190
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,391
Rym: Oh, no, there wasn't even dig yet.

191
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,580
Rym: There wasn't much internet to look at now.

192
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:31,540
Scott: So anyway, I read all the internets and then I got a Google Reader and I was like reading all the internets And then I was reading dig and all the internets and then I stopped reading dig And then I stopped reading a bunch of stuff.

193
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,420
Rym: I can only read so many articles about how Ron Paul's gonna know.

194
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:39,839
Scott: So I was just reading in gadget Kotaku and boing boing and that's it.

195
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,886
Scott: And then when I got home at night, I would like watch CollegeHumor once and watch Cinemassacre if there's something new and that was it Right.

196
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:47,859
Scott: I even I even had a shit ton of podcasts.

197
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:50,294
Scott: now I've got like almost no podcasts cut them out.

198
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:51,259
Scott: and then.

199
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:56,179
Scott: So what I did recently like a few days ago is I started using Google Reader again.

200
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,159
Scott: So you think oh, no, that's more Internet's not less.

201
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,580
Scott: But here's what I did is I put oh I put in gadget Kotaku and boing boing in the Google Reader.

202
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,240
Scott: So I was really only visiting one site.

203
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:12,080
Rym: That was my biggest problem with Google Reader at first when I thought I need to consolidate my website reading to save time.

204
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,334
Rym: So I put all my websites in Google Reader and the same articles.

205
00:11:15,354 --> 00:11:16,640
Rym: They're like a thousand times.

206
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,860
Scott: So now I was reading three.

207
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,907
Scott: I was reading the same what three websites.

208
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:25,650
Scott: but I was doing in Google Reader and the difference was instead of scrolling past all These pictures and stopping at all these interesting things.

209
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,840
Scott: I was reading way less articles.

210
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:28,245
Scott: Like.

211
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:29,420
Scott: this is only like a couple weeks ago.

212
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,580
Scott: I did this right like I would read almost none of the articles and then I would click mark all is red.

213
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,413
Scott: They would all go away, you know, unless something really jumped out at me with its title not with its picture.

214
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:39,897
Scott: Just gone, right?

215
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:43,560
Scott: And So now I stopped going to the Google Reader.

216
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:54,100
Scott: so the only sites I look at are I look at my tweets like once or twice a day and College Humor once a day and Cinemassacre if there's an update and the wow and the

217
00:11:56,061 --> 00:12:02,058
Rym: Scott checking the internet things like Cinemassacre that don't even update that often are beating out things like the news.

218
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:04,365
Scott: Yeah Google News done.

219
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:04,807
Scott: Forget it.

220
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:05,692
Scott: I'm just done reading.

221
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:09,244
Scott: I go to Google News once a day, but That wouldn't be so bad.

222
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:10,469
Scott: But the thing is it's like destroy.

223
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:10,770
Rym: I'm in.

224
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,413
Rym: I need to.

225
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:15,490
Rym: I need to be aware to a degree Like it's not like I can be aware later.

226
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,720
Rym: Like I can't get home from work and like skim the news.

227
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,670
Rym: I got to know like today what's going on?

228
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:22,581
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is is That?

229
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:26,240
Scott: well, I guess I spent all this time reading news that was could spend doing something.

230
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,080
Scott: So now I'm done just reading all this bullshit.

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,445
Scott: Well, I guess I should qualify that when it's time to find a news or thing today I'll load them up and look around.

232
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:35,920
Rym: but everyone should be informed of like current events because you know what's going on in the world.

233
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:43,600
Rym: But the difference is most people also are kind of addicted I think to the emergence to where they don't need to know the state of the world.

234
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:49,300
Rym: They need to know what's the most interesting thing right now, and I think that is very counterproductive.

235
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:53,700
Scott: Thing is I don't think I really need to know, you know, let's look on Google News.

236
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:55,795
Scott: Let's see what is important for me to know.

237
00:12:55,957 --> 00:13:00,379
Scott: Let's see That there was a killing in Connecticut not important for me to know.

238
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,272
Rym: I think knowing about the status of the Gulf oil spill is good to know.

239
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:05,159
Scott: At least I don't need to know the status of it.

240
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,189
Scott: I mean, I know there's a Gulf oil spill.

241
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:07,973
Scott: what that's enough.

242
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:09,741
Rym: I need to know for the industry I'm in.

243
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:11,989
Rym: that'll really affect my day-to-day life.

244
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,714
Scott: All right, there's a new blackberry.

245
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:15,360
Scott: don't need to know that bread carve.

246
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:18,751
Rym: I was interested in the new blackberry because there's all this.

247
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,276
Rym: you see you this is interesting.

248
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:21,180
Rym: This is your skewed view.

249
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,325
Rym: There's a new blackberry my view.

250
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:30,968
Rym: all this crazy stuff is going on with Rym and Saudi Arabia and I can't talk about it But it there's.

251
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,980
Rym: there's a lot of important stuff going on.

252
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,354
Scott: It's funny that your name is Rym and their company is Rym anyway And I don't use a blackberry because I hate blackberries.

253
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:44,416
Rym: bread farve not important But Scott Bristol Palin is I think breaking up with someone.

254
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:45,039
Scott: Okay?

255
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:50,796
Scott: I Boston Celtics might sign you cares jailbreak.

256
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,120
Scott: I'm never gonna jailbreak ever.

257
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:54,727
Rym: You're looking at just Google News.

258
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:59,174
Rym: I subscribe to very specific Google News feeds Finance because I need to know that.

259
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:03,092
Rym: I don't need to know that Yeah, but I need I do world politics because I want to be aware of that.

260
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:04,959
Rym: Okay, that's it.

261
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:12,477
Rym: And domestic Oh, I guess world foreign relations and like domestic politics and finance and that's it.

262
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:13,440
Rym: and science.

263
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:16,091
Rym: But I have a feed that blocks out BS science.

264
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,340
Scott: Well, the Sun eruption spits plasma at Earth.

265
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,588
Scott: So there's one story that might be important.

266
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:21,652
Rym: That's the story.

267
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:23,820
Rym: that story will have no impact on you.

268
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,328
Scott: You don't think it's gonna cause a disruption.

269
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:27,640
Rym: not to you maybe to me, but not to you.

270
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:29,624
Scott: Why do you care?

271
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,211
Rym: How is that going to impact your life?

272
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:33,240
Scott: If there's a it there's a big solar flare.

273
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,883
Scott: It could totally fuck up like, you know the Internet's Probably not.

274
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:38,089
Scott: No, you don't think so now.

275
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:39,857
Scott: All right, then that's not important.

276
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:50,044
Rym: All right I Read Google News like but once a day, I think I'm trying to kind of get into knowing or not knowing It's a matter of.

277
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:54,121
Rym: I think a lot of the people who spend a lot of their time reading the Internet are Reading.

278
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:56,971
Rym: they read the news not to be informed about the world.

279
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:59,520
Rym: They read the news to get the serotonin fix.

280
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:03,494
Rym: They get the same thing from going to Google News that I get from going to FARC.

281
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:05,743
Scott: So there's nothing on Google News I needed to know.

282
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:08,313
Scott: let's look at you know, even in the Hacker News.

283
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:09,880
Scott: I was reading the Hacker News a while.

284
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,606
Scott: That's actually a fourth site that I added.

285
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:15,920
Rym: the honestly the biggest site that I gave up was BB spot and not BB spot.

286
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:16,658
Rym: Boing boing.

287
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:20,211
Rym: BB spot is like it used to serve the purpose that boing boing serve.

288
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:24,286
Rym: boing boing is nothing more to me than a Serotonin fix.

289
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:25,776
Rym: you want to see something interesting?

290
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:26,219
Rym: Here you go.

291
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:30,872
Rym: Always something interesting but never anything useful because if anything useful is there.

292
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:34,243
Rym: it's also on slash dot and it's also in all my other Aggregators.

293
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:42,300
Scott: the problem with the Hacker News right is that it has really good stuff But the thing is most of it it's actually run by this Y Combinator startup thing.

294
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:51,016
Scott: So like it's it's rough because if you go to any tech news site It's like all the tech news is getting intermingled with all this startup business news.

295
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:52,200
Scott: It's like get the fuck out.

296
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,932
Scott: Just tell me you know about programming or cool open source thing.

297
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:56,695
Scott: That's so.

298
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,260
Scott: so so don't give me all this.

299
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,706
Scott: You know, here's how to get rich bullshit.

300
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:01,569
Scott: get the fuck out of here.

301
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:07,144
Rym: This is us the utility to this day of Slash dot.

302
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:07,887
Rym: now hear me out.

303
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:11,578
Rym: I read slash dot is one of these so slow?

304
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:13,851
Rym: exactly This is one of the few websites.

305
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,019
Rym: I actually read.

306
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,773
Rym: I mean I skim FARC, especially if I need to think of the day.

307
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:20,860
Rym: and FARC updates faster than the real news.

308
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,340
Rym: Like if there's something emergent, I read the real news looking for articles that will affect me and I have filters for that.

309
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:31,180
Rym: But I read slash dot because it does not have the emergent news.

310
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:33,427
Rym: I do not get the serotonin fix.

311
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,917
Rym: slash dot does not update fast enough to have the serotonin fix.

312
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:39,959
Rym: it gets news days sometimes weeks late

313
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:41,027
Scott: But

314
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:54,191
Rym: if you read slash dot Regularly like once a day you go to slash shot and just read everything or at least look at all the titles You will get within the span of a couple weeks Everything noteworthy in the tech world.

315
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:55,797
Rym: a nice summary of it.

316
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:56,379
Scott: Mm-hmm.

317
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:59,380
Rym: So as a result, I don't get my serotonin fix.

318
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:03,900
Rym: I break my addiction to the internet, but I'm still informed of everything going on in the tech world.

319
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:13,260
Rym: I may be about a week late to everything But if something's emergent enough to where me finding out about it now as opposed to a week later matters I have other streams that get it to me faster.

320
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:21,758
Scott: The thing is I could just read like engage it once a week and I'll be good, you know It's like if I need to know there's too much bullshit in it and get half the stuff on.

321
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:23,067
Rym: engage it I don't care about no.

322
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:46,360
Scott: No, but here's what the thing with engage it Is that you can you don't have to actually scroll down just look at like the top stories like the little grid of pictures at the top and those are all the big stories also and gadget has these daily posts that say if you look the Last post of every day right before midnight and gadget makes a post that shows the popularity of all the stories of the day.

323
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:51,160
Scott: So all you have to do is read this maybe two stories in the red per day on average.

324
00:17:51,561 --> 00:18:03,720
Scott: so really if you know if you don't read and gadget for a week go look at all those posts and click on all the Red dots and you'll get like the 14 biggest freaking stories in all of tech, you know and gadgets electronics.

325
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:06,917
Rym: I think we should cut this conversation off because that was almost a show.

326
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:12,380
Rym: Yeah Okay, we should probably do a show on reading the internet because I'd look maybe that should have been this show.

327
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:15,197
Rym: We did a show on reading the internet a long time ago.

328
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:15,660
Rym: And you know what?

329
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,020
Rym: I bet if we listen to it, we will not agree with ourselves.

330
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:21,580
Scott: That's probably true for most of the old shows.

331
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:32,176
Rym: yeah, so I feel we should revisit old shows do the topic again and then post the old show in the feed again and then We will listen to it and then react to our old bullshit.

332
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:32,719
Scott: Should we?

333
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:35,731
Scott: Alright, should I talk about where I was yesterday or not?

334
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:36,374
Rym: You want to?

335
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:37,860
Scott: I don't know how much time do we use?

336
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,501
Scott: We've got.

337
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,689
Rym: this has been like 24 minutes.

338
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,135
Scott: All right, let's let's forget it.

339
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:43,620
Rym: We'll move on very briefly.

340
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:50,991
Rym: I do have a news it's worth talking about but briefly brief briefly Brief arena, I don't know why I got on some briefs.

341
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:59,750
Rym: No, god, no only little only like I can't to this day anyone in what tighty whities like just you know briefs.

342
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,873
Rym: I Cannot imagine you as being anything but an eight-year-old boy.

343
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:08,867
Rym: Seriously tidy whities That is what you're wearing.

344
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:09,690
Scott: this reasons.

345
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:14,150
Rym: Yeah, you know what men wear boxers Unless they're running.

346
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:16,599
Rym: then men wear Boxer briefs.

347
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,207
Scott: Boxer briefs are no different than briefs.

348
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:20,190
Scott: They just have leg parts.

349
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,854
Rym: Yes, and you only wear them running.

350
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:23,820
Rym: No other situation warrants them.

351
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:30,917
Rym: Anyway, so you can't charge your Apple stuff with commodity stuff for no good reason.

352
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:31,699
Rym: and here's proof.

353
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:42,300
Rym: This may not the minute because it'll say if you plug certain like just a random USB charger Into an Apple device a lot of times it'll say something like not supported charging device.

354
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:48,840
Scott: No, the reason that'll happen like for example I had I had some like old iPod accessories.

355
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:52,280
Scott: Right that would and you know, there's all these pins in the dock connector.

356
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,480
Scott: Yeah, and a lot of these old accessories would try to charge the iPod on the firewire pins, right?

357
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,800
Scott: But I Apple has removed firewire support from the iPods and iPhones and that was just USB support.

358
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:08,520
Scott: So the thing is is those pins are still on the dock connector.

359
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:22,579
Scott: So if the iPhone or a newer iPhone or iPod detects charging on the firewire connector It'll put up an error message like hey, just so you know, we can use this accessory But we can't charge from it because it's charging the old way and not the new way.

360
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:26,580
Scott: But if you charge on the USB pins it where it charge now, this is much more insidious.

361
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:30,514
Rym: So say someone, you know, you can USB cable to an iPhone, right?

362
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:32,260
Scott: Okay, you need the dock connector though.

363
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:33,544
Rym: Yeah, so you know what.

364
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:35,070
Rym: the dock connector aside.

365
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:36,113
Rym: It's just USB.

366
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:37,739
Rym: plug it into a computer it charges, right?

367
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:42,063
Scott: If you hook up the the correct pin to the correct Yeah, nobody.

368
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,451
Rym: you have the Apple thing the USB cable.

369
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,859
Rym: Okay, plug it in your computer just charges, right?

370
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:47,100
Rym: Yep

371
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:47,783
Scott: so

372
00:20:48,387 --> 00:21:00,259
Rym: if I make a device that isn't a computer and I want it to like the minty boost and I want to just charge my iPhone from it and I have an adapter cable and Everything uses the right pins because it's just USB it acts just like a USB device.

373
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:04,099
Rym: Yeah, you'll usually get a screen that says charging is not supported with this accessory.

374
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:09,175
Rym: Uh-huh, so minty boost there's this whole expose and I'm linking to it.

375
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:09,737
Rym: You can watch it.

376
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:10,279
Rym: It's pretty cool.

377
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:22,940
Rym: Disassemble the device that works and figure it out that Apple requires some weird low voltages Just to as far as they can tell prevent non licensed devices from charging the iPhone directly.

378
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,531
Scott: I don't know you had to be licensed to make an iPod accessory.

379
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,520
Scott: There's so many fucking accessories out there.

380
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:27,660
Scott: So if

381
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,360
Rym: you plug your iPhone into my like crap wall USB charger that Chinatown deal I bought it probably won't charge

382
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,521
Scott: Really,

383
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:40,842
Rym: but the minty boot they figured it out and this video shows how you how they figured it out how they got around it And it's why don't

384
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:41,966
Scott: they just take like?

385
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:43,432
Scott: I have a thing from Apple.

386
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:44,737
Scott: That's basically an AC.

387
00:21:44,898 --> 00:21:45,219
Scott: It's an AC.

388
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:47,091
Rym: They took one of those broke it open.

389
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,380
Rym: Yeah figured out what was different.

390
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,951
Rym: It was a couple of resistors to change the voltages slightly.

391
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:51,915
Scott: All right.

392
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:52,960
Rym: Yeah, it's a pretty cool.

393
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:55,438
Scott: Then why then how come a computer works?

394
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,385
Scott: Computers not changing the full?

395
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,551
Rym: I'd recommend you watch the video.

396
00:21:58,571 --> 00:21:59,295
Rym: It's a pretty good.

397
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:00,400
Rym: I don't want it's a long video.

398
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:03,260
Rym: I was watching it as you arrived tonight and we've gone on for a while.

399
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:12,480
Rym: so It's interesting because I think what we need is a universal standard somehow for Chuck Oh USB, huh?

400
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:21,695
Rym: I feel like all devices should have the same way to charge and they should have to handle the circuitry internally Whatever bullshit battery they use and that'll be the end of it.

401
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,499
Rym: We'll just have USB.

402
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,172
Scott: Well, the thing is even depending on what battery you got.

403
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:26,699
Scott: you might need different chart, you know.

404
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,322
Scott: Yeah, you gotta have.

405
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:31,683
Rym: I think the circuitry should be required in the device and maybe you can file for an exception if your device Special.

406
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:35,320
Rym: yeah, China's already trying to mandate universal chargers for all cell phones.

407
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:36,719
Scott: That's a pretty good thing.

408
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:45,288
Rym: Imagine if we got to a point where you have wall outlets, right and you have a USB hole in every wall outlet Just for charging USB enabled charging devices.

409
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,340
Scott: or what if we got to the point where there's no AC power in the wall.

410
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:51,355
Scott: It's just USB everywhere.

411
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,713
Rym: Well That's problematic for a lot of reasons.

412
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:55,819
Rym: I hope you know them.

413
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,676
Rym: So Things of the day.

414
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:09,322
Rym: this is pretty badass.

415
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:13,415
Rym: some Russian guy and he took Photographs from World War.

416
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:21,427
Rym: two black and white real photographs of places found the places the buildings these steps In fact, what about ones that got blowed up?

417
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,078
Rym: Well the he handles that.

418
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:36,309
Rym: he finds the physical location where these photos were taken Takes just a photo in the modern day and kind of maps them together perfectly But leaves the black and white there and made this series of photos entitled the ghosts of World War two.

419
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:40,090
Rym: It is pretty amazing to see these juxtapositions.

420
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:42,952
Rym: this is a really cool photo gallery and Kind of like.

421
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:51,149
Rym: remember that site that would take a picture of a street corner in New York City from like 1902 And then show you a shot from the same angle at the same corner today.

422
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:51,692
Rym: Mm-hmm.

423
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:54,404
Rym: It's the same thing but kind of done even more elegantly.

424
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:55,750
Rym: The first one's the best.

425
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,212
Rym: it's just this.

426
00:23:56,593 --> 00:24:04,561
Rym: this building and these Soviet officers kind of walking down the steps and Around them are just all the tourists at this building in Germany in modern day.

427
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:06,346
Rym: Yeah, it is like a part.

428
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:08,293
Rym: It is so cool I don't.

429
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,619
Rym: there's nothing else I can say about it.

430
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,190
Rym: I mean, I guess I could describe all the pictures.

431
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,514
Rym: You should totally check this out All righty.

432
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:17,910
Scott: So here I have an animated gif gif whatever.

433
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:20,681
Rym: But you think otherwise you are all.

434
00:24:20,862 --> 00:24:27,990
Scott: I say gif but actually Actually, you know, correct term is gif yes, and you know what bullshit cuz jiff is peanut butter.

435
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,512
Rym: You know what?

436
00:24:28,572 --> 00:24:31,019
Rym: The correct term is GNU Linux.

437
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:31,561
Scott: Yeah, fuck.

438
00:24:31,902 --> 00:24:32,343
Scott: No, it's not.

439
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:36,739
Rym: Well then if you say gif You're obligated to say GNU Linux.

440
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:37,161
Scott: No, you're not.

441
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,829
Rym: anyway say gif you can say Linux.

442
00:24:39,655 --> 00:24:40,167
Scott: so the.

443
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:43,630
Scott: Anyway, what if I'm just referring to the Linux kernel and not to the whole thing?

444
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,446
Rym: You have to say the Linux kernel has differentiated from the GNU toolset.

445
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:52,042
Rym: Uh-huh Anyway, I'm curious pull respond in the forums.

446
00:24:52,343 --> 00:24:54,230
Rym: How many of you actually know what we're talking about?

447
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,114
Rym: I'm really curious.

448
00:24:56,155 --> 00:25:02,189
Rym: Let us know if you do in fact know what we're talking about or if you don't say anyway You know the theorem of Pythagoras.

449
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:05,470
Rym: Pythagoras is there about a bag of reading there?

450
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,087
Scott: No about the the the proportion of the sides of a right triangle.

451
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:14,044
Scott: how you know the the hypotenuse will be equal to.

452
00:25:14,285 --> 00:25:19,213
Scott: well the square root of the Hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the non Hypotenuses.

453
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:23,810
Rym: both each squared a squared plus b squared equals c squared is something to that effect that effect, right?

454
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,959
Scott: You know, I learned it in the schools.

455
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,170
Rym: I think in ninth grade into geometry class My eighth grade teacher didn't teach it to us.

456
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:35,070
Rym: I already knew it like everyone in the class knew it but he pointedly would not let us use it until we could prove it.

457
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:39,870
Scott: No, anyway, I learned it in that in you know ninth grade and I learned it pretty quick.

458
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,914
Scott: It was pretty easy to do.

459
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:42,038
Scott: I understood it.

460
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,535
Rym: That was that I cited history textbook as proof And I failed a test.

461
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:53,249
Scott: not not everyone in the class really understood it so quickly You know, we had to keep working on it for quite a while.

462
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:58,010
Rym: But at least think about the difference between math classes and science classes.

463
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:02,230
Rym: No one in the math class was like I. just I'm not convinced.

464
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:05,016
Rym: They always accept it as true.

465
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:09,370
Rym: They might not understand how you got there, but no one's like yeah the theory of Pythagoras.

466
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:14,939
Scott: I'm not buying it Anyway, it's just a theory It's not a fact.

467
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:17,923
Rym: I'm gonna keep measuring him.

468
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:18,549
Rym: I think you're wrong.

469
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:22,061
Scott: But anyway, you know, it's not everyone in the class understood it right away.

470
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:23,465
Scott: and I saw this animated gif here.

471
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:36,502
Scott: Yes, and This image this this little animation pretty much just shows you the Pythagorean theorem and how any Moron can understand why it is true and how it works and all that.

472
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:37,546
Scott: and why didn't?

473
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:43,530
Scott: they could have just showed this to my freaking class And it would've been ten times better than what the old lady teacher was doing.

474
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:49,653
Rym: I'm a big fan of teaching the same thing if it's a complex topic or in public school Even if it's a normal topic.

475
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:55,650
Rym: now teachers to teach the exact same concept three times with like three completely different means.

476
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,657
Rym: Because think about what that'll do for a smart kid.

477
00:26:58,998 --> 00:27:04,158
Rym: It'll show them kind of different applications or different ways to approach For dumb kids.

478
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:06,389
Rym: What are the ways is probably gonna work?

479
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:19,283
Scott: It's win-win Yeah, but this image it's like if you don't understand the Pythagorean theorem and even if you do understand it but you just want to be like Just just like.

480
00:27:19,525 --> 00:27:25,951
Rym: remember that thing in the day I had a long time ago of the three dimensional shape and could you turn it inside out and the proof of how to do It.

481
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:26,815
Scott: it's kind of like that.

482
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,764
Rym: Yeah, only this makes sense.

483
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:29,347
Rym: Fuck that.

484
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:34,226
Scott: Yeah I think all math classes really need to have that sort of and this sort of thing going on.

485
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,537
Rym: well everything class Cool math.

486
00:27:36,597 --> 00:27:38,910
Scott: it's like, you know, this makes math fun.

487
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:39,214
Scott: It's like.

488
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:42,904
Scott: usually math is not fun But this is the kind of thing you see it and you're like, ah, it's fun.

489
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:44,312
Rym: math physics classes Did that.

490
00:27:44,352 --> 00:27:47,947
Rym: they'd always use the simulators where they you know, we'd simulate like the thing falling.

491
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:49,072
Rym: and yeah something You know.

492
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:54,370
Scott: and the thing is it always be a gun shooting a monkey in a tree or an explosion or something like that.

493
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,298
Scott: You know we did so.

494
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,550
Rym: we had to do the monkey experiment.

495
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:57,959
Rym: We know we will know the experience.

496
00:27:57,979 --> 00:27:59,650
Scott: shot a real monkey out of a real tree.

497
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:06,290
Rym: So we did the monkey math and then we set up a gun and a stuffed monkey outside real gun.

498
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:07,915
Rym: It was a BB gun.

499
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:08,337
Scott: Okay.

500
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:09,963
Rym: I was the first second.

501
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:16,620
Scott: I considered lying being like, yeah Yeah, yeah, you should just use you know, you should use though to be far cooler.

502
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,182
Scott: real monkey.

503
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:18,886
Scott: No trebuchet.

504
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,328
Rym: I Wanted to make a trebuchet.

505
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:23,784
Scott: You don't aim the trebuchet at the monkey.

506
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:24,770
Scott: you put the monkey in the trip.

507
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,750
Rym: I also wanted to make a betatron and I came up with plant me and a couple of kids in AP physics.

508
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:34,768
Rym: We're like, we've literally made a droop plans to make a betatron around the football field and the school was like, yeah.

509
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,889
Scott: No Just do it at night.

510
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:40,664
Rym: We needed like five thousand dollars for parts.

511
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:41,749
Scott: So your computer.

512
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:50,526
Rym: Yeah, now I built that computer anyway But yeah, so the metal is a thing of the day.

513
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:53,134
Rym: Yeah, okay Moment.

514
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:54,117
Scott: Oh, I forgot.

515
00:28:54,678 --> 00:28:54,959
Rym: Yes.

516
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,805
Rym: We said the thing Wow unprofessional.

517
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:57,346
Rym: Are we?

518
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:58,670
Scott: what's the book?

519
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:04,290
Rym: The book club book is the red apples of the Sun by Ray Bradbury.

520
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:05,133
Rym: Uh-huh.

521
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:09,306
Scott: We're gonna do a show that Ray Bradbury was at comic-con and was totally awesome.

522
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:09,927
Rym: Of course.

523
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:10,871
Rym: He's totally awesome He's.

524
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,938
Scott: I didn't know he was alive, but he's like 90 something.

525
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,022
Scott: Holy shit, man.

526
00:29:14,263 --> 00:29:16,613
Rym: Ray Bradbury his sci-fi It's.

527
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:18,060
Rym: it amazes me revving discussion.

528
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,708
Scott: That's the real sci-fi right there.

529
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:19,789
Scott: Yep

530
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:31,529
Rym: well, we're having a discussion with some of our friends over the weekend while we're out hiking and Basically, I've realized that the majority of people I know have not actually read very much hard sci-fi at all and

531
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:36,910
Scott: even very much I mean, I've recently learned I used to use the term hard sci-fi incorrectly.

532
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:48,130
Scott: I used to use the term hard sci-fi to separate actual science fiction from Book that just happens to be about outer space or has spacemen in it and isn't actually science.

533
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,411
Scott: You know what?

534
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:56,017
Rym: I've noticed the more space ships and space things are on the cover the less about space it is Unless it's about physics.

535
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:58,989
Scott: Yeah, it's like okay Star Wars not science fiction.

536
00:29:59,049 --> 00:29:59,310
Scott: Really?

537
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,910
Scott: It's it's sort of an adventure story that just happens to be in space with spaceships.

538
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,382
Scott: That doesn't space and spaceships.

539
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:06,370
Scott: don't make it science fiction.

540
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,659
Scott: You could have science fiction without any outer space at all.

541
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,570
Rym: Star Trek much more science fiction, but of course also soap opera.

542
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,412
Scott: Yeah You know.

543
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:20,164
Scott: and then you've got something like brave new world totally science fiction all the way through.

544
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:22,270
Scott: no outer space none zero.

545
00:30:23,131 --> 00:30:38,123
Rym: Anyway, but so, you know, I used to use hard science fiction when I meant But I'm not talking about people reading crap instead of good stuff I just realized that most people if they've read Asimov have maybe read one work.

546
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,009
Rym: if they've right they've most he's got.

547
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:42,077
Scott: so Fucking many is like fucking Tezuka.

548
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:49,786
Rym: Most people I've run into to have never read any Ray Bradbury Yeah, I've met very few people in my life who have read any Bradbury.

549
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:55,423
Rym: Ah Yeah, anyway, yeah, so red apples of the Sun you will enjoy it.

550
00:30:55,484 --> 00:30:58,173
Rym: maybe was golden apples, I think it's red apples I keep forgetting.

551
00:30:58,193 --> 00:30:59,197
Scott: it's apples of the Sun.

552
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,445
Scott: search for Bradbury on freaking Amazon.

553
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:01,665
Rym: Watch.

554
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:02,890
Rym: He's got like 10 Apple books.

555
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,174
Rym: It's the Apple continuum.

556
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:05,277
Rym: I don't know about it.

557
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:07,866
Scott: Anyway, here's some events schedule.

558
00:31:07,926 --> 00:31:09,230
Rym: Otakon was last weekend.

559
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:10,119
Scott: Yes, that's a lot.

560
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:16,197
Scott: We're talking about future events this Saturday August 7th, there's something this Saturday.

561
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:18,024
Scott: Yeah, there's a Mozilla drum beat.

562
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:19,590
Scott: All right in New York City.

563
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,360
Scott: It's a free open-source II kind of event.

564
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,865
Rym: John Britton is gonna be there.

565
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:24,628
Scott: He's running.

566
00:31:24,648 --> 00:31:25,210
Scott: He's organizing.

567
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,480
Scott: Yeah, it's noon to 5 somewhere in New York City.

568
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,222
Scott: Find the website.

569
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:32,046
Rym: I may go but at the same time I may be in Wildwood.

570
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,289
Scott: Friday August 13th, New York City board game night.

571
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:43,968
Rym: Holy shit.

572
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:47,764
Rym: Hopefully soon we can announce this thing.

573
00:31:47,784 --> 00:31:48,327
Rym: We're doing it.

574
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:48,770
Rym: packs.

575
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,219
Scott: Saturday September 11th recess More gaming.

576
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:03,111
Rym: October 8th 9th and 10th fucking everything everything.

577
00:32:03,111 --> 00:32:05,980
Rym: 10 10 10, New York Comic Con New York Festival board game night.

578
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,589
Scott: There's a maker fair in New York City.

579
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:11,258
Scott: I love how we're only giving the New York events.

580
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:14,460
Scott: Like we're not giving nothing else matters.

581
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:22,760
Scott: The I guess it's events we're gonna be at or might be at September 25th and 26 maker fair in New York City.

582
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,260
Scott: There's an open-source Hardware Summit.

583
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:39,964
Rym: I'm probably not gonna go to maybe because during the week on September 23rd I think oh and random meta if anyone this Thursday The 5th of August is going to be at the Scott Pilgrim pre pre pre awesome screening I'll be there with Emily.

584
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:41,489
Rym: So let me know and we'll totally hang out.

585
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:42,352
Rym: Mm-hmm.

586
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:43,837
Scott: I didn't I didn't win tickets.

587
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:45,762
Rym: Yeah, I Won tickets.

588
00:32:45,943 --> 00:32:47,449
Scott: I was like my message Rym.

589
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:48,131
Scott: I'm like, hey Rym.

590
00:32:48,151 --> 00:32:51,310
Rym: There's a chance to win tickets messaging back two minutes later I'm like, yeah, I want some.

591
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,138
Scott: I didn't win any.

592
00:32:53,884 --> 00:33:00,328
Rym: It's alright anyway, so Killbots Yeah, automated killing machine.

593
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:03,039
Scott: I mean this is no one in your bed and watch out.

594
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,733
Rym: This isn't even like far out science fiction.

595
00:33:06,773 --> 00:33:08,359
Rym: We've had kill bots for a long time.

596
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:11,980
Rym: We've had the capability for kill bots for a very long time.

597
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:14,528
Rym: But this this is like right now.

598
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:18,300
Rym: we use automated robotic killing machines to murder humans.

599
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,772
Scott: Well, you know a lot of them are remote-controlled.

600
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:26,010
Scott: even if they're remote-controlled from around the world There's still as a person controlling it manually a lot of the times.

601
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,220
Scott: It's very few that just sort of make their own decisions.

602
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:31,714
Rym: Well, the thing is they exist, but we don't use them.

603
00:33:31,774 --> 00:33:38,676
Rym: I remember a long time ago This was like a decade ago reading about a system and it was designed for two purposes.

604
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:56,658
Rym: The first purpose was Identifying threats of assassination and what it does is if there's ever a gunshot it determines that yes That was a gunshot Determines roughly what kind of gun it was and more importantly it Triangulates and immediately shines a spotlight where the gunshot came from.

605
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:57,863
Scott: Mm-hmm See it could.

606
00:33:57,924 --> 00:34:01,040
Scott: if he can shine a spotlight it could also fire a gun.

607
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:07,420
Scott: There's no there is not does nothing preventing you for making that exact same machine and making it shoot in that direction with a gun.

608
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:11,373
Rym: So it was made that way as well as an area denial system.

609
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:13,639
Rym: Imagine this you're in a war zone in Africa.

610
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,016
Rym: There's a bloody civil war Rwanda situation.

611
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:31,375
Rym: All right one of our at least Scott and I our ideas for peacekeeping is that we sometimes there's probably cause for United Nations peacekeepers to enter an area with the intent of eliminating all active hostiles.

612
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:31,996
Scott: Yeah, they never.

613
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:33,060
Scott: they never shoot anybody.

614
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:35,280
Rym: Yeah, we're talking Gundam double-o style.

615
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,027
Rym: so imagine if there's a situation like that.

616
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:46,280
Rym: you could deploy these systems as area denial to Hostiles and what they would do is in within the area, you know clear warning.

617
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,400
Rym: It's a system if there is gunfire, whatever fired that gun is immediately terminated by a robot.

618
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:53,710
Scott: Alright, so I don't fire a gun.

619
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:55,159
Scott: So it's not gonna shoot me, right?

620
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,093
Scott: If I'm just walking it's not gonna shoot me, right?

621
00:34:58,114 --> 00:34:58,596
Scott: I won't even know.

622
00:34:58,616 --> 00:34:59,300
Rym: you're there doesn't care.

623
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:02,820
Scott: So what prevents you from walking up to it and hitting you with a fucking hammer?

624
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:05,854
Rym: So maybe you have a couple of guards but think of this thing you.

625
00:35:05,874 --> 00:35:07,020
Rym: so you have the system set up.

626
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,786
Scott: So if there's guards, right?

627
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:12,420
Scott: Okay, so here's a gunshot and it aims in the direction of the gunshot and start shooting.

628
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,712
Scott: What if there's a non gunshot a person in the way?

629
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:18,120
Rym: the demonstration I saw was surprisingly accurate.

630
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,462
Rym: You know what?

631
00:35:18,482 --> 00:35:21,039
Rym: if someone's in the way, it's a fucking war zone.

632
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:28,579
Rym: But imagine forget the civilian peacekeeping Ramifications, what if you were a retreating army?

633
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:35,020
Rym: Okay, your area denial systems like that are not nearly as dangerous to civilians as landmines.

634
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:37,084
Scott: Mmm, that's true.

635
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:40,272
Scott: and landmines are automated robot killing machines.

636
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,919
Rym: you put it there someone steps on it fucking kills him.

637
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,780
Rym: How is that any different?

638
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,368
Rym: It doesn't even make a decision.

639
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:50,507
Scott: I think is that the landmine isn't Ranged.

640
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,919
Rym: well, there are range landmines tripwires claymore stuff like that.

641
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,625
Rym: Leave a booby trap behind.

642
00:35:57,685 --> 00:35:59,110
Rym: someone's gonna trip over that someday.

643
00:35:59,130 --> 00:35:59,832
Scott: and it's true.

644
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,560
Scott: and landmines are basically a huge problem, right?

645
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:12,609
Scott: So the the you know that there's still landmines all over the world that are killing people because they're left over from wars long long ago, so wouldn't this be?

646
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,500
Scott: you know a Killing machine with a gun would be even worse if they're left over from wars.

647
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,720
Rym: You know now, of course theoretically the battery is gonna run out into the killing machine with a gun.

648
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:23,140
Scott: Well, it's a bit soon as a battery power.

649
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,531
Rym: But what if it's set up to only attack where gunfire comes from?

650
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,040
Rym: I mean, maybe a hunter will get it.

651
00:36:30,002 --> 00:36:31,347
Rym: Yeah, but a little kid won't?

652
00:36:31,467 --> 00:36:32,652
Rym: little kids not gonna get shot.

653
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:34,319
Scott: well the little kids got like a BB gun.

654
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:37,532
Rym: I I think it could tell the difference.

655
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:39,320
Scott: I don't know what if he's got a cap gun?

656
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,259
Rym: What if he's got a gun?

657
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,100
Scott: So, I think we really really that funny.

658
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:52,473
Rym: I think what we really need to do is because they're We need to narrow this a little bit because there's a difference between.

659
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:56,580
Rym: kind of like in the stock trading market There are hot low latency traders.

660
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:04,780
Rym: these are where a human decides buy this or sell that you know execute this strategy and then Algorithms just execute the strategy as perfectly as possible.

661
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:11,000
Rym: Then there's high frequency trading where computers decide both what the strategy is and how to execute it.

662
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:13,934
Rym: Mm-hmm and with kill bots is kind of the same thing.

663
00:37:14,377 --> 00:37:15,562
Rym: right now We have drones.

664
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:18,630
Scott: the situation where someone's controlling the drones though, right?

665
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,580
Rym: Yes a robot will identify threats or do something to that effect.

666
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,805
Rym: let's just let's forget about the current.

667
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:36,991
Rym: let's talk about the theoretical a robot that is armed that identifies threats and Presents them to a human remote operator and a human makes the final say of kill or not kill Mm-hmm, that is kind of automated execution.

668
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:39,519
Scott: They're actually more remote controlling and like it's a video game.

669
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:53,459
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but still there's I think the clear like the line we should differentiate is Automated killing machine where a human makes the kill or not kill decision Versus automated killing machine that has the discretion to kill on its own.

670
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:56,128
Rym: Which one do I talk about first?

671
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,640
Rym: Well, there's obviously the more interesting one.

672
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:06,451
Scott: Well, no, but even the ones where a human is making this decision The human is very much separated from the decision right?

673
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:14,620
Scott: You know, you could even like let's say You know just theoretically I made a machine where you make the kill or not kill decision, right?

674
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:23,312
Scott: But the video it displays is an actual video or maybe even if it is actual video It just always shows a picture of a crazy guy running at you with a gun.

675
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:30,505
Scott: Yeah, if we have some sort of technology Enders game You know, it's like, you know You don't think you might.

676
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:35,161
Scott: I might be able to trick you into thinking it's a video game when it's actually for real and now You're killing people.

677
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:50,449
Rym: I would argue that that's almost an entirely separate debate the question of whether or not the System that is killing is Actually verifiable to the people using it, you know, if there's some layer of deception that's independent of the technology.

678
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:53,047
Rym: almost That's more of a government corruption issue.

679
00:38:55,231 --> 00:39:01,510
Rym: Well, you know, it's it's it's possible but I mean at the same time you can order soldiers go wipe out that village.

680
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:08,550
Scott: We know they're terrorists Yeah, but at least if they know, you know, if if a soldier knows what he's doing, right?

681
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:13,390
Scott: I mean theoretically, you know, you're supposed to like, you know, not follow the evil order, right?

682
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:23,134
Scott: Like if some if you're if only the illegal order Someone if someone fought tell orders you to violate the Geneva Convention, right you you as a soldier you can not do it.

683
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:24,960
Scott: you might just get shot, but you can.

684
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:27,187
Scott: you're supposed to on paper not do it.

685
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:36,026
Scott: and But what if you are violating the Geneva Convention and you don't even know it you're gonna do it Even though you would have if you had known not done it.

686
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:47,111
Scott: So thus there can be war crimes by people who didn't even know they were committing war crimes and would not have committed war crimes Had they known they were doing it, but but to back up a little bit There was.

687
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:52,650
Rym: there's a lot of evidence that being remote because that was your first argument that being remote can also.

688
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:54,489
Rym: You know it colors things in so many ways.

689
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:59,508
Rym: being remote leads to much more calculated decisions that aren't based on adrenaline.

690
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:09,329
Rym: a human soldier in a situation where there's someone who may be a civilian or maybe a hostile is Going to protect their own life above all other concerns.

691
00:40:10,232 --> 00:40:16,670
Rym: So if the situation is ambiguous or dangerous, they are much more likely to kill even if killing wasn't necessary.

692
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:18,535
Rym: Piloting a drone one.

693
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:20,320
Rym: You've got an officer over your shoulder.

694
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,944
Rym: Someone's watching what you're doing.

695
00:40:22,405 --> 00:40:25,547
Rym: Every movement is being recorded and You're safe.

696
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:33,590
Rym: The worst-case scenario of you not firing it for you is my drone blows up and I take a coffee break.

697
00:40:34,212 --> 00:40:44,709
Scott: No, I've actually heard that the guys you know who are working the drones actually have a lot of psychological difficulties It but I haven't seen any study that says those are more so than the soldiers in the field.

698
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:46,157
Scott: That's true.

699
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:48,512
Scott: Yeah It's.

700
00:40:48,653 --> 00:40:49,497
Scott: it's just you know, it's.

701
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:51,467
Scott: it's not like you're eliminating that problem though.

702
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:58,837
Rym: Oh not at all But at least it's just as rough, but at least you're either way the personal like the self-preservation Problem of.

703
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:11,830
Rym: I don't want to die Mmm because I can very rarely blame a soldier who thinks he might be in danger Hurting someone even if that you know, you can still have the same situation where you know, maybe you're saving someone else's life.

704
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:15,010
Scott: You know you think I need to because that person will die.

705
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,290
Rym: Yeah, but those situations happen with soldiers in person, too.

706
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:33,208
Rym: But there is a lot of evidence that removing soldiers from themselves being in personal danger limits the the amount of Influence of self-preservation instinct and reduces the number of kind of violations or incidents that went poorly.

707
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:33,689
Rym: Mm-hmm.

708
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:39,868
Scott: But if it's a computer and is no soldier involved at all, so that's an entirely separate situation.

709
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:40,630
Scott: and you got a problem.

710
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:43,670
Rym: We just say it's like in populace when I send the night into the other guy's side.

711
00:41:43,992 --> 00:41:47,330
Rym: It's automated and it just fucking kills people until it falls in the swamp.

712
00:41:49,711 --> 00:41:52,038
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know the computer.

713
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:59,510
Scott: even if you could program it somehow perfectly right it wouldn't have any of those problems Doing anything in the heat of the moment or anything like that.

714
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:04,430
Scott: You could even program it to follow the Geneva Convention, you know in a some sci-fi world, right?

715
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,398
Scott: So it would never do any.

716
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:06,730
Scott: it would never make a war crime.

717
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:13,570
Rym: Well, it would never make a war crime in the same sense that the three laws prevented robots from ever hurting humans?

718
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:14,810
Scott: Yeah, exactly, right.

719
00:42:15,091 --> 00:42:18,926
Scott: You know what happens if it breaks or fucks up or who knows what?

720
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:20,010
Rym: what if a tank fucks up?

721
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,358
Rym: What if a soldier goes crazy?

722
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:23,050
Rym: Well, it's a lot harder soldiers going.

723
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,959
Rym: It's not a lot harder for a soldier to go crazy.

724
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:27,190
Scott: No, but it's hard for a tank to fuck up, right?

725
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:34,915
Scott: I mean, you know a tank doesn't just fire it can't fire its gun accidentally really, you know, so it has to be loaded You know mechanically.

726
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:36,520
Rym: so what if we get to a point where we can?

727
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:46,894
Rym: our programming is not perfect and the robots kill in Mistake, but they kill in mistake objectively less often than humans Then what then?

728
00:42:46,974 --> 00:42:49,461
Rym: aren't we morally obligated to use the robots instead?

729
00:42:49,802 --> 00:42:52,950
Scott: Yeah, but I think people are obviously more disturbed by any.

730
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:53,873
Scott: You know miss.

731
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:56,482
Scott: it's like you make one mistake with some new tech.

732
00:42:56,542 --> 00:42:57,184
Scott: It's like air.

733
00:42:57,465 --> 00:42:58,850
Scott: It's like one plane crash, right?

734
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,378
Scott: How often are plane crashes so rare so rare?

735
00:43:01,438 --> 00:43:05,410
Scott: how often our car crashes so common every day tons of them all over the place.

736
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:09,833
Scott: But when you hear about car crashes like a car crash plane crash Oh my god.

737
00:43:09,873 --> 00:43:15,170
Scott: now granted the damage of a plane crash is much larger, but people go crazy even over like these Cessna.

738
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:21,030
Scott: You know accidents which actually probably have less damage than you know a car crash on the highway.

739
00:43:21,614 --> 00:43:30,072
Scott: But people are so scared and Incredibly frightened and it's huge news when there's a plane crash even a small one and a car crash is like back page Right.

740
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:35,510
Scott: So a robot even making one mistake would be fuck get the robots out of here.

741
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,112
Scott: Oh my god.

742
00:43:36,172 --> 00:43:40,204
Scott: killing robots, but a person fucking up but human.

743
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:42,250
Rym: that's one of the things that always bothers me.

744
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,279
Rym: It's in your history books.

745
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,390
Scott: It's not even in the newspaper.

746
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:54,108
Rym: We can't always do the obvious Objectively correct or objectively better thing because people have preconceived notions prejudices and irrational affairs.

747
00:43:54,429 --> 00:43:55,929
Rym: Yes I don't know what to do about that.

748
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,517
Rym: I mean like look at how we execute.

749
00:43:57,537 --> 00:44:06,726
Rym: we should program a robot to kill anyone with the rational that we as Enlightened society to this day think that lethal injection is somehow more humane than I don't know.

750
00:44:06,787 --> 00:44:10,638
Rym: carbon monoxide poisoning Or the boulder method.

751
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,383
Scott: What's the boulder?

752
00:44:12,423 --> 00:44:13,707
Rym: drop a boulder on someone?

753
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:14,289
Scott: All right.

754
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:17,118
Rym: Yeah Or even firing squad.

755
00:44:17,138 --> 00:44:22,450
Scott: yeah, as long as they have aim, yeah They suck at aiming.

756
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,856
Scott: I mean they might just shoot you in the junk.

757
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:24,317
Scott: and then what?

758
00:44:24,438 --> 00:44:31,029
Rym: and John the serial killers died of eight gunshot wounds to the heart and one to the testicle.

759
00:44:32,855 --> 00:44:36,295
Scott: That's some good aim You know.

760
00:44:36,336 --> 00:44:37,803
Scott: considering, you know how small.

761
00:44:38,165 --> 00:44:45,376
Rym: so even you know The far-out discussion is what about when we just send robots off to do everything for us Robots versus robots.

762
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,964
Scott: We're just building robots to fight other robots, right?

763
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:48,667
Rym: Should we?

764
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:49,710
Rym: well now we could have that.

765
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,836
Rym: Anyway, should we be concerned?

766
00:44:52,558 --> 00:44:55,807
Rym: I mean it's we're from the perspective of we're the superpower.

767
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:58,976
Rym: We're in America We have the best military technology.

768
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,540
Rym: There is far and away.

769
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,730
Rym: We're the ones using this technology against people who can't have it.

770
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:09,708
Rym: I mean, there are no more wars between two fully industrialized modern civilizations.

771
00:45:09,768 --> 00:45:10,510
Rym: It just doesn't happen.

772
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,768
Rym: Hmm I don't know if it'll ever happen again, I don't know.

773
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:21,069
Scott: But no one wants to get into a fight where that's actually gonna be a real fair fight You know, they only want to get into a fight where they pick on some wuss.

774
00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:30,270
Rym: I mean imagine a war between two nations that have force projection capabilities and carrier fleets and drones and nuclear weapons and cruise missiles.

775
00:45:31,191 --> 00:45:32,477
Rym: But that never happens.

776
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:35,510
Rym: I mean we wage war against countries that don't even have night vision.

777
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:47,090
Rym: So Morally is there a concern from the fact that we're moving toward a military where there is no danger to any human on our side.

778
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:48,633
Scott: There is it.

779
00:45:48,693 --> 00:45:58,047
Scott: there is danger to humans on our side because they just use you know different tactics like, you know Putting a you know bomb and you know on the road or whatever that you know, it works.

780
00:45:58,248 --> 00:45:59,150
Scott: They're getting us All right.

781
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:08,290
Rym: So what if we we eliminate that by we say we occupy a country and I have just you know We have robots in the surrogate style.

782
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:11,220
Rym: So it's so no, let's go full-on.

783
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:13,250
Rym: Let's go all the way out because it's the why it's the sir.

784
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,254
Scott: We have a surrogate army.

785
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,438
Rym: Yes, we have a surrogate arms.

786
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,924
Scott: All right, it's all the major.

787
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:20,557
Rym: so we can wage Warfare the same way that we do now.

788
00:46:20,637 --> 00:46:34,190
Rym: we can occupy we can help people we humanitarian aid everything But at no point is any soldier from our country in any danger of physical harm More so than maybe a paper cut when they fill out their time sheet.

789
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,052
Scott: All right.

790
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:37,580
Rym: Well, you're ignoring of course psychological trauma.

791
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:40,990
Rym: We're ignoring that then because that's kind of a separate that happens now.

792
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:46,950
Scott: Anyway, well if you got that and no one else has that then you just basically you can just conquer the world.

793
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:47,775
Scott: No one can stop you.

794
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:50,150
Rym: But what does conquering mean in the modern world?

795
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:55,050
Scott: It means it's gonna be one government for the entire world because you just know because we probably wouldn't do that because doesn't mean much.

796
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,952
Scott: Yeah, I know It's so.

797
00:46:57,313 --> 00:47:03,070
Rym: I mean imagine now if you're what would the Iraq War be an issue if it just cost money and time?

798
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:07,010
Scott: It would because what about these Iraqis that are dying?

799
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,257
Scott: It doesn't mean that Iraqi civilians are gonna get killed.

800
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:12,730
Rym: You people in the American political discourse even are concerned with that.

801
00:47:13,072 --> 00:47:14,078
Scott: That's because they're horrible people.

802
00:47:14,118 --> 00:47:14,441
Scott: Yes.

803
00:47:14,783 --> 00:47:15,789
Rym: Yes, exactly.

804
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:19,162
Rym: But would we possibly be in a worse situation?

805
00:47:19,182 --> 00:47:20,849
Rym: like would we be able to?

806
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:33,329
Rym: Would war be able to be waged effectively eternally if there was no longer in the American political objective like consensus Any factor of kids not coming home from the war?

807
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:39,490
Scott: Oh, you're kidding They would go they would do even more war because a it would be mad monies for our economy.

808
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:50,510
Scott: It was really if we were using all this tax money to get basically get jobs by people manufacturing Argues that war is the health of the state, but I don't know if that's necessarily true economically.

809
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:52,278
Rym: I think the real concern.

810
00:47:52,298 --> 00:47:53,363
Rym: I mean what if instead?

811
00:47:53,423 --> 00:47:59,090
Rym: All right, our Perspective there is skewed by the fact that we had Republicans who waged two foreign wars of aggression.

812
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:08,368
Rym: what if we have a surrogate army and we Engage in the kind of peacekeeping that is infeasible now because people aren't willing to risk their lives for it?

813
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:13,390
Rym: Would Rwanda have been able to happen if the US or the UN had a surrogate army?

814
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,860
Scott: Well, Rwanda didn't even need to happen without a surrogate army.

815
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,750
Scott: It was a matter of you know laws and things, you know It was simply a matter of political expediency.

816
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:26,007
Rym: Yeah States did not want to get involved because we had already fucked up.

817
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:32,680
Rym: a bunch of other UN guys were there couldn't do anything because the Because no one wanted to risk UN lives.

818
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,170
Rym: and yet what if it was just money and not humans?

819
00:48:37,232 --> 00:48:42,334
Scott: alright, so now we spend all our money making robots and But it cost the same.

820
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:43,598
Rym: we've changed the equation.

821
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:57,829
Rym: the equation now for getting involved in a peacekeeping war for the United States even forget the United Nations is Soldiers will die which limits the scope and span of the war because political unrest increases the more soldiers die.

822
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:00,054
Rym: and Independently, we have the cost.

823
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:03,829
Rym: What if it was just the money cost and not the human cost on the on our side?

824
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:14,675
Scott: So what happens when the people on the other side like, you know You know, okay, so we send a bunch of robots over there and they dismantle all the robots But the robots do the same thing.

825
00:49:14,695 --> 00:49:15,237
Rym: the humans do.

826
00:49:15,277 --> 00:49:18,670
Scott: that's the same as dismantling a soldier and they're doing pretty good job of that.

827
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:19,633
Rym: How could they though?

828
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:21,138
Rym: We're effectively unbeatable.

829
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:21,961
Scott: How are you?

830
00:49:22,182 --> 00:49:24,590
Scott: You're not unbeatable just cuz you're just cuz you're a robot.

831
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:25,735
Rym: It's not just cuz you're a robot.

832
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:27,502
Rym: It's a robot with the same advanced.

833
00:49:27,823 --> 00:49:29,430
Rym: I mean, it's just take our current military.

834
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:33,769
Scott: The only thing is alright, so if it's a robot actually has even more weaknesses cuz you can just hack it.

835
00:49:34,893 --> 00:49:36,994
Scott: You know, it's not the same as a soldier Is that?

836
00:49:37,196 --> 00:49:38,386
Rym: is that even an option?

837
00:49:38,466 --> 00:49:38,870
Scott: you could you know?

838
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,298
Scott: If it's a surrogate right you assume someone's can.

839
00:49:41,399 --> 00:49:45,394
Scott: if it's like the surrogates and someone's controlling it from far away laws of physics You can jam it.

840
00:49:45,454 --> 00:49:46,942
Scott: You can take it offline.

841
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:48,670
Scott: You can just you know, lock it up somewhere.

842
00:49:49,794 --> 00:49:52,182
Rym: Look at the asymmetry of the warfare currently.

843
00:49:52,203 --> 00:49:54,290
Rym: take our current army to replace it with surrogates.

844
00:49:54,751 --> 00:50:10,719
Rym: We're fighting against combatants who do not have access to any of the countermeasures for our technology I mean our stealth technology Especially the older stuff works primarily because it's trivially defeated by our military and modern militaries But their militaries can't see those planes.

845
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:17,950
Scott: So it's not really that it's just one It's basically then it's the same as we have now plus one, you know, it's not way to look at it.

846
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,497
Scott: It's not really a big difference.

847
00:50:19,537 --> 00:50:21,306
Scott: It's like, okay, we have so much technology.

848
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:22,170
Scott: They can't compete with us.

849
00:50:22,432 --> 00:50:24,110
Scott: So what if we had even more technology?

850
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:25,978
Scott: They would have it even a harder time competing with us.

851
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:32,070
Rym: really what it comes down to our use of drones Basically reduces the cost and the risk of warfare.

852
00:50:32,652 --> 00:50:38,710
Rym: But otherwise, it's just one factor in a long litany of the fact that we have total world military supremacy.

853
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:41,170
Scott: No, China could put up a fight.

854
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,090
Rym: They don't have any force projection capabilities.

855
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:48,170
Rym: And if spending patterns continue unless we hit kind of theoretical limits they got nukes.

856
00:50:48,991 --> 00:50:52,190
Rym: Yes, but I don't think that you can project a nuke anywhere in the world.

857
00:50:52,310 --> 00:51:01,830
Rym: But that's a different kind of force projection and I don't think it is possible to have war nuclear war among ICBM capable nations at least not for the foreseeable future.

858
00:51:02,752 --> 00:51:06,070
Scott: Yeah, I don't think anyone's really thinking about it because it there's nothing to gain.

859
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:06,713
Rym: It's kind of the.

860
00:51:06,753 --> 00:51:08,802
Rym: that's like the game over situation.

861
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:12,970
Scott: if I would basically, you know It costs so much money to maintain them, right?

862
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:18,402
Scott: I would you know and what I would do is if I was in charge is I would basically just stop maintaining them But pretend I was.

863
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:25,089
Scott: You know save all that money and use them on robots or something and then I would everyone still thinks I got him.

864
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:33,201
Rym: You know, but that's interesting because in the old world, you know the Cold War Game theory, you know, that is where a lot of our modern game theory came out of.

865
00:51:33,543 --> 00:51:35,530
Rym: is what do we do in the Cold War?

866
00:51:35,991 --> 00:51:37,722
Rym: That was just a big paper rock.

867
00:51:37,742 --> 00:51:38,467
Rym: Fuck you game.

868
00:51:38,608 --> 00:51:41,553
Rym: Yep So Paper rock.

869
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:41,874
Rym: Fuck you.

870
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:43,321
Rym: We should play that instead of paper rock scissors.

871
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:43,984
Scott: All right, I'll pick.

872
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:45,170
Scott: fuck you every time as will I.

873
00:51:46,694 --> 00:51:56,349
Rym: We appear to be at an impasse But but there was the argument that the primary reason to have nuclear weapons is to never use them But that they are a deterrent from other people using nuclear weapons.

874
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:02,470
Scott: so The best possible scenario maybe having robots could be a deterrent against anyone else.

875
00:52:03,092 --> 00:52:14,690
Rym: The best possible scenario is the other nation your enemies believing you have the capability to destroy them and Acting accordingly and yet you don't actually have this case and you save your money for something better.

876
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:25,624
Rym: The worst case scenario is you having the capability and them not thinking that you do Mmm, because think about it then they will act in ways that might force you to use it.

877
00:52:25,644 --> 00:52:36,077
Rym: Mmm because they don't think you have it And then the only way to use it the only way to prove that you have it is to use it Mm-hmm, and we could go on about that.

878
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:38,064
Scott: create an illusion that you have it when you don't.

879
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:41,035
Rym: yes like in the mouse that roared You can make a show.

880
00:52:41,236 --> 00:52:43,485
Rym: remember that movie with the cue bomb with the crazy people.

881
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:44,490
Rym: Yeah, and the cue bomb?

882
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,352
Scott: I forgot the name of that movie, but I Roared.

883
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:48,456
Rym: or the mouse that wrote at the line.

884
00:52:48,476 --> 00:52:50,747
Rym: I think it had a longer title, but it's the mouse that roared.

885
00:52:50,947 --> 00:52:54,564
Rym: Yeah Regardless, so I think what I would do?

886
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:55,330
Rym: I'd go something similar.

887
00:52:55,431 --> 00:53:03,370
Rym: I would maintain a top-secret Hyper like a continued advancement of you know mass destruction nuclear technology.

888
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:10,950
Rym: But I would maintain a very small advanced actual capability and a very large perceived capability.

889
00:53:13,254 --> 00:53:21,130
Scott: But yeah, I mean if it's robots right and someone else gets the robots right then what can happen is any nation get the robots.

890
00:53:21,612 --> 00:53:28,198
Rym: That wasn't an industrialized nation such that they would never wage war with another modern Let's say it was the war of the robots.

891
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:32,437
Scott: the robots first the robots right and it's like okay You so could that be just a proxy war?

892
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:33,782
Scott: no, but here's the thing.

893
00:53:33,822 --> 00:53:35,730
Scott: So let's say there's robots versus robots, right?

894
00:53:35,831 --> 00:53:38,670
Scott: It's like okay you look at the other guy and you say dude, really?

895
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:43,550
Scott: It's like we're just spending money on robots that are destroyed or basically both flushing money down the toilet.

896
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:44,996
Scott: Why are we even doing this?

897
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:48,269
Scott: Let's just stop and the thing is like, okay you stop.

898
00:53:48,509 --> 00:53:50,777
Scott: now The robots are killing your non-robot people.

899
00:53:50,938 --> 00:53:53,447
Scott: Haha because they you didn't put any robots in the way to stop them.

900
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:56,576
Scott: So It's it's like on the one hand.

901
00:53:56,617 --> 00:53:57,600
Scott: It's completely silly.

902
00:53:58,022 --> 00:54:02,509
Scott: you got you know, one or more groups Spending money on robots that kill each other.

903
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:08,467
Scott: But if any one person stops spending the money suddenly those robots are now killing people and it's just like.

904
00:54:08,988 --> 00:54:10,563
Rym: I don't think it'll ever Get to the shock of Zulu's.

905
00:54:10,603 --> 00:54:16,290
Scott: we're forced We're forced to do this stupid thing of flushing money down the toilet because the other guy is also doing it.

906
00:54:16,591 --> 00:54:23,073
Scott: We can't convince them both to stop because if only one, you know, it's this prisoner's dilemma if I stop and he continues He's killing me.

907
00:54:23,354 --> 00:54:23,735
Scott: I'm done.

908
00:54:24,317 --> 00:54:28,650
Scott: But if we both continue then we're both sucking, you know, it's almost oversimplified.

909
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,236
Scott: we can't get the people to both.

910
00:54:30,296 --> 00:54:31,038
Scott: continue to stop.

911
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:32,744
Rym: you have to think about what is.

912
00:54:32,805 --> 00:54:43,498
Rym: what is the purpose of warfare and Warfare between two modern industrialized societies is very different from the vast majority of warfare That is engaged in the world.

913
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,830
Rym: Usually it would be peacekeeping operations.

914
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:51,747
Rym: It would be one large power fighting against a small power that is causing harm to its neighbors.

915
00:54:52,028 --> 00:54:52,630
Rym: things like that.

916
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:57,989
Rym: It's not going to be two equivalent nations sending robots to fight in Antarctica for a hundred years.

917
00:54:59,411 --> 00:55:00,556
Scott: It's so good, Antarctica.

918
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:02,242
Rym: What are they fighting over now?

919
00:55:02,604 --> 00:55:04,210
Scott: running over Antarctica, dude?

920
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:06,433
Scott: Force.

921
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:13,970
Rym: a war between two modern industrialized societies could be the resource war situation Mm-hmm, but even then they're fighting over something.

922
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,243
Rym: There is a there is a victory condition other than I defeated your robot army.

923
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:20,490
Rym: It's never I defeated your robot army.

924
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:24,750
Rym: It's always I defeated your robot army in order to get the vuvuzela.

925
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:28,216
Scott: Mmm, I gotta get me some vuvuzela.

926
00:55:28,557 --> 00:55:28,877
Rym: Really?

927
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:30,301
Rym: That's really what you want.

928
00:55:30,822 --> 00:55:32,928
Rym: No, I think anyone wants that.

929
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:36,840
Scott: you do Vuvuzela, oh man vuvuzela robot of war.

930
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,890
Scott: they just go out and they just they have built-in vuvuzela.

931
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:46,871
Scott: I mean that is more deadly than any weapon that has ever existed and just roams around your country with who's willing and you can't Stop it.

932
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:48,015
Scott: It's unstoppable.

933
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:49,320
Rym: We should make that.

934
00:55:49,581 --> 00:55:56,581
Rym: you know how much press that would get if we just made a vuvuzela bot It'd be on slash shot and BB spot and boing boing.

935
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:57,063
Scott: We need like.

936
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,030
Scott: we need like an air compressor and a read.

937
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:01,234
Rym: It's not read driven.

938
00:56:01,254 --> 00:56:01,857
Rym: We need a fake.

939
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:02,319
Rym: No.

940
00:56:02,379 --> 00:56:04,990
Scott: No, we need yeah, basically the reeves reads to me.

941
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:05,653
Rym: I would do.

942
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:08,990
Rym: I would just put a speaker in the end of the vuvuzela the place of a vuvuzela sound.

943
00:56:09,572 --> 00:56:10,094
Scott: Would that work?

944
00:56:10,295 --> 00:56:10,556
Scott: Yeah.

945
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:12,443
Rym: Yeah slightly modified.

946
00:56:12,483 --> 00:56:13,266
Rym: So we're when it comes out.

947
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,710
Rym: It sounds like the vuvuzela All right.

948
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:21,092
Scott: So you blow the vuvuzela we put a microphone on the other end and then we take the speaker and we you know You stop and

949
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:30,021
Rym: I think the real presentation of it is making the rest of the robot that roams the street identifying faces Approaching people and then vuvuzeling them in the face.

950
00:56:30,503 --> 00:56:32,610
Scott: We could just use any old wheeled robot to do that.

951
00:56:32,971 --> 00:56:34,275
Rym: Yeah, but no one's done it.

952
00:56:35,098 --> 00:56:35,259
Scott: Nope.

953
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:36,021
Rym: Luckily.

954
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:37,085
Rym: We have not weaponized this.

955
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,068
Scott: Yeah, let's do it.

956
00:56:39,351 --> 00:56:39,613
