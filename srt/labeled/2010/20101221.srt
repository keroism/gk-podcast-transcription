1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,717
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, December 21st, 2010.

2
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:12,021
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:13,065
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:14,750
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,517
Scott: Bomberman Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:29,805
Rym: So it turns out that I had in fact come like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revelers and the Blood Badoon.

7
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:29,906
Rym: What?

8
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:32,525
Rym: So I I got sick.

9
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:33,692
Scott: Is there a plague situation?

10
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:43,417
Rym: I got sick and I stayed home from work for like two days and then I went to work and I got everyone at work sick and Emily got sick and Scott got sick.

11
00:00:43,598 --> 00:00:48,035
Rym: and Awesome Pax Enforcer Aaron Clark who was out visiting in New York for the week got sick.

12
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:49,260
Scott: I'm not really that sick.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,718
Scott: I mean my throat was just kind of bleh, but I wasn't feverish or you know, I can operate.

14
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:54,140
Rym: Wait, wait, wait.

15
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:55,849
Rym: So your throat was bleh today.

16
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:01,773
Scott: It was all it's been bleh But today it was especially bleh and then it unbleed mostly.

17
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:04,504
Rym: You'll find out tomorrow's D-Day You might wake up.

18
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:06,415
Scott: That's the thing I hate about throatiness, right?

19
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:06,676
Scott: Is it?

20
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,203
Scott: you go to sleep You're laying down.

21
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:11,175
Scott: the gravity stops working for you, right?

22
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:15,444
Scott: And then when you wake up in the morning It's the worst but then when you stand up for a few hours It fixes.

23
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:27,192
Rym: As a veteran of sinus infections as in fact Perhaps an expert in the field at least in the field of accepting and dealing with sinus infections I can say this you take yourself some mucinex at night.

24
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:28,697
Rym: No problems in the morning.

25
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:32,178
Scott: Yeah Yeah, this is a throat situation.

26
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,643
Rym: Yeah Mucinex fixes the throat.

27
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:40,223
Rym: Because you realize why the throat gets irritated is that you got mucus just constantly going down the throat irritating it Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:45,504
Rym: So the way around is the mucinex thins the mucus and at the same time prevents the mucus from coming out Uh-huh.

29
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:47,272
Rym: So as a result the throat doesn't get irritated.

30
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:47,754
Rym: you're good to go.

31
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:48,960
Scott: But I gotta get the real mucinex.

32
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:54,756
Rym: I got enough to where I was barred from buying more pseudoephedrine a month ago.

33
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:57,708
Rym: Until January 1st I have bought the federal limit.

34
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,879
Scott: Do they look it up like in the computer every time?

35
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:03,897
Rym: Yes I gotta swipe my driver's license at the Duane Reade and they're like, "Sir, you can't buy any more

36
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:04,359
Rym: pseudoephed.".

37
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:07,450
Rym: Yeah, I argued with him and then I had to go.

38
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,554
Scott: I'll go buy some.

39
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,602
Rym: It's a felony for me to ask you to buy It for me.

40
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:11,830
Scott: No, I'll go buy some.

41
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:12,473
Scott: For me?

42
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:13,419
Scott: You didn't ask me for it.

43
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,565
Rym: Okay You just buy some.

44
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:15,410
Scott: I'm not buying it for me.

45
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,320
Rym: You buy some independently and if I need it.

46
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,767
Rym: I might just steal it from you.

47
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:24,917
Scott: Well that's illegal stealing it from me Because we got a big meth lab going on here.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,394
Scott: That's why we go to work every day because we got a meth lab.

49
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:29,419
Rym: Let's go to work.

50
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,166
Rym: Yeah So we're we're doing okay.

51
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,811
Rym: A little low energy here.

52
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:37,340
Scott: Speaking of medicine, get this, right?

53
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,212
Scott: So there was like a letter in the mail, right?

54
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,880
Scott: And it had like this NYU logo on it.

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,075
Scott: So I mostly ignored it and then I opened it and it was actually.

56
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:52,887
Scott: it wasn't from NYU You know, it was actually from the doctor I went to who happened to be like associated with NYU You know, the practice.

57
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,135
Scott: And you know what it said?

58
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:54,780
Rym: What did it say?

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,758
Scott: Well, I'm a doctor and I'm gonna go become a director of doctors down in Florida and I'm like no I should send you some blackjack.

60
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:14,476
Scott: I was like cuz like it took me forever to find a doctor who wasn't a schmuck and then he goes to become You know some you know, the doctor, the director of some hospital or something.

61
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:15,860
Rym: You realize what he's really doing.

62
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,309
Rym: He's going on to have an okie or a sawa plot.

63
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,232
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

64
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,380
Rym: It's totally he's chasing the monster.

65
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:27,200
Scott: It's totally gonna be an evil Hospital Tezuka or a sawa manga plot.

66
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,300
Rym: Well, then the master Keaton looking good guy is gonna come up here and talk to you one day like remember doctor so-and-so.

67
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:32,843
Scott: But it's like.

68
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:35,840
Scott: I went to this doctor once and I was like, oh finally a doctor who's not a quack.

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,528
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna go I gotta go find a different doctor.

70
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:39,880
Rym: You're gonna get to be the one-off side character.

71
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:42,729
Scott: I'm not even he's got his thousands of patients.

72
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,873
Rym: Yeah, you'll be the one.

73
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:54,489
Scott: Okay the way that works He's you know, he helped me with my barely any illnesses once And because I survived But I do.

74
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:57,849
Rym: before we get onto the news and everything I want to give a shout out because we did have Aaron Clark.

75
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,015
Rym: It's funny because we know.

76
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:05,620
Rym: to Aaron Clark's There's the awesome one who is like the super enforcer packs that and his evil non-twin.

77
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:10,198
Rym: Yeah, the other Aaron Clark works for Otakon and said that it shouldn't be fun to volunteer for cons.

78
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:10,660
Scott: That's right.

79
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,060
Scott: They're like polar opposite Aaron Clark and the other one is the awesomest con volunteer who has more fun.

80
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,659
Rym: You may know him if you're at PAX.

81
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,600
Rym: There's one enforcer above all the others.

82
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,920
Rym: The main theater a real kilts in the main theater as opposed to a utility kilt.

83
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:28,579
Scott: Is his actual position like head of main theater legit something like that head of kilts?

84
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,100
Scott: Yeah, basically real kills not you.

85
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:34,940
Rym: So we were gonna do a show with him on like helicoptering because that's one of the things he does.

86
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,750
Rym: Well, the thing he does yeah sickness got in the way.

87
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,837
Rym: So we'll Skype him in at some point in the future.

88
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:43,452
Scott: talk about helicopters Yeah, but basically he could talk about helicopters for like forever.

89
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:45,360
Scott: I learned as long as we could talk about computers.

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,431
Rym: I learned a lot about helicopters.

91
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:50,164
Scott: I am now sated in my Helicopter knowledge.

92
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:51,288
Rym: I'm mostly sated.

93
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,718
Rym: I want to learn more about these double rotor ones.

94
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:58,030
Scott: now suddenly Well, you told me that the blades actually spin in the opposite direction, right?

95
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,697
Rym: Which sounds far scarier, right.

96
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:06,876
Scott: and the Because the blades are like at an angle they'll never hit each other regardless of like the timing.

97
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:12,069
Scott: It's not a timing thing It's just that you know because they bend when you go up and down So they'll always be bending in the same way.

98
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,040
Scott: So they in their angles that gonna it'll be cool.

99
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:24,500
Rym: So one game one kind of game that I like is the sports game, but of all the sports games to this day Not counting Super Techno ball ice hockey and ice hockey.

100
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:31,547
Rym: The best games are actually the Mario sports games because they're not that realistic But they I feel like they capture Mario.

101
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:36,060
Scott: Mario Tennis and Mario soccer strikers are you know are good?

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,204
Scott: I don't know about that baseball one.

103
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:38,489
Scott: I never really played that enough.

104
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,754
Rym: I played it a little bit.

105
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:40,156
Rym: It was fun.

106
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:50,036
Rym: Yeah, the trouble with the Mario baseball was that I Think Super Baseball Simulator 1000 is a better game.

107
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:59,640
Scott: Well, I mean, yeah, if you're talking about your unrealistic baseballs, you know More realistic baseballs you got to head to bases loaded or maybe Ken Griffey baseball on the Super Nintendo.

108
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:02,910
Rym: Of course, I mean Mario Tennis is perfectly realistic.

109
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,596
Scott: That's Mario Tennis is perfect.

110
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:05,860
Rym: That's exactly what tennis is.

111
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,647
Rym: I actually don't.

112
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:08,040
Scott: you know people love Virtua Tennis.

113
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Scott: I actually don't like Virtua Tennis even though I like Virtua Racing Virtua Tennis, I think the controls just have problems.

114
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:25,760
Rym: But the trouble is to this day if I want to play a good Mario sports game I tend to go back to the Mario Tennis on the game of cube Mario Tennis Because the newer one, but anyway, there is a new Mario sports game coming.

115
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,753
Rym: It was finally announced and there's some shadiness some trickiness.

116
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,438
Rym: I'm not looking forward to this.

117
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:31,940
Rym: I'm worried.

118
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:32,946
Scott: What are you worried about?

119
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:33,328
Rym: one?

120
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,340
Rym: It's not made by a Camelot.

121
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,560
Rym: Uh-oh And Camelot's done a good job of making the Mario games.

122
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,367
Rym: They added this kind of.

123
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:46,499
Rym: I don't want to say edginess But if you look at like the the animations the way the characters were in the games that Camelot made they were a little.

124
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:48,085
Scott: Who's making it?

125
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:49,650
Rym: You're never gonna guess.

126
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:54,750
Scott: All right, you're never gonna give me one guess square You know, it's Eidos slash.

127
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,100
Scott: No, it's it's Square Enix, right?

128
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,309
Scott: So they that's that makes sense because they made the.

129
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:13,374
Scott: there was the basketball one for the DS that had both Final Fantasy characters and Mario characters, so they're doing that and it's a Mario sports game called Mario sports Mix that has hockey basketball volleyball and dodgeball.

130
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:14,036
Scott: That could be good.

131
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,766
Scott: Volleyball games are usually great Dodge balls.

132
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:19,980
Rym: pretty great thing is when you and whenever you put multiple sports in the same game.

133
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,205
Rym: I'm leery that this is head.

134
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:26,787
Scott: Yeah, that is one thing right is that when you get a game like Mario tennis They put the full-on tennis right.

135
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:29,055
Scott: multiple courts multiple moves, right?

136
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:31,928
Scott: They make eat they make that game They put as much into it as they can.

137
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,040
Scott: when you get a multi pack, right?

138
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:40,236
Scott: They're not really gonna put in and make each individual sport as deep as it would be they could.

139
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,500
Rym: there's no reason they couldn't.

140
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,202
Rym: That's true.

141
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:42,825
Rym: They won't.

142
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:43,809
Rym: there is no way.

143
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:44,914
Rym: you'll tell me that they will.

144
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:45,677
Rym: there's no way.

145
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:49,689
Scott: if they did It would be amazing but odds of them doing it are very low.

146
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:53,480
Rym: and you know for player online play all that stuff.

147
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,084
Rym: There's a gameplay video.

148
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:56,388
Rym: I I don't know.

149
00:07:56,408 --> 00:08:00,860
Rym: Nintendo has been kind of turning its back on me more and more as time goes on.

150
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,053
Scott: I'm playing Mario Galaxy 2 right now and Kirby yarns pretty good.

151
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,479
Rym: Yeah, they're okay, but they're not.

152
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:05,840
Rym: I don't know.

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,119
Rym: They're not my go-to games anymore.

154
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,273
Rym: There was a long time when the Wii and the DS what I'm going to.

155
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:11,519
Scott: it's what I'm going to right now.

156
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:17,660
Scott: It's very moment But as soon as I beat those are single players as soon as I beat those bad boys the Wii is gonna take another nap.

157
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:22,980
Rym: Yeah, because these games are only great when you've got people physically in the room playing with you.

158
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:25,474
Rym: You gotta have four people and they all have to be good.

159
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:31,096
Rym: Yep Though we'll see what happens with Mario Sports Mix, but I I don't think I'm gonna buy it.

160
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:31,959
Rym: site on zine.

161
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:36,336
Scott: No, especially Nintendo still has this problem right where they put out a game.

162
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:37,380
Scott: It's 50 bucks.

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:45,817
Scott: All right, a lot of people play out of the game 50 bucks and then you know, for example Fallout New Vegas Which I was moderately considering but now I'm sort of not considering it anymore.

164
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:46,439
Scott: No matter how far.

165
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:47,746
Rym: Oh, I'm gonna buy it.

166
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,640
Rym: I'm 100% gonna buy it when it's a dollar.

167
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,007
Scott: Yeah, right the thing is Nintendo.

168
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:55,996
Scott: you wait like a year or two after the game comes out.

169
00:08:56,056 --> 00:08:56,698
Scott: still 50 40 bucks.

170
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,000
Scott: Right, maybe you'll be lucky and I got like a slight discount on galaxy tube from some Amazon.

171
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:14,039
Rym: This way if the GameCube Mario Tennis came out had never existed and it came out today On the Wii and it was the exact same game and you would you pay 40 bucks for it?

172
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:22,591
Scott: Uh If I tried it out and it was you know I guess the thing that made Mario Tennis so great though is because we had played.

173
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:29,038
Scott: we had recently played the Mario 64 Mario Tennis which was also like a paragon of game.

174
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:35,208
Scott: Of course We played the Mario 64 Mario Tennis and we had recently had amazing Experiences with it.

175
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:45,820
Scott: and shortly thereafter Right the Mario GameCube tennis appeared and that is why we jumped on it Because we had so recently played the high-quality Mario Tennis on the GameCube.

176
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:52,553
Scott: the thing is if the GameCube one had never come out that the N64 one would be like a distant memory.

177
00:09:52,694 --> 00:09:59,580
Scott: and because I'm not in a college Situation if the GameCube one came out now on the Wii I might not be so, you know all about it.

178
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,860
Scott: If I was still in college, you know, and I knew that there was gonna be tournaments and all sorts of activity.

179
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:20,480
Rym: Maybe well part of what did it was the Mario Tennis trash talk tournaments That's right, which which began on the n64 and migrated to the GameCube Which packs take heed a Mario Tennis trash talk tournament where you have to both win the trash talking and the tennis.

180
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,003
Scott: That's right.

181
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:22,831
Rym: You don't have a panel of expert judges.

182
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,339
Rym: get the pollen storm in the wheat and up there.

183
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,064
Rym: It's a pretty good action.

184
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:31,680
Scott: Oh tricky boot up at the ball right behind Luigi asshole to keep the Koopa covering boos and bots.

185
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:34,715
Scott: Okay, cuz boo can't get to the law.

186
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:37,945
Scott: I get all the love Deliver all the love.

187
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:44,415
Rym: I know that Scott boo not so great on his own Scott boo with Any boo on its own right.

188
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:45,400
Scott: if I'm on my own?

189
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,820
Scott: I'm not gonna pick the boo even though I probably will anyway.

190
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,280
Scott: But the read the problem with boo in Mario Tennis is that he is wicked tricky.

191
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,074
Scott: He has the hits that are like unbelievable.

192
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:57,319
Scott: You can hit it hard You know, he can't hit it the hardest but you can hit it real hard.

193
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:01,960
Scott: He can hit the the lob over your head the lob just over the net and all sorts of tricky hooks.

194
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:06,620
Scott: Put a ball out of your reach, but he's slow and his teleport isn't very slow.

195
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:13,330
Scott: So if you it's real easy to score on boo if he messes up at all Right, if he doesn't recenter after every hit.

196
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:20,902
Scott: you could totally get him so easily and he's no way He can make it all the way across the court where the kid the Koopa comes if he doesn't have the super shot Right.

197
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:27,040
Scott: So if you're playing on your own you're much better off picking a character like say the paratrooper who is you know?

198
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:29,651
Scott: Almost as tricky as the boo, but he has the speed.

199
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,580
Scott: this paratrooper can just go straight across the court.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,341
Rym: You know what?

201
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:36,395
Rym: straight up dude listeners the first two listeners who challenge us to a game.

202
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:40,749
Rym: if you're gonna be at PAX Boston Aka bitch pack or mag fest or mag fest.

203
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,320
Scott: We'll uh, we'll play you and no one's gonna beat us at Mario.

204
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:48,552
Rym: No one's gonna beat us at Mario I mean, who was the last group of people we played?

205
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:51,505
Rym: it was like Pete and Wyatt and they're pretty good But they're terrible.

206
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:52,790
Rym: They were pretty good.

207
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:55,139
Scott: Of course team Scott is the best.

208
00:11:55,681 --> 00:12:00,940
Rym: Yeah, because the problem is I don't have me and a Scott to play against team Scott.

209
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:03,227
Rym: It could be either Scott Scott Johnson's equally good.

210
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,090
Rym: Mm-hmm.

211
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,217
Rym: Anyway, it doesn't play the boo though.

212
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:07,260
Scott: No, he plays.

213
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:09,329
Scott: I think he plays the the Yoshi, right?

214
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:09,932
Scott: I don't remember what.

215
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:10,816
Scott: he really don't remember.

216
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:16,009
Scott: No Wow I'm gonna kid Koopa Anyway, or I think he's the shy guy sometimes too.

217
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,551
Scott: I don't remember.

218
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,200
Scott: No, I think he was the shy guy shy guy.

219
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,395
Scott: I'm pretty sure Pete is the shy guy shy guy.

220
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:26,747
Scott: That guy sucks All right, so In the news here, right?

221
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:33,669
Scott: So, you know, uh, Mame right the multiple arcade machine emulator That is like the the most number one emulator in the world.

222
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:39,844
Rym: that is important for as an aside the most stupid and horribly configured Program ever written.

223
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:41,309
Scott: Well, I mean, it's just it's.

224
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:50,100
Scott: it's a little tricky to use right because basically what they did is, you know For example any NES emulator only emulates the NES so it only has to worry about NES things.

225
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:55,618
Scott: Mame right emulates all these hundreds of different arcade machines.

226
00:12:55,638 --> 00:13:03,899
Rym: for example There's a mahjong game that has like 20 buttons on the front So you've got to make sure that it'll handle these individual buttons for this one game, right?

227
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,706
Scott: Exactly So what are you trying to emulate?

228
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:06,309
Rym: the soccer game?

229
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,960
Scott: You got the kicker instead of making multiple emulators?

230
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:17,767
Scott: They have this one program that selects the emulator based on the game you're playing right and then you know has this common Configuration as much as possible for.

231
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:25,079
Scott: but even if you make the configuration as you know condensed as possible There's still all these ancillary things all over the place, you know.

232
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:30,720
Scott: Like for example, you got to worry about six player x-men which means you need six coin slots, you know.

233
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,901
Scott: So it's like oh my god.

234
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:40,488
Rym: and and as a note the game was upside down because in the arcade it's displayed upside down So we had to turn it.

235
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,880
Scott: Yeah, it's all kinds of weird stuff anyway.

236
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:53,895
Scott: So Mame exists, right and there's actually a problem with Mame and I realized you know In the past day or two this problems actually bigger than I thought right.

237
00:13:53,935 --> 00:14:04,364
Scott: and basically what's going on with Mame Is it's an open-source project and there's people working on it But a lot of these people are not working on the parts that need to be worked on Like the interface of binding keys.

238
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:13,100
Scott: Well, no, no, no, they're working on things like, you know Re-architecting the code or you know filing bug reports, right?

239
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:20,111
Scott: But there aren't people who are doing things that really need to be done like on the emulation level like hey Let's get more games to work better, right?

240
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,760
Scott: People are working on the low levels.

241
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,580
Scott: There's almost none of them left like a very very small handful and that's a common problem with open-source projects.

242
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:35,560
Scott: And what tends to happen is there are people come in and they'll fix like one thing that they really care about and then leave You know, so they're having this trouble where they're basically Mame.

243
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:39,940
Scott: You know the important part to like add an almost standstill and this Mame developer.

244
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,920
Scott: He writes a whole big blog post here about it and there's all these comments, right?

245
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,083
Scott: And I was like all.

246
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:46,468
Scott: that's sad, but I can't help.

247
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,343
Scott: I mean emulator writing is not exactly my department You know, it's not.

248
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:51,548
Scott: that's not where I do.

249
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:55,000
Rym: also the long queue of already shat talked things.

250
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,265
Rym: We have to poop out.

251
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:56,988
Scott: I already did so.

252
00:14:57,028 --> 00:15:02,880
Rym: I've been not talking in a very long time working on stuff But as a result, we don't have time to commit to more things.

253
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,403
Scott: Yeah, I can't.

254
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,051
Scott: I can't start working on someone else's project.

255
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,921
Scott: One of my my projects not done yet Right.

256
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:11,620
Scott: So anyway, also one of our listeners right is has made a version of Mame.

257
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,872
Scott: I think it's a fork or a mod or I'm not sure exactly but it's basically.

258
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:18,665
Scott: it's a client server Mame and it allows you To play Mame over the internets.

259
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:22,398
Scott: so you can play six player x-men with six people in six different places.

260
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:22,960
Scott: That's pretty cool.

261
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:29,360
Scott: Anyway, so the other day for this show I need to emulate some Saturn games.

262
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,880
Scott: So yesterday last night, I was trying to emulate the Saturn and oh boy all the Saturn emulators are shit.

263
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:47,476
Scott: Yep, and I think basically what has happened here is I tried to do some examination right and it seems like what's happened was NES is emulated thoroughly right and there's a zillion NES emulators.

264
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:52,760
Scott: basically because people Copy, you know the one NES emulator that was out there.

265
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,807
Scott: It's like there's a lot of people.

266
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,542
Scott: they don't actually know how to write an emulator But they just copy the existing ones that are able to make all these emulators Really?

267
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:03,240
Scott: There's only a handful and it's the same one over and over again crooks lightly.

268
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:05,178
Rym: So yeah different levels of malware, right?

269
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:09,380
Scott: Yeah, but you know nestopia seems to be the winner and that's apart not nesticle.

270
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,160
Scott: You know the SNES has two emulators, of course the Super Famicom being the most, you know Number one console that anyone would want to emulate right?

271
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,000
Scott: So that's you know, the SNES 9x and ZSNES are pretty much the winners right and so on and so forth.

272
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:31,329
Scott: But as you go forward in the console, you know history, right the more obscure consoles turbo graphics, you know There are emulators, but they're not that great.

273
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,140
Scott: and 64 there are emulators, but they got problems.

274
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,100
Scott: You know, the PlayStation has EPS XE, which is a very good but PlayStation 2 very shitty.

275
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:46,100
Scott: We should be able to emulate the ps2 on the hardware We have now right and almost able to emulate the Xbox one.

276
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:56,492
Scott: But the emulators are just so bad and it seems like anyone who is capable of writing emulators Has no interest in doing so and is not putting any effort forth in doing so.

277
00:16:56,512 --> 00:17:04,316
Scott: and as a result there is like this dearth Basically old systems that are already emulated are gonna are safe and new systems are not.

278
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:08,010
Scott: and you know You think oh you just want a pirate ps2 game.

279
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,319
Rym: No, I want to play like the utenna game on the Saturn?

280
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,229
Scott: Well, no, but here's the real issue at stake here, right?

281
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:14,372
Scott: Is that okay?

282
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:18,396
Scott: I'm gonna go and buy legitimately buy a Sega Saturn ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

283
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,103
Scott: Yeah, okay.

284
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:25,020
Scott: There aren't enough of them to go around, you know for historical and preservation reasons, right?

285
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,279
Scott: We need good emulators of every system ever now, right?

286
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,240
Scott: It's absolute must and I if I was like, you know, there needs to be like a government grant.

287
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,200
Scott: Well, you realize what like library of Congress needs to give money to somebody at an edit college.

288
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,667
Scott: We're real computer scientists can make these emulators.

289
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:44,756
Rym: humans have been down this road before for a long time.

290
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:47,364
Rym: film movies TV shows.

291
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,447
Rym: we didn't keep them.

292
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:51,115
Rym: We're like who would want to see this TV show again.

293
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:53,163
Rym: We already showed it on TV Wasn't that what?

294
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:53,947
Scott: that's a no bro.

295
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,897
Scott: Is she girl talked about when we're at Otakon, right?

296
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:56,540
Rym: How many anime?

297
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:06,006
Scott: There's like look Disney has snow white right because keeping film right movie film in a real, you know All rolled up actually damn, you know damages it.

298
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:29,020
Scott: Disney has these underground pipes that are incredibly long and they have snow white on film Stretched out full length right in this pipe and many other films as well, you know to preserve them because it's important Right, but meanwhile you've got these animes like old animes just lost throwing away Degrading and he doesn't even want to stretch him out, you know in a tunnel.

299
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:36,246
Scott: He just wants to digitize them which is all you need to do and he's like it only caused this much to digitize a half Hour of anime, you know.

300
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,355
Scott: instead of giving money to this crap over here.

301
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:39,460
Scott: Maybe we should preserve this.

302
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,024
Rym: Well, it's the problem of any new art form I mean any new media.

303
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:50,620
Rym: but so many movies were lost just because people didn't care or by the time they cared It was too late or the medium was bad and they had no way to make a good copy.

304
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,205
Scott: Well, it's not too late, right?

305
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:57,360
Scott: Let's get some movement and preserve these old consoles and you know old.

306
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:01,499
Rym: Is there a movement already you can link to or are we trying to start the movement?

307
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:03,589
Scott: No Well, I mean there is sort of right there.

308
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:08,996
Scott: actually I forget what University is in California I think because gaming is actually new media like gaming.

309
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:09,358
Rym: There's.

310
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,385
Rym: It's like we invented movie.

311
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:17,550
Scott: There is a department at this university that is actually trying to preserve MMOs Which is why it's a research kind of thing.

312
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,380
Scott: They're like, how do we preserve this MMO?

313
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:28,572
Scott: It's like even if we save the copies of the server and client software and we emulate the machines It could run on so that we can run this software.

314
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:33,855
Scott: you go to the world and it's empty so it won't be anything like it was when the world was there.

315
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:41,631
Scott: and even if we have like a Recording of the world as it was of all the players and everything They played then, you know, you still wouldn't interact.

316
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:44,000
Scott: so you wouldn't be able to preserve the play experience.

317
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:48,760
Scott: It's lost forever like tribes - right we have the software but the play experience is lost forever, right?

318
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:55,200
Rym: Well, the people who cared about the game bought it, but they still haven't preserved the original play experience.

319
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,444
Scott: It is almost no one in there.

320
00:19:56,786 --> 00:19:57,809
Scott: You know, it's not.

321
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,559
Scott: you can't go and experience the way it was.

322
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:04,536
Scott: You know play the game as it was meant to be played as it was in the 90s.

323
00:20:04,597 --> 00:20:04,898
Scott: You can't.

324
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:12,340
Scott: that's gone It's lost probably forever and these people are researching how to preserve MMOs Right for all time, you know.

325
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,658
Scott: Because I guess you know, that's a my actually that's honestly a much more difficult problem than just preserving Saturn games.

326
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:27,280
Rym: in the very least however, PCS as long as the Documentation on how these old consoles are made is there and people have at least digitized the ROMs of the games.

327
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:29,847
Rym: Then they're not lost forever.

328
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:32,575
Rym: So long as someone can get access to that original spec.

329
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,902
Scott: Yeah, the thing is it's like we've got them Right.

330
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,900
Scott: I mean the ROMs are sort of out there and the emulators sort of exist.

331
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,867
Scott: But it's not it's still.

332
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:42,232
Scott: it needs to go all the way right?

333
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:43,677
Scott: Because you know, it could become.

334
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:44,903
Scott: you know It's.

335
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:46,694
Scott: it's a little bit shaky right now.

336
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:49,525
Scott: Well, this could be just like Situation.

337
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:50,451
Scott: we forgot how to make that.

338
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:51,700
Rym: look at the angry video game nerdy.

339
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:59,695
Rym: Well when he does the cinema ask her stuff and he talks about you know This old horror movie by whatever name is lost, but here's what we know about it.

340
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:01,763
Rym: Imagine it 40 years from now He's like.

341
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:05,399
Rym: there is this game called Zelda 2 and we've got it.

342
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:11,480
Rym: There was a game called Zelda 1 that came before but no one has a working copy of it to this day.

343
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,579
Rym: Yeah, imagine if that was the world.

344
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:21,720
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

345
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:27,760
Rym: I love it when the fat guy gets the ball and tries to run with it in football.

346
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:35,520
Scott: I think this is my theory of football popularity already I you know, there are many reasons that football is you know, and shut up soccer people, right?

347
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,140
Scott: Save that for another time that football is the most popular sport in the United States, right?

348
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,640
Scott: And I think there are many factors such as there are so few games that the importance of any one given game is incredibly high.

349
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:50,354
Rym: Efficiating is very good in the game is actually, you know, it's mostly.

350
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:51,077
Scott: it's mostly good.

351
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:55,654
Scott: It has issues though It's on network television as opposed to cable television.

352
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:57,259
Scott: so you can actually see every game.

353
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:06,820
Scott: Right, even if you don't pay for cable or you know have to you don't have to watch it like so frequently You know, there's discrete units of play and very recognizable strategy and tactics.

354
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:21,266
Scott: But I think the number one reason that football is the most popular sport in the United States is the fat guy gets the ball is because Right, unlike other sports on any given play and you know as the old saying goes any given Sunday Almost anything can happen.

355
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:25,160
Scott: right, you know, most plays are boring hand the ball off guy runs gets tackled.

356
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,091
Scott: Okay, but anything could have happened right?

357
00:22:28,191 --> 00:22:30,580
Scott: Oh, there's so many ludicrous things that could happen.

358
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,111
Scott: Whereas in baseball, you know, what could happen?

359
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:34,537
Scott: He could hit a home run.

360
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:35,260
Scott: He could steal home.

361
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,600
Scott: There aren't that many possibilities.

362
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:44,712
Scott: But in football just any game even the most boring game between two lame teams almost, you know There are very few games where nothing exciting happens ever.

363
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:49,439
Scott: go to NFL comm videos Click on highlights of any game and there are highlights for every game.

364
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:52,520
Scott: So basically them is gonna be really good for non football people.

365
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:59,240
Rym: But I will say this because we say this a lot if you don't think you're a sports person It's a very kind of stereotypical thing for nerds and gamers to be like.

366
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:08,110
Rym: I don't care about sports and anyone who hate you like sports is stupid and sports are bad for stupid people Aside from the fact that sports nerds are just as nerdy as you.

367
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,978
Rym: but about sports football is basically a game.

368
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:18,800
Scott: Yeah, I mean football, you know, if you really examined it from the right angle is perhaps the nerdiest of all sports.

369
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:22,396
Scott: You know, I guess not all sports cuz I mean banana grams is technically a sport.

370
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:26,995
Scott: also chess boxing yes, but but but is the nerdiest popular profession?

371
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:28,059
Scott: to explain what happened?

372
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:37,460
Rym: a Gigantic fat guy like one of the big fat not people that people down keep people from going past me guy a guy who was Never gonna touch the football in his career.

373
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:39,183
Rym: It's an accident.

374
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:40,687
Rym: Maybe bounces off of him.

375
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:42,693
Scott: I know most circumstances.

376
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:50,527
Scott: when this guy is playing because he's an offensive lineman He's not allowed to get the ball except under crazy circumstances like someone fumbles it and he picks it up So he gets the ball.

377
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:51,030
Rym: He's your.

378
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:53,065
Rym: he normally doesn't get it and You'll.

379
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:59,340
Rym: even if you've never seen a football game in your life It is obvious that he is not the kind of guy who's supposed to have the ball.

380
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:01,592
Rym: He runs in a way that guys like that.

381
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,180
Rym: it it's pretty great.

382
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:09,480
Scott: He just keeps going and all the other little guys can't knock him down Even if you don't care about the game situation or what it means, right?

383
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,966
Scott: Just the physicality of it.

384
00:24:11,027 --> 00:24:13,840
Scott: watching this guy run with the ball is an audience.

385
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:17,820
Rym: They can't even tackle him properly because he's got too much momentum.

386
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:23,320
Rym: Two guys have to jump and just push him forward simultaneously and hope he falls over.

387
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,434
Scott: I wish he would have made it to the end zone though.

388
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:25,977
Scott: That would have been.

389
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:28,839
Rym: He might not have been able to stop.

390
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:34,960
Scott: Yeah, so anyway interrelated to make it double football things of the day, right because football season is almost over here, right?

391
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,200
Scott: You know, even if you don't care about football.

392
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:49,160
Scott: This is a video of the top 10 memorable NFL coaching rants because you see in football after every game There's countless press conferences for both teams and the coaches come out and you know, they get questioned and they say stuff, right?

393
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:57,200
Scott: So, of course in many years of football some coaches have said many things that are funny or interesting or they got really mad.

394
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,677
Rym: All right I was familiar with made a little under half of these just because I don't watch a lot of sports.

395
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:05,700
Rym: compared to Scott Especially I never watched the pre or post anything ever.

396
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:08,929
Scott: Yeah, the pre or post things are usually just really bad.

397
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,860
Rym: but what to Scott's thing if you're even if you're not a sports person?

398
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:21,145
Rym: These are the kinds of like shared meme lines like when you're a gamer and you make some Starcraft joke about a zerg rush in an Unrelated situation.

399
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:23,880
Rym: sports people do the same thing with these, right?

400
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,723
Scott: So there's three.

401
00:25:24,743 --> 00:25:27,253
Scott: there's three of these that you really have to pay attention to right?

402
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:28,819
Scott: The first one is playoffs.

403
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:32,060
Scott: playoffs He's like, we're like if we win another game.

404
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:41,988
Scott: playoffs, right, so the other ones that are the most important right are You've got You play to win the game.

405
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:43,895
Scott: You don't play to just play it right.

406
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:45,360
Scott: you play to win the game.

407
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,317
Scott: So, you know, that's something that you can use right in your gaming.

408
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:57,519
Scott: nerdery Right is if some if you're like cheesing it up with your camping counter-strike and someone's like stop camping Just be like you play to win the game.

409
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,113
Scott: All right, and I we did it, you know, I fully agree with that 100%.

410
00:26:01,113 --> 00:26:07,806
Rym: Yeah game mechanics and mechanism design We've I mean we basically make the straight-up argument that if you're not playing to win a game You are griefing.

411
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:15,120
Scott: It's like if you're not playing a widget just get out Right, and then the third one, you know, it's it's the number one here, right?

412
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,743
Scott: You'll hear this.

413
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:24,020
Scott: there's people saying this a lot is they are who we thought they were And if that's not a catchphrase that you can apply to all parts of your life, I don't know what is.

414
00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:30,275
Rym: So very briefly the meta moment the GeekNights book club book is Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

415
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:43,118
Rym: the next live event We will be doing is MAGFest Four days of non-stop games and concerts at the Hilton Alexandria in Virginia and if you're in New York City when we're at mag fest you can go to recess.

416
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:51,685
Rym: nerd two days of RPGs and tabletop games but January 13th through 16th That is the weekend at mag fest.

417
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:54,092
Rym: We will be doing three panels.

418
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:54,654
Scott: Oh shit.

419
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:55,838
Rym: One is our panel.

420
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:56,520
Rym: It's an old one.

421
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,104
Rym: I'm revamped a little bit.

422
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:00,070
Rym: losing should be fun.

423
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:02,737
Rym: Alrighty, and we're also part of the mag nine.

424
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,907
Rym: nine gaming intellectuals We're gonna sit out with.

425
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:07,040
Scott: I'm an intellectual now with other experts.

426
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:08,547
Scott: I'm playing computer science degree.

427
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:11,340
Rym: two of the panels that this group is putting on will just be panelists.

428
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,260
Rym: So it's not like us doing a lecture.

429
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:21,785
Rym: It's all sitting there with other people with whom we may disagree publicly and possibly angrily because there John St.

430
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,456
Scott: John's also gonna be there and so is James Rolfe.

431
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:26,392
Scott: James Rolfe It's gonna be a nerd fest.

432
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:32,980
Rym: But we're gonna be on technical changes in game design and we're gonna be on achievements and metagaming.

433
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:33,589
Scott: You know what?

434
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,280
Scott: We got to say about that.

435
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,426
Rym: I hope somebody's like man.

436
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,940
Rym: team fortress 2 is so much more fun after they added hats.

437
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:45,360
Rym: Yeah, gonna bring up dad's waiting for that race at the roof on fire at clown pistols all a whole bandolier of clown pistols.

438
00:27:45,782 --> 00:27:47,468
Scott: Oh shit, we need some of those.

439
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:48,974
Scott: Can we get those in Virginia?

440
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:50,340
Rym: I have no idea.

441
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:52,900
Rym: Anyway, we're also gonna be a paxies and all that stuff.

442
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:53,707
Rym: But it's down the road.

443
00:27:53,808 --> 00:27:58,226
Rym: mag fest is what you got to care about right now And we're almost out of gig night's t-shirts.

444
00:27:58,346 --> 00:28:00,109
Rym: So once they sell out we're gonna order more.

445
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:08,370
Rym: and So in 1983 the game was made we're one year old about a guy who drops bombs.

446
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:12,188
Rym: dude That was pretty much it.

447
00:28:12,652 --> 00:28:15,549
Rym: Bomberman was a single-player game where you drop bombs.

448
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:19,928
Scott: Well, I mean it wasn't just that you drop bombs right cuz in kaboom you catch bombs.

449
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:23,560
Rym: Yeah But spiritual successor one might say.

450
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,057
Scott: well in terms of games with the theme of bowling ball candle Right, but I mean the first.

451
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:34,289
Scott: the thing about barman is you drop a bomb and it blows up into four directions because the square Grid, right?

452
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:39,633
Scott: But what you have to do is you have to drop the bomb and then you have to hide because your own bomb Hurts you.

453
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:43,666
Scott: and actually I think that's the one that is the of all the different things in Bomberman.

454
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:52,169
Scott: cuz everything is like 70 plus Bomberman games and they all have incredible amounts of differences and modes and power-ups and items and all.

455
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,324
Scott: there's so so much variation.

456
00:28:54,364 --> 00:29:03,780
Scott: but the Fundamental thing that makes Bomberman Bomberman is that your weapon of attack is is the dangerous bomb That can also hurt you.

457
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,917
Rym: It is not always the dangerous bomb It is a dangerous bomb.

458
00:29:06,957 --> 00:29:09,090
Rym: that could in fact be a dangerous bomb.

459
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,109
Scott: Yeah, right, but I mean, you know what other in what other video game right like it?

460
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:20,270
Scott: You know until they came out with games like say quake where you could hurt yourself with your own grenades, right?

461
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:27,733
Scott: But even then while you can hurt yourself with your own grenades or rockets that isn't like the fundamental gameplay mechanic Right.

462
00:29:27,773 --> 00:29:29,425
Scott: That's just an aspect of the game.

463
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:34,370
Scott: most of the time You're probably using some other gun anyway, and or you're shooting a rocket far away from you.

464
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,880
Rym: Well, that does get to the point with the simple mechanic.

465
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:46,089
Rym: I think the reason Bomberman is so Loved so ported so remade forever and continuously is because they're milking it for money in Japan big time.

466
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,790
Rym: one One was released on the Xbox like just a little while ago.

467
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,401
Scott: It was actually the second one that was released on the Xbox.

468
00:29:52,763 --> 00:30:03,908
Rym: is that it's one of those rare Simple kind of discreet easily understood easy to learn difficult to master direct fucking versus multiplayer games?

469
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:05,338
Scott: Yeah, I think that's the one thing.

470
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:12,250
Scott: is it started out as a single-player game But I think was it in Bomberman 2 or was it in Super Bomberman where they first added the multiplayer aspect?

471
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:19,770
Scott: I'm not sure where the first place that I experienced the multiplayer was in the Super Bomberman Right with a two-player versus on the Super Nintendo.

472
00:30:20,313 --> 00:30:23,110
Rym: For me was I remember the turbo graphics is where I was playing it.

473
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,690
Scott: The turbo graphics is a very popular version of our man.

474
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,095
Rym: That's oddly enough.

475
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:29,319
Rym: when I was working that might have

476
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:30,643
Scott: been Bomberman 93

477
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:41,208
Rym: when I was working at IBM one of my co-workers I went out to dinner with like him and his wife and everything and the wife went away and then he was like I got Something and he whips out his old turbo graphics and we played some Bomberman.

478
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:41,690
Scott: Oh, yeah.

479
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:45,970
Scott: But yeah, the thing with Bomberman is that they mean the very first video games.

480
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:50,490
Scott: I mean, I guess space war wasn't but pong was a direct versus game.

481
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:55,710
Scott: You know my paddle versus your pad warlords right warlords is the direct versus game.

482
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,107
Scott: So the Bomberman is by no means the first direct versus game.

483
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:04,970
Scott: nor did it rep You know, but what it is is it's sort of when it comes to many players, right?

484
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,442
Scott: I mean warlords had four but Bomberman can be a zillion right.

485
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:17,037
Scott: and when it comes to like direct Fighting you like ultra direct, you know, I mean there were games, you know If you think about it back in those days.

486
00:31:17,098 --> 00:31:23,169
Scott: in terms of ultra direct versus video games I mean you had your sports games and you're fighting games, you know.

487
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:28,449
Scott: And sometimes you had a turn-based strategy game or maybe the real-time one later on.

488
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:34,729
Scott: But in terms of direct gaming Mike every other game and every other genre was not direct versus.

489
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,348
Scott: you know If you know pong is a sports game, right?

490
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:40,729
Scott: Racing games or sports games most games were.

491
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:44,824
Rym: you know You play them someone else plays you compare the score as in Mario, right?

492
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,570
Scott: or there were co-op games, right?

493
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,210
Scott: Which is contra which disappeared and came back River City Ransom, right?

494
00:31:50,650 --> 00:32:00,920
Scott: So in those days if it wasn't a sports game and it wasn't a fighting game It wasn't a direct versus game unless it was Bomberman, you know and even Tetris is sort of an indirect versus.

495
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:08,561
Rym: in a way Bomberman is proof of something else because these These sorts of direct games definitely resonate with people who are gamers because they're.

496
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:12,529
Rym: they're very much more like what we call sports.

497
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:20,810
Rym: Four people playing Bomberman has the same feeling as four people playing dodgeball or four people playing, you know any sport?

498
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,384
Scott: Yeah, I mean there was super dodgeball, but that's a sports game.

499
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:28,021
Rym: That's a great game But only two player true and you know their remakes recently.

500
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,125
Rym: that kind of crappy.

501
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:30,750
Rym: I think that dodgeball franchise is dead.

502
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:37,833
Rym: But part of is the Bomberman is so simple and yet as simple as it is The like.

503
00:32:37,853 --> 00:32:40,001
Rym: the skill cap is surprisingly high.

504
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:42,510
Rym: You can be very very good at Bomberman.

505
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,331
Scott: Well, I think part of the help the reason that the skill cap is so high is because there's just so much variation Right.

506
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:48,235
Scott: It's like Tetris.

507
00:32:48,275 --> 00:33:00,750
Scott: they keep bringing up variants of it Bomberman They can you know, there are many variants of our men all over the place But they can really milk that fundamental game with only slight changes very very far, right?

508
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,940
Scott: They come up with new power-ups new maps.

509
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,050
Scott: maps have gimmicks, right?

510
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,570
Scott: You know, they can bring power-ups that do their down power-ups.

511
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,370
Scott: They can get viruses and then they can think of all these different viruses for you to get right?

512
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:18,329
Scott: They can just keep going and keep going without changing the fundamental rules of the game much like Pac Man.

513
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:24,209
Scott: CE DX doesn't really change the fundamental rules of Pac Man other than adding bombs, right?

514
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:36,481
Scott: Bomberman you can mix it up so much without changing the fundamental rule set so that anyone who's played any Bomberman Ever can pick up one and play and what surprises me the most is when we go to play a Bomberman because it's the ultimate party game.

515
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:40,490
Scott: almost Every time there will be every time there's like what's Bomberman?

516
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,699
Scott: I don't know how to play and I'm like what the hell.

517
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,210
Rym: now they watch you play and they're really confused.

518
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:54,970
Rym: But if you just put a controller in anyone's hands and you're like, press a to drop a bomb Yeah and use the stick to move they'll figure it out and reveal fast and then they'll have a lot of fun.

519
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,250
Scott: Yeah, they'll have a lot of fun after 20 minutes of blowing themselves up.

520
00:33:58,491 --> 00:33:58,853
Rym: It's also.

521
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:06,043
Rym: it's a game that is it does the right balance of you know Because the bombs hurt you you can't just try to kill the other players.

522
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,330
Rym: The best strategy is to let them kill themselves.

523
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:11,803
Scott: Yeah, it's like unless they're good in other direct versus games, right?

524
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:13,489
Scott: You know, it's always like a fighting game.

525
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:19,842
Scott: It's always about the attack and the defense and some people might go all out attack Some people might do defense and attack at the opportunity.

526
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:21,250
Rym: There's really no defense Bomberman.

527
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,900
Scott: There's really no defense except for the shield mode, right?

528
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:30,889
Rym: So in the DS version, yeah, or like the barrier Yeah, maybe you play the like the bomb to prevent someone from running around there.

529
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:35,630
Scott: There isn't much defense and you can't just sit still because you need to get the power-ups.

530
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,016
Scott: You have to bomb right.

531
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:41,237
Scott: if you just sit still and wait for someone to come to you It's not gonna work out too well, right?

532
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,210
Scott: It's as you're either gonna get killed at best double suicide.

533
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,090
Scott: Do you have to go yet right away?

534
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:50,648
Scott: You have to get power-ups and then before you know it you're in with someone else and someone's good.

535
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:53,922
Scott: You got someone's gonna die from bombs.

536
00:34:53,943 --> 00:34:55,530
Rym: I love watching all the different play styles.

537
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:08,150
Rym: Like I tend to either Be very particular like I'll drop bombs at intervals and I'll try to box people in or I'll leave bombs at a bunch of different Places as I'm running and kind of random intervals so that they don't set each other off.

538
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,630
Rym: So they're blowing up like boom boom boom boom boom all over the place.

539
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:20,870
Rym: I'm trying to confuse my opponents But a lot of other people unnamed front row crew people will basically just run next to you hitting a as fast as they can.

540
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:24,350
Scott: That is not a good idea in a game where your weapon is a bomb.

541
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:28,535
Scott: If your weapon was say a kicking foot or a punching fist That is a great idea.

542
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:34,630
Scott: Kendra Rose got that down when your weapon is a bomb Running right up next to the enemy and dropping the bomb.

543
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,550
Scott: I mean think about when you want to play a bar man.

544
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:40,070
Scott: If you want to get skilled at it think of the bomb as a grenade that you can't throw.

545
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,909
Scott: So you basically pull the pin unless you get the power glove a true.

546
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:45,430
Scott: But basically you pull the pin and drop it on the ground, right?

547
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,350
Scott: If you're gonna fight someone with grenades, would you run up to them pull the pin and drop it on the ground?

548
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:52,465
Scott: Hell no, that's the last thing you would want to do.

549
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,449
Rym: sometimes it works.

550
00:35:57,471 --> 00:35:58,935
Rym: What in your opinion?

551
00:35:59,236 --> 00:36:00,500
Rym: we're debating this a lot.

552
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,550
Rym: we're trying out different versions because there's so many bomber meds.

553
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:05,356
Rym: What is the best bomber man?

554
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:08,510
Rym: because the newest one which I just bought so we can Scott plays?

555
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,954
Scott: Yeah battle fest for the 360.

556
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:13,184
Scott: Yeah bomber man live battle fest is not the greatest.

557
00:36:13,224 --> 00:36:15,110
Rym: It's at best a mediocre offering.

558
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:17,310
Rym: I'm actually extremely disappointed in this game.

559
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,870
Rym: I only bought it because I don't have any other bomber man.

560
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,486
Rym: It's just the style is kind of tacked on the game is kind of slow.

561
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:25,790
Rym: It's got a couple of problems.

562
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:27,318
Rym: It's not that configurable.

563
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:29,510
Rym: It's just yeah, they're putting in the minimum effort.

564
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,158
Rym: They're like, yeah, we made another bomber man.

565
00:36:31,218 --> 00:36:32,223
Rym: People are gonna buy it.

566
00:36:32,464 --> 00:36:33,570
Rym: They're not trying anymore.

567
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:39,630
Scott: Yeah The biggest problem here is that there's like 70 plus bomber man games and a lot of them weren't released in the u.s.

568
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,256
Scott: Did you know there were super bomber man?

569
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:44,529
Scott: One, two, three, four five three was only released in Japan.

570
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,395
Scott: in Europe Four and five were Japan only.

571
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:50,087
Rym: Yeah, you think people get the hell jerks with the Final Fantasy situation.

572
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,090
Rym: That's got nothing on this.

573
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,793
Scott: Yeah, we didn't.

574
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:52,878
Scott: even it's Final Fantasy.

575
00:36:52,898 --> 00:36:55,650
Scott: We got the games with different numbers here, right?

576
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,570
Scott: We don't even get the damn games, you know.

577
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,770
Scott: They were like online bomber men that were only available in Japan and Korea apparently in Europe.

578
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:03,683
Scott: How come I didn't get to play the online bomber man?

579
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:04,770
Scott: What the fuck in Europe?

580
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,957
Rym: The ZX spectrum version was not called bomber man.

581
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:09,285
Rym: It was called Eric and the floaters.

582
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:10,590
Scott: What the fuck?

583
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:13,603
Scott: I mean, we're learning all this from Wikipedia, by the way, or don't?

584
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:16,940
Rym: Pepe in Los Globos There was also.

585
00:37:17,243 --> 00:37:25,454
Scott: there's also a thing I only recently found out about while I was researching for the show called bomber man be demand and Bomberman be demand isn't?

586
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:29,286
Scott: is more like that Bakugan with the spinning tops only you shoot marbles.

587
00:37:29,306 --> 00:37:30,630
Scott: It's like marble shooting toys.

588
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:34,909
Scott: I don't know how they're related to bomber man, but they are somehow I don't get it.

589
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,081
Rym: One of the early bomber man games was first-person.

590
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:37,906
Scott: what?

591
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:47,370
Scott: yeah I mean there were some 3d ones for The n64 and such and the GameCube that were 3d bomber man in 1984.

592
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,298
Rym: Whoa was first person?

593
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:50,282
Rym: what the crap?

594
00:37:50,383 --> 00:37:52,070
Scott: Yeah, how would you even know where the bomb?

595
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,606
Scott: I mean you turn around a corner you turn right to look for it to scan to see.

596
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:56,310
Scott: is there a bomb there?

597
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,656
Rym: Well, that was on the MSX.

598
00:37:57,897 --> 00:37:58,902
Rym: I mean, okay.

599
00:37:59,163 --> 00:38:00,570
Scott: It's like you're gonna get bombed.

600
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:01,413
Rym: I would like to see.

601
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:07,041
Rym: you know, if you remade bomber man in unity, you basically could be like, alright, it's topped out Alright, it's FPS instead.

602
00:38:07,423 --> 00:38:20,928
Scott: Yeah anyway But yeah, so I mean if I had to pick the best bomber man I mean the best bar man that I personally have played and have had the most fun with I think Honestly is the GameCube one which I believe is bomber man evolutions

603
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:21,330
Rym: the one

604
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:26,046
Scott: Because we played that GameCube one down at the shore and we fresh the one that has gold bomber.

605
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:29,518
Scott: Yeah, right Yeah, that's that one.

606
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:30,584
Scott: So that is actually.

607
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:36,610
Rym: that is a pretty good one I would put at the top of the ones I've played regularly the DS one because it's so quick to get an awesome game.

608
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:40,208
Scott: Yes, one it has advantage over it because a it's portable, right?

609
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,330
Scott: Be you can get eight people at once instead of just for my god, right?

610
00:38:45,171 --> 00:38:51,154
Scott: But the DS one I mean it has some good modes that you won't find anywhere else, but it also has some modes I really don't care.

611
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:51,757
Rym: Here's the trouble.

612
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:54,430
Rym: It has better modes than the current one on the Xbox.

613
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:59,950
Scott: That's true because the like the Xbox has a mode that sounds at first to be the greatest mode just team crown.

614
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:06,447
Scott: But DS one has get the crown which is much better which isn't far superior mode, right?

615
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:13,750
Scott: So But yeah, the GameCube one still has you know, really good modes and stuff and it's you know It's a pretty much all-around bar, man.

616
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:20,558
Rym: But the thing is if you see people at conventions like out in the wild like when we used to go to uber-con every year They'd be playing this in the lobby.

617
00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:21,080
Rym: Mmm.

618
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:24,072
Rym: It's always the Sega Saturn Is it?

619
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:27,103
Scott: yeah, I don't know but I mean basically my Reese.

620
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:29,190
Scott: I haven't played the Sega Saturn one until yesterday.

621
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,674
Scott: Let's I was talking about emulating it.

622
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:53,130
Scott: But yeah, apparently one of the most heralded Bomberman games is the Sega Saturn version which can support 10 player verse Right and just watch a video of the multi the 10 player verse multiplayer in Sega Saturn Bomberman and you will know immediately if you know anything about Bomberman that that is a damn good power.

623
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:55,869
Rym: Now this is my trouble with Bomberman live battle fest.

624
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,415
Rym: one The maps are all way too small.

625
00:39:57,877 --> 00:40:01,290
Rym: and two, they're all tilted 3d like way tilted.

626
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:01,792
Rym: I want to.

627
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:03,158
Rym: just I want a top-down view.

628
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,308
Rym: not every game needs to be like super.

629
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:05,790
Rym: check it out.

630
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,372
Rym: We're two and a half D. It only hurts the game It does not.

631
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:16,350
Scott: I mean the thing is even if you make your game two and a half D Right, you can still put your camera directly on the side or just give me the I changing it.

632
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,490
Rym: But they don't because they don't care because people buy it anyway.

633
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:29,357
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's like they don't need to put that much effort into making a party game You know to cover all these bases as they do have to put into effort to make say You know an FPS that is meant for a competition.

634
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:30,682
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is RTS.

635
00:40:30,902 --> 00:40:33,230
Rym: who's competing with Bomberman Bomberman?

636
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:38,054
Scott: Yeah, all the 70 other Bomberman games are competing with every new Bomberman game And I think that's like.

637
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:39,901
Scott: should you buy the new Bomberman battle fest?

638
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,010
Scott: You can still buy the previous Xbox Bomberman.

639
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:42,834
Scott: It's still up there.

640
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:45,546
Scott: You could buy you know Bomberman for your Wii instead.

641
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:46,330
Scott: I think that's a better one.

642
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:53,630
Rym: That we don't have is the pac-man championship edition DX equivalent for Bomberman, that's absolutely.

643
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,564
Scott: I think whoever worked on pac-man ced-x needs to go and I know it's.

644
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:58,949
Scott: I think it's a different company, right?

645
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:00,975
Scott: That's Hudson.

646
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:04,070
Scott: But yeah, but they need to go over and wearing pie studio.

647
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,695
Scott: Maybe Namco's one.

648
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:09,306
Scott: Namco should buy Hudson and make Bomberman awesome.

649
00:41:09,326 --> 00:41:10,790
Scott: the way they've made pac-man awesome.

650
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:12,642
Scott: Oh shit what I get all over that.

651
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:17,777
Rym: It was pie they're making.

652
00:41:17,857 --> 00:41:19,422
Rym: they made the new Bomberman battle fest.

653
00:41:19,964 --> 00:41:24,077
Rym: they never made any other Bomberman Mmm, so they're probably probably.

654
00:41:24,097 --> 00:41:28,650
Rym: I don't know why but they basically just made a kind of crummy port of the previous game by whoever.

655
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,939
Scott: Yeah Yeah, there's actually there's a Wii Bomberman.

656
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:32,381
Scott: That's not.

657
00:41:32,401 --> 00:41:36,841
Scott: I think battle fest is actually also on the Wii But there's actually a previous WiiWare Bomberman.

658
00:41:36,881 --> 00:41:37,525
Scott: that's on the Wii.

659
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:39,997
Scott: That's not a bad one You know, it's not as good as the game.

660
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:42,670
Rym: I think you can get the turbo graphics one on the virtual.

661
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,717
Scott: Oh, yeah, you can do that too.

662
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:50,387
Rym: You can get the turbo graphics, but I was not that good though I mean it was five player which is a big deal, but there's not that much going on for it.

663
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:54,990
Scott: Yeah Yeah, this you know Bomberman multiplayer is really where the action is.

664
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,890
Scott: The thing is there is single-player Bomberman, you know pretty much almost most of the Bomberman releases have single-player.

665
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:06,230
Scott: In fact the original one there was single-player only and basically it was these bad guys going around the map.

666
00:42:06,351 --> 00:42:09,410
Scott: You had to bomb them without bombing yourself and you had to find the exit.

667
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:12,369
Scott: But if you bomb the exit bad guy got angry and bad guys came out.

668
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:14,870
Scott: Then you had to kill them and then get me exit bad guys.

669
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,556
Rym: I was like those little balloons or the.

670
00:42:16,596 --> 00:42:20,572
Scott: yeah, actually pretty challenging to play single-player Bomberman It's.

671
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:23,161
Scott: it's not an easy game and it is a good game.

672
00:42:23,884 --> 00:42:24,928
Scott: But you know, it's not multiplayer.

673
00:42:24,948 --> 00:42:30,063
Scott: around me there's also What's it called the huh?

674
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:32,492
Scott: Trouble.

675
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:37,156
Scott: yeah, I forget you forget you got nothing Had it.

676
00:42:37,216 --> 00:42:39,827
Rym: what a game a Bomberman game.

677
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:44,162
Scott: Oh, yeah Yeah, there's the Bomberman games that are that are sort of like, you know, they're.

678
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:46,470
Scott: they're not like the other Bomberman games, right?

679
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:53,990
Scott: It's like there's the 3d one on the 64 and there's also a 3d one of the GameCube where it's like Third-person shooter almost where Bomberman.

680
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:59,669
Rym: Yeah, you don't have to say remember mega the Mega Man game where you fight a fire in 3d Mega Man Legends.

681
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:01,496
Scott: Yeah That's basically it's the.

682
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:03,243
Scott: it's the Mega Man Legends of Bomberman.

683
00:43:03,283 --> 00:43:05,170
Rym: I played Mega Man Legends by accident.

684
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,815
Scott: Yeah, cuz I modded.

685
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:08,984
Rym: my thing is one to play here and I had to.

686
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,068
Rym: I needed a game to test.

687
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:10,430
Scott: so weird.

688
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,524
Scott: I always had the idea that Mega Man's Legends was hated.

689
00:43:12,544 --> 00:43:13,390
Scott: good and I hated it too.

690
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:18,110
Scott: And then Mega Man Legends 3 was announced more recently and suddenly all those people came out of the woodwork.

691
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,515
Scott: They're like, yeah Mega Man Legends.

692
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,983
Scott: I'm like what terrible like who liked it.

693
00:43:22,544 --> 00:43:23,227
Scott: It's like you like it.

694
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,130
Scott: now suddenly what?

695
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,896
Rym: Maybe they always liked it.

696
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,065
Scott: I I don't get it.

697
00:43:27,186 --> 00:43:27,589
Scott: I don't get it.

698
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,621
Scott: Yeah, there's you know, this puzzle the bar read be demand and all these.

699
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:34,135
Scott: there's all these Bomberman games that are not Straight-up Bomberman.

700
00:43:34,336 --> 00:43:37,630
Scott: I cannot accept, you know, just you know get about because what I want is the.

701
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,892
Rym: It's like.

702
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:40,270
Scott: it's like the x-com third-person shooter, right?

703
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,254
Scott: It's like who wants that?

704
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,890
Rym: because I mean, you know, we just had it's like a sport and everything.

705
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,822
Rym: But this is proof if why couldn't rampart have had the same fruit.

706
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:50,610
Rym: Why aren't there like 30 rampart games over the last decades?

707
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:51,331
Rym: Mm-hmm.

708
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:54,185
Rym: I mean it could have been the exact same thing just incremental improvement art.

709
00:43:54,225 --> 00:43:54,988
Rym: another rampart.

710
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:59,250
Scott: We got eight cats like I don't you know, I mean there's a point where too much is too much, right?

711
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,490
Scott: I mean you can remake something too many times and then it's like okay stop remaking it.

712
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,110
Scott: But I do think a game that is a perennial, you know thing like that needs to be remade.

713
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:10,070
Scott: There should be a Tetris on every platform, right?

714
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:16,820
Scott: There should be a Bomberman on every platform and when you bring it to a new platform You have to make it better than it was previous, but you don't have.

715
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,594
Scott: I'm not asking for a pac-man CEX revolution Although I am.

716
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:24,209
Scott: I would mind that it just needs to be the best Bomberman.

717
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:25,477
Scott: yet It doesn't need to be.

718
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,712
Rym: they're almost like seasons of Bomberman Like.

719
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:30,223
Rym: this is the season of Bomberman and everyone gets good at it.

720
00:44:30,263 --> 00:44:31,810
Rym: Then the next season they change the rules.

721
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:32,875
Rym: It's different Bomberman.

722
00:44:33,056 --> 00:44:33,478
Scott: Yeah, right.

723
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:37,314
Scott: So like how the mahjong card is different every year for the Jewish ladies You know, there's some.

724
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:41,369
Rym: there's a model with the direct versus games like Bomberman or if you remade rampart?

725
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:43,149
Rym: What if instead of buying the game?

726
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:52,750
Rym: it was a pac-man DX situation where you bought a subscription and Every three years the official new version for all the tournaments for that three years span came out.

727
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:56,345
Scott: I don't think the thing is there's not exactly a hot tournament circuit for Bomberman.

728
00:44:56,486 --> 00:45:02,410
Rym: You could make it I. There is a hot like mid-level convention circuit of Bomberman.

729
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:04,916
Rym: You go to any gaming con.

730
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:06,141
Rym: There's a Bomberman tournament.

731
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,770
Rym: You're gonna win like a hundred dollar gift certificate.

732
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:12,325
Scott: Yeah, Bomberman would make a great omega-thon final round.

733
00:45:12,345 --> 00:45:16,216
Rym: Oh Man, oh, yeah or rampart.

734
00:45:16,778 --> 00:45:17,740
Rym: I have a three-way.

735
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,032
Scott: Anyway, there's also You know the Bomberman the single-player games.

736
00:45:23,073 --> 00:45:24,319
Scott: there are plots in them.

737
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:29,900
Scott: In fact, some of the games including the Saturn one have like an anime intro and lots of animated videos in them.

738
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:31,550
Rym: Oh, look a bowling ball candle.

739
00:45:31,832 --> 00:45:33,059
Rym: Yeah, but this is my power.

740
00:45:33,441 --> 00:45:35,286
Scott: The plot really is like it's.

741
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,154
Scott: so it just completely mixes up between games.

742
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,300
Scott: It really there's no continuity to it.

743
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:47,699
Scott: It's not like Sonic Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario where you can actually sort of like be like, okay This is the store Zelda where you can be like, okay, this is the story, right?

744
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,045
Scott: Even though even those stories are kind of choppy.

745
00:45:50,466 --> 00:45:59,780
Scott: This story is basically non-existent, you know, Mega Man has the story Bomberman has It's just you know Colors on each different game that are slightly different.

746
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:03,187
Scott: There's also I don't know people remember this right?

747
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:07,260
Scott: There's two Bomberman games that actually I played mostly before my college days.

748
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:18,670
Scott: There's Bomberman GB, which is a Game Boy Bomberman for the original Game Boy But it actually came out late in the Game Boy's life like right before the Game Boy Color appeared and it actually has this Indiana Jones theme to it.

749
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,880
Scott: I don't know if it has any multiplayer.

750
00:46:20,825 --> 00:46:21,799
Scott: If it did I never played it.

751
00:46:22,101 --> 00:46:26,557
Scott: But as Indiana Jones theme and it's actually a pretty good Bomberman that I think is sort of lost and forgotten.

752
00:46:26,577 --> 00:46:28,244
Scott: the way Wario 2 Is lost and forgotten.

753
00:46:28,264 --> 00:46:31,760
Scott: it actually came around out around the same time as Wario 2 if I remember.

754
00:46:32,282 --> 00:46:33,226
Rym: That was a good game.

755
00:46:33,306 --> 00:46:38,546
Scott: It was also this PC version of Bomberman that I bought Called Atomic Bomberman.

756
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:42,840
Rym: and the thing with Atomic Bomberman is I remember we all bought it and tried to make the multiplayer.

757
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,454
Rym: Yeah, I found it in the discount bin.

758
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:48,570
Rym: So I bought a couple more CDs Yeah, and then we never got it to work.

759
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:49,996
Scott: you use IPX networking only.

760
00:46:50,197 --> 00:46:52,245
Scott: Yeah But what it is?

761
00:46:52,285 --> 00:46:56,520
Rym: no, no, no, remember that was when we were accused by the neighbors of hacking.

762
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:58,146
Scott: No, that was because I was using.

763
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:00,213
Rym: it was also cuz I have likes on half-life.

764
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:01,960
Rym: We'd set up IPX for a bunch of stuff.

765
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,446
Scott: Yeah, man IPX and their firewall went.

766
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:06,270
Rym: oh my god, that's a blast from the flask.

767
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:06,671
Scott: Yeah.

768
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,774
Scott: Anyway zone alarm.

769
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:08,255
Scott: Yeah.

770
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:08,916
Scott: Yeah.

771
00:47:09,157 --> 00:47:12,044
Scott: Anyway the Was I saying right.

772
00:47:12,064 --> 00:47:15,820
Scott: so Atomic Bomberman is a weird Bomberman that I think no one remembers really.

773
00:47:16,162 --> 00:47:18,300
Scott: But the thing about it was it was a PC game.

774
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:27,890
Scott: The the guys were shaped like Bomberman, you know with space helmets and whatever, but they were not styled like cute Happy Bomberman, right, you know Bomberman is like white bomber.

775
00:47:28,593 --> 00:47:29,295
Scott: I think in Japan.

776
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:36,536
Scott: I found out his name is Shiro ban right and Basically, he's like the cheerful hero right and that describes Bomberman exactly, right?

777
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:37,319
Scott: He's like yay bombs.

778
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,450
Scott: All right, that's Bomberman, but this it was like dark.

779
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:42,420
Scott: It was like yeah bombs atomic bombs.

780
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,197
Scott: Yeah, it was you know, it was dark Bomberman, but it wasn't completely dark.

781
00:47:46,257 --> 00:47:46,860
Scott: It was just dark.

782
00:47:48,581 --> 00:48:02,128
Scott: And but the thing about a Tom Barman despite its darkness and despite its sort of pixel ish DOS early Windows game kind of graphics It actually had an insane number of game modes and maps and Customizability because it was a PC game.

783
00:48:02,148 --> 00:48:03,191
Scott: You can get your hands on it.

784
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:06,020
Scott: Unlike, you know other Bomberman games.

785
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:08,004
Scott: They're just console You can't do anything to them.

786
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:16,071
Scott: and the result of that was that it had ridiculous modes and the one mode I remember that was the most popular I've never seen in any other Bomberman ever is Wally bomb mode.

787
00:48:16,513 --> 00:48:30,513
Scott: and Wally bomb mode is basically there's an impenetrable wall down the middle of the map and there's two teams one on the left and one on the right and Everyone has the gloves so everyone can throw bombs to the other side And that's Wally bomb mode.

788
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:31,340
Rym: That's pretty good.

789
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,680
Scott: I've never seen that mode in any other game except the Tom apartment.

790
00:48:34,760 --> 00:49:03,980
Scott: so really what I would really like more than anything is I think the perfect Bomberman would be a PC Bomberman released on Steam That was as customizable and had as many modes as atomic Bomberman right with the mod ability of a PC game, you know in terms of maps and characters and power-ups and all these sorts of things and game mode rules and Bring it back to the real original cute Bomberman graphics and not the scary dark evil Bomberman.

791
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,887
Rym: Well, there is another low-hanging fruit.

792
00:49:05,927 --> 00:49:09,300
Rym: I mean, you know our egregiously unrealized potential panel from fax.

793
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:11,747
Rym: Well, what are you complain about the most?

794
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:18,080
Rym: the fact that we don't have just good DS games with the shared screen on the TV And everyone's got their own screen.

795
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:22,540
Scott: That would be a good game as if you had a Bomberman much like Pac Man verse on the GameCube.

796
00:49:22,741 --> 00:49:27,356
Rym: If four friends sit down with four DS's and there's a big man aiming too low.

797
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:29,764
Scott: eight DS's 16 DS's you can.

798
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:31,450
Scott: only it can only handle eight technologically.

799
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:32,513
Rym: Yeah, we could write something.

800
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:33,156
Rym: No, you can't.

801
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:33,758
Rym: they could do something.

802
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:35,525
Scott: It only supports eight.

803
00:49:35,585 --> 00:49:46,111
Scott: It's the limit in the wireless bandwidth besides the Wii's that we have a new Wii eventually Maybe but right now with the technology that exists today Somebody could make an eight player Bomberman where you have eight DS's.

804
00:49:46,593 --> 00:49:49,000
Scott: everyone has a DS right and you don't need a cable.

805
00:49:49,383 --> 00:49:51,500
Scott: So it's not a Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles situation.

806
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,599
Scott: You can't complain because if you complain you don't have to buy a cable and what you don't have a DS.

807
00:49:56,903 --> 00:49:57,539
Scott: What's wrong with you?

808
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,740
Scott: Right and you'll need one Wii and one disc to load up the game on the Wii.

809
00:50:02,101 --> 00:50:07,040
Scott: Right and then you can have eight people playing Bomberman where they can see their stuff on their DS screen.

810
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:14,368
Scott: But also there's the main screen on the television and you could play ridiculous Ridiculous Bomberman with that kind of setup, right?

811
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:17,199
Scott: It would be off the hook, but no one's made it.

812
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:18,866
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's a no-brainer.

813
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:36,255
Rym: but then again, it's not a no-brainer for making money Because games like that I mean Crystal Chronicles was an important game Zelda Four Swords those were really pushing the boundaries and what console gaming could be and Every game company in the world has said yeah, that's not worth as much money as things like Wii Sports.

814
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:42,760
Scott: Yeah, it's like I could Just make my own right because Bomberman is one of the easiest games to make in the world.

815
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:44,632
Scott: I mean, it's it's pretty straightforward, right?

816
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:47,068
Scott: I mean they made it for the NES I mean demons to diamonds.

817
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:48,900
Scott: Yeah, that's also really straightforward.

818
00:50:50,401 --> 00:50:53,279
Scott: But it's like I don't want to get sued here and it's pretty much.

819
00:50:54,064 --> 00:50:56,820
Scott: You know, there were have been Bomberman clones in the past.

820
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:58,008
Scott: I mean, I remember there was some.

821
00:50:58,028 --> 00:50:59,559
Scott: I can't remember the name of that game.

822
00:51:00,243 --> 00:51:05,709
Scott: I think I think it might have been like atomic bomb man or Call it bowling ball candle.

823
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:06,553
Scott: Yeah, it was something.

824
00:51:06,694 --> 00:51:10,140
Scott: it wasn't called Bomberman But it was a single-player game that had the same mechanic.

825
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,900
Scott: It was obviously stolen from Bomberman where you drop the bomb and you run away and it blows up and the whole thing, right?

826
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:18,613
Scott: And there have been quite a few clones, but none of them are really gotten anywhere.

827
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:23,390
Scott: and it really even if I cloned it It wouldn't feel right playing Bomberman if it didn't have.

828
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:24,474
Scott: you know, white bomber.

829
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:36,920
Rym: Well, there's that air of Legitimacy like when I when you beat someone at a real Bomberman game you at least know Alright that this was technically a legit Bomberman like the Emperor Nintendo or the Emperor Hudson.

830
00:51:36,942 --> 00:51:45,447
Scott: Yeah That is because the theme because the styling of atomic Bomberman is so dossish and dark when you win at it Doesn't feel like a legit Bomberman game.

831
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:46,873
Scott: I think that's its problem right?

832
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:47,074
Scott: is?

833
00:51:47,254 --> 00:51:54,323
Scott: it's almost like, you know It's like you can play baseball with a referee or you can just go down to the field with a stick and a ball And it's like.

834
00:51:54,343 --> 00:51:55,573
Scott: does that really count if you win?

835
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:56,400
Scott: Not really.

836
00:51:56,801 --> 00:52:05,159
Rym: I do encourage all of you though listeners a lot a lot of people and there's even article on slashdot about the death of Like shared screen co-op and it's true to a big degree.

837
00:52:06,241 --> 00:52:16,576
Rym: One of the greatest gaming experiences you can have is to physically have two or three other people in the room with you Playing a single screen direct versus video game.

838
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:22,680
Rym: Mm-hmm And I think a lot of people are missing that experience today and you're really as a gamer doing yourself a disservice.

839
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:27,940
Scott: Yeah, I mean in terms of games where there's multiple players like more than two in direct versus, right?

840
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,659
Scott: So the fighting games are out and the sports games are out because those are all two players, right?

841
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:35,590
Scott: This is for player on modern systems, right?

842
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,520
Scott: You got Mario Tennis, but that's two on two co-op, right?

843
00:52:38,801 --> 00:52:41,409
Scott: You got Power Stone, but that died right.

844
00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:42,593
Scott: Power Stone was the shit.

845
00:52:42,774 --> 00:52:44,720
Rym: Oh my god, we should do a show on Power Stone?

846
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,267
Rym: I don't know.

847
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,280
Scott: I haven't really played power.

848
00:52:46,421 --> 00:52:49,880
Rym: I played the ever-living crap out of that when I used to go to like anime central.

849
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:53,180
Scott: Yeah, I mean Power Stone is the shit that needs to come back in a major way.

850
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,507
Scott: It's good for the same reasons as Bomberman right?

851
00:52:55,868 --> 00:52:57,272
Scott: You got like Smash Brothers.

852
00:52:57,513 --> 00:53:03,980
Scott: That's a fighting game kind of right, you know There's really not a whole lot in the department of one screen.

853
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:07,330
Scott: Not a split screen like they do with the halo or whatever.

854
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:14,294
Scott: right one screen more than two players Every man for himself everyone versus everyone else.

855
00:53:14,355 --> 00:53:15,640
Scott: direct, you know.

856
00:53:17,308 --> 00:53:18,600
Scott: You know competition video game.

857
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:24,978
Rym: Well, there's something about many more than Bomberman something about being in the same room where the trash talk is right there.

858
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:25,640
Rym: It is intimate.

859
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:26,798
Rym: There's no way around it.

860
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:33,920
Rym: You can hear every groan every elbowing every blocking the screen as you're every hitting the other guy's controller.

861
00:53:36,668 --> 00:53:37,967
Rym: I Don't know.

862
00:53:38,008 --> 00:53:40,282
Rym: I grew up on that and I you know A lot of times.

863
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:46,583
Rym: there are aspects of so-called old-school gaming that I believe they made me the game I am today.

864
00:53:46,884 --> 00:53:52,765
Rym: but at the same time I recognize that we cannot and should not want to go back to those days Because they did suck.

865
00:53:52,886 --> 00:53:54,594
Scott: really, you know, but I think you know.

866
00:53:54,634 --> 00:53:58,448
Scott: the point is what other game Can you find that has all those aspects that Bomberman has?

867
00:53:58,468 --> 00:53:59,952
Scott: what I said that is current.

868
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:05,170
Rym: this one thing the the shared room Shared space experience we don't get now.

869
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,940
Rym: you can emulate it pretty well with if the Xbox had a mode.

870
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:13,460
Rym: Well, you can play Bomberman and it has the screens in along the top of the faces of everyone else.

871
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,031
Scott: You're playing with with the web with the webcam.

872
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:17,919
Rym: Yeah, but I don't think they have anything like that.

873
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,658
Scott: No, yeah, I mean Uno has it but I don't think Bomberman has that feature also.

874
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,313
Rym: This bothers me how annoying it is.

875
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:26,714
Rym: Like.

876
00:54:26,735 --> 00:54:29,165
Rym: if you want to play this game online You're just like BAM and you just go.

877
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:32,880
Rym: you want to play the new Bomberman with like four or five people locally.

878
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:38,460
Rym: It's actually a giant pain in the ass to get everyone signed into a profile and it just it's good.

879
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,953
Rym: That is who it is actually.

880
00:54:40,175 --> 00:54:42,507
Scott: one thing I think is advantageous for the Wii.

881
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:45,800
Scott: everyone's god we internet sucks and it does sucks bad.

882
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,960
Scott: But Xbox if you want to play locally, right?

883
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,100
Scott: It forces you because it's like uses your avatars or whatever to actually choose a profile for every player.

884
00:54:54,581 --> 00:54:57,309
Scott: You have to create all these offline profiles for everyone.

885
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:58,974
Scott: you have to select them every time.

886
00:54:59,074 --> 00:55:05,119
Rym: also a lot of games don't allow You to have like two people local playing against other people somewhere else.

887
00:55:05,561 --> 00:55:08,353
Rym: Yeah, a lot of them are either all online or nothing online.

888
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,296
Scott: That's such a pain.

889
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:10,100
Scott: It's not cool.

890
00:55:10,491 --> 00:55:11,804
Rym: Yeah It's just.

891
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:13,760
Rym: it's an example of how far we've come in gaming.

892
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,536
Rym: Like we make leaps and bounds and gaming is a million times better now than it was in some aspects.

893
00:55:18,522 --> 00:55:30,110
Scott: I mean, this is this is a professionally made game But it's making the same kind of mistakes that we always yell at indie game companies for making but it shows you that it's not You know a problem to any to either or it's a problem in general

894
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:30,311
Rym: for

895
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,053
Scott: all of gaming.

896
00:55:31,093 --> 00:55:33,800
Scott: people are missing very important details.

897
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,980
Rym: They are only mistakes from the perspective of good game design.

898
00:55:38,141 --> 00:55:40,837
Rym: They are not mistakes from the perspective of making money.

899
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,911
Rym: That's right, because I'm sure there is no one who would have bought that.

900
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:50,607
Rym: Bomberman who said oh the multiplayer local doesn't work Exactly the way it should.

901
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:52,540
Rym: I'm not gonna buy that for a dollar.

902
00:55:52,721 --> 00:55:54,627
Scott: I mean we tried the trial out which is one.

903
00:55:54,808 --> 00:56:00,013
Scott: the one greatest thing about Xbox that beats everything else is every single game Has a free trial, but what we played it.

904
00:56:00,053 --> 00:56:03,050
Rym: We're like, yeah Bomberman Let's just play the trial right now so we can just play it.

905
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,617
Scott: and then we were met after the trial.

906
00:56:04,717 --> 00:56:06,219
Rym: after the trial I wasn't gonna buy it.

907
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:11,020
Scott: The only reason I didn't buy it because I bought this game.

908
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:16,400
Rym: I went from 100% buy to 90% not buy just from playing the trial once.

909
00:56:16,942 --> 00:56:20,120
Rym: But then Aaron C was over and we needed a multiplayer game to play and we're sitting down.

910
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:23,284
Rym: I was like, let's play some goddamn Bomberman I just bought it right.

911
00:56:23,304 --> 00:56:27,360
Scott: the thing is I already I have the Wii Bomberman the the first WiiWare one.

912
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,780
Scott: It's not it's not battle fest, which I think is coming to WiiWare.

913
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,320
Scott: It's the original WiiWare Bomberman and that will suffice for being the Bomberman at my house, you know.

914
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,873
Scott: So I don't need to buy the Xbox Bomberman.

915
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:40,521
