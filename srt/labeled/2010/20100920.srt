1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:17,746
Rym: Hey, it's Thursday, September 20th, I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight with the roll of the dice men in space Or something like that.

2
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,427
Scott: Let's do this.

3
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:35,663
Rym: So I recall some years ago We didn't do a show one night because a building collapsed on the train that me and Scott and Emily all need to get out Of the city.

4
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:36,773
Scott: Well knee dead.

5
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:36,853
Scott: Yep

6
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:51,857
Rym: So I remember then I was the only one in my company that I knew of affected by this and everyone kind of laughed Like good luck getting home as I walked out the door and we had all of our you know That's shenanigans journey of getting dinner and taking Amtrak and then that scary-ass cab ride.

7
00:00:51,877 --> 00:01:00,620
Rym: Yep so this year the The bridge the only bridge connecting these train lines to the rest of the world just fucking caught on fire.

8
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:04,599
Scott: Well, there was a fire near the bridge which me it might not have been the bridge itself.

9
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,800
Scott: It might have just been some, you know train equipment such as signals near the bridge.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,602
Rym: Well what I read?

11
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:15,740
Rym: I saw pictures of a video online but what I saw the wooden pylons holding the bridge up were on fire.

12
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,240
Rym: Whoa, like way on fire.

13
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:22,940
Rym: But they started using two of the tracks again, and it wasn't that bad.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,836
Rym: But it was funny how this time I see this notice because I forgot to unsubscribe from the oh shit.

15
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:28,859
Rym: alerts from into MTA.

16
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:30,480
Rym: So I get this text.

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,830
Rym: I'm like, oh Metro North is on fire and there's no trains.

18
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:44,760
Rym: and two of my co-workers who had been kind of snickering when that To me last time now live on Metro North lines And the tide was turned and I didn't give a shit and it was hilarious.

19
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,539
Rym: I was giving them advice like oh good luck getting home.

20
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:54,686
Scott: Actually, what they did is they had the trains just run to the Yankee Stadium station And yeah You take the subway to get there to go.

21
00:01:54,747 --> 00:02:01,219
Scott: basically take the subway which is not on fire past the on fire bridge Using the non on fire subway bridge.

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,520
Scott: Remember that trains are on the other side.

23
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,120
Rym: They had the new station on the other side and they were set up to use it.

24
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:16,140
Rym: So they basically apparent out my guess is after the problem last time they came up with a plan for if there's trouble in Manhattan Can they make the rest of the train line work?

25
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,040
Rym: Cuz last time none of the trains ran anywhere because I didn't have a place to like turn them around switch tracks or anything.

26
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:22,346
Scott: Yep, also today.

27
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:32,960
Scott: Apparently there's a bunch of UN action because you know I was biking at work this morning and I get over to Manhattan and then it's like hey This road's closed and I bike past a little sign.

28
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,190
Scott: It's like you agree to security checks.

29
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,500
Scott: if you go past here and I'm like, oh, this is fantastic.

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,400
Rym: Yeah, 42nd Street had like a middle lane that they so did 57th Street at the middle lane.

31
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:43,888
Rym: I watched a motorcade go by.

32
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:56,220
Rym: I don't know what country or what limo or whatever it was But in the middle of the motorcade on either side of the limo where I guess The guy was were two vans with no doors on either side and there were guys with mounted machine guns.

33
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:57,995
Scott: I don't understand right?

34
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:58,499
Scott: why?

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,649
Scott: If You're in a motorcade, right?

36
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:09,480
Scott: Yeah, it's like cop car Like SUV SUV SUV the limo maybe another limo right vans, right?

37
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:13,056
Scott: If I was the important person, I would not be in the little.

38
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:13,980
Rym: I was the important person.

39
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,019
Rym: I'd be dressed as a cop on one of the motorcycles all secret like.

40
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,260
Rym: well The thing is you got body double in the limo.

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,919
Scott: The thing is that's a little risky because you might just fall off the motorcycle.

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,000
Scott: Yeah, right, but I would just be like in the cop car, you know in like the back.

43
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,549
Rym: So Scott you ever see a clear and present danger.

44
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,115
Rym: No, that doesn't help you.

45
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:33,565
Scott: Oh They took out the whole motorcade now.

46
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:35,874
Rym: Yeah, they took out the whole motorcade except for Harrison.

47
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:42,119
Scott: if I was a bad guy I would use RPGs to take out every car in the motorcade just in case it was smart.

48
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:44,394
Rym: It was a little like I'm used to.

49
00:03:44,414 --> 00:03:45,200
Rym: you know, we live in New York.

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,294
Rym: I'm used to people with machine guns hanging around and I'm used to that.

51
00:03:49,334 --> 00:04:00,020
Rym: Well submachine guns assault rifle This is the first time I saw Actual machine guns as in mounted on on some sort of swively bit much as it not an m4 but a para.

52
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,813
Rym: Yeah, not a not a carbine.

53
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:05,002
Rym: Not a car It's carbine.

54
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:05,664
Scott: It's fine.

55
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:06,887
Rym: I'll be fine.

56
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,993
Scott: No beans are what you trade for in bonanza.

57
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:15,434
Rym: Say I got the ultra rare carbine and Only CT's can have you RT.

58
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:16,178
Scott: I dropped for you.

59
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:21,569
Rym: But the reason it was eerie was I realized that I thought about this What if I had set up the motorcade?

60
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,015
Rym: why would I have that gun?

61
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:30,798
Rym: there's only one answer Why you would have those guns on either side of the main car to spray the crowd with suppressive fire while you escape?

62
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,391
Rym: Yeah Yeah, and I was in that crowd.

63
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:39,942
Scott: That's alright No, so I had to like bike all the way around and on the way home I just like I fuck Whatever.

64
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:47,659
Scott: I went north before I went because the thing is I biked past all these fancy hotels Where apparently they were all staying and that was why it was all locked down.

65
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:50,843
Rym: Mm-hmm, so Tech day.

66
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:51,787
Rym: We haven't done tech show.

67
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,575
Rym: We had this dearth of tech shows for all.

68
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:58,857
Rym: we did a really good tech show last time for a long time and then we started coming back in force, but we had a delay.

69
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:02,119
Rym: so we got a. I know we got to keep the game very high on the tech episodes.

70
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,767
Scott: I will see if we can do that.

71
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,418
Rym: So we'll get to what our topic is in a little bit.

72
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:09,199
Scott: And the meantime, let's do some news.

73
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:18,010
Rym: there is actually very important news, but we didn't get to talk about it when it happened for various reasons, but You all know HDCP at least I hope you know what HDCP is.

74
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:40,240
Rym: it's the thing that damn crap pola Theoretically prevents you from connecting non authorized digital output devices to Devices that are protected with HDCP for video and audio is a movie and you have a fancy TV and the T. if the TV supports HDCP and the device does you get the ultra high resolution?

75
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,860
Rym: But if your device doesn't support it they give you crappy resolution.

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,940
Scott: Well, no, it's it's that the TV has not about the device about the TV, right?

77
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,784
Scott: So what?

78
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:50,676
Scott: basically it's a macro vision for the 21st century?

79
00:05:51,420 --> 00:06:06,243
Scott: So you have a blu-ray player and there's an HDMI cable coming out of the blu-ray player and on that HDMI cable there's some HD video and audio and Surround sound audio and they don't want you taking that video and audio off of that HDMI cable putting it Into.

80
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:14,398
Scott: some say, you know a recording device like a you know HDMI capture card in your computer and Recording that blu-ray disc basically copying it.

81
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:21,629
Rym: now Never mind the fact that I can still get an SD rip which is Almost as good and then I can just copy that.

82
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,620
Scott: Well, this thing is still be macro vision also, so it'll be going bright dark.

83
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,480
Rym: Now I don't think macro vision.

84
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,612
Scott: It's still in there though.

85
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:30,539
Scott: It's still there.

86
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:33,019
Scott: This is basically it prevents you.

87
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:39,011
Scott: it only stops you if you're doing it the stupid way like you plug a VCR and your blu-ray player that it'll stop you from doing that.

88
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:44,880
Scott: but Basically what it does is it checks to make sure that your TV is like a legit real TV.

89
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:47,740
Scott: If you try to make your own TV is not gonna work, right?

90
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:48,894
Scott: It's even if it's an HD TV.

91
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:54,868
Scott: If it doesn't have this fancy secret code in it Then the it'll just get SD.

92
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:58,039
Scott: the blu-ray player will refuse to put HD out the cable.

93
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:09,440
Rym: now There was that study a while ago that pointed out that the majority of American households who think they have a high-definition Television don't even know they don't have it set up and they couldn't tell if it was set up correctly or not.

94
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:10,458
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

95
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:14,000
Rym: But all that aside obviously, this is bullshit.

96
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:21,820
Scott: I shouldn't need you know special don't because you can just put your blu-ray disc in your computer and use handbrake and the HDCP doesn't even come into it.

97
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,520
Rym: I'll get to that later.

98
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:30,393
Rym: But I shouldn't need to digitally sign my TV to watch something that I legally bought Because the real problem here isn't that the pirates can get around it.

99
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,180
Rym: The Pirates can always get around it.

100
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,805
Rym: Nothing you do will stop the Pirates.

101
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:38,300
Rym: In fact, all you can do is hurt the people who paid by implementing stuff like this.

102
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:42,340
Rym: Yeah, my moral argument is that if I buy a piece of technology.

103
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:48,023
Rym: I should have the legal right to do whatever the fuck I want with it and with whatever the fuck I want with the outputs Of it now.

104
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,893
Rym: I'm I might break some other law and get prosecuted for that.

105
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,422
Rym: Like if I kill Scott with my TV Yeah, it's like.

106
00:07:53,783 --> 00:08:06,439
Scott: should it be okay to make a gun that doesn't shoot if you point it at a person right or it's like The gun will only go off if you're doing something legal with it You know, like if you try to shoot a target, but if you aim at anything else, it won't work.

107
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,030
Scott: now Some people might think that's a good idea.

108
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:09,440
Rym: I actually think that'd be a cool idea.

109
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:15,779
Rym: Yeah, but I mean it's basically the same principle but at the same time it should be okay to circumvent those things for your own use.

110
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:26,259
Rym: hmm Regardless HDCP didn't stop anyone but people who legitimately bought stuff and wanted to watch it legally and it has no effect on the pirates.

111
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,491
Rym: and It got broken as we expected.

112
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:34,962
Scott: because like all DRM It didn't get broken by hacking got broken by someone leaking the key I heard.

113
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:37,470
Rym: the thing is no one has confirmed that the key was leaked.

114
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:48,660
Rym: Very likely the key was reverse engineered because Mathematically DRM can't work because the devices that do the decoding are in the hands of the consumers.

115
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:55,263
Scott: Yeah So it's like I give you a DVD and the DVD has a lock on it and you need to be able to watch The DVD.

116
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:56,890
Scott: so I give you the key, right?

117
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,940
Scott: So you unlock the lock and you watch the DVD.

118
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:00,685
Scott: Okay.

119
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:01,390
Scott: All right.

120
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,599
Scott: So there you go.

121
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:09,320
Scott: The key is in your TV, you know, so you really the thing is it's you know.

122
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,839
Scott: So you're only unlocking the blu-ray disc when you watch it on your TV.

123
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,420
Scott: But if you can just get the key out of the TV somehow then you can unlock the blu-ray disc whenever you want.

124
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,102
Rym: Think about this.

125
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:20,410
Rym: We already know a truism of computer security.

126
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,520
Rym: Is that if someone has physical access to the device you're fucked?

127
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:24,102
Scott: Yep.

128
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:29,620
Rym: Now you can encrypt data and someone can get physical access and not be able to get to that data.

129
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:34,439
Rym: But that requires that the key to unlock that data is not on the device.

130
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:54,809
Rym: So All it takes to break any DRM you will ever see is some manner of reverse engineering and in this case Apparently it took about 40 or 50 non sequential public keys and then you could derive the private key with the right computing equipment And the guess is someone did that.

131
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:01,154
Rym: Yeah, so awesome and Intel's already like yeah I will DMCA the shit out of any who tries to use this too late.

132
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:01,676
Scott: I like how.

133
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:02,620
Rym: it's a nice short number.

134
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:07,850
Rym: I'm sure people already are getting this number like tattooed on their backs Just like they did with CSS.

135
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,480
Rym: Yeah, we should make some songs.

136
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,255
Rym: I think we sang the first bits of CSS on the show a long time ago.

137
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,178
Scott: I don't remember that.

138
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:16,486
Scott: Anyway, that's good.

139
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:21,163
Scott: Uh, here's an interesting story that I'm not sure if I like this or not But I want to.

140
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:23,634
Scott: I want to talk about it because it's an interesting.

141
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:24,940
Scott: someone had a clever idea.

142
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:26,929
Scott: That doesn't seem.

143
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,120
Scott: it seems shady, but whatever so easily.

144
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,602
Scott: Captchas right.

145
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:31,024
Scott: Hmm.

146
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:40,631
Scott: We all have captchas and all our websites because they're useful and it's really the only way we have of Keeping like just spam robots from doing things that are evil, right?

147
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:47,560
Scott: You know, if I have a form for like a poll or Registration on my forum or even e-commerce, right?

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:04,860
Scott: if I don't put some sort of capture then somebody can trivially write a tiny script that will hammer my website and Just do whatever the submit the form over and over and over again And maybe post a zillion posts on my blog or do something really annoying and spam the fuck out of me, right?

149
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,534
Rym: I'm curious what you're gonna talk about because there's the the Turing test question.

150
00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:09,920
Rym: There's the disabled access question.

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,724
Scott: I know there's.

152
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:16,407
Scott: there's some company called solve media and what they've done is That the problem with captchas right?

153
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,331
Scott: is that you know?

154
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:19,420
Scott: is that they're annoying for regular people to do?

155
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:22,275
Scott: You know because they look at it and sometimes they don't even get it right.

156
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:26,320
Scott: or the you know Normal people don't like captchas that they're bothered by them.

157
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:35,660
Scott: And in fact if you had like a capture solving tool you could probably just sell it to normal people not even to spammers just Regular old actual legitimate humans because they hate having to fill out captures.

158
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:47,457
Scott: So what this company has done is they made a new kind of capture where instead of looking at some weird letters that are all Jumbly, it's an advertisement and you have to type in the quote, you know, what's in the advertisement?

159
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:50,106
Rym: Wow, that is Brilliantly evil.

160
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:51,940
Scott: Yeah, so look here's an example, right?

161
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:52,642
Rym: Brilliant.

162
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:53,986
Scott: and this is an example.

163
00:11:54,046 --> 00:12:01,067
Scott: and the example says Windows Internet Explorer 8 and as an IE has an inner Explorer logo Clearly they're selling Internet 8.

164
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,854
Rym: so that's what I will type and then it says no.

165
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:04,220
Scott: and then it says browse safer.

166
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:07,180
Scott: And then it says please enter the quoted text.

167
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:19,930
Scott: You would type in browse safer and if somebody was using some sort of you know Digital imaging like something that would read the text in the image It would read Internet Explorer 8 or browse, you know And it might not that it might not know.

168
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,292
Rym: that it's only supposed to type in the quoted text just escalates the arms race in a way because they they could.

169
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:34,978
Rym: I mean if they know the Basic namespace or the basic question space they could do things like alright It asks for quoted something OCR for quotes and then do the stuff in between.

170
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:37,790
Scott: but no The thing is it'd be like a different questions for each ad.

171
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,940
Rym: Oh, yeah, but you could probably come up.

172
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:46,020
Rym: I mean basically one way to solve captures if they don't have a wide enough space is to have a human who works.

173
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:47,948
Scott: Porn companies do it right?

174
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:52,219
Scott: is you sign up for the porn site and in order to sign up for the porn site You have to do like 10 captions.

175
00:12:52,561 --> 00:13:00,620
Scott: But those captions are actually captures for another site and the guy who with the porn site Uses the captions that you solve to go and send spam to someone else.

176
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,192
Rym: I'm curious how you discovered this fact that porn sites do.

177
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:04,880
Scott: this is news about it everywhere.

178
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,389
Scott: Uh-huh a lot of it's not.

179
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,239
Rym: just have you solved zero?

180
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,346
Scott: Well, you mean you know.

181
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:12,460
Scott: not, you know, I haven't solved any catches that weren't for me.

182
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:16,500
Rym: But The I always thought a better way.

183
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,480
Rym: I mean the ad thing that's brilliant is you're gonna make brilliant from the making money person exactly what I'm saying.

184
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,764
Scott: It's a guaranteed impression.

185
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:28,240
Rym: The person guaranteed has read the ad thought about it and typed something they had to interact with your ad.

186
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:29,651
Rym: It's brilliant and fuck them.

187
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:30,418
Rym: Mm-hmm.

188
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,191
Rym: but at the same time I think a non-evil way to go about it would be to have a picture of say a cat and they have to.

189
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:43,311
Rym: you have to type in English what it is and Fuzzy guessing and if they don't get it, well, they didn't pass the Turing test.

190
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:43,893
Scott: Yep.

191
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:45,680
Scott: That's that's a good way to do it.

192
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:46,760
Rym: Yeah, well, there is the trouble.

193
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,647
Scott: What is this cat with captures?

194
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,560
Rym: that some people are just not smart enough to pass a capture?

195
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,460
Rym: But I feel like that's a good idea because it filters out people.

196
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:57,066
Rym: I mean if someone it's a good idea.

197
00:13:57,107 --> 00:14:00,460
Scott: if you have if you're looking if you're filtering out blog comments or something like that.

198
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:06,579
Scott: It's a bad idea if you're say E-commerce saying it's like well the stupid person isn't gonna give me their money now.

199
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:14,651
Rym: But at the same time do you want to do business with the stupid person when your credit card gets charged back because the shirt Didn't arrive because they gave you the wrong address.

200
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:16,260
Scott: I'll say I'm not gonna deny money.

201
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:17,800
Scott: It's like hey in football, right?

202
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,226
Scott: you never take points off the board.

203
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:30,462
Scott: if you kick a field goal and it was three points and it's good and you have a Chance to like do over the play or you could deny because there was a penalty Do not redo the play Ever.

204
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,429
Scott: do not take points off the board.

205
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:37,347
Scott: if you're a company and you have money sent over the wire Do not undo the money.

206
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:37,869
Scott: It's money.

207
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:39,977
Scott: It's good score money.

208
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:47,016
Rym: Yes So we had trouble actually coming up with what show to do tonight because we've been so focused on.

209
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,040
Rym: you know gaming after you.

210
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,867
Scott: Don't do things today first.

211
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:50,992
Rym: We're still in the opening bit here.

212
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:52,759
Rym: All right, I think we can do this now.

213
00:14:53,321 --> 00:15:08,063
Rym: We did not decide what to do the show on and I was going through this whole list of shows that Emily compiled from forum Suggestions and the two we came up with that are the best I guess topics for us to talk out of our asses about our Nuclear weapons.

214
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,372
Scott: I know I thought it was space exploration.

215
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,922
Rym: Oh, yeah space exploration that works, too Uh-huh.

216
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:14,649
Rym: I guess you don't want to talk about the nuclear vessels.

217
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,552
Scott: Not really.

218
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:18,468
Rym: No, you don't you don't admit that we'll talk about that later.

219
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:18,629
Rym: then.

220
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,304
Rym: or Presentation software.

221
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:24,440
Rym: So I got this d6 here on a one two or three.

222
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,849
Rym: We're talking about space exploration on a four or five or six.

223
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:30,637
Rym: We're talking about presentation software.

224
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:43,001
Scott: Alrighty It's a - it's - Which one was that?

225
00:15:52,900 --> 00:16:00,277
Rym: So things of the day this is definitely been making the rounds But I want to bring it up because I have an extra bit of hilarity from this.

226
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,993
Rym: This is a video of two dudes in Brooklyn or three dudes in Brooklyn I can't quite tell how many dudes and they're in their apartment.

227
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:09,303
Rym: and a Couple of weekends ago.

228
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:12,780
Rym: There was a thunderstorm in New York, which is kind of a rare occurrence.

229
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,981
Rym: It's very rare that a thunderstorm a real thunderstorm actually enters the borders of New York One.

230
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:18,744
Scott: that's really.

231
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:21,073
Scott: I mean, there's some where it's like rumble rumble lightning light.

232
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:36,800
Rym: Yeah, but it's rare that it's like Basically cut storms apart and sends them around the city and these dudes Lose their shit about this tornado because that tornado went through Brooklyn and another tornado went through Staten Island.

233
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:37,852
Rym: That's crazy.

234
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:38,560
Rym: That never happens.

235
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:47,120
Rym: But it's funny watching this for me because I grew up in the Midwest around Detroit Where storms far worse than that and tornadoes much like that.

236
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:54,172
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty loud through like every other weekend and it was pretty powerful But it was small and it moved so fast.

237
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:54,976
Scott: Like I got home.

238
00:16:54,996 --> 00:17:02,226
Scott: I Did some stuff in the house the storm passed over and then it was quiet and then I went back outside Like as a kid.

239
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:07,200
Rym: that quick as a kid storms like that were the kind of storms We'd open the garage door and hang out in lawn chairs watching.

240
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:14,119
Scott: We'd only go inside if it looked like debris was gonna get thrown at us And then maybe you could even like close the garage door and look out the windows.

241
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:15,084
Rym: Yeah, are they?

242
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:19,702
Rym: if it was the worst it would ever get is we go down to the basement and watch out of the reinforced Glass.

243
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:22,855
Rym: Yeah, but that was if like the tornado was probably gonna hit the house.

244
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,020
Rym: Yeah, that was.

245
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,807
Rym: These guys really lose their shit.

246
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,097
Scott: Yeah, I think they were probably on some substances.

247
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:30,880
Rym: I don't think they were.

248
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,224
Rym: No, I don't think they were.

249
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,671
Rym: I mean to be fair to tell these days.

250
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:37,380
Rym: It was not a double tornado.

251
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:40,349
Scott: That guy wasn't on substances I know.

252
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,478
Scott: so it's the always the opposite of what you expect.

253
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:47,319
Scott: I Just want to pause to say that this is crazy blinking light out the window.

254
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:52,040
Scott: Look over there towards the end of the bridge on the side of one of the buildings.

255
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:02,990
Rym: Wow, I feel like that should be a thing of the day.

256
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,909
Rym: That is a really really bright light and it is like many many miles away from us.

257
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:14,690
Rym: It's on the other side of the river and it's blinking and it's like it looks like it's almost at the alt like a halfway down Manhattan like it's one of those buildings.

258
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:18,930
Scott: It's like one of those lights that you'll see blinking to like keep airplanes away from the top of a building.

259
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,070
Scott: But it's on during the day and it's not on the top of a high building.

260
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,660
Scott: It's on like the mid the side of a shorter building.

261
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,969
Rym: I cannot express to you how fucking bright this thing is.

262
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:28,837
Scott: It's really far It's like someone's.

263
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,200
Scott: it looks like, you know When you look at a stadium and someone flashes their camera and it goes like right.

264
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:36,250
Scott: it looks like that, but it's ridiculous.

265
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,829
Scott: It's like miles away, but that's what it looks like and it's repeating it pretty frequent intervals like flash.

266
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:46,355
Rym: My best guess is some sort of art welding Flash, but why is he flashing?

267
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,081
Scott: Why is he arc welding at regular intervals?

268
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:48,462
Scott: I don't know.

269
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:50,890
Rym: fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle.

270
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:52,317
Scott: It's like every.

271
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,884
Scott: it's like exactly every second.

272
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:54,929
Rym: That's really weird.

273
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:06,703
Rym: Hopefully we aren't going to die and then we'll tell you what that was a really reflective surface spinning and reflecting the sunlight But there's not that much sunlight left and how it's pretty sunny so slow and why?

274
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:08,287
Rym: as such a point source.

275
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:09,049
Scott: I don't know.

276
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:13,309
Rym: That is really bright anyway, she got a thing in the day other than that thing.

277
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:14,995
Scott: Here's my thing today.

278
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:17,001
Scott: All right, so I don't know.

279
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:19,469
Scott: people listening to Monday shows know about hell.

280
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:24,325
Scott: But anyway, here's the hell of the anime variety, you know anyhow.

281
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:28,520
Scott: and this Goku Yes, this these videos.

282
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:29,845
Scott: there are two of them.

283
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:31,270
Scott: They are quite hellish.

284
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:42,610
Scott: it's apparently from a movie called kuno ichi ninpocho, which is a Movie like a bad old movie about female ninjas and they all have a vagina bubble power.

285
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:47,030
Scott: That's all that tells you everything you need to know now about these stupid clips.

286
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,816
Scott: These are two clips from the movie.

287
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:52,950
Rym: the thing about the vagina bubble power is that you might be thinking maybe that's euphemism.

288
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:56,084
Rym: You might be thinking well, they're making some joke.

289
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:57,490
Rym: And when I see it, I'll get it now.

290
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,734
Scott: It's just like naked cars.

291
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:03,950
Rym: It is literally a vagina bubble just like utenna movie and naked fucking cars.

292
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:06,245
Rym: Yep, it's anime.

293
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:08,956
Rym: Hell is something I almost feel like any like.

294
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:20,293
Rym: I feel like we should do an internet equivalent like we should make our own like we sit on the couch and like a darkened room with like spotlights on our faces and we do anime hell as an hour-long show and Put it on the internet.

295
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:22,059
Rym: because non anime con going.

296
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,744
Rym: people do not know what anime hell is.

297
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:25,350
Rym: It has nothing to do with anime.

298
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:27,789
Scott: There's some animes in it.

299
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:40,980
Rym: sometimes there's anime in it but it Imagine taking a bunch of nerds and put them in a room at like midnight like 11 o'clock after they're exhausted from a day of conventioning and Showing them strange things with no context and no explanation.

300
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,550
Scott: lots of the kind of clips that you would see on late night.

301
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:48,890
Rym: Yeah, like remember that story from North America that thing a day from a while ago.

302
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,410
Rym: That was that was something we saw that was hellish at an anime hell.

303
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,998
Rym: That was like a seven out of ten on the jikoku scale.

304
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:55,319
Scott: Yep.

305
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,930
Scott: All right, so the meta moment about your thing today.

306
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,960
Rym: I already did a thing of the day captain.

307
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:02,810
Rym: All right, you know your face in that light.

308
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,639
Rym: Are you sure it's not a mind eraser?

309
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,990
Scott: I think it's a orbital mind control.

310
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:13,270
Rym: So metamoman You okay metamoman we're good doing the night.

311
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,925
Scott: So the New York comic-con slash anime festival is October 8th 9th and 10th.

312
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:19,580
Scott: We have a panel Friday night Which is 8 Friday night.

313
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:19,882
Rym: It is 730.

314
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:23,179
Scott: Yep So I guess we're not going to board game night.

315
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:26,260
Rym: I guess we're not going to board game night Which is the same exact time.

316
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,166
Rym: This will be the first board game night I've missed in a while, but that's fine.

317
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:29,489
Scott: That's fine.

318
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:33,345
Rym: Also that weekend 10 10 10 is all weekend.

319
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:34,270
Rym: That's the burning wheel calm.

320
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:39,910
Scott: Yeah, I don't know I don't know how much if I'm gonna go to the big con on Saturday and Sunday if we're only doing one panel there now.

321
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,930
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to the burning con something fierce.

322
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:48,950
Scott: Yeah The burning con actually I found out is full up now like they've reached the fire marshal number of the space that they have gotten.

323
00:21:49,131 --> 00:21:52,227
Rym: Well, then kids stuff you didn't pre-register don't go.

324
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:55,690
Scott: Yeah Well, I mean he is a thread on the burning wheel forum.

325
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,381
Scott: That's like if you want to go and you haven't registered yet post here.

326
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,329
Scott: So we'll see how that goes.

327
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,700
Scott: What else is meta?

328
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,584
Scott: There's not that much.

329
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:15,939
Scott: Oh one thing the nerd NYC who does the board game night also is doing this Gotham Gaming Guild thing, right and Basically the way it works is in the month of October.

330
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:23,442
Scott: There are three RPG sessions in New York City and If you do this, you have to do all three sessions.

331
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:25,050
Scott: You can't be like, I'm just going to one.

332
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:26,339
Scott: No, you have to do all three.

333
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:27,789
Scott: if you can't do all three don't sign up.

334
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:31,404
Rym: I'll sign up under an assumed name and if they suck I just won't show up.

335
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:33,209
Scott: it costs actual money though That's fine.

336
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:36,179
Rym: So money not as valuable as time.

337
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:39,689
Scott: and basically there's five games with five GM's and you sign up and you have.

338
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:48,224
Scott: you give like Your first second and third choices of which game you want to do and then they put you in a game and you have even If you didn't get your first choice, you still have to go.

339
00:22:48,344 --> 00:23:01,270
Scott: Yes dangerous It's like you committed, you know You're in and then you basically pay money which they use to rent the space with the tables And you go to the three sessions and you play an RPG for three sessions and I am doing a free market game.

340
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:07,519
Scott: So if you want to play free markets, it's October 1st October 15th and October 29th at 7 p.m.

341
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:15,310
Scott: And Go to nerd NYC forum and this threads about it and you can sign up and all that jazz.

342
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:16,514
Scott: So there you go.

343
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:22,272
Rym: All right, so space exploration is actually recently a very hot topic among nerds Mm-hmm.

344
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:23,114
Rym: I wonder why?

345
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:30,969
Rym: maybe because we don't have a lot of money anymore and Nerds really want us explore space because we want to live in space someday.

346
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:32,890
Scott: Well, I think the thing is right.

347
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:40,080
Scott: It's like we look at all this other technology that we have and the power of this technology is advanced So much in such a short time.

348
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:44,157
Scott: right like especially computers, you know I mean the first the Apollo guys.

349
00:23:44,177 --> 00:23:51,689
Scott: they had like a Commodore 64 to go to the moon with and now we've got like Pentium azillions, so shouldn't we be able to go to ten moons?

350
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,719
Scott: You know instead of just one moon, but no we can't.

351
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,530
Scott: and I think the real problem is simply the laws of physics.

352
00:23:58,113 --> 00:24:01,870
Scott: It's really really difficult to get the hell out of here because gravity sucks.

353
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:11,970
Scott: You need a lot of energy and no matter how fancy your technology is You need a lot of energy which is expensive and difficult and you need fucking rocket fuel and it sucks.

354
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:13,156
Rym: I think more to the point.

355
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:28,513
Rym: I'm an advocate of unmanned and Scientific space exploration but there's a certain impatience among a lot of people who want us to explore space in that Even if we invent even if we put like half of our national resources toward space exploration We're not good.

356
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:30,901
Rym: It'll be generations to get the technology.

357
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:31,362
Rym: We want.

358
00:24:31,422 --> 00:24:38,250
Scott: probably it'll be generations and generations Before we figure out crazy chase the laws of physics don't even get in our way and we don't run out of fuel.

359
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:42,030
Rym: Yeah, I mean it could be the old Devine hypothesis come to bite us in the ass.

360
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,550
Scott: Yeah, maybe you should explain that for the people who don't know it.

361
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,570
Rym: It was an idea and there are a number of other similar theories, but we don't know if it's true.

362
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,490
Rym: It's a hypothesis You can lump and it actually was kind of discredited because it made very specific predictions.

363
00:24:53,951 --> 00:25:10,126
Rym: but you can boil all these different kinds of hypotheses together into one idea that it is possible that a planet like Earth has a Finite number of chances to escape its own Orbit and achieve permanent settlement outside before the planet isn't gonna leave the orbit.

364
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:11,450
Scott: there's something on the planet.

365
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:13,199
Rym: The civil is the planet.

366
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:26,108
Rym: as in things from the planet have one shot To make it out and make a colony that turns into like one of those Michio Kaku level 1 level 2 level 3 civilizations Before they use up all the easily accessible latent energy on the planet.

367
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:39,344
Rym: now Some people have gone one step further and argued that you only get one chance to industrialize And if you don't get to a kind of post energy scarcity society before you use up all the limited resources You're done and it's caveman times forever.

368
00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:40,410
Scott: Yeah, cuz think about it, right?

369
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,540
Scott: You got this big planet.

370
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,770
Scott: It's a big rock, right?

371
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,970
Scott: It's only has so much fuel and energy in it and you're getting more from the Sun.

372
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,250
Rym: But it's now we could get energy from the Sun.

373
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:59,527
Rym: but it's gonna take a lot of resources that aren't from the Sun to theoretically to build up the technology to Usefully utilize the Sun enough to achieve high levels of usefulness.

374
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:08,109
Scott: exactly So you you have this fuel and you use it and you have to use the fuel to build up a society And to build rockets and to build whatever.

375
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:17,900
Scott: But you have to build you have to get your whole society to the point where you can get people living on another planet Right with only the fuel you have.

376
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:22,930
Scott: and you can't get more fuel very easily You can just get it trickling in from the Sun very slowly.

377
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:34,789
Scott: So it is really it's like you have one chance Maybe to get out and if you miss that chance You're just stuck on your earth or wherever planet you're on forever Unless aliens come to save you or something like that.

378
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:41,049
Rym: Now the original Olduvai theory really said that an industrial civilization has like a hundred years to exist.

379
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,223
Rym: And we've made it about a hundred years without trouble.

380
00:26:45,926 --> 00:26:50,210
Scott: and it looks like, you know Even with the doomsayers out there, right?

381
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,856
Scott: Even if we just didn't even bother in giving a shit at all We you know, it just went out.

382
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:56,257
Scott: whatever.

383
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:59,467
Scott: we still have enough oil for at least a hundred years now.

384
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:00,470
Rym: only an energy theory.

385
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,730
Rym: We're not talking about pollution and all the other bad stuff.

386
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,510
Rym: Say whatever about that, but when it comes to energy utilization, we're probably doing okay.

387
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:10,708
Rym: But that's I don't think that is a valid argument to say we shouldn't.

388
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:17,662
Scott: no no No I'm just saying that we if we just didn't give a shit We could still all our cars and all our factories and everything we have.

389
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:24,588
Scott: we'd still have electricity and the power plants would still be Churning in a hundred years with just the resources that we have available now.

390
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,010
Rym: But space exploration is very much among nerds like us.

391
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,426
Rym: I mean you can't help but watch cosmos or read cosmos at a still more glorious dawn.

392
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:35,580
Rym: a way to just think yeah Yeah, we'll go out to the stars.

393
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,947
Scott: I don't know.

394
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:37,630
Scott: It's not so easy.

395
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:45,940
Rym: I think the analogy is to why I'm actually against any further funding for manned space exploration for the next like 30 or 40 years If not, the next several generations.

396
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:46,624
Rym: is pretty simple.

397
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:47,610
Rym: and I sit now.

398
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:47,972
Rym: I know how.

399
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:50,102
Rym: I brought out my fairly controversial opinion.

400
00:27:50,122 --> 00:27:51,570
Rym: just BAM kind of stuck it in there.

401
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:54,366
Scott: All right, you didn't just BAM sneak it in there by saying BAM.

402
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,058
Scott: I snuck it in there In order to sneak it.

403
00:27:57,078 --> 00:27:58,745
Scott: you have to not say anything it's unsnuck.

404
00:27:58,946 --> 00:27:59,930
Scott: that's like sneaking it.

405
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:08,186
Scott: That's like being completely stealthy sneaking into a museum getting right next to the diamond Taking the diamond off its stand replacing with the fake diamond and going security guards.

406
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:09,110
Scott: Did you totally see that?

407
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,419
Scott: Oh, I don't you see that shit leaders.

408
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:12,543
Rym: I got the real diamond in.

409
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,030
Scott: a fake diamond is in the butt.

410
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,495
Scott: Oh, man, I am the boss.

411
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:18,083
Rym: We have that is called stentorias stealthy.

412
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:19,949
Scott: Oh, it's called upon the third.

413
00:28:21,671 --> 00:28:26,370
Rym: Anyway, I feel this because quite frankly I'll use an analogy from a video game.

414
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:34,989
Rym: let's look at the civilization games right now say I can research pottery and mining and I don't know gunpowder.

415
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,174
Scott: Gunpowder is the winner.

416
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:41,390
Scott: No, because you can just use your gunpowder to take the pottery and mining from the other guy.

417
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:49,110
Rym: All right, so gunpowder is gonna take me a hundred years to research Because you know my current level of science is not that high.

418
00:28:49,674 --> 00:29:06,750
Rym: Pottery is gonna take me a year to research And the benefits of pottery might speed up the bet the the time to get gunpowder Such that if I research all these other things first gunpowder will take less time Even if I add all those other things together then gunpowder with my current technology.

419
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:13,590
Scott: And that's obviously a simple analogy, but a very good lesson from civilization which civilization 5 comes out tomorrow.

420
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:17,170
Scott: Oh shit, that's perhaps today because most people will probably listen to this today.

421
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:18,696
Rym: That is the end of GeekNights you realize.

422
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:19,338
Scott: September 21st 2010.

423
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:20,804
Scott: War was beginning

424
00:29:24,634 --> 00:29:31,597
Rym: But I feel like right now I mean the space race in the Soviet Ute era and Accommodating in us getting on the Russian

425
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:32,180
Scott: space minute

426
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:42,093
Rym: when we landed on the moon in fucking 1969 Which was a long fucking time ago, and we haven't really done anything cool to the masses Except

427
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:43,723
Scott: landing on the moon a bunch more times.

428
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:44,890
Rym: Yeah, but no one cared anymore.

429
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:47,463
Scott: Fucking space stations, holy shit.

430
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:49,854
Rym: actual space stage I know and no one cares.

431
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:55,090
Scott: and that amazing fucking shit robots that fucking work on Mars for real.

432
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:56,650
Rym: Yes, we have pictures of Mars.

433
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:03,530
Rym: I saw he's almost live stream of the Martian atmosphere from the surface and that itself was a while ago.

434
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:16,189
Scott: Oh shit fucking like basically what our metal box robots with not so many moving parts going so far out into space like oh my god Like they're out by Saturn and shit or even farther away Perhaps even out of the solar system.

435
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,301
Rym: Imagine what it really felt like is we didn't even live through that we.

436
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:21,810
Rym: it was so long before we were born.

437
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:35,476
Rym: Imagine the feeling of watching live a dude walking around on the goddamn moon god day next to the goddamn Batman And the fact that most people are not excited about that and don't Marvel at that anytime.

438
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:37,930
Rym: it's brought up kind of sad because it's what have you done for me lately?

439
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,198
Rym: Yeah, and even then what have you done for me though?

440
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:40,640
Rym: You don't see.

441
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:48,250
Scott: you don't see any like, you know Chicago Cubs fans They're not partying because this the World Series they want years ago sent the Chicago Cubs to the moon.

442
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,962
Scott: They won the World Series a hundred years ago.

443
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,089
Scott: You don't see them partying, right?

444
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,070
Scott: That's what have you done for me lately, you know, if it doesn't happen right now, I don't give a shit.

445
00:30:55,331 --> 00:31:03,837
Rym: I think my issue is that the cost to society to continue manned exploration right now is Way more than the benefits were likely to get.

446
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:11,230
Rym: I mean even if we wanted to establish a permanent colony on the moon or on Mars, I don't think manned exploration is the way to go about that quickly.

447
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:15,868
Rym: I think very detailed non-man like 40 years at a rocket scientist.

448
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:16,349
Scott: What do you know?

449
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:19,309
Rym: Well, the rocket scientists all seem to agree, too.

450
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:31,070
Rym: I don't see a lot of people advocating seriously who are in a position to advocate Legitimately that we should be really spending a ton of our resources on manned spaceflight right now.

451
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,629
Scott: Well, I think the thing is is right.

452
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:54,084
Scott: The problem with a lot of spaceflight stuff, especially in the US right is that people care way too much about safety in particular Especially with manned spaceflight, you know and they care about losing money, right if they invest a whole ton of money into something They don't want it to fuck up like has happened many times and they especially don't want people dying Which has also happened more than once.

453
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:57,881
Scott: so Basically, they need to avoid those things at all costs.

454
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:07,090
Scott: and since our space stuff is all Commercial and even if is all government owned and even if when it is commercial, it's still heavily regulated, right?

455
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:14,754
Scott: They're very worried about these things and there's all sorts of limitations and the result is that they need to make these things any Rockets or whatever.

456
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:23,750
Scott: they make them like ninety nine point nine nine nine percent safe And the fact is is a diminishing return in terms of money spent versus safety, right?

457
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:38,336
Scott: I can make a rocket that's ninety percent safe So one out of ten times it'll blow up or whatever But it'll get the job done nine out of ten times and but it'll be like ten percent of the price of that Rocket is ninety nine.

458
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,184
Rym: I mean physics really.

459
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:44,390
Rym: I'm just making numbers up But the point is you know that the famous rocket fuel equation?

460
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:50,490
Rym: Yes, the equation that tells you how much fuel to put in a rocket depends upon how much fuel you put in the rocket.

461
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:52,281
Scott: Yep, that sucks.

462
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:53,529
Scott: It sucks big-time.

463
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,721
Scott: But the thing all right, but it's like okay to make the rocket.

464
00:32:56,821 --> 00:33:00,275
Scott: if let's say the rocket starts out zero percent safe It's gonna kill everybody.

465
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:02,926
Rym: Okay, so it's just a gun.

466
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:03,870
Scott: It's just a bomb.

467
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:05,716
Scott: It's a bomb a rocket.

468
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:06,700
Scott: it's a rocket fuel bomb.

469
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,850
Rym: you just shoot someone to say did it push him into space?

470
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,323
Scott: All right, so I want to make this rocket 10% safe.

471
00:33:11,383 --> 00:33:12,490
Scott: It cost me X dollars.

472
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:14,040
Scott: I want to make it 20% safe.

473
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:15,490
Scott: It cost me like 2x dollars.

474
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,012
Rym: I'm curious.

475
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,789
Rym: What do you imagine the 20% safe rocket looking like one out of five times?

476
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:22,669
Scott: It works and the other four times it blows up.

477
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:26,816
Scott: That simple it's got four.

478
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,502
Scott: it's like it's got a Russian roulette.

479
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:29,345
Scott: How about over?

480
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:30,248
Rym: How about the 1% rocket?

481
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,407
Rym: What kind of fucking rocket actually has a 1% chance?

482
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:42,970
Scott: So it's like a little toy rocket, you know made a cardboard and whatever and the engine which is sort of gimp from the factory.

483
00:33:43,092 --> 00:33:44,070
Scott: So it looks kind of funny.

484
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:51,704
Scott: You don't know if it's gonna go but you push the button and maybe one in a hundred days take a whole bunch of Engines and strap them to some cardboard and put a guy in a chair.

485
00:33:51,724 --> 00:33:55,485
Scott: Yeah, it just it might happen You know, maybe balloons see but at the same.

486
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:56,270
Rym: that's one aspect.

487
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:02,106
Rym: But I think as a society we could easily sidestep that particular issue.

488
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:17,629
Rym: because if you look at I mean if you imagine right now if the the president of the United States came to the American people gave a press conference and said We're looking for volunteers for a mission a manned mission to Mars That will likely not see any of the people on it returning home or even making it to Mars.

489
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:18,452
Scott: No No, I'm not see.

490
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:20,518
Scott: the thing is I'm not even talking about just the man stuff.

491
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:29,370
Scott: obviously that right but if you have a non-manned Thing they still make it crazily safe because a they don't want the rocket hurting anyone who's sitting on the ground.

492
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,197
Rym: I don't think that's as much of a.

493
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,909
Scott: it's not that much of a concern because they're really good at making rockets.

494
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,204
Scott: But be they're worried about losing the really expensive equipment inside right.

495
00:34:38,264 --> 00:34:42,580
Scott: if it blows up with a billion dollars You get in big trouble.

496
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:43,966
Rym: So here's the the.

497
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:44,989
Rym: I think what you're not looking at.

498
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:51,070
Rym: I was only talking about the crazy insane cost of safe manned space flight, which is far more costly.

499
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,429
Rym: But with unmanned stuff.

500
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:55,639
Rym: I'm sure they've already calculated what costs more.

501
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:59,730
Rym: losing five rockets to get one up or sending one up is guaranteed to go up.

502
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,119
Rym: They wouldn't because their lives aren't at stake.

503
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,010
Rym: They wouldn't be doing the more expensive way?

504
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:05,934
Rym: I don't think.

505
00:35:05,974 --> 00:35:06,677
Scott: but that's the thing.

506
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:10,030
Scott: right is this is actually was that SpaceX, right?

507
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:10,672
Scott: I watched they.

508
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:14,510
Scott: they had was a commercial rocket and they launched it and I watched the launch and it totally worked.

509
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:17,210
Scott: It's cheaper than the shit NASA's using.

510
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,810
Rym: Where do you think we launch rockets from are like not not our man stuff, you know the space shuttles.

511
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,874
Rym: What about all those satellites?

512
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:25,243
Rym: We put out pretty fucking cheaply and a lot of them blow up.

513
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:26,166
Scott: Yeah.

514
00:35:26,387 --> 00:35:26,708
Scott: Yeah.

515
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,950
Rym: Yeah Yeah, we've already got that down because there's practical applications of that.

516
00:35:31,752 --> 00:35:32,775
Rym: I just feel like the thing.

517
00:35:32,795 --> 00:35:39,984
Scott: the point is that this is commercial company that made a satellite launching rocket that is cheaper than The ones that NASA is doing.

518
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:41,573
Scott: Yeah They're.

519
00:35:41,654 --> 00:35:43,120
Scott: obviously they're not optimal down.

520
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,421
Scott: They got.

521
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,510
Rym: a lot of our satellite launches are done from outside the US.

522
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:46,849
Scott: Anyway, that's also true.

523
00:35:47,271 --> 00:36:04,410
Rym: I think more really man exploration is the thing because I feel like we gain a lot more benefit from Surveying the space and sending unmanned probes on 20 40 80 year missions then we do by sending a human out there to die Mmm, or not die and just walk around on the moon going I'm on the fucking moon.

524
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,780
Scott: I like the space tourism though, right?

525
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,010
Scott: It's like people want to go to space just so they can go to space.

526
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:09,873
Rym: I think that's fine.

527
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:13,527
Rym: I don't think there's any problem with a commercial endeavor that's willing to risk money and lives.

528
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:18,324
Scott: go for it Right, but the thing is is right is now what if there is that limit on?

529
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:19,810
Scott: we only have one shot to get out there?

530
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,104
Scott: And now you're wasting the precious rocket fuel on people.

531
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:23,170
Scott: I would look around.

532
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:29,063
Rym: Alright, if we're gonna make that argument, I would argue that 90% of what I do in my daily life is similarly wasteful.

533
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:35,822
Rym: I Mean, you know hot the stupid firewire thing is how much electricity that thing's burning?

534
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:38,090
Rym: or those lights when we tried to record that video?

535
00:36:38,972 --> 00:36:40,730
Rym: Again, what's that adding to society?

536
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,268
Scott: something something.

537
00:36:45,232 --> 00:36:48,670
Rym: Yeah, I just I think the sieve analogy really says my opinion best.

538
00:36:48,830 --> 00:37:01,730
Rym: I feel like we should really focus on unmanned and practical space exploration and we should really hold off until technology Reduces the barrier to entry like if say right now it's like 80% of our resources to get to Mars with humans.

539
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:04,519
Rym: But who's to say that in 40 years?

540
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,690
Rym: It won't take 40% of our resources to do the same thing.

541
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:12,590
Rym: I mean think about how hard it was to send a megabyte of data a hundred miles 20 years ago.

542
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:13,874
Scott: Well the other right.

543
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:17,368
Scott: the other issue is that sometimes politics just gets in the way right.

544
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:25,767
Scott: for example There was that They were gonna try to develop that thing where it would go into space and then it would have a whole bunch of fucking nukes to go out into space really fast.

545
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:31,978
Scott: and They basically didn't want to do that because people don't like the idea of nukes even though it's in space and it wouldn't bother them at all.

546
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:41,867
Rym: Or the fact that sometimes presidents of many nations will say things like we're going to put a man on X Because this is a politically expedient thing to do

547
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:41,948
Scott: and

548
00:37:43,471 --> 00:38:03,249
Rym: While it was a probably one of the greatest achievements in human history to actually put people on the moon in 1969 Think what did that get us other than a unifying moment like aside from the social and the kind of visceral feelings What did it really get us that unmanned exploration could not have gotten us at a fraction of the cost?

549
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:11,288
Rym: Mmm and imagine how much cheaper it would have been to try to do that starting today.

550
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:13,638
Rym: if today We were like all right now.

551
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,030
Rym: We're gonna try to go to the goddamn Batman.

552
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:19,409
Scott: Yeah, you wouldn't have had a 10 failed attempts.

553
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:23,019
Rym: It wasn't necessarily 10 failed attempts.

554
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,530
Rym: the Apollo mission was not 10 failures, and then we made it.

555
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:32,789
Rym: It was in a series of steps along the way of course, but the plus Scott Are you forgetting the Gemini program or the Mercury program?

556
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:34,478
Scott: I don't know all the.

557
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:35,810
Rym: you know anything about the space program?

558
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,112
Scott: I do.

559
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:39,670
Scott: I just don't remember every single fucking goddamn mission because it's like a zillion of them.

560
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,473
Scott: There aren't that many.

561
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:41,095
Scott: there's a lot.

562
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:43,926
Rym: You know how many Apollo missions happened in total.

563
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:47,421
Rym: Yeah You know there were at least 13 because there's that movie.

564
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,531
Scott: I know I think there was like 16 or 17.

565
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:50,017
Rym: Oh a Gemini.

566
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:51,069
Rym: Do you know anything about Gemini?

567
00:38:52,712 --> 00:38:54,230
Scott: It's a constellation what?

568
00:38:57,573 --> 00:38:59,190
Rym: Did Gemini have men in it or not?

569
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:02,871
Rym: It Did.

570
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:03,995
Scott: okay it had men.

571
00:39:04,015 --> 00:39:06,104
Scott: that people man's man.

572
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:07,630
Scott: how many men's more than one?

573
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:14,946
Scott: That's why I was called Jim, and I went to space camp as a kid, so that's why you know.

574
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:17,418
Scott: well technically It's not like they teach you the shit in school.

575
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:18,081
Scott: Maybe they should.

576
00:39:18,262 --> 00:39:19,830
Scott: oh they did then teach me in school.

577
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:20,704
Rym: They taught me that in school.

578
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,961
Rym: in fact I remember when I didn't actually go to space camp.

579
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:26,976
Rym: space camp was for kids younger than me Academy so fancy.

580
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:32,987
Rym: if you look anytime you see like videos or TV or movies or anything involving space camp like say the movie space camp.

581
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,774
Rym: Everything they show is actually from space Academy.

582
00:39:37,095 --> 00:39:39,117
Rym: space camp is like lame.

583
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:40,339
Rym: It's like young kids.

584
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,160
Rym: science II can't?

585
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:42,573
Scott: Mm-hmm.

586
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:58,220
Rym: space Academy is what you think is face care, but anyway I remember when I got there and most of the kids already knew most of the stuff like we already knew like all the Gemini missions and Mercury program and the probes and everything and The kids who didn't know were kind of like the kids who got to RIT in the CS program.

587
00:39:58,281 --> 00:39:59,359
Rym: It didn't already know how to code.

588
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:05,040
Rym: Yeah, it was basically like that Usually no good for the record.

589
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:11,980
Rym: I was the mission commander of our simulated mission in like the full space shuttle simulator, and we lost three men.

590
00:40:12,861 --> 00:40:16,314
Rym: Uh-huh we my team barely made it back down alive those ideas.

591
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:19,771
Scott: the thing is usually with space missions You're losing everyone or no one right?

592
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,040
Scott: How did you lose three guys?

593
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,180
Rym: You know how we lost three guys because they were jackass scientists.

594
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:33,840
Rym: So they're they're on the space station and they came back to the space shuttle And we detached and then they had to do some last like mission on the spacewalk crane, right?

595
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,139
Rym: And then come in and I was gonna have him come back down.

596
00:40:36,682 --> 00:40:40,259
Rym: They had already missed their landing window because they were dicking around up there.

597
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:46,697
Rym: So we're already off script and I had to basically order them to just give up on the scientific mission.

598
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:52,520
Rym: come in We're going to do the emergency landing in White Sands because that was the last window they had and then they're gonna.

599
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,793
Rym: You know, they were basically gonna die.

600
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:54,439
Scott: Mm-hmm.

601
00:40:54,741 --> 00:41:00,696
Rym: So they refuse to come back in and their science officer refuses to force them back in.

602
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:02,060
Scott: he was just role-playing or what?

603
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:03,324
Rym: Uh, yeah, I don't.

604
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:10,940
Rym: I honestly the kid was kind of dumb and I don't know why he was the space camp But he refused my order and I couldn't even talk to them directly.

605
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:20,154
Rym: I did you know like in Gundam shows where like the captain says blah blah blah and then like Another person listens to the captain and then tells each department what to do.

606
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:21,720
Rym: I could not talk to them directly.

607
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,832
Rym: I just talked him through the calm.

608
00:41:22,852 --> 00:41:28,940
Rym: Mm-hmm And eventually I gave the order to close the doors on them and prepare for landing there and they died.

609
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:30,205
Rym: They died in space.

610
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:32,696
Rym: We cut them off and we landed and I saved my team.

611
00:41:32,716 --> 00:41:35,973
Scott: Yeah Okay, I guess the only other way like an individual really heated.

612
00:41:36,013 --> 00:41:37,320
Rym: It was actually kind of fucking awesome.

613
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,728
Rym: I guess I had my clipboard and my headphones.

614
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:40,831
Rym: I was yelling.

615
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:42,115
Rym: Oh my god.

616
00:41:42,155 --> 00:41:43,700
Rym: That was a that was a fun fucking moment.

617
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,853
Scott: I guess the only other way like individuals could die in space is they as well.

618
00:41:46,893 --> 00:41:48,500
Scott: if you're on a mission alone, right?

619
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:49,905
Scott: Heart attack.

620
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:56,743
Scott: Yeah, if you get a heart attack much pooping disease Or like you've got a spacewalk and you fuck up right then Yeah You could hurt yourself.

621
00:41:57,105 --> 00:42:00,277
Scott: or if you just you just go open the airlock go out into space on purpose.

622
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:06,060
Rym: someone died Independently in the space station, but they died of an accident on the space station.

623
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:13,359
Scott: I guess like if you're in a space station module and that module blows up but or like he has a hole in it But everyone else is in a different module and it's totally safe.

624
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:15,311
Scott: That can happen in the space station.

625
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:16,900
Rym: a meteorite broke one of the windows.

626
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:22,100
Rym: Yeah, that's exactly that and it depressurize stuff and the crew survived that an escape plan that they they made.

627
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:31,349
Rym: But then when they went back in to fix it One of them did not properly do the airlock and died and then the other one tried to save him and he didn't die But he couldn't save the guy.

628
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:34,030
Scott: Yeah, I guess Really fucking fun.

629
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,540
Rym: So if you're gonna have to do it, you should do it.

630
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,080
Scott: There's plenty I guess there's plenty of opportunities to not kill everyone in space and only to kill a few people.

631
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:40,544
Scott: I guess all.

632
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:43,987
Scott: there's another chance like if the aliens come But then they only get one of you right?

633
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:46,075
Scott: Oh, yeah, cuz Sigourney Weaver totally makes it.

634
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:50,680
Rym: Yeah, but I Swear to God if my people had attempted a landing there.

635
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:58,168
Rym: So, I mean I guess do you agree or disagree?

636
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:04,456
Rym: should we just hold off on manned space exploration until the Diminishing returns is a reverse curve?

637
00:43:04,476 --> 00:43:12,610
Scott: because think about it We're playing sieve right now right as a world and right now space station is we get you know The screen has come up and it's like what would you like to research next?

638
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:16,823
Scott: and it says going into space or Sanitation.

639
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:22,010
Scott: All right and going into space will take a hundred turns or Sanitation two turns.

640
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,359
Scott: which one are you gonna pick?

641
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:30,353
Scott: Because you know if you keep picking the one that takes two turns over and over again Eventually the one that takes a hundred turns will only take two turns.

642
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:31,899
Rym: and that's the situation you get into where.

643
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:34,950
Rym: yes I've got gunpowder and no one else has gunpowder.

644
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:40,054
Rym: My two musket men cannot stand up to the 400 barbarian horsemen.

645
00:43:40,074 --> 00:43:45,620
Scott: Mm-hmm You know also it's like we're we're we're also really close, right?

646
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:57,800
Scott: It's like we're developing all kinds of technologies that will help us out in space like, you know Ways to get oxygen and all that kind of stuff and not have to keep shipping oxygen containers out there or anything like that.

647
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,639
Scott: You know, we can actually make little colonies and whatnot.

648
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:10,635
Scott: And if we I can actually do that then maybe then is the time to go, you know It's like going out there now, you know and testing our really early prototypes.

649
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:15,100
Scott: that sort of thing aren't gonna You know help us as much now.

650
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Rym: A lot of people make the argument that so much great technology came out of the space race.

651
00:44:19,662 --> 00:44:26,430
Rym: That is practical for everyday use but I feel like a lot of those things Could have happened anyway with similar investment into more practical.

652
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:34,080
Scott: Well, the other thing is, you know, we still have a space station already Right, so we can still do plenty of zero gravity experimentation.

653
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,508
Rym: I have a much better argument against that kind of thinking.

654
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:39,173
Rym: Mm-hmm s slash.

655
00:44:39,273 --> 00:44:43,802
Rym: space exploration slash war slash S/g.

656
00:44:44,183 --> 00:44:47,612
Rym: Yeah, I guess I put an extra s in there, but you get my point.

657
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:51,160
Rym: Yeah war gives us so much practical technology.

658
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,320
Rym: Should we spend more money on war or should we spend money on developing technology?

659
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,892
Scott: Yeah, I mean cuz think about the kind of technologies that war makes right.

660
00:44:59,952 --> 00:45:02,260
Scott: think about what those are and there are many of them.

661
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:03,508
Scott: Not all of them are bad.

662
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,240
Rym: a lot of them are practical or everyday.

663
00:45:05,381 --> 00:45:23,902
Scott: But think about the kind of technologies that we've made recently that have nothing to do with war like, you know Had something to do with war yeah, but not mobile phones really as much you know, or you know Facebook Podcasts,

664
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:26,575
Rym: so I wonder how much of a contrary opinion we're taking.

665
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:27,500
Rym: I want what do you guys think?

666
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,284
Rym: Maybe I'll make a little poll in the thread about this episode Mm-hmm, and then we can have further discussion based on that.

667
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:34,046
Scott: Sounds good.

668
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:43,000
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

669
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,780
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

670
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:50,088
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

671
00:45:50,128 --> 00:45:53,120
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

672
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:00,440
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays and a comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

673

674
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:10,356
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows.

675
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,780
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
