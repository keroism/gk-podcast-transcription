1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,785
Rym: It's Wednesday October 20th.

2
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:11,487
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:16,180
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight the scary flying ghost ship.

4
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:24,233
Scott: It's not scary Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:37,987
Rym: I remember a time at RIT when the only way I would get to play DDR Was when the anime club would be like hey, we're playing DDR, and they'd set it up at like this club space.

6
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,952
Scott: That was the year Mm.

7
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,440
Rym: We've been playing DDR for a decade.

8
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:47,030
Rym: yep, and I still can't beat some of those nine-footers.

9
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:48,716
Scott: It's cuz.

10
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:49,829
Scott: you've been playing DDR for a decade.

11
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:55,444
Rym: Yeah, I think it's sad, but I feel like I might have.

12
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:57,510
Rym: finally for the first time like you know we're getting old.

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,920
Rym: I'm pushing 30, and it bothers me, but at the same time.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:10,785
Rym: I haven't felt the effects of age too much yet until this past week Because I've been playing DDR a lot lately just for various replaying DDR without caffeine.

15
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:14,789
Rym: oh, yeah Except even with caffeine I couldn't do it.

16
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:21,290
Rym: But my trouble is I'm playing DDR And I decided I'm going to get to the next level the level I never reached in the old days.

17
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:24,889
Rym: I want to be able to pass every nine-footer the same way I can pass every eight-footer.

18
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,196
Rym: I'm about three-quarters.

19
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:30,090
Scott: the way there that nine foot is a lot bigger than the eighth foot.

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,758
Scott: Yeah, but you know all feet are equal.

21
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,050
Rym: I can pass almost every nine-footer.

22
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,853
Rym: That's not my trouble.

23
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:41,117
Rym: my trouble is that then I thought so there's those ten-foot fuckers like max 300 and legend of max.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,443
Rym: you know all that stuff.

25
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:46,138
Rym: the crazy challenge to the So I was practicing.

26
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,625
Rym: I've been practicing max 300 for two weeks now.

27
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:54,350
Rym: Just now Scott saw I got within three seconds of beating it on maniac.

28
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:56,622
Scott: It's bully and you had to beat it or you don't?

29
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,013
Rym: yeah, but at the same time I'm getting there.

30
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:11,390
Scott: see what I think they should have done right in DDR is instead of using this foot system of Difficulty they should rank every DDR song ever with a number of how hard it is and change them as new songs.

31
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,534
Scott: I see I would agree.

32
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,961
Scott: This is the number one hardest song.

33
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:21,436
Rym: Here's why I disagree because some stuff like a rhythm in police and I don't know they love you like a fool.

34
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:27,116
Rym: our two are similarly difficult songs that are very different in the manner that they're Difficult like.

35
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:28,688
Rym: I can do songs with a lot of streaming.

36
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,330
Scott: yeah But whatever you just pick whatever number you just rank them next to each other and then people can argue about it.

37
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:34,394
Scott: It doesn't matter.

38
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:35,659
Scott: What do you care if you're konami?

39
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:36,301
Scott: It'll give a shit?

40
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,770
Scott: Yeah, right, so you just but they had a good system.

41
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:39,880
Rym: I mean I like the foot system.

42
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:41,010
Rym: I like that web graph.

43
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,430
Rym: They added remember where it shows like why it's difficult like this is a jumpy song.

44
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,794
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

45
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,102
Scott: anyway people playing don't even pay attention to that.

46
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,427
Rym: Yeah, they do replay.

47
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:51,410
Rym: We paid attention to it a lot.

48
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:51,772
Rym: I remember.

49
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,903
Scott: normal people do not even know.

50
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:54,728
Rym: people don't play DDR.

51
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:55,853
Scott: Yeah, they do.

52
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:58,724
Rym: DDR is dead except among hardcore fans.

53
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:00,430
Scott: hardcore people don't need the little chart.

54
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:02,177
Rym: I would say we're hardcore.

55
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:05,530
Rym: no there are people who are just hardest core whatever anyway.

56
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:07,638
Rym: So I can almost pass it.

57
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:15,150
Rym: so I've been playing you know legend of max and max unlimited And I reached a point that I never thought I'd reach in my life.

58
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,972
Rym: I just I knew it.

59
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:20,607
Rym: you know kind of intellectually, but I never viscerally really believed it until now.

60
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:22,976
Rym: I Know the arrows.

61
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:25,145
Rym: I know exactly what I need to do.

62
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:26,170
Rym: I see them come in.

63
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,113
Rym: I think you know like.

64
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:28,516
Rym: I know it.

65
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:33,530
Rym: I know it perfectly and I literally just can't move my legs fast enough to execute it.

66
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:35,298
Scott: Yeah, it's that's how it is.

67
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,470
Rym: I've never run into something like that in my life before.

68
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:39,254
Rym: This is this is it.

69
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:48,610
Scott: I'll go run like the New York Marathon, and it'll be like uh yeah You didn't realize it is that many miles all at once, but I feel like I could train for that.

70
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:51,676
Rym: I feel like with this in particular I just there will.

71
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:54,064
Rym: there is a physical limitation that I have hit that.

72
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:57,949
Rym: had I attempted this when I was younger I probably would have been able to pass it.

73
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:02,550
Scott: I do not know if I'm yeah, because you know why you're able to do when you're younger tiny legs.

74
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:05,380
Scott: We have big legs which are younger.

75
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,810
Rym: I'm talking like when I was at RIT.

76
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,820
Rym: I'm not bigger now than I was then.

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,402
Scott: there you are.

78
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:11,890
Rym: I'm not bigger.

79
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:15,083
Scott: I stopped growing like well you're definitely not bigger than me.

80
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:16,690
Rym: That's like senior year of high school.

81
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:20,934
Rym: I didn't get any taller after that I Mean.

82
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:24,570
Scott: I think that's why the Japanese people are so good at DDR because they're like they are so tiny.

83
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,949
Rym: How do you explain fanboy in the mall?

84
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:32,140
Rym: He is fat Doing the fanboy piston.

85
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:36,409
Scott: yeah, so when he steps It doesn't push his body up because his body is weighing his leg down.

86
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:42,670
Scott: We bounce which makes it harder to hit another arrow again because your foot is farther away from it because it bounced.

87
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:46,796
Rym: Anyway before we get into the one I guess anime news I do want to mention this briefly.

88
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:50,189
Rym: Deno coil an anime that is highly acclaimed that I haven't seen yet either.

89
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,850
Scott: Scott I downloaded the whole thing by doing well.

90
00:04:51,870 --> 00:05:02,189
Rym: I only watch like episode one Alex and Emily and everyone watching these legitimately released I don't know, but it's supposedly awesome all right, and it's about augmented reality and gaming and that sort of thing.

91
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:04,276
Scott: It's I think we have that now.

92
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,445
Scott: wasn't there penny arcade comic with the Invisibles.

93
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,670
Scott: Yeah, that's Deno coil.

94
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:09,577
Rym: So here's the problem.

95
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,223
Rym: then I keep saying here's the problem.

96
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:15,378
Rym: then our coil is gonna get a video game And it's gonna be made by game on.

97
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:24,070
Rym: and I bring this up only because this is one of those situations Much much like our egregiously unrealized potential panel at PAX where we asked why there's no Pokemon MMO.

98
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:30,190
Rym: This is a game world and a concept that could be an amazing game And I'll bet you any money.

99
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,968
Rym: It is going to be a generic shit MMO or even worse like hexide a generic shit fake MMO.

100
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:36,951
Scott: Yes, sir I was giving.

101
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,078
Rym: yeah, that's all I got.

102
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:42,710
Rym: that's it so much more important the New York anime festival, New York comic-con.

103
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:49,950
Scott: I know it was already like two weeks ago, but we haven't done a Wednesday episode So we haven't done any posts reviewing talk about it.

104
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:54,916
Rym: I talked about it a little bit on the gaming episode because yeah We talked about burning.

105
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,890
Scott: can we talked about the gaming aspects of it?

106
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,430
Scott: But we didn't really talk about all the stuff that went on there, so we should just do it briefly.

107
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:04,021
Scott: You know some of the stuff we saw there good and bad and whatever.

108
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:09,743
Rym: well the New York comic-con New York anime festival the double Double mega con had one thing going for it.

109
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:11,330
Rym: there were a lot of goddamn people there.

110
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:16,726
Scott: Yeah, I only went on Friday, but supposedly Saturday was insane in terms of the number of people.

111
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:18,050
Rym: Saturday was completely sold out.

112
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,938
Rym: There's no way to get in if you didn't already have a badge.

113
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,344
Scott: Yeah, they're reported.

114
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:24,435
Scott: turnstile figure is 96,000 ish.

115
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:29,270
Scott: so the thing is a lot of people get the one-day badge especially Saturday and Sunday.

116
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,784
Scott: So I'm thinking real numbers probably in the 50 to 60 thousand area.

117
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:35,268
Rym: I'd top it at around 70.

118
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:35,770
Rym: That's my guess.

119
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:38,850
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is Sunday there was a line.

120
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,590
Scott: You know I only went Sunday, and then Sunday's kids day, so everyone brings their kids on Sunday.

121
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:44,741
Rym: No, here's the scary thing.

122
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:45,610
Rym: it wasn't just kids.

123
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,623
Rym: So I'm walking around and the con is still crazy crazy crowded.

124
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:58,543
Rym: and when I go to leave I said I've the whole kind of seen this gigantic line like snaking all around the inside and then going out a door and then snaking All around the outside of the Javits.

125
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:04,628
Rym: so on the way out I'm looking I'm like what the fuck is this line for and I asked someone and they're like I'm just trying to get in.

126
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:09,890
Rym: Every one of those people was trying to buy a one-day badge to get in and they were trying to buy it at the door.

127
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,440
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is they were also will call everyone's in the same line.

128
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:14,604
Scott: Whoa will call?

129
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:16,549
Scott: so the non will call line was short.

130
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,037
Rym: They were all one as far as I could tell.

131
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,086
Rym: okay, but the trouble was the trouble.

132
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:23,190
Rym: I keep saying that I don't know why.

133
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,523
Rym: Suffice it you got you got trouble.

134
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,087
Rym: I got trouble.

135
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:37,049
Rym: indeed The line was crazy and only about half the people in the line had kids with them and the kid Presence on Sunday did not seem substantially greater than the kid presence on Friday night.

136
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:45,974
Scott: Yeah, for I was only there Friday and because I went in like an hour early I could have gone in it like 10, but I went in it like noon and It wasn't.

137
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,160
Scott: you know, it wasn't early.

138
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,202
Scott: It was in during the professional hours So I was able to see everything without a lot of traffic.

139
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:57,210
Scott: and then you know I stayed there all day Friday and it never got you know, intolerably crowded on Friday.

140
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:10,194
Rym: I'm curious if you had this problem on Friday because I had it Friday evening and I had it times 10 on Sunday and Emily And you know a bunch of our friends went on Saturday and they had this problem times a thousand Buckers just bump into you.

141
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,963
Scott: No, my problem was people.

142
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:15,050
Scott: just you know, stop it in the in the aisles.

143
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:16,830
Scott: You know a little bit on Friday, right?

144
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:24,109
Scott: You'd walk down an aisle and it's like I want to move and this room on the other side There's like two people in front of me and then there's space to move.

145
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:39,080
Scott: But there's people to the left looking at something people to the right looking at something and people in the middle just standing still And it's like you people in the middle Move to the other side of these two blobs and then there's empty space just beyond you where I would like to go You know and it's like just keep walking.

146
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:39,663
Rym: simple fix.

147
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:41,070
Rym: it would take minimal staff.

148
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,690
Rym: All I would do if I you know ran the double mega con is have directions.

149
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:48,123
Scott: I would also one way.

150
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:49,330
Rym: every aisle is one way.

151
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,277
Scott: Yes, every aisle should be one way.

152
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:54,990
Scott: and also I would just ban picture-taking in aisles.

153
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:57,970
Scott: It's like there is the picture-taking of cosplayer area.

154
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,369
Scott: You may not take pictures of cosplayers anywhere else and risk camera confiscation.

155
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:05,829
Rym: Scott It's too hard to ban and there's no way you'd have enough staff to actually enforce that it.

156
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:07,255
Scott: no But the thing is you don't.

157
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,524
Scott: what you had to do is it's the same kind of thing.

158
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:10,990
Scott: You don't enforce all of it, right?

159
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:15,505
Scott: If a staff guys there, you know, no one's gonna risk it now.

160
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:16,348
Rym: No one's gonna even know.

161
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:16,970
Rym: no one'll even know.

162
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,433
Rym: It's a rule.

163
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,590
Rym: no one reads anything in the con book except the schedule.

164
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,134
Scott: That's their problem.

165
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:22,964
Rym: No, I think that's a terrible way to go.

166
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:23,990
Scott: I think it's a great rule.

167
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:28,589
Scott: I think that's 99% of the traffic and aisles is stopping to take pictures.

168
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,510
Rym: Scott Maybe because you went on Friday when it was less on Saturday and Sunday.

169
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,530
Rym: The problem was there's just too many people trying to walk in both directions.

170
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:39,390
Scott: It was just a solid sea of people apparently at no point did the fire marshal think it was a problem.

171
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,525
Scott: Yeah, he's watching the whole time because they had a cap.

172
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,934
Rym: Uh-huh The trouble is just.

173
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:45,659
Rym: they really need one-way lanes.

174
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,906
Rym: that would probably solve most of the overcrowding.

175
00:09:48,388 --> 00:10:02,430
Rym: and then beyond that It's just a. I feel like comic cons have this problem where anime and gaming cons don't so much of people just bumping into you Not like you know Squeezing by or crowded like Otakon crazy crowded in that upper skywalk and trying to get across.

176
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:04,315
Rym: You're like the 300 level going.

177
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,201
Rym: Yeah, but no one.

178
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:12,200
Rym: just like slams into me full-on at Otakon Or anime Boston or packs or anything.

179
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:18,910
Rym: yet at this con that dudes not just fat dudes But they were the biggest offenders would literally just like bang into me while I was walking.

180
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,116
Scott: I think I only got bumped once.

181
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,342
Rym: I got back course.

182
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:25,921
Rym: you bang some people with those goddamn Boxes you had to pick up and then I had to carry to the stupid cab.

183
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:28,048
Scott: Hey, but I got fancy boxes now.

184
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,890
Scott: So yeah So it could have been a lot more inconvenient.

185
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:41,110
Rym: Yeah, I show up at the con you're like, oh wait We got to go get a dolly and get these heavy fucking gigantic boxes and carry them around the con And then get a cab at the Javits at night when there's no way to get a cab.

186
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,957
Scott: It wasn't that bad.

187
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,586
Rym: It's like 20 minutes to get a cab.

188
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:47,212
Scott: That's fun Would you?

189
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:47,755
Scott: okay?

190
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:50,166
Scott: would you rather pay the shipping for the for the boxes?

191
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:50,970
Rym: They're not my boxes.

192
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,829
Rym: So yes, I would rather you have paid the shipping for the boxes since that stuff.

193
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:58,161
Rym: Then you try to dump them a cat's artist alley table.

194
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:00,190
Rym: They're bigger than the space behind her table.

195
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:01,895
Scott: Yeah, they would fit back there.

196
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:05,566
Rym: Anyway, nevermind trying to squeeze them past the fat dudes to get to her table.

197
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:06,148
Scott: That's all right.

198
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,990
Scott: So What about you know, regardless of that situation, right?

199
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,200
Scott: What kind of you see any cool stuff at the?

200
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,370
Scott: I mean because it was mostly booths, right?

201
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:23,103
Scott: it's one of those cons where you see every booth and Unless there's a specific programming you really want to see or a specific famous person You really want to meet right then?

202
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:28,592
Scott: You see all the boobs and you leave and most of the famous people you want to see are like sitting at an artist alley Table.

203
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:29,980
Scott: so it's sort of a mocha situation.

204
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,977
Scott: You don't have to go to their panel, right or There they have.

205
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:37,430
Scott: you have to pay to get an autograph with them So you don't see them or you look at them from far away and go there's a famous person.

206
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:50,065
Rym: All right Honestly, the only thing that drew my attention that was really like stood out that I remember and really enjoyed was Other than checking out a couple of specific booths for like, you know publishers I know was all the models of Gundams in the middle.

207
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:51,430
Scott: Well, that was the Bandai booth.

208
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,824
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely by far the best booth.

209
00:11:54,428 --> 00:12:02,376
Rym: Oh my god The Bandai booth was made a win and there's stuff like that at like that sort of model kind of stuff at PAX in the Crazy expo hall but not to that scale.

210
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:11,475
Scott: This is the one and I had every single current model built and on display well presented in these glass cases and It was pretty awesome.

211
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:15,829
Scott: If you are a fan of plastic robots, it was like the greatest thing I ever saw.

212
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,403
Scott: Yeah terms of plastic robots and I bought the best one that they had.

213
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,390
Rym: Otherwise, I just walked around the whole place.

214
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:23,290
Rym: I have mostly impressions about the con in general.

215
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,338
Rym: I'm trying to avoid all the meta that no one cares about.

216
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:33,090
Scott: just some stuff that I saw that was interesting right was There was a the hendane, you know, doujinshi people.

217
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:37,782
Scott: Oh, yeah They were up against the wall facing the wall in the back backity back back.

218
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:40,670
Rym: cannot but hope that that was intentional.

219
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:41,794
Scott: Yeah, there was.

220
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:44,182
Rym: I saw a lot of fucking yaoi panels though.

221
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:45,005
Rym: Yeah, we panels.

222
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:45,768
Rym: Yeah, we paddles.

223
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:48,838
Scott: Yeah Yeah, cuz they were actually letting him sell them.

224
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:56,609
Scott: those big heavy boxes that I bought were actually the comic cubes Which are like these it's like, you know, you buy comic books and you put them in a cardboard box.

225
00:12:57,192 --> 00:13:01,310
Scott: But this is basically the same thing only it's actually nice furniture.

226
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:05,130
Scott: So you can put it out with the furniture and it's super nice and it was totally worth it.

227
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:08,083
Scott: And it let me make room in the closet for the vacuum cleaner.

228
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:08,304
Rym: Yep.

229
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:09,610
Rym: All you need now is the hoplite.

230
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:12,961
Scott: Yeah animal planet had a really fancy booth.

231
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:14,506
Scott: what I don't know.

232
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:15,430
Scott: what they were doing there.

233
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,242
Rym: Why is animal planet the network of ghosts and midgets?

234
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,490
Rym: There are no animals on the animal planet except things like yetis.

235
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,049
Scott: Maybe ghost yetis, I don't know.

236
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,996
Rym: And even there you know what they were promoting.

237
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,790
Rym: they were promoting some like I don't know paleo zoology.

238
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,586
Rym: Let's go find like cryptids and yetis and crap.

239
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:37,270
Rym: Yeah That's what they were actually promoting.

240
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,300
Scott: Sengoku Basara, that's the show with the horses that have mufflers.

241
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,067
Scott: Yeah, I had some really good promotion.

242
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:45,545
Rym: basically, you know They're psycho mufflers not you know muffler mufflers.

243
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,230
Scott: Yeah, you know how Samurais wear flag on their back.

244
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:48,712
Scott: They were set.

245
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:52,070
Scott: they were giving out these Sengoku Basara flags for people to wear on their back.

246
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:56,550
Rym: Realize if you know the e-commerce is coming along after the legal stuff is sorted out.

247
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,575
Rym: Do you guys want like?

248
00:13:57,997 --> 00:14:00,630
Rym: I don't know if anyone would really want this but I want to make some of those.

249
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:02,123
Scott: That's all you.

250
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:13,459
Scott: They had these two shamisen playing dudes who were not the Yoshida brothers But I went to see them just by chance like I kind of wanted to see them and I just happened to stay Arrive at their panel room.

251
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,130
Rym: I really wanted to see him but I was at work.

252
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,882
Scott: They were way awesome and they totally played smoke on the water on the shamisen.

253
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,166
Scott: It was wicked crazy.

254
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,270
Rym: Really like shamisen.

255
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:24,302
Scott: Alright, uh, they're gonna be at Carnegie Hall in March.

256
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:24,703
Scott: We can go.

257
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:26,430
Rym: Oh, yeah, I think you mentioned that before.

258
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,096
Rym: We should get some tickets.

259
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:28,830
Scott: Yeah, there was a guy cosplaying.

260
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,820
Scott: I don't know if he was cosplaying or if he was.

261
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,130
Scott: you know a company paid for it to happen But he was the high chew King and he was giving out high chew.

262
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:41,090
Rym: Actually, I saw a perfect Zangief, but I realized college humor was probably there.

263
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:44,160
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was the dude who played Zangief in the later years.

264
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,782
Scott: You think so?

265
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:48,514
Rym: You look exactly like that guy maybe Exactly.

266
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,430
Rym: I was gonna talk to him, but I was actually in a hurry.

267
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:56,950
Scott: I Went to Vamps panel, which I realized I learned a few things in this Vamps panel, right?

268
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:09,030
Scott: basically, they had this guy come out who sort of worked with them in the US and He basically killed time and bullshitted for the vast majority of the panel Meaning that they only had to actually do their panel for a very short amount of time.

269
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,341
Rym: We should hire someone to do that for us.

270
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:23,546
Scott: Like imagine there's a panel It's our panel and then for the first 45 minutes some guy comes out in bullshits and then the cosplay Come out and answer questions very slowly for 15 minutes and then we leave.

271
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:29,056
Scott: and that was you know I asked them if they ate crab Any to know that.

272
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:31,124
Scott: I actually you know that I everyone laughed.

273
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:32,933
Scott: but then I asked them what you know They're.

274
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,026
Scott: the best meal they had was and one guy he ate.

275
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,002
Scott: I forget what the one guy ate but the other guy had like a bagel.

276
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:40,366
Scott: He thought was really good New York bagel That works Yeah.

277
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:41,876
Scott: And then we went to the.

278
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:47,339
Scott: the big thing was right before our panel was the Hatsune Miku panel With the guys from Krypton future media.

279
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,910
Rym: now as always whenever I go to a panel like this Usually the people presenting it even it packs like big game people.

280
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:58,127
Rym: They really know their stuff and they're important people, but they're really bad at presenting presenting skills.

281
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:58,990
Rym: Not the grade.

282
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:05,010
Scott: They basically just read off their PowerPoints, which was pretty sad, but the information they presented was pretty top-notch.

283
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,490
Scott: Yeah, they gave us all this stuff.

284
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:14,283
Scott: We learned about all this shit and I have it pretty much come to the conclusion That these guys the only guys in Japan that I know of so far

285
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:17,212
Rym: other than maybe project X cup noodle Yeah

286
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:21,408
Scott: that knows what the fuck is up in terms of like business models for the 21st.

287
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,753
Scott: but here's why.

288
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,596
Rym: here's why thank.

289
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:27,752
Scott: the whole world can learn from these guys and the reason is is because they're Programmers.

290
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,359
Rym: I was about to say they're technologists.

291
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,257
Scott: They know that they said open source like 20 times During their panel because they know.

292
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,670
Rym: anyone who knows technology kind of has these obvious things.

293
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,349
Rym: The only difference is they decided to actually pursue a business.

294
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,935
Scott: Yeah Look the number.

295
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:43,763
Scott: this guy was in charge of the company.

296
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:44,768
Scott: number one guy.

297
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:48,840
Scott: number one President founder of Krypton future media and he was a programmer.

298
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,163
Scott: He was he wasn't a businessman.

299
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:52,610
Scott: He wasn't an animator not a businessman.

300
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:58,230
Scott: He wasn't entrenched in any old ways, you know And he understands open source and Linux and everything.

301
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:05,030
Scott: And if you look this is why even you know, their Hatsune Miku character is so open source, right?

302
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,409
Scott: They know what's up.

303
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:19,960
Scott: They understand creative commons and free culture and that is why they are kicking everyone's ass so hard right, and they don't even have an anime or a manga Reno really and You know, meanwhile, they're just completely dominating.

304
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,530
Scott: You know Miku is like taking over the whole world.

305
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:29,874
Rym: Yeah there were like seven Hatsune Miku cosplayers at the panel and then a whole bunch more people cosplaying as other characters from the program

306
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:36,679
Scott: and the panel was packed and they presented a whole bunch of really impressive statistics and You know, I could go on and on and on but they were.

307
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:39,894
Scott: they were awesome dudes and I asked him what the first computer He had was.

308
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:41,787
Scott: it was like an Apple LC 2 or whatever.

309
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:46,590
Rym: Yeah What made me really happy though was that it seemed like the interest in the panel.

310
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,307
Rym: Like I was worried that people showing up the panel were gonna be fangirls caring about.

311
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,950
Rym: you know The the videos people have made or the music or the character.

312
00:17:54,492 --> 00:18:06,712
Rym: But most of the people in the panel seemed primarily interested in getting a hold of the program in English and making stuff Yeah, and I think it bodes well for the future because what is it that we think makes gaming cons so much better than anime Cons?

313
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:11,173
Rym: by and large the creator culture or at least the participate Participatory culture?

314
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:15,369
Scott: the thing is the anime and comic cons of the artists alley and the gaming cons do not have that.

315
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:16,510
Scott: You know.

316
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:22,570
Scott: They don't have the the anime cons of the physic the physical space for that culture to live and the gaming cons don't.

317
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:24,502
Rym: Every time I talk to keel I'm like.

318
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,956
Rym: so we're gonna get an artist Elliot packs We're gonna get an artist Elliot packs.

319
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:27,198

Scott: Yeah, right We'll see.

324
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:32,404
Scott: I think you'd need to talk to Dave though to get that one.

325
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:33,690
Scott: Yeah, what's his name?

326
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,052

00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:42,657
Rym: that thing we did That we did.

329
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:44,549
Rym: that was bad that we may not ever do again.

330
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:46,997
Rym: We do it again.

331
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,886
Rym: It'll be like a moth turning into a butterfly.

332
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:52,596
Rym: No, a better moth.

333
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:53,319
Scott: Whatever.

334
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,461
Rym: Anyway, so after that we did our panel which Was a panel.

335
00:18:57,562 --> 00:19:01,310
Rym: it was not the pan I want to talk about it though because we didn't plan to do that panel.

336
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:02,174
Rym: We were gonna.

337
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:11,670
Rym: we had all these other panel plans and then as the con got more and more Commercial and they brought more and more professionals doing their kind of you know I'm a professional who doesn't know how to present were very well panels.

338
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:19,418
Rym: We cut it down to just one and then the one panel he wanted us to do was not even one I offered Yeah, I gave you.

339
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:19,962
Rym: I had this list of.

340
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:22,777
Rym: alright if we just want to do one Here are the three like awesome ones.

341
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:25,490
Rym: pick one and they're like, why don't you do this one anime?

342
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,495
Rym: You never thought you'd like.

343
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:30,956
Rym: and I'm like, that's actually a two-hour screening That's not really a panel.

344
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,905
Rym: and they were like, can you do a panel called that?

345
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:37,450
Rym: and I was like, yeah I can do that and we threw it together and it was really popular.

346
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,093
Rym: It was anime.

347
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,264
Scott: You should see with a slightly different list of anime.

348
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:40,787
Rym: Actually.

349
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:48,190
Rym: It was about 75% different anime and we approached it from a side with a different list of anime, but we presented slightly different.

350
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,629
Scott: We presented it in the same manner.

351
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:51,414
Rym: Sort of we did.

352
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:52,942
Rym: at least this was a panel.

353
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,690
Rym: That was nothing more than an excuse to show.

354
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:56,817
Scott: No, we always have the show.

355
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:57,179
Scott: Oh, no.

356
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,673
Rym: No, I feel like we should show that in every panel We ever do.

357
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:04,210
Scott: it was great because I'm like, I'm gonna show Oh No But I saw it like the fifth row on the right.

358
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,010
Scott: There was like a lady with her kids and the kids looked like they were six or eight.

359
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,150
Scott: Yeah, and I'm like, I'm gonna show Oh No, and I'm like, well this is the North Star is for eight-year-olds in Japan.

360
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:18,163
Scott: Yep, and I was looking at the same woman the whole time I was like and then she and then when Oh No happened she was laughing.

361
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,110
Scott: I was like the mom was like hysterical.

362
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,095
Scott: I was like, that's right.

363
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:27,765
Scott: You can't withhold the power of the Oh No I'm glad we're on the same wavelength because those on kite can defeats all.

364
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:35,073
Rym: because when we were doing the panel I said fuck just in the course of doing the panel and I immediately realized wait a minute and I noticed them and I was Like, oh, all right.

365
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:39,690
Rym: I got a how we gonna do this and I'm glad that we at least had the same secret concern.

366
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,785
Scott: Yeah, I always have that slight concern.

367
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:47,620
Scott: Not that You know, not that I care about offending anyone depends.

368
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:48,423
Scott: I just don't want.

369
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:50,290
Scott: I just don't want them to complain to the convention.

370
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:51,655
Rym: No, it depends on the con.

371
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:55,789
Rym: I mean remember when someone complained about our rape glorification.

372
00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:01,961
Scott: exactly It's like I don't care about if I if I actually do a rape glorification panel I just don't want someone to complain to the convention about me.

373
00:21:02,022 --> 00:21:07,442
Rym: I kind of do because that gets attention Negative yeah, but you know this depends on the con like packs.

374
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:10,794
Rym: if someone complained about us swearing at a panel What do you think?

375
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:17,750
Scott: He'll is gonna say he's gonna say what they swear at the Q&A What the fuck is what he's gonna say.

376
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:30,090
Rym: But the cool thing was hardly anyone at the panel knew who we were which meant there are people who are still fans of anime Even though I think the majority of the people at this con were comic or Hollywood fans and they were not anime fans.

377
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:33,044
Scott: Someone wrote a great article that they put up today on their blog.

378
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,671
Scott: Maybe I'll get the link for it right.

379
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:49,950
Scott: pretty much talking about the anime ghetto right and I was sort of 50/50 on it is the one thing is The con had the big expo Hall area and in the expo Hall area was all the dealers of and all the exhibitors Right, but they were segregated.

380
00:21:50,090 --> 00:22:03,310
Scott: so like in the back right corner was selling plastic toys in like the pop cult zone and in the front right area was all The guys selling old dusty comic books and in the front left was all like the big boos from big companies.

381
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:08,017
Rym: They made it way too easy to just go to the parts You cared about and not see random.

382
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:16,886
Scott: in the middle was like the comic publishers that you know Weren't Marvel in DC and in the you know And all the anime people were in sort of the middle right in the back.

383
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:17,710
Rym: I wouldn't mix it up.

384
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:25,809
Rym: I would have been like guy with a rage spider-man guy with swords guy with yeah I mean sci-fi continuum was actually in the middle left sort of on its own.

385
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:30,819
Scott: there I was like, yes, I have a continuum good spot Selling good stuff best dealer at every anime.

386
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,230
Scott: con can't lose course part of the trouble about some lone wolf and cub volumes.

387
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,160
Rym: What anime dealers are there that are left?

388
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,223
Rym: I mean all the anime stuff.

389
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:40,190
Scott: that was anime castle anime pavilion.

390
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,684
Rym: What they're selling?

391
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:58,250
Rym: they're selling the same The same job is or or they've got Mangas I say cheap DVDs because the DVDs No one in the dealer's room could beat Amazon by even within not even the six dollar DVD booth.

392
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,137
Rym: Are you kidding the six dollar DVD booth?

393
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:07,770
Scott: I found some of the stuff for like two bucks on Amazon, but they had like He had like Ghostbusters one and two together for six bucks.

394
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:09,215
Rym: Yeah, I already own that.

395
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:12,448
Scott: and they had like all of She-Ra all of it six bucks.

396
00:23:12,468 --> 00:23:16,462
Rym: All right I'll clarify there were some good deals on non anime.

397
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:20,307
Scott: Okay, but anime, okay They didn't have any anime at the six dollar DVD booth.

398
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,059
Rym: Yeah, there was no anime.

399
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:28,710
Scott: and that con as far as I could tell that was Continuum had there, you know, you can get all of Pat LeVoir for like, you know, 60 bucks total.

400
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,583
Rym: That's like three separate boxes and look how much it is online.

401
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:33,090
Scott: Oh, yeah about the same.

402
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:37,390
Rym: I was walking around with my smartphone for like an hour and I couldn't find a single deal anyway.

403
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:41,284
Scott: And then they had like it because there was construction going on at the Javits.

404
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:42,810
Scott: So that was the expo area.

405
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,875
Scott: Then they had another area.

406
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:51,586
Scott: That was the comic artists alley the sort of You know exhibitors that aren't really exhibitors like the podcasters and some other folks.

407
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,873
Rym: or I guess Tally was cool But a little sad.

408
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:58,027
Scott: Yeah, then there was like a variant stage which is just the annoying stage.

409
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:06,210
Rym: Oh my god Did not want to be anywhere near that thing, you know Jedis and that sort of shit they had that by the by the maid cafe.

410
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,859
Scott: No, that was not the very no.

411
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,850
Scott: I'm saying that was the maid stay.

412
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,700
Rym: I know what I'm saying is in the maid cafe.

413
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,807
Rym: There was another stage just like that.

414
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:16,655
Scott: That was just no It wasn't just like.

415
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:17,579
Scott: it was completely different.

416
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,950
Scott: In fact, they're annoying people yelling on it.

417
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:30,119
Scott: Okay, the variant stage has a schedule right and there's actually the groups that are on the variant stage Scheduled to be on there like, you know The Mario Bueno guy and the Jedi's and all those people.

418
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:33,169
Scott: the maid stage is just whatever the fuck.

419
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,750
Scott: I think you can just go up there and sing and do whatever you want every time.

420
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:37,854
Scott: Schedule for it.

421
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:40,243
Rym: There were the same people running game shows up there.

422
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:41,930
Scott: Yeah, they just decided to do that.

423
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,065
Rym: So what I'm saying is they were equal from a from a fan perspective walking around the con.

424
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:49,878
Rym: they were equally annoying Mainly because they were way too loud.

425
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:57,230
Scott: Yeah, and the thing was is I think that the impressions Is that is that people think that these stages are popular and that's why they keep them.

426
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,646
Scott: But the fact is people are sitting near these stages because that's the only place this.

427
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:01,470
Scott: tables and chairs.

428
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:10,461
Rym: Yep if you know if you had tables and chairs away from all this sad moment in the anime ghetto where someone's trying to work up The crowd and literally no one there is saying anything.

429
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:13,110
Rym: They're like facing away like sitting at their table reading comics.

430
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:17,493
Scott: Yeah, they just wanted a place to sit which happens to be near this annoying stage You know.

431
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:20,766
Scott: and while the people on the stage love the stage people sitting near the stage.

432
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,673
Scott: Nobody gives a shit To go.

433
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:23,537
Rym: I want to do.

434
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:27,170
Rym: if packs ever had like an artist alley equivalent like a beat bring your own awesome room.

435
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:27,592
Scott: They do it.

436
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,482
Rym: I want there to be a stage in that room.

437
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:30,850
Scott: They have many stages of packs.

438
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,839
Scott: They have the mode mostly musical though.

439
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,090
Scott: You can go to the the you know, the magfest room.

440
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,970
Scott: Yeah, I want a generic stage and they have the rock band stage.

441
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,630
Rym: I want the stage where some weirdos gonna get up there and do something weird and questionable.

442
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:46,090
Scott: So you go and they could just be a sign-up sheet and you sign up and you get ten minutes.

443
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:48,890
Scott: Yeah period for set up and everything and that's it.

444
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,734
Rym: I think that'd be cool.

445
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,361
Scott: the ten minute sign-up stage.

446
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:55,880
Scott: you get up there you get ten minutes do whatever you want You can give it you can get a soapbox it you can do whatever.

447
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,830
Rym: um one victory from the con.

448
00:25:58,295 --> 00:25:59,610
Rym: We did our when we did our panel, right?

449
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,590
Rym: We did the woo game thing and we tricked.

450
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:02,632
Rym: You know We people did woo.

451
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:08,130
Rym: we give him the woo game and for the first time ever the crowd listened and I realized the problem.

452
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:18,806
Rym: If you stop the woo game No one was reacting to anything for the rep Like the second half of the panel other than this one guy on the front who was basically breaking his nose Trying to show me that he knew all the anime.

453
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:22,430
Rym: he was cool But there was like no visual feedback at all.

454
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:25,487
Rym: And then at the very end of the panel when everyone was like that was awesome.

455
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:26,050
Rym: That was awesome.

456
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,670
Rym: I was like, oh we didn't bomb it cuz everyone just said you guys I could tell when I'm doing.

457
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:30,054
Scott: I don't see.

458
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:31,570
Scott: the thing is for a panel like that.

459
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,630
Scott: I don't even need the audience reaction anymore to know if it's doing and if I'm doing it right or doing it wrong.

460
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:37,398
Rym: We will prove that we got to do it on video.

461
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:39,407
Scott: Yeah, that's your video.

462
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:39,950
Scott: I have no idea.

463
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:43,801
Scott: The only other thing is so the anime right.

464
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:45,610
Scott: so there was the main expo area.

465
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:53,250
Scott: It was the sort of secondary expo area with the gigantic awesome comic artists alley the autographs the variant stage and the podcast errors and whatnot.

466
00:26:53,972 --> 00:27:00,150
Scott: And then there was the comic panel area which is down into the right which all the comic-con panels were in this ghetto hallway.

467
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,135
Scott: That was pretty much empty.

468
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:01,799
Scott: the whole that was.

469
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:02,683
Rym: I went there Sunday.

470
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:03,910
Rym: I have some videos I grabbed.

471
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,149
Rym: It was very early empty.

472
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,263
Rym: There were maybe 50 people spread out through that entire area.

473
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:11,490
Scott: comic people were not interested in going to panels.

474
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,513
Scott: But I think there were like a few incredibly famous people panels that yeah I saw.

475
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:23,506
Rym: some of those got a big crowd and then I saw a lot of them were like Person like semi-famous person or comic arts or something doing a panel and there was there's.

476
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:25,739
Rym: there was no one in those rooms Maybe like five or ten people.

477
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,807
Rym: they were all pretty much empty.

478
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:31,462
Rym: well And if you walked all the way down to the back I don't think anyone even knew there were panel rooms over there.

479
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:32,870
Scott: Yeah, those are hidden panel rooms.

480
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:37,643
Rym: I saw three panels on Sunday in that hallway that had panelists sitting on stage.

481
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:41,764
Rym: their panels had been quote unquote going for like 20 Minutes and there was no one in the audience.

482
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:42,510
Rym: They were just sitting there.

483
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:46,385
Scott: That was the comic-con panels, but and they had another areas the anime area.

484
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:47,830
Rym: Yeah, our panel was like full.

485
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:50,033
Rym: Close the door.

486
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:53,845
Scott: they had an anime artists alley which I'm sort of for and against.

487
00:27:53,865 --> 00:28:00,747
Scott: right because it's like on the one hand you Can't charge the girl with the bookmarks the same money You're charging the comic people which is a lot of money, right?

488
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:06,669
Scott: So put them in the same table and it would be unfair to put them at the same tables in the same area and charge different amounts.

489
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:09,594
Scott: But Right on the other hand.

490
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:13,850
Scott: It's unfair to sort of put them in this ghetto, you know far away from all the action.

491
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:14,513
Rym: Here's the thing.

492
00:28:14,674 --> 00:28:20,240
Rym: if I were one of those anime people and I knew I could do well I would have just gotten a table with a comic-con instead.

493
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,906
Scott: Yeah, but it'll cost too much.

494
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:22,910
Scott: They can't afford it.

495
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,741
Scott: It wouldn't be economically feasible for them.

496
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:33,790
Scott: You know some high school girl, whatever the other thing was is like You know, they sort of hid the anime people away.

497
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:42,673
Scott: Yeah The only people who saw any of that anime stuff were people who sought it out on purpose and most people just like didn't go Down there at all.

498
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:56,960
Scott: and even people I knew who sort of wanted to get like a mixed experience And see everything and get an idea for it didn't go down there because it was a ghetto and they just didn't end up going Down there because it was out of the way in another place.

499
00:28:57,483 --> 00:28:59,110
Scott: and really you got to mix it up.

500
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,790
Scott: You know, the thing is what's the point of you know, this segregation, you know?

501
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,846
Scott: Mix it all up so that people end up being forced to experience all this different stuff.

502
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:08,910
Scott: That's what it's all about.

503
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,410
Rym: I think the trouble is and this is where why Pax is such an example.

504
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,458
Rym: I know we always harp on how awesome Pax.

505
00:29:14,478 --> 00:29:17,470
Scott: They got the tabletop and the video games and it's all mix.

506
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:18,554
Rym: Oh, but not just that.

507
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:23,030
Rym: I have a very particular and specific point because Pax is this third way.

508
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:26,403
Rym: We've got one way the Otakon way, which is we're fans.

509
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:28,250
Rym: The industry will never be the boss of us.

510
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:33,462
Rym: We're gonna do everything, you know in a kind of unprofessional way Internally, like we're all just fans.

511
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,286
Rym: No professionals.

512
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:35,050
Rym: No industry.

513
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,299
Rym: Tell us what to do and you all know the problems that causes.

514
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:48,090
Rym: the exact opposite side of that is the ultra professional Only really doing it for the money and what the industry wants which is mostly what the New York Comic Con anime festival was.

515
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:51,690
Rym: Yeah, the third way is what Pax is doing which is in the middle.

516
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,450
Rym: They're saying they've made themselves to the point where the industry needs them.

517
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:03,595
Rym: They don't need the industry because the people would go to that con if there were zero industry and it was just people playing games Yep, and I feel like.

518
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:21,310
Rym: but at the same time while they're a fan convention really they run the convention in a professional manner Yes, and like if anime cons ran themselves internally like professionals if they acted like adult professionals Even if they still told the industry to fuck itself They would be awesome.

519
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:26,006
Rym: Yeah, that third way is the way to go and Pax is the only convention I've ever seen.

520
00:30:26,086 --> 00:30:28,177
Rym: Magfest might be closed But Magfest is kind of.

521
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:29,385
Scott: we've never been to Magfest.

522
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:30,070
Scott: We don't know what it's like.

523
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,470
Scott: Yeah, we're just going based on the culture of it, which is similar to our culture.

524
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,598
Scott: We don't actually know how it's run.

525
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:35,283
Rym: We'll find out.

526
00:30:35,323 --> 00:30:36,210
Rym: I'm excited about it.

527
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,015
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna.

528
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,130
Scott: it's probably a good party, but I feel four days.

529
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:49,565
Rym: but I feel like the New York Comic Con New York anime festival combined is Really harmed by the fact that if you look at where the money is and you chart the money based on who was Important Hollywood.

530
00:30:49,868 --> 00:31:04,346
Rym: Yes the top of like the top of the comic-con hierarchy is Hollywood and under that is Big comic people like Stan Lee, you know I love on DC and under that is the indie comics and under that is old-school comics.

531
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:06,432
Rym: under that is like Gaming.

532
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:07,335
Rym: cuz Watsy was there.

533
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:08,138
Rym: They had a little thing.

534
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:08,539
Scott: Yep.

535
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,438
Rym: Yeah the whole area under that is Professional anime industry.

536
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,130
Rym: under that is fan done anime stuff.

537
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:20,890
Scott: Yeah, and it's you know, it was sort of you know, I would have rather had the con be all mix.

538
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,583
Scott: You know have mix all the panel rooms together.

539
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:33,810
Scott: be like, okay in this room It's gonna be Stan Lee at 10 followed by Riven Scott followed by a showing of some anime followed by indie comics company followed by Vamps I guess all in the same room.

540
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:41,782
Rym: I guess my worry is that and my guess is that the anime convention will never go away the anime aspect of it But it will not grow and if anything it is only there.

541
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:42,907
Scott: it was already not growing.

542
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:47,888
Rym: That's why they merged it I know and I think it's only going to exist in that ghetto forever and it's only going to be there to.

543
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:53,550
Rym: you know All I've noticed that there's the same group of people like anime fans that go to every single anime related thing in New York.

544
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,174
Rym: Yeah Every anime thing.

545
00:31:55,194 --> 00:32:00,051
Rym: they're there and they'll all go to this forever and they don't bother with the comic-con stuff and the comic-con doesn't bother With them.

546
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,778
Rym: Yep, kind of sad.

547
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,601
Scott: It's gonna.

548
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:10,186
Scott: it's a way to easily up the numbers, you know They put in a tiny little artists alley They put in some panel rooms and they get a whole.

549
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:10,930
Scott: they get all that.

550
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,434
Scott: You know time people coming in.

551
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:18,290
Rym: there was one good panel that had a bunch of audience at the comic-con area on Sunday.

552
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:18,809
Scott: What was it?

553
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,905
Rym: It was the kind of panel that we would do or that an anime person would do.

554
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:23,488
Scott: who was doing it?

555
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:23,990
Rym: if they were?

556
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:29,190
Rym: I Don't even know but if you were doing like at an anime con they did the archaeology of Indiana Jones.

557
00:32:29,752 --> 00:32:31,621
Rym: Oh interesting like how you know, what was feasible?

558
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:32,184
Rym: What wasn't?

559
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:33,410
Rym: where'd all these legends come from?

560
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,112
Rym: What would you know?

561
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:35,962
Rym: What did they use and not you?

562
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:37,027
Scott: it was really well done.

563
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:39,616
Rym: I like that Yeah, and it was packed nice.

564
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:41,041
Rym: and yet that was.

565
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:44,170
Rym: that was not the average panel in the comic.

566
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:47,501
Scott: Yeah, most of the comic panel areas were we're a company.

567
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:53,090
Rym: We're gonna make our announcements and They looked like we're a company.

568
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:57,530
Rym: We're doing this panels that we can then say in a press release that we did this panel.

569
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,869
Rym: Yeah, that's what it seemed like as no one was in those panels.

570
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:10,086
Rym: So anyway things of the day.

571
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:15,080
Rym: this guy made a shrubbery shaped like a cock and balls and he got in trouble with the law.

572
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:18,973
Scott: That's it You must give us.

573
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:28,406
Rym: It's a pretty good cock and balls - So this guy he's.

574
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,309
Scott: he works at Sega.

575
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:30,052
Scott: his name is Jerry.

576
00:33:30,232 --> 00:33:40,020
Scott: he got married to some hot lady named cat And their cake for their wedding was shaped like the macross, however, it was not just shaped like the macross.

577
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:44,257
Scott: They also made recreated a scene from macross the.

578
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:49,376
Scott: you know The wedding flight is the scene that is recreated for.

579
00:33:49,436 --> 00:33:54,190
Scott: therefore their wedding They recreated an anime wedding in cake and plastic model.

580
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:55,594
Rym: That's pretty awesome.

581
00:33:55,694 --> 00:33:57,458
Scott: Yeah, look at that not bad.

582
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:05,409
Scott: So If you if you are a woman and if you're imagining a wedding involving this cake marry me.

583

00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:32,820
Rym: It's something I don't think many of you have seen and the subtitles that I watched were translated from Russian to English.

597
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:42,692
Scott: Well, that's because this anime was actually a Russian Japanese co-production in 1969. that's really really old like way old.

598
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,820
Rym: and guess who did the key animation?

599
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:50,101
Scott: Well, one of the people did the key animation was Miyazaki in 69.

600
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:54,797
Scott: He was animating this movie and the thing is it's only a 60-minute movie, which is kind of.

601
00:34:54,877 --> 00:34:55,760
Scott: it's kind of nice, right?

602
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,520
Scott: It's like you get an anime movie.

603
00:34:58,421 --> 00:34:59,725
Scott: They don't have to wait 90 minutes.

604
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:00,888
Scott: You only gotta wait 60 minutes.

605
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:01,249
Scott: It's over.

606
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,215
Rym: It might have been nice had it been better.

607
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:12,353
Rym: Oh snap so The flying ghost ship is literally about a flying ghost ship.

608
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:14,499
Scott: really you don't say it's.

609
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:19,777
Rym: They started out and you expect it to follow this certain kind of vibe.

610
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:23,960
Scott: right in the beginning It was sort of Hardy Boys sort of Johnny Quest sort of Scooby Doo, right?

611
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:27,676
Scott: You know, there's a kid on a boat with his parents and he's got a dog.

612
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,930
Scott: The dog doesn't talk but it has a lot of personality.

613
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:33,100
Rym: now now this dog is basically Scooby.

614
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:37,460
Rym: It's Scooby Doo, but it doesn't talk and the kid Hayato is even wearing a goddamn ascot.

615
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:44,779
Scott: Yeah, you know he's not it's not Scooby Doo cuz he doesn't talk but it is might as well be right and the kid is basically Fred.

616
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,483
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but none of the other Scooby cast is in it It's just him know.

617
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:53,077
Rym: so Hayato is on the boat with his family and this gets into space.

618
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:58,943
Scott: crabs in the end Don't play you skipping and spoiling the crab people That's not.

619
00:35:58,964 --> 00:36:00,452
Rym: that's not the spoiler the spoilers.

620
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,820
Rym: who was running the crab people?

621
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,335
Scott: Yeah, so anyway, they see a car crash right and they go to investigate.

622
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,519
Scott: now that way and his eight people?

623
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,939
Rym: now Here's where it gets crazy.

624
00:36:09,402 --> 00:36:17,560
Rym: so Hayato is just on the boat with his dad and everything's all cool and Everyone likes to hold their mouths open for a way long time after they stopped talking.

625
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:20,440
Scott: They also like to sense because it was Russian mouth movements.

626
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:27,989
Rym: But they also when they're just like they're not talking and a character just kind of looking at something Their mouth is usually open and their brows furrowed.

627
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,659
Rym: They make the look that someone who is dumb and angry makes.

628
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,209
Rym: I Wasn't looking that close and they make this.

629
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:42,439
Rym: they basically look like this all the time But like it kind of looks like the guy in that one Perry Bible Fellowship with the scar-eyed shark and he figures it out.

630
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:45,785
Rym: They all kind of make that face.

631
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:49,236
Rym: now Jack has this bag and they never really explain the dog.

632
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:49,858
Scott: Jack's the dog.

633
00:36:49,878 --> 00:36:52,597
Rym: Jack the dog Has this bag and he's got all his stuff in it.

634
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:56,008
Scott: Yeah, they don't really explain it Like we let in the beginning.

635
00:36:56,049 --> 00:37:01,914
Scott: the subtitle is like we let you hold the bag But then throughout the rest of the movie, it's pretty much just like it's they make.

636
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:03,660
Scott: it's sort of like it's the dog's bag.

637
00:37:03,742 --> 00:37:09,363
Scott: It belongs to him Yeah, and he keeps all the points in it his doggy stuff in the bag and it's just a thing He has.

638
00:37:09,403 --> 00:37:11,554
Scott: they don't really explain why or how it's got.

639
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:16,160
Scott: I like the idea of like Especially that one part where he sort of whips it around his neck, you know, that was a key.

640
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,824
Rym: Yeah, he's like.

641
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:18,694
Rym: he's like I'm courage dog now.

642
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:19,679
Scott: Yeah, let's go.

643
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,260
Rym: So but they see a car accident, right?

644
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,800
Rym: They're on a boat and this car just flies off a cliff like a hundred feet up and crashes upside down.

645
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:31,553
Scott: They go and investigate and it's the boss of the company the dads works for.

646
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:33,822
Scott: that's like if I work for Microsoft and I saw A car crash.

647
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:34,425
Scott: I go and investigate.

648
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:35,047
Scott: It's Bill Gates.

649
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:35,911

Scott: She is Steve bomber.

652
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:42,595
Rym: Oh shit I thought it was Kuro Shiro, but no, she is Kuro Shiro.

653
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:44,120
Rym: Yeah, cuz Emily was like black white.

654

660
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:07,867

Scott: Yeah, they get both of them up there somehow and what are they gonna do?

664
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,620
Rym: The mom went off in the boat to call the police and they're like, well, we'll just wait for mom.

Scott: Yeah.

675
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,379
Rym: I was kind of a dick.

00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,265
Rym: though He's like, what do you mean?

677
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,936
Rym: a skeleton in the road the fuck's wrong with.

678
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:49,072
Scott: actually I kind of like that cuz it showed the characters weren't moronic right?

679
00:38:49,112 --> 00:38:52,794
Scott: the scooby-doo people would be like a go You know shaggy like oh my god a ghost.

680
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:53,640
Scott: and it's like dude.

681
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:58,158
Scott: You've seen a hundred people take off ghost masks and you still think it's actually gonna be a ghost.

682
00:38:58,178 --> 00:39:02,170
Scott: this time At least this kid Hayato is just like a ghost.

683
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,857
Scott: really sometimes they did.

684
00:39:03,937 --> 00:39:05,685
Scott: I'm eight years old I don't believe in that shit.

685
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:08,879
Rym: Sometimes they take the mask off and it's red herring.

686
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:14,565
Scott: That's wrong show that's Canon.

687
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:18,714
Scott: it's not canon because it happens away in the future.

688
00:39:19,115 --> 00:39:22,128
Rym: now the funny thing is when they're on the boat in the beginning It's canon.

689
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:30,360
Rym: if they age like Merlin They have this weird shot where they show his mom like look at this perfect smiling mom and that reeked of she's totally gonna die.

690
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:32,806
Rym: Yeah, yeah, she totally dies.

691
00:39:32,826 --> 00:39:38,940
Rym: But anyway, so they get into the spooky mansion and it's full of like Ravens and just crazy.

692
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:45,082
Rym: It's totally spooky all over the place on purpose and everyone's afraid and they lay everybody down and then immediately What do they do?

693
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:46,769
Rym: The dad's like let's split up.

694
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,155
Rym: I'm gonna go get firewood.

695
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:49,440
Rym: you guys wander around.

696
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,068
Scott: So they wander around and investigate.

697
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:53,032
Rym: they leave courage.

698
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:54,820
Rym: Oh just laying on the couch unconscious still.

699
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:58,594
Scott: Yeah, it's like he's gonna wake up and empty in this empty scary house.

700
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:03,320
Scott: He'll think he's in hell or some shit You don't know anyway or think he's been kidnapped.

701
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:13,978
Rym: Oh remember when the wife first wakes up on the road and she's like lightning strikes and she sees the dad's face and she's like For no reason and then she's like, oh, oh, it's just a guy just a dude.

702
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:14,460
Scott: That's a dude.

703
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:22,511
Scott: Alright, let's uh, so they investigate and of course they find a skeleton Rooting through the fridge a guy in a skeleton mask.

704
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:24,096
Scott: No clearly living in the fridge.

705
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:25,320
Rym: It must be a real skeleton.

706
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:33,140
Rym: Yeah real skeletons go in fridges all the time, but it's rooted in the fridge and The way they were they literally walk into the room and there's a guy rooting through the fridge.

707
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:39,664
Rym: they tap on the back he turns around skeleton face and it just cuts between the skeletons face and The mom's face.

708
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,834
Scott: Well, no the the what the wife the wife of Kuroshio's face.

709
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:49,598
Rym: and there is this like 30-second scene where she makes all these different faces, but doesn't scream.

710
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:55,991
Rym: She's like And then she screams.

711
00:40:56,374 --> 00:41:01,437
Scott: yeah, like it is hilarious I basically showed every state and then the animation in this isn't?

712
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:03,165
Scott: you know There's no music to speak of.

713
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:11,756
Scott: really right and the animation is pretty like, you know The drawing and the colors are actually pretty good for 69, but the animation is a lot of panning.

714
00:41:11,777 --> 00:41:20,219
Scott: There's a lot of You know still shot with the moving mouth, you know, there's a lot of back, you know You know the water just goes wish wish wish wish back and forth.

715
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:26,960
Rym: There's a lot of times where like a particular like movement is really really well animated and everything else is just completely static.

716
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:31,720
Scott: Yeah, like the dog whips the bag around his neck is really well animated but at the background

717
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:53,339
Rym: The wife screaming because you know angry video game nerd James Rolfe is doing his monster madness right now and in old 50s horror movies It's a common trope for a woman to you know The heroine to run into like a skeleton face like in the screaming skull and not scream right away But just like stare in increasing shock and then scream and pass out.

718
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,632
Rym: Yep, and that is what she does but the way it is animated.

719
00:41:56,652 --> 00:42:01,060
Rym: I was laughing so hard it hurts Like I couldn't deal with it.

720
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:07,964
Scott: So then the this after they run away from that the dad comes back with a firewood and then eventually the police show up But before the police.

721
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:10,278
Rym: no, no, no, the police don't show up before

722
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:11,644
Scott: the police All right, but yeah the

723
00:42:11,705 --> 00:42:14,296
Rym: chief of defense for the country shows up, but

724
00:42:14,336 --> 00:42:22,202
Scott: before he shows up Basically the goat does the skeleton haunts them and scares them and tells them spooky mess Which was

725
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:25,454
Rym: good because up until that point they forget about that skeleton pretty quick.

726
00:42:25,655 --> 00:42:34,460
Rym: They run away and the dad's like hey Hey, and then the skeleton shows up and it's like, oh you're bad There's a good series of scares where they get back and they're there.

727
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,755
Rym: They're like, oh my god, there was a skeleton and then something's coming.

728
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,763
Rym: Oh, it's the dogs the thing You know, it's the dead.

729
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:40,646
Rym: something's coming.

730
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:41,950
Rym: Oh, it's the skeleton.

731
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,896
Scott: Yeah, the thing is obviously though.

732
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,040
Scott: The skeleton was not real.

733
00:42:45,101 --> 00:42:46,440
Scott: It's totally got a mask, right?

734
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,409
Scott: and it's like how is he scaring them from this window?

735
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:52,648
Scott: and if the kid throws a rock at the window and breaks the Window and it goes right through the skeleton.

736
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:54,174
Rym: It's like I want to call bullshit.

737
00:42:54,214 --> 00:42:59,088
Scott: on a later scene later scene They say that he says oh, yeah That was using a projector onto the glass.

738
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:01,960
Scott: then shouldn't the part of the glass that was broken made?

739
00:43:02,341 --> 00:43:05,091
Scott: Yeah, you know made part of the skeleton disappear, but it didn't.

740
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:09,466
Rym: but the ghost is like, ooh I'm a spooky ghost.

741
00:43:09,847 --> 00:43:11,051
Rym: I was murdered.

742
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:16,328
Rym: I was left on a boat and burned by someone And then the cops come.

743
00:43:16,368 --> 00:43:17,414
Rym: he's like I gotta go.

744
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:20,258
Scott: now The cops are coming.

745
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:28,320
Scott: I Yeah, ha all the cops, you know if I can bust out and goes never do that.

746
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:33,020
Rym: But then as soon as the chief of defense comes curse, he was like, yeah that guy's back.

747
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:35,150
Rym: We got to do something about this ghost ship.

748
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:40,139
Scott: So you immediately know that The red herring girl she was a bad guy.

749
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:49,519
Rym: So then the movie just kind of picks up with the kid and his family just doing the normal stuff like dad and kid are In a car in the city and then a robot attacks the town.

750
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:54,380
Scott: Yeah out of nowhere a giant robot attacks the city and smashes the fuck out of everything.

751
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,104
Scott: It's like what.

752
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,254
Scott: what the hell did that have to do with scooby-doo?

753
00:43:57,274 --> 00:43:58,460
Scott: suddenly scooby-doo is over.

754
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:00,780
Scott: It's astro boy time, but the lead-up to this is awesome.

755
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:06,568
Rym: There's like five full minutes of the kid being like I like to drink boa juice And he's like you shouldn't drink so much of that.

756
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:12,879
Rym: and then they're just talking about mom and talking about stuff It's like.

757
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,050
Rym: But they kind of goes down like it's a weird.

758
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,160
Rym: they say it funny but they use that.

759
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,174
Rym: I think they showed this on TV and actually use those as the commercial brakes.

760
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:30,720
Rym: Maybe I don't know I wouldn't be surprised anyway But then then suddenly your traffic's been stopped for a long time like they're stuck in traffic and normally in a show.

761
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:31,826
Rym: That's just kind of like you.

762
00:44:31,846 --> 00:44:33,716
Rym: don't worry about that in this.

763
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:40,280
Rym: after a while The dad's like, you know The traffic hasn't moved in a while and then immediately fucking tanks destroy every goddamn car on the road.

764
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:45,337
Scott: Yeah the tank the tanks that which are people are driving them trying to help save the town from the robot.

765
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:51,418
Scott: the Military in the tank doesn't care about killing people and then they fail to kill the robot.

766
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:52,000
Rym: but it's great.

767
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:59,634
Rym: The tanks just crush all these cars probably kill a whole bunch of people and then they just start shooting and then the camera spins Around and you see they're shooting at some building.

768
00:44:59,694 --> 00:45:01,683
Rym: Oh, no, that's not a building It's a giant robot.

769
00:45:02,245 --> 00:45:07,784
Rym: and then golem the robot says I am golem the robot the robot who was sent to destroy you by the Ghost ship.

770
00:45:07,926 --> 00:45:09,420
Rym: I am golem goes robot.

771
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,200
Scott: So golem is working for the ghost ship and to destroy the town and the military is fighting back.

772
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:18,740
Scott: And you haven't even seen the ghost ship yet, so all you know is the title is flying ghost ship.

773
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:25,853
Scott: So it's like why would the ghost ship that I don't even know about Anything where it's comes from or anything about it send a robot to destroy the town?

774
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,003
Rym: and the robot isn't using missiles or heat get Erase or anything.

775
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:33,460
Rym: He just has two big mace fists and he's just fucking smashing stuff, but he's gigantic.

776
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,704
Scott: He's bigger than a skyscraper.

777
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:41,325
Rym: So he is smashing shit up big time and they show you you're pretty sure the body count on this Movie is astronaut.

778
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,152
Rym: I'm pretty sure most of the people in the world are dead.

779
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:55,360
Scott: if that was New York City like Millions are dead millions of people would have been killed in that robot attack and they actually do a somewhat Astro-boyish job of portraying the fact that all these people actually did die.

780
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,700
Scott: It was a horrible massacre catastrophe that spanned many miles in many bodies.

781
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,880
Rym: The dead is pretty smart because he you know, he gets hit on the head and it sounds like I'll take you to the hospital.

782
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,847
Rym: He's like the hospital.

783
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:06,370
Rym: Are you kidding?

784
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,075
Rym: Let's just go home.

785
00:46:07,256 --> 00:46:10,858
Rym: Yeah, and Sure enough home smashed mom's dead.

786
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:25,020
Rym: And thus this is why Leiji Matsumoto is a brilliant brilliant man because when he wants to do melodrama He has motherfucking melodrama up in your business and you cannot help but get caught up in his melodrama moment.

787
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,259
Scott: That's right this movie.

788
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:34,086
Rym: The kid is sitting there crying over his dead mom and it's a great scene and the man for many minutes He is just screaming.

789
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:34,790
Rym: Why did you die?

790
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,595
Rym: Why did you leave me?

791
00:46:35,635 --> 00:46:36,460
Rym: Very melodramatic.

792
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:42,220
Rym: Then his dad is like, how's mom is she gonna make it and he's like mom just died.

793
00:46:42,462 --> 00:46:46,404
Rym: And then the dad's like I'm gonna die soon, too But you're not my son.

794
00:46:46,725 --> 00:46:51,860
Rym: and then the dad dies and then there's double melodrama and it's like mom dies dad dies.

795
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,176
Rym: You're not my son all at once.

796
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:58,176
Rym: No, Matt, no elegance or mastery was used in this melodrama.

797
00:46:58,397 --> 00:46:59,340
Scott: None whatsoever.

798
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:00,446
Scott: It immediately goes off.

799
00:47:00,466 --> 00:47:02,155
Scott: I didn't care at all.

800
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,265
Rym: I was like, okay The mom death was sad.

801
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:07,893
Scott: the mom didn't even have any lines she was just seemed.

802
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:16,300
Scott: oh she said she said okay Okay, she was definitely, you know, she was definitely portrayed as a cool mom, but she didn't say anything or do anything.

803
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,355
Rym: She said okay when his dad said go behind the police in the boat.

804
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:23,020
Rym: Yeah, that's right But it was literally like he's crying over his mom.

805
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:32,211
Rym: He's crying over his dad and then it cuts to him standing by himself on top of the ruins of his house with the dog Looking all melodramatic and hopeful and sad and everything.

806
00:47:32,232 --> 00:47:34,239
Rym: and then he tells the dog he hates it and go away.

807
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:35,062
Rym: and then he says Never mind.

808
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:35,786
Rym: I love you dog.

809
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:37,415
Rym: And it's just all this drama.

810
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:38,380
Rym: That's going nowhere.

811
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:40,806
Scott: And then what does he decide to do?

812
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:42,471
Scott: to go to mr.

813
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:45,120
Scott: Kuroshio's house the evil head of the company?

814
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:45,883
Scott: He doesn't know he's evil.

815
00:47:45,923 --> 00:47:47,350
Rym: Yeah, he gets adopted basically.

816
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,238
Scott: Yeah, he like goes gets adopted by mr.

817
00:47:49,278 --> 00:47:49,781
Scott: Kuroshio Cuz.

818
00:47:49,801 --> 00:47:50,846
Scott: he doesn't have anywhere else to go.

819
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:53,360
Scott: He doesn't have any friends or family or anything.

820
00:47:54,023 --> 00:47:57,500
Rym: They probably all got crushed by the robot and they're like, all right your stepson now, that's cool.

821
00:47:58,163 --> 00:48:00,576
Scott: It's like really I'll go to Bill Gates house if that's gonna work.

822
00:48:00,656 --> 00:48:04,217
Rym: and then immediately golem comes back and attacks the ghost ship.

823
00:48:04,659 --> 00:48:06,286
Rym: and This is when things get awesome.

824
00:48:06,306 --> 00:48:09,900
Rym: because the ghost ship before you see like this like ghost ship floating out in the water.

825
00:48:10,442 --> 00:48:14,840
Rym: It just fucking flies out of the water and has missiles coming out of it and it just fight.

826
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:22,120
Scott: Yeah, it looks like a really old busted ship like a ghost ship, but it's got really modern missiles and shop coming out of it.

827
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,249
Scott: So obviously inside it's a modern ship.

828
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:26,920
Rym: I like how they show the same features technologies.

829
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,637
Rym: They show the same missile coming out like a hundred times.

830
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:30,120
Scott: Yeah, right.

831
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:32,229
Scott: So it's like wait a minute.

832
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,660
Scott: I thought golem was working for go ship.

833
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,515
Scott: Why is golem fighting go ship and the kid doesn't know who to root for?

834
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:38,599
Scott: cuz he's like fuck that evil.

835
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:38,940
Scott: go ship.

836
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,854
Scott: Wait, fuck that evil golem who killed my parents.

837
00:48:40,894 --> 00:48:41,539
Scott: Wait, what what?

838
00:48:42,601 --> 00:48:47,116
Rym: so of course the kid wanders around in the mansion of Kuroshio who's not around.

839
00:48:47,136 --> 00:48:51,159
Rym: he disappeared somewhere and Finds a room that just has a chair in the middle of it.

840
00:48:51,582 --> 00:48:57,316
Scott: So he sits in this weird room that has a chair and of course It's Batman chair, of course right before it happened.

841
00:48:57,356 --> 00:48:57,960
Scott: It goes to do it.

842
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:03,920
Scott: It's like you when you want to hide something like that You don't make a room that has a chair in it because that stands out so bad.

843
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,137
Scott: What you do is you take your regular old chair and you have a bus next to it with a secret button.

844
00:49:08,439 --> 00:49:10,628
Rym: even Adam West Batman.

845
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:13,100
Rym: you had to move the statue to make it appear.

846
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,520
Scott: So I said you had to tilt the bus head push the button and then the bookcase open.

847
00:49:17,607 --> 00:49:22,600
Rym: No This guy has a room as big as our GeekNights studio with just a chair in the middle of it and nothing else.

848
00:49:23,022 --> 00:49:26,560
Scott: So the kid goes down in the chair and he gets to the bottom and there's another chair.

849
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:28,085
Rym: I love that.

850
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:31,220
Rym: so he's like this warrants exploration.

851
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:36,636
Scott: So he checks out the second chair and that takes him to see the secret evil base.

852
00:49:36,817 --> 00:49:38,724
Scott: We're clearly dr Evil's base.

853
00:49:38,824 --> 00:49:41,860
Rym: clearly they have built a golem because golem comes back to get repaired.

854
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,560
Scott: Why is golem in this base and hit the whole time?

855
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,357
Rym: He's just sitting in the chair not thinking what if I get caught down here?

856
00:49:47,397 --> 00:49:47,840
Rym: What's going on?

857
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,689
Rym: He's thinking he's just trying to figure out the mystery.

858
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:51,819
Rym: I sure hope we solve this mystery.

859
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:56,671
Scott: So the best part is that my favorite scene is the one that comes up next.

860
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:58,437
Rym: Oh my god with the robot justice.

861
00:49:58,577 --> 00:49:59,239
Scott: robot justice.

862
00:50:00,421 --> 00:50:14,760
Scott: so so he goes to the basically takes the chair all the way the end and apparently Kuroshio and the defense minister and all the evil guys are having a meeting and They're yelling at the defense minister because apparently golem failed and golem was the defense minister's idea.

863
00:50:15,021 --> 00:50:19,920
Scott: And this is great because the other people are like listen, they're like listen, dude, your golem idea didn't work.

864
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:30,891
Scott: You wanted to destroy the city and blame it on golem and have golem blame it on the ghost ship to make everyone hate the Ghost ship, but then you attack the ghost ship, but then you attack the ghost ship But now the whole thing has failed.

865
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:31,859
Scott: and look what you cost us.

866
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,525
Scott: Your golem was wicked expensive.

867
00:50:33,926 --> 00:50:41,615
Scott: all those, you know, military tanks and airplanes you destroyed with the golem were expensive And the whole time all the city all the city you destroyed and the people you killed.

868
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:42,700
Scott: it was really expensive.

869
00:50:43,424 --> 00:50:46,720
Scott: They don't care about the morality they care about the expense.

870
00:50:47,303 --> 00:50:51,139
Scott: Right now like your plan totally failed and cost too much money What do you have to say for yourself now?

871
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:57,300
Rym: The scene was very reminiscent of like the nerve and the sele scenes in Ava except that it was stupid.

872
00:50:58,242 --> 00:51:00,395
Scott: So he's like don't even you don't even get to say anything.

873
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:01,180
Scott: We know what you're gonna say.

874
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:02,295
Rym: He just sits there the whole time.

875
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:06,631
Scott: like So like we're Minister of Defense, we're gonna let this computer.

876
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:08,197
Scott: this computer knows everything you did.

877
00:51:08,217 --> 00:51:08,880
Scott: It's great.

878
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,410
Rym: He's like we're gonna lose all your sins.

879
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,880
Scott: We're gonna let the computer decide your fate.

880
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,826
Scott: It's like oh my god computer justice.

881
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:20,540
Rym: and literally he's like slides a punch card through the computer and it just sits there going.

882
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:26,400
Scott: It's like that episode of the Twilight Zone where there's a computer that tells them how to survive in the post-apocalypse.

883
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,026
Rym: Thank you, Peter.

884
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:33,380
Scott: The computer is right But then when they find out that it is a computer they smash it and then they fail to live in the post-apocalypse.

885
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:34,616
Scott: Cuz they didn't listen to the computer.

886
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:36,365
Rym: Yep But basically it's.

887
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:41,386
Rym: the scene is long and then the computer stops and it's all quiet for a while and everyone should stare into the defense minister.

888
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:45,991
Rym: the defense minister is sitting there like And then his chair just gets dumped down.

889
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:48,120
Rym: he disappears and then they're like, alright and they move on.

890
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,397
Scott: But then the kid is in this room meanwhile watching and the room is a glass floor.

891
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:53,220
Scott: You can see the ocean.

892
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,953
Rym: But I love how you see the guy's hat just kind of float by in the ocean.

893
00:51:55,993 --> 00:52:00,954
Scott: Yeah, it's like ah snap He got eaten by the fishes or drowned or whatever some combination of the above.

894
00:52:01,235 --> 00:52:02,520
Rym: but the funniest thing.

895
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:10,180
Rym: I almost want to make a Dave and Joel tribute here because at one point after they kill the defense minister They're arguing about what to do now and they turn to this one guy on the board.

896
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,820
Rym: They're like you come up with a plan and the guy looks so Japanese and so befuddled.

897
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:19,516
Rym: There is no way that he is not Tanaka as in the Tanaka of Dave and Joel.

898
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:20,780
Scott: He's definitely that was Tanaka.

899
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:24,780
Rym: I feel like you could take Dave and Joel audio and put it over the scene and just make something epic.

900
00:52:25,002 --> 00:52:25,879
Scott: It would be so awesome.

901
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:44,404
Rym: So the kid is like I gotta tell the world about this and he's mad and he's like Kuroshio killed my dad my mom and my dad It wasn't the ghost ship and he's punching the wall and there's this fucking button on the wall and he accidentally punches the button And sets off the alarms and then he's like, oh no, they must have found out I'm in here somehow

902
00:52:45,147 --> 00:52:48,240
Scott: and then he runs away and he succeeds in running away with no trouble.

903
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,114
Rym: Now does this the rest of this before we?

904
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,644
Rym: because we didn't talk about Certain things yet.

905
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,895
Rym: You remember this movie that our friend Amber made us watch called the stuff.

906
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,120
Scott: I Remember being forced to watch it, but I don't remember it at all.

907
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,420
Rym: The plot of the stuff was a meteor landed and it had this stuff in it that tasted really good.

908
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:10,169
Rym: So they market and sell it to people and if you eat it Eventually turns into a zombie and then turns you into it.

909
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:10,591
Scott: All right.

910
00:53:10,631 --> 00:53:12,680
Scott: Well, isn't that the same shit is like Slurm, right?

911
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,148
Rym: Yeah, kinda except Slurm didn't turn you into anything.

912
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:18,019
Rym: It turned you into a big fat Slurm only if you had the special Slurm.

913
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:23,616
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but in the stuff, you know, and the thing is some people figure this out and no one believes them.

914
00:53:24,138 --> 00:53:33,180
Rym: So The movie cuts to Tanaka not Tanaka to Hayato Going to the police being like look I found the secret base and I know we're going me and the police.

915
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:36,273
Scott: It's like what really the police are not gonna believe that story dude.

916
00:53:36,615 --> 00:53:37,760
Rym: The police are like, yeah, what the fuck?

917
00:53:38,463 --> 00:53:41,515
Rym: So he tries to tell people in the street and they don't care.

918
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:42,900
Scott: It's a they-live situation.

919
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:45,129
Scott: It's actually that like the camera angles.

920
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,355
Scott: He actually reminded me of.

921
00:53:46,395 --> 00:53:48,764
Scott: they live like you, you know These people were.

922
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:51,373
Scott: you know, they ate the bad people and yeah sunglasses on.

923
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:53,179
Rym: Yeah, one of the guys did have sunglasses.

924
00:53:53,259 --> 00:53:53,460
Scott: Yeah.

925
00:53:54,521 --> 00:54:06,240
Rym: But then while he's telling these people suddenly one guy melts into goop in the street Randomly and then a whole bunch of other people melt into goop and all these people had bottles of boa juice.

926
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:08,499
Scott: And it's like obviously the boa juice makes people melt.

927
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:09,323
Scott: There's a reason.

928
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:14,360
Rym: they were focusing on boa juice before and it was just like in the stuff and no one's gonna believe him either.

929
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,274
Rym: And then he's freaking out and he's not think he's a boa juice drinker.

930
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:19,760
Rym: Yeah, he drinks a ton of boa juice.

931
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:21,397
Rym: Yeah, and apparently is for.

932
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,420
Rym: But if we're to believe what the movie has told us today most of the people in the world drink a lot of boa juice.

933
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:36,879
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's basically imagine if coca-cola made you disintegrate into coca-cola.

934
00:54:37,301 --> 00:54:38,959
Scott: Yeah, everyone's drinking it.

935
00:54:39,441 --> 00:54:48,092
Rym: But he doesn't have time to react to this because he's immediately picked up by these yakuza looking dude clamps That were sent by Kuroshio to bring him back.

936
00:54:48,132 --> 00:54:49,720
Rym: He's like, oh no curse you knows I broke in.

937
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,190
Scott: The thing is these guys bring him back and what do they do?

938
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:54,400
Scott: and it's like they're acting all evil like mugsy and bugsy.

939
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,425
Scott: They're gonna take him back.

940
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:57,557
Scott: Yeah, we caught you kid and it's like oh shit.

941
00:54:57,577 --> 00:54:58,060
Scott: He got caught.

942
00:54:58,524 --> 00:55:00,259
Scott: They just bring him to go beep on TV.

943
00:55:00,544 --> 00:55:00,869
Scott: It's like what?

944
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,606
Scott: So obviously Kuroshio doesn't know this kid knows anything because he just wants to put him on TV to talk about how evil the ghost Ship is.

945
00:55:07,626 --> 00:55:15,993
Scott: because you know He thought he thinks the kids still upset about having his parents being killed by golem in the ghost And this is the best Astro Boy moment of the entire.

946
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:17,580
Rym: but it's like why did you send thugs?

947
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,745
Scott: We're all evil to get him.

948
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:19,893
Scott: It should have just been Kuroshio.

949
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:24,470
Rym: Like hey, let's go the TV piece I think the Simpsons gives us precedence for that when there's knock-knock.

950
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:25,152
Rym: Who's there?

951
00:55:25,273 --> 00:55:27,600
Rym: goons goons who hired goons?

952
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:32,420
Rym: And then, you know burns bring, you know, they bring him in and he's just like a hired goons.

953
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,351
Rym: That's what I said, like should I have sent something else?

954
00:55:35,451 --> 00:55:36,234
Rym: Yeah, how would I?

955
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:37,700
Rym: how else am I gonna get you to come?

956
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,930
Rym: Yeah, right exactly I mean hired goons are probably all this guy has cuz.

957
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,040
Rym: he is really really evil really.

958
00:55:43,502 --> 00:55:47,940
Rym: But this is an Astro Boy moment because the guys like what do you do to fight the ghost ship?

959
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,154
Rym: If you like we let you like and it's just TV shows on TV.

960
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:54,900
Scott: He's on world TV like everyone can see him and the kid is like.

961
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:57,946
Rym: Well, then of course use the evil guy.

962
00:55:58,127 --> 00:55:58,528
Rym: I saw it.

963
00:55:58,668 --> 00:55:59,571
Rym: the secret bases under.

964
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:06,280
Scott: he tells the entire story all the ultra rare Beams are spilled and then they then they interrupt him with some boa juice commercials.

965
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,940
Rym: Yeah, but the message non-stop message already got out and there's all these scenes of people watching the TV going.

966
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:18,680
Scott: but the problem here is the movie at this point explodes because Boa was watching that Boa Boa was watching.

967
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:23,316
Scott: So now basically you don't realize, you know Kuroshio was only the the regular boss.

968
00:56:23,376 --> 00:56:24,660
Scott: Boa was the square boss.

969
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,707
Scott: So Boa is like, oh shit.

970
00:56:26,747 --> 00:56:28,332
Scott: Now the whole world knows I exist.

971
00:56:28,392 --> 00:56:30,138
Scott: Well time to fight back.

972
00:56:30,158 --> 00:56:36,539
Scott: So immediately Gigantic robot crabs that were apparently hiding in the walls of everything appear everywhere.

973
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:39,320
Scott: I don't know how they were hiding without anyone noticing them.

974
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:48,167
Scott: They were gigantic robot crabs, but the giant robot crab people appear everywhere in the whole world all at once also Big blue lobsters.

975
00:56:48,228 --> 00:56:55,280
Scott: Yeah, the blue lobsters and the red crabs everywhere They're robots and they freaking attack and they disintegrate Kuroshio pretty quick.

976
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,891
Rym: They pick him up and the voice comes like and it's like I am Boa.

977
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:00,415
Rym: What the fuck dude.

978
00:57:00,616 --> 00:57:02,945
Scott: You totally Kuroshio You have fucked up.

979
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:04,372
Scott: you are now disintegrated.

980
00:57:04,432 --> 00:57:09,500
Rym: and then he spit some bubbles on him Which I guess are boa juice and turns them into boa juice super concentrated boa juice.

981
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:14,460
Rym: So the kid runs away and there's panic everywhere and by this point I'm pretty sure he's about to get killed by the crabs.

982
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,656
Scott: But then finally the flying ghost ship comes in and rescues.

983
00:57:18,716 --> 00:57:24,578
Rym: if I had to summarize how Stupid and crazy this movie is the scene where he is saved by the ghost ship.

984
00:57:24,598 --> 00:57:31,668
Rym: the ghost ship Which looks like a radio chip is just floating over the city with like a beam Pulling him into the body UFO.

985
00:57:31,688 --> 00:57:37,740
Rym: and then they pull him on and they're like, we're the ghost ship We're fighting Boa Boa's evil.

986
00:57:38,482 --> 00:57:44,324
Rym: Let's show you the ship and diagram and the blueprints and tell you about all the things in the ship that we're gonna use in The rest of the movie.

987
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:50,620
Scott: Yeah, it was totally like, you know a diagram of Mazinger Enumerate the powers of the ghost shit.

988
00:57:50,640 --> 00:58:00,965
Rym: I've got a laser on the front and an EMG on the back and I've got a radar blocker and a wave motion gun The the skeleton.

989
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:04,020
Rym: yeah dude in a mask he's like, yeah, I wear a mask as my face was burned.

990
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,942
Scott: Yeah, you just suddenly like the guy with the skeleton mask is the captain of the ghost ship and he just has a friendly chat With him.

991
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:10,230
Scott: He's just like hey, so you're the captain.

992
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,680
Scott: Yeah, why do you wear that mask all the time?

993
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:15,280
Scott: Cuz my face was horribly burned and I want everyone to see it and I'm used to wearing the mask.

994
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:15,762
Scott: Okay.

995
00:58:15,882 --> 00:58:18,752
Rym: Yeah, also our ship is invisible to radar when we turn on this thing.

996
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:21,240
Rym: So yeah, that's why we're the ghost ship.

997
00:58:21,844 --> 00:58:25,684
Rym: and then the kid freaks out and Clearly it is the Boa poisoning.

998
00:58:25,704 --> 00:58:27,109
Rym: He's gonna turn into Boa juice.

999
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:31,522
Scott: Yep, and he accidentally hits a button that turns off the radar Invisibility.

1000
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:34,559
Rym: what is with this kid and randomly flailing and then hitting buttons?

1001
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,320
Rym: So he really plot moves in this movie twice because he randomly hits a button on a wall.

1002
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:47,220
Scott: Yep, so he he accidentally turns off the Inviso radar the doctor takes care of his boa juice poisoning with a shot and then Boa fucking missiles the.

1003
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:58,329
Scott: The boat gets missled so bad that everyone on the flying ghost ship dies except for the captain who's injured the girl who's the girl the doctor and the and the main character kid.

1004
00:58:58,389 --> 00:59:01,783
Scott: everyone else in the whole ghost ship dies and it's ruined and it crashes under the Sea.

1005
00:59:02,287 --> 00:59:03,680
Scott: and that's the end of the flying ghost ship.

1006
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:05,731
Rym: so they're sitting on this ruined ghost ship.

1007
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:13,706
Scott: only four of them are alive and The captain in the go in the mask is Basically, you know out of commission.

1008
00:59:13,746 --> 00:59:20,303
Rym: so that this girl who's there is being really friendly with him and she's like we should go kamikaze On this asshole.

1009
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:27,630
Scott: Well, this isn't first right the kid that because the captain gets injured They take his mask off and the kid realizes.

1010
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,100
Scott: Oh my god, the captain of the ghost is my real dad.

1011
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:32,791
Rym: Oh, right, and he kind of looks good.

1012
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:35,120
Rym: His burns are very like avatar bird.

1013
00:59:35,263 --> 00:59:40,556
Scott: This is a purple Blotch on the whole side of his face and he's like two-faced purple and not purple.

1014
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:42,746
Rym: That's it Yeah, and he's like.

1015
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:43,671
Rym: I'm your dad.

1016
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:45,620
Rym: Okay, this is awesome.

1017
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:54,740
Rym: And then you know, the girl is like, all right Hayato We should totally go kamikaze on Boa because they gave us but they just talked about not minutes ago.

1018
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,679
Scott: how look we know that Boa's fort is here and we know it has this big star in the middle and we know that is.

1019
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:01,747
Scott: We haven't figured out any way to penetrate it.

1020
01:00:01,787 --> 01:00:05,040
Scott: We're doing everything we can possibly do to attack Boa's fort.

1021
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:07,814
Rym: And she's like we should kamikaze and the kids like but it won't work.

1022
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:08,980
Rym: and she's like, what are you a pussy?

1023
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,160
Scott: Yeah, it's like dude.

1024
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:16,020
Scott: Listen, if we knew if kamikaze would have worked before we could have done it with the in the perfectly working ghost ship.

1025
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:19,160
Scott: now You want to do it with two people and a broken ass?

1026
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,426
Scott: Missile to hell ghost.

1027
01:00:20,587 --> 01:00:23,260
Rym: or maybe they didn't want to do kamikaze because they had other options.

1028
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,091
Rym: But now that they have no options, there's no reason to not kamikaze.

1029
01:00:26,111 --> 01:00:28,580
Scott: They're gonna die anyway, so they go to kamikaze.

1030
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:37,246
Scott: The Boa with the broken ass go ship and the kid who's never piloted it before is piloting and the girl who's lived on the Ship for a while is helping.

1031
01:00:37,326 --> 01:00:38,673
Rym: the weird thing is through this whole scene.

1032
01:00:38,713 --> 01:00:39,517
Rym: She's like, let's go.

1033
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:43,420
Rym: kamikaze He's like no it won't work and she's like Ben up Nancy boy.

1034
01:00:43,862 --> 01:00:48,980
Rym: And then when they're going he she's basically like it's not gonna work and he's like man up Nancy boy.

1035
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:49,903
Scott: It's like what.

1036
01:00:50,865 --> 01:00:52,189
Rym: and they just fucking kamikaze.

1037
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:54,436
Rym: through to this like there's a pillar event.

1038
01:00:54,456 --> 01:00:55,800
Scott: That's a giant octopus, right?

1039
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,673
Scott: There's a. there's two or three obstacles.

1040
01:00:57,713 --> 01:00:58,680
Scott: they managed to escape.

1041
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,690
Rym: I think the best obstacle the octopus whatever but there's the.

1042
01:01:02,172 --> 01:01:04,620
Rym: I love the scene of the octopus robot losing his shit.

1043
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:08,006
Scott: Yeah, and no Reming itself in crane crush under a rock.

1044
01:01:08,026 --> 01:01:12,780
Scott: No, but with the undersea mines, they they fail all the undersea mines explode, but they're okay.

1045
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:16,149
Rym: Yeah, what the fuck the fact that Boa doesn't isn't like.

1046
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:20,480
Rym: why did all my mines just blow up and my robot octopus disappear?

1047
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,685
Rym: and This movie just really.

1048
01:01:24,705 --> 01:01:30,462
Scott: in the end they kamikaze and at the last second the captain shows up and says dude eject the bridge so we don't die.

1049
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:31,828
Scott: and then they do and then it's over.

1050
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:37,907
Rym: so we say it's over because I Don't even know what to say about this.

1051
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,272
Rym: So the diagram.

1052
01:01:39,373 --> 01:01:49,839
Rym: and when you see Boa's lair It is like this kind of concentric design and there's a tower with a star in the top poking out And that's what opens and closes and all the robots come in and out through there.

1053
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:53,086
Rym: They ram it and it explodes.

1054
01:01:53,246 --> 01:01:57,620
Scott: well, they ram it basically by flying this relatively tiny go ship, right?

1055
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,611
Scott: It's a big ship, but it's tiny compared to the base.

1056
01:01:59,752 --> 01:02:01,321
Rym: It is nuclear-powered or something It's

1057
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:14,880
Scott: true, but they they drive this incredibly tiny ship into Basically this club, you know slowly closing Hall and it fits through the hole at the last second sort of like, you know Yeah, you escaped from the aliens in Independence Day, you know, you fit through the closing door hatch at the last

1058
01:02:15,322 --> 01:02:15,562
Rym: Yep,

1059
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:20,060
Scott: and then they eject and then that is enough to destroy the entire base.

1060
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:25,355
Rym: Well, well, it turns out and I wish I was side of that little hole was Boa.

1061
01:02:25,777 --> 01:02:26,820
Rym: Yes, that is Boa.

1062
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,565
Rym: In fact, that wasn't a hole to Boa.

1063
01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:36,110
Rym: that was Boa because you see Boa is a giant Goddamn motherfucking clam.

1064
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:38,819
Scott: How does a giant clam or oyster?

1065
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:43,152
Scott: Make Boa juice talk to Kuroshio build robots etc.

1066
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:43,533
Scott: Etc.

1067
01:02:43,573 --> 01:02:43,974
Scott: Etc.

1068
01:02:44,054 --> 01:02:49,280
Rym: Even if it's a really giant mystical clam How the fuck it must have just been really pissed off about being a clam.

1069
01:02:49,562 --> 01:02:50,105
Scott: I don't know.

1070
01:02:50,347 --> 01:02:51,836
Rym: it died kind of the way a clam would?

1071
01:02:51,877 --> 01:02:52,360
Rym: it kind of goes?

1072
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,979
Rym: Oh, it comes out and then goes back down.

1073
01:02:55,281 --> 01:02:57,146
Scott: Yeah, and just what I mean?

1074
01:02:57,226 --> 01:03:02,260
Scott: a giant clam that big eating a ship that small like that's gonna kill it instantly.

1075
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:03,691
Rym: Let's summarize.

1076
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:08,129
Rym: There's a world Boa's trying to kill goddamn everyone.

1077
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:12,407
Rym: the ghost ship stops Goa Boa But it's too late.

1078
01:03:12,448 --> 01:03:14,320
Rym: Boa juice has killed most of the people in the world.

1079
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,671
Rym: The crabs have killed half the rest of the people.

1080
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,300
Scott: golem has killed a whole bunch of people.

1081
01:03:18,822 --> 01:03:20,028
Rym: Basically, everyone's dead.

1082
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:22,440
Rym: but then there's this epilogue or everyone's totally fine.

1083
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:29,182
Scott: Yeah I mean as soon as Boa is dead all the crab robots just stopped working immediately and the world is fine and all the buildings Are in one piece.

1084
01:03:29,243 --> 01:03:31,068
Scott: like didn't golem smash them all?

1085
01:03:31,088 --> 01:03:32,914
Rym: but maybe they were showing other places.

1086
01:03:33,014 --> 01:03:33,957
Rym: I don't know but possible.

1087
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:37,346
Rym: even so Boa was a giant clam.

1088
01:03:37,566 --> 01:03:41,360
Rym: The plot of this is that a giant clam sent robots to kill all humans.

1089
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:52,800
Scott: And then at the end is a tiny epilogue scene where the the I guess real dad who was go ship captain is totally chill And the main character and the girl are on a boat in the ocean and they're having a good old time.

1090
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,220
Rym: Oh, but poor Jack loses his bag, right?

1091
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,067
Scott: It's like the dog loses his bag full of stuff and it's like.

1092
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,660
Scott: was that supposed to be symbolic of something because I mean it could have been.

1093
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:04,087
Rym: But he lost his baggage, I guess.

1094
01:04:04,128 --> 01:04:05,512
Scott: but what was it symbolic?

1095
01:04:05,753 --> 01:04:06,816
Rym: Oh, I just felt bad for Jack.

1096
01:04:06,836 --> 01:04:07,980
Rym: Jack loses his bag.

1097
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,925
Rym: It's clearly his bag.

1098
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:09,869
Rym: He cares a lot about it.

1099
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:11,035
Rym: And the hiato is just like.

1100
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:14,428
Rym: we'll get you another bag Not much better bag be fine.

1101
01:04:14,609 --> 01:04:14,749
Scott: Yeah.

1102
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:25,105
Rym: Oh and forgot to mention, you know, not real mom's Shoe that really didn't play into it the movie at all though It's just oh it didn't.

1103
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:29,100
Scott: it was just like an excuse to have a discussion with a girl about his real parents.

1104
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,940
Rym: It's about a giant clam that tries to kill everybody.

1105
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:42,637
Scott: But I mean look it starts off with Scooby Doo then it's Astro Boy with a robot Then it's giant clam under the sea and in between it's like generic robot show.

1106
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:49,500
Scott: It's evil Businessman, it's like what the fuck dudes what the fuck giant clam?

1107
01:04:49,821 --> 01:04:50,203
Scott: They say.

1108
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:53,119
Scott: the saving grace of this movie is that it's 60 minutes.

1109
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,973
Scott: So you only what the fuck for a little while and then it's over.

1110
01:04:56,153 --> 01:05:01,794
Rym: and as the movie goes on people Increasingly make that I am angry and also confused.

1111
01:05:01,855 --> 01:05:03,180
Rym: look with the furrowed brow.

1112
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,570
Scott: So if you want 60 minutes of what the fuck?

1113
01:05:07,092 --> 01:05:07,593
Scott: why is this?

1114
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,800
Scott: five different animes barely squished together?

1115
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,964
Rym: Maybe you don't believe us.

1116
01:05:10,984 --> 01:05:12,390
Rym: You're gonna be like yeah clam.

1117
01:05:12,571 --> 01:05:14,540
Rym: It's gonna be a clam like the naked cars new tenant.

1118
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,082
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

1119
01:05:15,323 --> 01:05:16,608
Rym: Those are literally naked cars.

1120
01:05:16,808 --> 01:05:18,254
Rym: This is literally a giant clan.

1121
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:20,962
Scott: That's right flying go ship 1969.

1122
01:05:20,962 --> 01:05:27,320
Scott: I guess for 1969. it's something special and it has historical value being by Miyazaki with the key animation.

1123
01:05:27,568 --> 01:05:29,839
Rym: but Well, there's also.

1124
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:33,400
Rym: You'll watch it and are you know, it seems to move slowly.

1125
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,417
Scott: I mean like it's not good, but it's like there's something to see and get out of 55 minutes.

1126
01:05:38,421 --> 01:05:41,150
Scott: There's something to learn from watching it 55 minutes in.

1127
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:43,778
Rym: all I could think was how the fuck are they gonna resolve this in?

1128
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,123
Rym: five minutes?

1129
01:05:45,545 --> 01:05:49,802
Scott: it just doesn't have any direction or pacing or Anything.

1130
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:54,240
Scott: it's like they just took ten scenes from random anime and pasted them one after the other with the same character.

1131
01:05:54,862 --> 01:05:59,216
Scott: It's literally a giant clam giant clam giant robot scooby-doo.

1132
01:05:59,236 --> 01:06:01,866
Rym: eject the bridge And the girl.

1133
01:06:01,926 --> 01:06:04,600
Rym: just I love to see that the girl trying to convince the kid to go off.

1134
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,288
Rym: Special thanks to DJ.

1135
01:06:11,262 --> 01:06:13,514
Rym: And right, okay for the logo, right.

Scott: I'm I'm in the secret base.

1140
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:36,393
Scott: They're gonna catch me.

1141
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:40,165
Scott: No, I'm just out in the streets.

1142
01:06:40,206 --> 01:06:41,955
Scott: only chill at least a kid that me.

1143
01:06:42,056 --> 01:06:44,625
Scott: Oh my just on TV It's at least great digital target.

1144
01:06:44,946 --> 01:06:48,336
Rym: had the decency to not father showing us the giant plan.

1145
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,399
Rym: It was clearly again.

1146
01:06:50,743 --> 01:06:52,660
Scott: That was bad equally bad in a different.

1147
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,031
Rym: But would it be better if the thing had gone in and then went to credits?

1148
01:06:57,051 --> 01:06:59,237
Rym: it was like five minutes later.

1149
01:06:59,378 --> 01:07:01,883
Rym: Boa stopped Transmitting.

1150
01:07:01,903 --> 01:07:02,708
Scott: Boa was transmitting.

1151
01:07:03,009 --> 01:07:04,960
Rym: I guess how else was it controlling all those robots?

1152
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,760
Scott: I didn't explain that because the robot stopped when Boa died.

1153
01:07:08,922 --> 01:07:10,149
Scott: I'm done with the flying ghost ship.

1154
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:11,779
Scott: I got nothing more to say about it.
