1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,176
Rym: Hey, it's Wednesday, May 12th.

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:12,058
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:16,910
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight anime that Scott fell asleep watching.

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,227
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:31,660
Scott: I don't know if I discussed this, but I ordered a new laptop because the one I have I mean it's awesome.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,625
Scott: It has served me well.

7
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,800
Scott: It's still pretty great, but you know it's kind of old core solo.

8
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:38,458
Scott: I guess it's more Monday stuff, but whatever the point is already a new one.

9
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:49,040
Scott: and I also ordered of course an extra power adapter and a little you know a zipper Sleeve to put it in like you do and So Lenovo is totally a cock tease.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:57,700
Scott: They haven't finished putting together the laptop yet because I you know I customized all the parts got the SSD and everything But they shipped me the sleeve and the extra power adapter.

11
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:58,718
Scott: They showed up today at work.

12
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:03,560
Scott: So you know that's cool because I won't have to worry about signing it for signing for it when I'm not at home.

13
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,927
Scott: but The thing is right.

14
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:09,240
Scott: I take the sleeve and I put it in my laptop bag.

15
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:17,697
Scott: It sort of sticks out about a couple inches You know because this thing is like a 10.2 inch sort of widescreen, but the one the laptop.

16
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:20,910
Scott: I got is like a 12 inch Squarish screen.

17
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:21,940
Rym: see that's the trouble.

18
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:28,615
Rym: It's like it's an ultra portable technically But it's still bigger than like the tiny tiny laptops that we really like.

19
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,853
Rym: you know what I want is I'm willing to pay for it a crazy powerful laptop.

20
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:34,200
Rym: That is the size of a netbook.

21
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:37,720
Scott: Yeah, the thing is right, so what am I gonna do about this bag?

22
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,704
Scott: I can't get a new bag.

23
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:42,720
Rym: this bag is like the awesome, but you could get the bigger version of that bag.

24
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,820
Scott: That's too big and I'm not gonna replace this bag.

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,386
Rym: I gotta find some other bag.

26
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:51,039
Rym: gotta find some other custom place that makes bags and get them to make like.

27
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:59,125
Scott: I Don't want to get another custom bag to replace my expensive custom bag that is in perfect working or you can go ultra custom find Like a tailor.

28
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:05,776
Rym: you know someone who makes bags and be like look I want you to make me a bag for me to carry this list of items.

29
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:06,660
Rym: here are the items.

30
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:11,280
Rym: Uh-huh, you know spend like a thousand dollars and get like the perfect, okay?

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,303
Scott: And then what happens?

32
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:16,660
Scott: why I get another laptop a few years or now you have money and you do the whole thing again.

33
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:24,125
Scott: No, I'm not buying a new bag Another laptop yeah anyway So that that was your day.

34
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:24,848
Rym: that was your exciting.

35
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:26,916
Scott: that was just annoying that I put this.

36
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:30,505
Scott: you know I'm like ah fuck I can't close my bag all the way really sorta.

37
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:35,795
Rym: yep, not really a to our Wednesday thing either, but I Just bought an Xbox.

38
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:36,737
Scott: all right.

39
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,783
Scott: basically watch some animes on it.

40
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:41,030
Rym: I guess it's a Street Fighter 4 machine.

41
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:42,395
Scott: No, there's some other stuff.

42
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:43,520
Scott: We'll play some Tecmo Bowl.

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,403
Rym: We will we will.

44
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:46,090
Scott: we can play Castle Crashers remote.

45
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:48,690
Rym: I mean my policy is still going to be anytime.

46
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,910
Rym: There's a game that I could get on the Xbox that I could also get on the PC.

47
00:02:54,572 --> 00:03:00,147
Rym: And if I don't care about not being able to play with Xbox people on the PC PC 100% really see.

48
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:01,210
Scott: my policy is similar.

49
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,002
Scott: However my policy is this I will get the game for Xbox if it is a game I want to play with controllers on the TV.

50
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:09,069
Scott: I will get the game on the PC.

51
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:09,708
Scott: What's the game?

52
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,176
Scott: I want to play with the mouse and a keyboard.

53
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:16,889
Rym: the thing is if I get even if I get a game on the PC I'm gonna have an HD PC That's fast enough to play my steam games.

54
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:18,540
Rym: And I got a USB.

55
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,136
Scott: my h2 thing is the HD PC I have is you know fast enough.

56
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,380
Scott: the thing is right.

57
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,141
Scott: take this for example, okay, so Street Fighter 4 right yeah the home theater BC can totally do it.

58
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:35,266
Scott: the thing is is The home theater PC wants to do a vertical sync at 1080, but you know 1080p at 60 Hertz.

59
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:44,279
Scott: Yeah, right the Xbox to the 1080p doesn't do 60 Hertz But it vertical sinks at a lower hurt.

60
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:45,142
Scott: right.

61
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:48,106
Rym: so just get a more powerful HD PC.

62
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:50,916
Scott: No The thing is the HD PC right.

63
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:56,289
Scott: the graphics that it makes it 60 Hertz are way better than the ones the 360 makes cuz It's so much more powerful.

64
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:00,002
Scott: But I can't get it to vertical sync at a lower hurt cuz.

65
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:04,569
Scott: then I had to get the TV to go to a lower You know vertical refresh rate, and that doesn't happen.

66
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:08,074
Rym: I'm sure you come up with something But I guess I saw.

67
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:14,925
Scott: the problem is is that it looks better when I play Street Fighter 4 on the PC But it gets a little bit air because there's no vertical sync.

68
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:15,969
Scott: and you get the scan line.

69
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,377
Scott: well I think the operative, but if I plan the 360 is just perfect But the graphics are less quality.

70
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:27,848
Rym: the operative point there is just that with an HD PC There's a little more fiddling involved in everything and you'll never get it just working like an Xbox will.

71
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:28,210
Rym: yeah.

72
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:38,329
Scott: The other thing is that most of the games that I can play on the TV right with the Xbox the multiplayer action is gonna Be on Xbox Live and not as much on games for Windows Live.

73
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,584
Rym: yeah However, you're not gonna play a Civ 5 on an Xbox.

74
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,530
Rym: if you'll even be on I don't think it'll be on the Xbox.

75
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,294
Rym: I have no idea.

76
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:47,605
Rym: Yeah supreme commanders on there.

77
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,610
Rym: I can't imagine how that works.

78
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:53,370
Rym: Yeah, I would never buy that for like Left 4 Dead it always all my co-workers have Left 4 Dead.

79
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,215
Rym: I would have played with them.

80
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:55,743
Rym: They all have it on the Xbox.

81
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:56,326
Rym: What's the fuck?

82
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:56,909
Scott: I don't know.

83
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:59,228
Rym: I don't know I I just can't imagine that.

84
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:04,910
Rym: But it's Wednesday, and we're not gonna review it yet because obviously it's still coming out.

85
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,817
Rym: But I'm watching the door our.

86
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:08,804
Rym: uh it's pretty fucking awesome.

87
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:09,426
Rym: It's all right.

88
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:10,390
Rym: I've kind of blown.

89
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,019
Scott: I think I finished watching Captain Harlock.

90
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:18,748
Scott: I'm now watching that 13 episode Co-production with PBS the Phoenix.

91
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,673
Scott: Oh Jessica Phoenix.

92
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:21,637
Scott: yeah, I forgot.

93
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:22,620
Scott: you know I just didn't watch it.

94
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,705
Scott: when it's I'm watching it now.

95
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:25,110
Rym: that had a good opener.

96
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,423
Rym: I recall like I like the opener.

97
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:28,352
Scott: yeah That's it.

98
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:28,814
Rym: Yeah.

99
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,140
Rym: I don't know Dora.

100
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:36,430
Rym: We'll do a show on it as soon as it's all out because Obviously, there's some sort of twist coming at the end like some big things gonna happen.

101
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,659
Scott: Watch nothing happens.

102
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,029
Rym: Yeah, it just kind of stops.

103
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:41,633
Scott: That'd be cool.

104
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:42,899
Rym: I don't know it.

105
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,823
Rym: You were right though.

106
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,470
Rym: one Scott predicted something.

107
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,009
Rym: We're not gonna spoil anything that I did not predict.

108
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:53,545
Rym: I Realized it probably like I don't know two minutes before in the course of the show.

109
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:54,729
Rym: it was revealed straight up.

110
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,885
Scott: I did it in like episode two.

111
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:59,160
Rym: yeah That was one of those meta predictions.

112
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,427
Rym: like me and Alex's D&D games He introduces the character, and I'm like that guy's clearly the whole villain for this whole campaign.

113
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:09,770
Rym: Alex wrote No, no, but there is some news.

114
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:14,305
Rym: Scott's gonna tell me that this is old news because he knew about it, but I didn't know.

115
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:22,959
Rym: I don't pay attention to Philly Wizard world or well, I guess star wizard world basically wizard world right is a you know wizard magazine Which is right?

116
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:28,930
Scott: They like they had some conventions and they reworked them and they rescheduled them.

117
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,130
Scott: No,

118
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:45,630
Rym: no wizard world conventions are comic conventions in the older school sense so they seem to be trying to Appeal to the demographic that goes to like SDCC in that they bring like movie actors and kind of all these Ancillary pop culture things just trying to get a bunch of bodies there.

119
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:54,821
Rym: But the majority of the bodies there other than those kind of pop culture people who get sucked in are Dudes looking for silver age fucking spider-man, and that is all they want.

120
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:59,860
Rym: they got the little rolly-wheelie bag filled with all I remember looking for the new Green Lantern.

121
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,890
Scott: ish shit that they love those nodes.

122
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,394
Rym: But the same kind of people.

123
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:06,564
Rym: they're going primarily to buy comics and pay for autographs.

124
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:18,382
Scott: Yep, so anyway the These conventions like they've kept reworking them and moving them and they close some in some cities and opened up in other cities and Whatever and they keep doing a whole bunch of stuff.

125
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:33,710
Scott: and basically their new strategy Which well, it's just not so new Rym Just discovered it recently is that they basically when there's a big comic convention in town They have their comic convention at the same day same weekend as the big one and their logic is okay.

126
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,939
Scott: If we just have our Scott.

127
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:36,470
Rym: we're talking about comic cons.

128
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,920
Rym: You could have said same bat time same bat play okay, whatever.

129
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:43,350
Scott: so you could have their their strategy here, right?

130
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,734
Scott: You think that's a stupid strategy.

131
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:46,139
Scott: who's gonna go to their convention?

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,102
Scott: right if there's another better bigger one in town and the thing is Okay, so let's say the newer comic-con right.

133
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:56,180
Scott: a ton of people show up for that shit Especially since it's now combined with the New York Anime Festival.

134
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,168
Scott: It is a mega double con alrighty.

135
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:04,751
Scott: So now if they just had it on their own weekend in New York some people would show up Maybe.

136
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:09,508
Scott: but if they have it on that weekend that bigger convention is is so big.

137
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,661
Scott: It's drawing people from a wider geographical area to come into New York.

138
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:23,270
Scott: those people wouldn't come into New York from Massachusetts Or Pennsylvania for the wizard con especially because there's a wizard con probably near them at some other point in maybe.

139
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,950
Scott: But even if not it's not a big enough con to draw from such a large area.

140
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:34,169
Scott: It pretty much only draw the Manhattan nerds right so or the New York City nerds And maybe a slight maybe some northern Jersey nerds too, right?

141
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:54,467
Scott: But if this is bigger con in town that draws this big geographical area worth of people into the city and there happens to be Another nerd con down the road that is within you know ten five ten minute walking distance They're hoping that they can actually get more people to come to their con than would otherwise Because the mega nerds will go to both cons.

142
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:59,328
Scott: now They get a few key like guests to go to their con instead of the New York comic-con or whatever.

143
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:02,825
Scott: the other Con in town happens to be in the other city that they're doing this in.

144
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:09,308
Scott: and You know I just got to go see this guest, so I'll go buy a badge to the other con also.

145
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:15,068
Rym: now I don't see this working so well at least in this New York situation because one I know we couldn't figure out.

146
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,196
Rym: I actually look In the map to see where the hell this thing was.

147
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,273
Rym: the only convention center in New York City is the Javits Which is not.

148
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:22,358
Rym: it's big.

149
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:29,890
Rym: like it's one of those convention centers that can only be used for Gigantic gigantic events and like it's the kind of thing that like the New York Auto Show is in there.

150
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:36,130
Rym: You know giant show floors Tens and tens and tens and thousands of people hundreds of thousands of people over the course of a weekend.

151
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,647
Rym: You know big iron big deal stuff.

152
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,136
Rym: Where the hell are they gonna have their comic-con?

153
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:44,030
Rym: and apparently they're like 20 blocks north of the Javits.

154
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:48,401
Scott: I thought they were like 10 15 blocks Depends on where you count the Javits.

155
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,498
Rym: the Javits span as many blocks But it is at like 50 something.

156
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:56,370
Rym: it's Street at Pier F uptown which isn't that far.

157
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,836
Rym: It's probably like a 20-minute walk.

158
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,146
Scott: Yeah, it's not like there's no crosstown action.

159
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:01,110
Scott: It's just straight north base.

160
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,652
Rym: However, it's straight north through an area of Manhattan that for those of you who aren't from New York It's basically empty.

161
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:12,190
Rym: there aren't even hobos out there, nor are there pigeons because there's nothing for the pigeons.

162
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,917
Scott: It's basically just a concrete walk.

163
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:15,081
Rym: There's nothing.

164
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:15,945
Rym: There's no transit.

165
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:17,310
Scott: You're lucky if there's a street vendor.

166
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,670
Scott: There's usually one outside the Javits.

167
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:23,202
Scott: So anime con goers generally more energetic, you know running around.

168
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,575
Scott: They're not going to the wizard con.

169
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:29,122
Rym: They're not going anywhere near that thing.

170
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:30,730
Rym: There's probably nothing in the world.

171
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,517
Scott: They might go up there.

172
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:37,883
Scott: They want to see up there comic nerd guys one at least demographically.

173
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,330
Rym: I don't think have that much money.

174
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,726
Rym: I don't know if they're gonna pay 50 bucks to get into two conventions.

175
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:47,030
Scott: It's weird I think that there's like a huge spread in terms of how much money the common people have right?

176
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,195
Scott: It's like you get some people.

177
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:51,330
Scott: it's like they love comics so much, but they have a very little money.

178
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:54,470
Scott: So every month they just buy spider-man for like four bucks and that's it.

179
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:58,968
Scott: And then there's the guys who are like his 20 G's give me that silver server number one.

180
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:01,303
Scott: Oh, yeah Oh shit, the quality is not high enough.

181
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:02,249
Scott: I need to trade up.

182
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:10,030
Scott: I will sell you this silver server number one and give you five thousand dollars for that mint or condition silver server number one.

183
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,097
Scott: Those guys those guys exist, right?

184
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:19,760
Scott: So the thing is I will pay $500 for my con badge, so it's a VIP badge so I can skip all the lines.

185
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:22,320
Rym: Yeah, they I think they both have that sort of stuff going on.

186
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,739
Rym: but yeah, the tricky part is without transit short of taking a cab.

187
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:31,488
Rym: a Stereotypical comic book guy now there are exceptions is fat.

188
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:38,618
Rym: a stereotypical one might be carrying a lot of comic books is not gonna make it To that other con let alone back.

189
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:44,880
Scott: They might do one site name, you know, these people are just the kind of people were diving in the bins to buy stuff.

190
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:48,340
Scott: They're not going to the panels, you know, they're not doing all the other stuff, right?

191
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,585
Scott: They go to one.

192
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,980
Scott: they hit up all the bins sad Friday.

193
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,623
Scott: They go to the other.

194
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,651
Scott: one hit all the bins Saturday and they go home.

195
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:58,246
Scott: then maybe they hit them both on Sunday You know, maybe they go home.

196
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:08,660
Rym: Who knows see now if that if Wizard World were smart I don't want to give them good ideas because I'll be pretty much straight up, you know We're in the New York comic-con New York anime festival camp at this point.

197
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,603
Rym: We're gonna be there at both, you know same day and everything doing a bunch of panels all the kind of stuff We usually do.

198
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:16,051
Rym: it's read expositions.

199
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:19,237
Rym: We work with them on stuff positions expositions.

200
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,945
Rym: So we're not going anywhere near Wizard World and I guess unless they let us in free and they send us a car or something I don't know.

201
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:30,574
Scott: Why would I go there if I were them?

202
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:41,330
Rym: I Would set up and pay for a shuttle and I'd get a dealer's table at the read-con and Basically be like but they could refuse to give them the table.

203
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,226
Rym: they could I don't know if they would and also the Javits Unions law rules.

204
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:49,120
Scott: They might not be allowed to have a shuttle to go to a competing event like that.

205
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:52,495
Rym: Yeah, I would set the shuttle up, you know on the public street right there.

206
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:53,600
Rym: You can do that with New York City.

207
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:57,780
Rym: I guess I would set something up have a shuttle back and forth all day.

208
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,306
Scott: You could probably rent the Chinatown bus.

209
00:12:59,326 --> 00:12:59,848
Scott: make them do it.

210
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:05,780
Rym: and what I would do is I would offer to You know Nick Niaf, they probably wouldn't accept it.

211
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,663
Rym: But then I would just do it.

212
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:13,332
Rym: anyone my own anyone who comes to my con wizard con with a New York anime festival comic-con Badge gets 50% off the badge.

213
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,806
Rym: Hey, yeah, that's what I would do.

214
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:21,360
Scott: You basically making your it's like hey, we'll make a you know leech con.

215
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:23,670
Scott: It's like well, there's nothing this beat.

216
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,119
Scott: Let's just make a leech event.

217
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:36,200
Scott: It's like if there's a music concert and I have a concert that has nothing to do with them an hour before that Concert starts and I say if you got tickets to the big concert you can get into my concert for a dollar.

218
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:46,940
Rym: You know, what's funny is that this is the sort of thing that Unnamed staff at certain anime conventions we work with will say, you know Reed they always say yeah Reed's trying to destroy us.

219
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:50,452
Rym: They always try to like steal all our stuff and steal our secrets.

220
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:52,860
Rym: that the how to run, you know, poorly managed cons.

221
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:54,525
Scott: But yeah, they want your secret.

222
00:13:54,545 --> 00:14:00,160
Rym: so bad the anime con staff are so afraid of Reed and yet Reed doesn't do the shady stuff.

223
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:01,719
Rym: It's wizard world doing the shade.

224
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,592
Scott: But wizard world is not something to be afraid of now.

225
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:08,068
Rym: because we went to Philly wizard world Let me tell you many years ago.

226
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:12,888
Rym: I walked around trying to interview people at that thing and It was amazing.

227
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:16,644
Rym: one people were afraid of the microphone like, you know I or even without the microphone.

228
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:20,880
Rym: it started hiding it because when I headed out or my press badge people would like stay away from.

229
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:33,184
Rym: But if I hit it and I just talked to a random person They seemed aghast that I had said anything to them and the only person who consented to be interviewed Basically talked at length about how they were there to buy Silver Age spider-man.

230
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,592
Rym: they had a list of silver age spider-man comics they needed.

231
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,347
Rym: they spent all day looking for them and then they went home.

232
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:39,284
Scott: Mm-hmm.

233
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:52,192
Rym: It's a different experience But yeah I'll take this opportunity to to point out that the New York anime festival comic-con is October 7th 8th and 9th Or sorry 8th 9th and 10th in New York City.

234
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:54,720
Rym: Manhattan will be there if you want to see us.

235
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:02,907
Rym: We'll be doing awesome stuff And now that we live in the city We will probably be able to hang out pretty late and not you know Any of you tried to see.

236
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:08,215
Rym: it's the New York anime festival last year might have remembered that We appeared did our panels and then like the wind.

237
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,687
Rym: Yep None of that anymore.

238
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:11,895
Rym: We're gonna be there all three days.

239
00:15:12,257 --> 00:15:16,480
Rym: Yep Okay, so how's that anime industry doing?

240
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:21,579
Scott: Oh, it's doing just as well as it's always been doing for the past X years, which is horribly bad.

241
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,120
Scott: So what was it like 2002 when the anime boom was like, so this isn't animated is manga related?

242
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,888
Scott: So Viz has laid off 60 people.

243
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:30,831
Scott: they closed their knee.

244
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:33,620
Scott: They closed their New York branch, which is five people.

245
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:40,200
Scott: They laid off 55 people at their headquarters in San Francisco, and we've determined that they have 90 people remaining.

246
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:44,016
Scott: Right, so actually that's pretty impressive to have 90 people, right?

247
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:44,860
Scott: That's a lot of people.

248
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:46,890
Rym: What do they need those 90 people for?

249
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:47,735
Rym: is what I wonder?

250
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:51,500
Scott: yeah, I mean well I mean Viz does publish a lot of stuff, you know.

251
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:54,860
Scott: And they said ahem and this is from the animated news network.

252
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:58,780
Scott: Obviously be assured Viz media remains connected to its obligations to you.

253
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,514
Scott: They have no plans this time for drastic measures such as product cancellations or business line closures.

254
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,420
Scott: your favorite series are not going away.

255
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:09,660
Scott: So as long as they finish like 20th century boys in Bocorano, it's all good, right?

256
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,020
Scott: I mean you reading anything else from Viz?

257
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:20,140
Rym: What's so sad is that four kids reported I think 3.5 million dollars in losses.

258
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:20,864
Scott: Well, that's a good.

259
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:25,948
Scott: four kids mostly made their money by getting shows like, you know One piece of whatever get out on TV and butchering.

260
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:27,754
Scott: nobody's putting them on TV anymore.

261
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:29,460
Scott: So, of course, why did four kids?

262
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,027
Scott: I'm surprised they're still in business.

263
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:32,735
Scott: I know but what business are they doing?

264
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:33,539
Rym: What amazes me is?

265
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,928
Rym: All right, 3.5 million dollars in losses.

266
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:38,197
Rym: the fuck are they doing with 3.5 million dollars?

267
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:43,172
Rym: I could have made an entire company and put out an anime.

268
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,177
Scott: Yeah, what are they spending that money on?

269
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:52,000
Rym: I mean Well, they apparently they got 12 properties now and they're how many of those are on TV?

270
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:56,568
Rym: They're gonna put them all on TV They have a new TV block and they're basically spending all this money.

271
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:02,324
Rym: for here's my non educated non insider personal opinion Not based on anything.

272
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:03,648
Rym: I have a no secret or whatever.

273
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:07,900
Rym: I think four kids is gonna have this last gasp and then they're gone.

274
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:10,740
Scott: Yeah, I mean wasn't someone gonna buy them or something?

275
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:17,060
Rym: They said recently that they have a buyer possibly lined up or that someone expressed interest in buying them.

276
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:19,054
Rym: I think they're on the way out.

277
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:19,618
Rym: I think they're done.

278
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:20,828
Scott: Well, what?

279
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:21,252
Scott: what are?

280
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:21,997
Scott: if I you know?

281
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:29,240
Scott: I mean if I just had that the money that they lost which means that they had it and spent it right because you can't Have a loss if you didn't have the money to begin with, right?

282
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:39,247
Scott: So if I had three and a half million dollars and my and I had to basically be in the anime business I could buy one anime that was guaranteed to be a hit market.

283
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:44,693
Scott: it make it a hit and Make a profit and then I would just repeat over and over again.

284
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:46,780
Scott: And I how could I fail at that?

285
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,431
Scott: I know what shows are gonna be a hit.

286
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:48,975
Rym: Also.

287
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:49,720
Rym: Look at those three.

288
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,906
Scott: I would just buy Dora.

289
00:17:50,986 --> 00:18:06,710
Rym: I win if I was running one of these, you know anime companies or manga companies which I still believe the main reason there are so many problems in this so-called industry is that By and large everyone involved in it is just terribly unprofessional Like surprisingly so.

290
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,960
Rym: but why do they need all these employees?

291
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:23,307
Rym: I would have the tiniest footprint ever and I would literally outsource everything, you know I'd have a shell company a couple of employees You know doing sales and all the kind of basic stuff and every time we wanted a new property We'd get it and then I would basically Contract people to translate.

292
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:25,576
Rym: if I needed to dub I'd contract people to dub.

293
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:26,500
Rym: it would be nothing.

294
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,407
Scott: Well, if you're five your viz right.

295
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,415
Scott: so viz 90 people that's what we're talking about.

296
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:32,342
Scott: Yeah, so viz does manga Okay.

297
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:37,260
Scott: So first I basically need someone to go and get the licenses to things.

298
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,540
Scott: But this doesn't need that because viz basically has a lock on the licenses.

299
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,517
Rym: You needed that get like, you know a 10 person team plus a lawyer and that's it.

300
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:45,240
Scott: All right.

301
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,567
Scott: So, okay, so you get the licenses which viz already has.

302
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:55,031
Scott: Yeah, you need translating you need printing you need Marketing and then you need to actually everything but marketing.

303
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,820
Rym: you can just contract out every time you have a new property.

304
00:18:58,122 --> 00:18:59,631
Rym: There's no reason keeping people around.

305
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,160
Scott: quality doesn't matter.

306
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,096
Scott: the only thing you need quality on is like the the book cover designs and stuff like that.

307
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:09,385
Scott: so you hire what like one or two awesome designers and Everything else like.

308
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:10,108
Scott: okay.

309
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:13,180
Scott: Yes that you you should have high quality translations.

310
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,599
Scott: You're gonna sell the same number with or without let's be honest here, right?

311
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,487
Scott: And even the translations good enough.

312
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:19,109
Scott: small staff.

313
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:29,908
Rym: you keep like what like a head of translations you basically keep one or two awesome people for each division or each like part of the business process and They're the ones who oversee the contract.

314
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:32,458
Scott: you have like one HR person who's also the office manager.

315
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:35,113
Scott: Yep, and What I mean, what do you need?

316
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:35,820
Scott: an accountant?

317
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:40,617
Scott: You know, I guess you could probably run it with less than 20 people.

318
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:41,473
Scott: the whole thing I think.

319
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:47,489
Scott: so I think easily so and outsource everything else for wicked cheap like, you know You wouldn't get some interns up ends.

320
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:53,940
Rym: You might not necessarily be super profitable But I think you could have a business that may make more money than they're making because you have less employees.

321
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,892
Scott: 3.5 million dollars Kids is the one with three and a half million dollars.

322
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:00,600
Scott: Yeah, my biz you're getting a mixed up here.

323
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,603
Scott: You can't be doing that.

324
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:03,269
Rym: how much money is making though?

325
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,031
Scott: We don't know.

326
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:05,476
Rym: Yeah, that's the other problem.

327
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:06,560
Rym: None of these companies are public.

328
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,583
Scott: Yeah, well, you know, that's how it is.

329
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,898
Rym: So things of the day.

330
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:20,200
Rym: What do you got for me Scott?

331
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,050
Scott: It's basically it's just this funky animation called love and theft.

332
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:30,890
Scott: It's seven minutes long and it's just so Frickin funky and awesome and you should watch it.

333
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:37,773
Scott: probably it's it's a. it's like a much better thing if you watch it like full screen or Like on your TV full screen or something.

334
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:42,451
Scott: just because the way it is If you watch it in a little YouTube window, it won't be as quite as cool.

335
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:44,858
Scott: So it's just an animation.

336
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,069
Scott: It's fun I like it.

337
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:47,737
Scott: That's it.

338
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:52,720
Rym: Well, I'm glad you have something good because this isn't the best thing in the world.

339
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,511
Rym: but I think it's cool because I would actually like to see this.

340
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,519
Rym: just for the sense of scale.

341
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:13,812
Rym: a life-size bust of Ava zero one was made in Japan or is in the process of being made some amusement park near Mount Fuji and it's basically that scene where Shinji, you know sees Ava one for the first time and It's life-size, but only the top of it and I don't know.

342
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:14,757
Rym: I think that's pretty cool.

343
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:15,420
Scott: That's all right.

344
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,168
Scott: There's a big thing going on over there.

345
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:18,971
Scott: It's like it's weird.

346
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,000
Scott: It's like they can't get people to watch.

347
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:24,349
Scott: You know, it wasn't like Mike tool talking about this anime Boston.

348
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:25,011
Scott: how like.

349
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:28,060
Scott: they can't get people to like, you know watch animes.

350
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:31,604
Scott: But then again, there's like this huge Nostalgia, right?

351
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,980
Scott: So when they make a big life-size Gundam statue like a zillion people show up.

352
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:42,898
Rym: Yeah, if they build stuff about nobody goes to on TV to watch anything, you know, I don't know of course Is it not the same way in America?

353
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:43,080
Rym: look?

354
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,880
Rym: 26,000 nerds will go to Otakon including us and have an awesome time, but none of those people buy or watch.

355
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,369
Scott: General public goes to see the giant Gundam robot.

356
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:59,449
Scott: Yeah, but the same general public that might have memories of Gundam But they're not watching new Gundam double-o, right?

357
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:01,656
Rym: Of course Gundam double-o wasn't that good.

358
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:02,198
Scott: I don't know.

359
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:02,800
Scott: I didn't watch it.

360
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,907
Rym: I watched the first one episode.

361
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:05,650
Rym: I wasn't impressed.

362
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,420
Scott: I mean the thing is I watched the first one episode and it was Gundam.

363
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:12,300
Rym: I mean it was yeah, well, it's tricky because the first four episodes of any Gundam are the same thing.

364
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:19,170
Rym: Yeah, so before we get on to the main bit We got the meta moment that we forget to do every now and then.

365
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:25,600
Rym: but we're remembering now quite often book club is still cosmos The coding club is still project Dorf and I imagine will be for a while.

366
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:28,092
Rym: We're gonna be at the New York Comic Con New York Anime Festival.

367
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:31,560
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX East PAX West Connecticut, yep, Connecticut.

368
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,977
Rym: Okay, not much else going on right now.

369
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:39,053
Scott: That's all I got.

370
00:22:39,073 --> 00:22:41,241
Scott: That's oh there's that you stream is happening.

371
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:41,763
Scott: All right.

372
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:42,024
Rym: Yeah.

373
00:22:42,104 --> 00:22:43,369
Rym: Well, we should probably talking like this.

374
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:49,616
Rym: second Yeah, we're streaming the video of us doing the show live Mostly as a promotional tool.

375
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:50,941
Rym: I'll tell you straight up reason.

376
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:59,557
Scott: It's a promotional tool is because people who go to you stream Hopefully will you know see Oh GeekNights is live now and maybe some new people who don't know about us We'll find us on you stream.

377
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:01,450
Scott: That's pretty much the the idea.

378
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,570
Rym: Yeah It's literally just a camera from a different angle every now and then showing the studio and how we actually record the show.

379
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,939
Rym: So it's a lot like watching Howard Stern.

380
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,763
Rym: He sits there.

381
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:12,007
Rym: There's a microphone in his face.

382
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:14,400
Rym: Yep It's not exciting to watch.

383
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,609
Rym: so I wouldn't necessarily Recommend that you bother with it.

384
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:21,390
Rym: I guess the only thing it really has going is that one there is the chat room.

385
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,167
Rym: So I guess you could talk to other listeners about it if you wanted to.

386
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:28,770
Scott: in real time You also see a few minutes of stuff that doesn't make the show.

387
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:36,187
Rym: So yep, like when we stop recording and do stuff and when we try to figure out what to do the show on Usually get to see what I were to work.

388
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:37,956
Rym: That's exciting.

389
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:45,054
Rym: I guess okay right now You can see the fact that the door on the closet in the studio fell and it's kind of Hang in there.

390
00:23:45,094 --> 00:23:46,763
Scott: Yeah, you pay us so much money for this apartment.

391
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:47,949
Scott: They can't even have doors that work.

392
00:23:48,363 --> 00:23:58,008
Rym: Yeah well the thing is and people in apartments like this from what I can tell actually Tend to take all the fixtures out and put them in storage buy their own fancy fixtures and install them.

393
00:23:58,529 --> 00:23:59,995
Rym: Mm-hmm I I'm cheap.

394
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:00,900
Rym: I didn't bother with that.

395
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,829
Rym: So I have the plain white generic fixtures.

396
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,835
Scott: Anyway, yep.

397
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:05,779
Rym: So back to the show.

398
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,970
Rym: We were trying to come up with something to review.

399
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:09,529
Rym: I mean Scott's watching a bunch of anime.

400
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:15,210
Rym: I'm watching a bunch but we haven't both finished in anime together recently and Dora was not done yet.

401
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:16,618
Rym: So I don't want to talk about it now.

402
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:18,750
Scott: I mean for all I know we don't want to do repeat shows.

403
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,754
Rym: There's a tiny chance.

404
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:20,798
Rym: It's gonna pull a gonzo

405
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:28,471
Scott: maybe but anyway, the thing is is that I said hey We should do a show cuz we watched a ton of anime back in the day, right tons We're

406
00:24:28,492 --> 00:24:30,382
Rym: talking RIT days when we would you

407
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:39,817
Scott: know, you know even older than that, too but I watched a ton of anime back in the day and we really never did shows on most of it because Mostly because we haven't rewatched it.

408
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:41,021
Scott: So we barely remember it.

409
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:43,109
Scott: So there's not that much to say about them.

410
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:50,101
Scott: and at the same time You know we well basically we.

411
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:54,557
Rym: these are shows that we liked back in the day But I forgot that I had watched.

412
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:58,190
Rym: in fact, I forgot they existed because you know, I'm so hard up for anime.

413
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,783
Rym: now I mean, there's good anime like Dora and there's old good stuff.

414
00:25:01,803 --> 00:25:03,490
Rym: I haven't finished yet like Hokuto no Ken.

415
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:09,689
Rym: But while I'm watching all of those I'll totally forget about a show like saber fucking marionette J.

416
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,658
Scott: I just remembered it two seconds ago.

417
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:16,139
Scott: Yeah, and don't ask me what I remember about it I remember that it's a show and it exists.

418
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:18,330
Rym: So we didn't know what did the show honor like?

419
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,374
Rym: Yeah, what anime?

420
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:23,352
Rym: if we both watch maybe we should show on like some anime that we haven't finished yet I don't know.

421
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:28,849
Rym: and then I was thinking about coup and then I thought about anime that we haven't watched in a long time.

422
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:35,452
Rym: and Suddenly, you know when you have a memory and you tug on that little string and suddenly you remember all these things that just weren't In your mind,

423
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:49,386
Scott: so if we only have like one minute worth of stuff to talk about any individual one of these shows Let's just remember a whole bunch of these old shows and then we can Make one show about all of them together because there's no way we're gonna rewatch all these things.

424
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:54,890
Rym: So a disclaimer We may or may not have remembered these shows as being good.

425
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:57,499
Rym: That was a long time ago.

426
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,998
Rym: they may not be good now, in fact I don't remember the characters names from half of these.

427
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,754
Rym: I don't remember hardly anything which is scary because some of them I watched Almost all the way through.

428
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,199
Scott: Yeah, that's scary.

429
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,530
Rym: Are we gonna be this way with like Hokuto no Ken 20 years from now?

430
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,527
Rym: No, no, no, maybe these shows really weren't that good as a result.

431
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:16,110
Rym: I don't know.

432
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:23,665
Rym: What's weird is some of these shows now that I remember them were Stupidly popular at the anime club back in the RIT days.

433
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:28,464
Rym: like everyone's marathoned him everyone talked about him all the time and I don't remember shit about him.

434
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:37,070
Scott: I Barely, I remember like the barest of details about any of these things But I can still probably talk for each one about each one for a few minutes.

435
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:49,595
Rym: It's almost there's like this curve where a show that is great like you remember forever It's like at the top of your cube and then on the far end shows that are really bad like Odeon are So bad or

436
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:50,940
Scott: that you don't forget them or

437
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,069
Rym: shows like this is the North Star that are so bad and so good Simultaneously that they're better than good.

438
00:26:56,733 --> 00:27:02,601
Rym: Like all those shows are kind of like and around this crater like in the Rym They're very high up there and memorable our.

439
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:04,810
Rym: I am like the Rym of the crater.

440
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:11,426
Rym: So the Rym of job, yeah, that was a clever joke right there you had coming out.

441
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:12,750
Rym: that was fantastic.

442
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:14,538
Rym: I think you could have made a better joke.

443
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,230
Rym: You should have made a goatee joke, you know Rym's craters of gaping.

444
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:22,316
Scott: It was a slam dunk Dunk.

445
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:23,001
Rym: it's so big.

446
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:23,687
Scott: I broke the Rym.

447
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:38,690
Rym: So everything around the Rym of this crater is awesome or memorable in some way most Memorable, but then in the middle are all the shows that you watch just because everyone else is watching it.

448
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:45,079
Rym: I mean, I remember this whole era of anime when like I'm trying to remember the Nate like Ravemaster and all that stuff was coming on.

449
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:45,863
Scott: that was later on.

450
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:48,498
Scott: that was like the Full Metal Panic days Yes, but those like.

451
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,070
Rym: Ravemaster was not a good show but Everyone was watching it.

452
00:27:52,730 --> 00:28:02,290
Scott: Rave master was a kid with a big sword that looked like Final Fantasy 7 and he had this cute monster friend and like the First episode was like hey, there's something going on here and it was a little bit cute and funny.

453
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,421
Scott: So I watched like 10 episodes.

454
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:05,406
Scott: then at a tenth episode.

455
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:06,050
Scott: I was like, huh?

456
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:09,970
Scott: This fight has been going on for seven episodes.

457
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:12,770
Rym: That was back before we could tell that a show was just a fighting.

458
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:18,178
Scott: I didn't even realize it cuz I'm just sitting there watching these short, you know, and I was like, oh shit I got what the fuck is this show?

459
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,826
Rym: I mean Naruto did that to us.

460
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:20,630
Rym: I was like, this is awesome.

461
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,118
Scott: This is four episodes of Naruto.

462
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,225
Scott: awesome ninja school.

463
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:27,170
Scott: This is so hilarious But it took me like most funny ninja school ever.

464
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:35,114
Scott: It took me like ten episodes episode 13 of Naruto that fight against the guy with the big sword Ten episodes.

465
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:39,429
Scott: I've been watching one fight ever since like episode six and done with this.

466
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:43,010
Rym: Yep, so these are not obscure shows.

467
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:52,470
Rym: They're just shows that I don't know if too many people remember and I imagine it would be harder to find some of these Than it would to be finding really old really obscure.

468
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:55,986
Scott: The difficulty of finding these varies greatly.

469
00:28:56,087 --> 00:29:00,490
Rym: Yes, right We got to start right up though with one that is actually as far as I can tell difficult to find.

470
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,690
Rym: I never actually saw it but coo.

471
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:05,930
Scott: So there's a so in the RIT anime club, right?

472
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:10,008
Scott: They had a library of VHS tapes and we have found that they are in good hands because we met.

473
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:15,164
Scott: the newest Librarian of the RIT anime club at anime bar was an anime Bostoner packs.

474
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:20,013
Scott: It was the same buildings Boston.

475
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:24,708
Scott: so we met him there and you know, we got we figured everything out with him and it's in good hands.

476
00:29:24,748 --> 00:29:25,937
Scott: Scott Johnson no worries.

477
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:37,510
Scott: and Basically, you know he had like me gone through the library and watched some of these old Classic tapes that you know, basically no one knew what the hell they were.

478
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,950
Scott: Like you pick up a tape and it says something on it like Horace Prince of Sun and you're like what the fuck is this?

479
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,050
Rym: It says something about the culture of a club like that.

480
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:55,129
Rym: I mean, it's you know I see other anime clubs But I got to say the RIT anime club like the culture was there because as a freshman, you know I'd go up to the library and I'd pick up a weird tape and it says something weird on it like k?

481
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:58,370
Scott: o No one knows what it is, but I look at it.

482
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,030
Scott: But there's no anime news network encyclopedia to look it up either.

483
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:12,948
Rym: but the old guard like the eboard even if they didn't know what a show was and I did this when I was the president like If I saw a kid standing picks up a tape and I have no idea what the show is I'd be like I'd look at him be like, oh you should watch that.

484
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:22,437
Rym: Even if I couldn't see what the tape was and people did that to me all the time I picked up k o century beast and the librarian at the time was like, ah That's an old classic.

485
00:30:22,498 --> 00:30:23,825
Rym: Nobody in this club has seen that.

486
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:24,489
Rym: you should watch it.

487
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,469
Rym: I don't know if you'd seen it or not.

488
00:30:27,232 --> 00:30:32,008
Scott: Okay, so I found it on anime news network, right and it's called ku tui umikara.

489
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:32,610
Scott: Kita ku.

490
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:43,173
Scott: Yes, it's a movie directed by Tetsuo Imazawa, it's from the year 1993.

491
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:45,562
Rym: Wow, like that's newer than I would have guessed.

492
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,228
Scott: Yeah, it was.

493
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:47,770
Scott: it's hard.

494
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,410
Scott: They actually have a screenshot a picture from it, which is kind of amazing.

495
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,273
Scott: And it also seems like.

496
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:58,070
Scott: there's a movie called summer days with ku about like a kid with a kappa named ku.

497
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,600
Scott: I don't know.

498
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,073
Rym: Whoa 2007 movie.

499
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:04,583
Scott: I don't know if it's related to the original in any way whatsoever.

500
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:06,810
Rym: I think of the entire crew.

501
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,809
Rym: It's funny because you fell asleep through a lot of anime.

502
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:17,050
Scott: Well, because what happened is you'd watch one in like the lounge at night and we'd all be laying You know around watching anime and I would just fall asleep.

503
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,217
Rym: Yep, because I did that a couple of times.

504
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:21,364
Rym: but did you just watch ku by yourself?

505
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:24,775
Scott: because I don't think I watched it by Myself on VHS.

506
00:31:24,855 --> 00:31:28,788
Rym: I did that with all the slayers OAVs back then but basically ku right.

507
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:32,099
Scott: for those of you Don't know which is probably almost all of you right?

508
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,744
Scott: Is this really old anime from 1993?

509
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:34,165
Scott: It's a movie.

510
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:36,254
Scott: That's it.

511
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:40,255
Scott: And basically this movie is Free willy the movie.

512
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,339
Scott: I'm gonna look up the year.

513
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,704
Scott: Free Willy was also 1993, huh?

514
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:47,510
Scott: I wonder right, but I don't know anyway.

515
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:52,946
Scott: So basically what it was about is it was his kid who finds basically the Loch Ness monster.

516
00:31:52,986 --> 00:31:56,194
Scott: It's like a cute little baby Sea dinosaur.

517
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:58,766
Scott: it's got you know, like flippers in front but a long neck.

518
00:31:58,806 --> 00:32:02,442
Scott: so it looks like you know One of those sea dinosaurs, you know, I'm talking about.

519
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:07,507
Scott: I forget the name of that dinosaur If any paleontologist would like to hook me up with the name of the.

520
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:13,090
Scott: you know The ocean e dinosaurs that have the flippers but the long necks right like the non-existent brontosaurus.

521
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:15,399
Scott: Anyway, it's one of those.

522
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,384
Scott: it's a sea monster.

523
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:17,550
Scott: He finds it when it's a baby.

524
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:21,407
Scott: I think it sort of grows up and the movie is about like setting it free.

525
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:22,110
Scott: right, you know.

526
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:24,800
Scott: And he lives, you know, he lives in a tropical island.

527
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,346
Scott: There's not too many people around.

528
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:29,299
Scott: he discovers it He befriends it sets it free.

529
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:31,450
Scott: the whole right guys come looking for it.

530
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,263
Scott: It's kind of an ET Free Willy situation and it's actually a really high quality movie.

531
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:38,630
Scott: That is pretty much completely unknown.

532
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:41,096
Scott: I remember it being like surprisingly good.

533
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,921
Scott: better than Free Willy, right?

534
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:44,465
Rym: I never saw Free Willy.

535
00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:50,059
Scott: It's the same thing only better And I don't know where you can possibly watch this.

536
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,225
Scott: Good luck finding a fansub.

537
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:53,128
Scott: We're working on it.

538
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:53,890
Scott: Good luck.

539
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:54,939
Rym: We'll get it out there.

540
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,692
Rym: if anyone can get it out there We can do it.

541
00:32:56,813 --> 00:33:00,730
Scott: the only copy that I know of is at the RIT Anime Club on the VHS tape.

542
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:02,416
Rym: We're gonna do something about that.

543
00:33:02,476 --> 00:33:04,142
Rym: I got a VCR right over there.

544
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:07,940
Scott: Yes, so that's that What I remember.

545
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,249
Rym: let's just go right down this list.

546
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:11,509
Rym: Surprisingly, this is a bad one.

547
00:33:11,876 --> 00:33:23,067
Rym: I mean, you know You all know Odean because Daryl Surratt masterfully keeps reminding everyone that that movie exists when we really should Think it's because they keep reminding everyone of Odean because of the niche.

548
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:28,430
Rym: true But I feel like we'd be better off if we just killed everyone involved who had knowledge of it and just buried it.

549
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:29,035
Rym: that was the end.

550
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:36,228
Rym: but I The only reason great digital target is not worse than Odean is because Odean is like 80 hours long.

551
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:39,621
Scott: Yeah, so great digital target.

552
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:40,204
Scott: That's another one.

553
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:43,235
Scott: We just saw it in the library We picked it up and we watched it right.

554
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:48,350
Scott: and usually when we watch stuff like, you know, there wasn't much that was bad.

555
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:54,090
Scott: You know everything tended to either be okay average good mildly entertaining, right?

556
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,947
Scott: There wasn't anything that we would all be like, oh god, this is terrible.

557
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:58,510
Scott: turn it off.

558
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:02,107
Rym: Plus we were watching anime kind of always like every Saturday.

559
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:02,810
Rym: We'd all get together.

560
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,237
Rym: We had a pile of like ten tapes.

561
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:06,810
Scott: We'd pick not even on Saturday like just turn a week.

562
00:34:07,331 --> 00:34:12,268
Rym: Well Saturdays were the days we like play D&D for four hours and then we'd watch anime and then we'd watch.

563
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:17,007
Rym: we'd always watch like One show and then it'd be like two of them or like one in the morning or something.

564
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:22,510
Rym: We're like, alright That's why I was asleep during let's watch another show and no one ever remembered what that second show was.

565
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,244
Scott: yeah, but you know, we watch great digital target.

566
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:33,666
Scott: once is a movie and It's a sci-fi about a dude and I'm trying to go completely on memory here, right?

567
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:38,219
Scott: There was some evil Empire that had like a big tower of machinery.

568
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:46,409
Scott: that was evil and ruling the world and this guy was and he had to go Target, he was the digital target and he had to fight it and he had a friend who was like a robot torso.

569
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,541
Rym: He wasn't a torso the whole time.

570
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:48,822
Rym: He got.

571
00:34:48,862 --> 00:34:50,110
Scott: no there was a woman.

572
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:53,089
Scott: So here's what this movie is about and I don't know what's up with the movie.

573
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:59,083
Rym: I think you see your boobs once with a guy who is like a cool kind of hip normal guy like.

574
00:34:59,104 --> 00:35:04,725
Rym: well He's basically the protagonist type and a girl randomly becomes naked and just hanging out with him.

575
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:13,981
Rym: and then not too long later There's a robot who is a torso and this one arm and a face this every somehow Climbing a cliff.

576
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:14,810
Scott: that happens at the end.

577
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,687
Scott: Everything in the movie is really quiet and slow except the robot who actually talks more.

578
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:20,430
Rym: as far as I can help.

579
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:27,250
Rym: Nothing fucking happens in this movie and it is notable primarily for the fact that it's building up to the so-called climax.

580
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,709
Rym: They're gonna go fight the tower literally freeze-frame.

581
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:40,590
Rym: The freeze-frame starts to like shake and text appears that says five minutes later The signal stopped coming out of the tower and then the credits roll.

582
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:43,955
Scott: Yeah, basically the dude goes to the tower Right and they don't.

583
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,530
Scott: there's no cool action scene of getting into the tower fighting anything in there.

584
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,256
Scott: It's basically just like he goes to the tower Going to the tower.

585
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:57,014
Rym: if it was me or if it was our friend Pete or if it was Alex Maybe it was Greg.

586
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:02,190
Rym: but someone at the end said what we all felt which was what the fuck was that bullshit?

587
00:36:02,653 --> 00:36:03,879
Scott: Yeah, there's basically no ending.

588
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,709
Scott: It's just like here's a picture of the bad guy bad guys lair.

589
00:36:08,691 --> 00:36:14,212
Scott: Okay, he went and then some text scrolls by and there's a picture of some fire and they don't tell you if he lived or Died.

590
00:36:14,232 --> 00:36:14,794
Scott: they don't tell it.

591
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:15,719
Scott: There's no animation.

592
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:16,362
Scott: There's no nothing.

593
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:19,695
Rym: I guess like in in our culture like In college.

594
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:24,530
Rym: great digital target was to all of us what Odine is now to the greater anime community.

595
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:26,073
Rym: Cuz we'd like.

596
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:32,175
Rym: we had all seen many of us Odine, but we had all mercifully seen these sci-fi cut Mmm cuts.

597
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:33,870
Rym: what like two hours out of that movie?

598
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,490
Scott: Yeah, I mean there is that there is a manga for great little target that I've seen in some places.

599
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,494
Rym: I have it somewhere.

600
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:40,016
Rym: Do you?

601
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:41,904
Rym: yeah, I bought it and the MD guys.

602
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:44,596
Scott: Let me see if it's up on that shelf there I'm trying to look with my eyeballs.

603
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:45,581
Scott: I think it's in a box.

604
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:46,305
Scott: Okay.

605
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:47,350
Scott: Yeah, have you read it?

606
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,097
Scott: I mean, what's what's now?

607
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:51,004
Rym: I don't even I don't even know if I still have it.

608
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:52,470
Rym: I might have given it away possibly.

609
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:54,738
Scott: Anyway, great little target like before.

610
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,085
Scott: we knew about things like Odine.

611
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:58,716
Scott: like that was our go-to Example of bad anime.

612
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:03,730
Rym: Yep, of course not to be outdone by Legend of Lemmyre, which I can't remember much about it Except there were boobs all over.

613
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,268
Scott: Well, there's me this Legend of Lemmyre Legend of Chris Tanya and all I remember about either.

614
00:37:07,288 --> 00:37:16,970
Scott: one Well sucked was that there are both really shitty Fantasy OAV slash movies, I guess I don't even remember and they were just generic fantasy crap with boobs.

615
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,404
Scott: That really reminded me of that, you know, big big boob fantasy art.

616
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:21,930
Scott: You see it like different conventions.

617
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,966
Rym: It's always like the big breasted woman straddling a sword that itself is on a snake.

618
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:28,270
Scott: With a chain mail bikini.

619
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,855
Scott: Yeah, right.

620
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:32,222
Scott: That's all I remember about both of those.

621
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,077
Scott: My memory could be completely inaccurate But that's all I remember.

622
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:37,364
Scott: But Lemmyre and Chris Tanya.

623
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:46,581
Rym: But I think right around that time I think what had happened is we at some point saw a bastard So bastard, oh man, that's a sort of one that's like so forgotten.

624
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:48,186
Rym: But it's so fucking awesome.

625
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,470
Scott: It is quite awesome.

626
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:54,910
Scott: So bastard is a fantasy anime and it's one of those situations where it's like the bad guys the good guy, right?

627
00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:01,847
Scott: It's like there's all kinds of evil demons and there's one evil demon who is like the fighting for the bad the good guys But he's still bad.

628
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:05,230
Scott: But he's you know on the he's fighting against all the other bad guys.

629
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,150
Scott: So the good guys are with him and the thing that got us immediately hooked us on bastard, right?

630
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:18,759
Scott: Besides the fact that it was called bastard and besides the fact that there are funny jokes and also the same kind of boobage you Get in Chris Tanya and Lemmyre was that every.

631
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,467
Scott: the name of everything was a metal reference.

632
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,470
Scott: Metallicana.

633
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:30,810
Scott: Yeah, Metallicana and Thraxia You know every single thing in the show was named after some 80s metal band.

634
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:31,752
Rym: It's good stuff.

635
00:38:32,314 --> 00:38:36,706
Rym: And I think as I recall it's actually a good show like it's worth watching.

636
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:44,797
Scott: Yeah, so Bastard like there's a manga - I don't know how much of that if any is out in English or how hard it would Get the bastard anime.

637
00:38:44,877 --> 00:38:45,923
Rym: I didn't even watch all of it.

638
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:47,190
Rym: I want I think I fell asleep.

639
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:52,790
Rym: We watched like a bit of it and then I remember watching like three like multiple.

640
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:53,956
Scott: It was epilogue episodes.

641
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:58,517
Scott: It was either an OAV or a show, but we were watching it But I only I watched less than five of them.

642
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,403
Rym: I think we all watched bastard.

643
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:08,083
Scott: complete collection on Amazon 1660 bucks, uh, I pay like 20 volume 1910 bucks.

644
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:11,913
Scott: So there's at least 19 volumes in English It's just not the manga.

645
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:17,689
Scott: Yeah, that's though the manga 19 volumes, but the complete collection on DVD $60 I'm pretty sure what?

646
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:28,539
Rym: BHS boxset $13, I think we watched like the crew watched the first bit of it like one tape and then like half of us watched more Individually on our own.

647
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,317
Rym: Mmm Bastard and berserk.

648
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:36,930
Rym: we watched both of those and then I think we were looking for more stuff Like at least 20 manga volumes out in English.

649
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:42,331
Rym: But I think we were looking for more stuff like bastard and berserk and then we got fucked by a legend of Lemnier and all That.

650
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:46,085
Scott: yeah, but you know, if I go watch the legend Lemnier today, maybe it'll be good.

651
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:46,486
Scott: I don't know.

652
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:48,596
Rym: I Don't think so.

653
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:49,462
Scott: I don't think so.

654
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:50,407
Rym: I have this feeling.

655
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:50,850
Scott: All right.

656
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,203
Scott: So we're coming up on some of the things that are remember as much.

657
00:39:53,263 --> 00:39:53,585
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,912
Rym: Well Goku doe I don't know.

659
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:55,274
Rym: I don't know.

660
00:39:55,294 --> 00:39:58,250
Rym: if you listeners let us know if you ever heard of or seen Goku doe.

661
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:06,459
Rym: It's basically it's a slayers like but everyone's jerks, especially the main character And I just remember being really really freaking funny.

662
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,505
Scott: Yeah, there was something like me.

663
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:19,430
Scott: I remember Goku was like a show and Like they were TV the DVDs for it were everywhere Like someone had printed a whole bunch of DVDs for it and tried to sell it and I don't think anyone bought it.

664
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:28,029
Rym: But we watched it at some point and like the early episodes are wicked funny Halfway through it looks kind of thing where the main character doesn't want to do the.

665
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:30,730
Rym: you know The magic thing where him and his brother have to combine their swords.

666
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,573
Scott: I don't even remember.

667
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:33,921
Scott: I remember there was a funny genie and some other father.

668
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:34,744
Rym: He's awesome.

669
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:35,527
Rym: So is the Sphinx.

670
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:38,598
Scott: Yes Yeah, there was just these funny characters.

671
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:41,809
Scott: You too doing funny stuff catchy opening and ending music.

672
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:44,261
Scott: And it was.

673
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,110
Scott: it was a comedic fantasy show.

674
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,089
Scott: That's all I remember.

675
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,200
Scott: But we started watching it and then we stopped watching it.

676
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:57,170
Rym: think at one point that the demon guys like Goku doe I'll make you King for your soul and he's like, can I just give you that guy's soul?

677
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,361
Rym: And he's like, I don't think it works that way.

678
00:40:59,402 --> 00:40:59,683
Rym: You know what?

679
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:00,025
Rym: Why not?

680
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:00,709
Rym: Let's go for it.

681
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:03,999
Scott: Yeah, but it was just a show like that.

682
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,225
Rym: That was the show where he eats the soul.

683
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,550
Rym: He's just like oh, yeah.

684
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:15,824
Scott: That's why I always thought that Akamaka was from that show instead of ko beast because that's all eating and the sort of comp comedic Demonish stuff not to be confused with soul eater.

685
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:16,688
Scott: No, not at all.

686
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:21,220
Scott: but yeah, I mean Go kiddo, they printed so many DVDs.

687
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,063
Scott: I can't imagine.

688
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:23,730
Scott: it's gotta be cheap to get them all.

689
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,797
Rym: I don't remember when it came out.

690
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:29,522
Rym: I think we were watching it like circa 2004. just went to Luke's house all the time.

691
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:30,910
Rym: Remember we watch it with him and Gabby.

692
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:35,606
Scott: Yeah, someone's got to go and like resurrect that show but not like for reals.

693
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:38,116
Scott: just someone get all the DVDs Dude, put it on crunchyroll.

694
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:39,262
Rym: I'm sure people would watch it.

695
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:40,507
Scott: Maybe it is on crunchyroll.

696
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:41,809
Rym: Oh if it is I'll watch it again.

697
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:42,412
Scott: I don't know.

698
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:44,097
Rym: after I finished doing is people?

699
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:46,304
Scott: I never watched that many episodes of it.

700
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:49,637
Scott: people told me that towards the end It's not funny anymore.

701
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:51,286
Scott: Yeah loses what it had.

702
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:51,969
Rym: I heard that too.

703
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:57,187
Rym: Of course, I don't know if this is obscure or not, but I think it's obscured.

704
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,974
Rym: now again Dragon half.

705
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,178
Scott: there's a manga.

706
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:04,790
Scott: Do you want to store that the story of dragon half which is probably true?

707
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:05,691
Rym: I don't.

708
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:09,068
Rym: I don't think we should because I got to research that because I don't know.

709
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,377
Scott: Yes, mostly just hearsay that.

710
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:13,624
Rym: so what the rumor was?

711
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:15,230
Rym: back at RIT I searched.

712
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:20,650
Rym: Okay, there was that there was a manga dragon half and the guy who made it got in trouble for some sort of perverted thing.

713
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:21,995
Rym: And then the manga stopped.

714
00:42:22,196 --> 00:42:25,650
Rym: but they made an anime about it, but the anime only covers the first bit of the manga.

715
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:29,247
Scott: Yeah, but basically anime is two episodes right now.

716
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:31,918
Rym: Yeah, I Think that shows hilarious.

717
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,830
Scott: It is the I don't know what the manga is about.

718
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:39,290
Scott: I think at the amount heard the manga is more perverted and that doesn't surprise me with the story of the guy being perverted.

719
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:45,190
Scott: But the anime is significantly less perverted and is really hilarious even though there's only two episodes.

720
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:45,970
Scott: It's really funny.

721
00:42:46,552 --> 00:42:52,334
Scott: It's about this girl whose mom's a dragon and dad or dad's the night who went to slay the dragon as a Connecticut and then Funny shit.

722
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:53,119
Rym: They got it on.

723
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:54,549
Rym: yeah dragons are all cute.

724
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:02,710
Rym: There's so many like jokes I could make about the show, but it's so short I can't spoil it for you.

725
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:07,104
Scott: Just watch it and it's got the bad guys a little slime jelly thing.

726
00:43:07,204 --> 00:43:07,726
Rym: Oh my god.

727
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:08,268
Rym: You're good.

728
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:08,890
Rym: slime half.

729
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,906
Rym: There's a reference to about dragon half.

730
00:43:11,947 --> 00:43:12,490
Rym: for any of you?

731
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:15,810
Rym: So old anime stuff with slayers.

732
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:29,387
Rym: So In the slayers movie in the dub they make a reference to a slime half Which is actually a reference to dragon half because there is a slime half in dragon half.

733
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:32,017
Rym: Yeah It's just great.

734
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:34,110
Rym: and watch the closing animation.

735
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:36,759
Scott: Yeah, the closing animation is the way.

736
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:38,485
Scott: neither the opening animation is bad either.

737
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,070
Rym: So let's go way back to before.

738
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:40,814
Rym: I was RIT.

739
00:43:40,874 --> 00:43:41,839
Rym: I was an anime fan.

740
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:53,930
Scott: I already watched everything in blockbuster Except they added a tape and it was called the lens man, you know I can't even remember anything about the lens man anime other than we joked about it a lot.

741
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:58,890
Scott: So I actually read a lot of the lens min books relatively recently like a year few ago.

742
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:05,341
Rym: it was on the sci-fi channel and I watched it and all I remember is that it was sci-fi.

743
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:14,970
Rym: and then I fell asleep and I woke up and He was flying with the green guy through this crazy scene and then the movie ended and I missed I guess all the plots.

744
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,879
Rym: I had no idea what happened and they never showed it again.

745
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:19,109
Scott: And meanwhile Pete had the tape too, right?

746
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:20,918
Scott: So it's like we weren't alone.

747
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:25,544
Scott: like lens min was like within our group I had like multiple people who had knew about it and had it.

748
00:44:25,765 --> 00:44:26,650
Rym: there was a weird point.

749
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,040
Scott: I had a tape around here somewhere.

750
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:34,546
Rym: Yeah, I got the tape later in my life I was at a blockbuster and I want to see the tape from where I'm sitting.

751
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:39,490
Rym: I wanted yes right over there I wanted to see it again and I was looking for it with my mom.

752
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:48,920
Rym: I had like a blockbuster sale and this anime nerd was there, you know I'd never run into an anime fan other than myself before and you know my crew of people and he was like the lens.

753
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,647
Rym: min is difficult to get because it were.

754
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:53,620
Rym: there was a problem with The licensing and it was pulled from the shelves.

755
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,535
Rym: So if you find a VHS tape is actually valuable I'm sure and I was like fuck.

756
00:44:58,258 --> 00:44:59,161
Rym: so I'd forgotten about it.

757
00:44:59,181 --> 00:45:07,188
Rym: and then we watched it again at RIT and I fell asleep at some point and I remember ever watching it at RIT.

758
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,715
Rym: I don't know if you were there But we like you like.

759
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:12,730
Scott: I remember certain things that we tried to watch them and I fell asleep.

760
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,461
Scott: Right, for example, like I think we tried to watch kotocha and I fell asleep.

761
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:17,027
Scott: Yep, and certain Lupin movies.

762
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:21,850
Scott: I fell asleep Yeah, but I don't remember ever trying movies are dangerous to follow.

763
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:26,634
Scott: I don't remember ever watching or falling asleep during The last.

764
00:45:26,735 --> 00:45:28,743
Rym: the last time I fell asleep during a Lupin movie.

765
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,390
Rym: It was normally upon action.

766
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:37,050
Rym: I fall asleep I wake up and there is a brain in a rocket like a gigantic brain.

767
00:45:37,211 --> 00:45:39,524
Rym: I was mama flying out into space.

768
00:45:39,624 --> 00:45:43,250
Rym: Yeah Don't fall asleep during the pond movies.

769
00:45:43,613 --> 00:45:53,463
Rym: I don't think you were there but I remember us watching Lensman and all I know is that I fell asleep and I woke up during the same fucking scene where he's flying with the green Guy through some crazy scene and that it ended.

770
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:58,323
Scott: and I still don't know what happened I think is why did I always wake up at the end of things miraculously somehow?

771
00:45:58,885 --> 00:46:02,177
Rym: maybe because the energy of the room You know, they only those old movies always played.

772
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:07,708
Scott: that kind of early 90s synthesizer rock would have happened If everyone fell asleep during the movie.

773
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:14,345
Rym: We just wake up like four hours later static on the TV the next day.

774
00:46:14,365 --> 00:46:16,010
Rym: that would have been awful.

775
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:18,219
Rym: I'm so glad that never had imagine this.

776
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,130
Rym: it's Sunday night where it's like 4 in the morning.

777
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,880
Rym: We're watching some anime and you just wake up.

778
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:25,385
Rym: You don't know what time it is.

779
00:46:25,405 --> 00:46:26,730
Rym: You're probably late for class.

780
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,444
Scott: There's just static on the TV, you know, everyone else is still there sleeping.

781
00:46:31,524 --> 00:46:33,350
Rym: You don't even remember what you watched.

782
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,755
Scott: No, everyone fell asleep during it.

783
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:37,239
Scott: that never happened.

784
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,061
Scott: No, luckily.

785
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:48,744
Rym: Yeah, but there but there but for the grace of God when we But yeah kotocha we didn't even we watched the summary movie as far as I can tell

786
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:57,125
Scott: and we fell asleep during it We thought not because it wasn't, you know I've seen a lot of clips from kotocha and it seems like it's a totally hilarious

787
00:46:57,145 --> 00:46:58,913
Rym: fell asleep because it was 4 in the fucking Morning,

788
00:46:58,994 --> 00:47:00,930
Scott: it's a totally hilarious silly kind of show.

789
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,090
Scott: I kind of actually want to go back and see if I can watch it again.

790
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,686
Scott: Yeah, but I fell asleep the one time we actually watched it.

791
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:07,510
Scott: So I don't remember shit.

792
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:11,330
Rym: It was like that and Kimigurri orange road and marmalade boy.

793
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:21,350
Scott: Well, those are a lot of the shojos that were fans that the people who were running the club before we got there were big Fans of those, you know those shojo series so they had them all in the library.

794
00:47:21,832 --> 00:47:24,863
Scott: I never really attempted to watch them, but I think you did right.

795
00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:26,770
Scott: there was like please save my earth was another one.

796
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:28,404
Rym: Oh my god, please save my.

797
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,496
Rym: I Both loved and hated.

798
00:47:30,536 --> 00:47:31,420
Rym: please save my earth.

799
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:35,400
Rym: when I watched it like I was fascinated by it But I couldn't figure out if it was good.

800
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,095
Rym: Yeah, but yeah No, no one in the crew watched.

801
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:49,410
Rym: that put me back then and like marmalade boy and kor Especially we're really really popular like in the club, but I don't think they were that popular Outside of the club in America.

802
00:47:49,591 --> 00:47:53,949
Scott: You don't hear anyone mentioning Kimigurri orange road or marmalade, right?

803
00:47:54,470 --> 00:48:02,428
Rym: You hear more mentions of touch than you hear of those Joe Yep, except you hear about those shows in the club and among the people in our crew who like no show.

804
00:48:02,469 --> 00:48:05,418
Rym: Joe Mmm, like Laura remembers all those shows.

805
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:14,950
Scott: It seems like it's like just the people that were like, you know, like Networking Lee close to us right and spread out for the right date like no those shows but no else.

806
00:48:15,352 --> 00:48:17,124
Rym: Wow, you reminded me of please save my earth.

807
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:17,970
Rym: that came out of nowhere.

808
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:19,256
Rym: There was the show where.

809
00:48:19,578 --> 00:48:22,190
Rym: so here's the plot of please save my earth because it's really cool idea.

810
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:31,588
Rym: Right, you got a bunch of people and they all have weird like individually have weird dreams all the time and one of them puts an ad like in the newspaper like hey, do you have dreams about this?

811
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:44,688
Rym: and Like this group of people because of this ad come together and they none of them knew each other but they all realize that they're all having the exact same dreams and the dreams involved like a future past and a base on the moon.

812
00:48:44,709 --> 00:48:49,589
Rym: and You know, they do some telescoping and they see the fucking base on the moon.

813
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:52,583
Scott: So the base on the moon is giving them dreams about self.

814
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:54,230
Rym: They had a past life of some kind.

815
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:59,090
Rym: they have all these memories of it and It could just be a loose nation or something crazy.

816
00:48:59,451 --> 00:49:03,102
Rym: But then they find kind of real evidence that no something really happened.

817
00:49:03,122 --> 00:49:03,964
Rym: Mm-hmm.

818
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,027
Rym: And that is a cool premise.

819
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:05,789
Rym: I think for a show.

820
00:49:06,951 --> 00:49:11,669
Rym: It goes way off the deep end from there and I have no idea.

821
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,834
Scott: Cool premise.

822
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:15,325
Scott: I didn't even know that and what the show was about until just now.

823
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:16,490
Rym: we should watch it again.

824
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:17,575
Rym: I got it somewhere.

825
00:49:17,615 --> 00:49:18,881
Rym: I got a VHS tape it off it.

826
00:49:19,102 --> 00:49:20,790
Scott: I'm sure thing is you've already told me the premise.

827
00:49:20,973 --> 00:49:22,028
Scott: So what do I need to watch it for?

828
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:23,472
Scott: Discovering.

829
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:25,682
Scott: I think the awesome part of the show would be discovering.

830
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:26,043
Scott: Oh shit.

831
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,028
Scott: You actually did have a secret.

832
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:27,530
Scott: pass the end.

833
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:29,617
Rym: Yeah, but there's more to it than that.

834
00:49:29,637 --> 00:49:32,189
Scott: and I there was a radio drama, but it goes on the deep end.

835
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:37,687
Rym: Yeah, but I don't know if that's just because the anime was like compressing and then stops.

836
00:49:37,847 --> 00:49:38,470
Scott: Was there a manga?

837
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:40,579
Rym: I don't know, but there's a radio drama.

838
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:43,370
Rym: I don't know anything about this show except that had a really good soundtrack.

839
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:55,463
Scott: I mean that there were a lot of shows that like they were just Constantly like I kept seeing the shows or seeing characters from the shows when we were in the anime club But I never watched them or knew anything about them like Sabre Jay and such.

840
00:49:55,704 --> 00:50:02,092
Rym: Sabre Jay was kind of like a poor man's Tenshi, it has a bullshit ending like I didn't watch it I don't even know.

841
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:08,482
Scott: imagine a show that does about like catgirl nukunuku or oh man Video girl.

842
00:50:08,562 --> 00:50:10,172
Rym: I Video girl.

843
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:11,616
Rym: I was really popular.

844
00:50:11,797 --> 00:50:14,906
Scott: Not dnangel but DNA Squared.

845
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:16,370
Rym: Adam fucking loves that show.

846
00:50:16,651 --> 00:50:17,413
Rym: Yeah, it was cute.

847
00:50:18,256 --> 00:50:21,347
Rym: or uh, Birdie the Mighty, but I think after Gerald reviewed it.

848
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:22,210
Rym: I think it had a resurgence.

849
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:24,316
Scott: Yeah, that's that was at a sequel even.

850
00:50:24,457 --> 00:50:27,005
Rym: Yeah, I really like the sequel actually.

851
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:27,787
Scott: I haven't watched it.

852
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:28,770
Rym: It's worth watching.

853
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:29,413
Rym: It's really fun.

854
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:32,605
Rym: Yeah, but oh god, so you see what happened.

855
00:50:32,645 --> 00:50:35,035
Rym: suddenly remembering all these shows I'd completely forgotten about.

856
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:38,207
Rym: but Sabre Jay has just the bullshit is ending ever.

857
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:39,692
Rym: imagine ending Where you.

858
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,139
Rym: the entire plot point involves some huge sacrifice.

859
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,729
Rym: All right, and then in the credits just don't do that for no reason.

860
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:48,508
Rym: Just undo all the sacrifice would keep the rest.

861
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:50,834
Scott: Yeah, man.

862
00:50:50,874 --> 00:50:55,090
Scott: I just I mean there's even shows that were like, you know more recent than that.

863
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,865
Scott: You think no one would forget them like great teacher onizuka, but that shows been forgotten, right?

864
00:50:58,985 --> 00:51:00,210
Scott: Yeah, who's remembering that?

865
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:07,330
Rym: Like video girl I was popular as far as I can tell like it seemed really popular and anime cons.

866
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:12,730
Rym: But no one I know has ever actually watched more than like a few minutes of it.

867
00:51:13,252 --> 00:51:17,689
Rym: I've never actually watched it, but it seems like everyone I met at cons knew what it was.

868
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:19,223
Rym: now No one at cons knows what it is.

869
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:21,117
Scott: Yeah All right.

870
00:51:21,177 --> 00:51:22,489
Scott: Do we want to keep going here?

871
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:24,153
Scott: Memory is sorry.

872
00:51:24,194 --> 00:51:28,350
Scott: I'm trying to like a picture like the sea of tapes and like to remember individual things.

873
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,370
Rym: There's that a SMAP concert we had on tape.

874
00:51:31,537 --> 00:51:34,861
Scott: Oh, yeah No I do and I did mention early in the show Horace Prince of Sun.

875
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:39,276
Scott: if you can find Horace Prince of the Sun it might Also be holus Prince of Sun.

876
00:51:39,316 --> 00:51:39,958
Scott: Basically.

877
00:51:40,419 --> 00:51:44,370
Scott: This is an old Toei movie and like Miyazaki worked on it.

878
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,050
Scott: He didn't direct it, but he worked on it.

879
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,650
Scott: It's like you can think of it sort of as like the first Miyazaki work is it?

880
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:55,210
Scott: You can see a lot in common between it and the things he did later and it does show its age.

881
00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:01,850
Scott: You know, it's an old, you know old the oldly styled animated thing, but I really liked it when I watched it.

882
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,397
Scott: I kind of really want to watch it again.

883
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:06,390
Scott: It's you know, that quiet watch it at night kind of thing.

884
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,113
Scott: It's pretty awesome.

885
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,939
Scott: I wish they would release a DVD.

886
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:22,210
Scott: like they don't have to release a DVD of just that but they should Like, you know Take that and package it with a bunch of other things all together, you know That's not a bad idea.

887
00:52:22,531 --> 00:52:27,727
Scott: Horace Prince of Sun and a bunch of other similarly old Toei movies all together on one disc.

888
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:28,570
Scott: That would be pretty cool.

889
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:31,106
Rym: I think a lot of the shows we talked about would do really well.

890
00:52:31,146 --> 00:52:32,971
Rym: on crunchyroll Probably.

891
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:36,282
Rym: yeah, I don't know so much about things like marmalade boy.

892
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,550
Rym: I don't know if the demographic is there anymore.

893
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:39,194
Scott: I don't think so.

894
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:40,301
Rym: It's hard to say though.

895
00:52:40,382 --> 00:52:41,690
Scott: Let's see which one of these could do.

896
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:47,030
Rym: Well, I think that I think dragon half would be like a one-shot like wonder if it was just on crunchyroll.

897
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:52,050
Scott: Yeah, it might be hard to just sell the two episodes For free and then people would like it.

898
00:52:52,130 --> 00:53:05,783
Scott: I think if you did a remake of bastard that removed the porniness but kept the awesome hilarity metal references Yeah, I think that you could definitely do some koto cha Sort of remarketing to get that out there polish it up.

899
00:53:06,024 --> 00:53:07,730
Rym: I think kimigiri orange road could be read.

900
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:08,231
Rym: I think.

901
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:09,856
Scott: who could be sold as a movie?

902
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:14,310
Scott: if you write something like that easily great digital target would probably burn really really.

903
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:17,190
Scott: These I think pretty much have no marketable value.

904
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:18,649
Rym: It depends.

905
00:53:19,691 --> 00:53:28,070
Rym: Gokudo is one thing where I think if you put it on crunchyroll It would get popular among the people who like things like slayers.

906
00:53:29,571 --> 00:53:30,455
Scott: It's it's hard though.

907
00:53:30,475 --> 00:53:31,258
Scott: How many you know?

908
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:33,989
Rym: the thing is slayers should also be on crunchyroll.

909
00:53:35,873 --> 00:53:37,287
Scott: Yeah slayer should be on crunchyroll.

910
00:53:37,307 --> 00:53:37,590
Scott: you're right.

911
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:41,887
Rym: I think it would cause a whole resurgence of that kind of anime actually in America at least.

912
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:43,433
Rym: yeah I don't know.

913
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,055
Rym: we're petering out.

914
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:46,164
Rym: Let's just kick it off right here and kick it under.

915
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:46,826
Scott: we're done.

916
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:49,838
Rym: kick it out Devil doll.

917
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:52,151
Rym: I Think it's time to kick it.
