00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,578
Rym: It's Wednesday December 15th 2010.

2
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:11,999
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,517
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight the terrible anime apocalypse.

4
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:18,028
Rym: zero.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,528
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:32,106
Scott: So my co-worker today he used to work more downtown ish in the Union Square area.

7
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,230
Rym: I'd like to work down there.

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,675
Rym: I kind of I really am sick of working in Midtown just for the fact that I can't get lunch for less than like 10 Bucks.

9
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:43,310
Scott: I also hate Midtown But anyway, he really wanted to go back down there to eat lunch like at these places.

10
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:44,578
Scott: He used to eat lunch yet, right?

11
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:46,229
Scott: Cuz he doesn't come to the city every day.

12
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,696
Rym: Oh, is this one of those?

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,685
Rym: the place he remembered being good wasn't good.

14
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:52,181
Scott: No, the place He remembered being good was too good.

15
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:53,975
Scott: So Trouble.

16
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:55,930
Scott: we went down to this burrito place.

17
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:59,024
Scott: I forget the name of it, but I know exactly where it is so I could take you there.

18
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:05,810
Rym: and it's basically So if on a scale of if zero is Baja Fresh and five why is Baja Fresh zero?

19
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:08,178
Rym: Baja Fresh really it's real.

20
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,570
Scott: Maybe the I mean Baja Fresh is way better than Qdoba.

21
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:13,040
Rym: I actually prefer can you know what?

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,310
Scott: Qdoba's way way better than Taco Bell?

23
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:24,762
Rym: So I would all right I was saying if we set the scale zero being the minimum acceptable as Baja Fresh All right, and five is like a Chipotle.

24
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:26,410
Rym: All right, where is this place?

25
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,136
Scott: Well, I mean, it's.

26
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:30,490
Scott: I would compare it to cafe Maya.

27
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:34,850
Scott: But the problem is is that cafe Maya is almost like a different kind, right?

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,630
Scott: Kevin Maya is like a sit-down meal and this is clearly a lunch burrito kind of place, right?

29
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,945
Scott: but in terms of lunch burrito kind of place So far number one in New York City.

30
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,412
Scott: Absolutely Really?

31
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:50,398
Scott: No question at all.

32
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:51,401
Rym: I am intrigued.

33
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,645
Scott: the burrito though.

34
00:01:52,665 --> 00:02:01,790
Scott: I got the California burrito Was so ginormous Right that I was unable to finish it and a good 15 to 20 percent of it was left uneaten.

35
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:04,245
Rym: So where where did this end up?

36
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:07,478
Scott: It ended up.

37
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:09,045
Rym: I don't know you threw it away.

38
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:18,089
Scott: Yeah, pretty much Say I didn't want to but it was pretty much like there is no way I'm gonna eat this ever Because it's just so big and my stomach was so full.

39
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:24,028
Scott: I've pretty much done the mushroom and pretty much the refrigerator at work is Ho ho rendus.

40
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:33,577
Rym: I've pretty much wandered in every direction that I can reasonably walk to eat somewhere and walk back within an hour or so Mm-hmm, and I'm running out.

41
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:37,330
Scott: Actually we places the subway going taking the subway down to Union Square.

42
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:39,549
Scott: It actually took surprisingly not much time.

43
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:44,010
Rym: I've done that a couple of times never to eat always till I go to a particular store or something.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,390
Scott: Yeah, because we just pretty much went down eight and came back.

45
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,455
Scott: It didn't take much time at all.

46
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:52,758
Scott: and we sat down and ate, you know, and there was a Muji store down there I didn't know about and he would know that.

47
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,490
Scott: that's how I know where the burrito place is cuz they're right next to the Muji.

48
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:56,778
Rym: Let's go check this place out.

49
00:02:56,838 --> 00:03:06,829
Scott: However, after we ate at the burrito place We went to a place I think was called City Bakery Because he had remembered the best hot chocolate being there.

50
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:07,688
Scott: All right.

51
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:18,654
Scott: So we went and got this hot chocolate and they had two varieties regular which is dark chocolate But that's the default and milk chocolate which is not the default and for 50 cents You can get a marshmallow.

52
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:19,598
Scott: which was?

53
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:22,750
Scott: they made the marshmallow and they cut a big marshmallow cube.

54
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:25,230
Rym: What's the marshmallow made out of marshmallow?

55
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:27,037
Scott: I don't know what it was made.

56
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:28,546
Rym: or was it a fake marshmallow?

57
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:31,217
Scott: like most marshmallows It was a real marshmallow that they made.

58
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,770
Rym: if they made it then it's not a real marshmallow.

59
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,918
Rym: Whatever marshmallow is a plant anyway, anyway, uh How was this hot chocolate?

60
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:42,984
Rym: You're leaving me in suspense.

61
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,010
Rym: It was basically.

62
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:50,490
Scott: I don't know if I would really qualify it as hot chocolate right because it was so insanely delicious.

63
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,622
Rym: It was basically a candy bar in a cup.

64
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:56,941
Scott: Yeah, it was a melted Chocolate bar in a cup.

65
00:03:57,061 --> 00:04:02,781
Scott: that was like the best, you know Like an ultra high quality bar of dark chocolate melted in a cup.

66
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:08,422
Scott: just the right temperature not burning you not cold Right, and it was thinned out.

67
00:04:08,442 --> 00:04:09,890
Rym: It was just right.

68
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,252
Scott: It was thinned out, you know just enough that it you know Wasn't?

69
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:19,099
Scott: it was like on the border like any thicker would have been undrinkable But it was just on the drinkable side of thickness.

70
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,601
Rym: see.

71
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:26,147
Scott: and then the giant marshmallow cube was amazing But I could only eat like two bites of it because by this point my stomach was still 100% full.

72
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,006
Rym: You're the one who made the choice to get that after having not finished the burrito and it's still 100% full.

73
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:36,165
Scott: So I'm pretty full.

74
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:41,230
Rym: I'm curious because Le Cafe Henri has some pretty damn good hot chocolate.

75
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,258
Rym: We'll have to go and check.

76
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:50,311
Scott: But basically this bakery place not only they have this hot chocolate But pretty much everything else they had in terms of cookies and muffins and all that stuff Like.

77
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:55,433
Scott: this is the kind of place that I could go and eat a different thing every day and never get bored and it was Wicked crowded.

78
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:59,090
Scott: So yeah, and they had a. there's a little tiny room in there.

79
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,170
Scott: That was the chocolate room and it was like this little closet of chocolate.

80
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:04,670
Rym: It was like it was made out of chocolate.

81
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,588
Scott: No, it had chocolate for sale in it.

82
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,926
Scott: It was a little tiny closet and you would go in there and get a chocolate and it was it.

83
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:11,273
Scott: you'll see it if you Go down there.

84
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:11,675
Scott: All right.

85
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:12,077
Scott: All right.

86
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:20,810
Rym: So in a geek bite an anime geek bite I happened to watch with Emily last night the professor Layton movie professor Layton and the eternal diva.

87
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,441
Scott: I'm still playing the third video game Layton.

88
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:26,974
Rym: Kyoju toy and no Otahime.

89
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:27,456
Rym: Yep.

90
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:29,041
Rym: It was okay.

91
00:05:29,602 --> 00:05:30,766
Scott: It was it was beautiful.

92
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:31,930
Scott: It was like the video games.

93
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:33,854
Rym: Not to spoil.

94
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:52,370
Rym: there is a point not that far in where an evil voice appears and a projector Projects the zero zero one on the wall and the voice says your first puzzle is this It was okay, it was fun it was beautiful.

95
00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:03,922
Rym: I'd recommend watching it, but it really just made me want to watch Lupin and the castle of Cagliostro again Because it seemed to homage that a couple of times.

96
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:05,026
Scott: Yeah, I could definitely see that.

97
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:10,350
Rym: the similarities there Yeah, but Luke kegliostro is a thousand times better than this which means this.

98
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:14,070
Scott: That makes me really wish they were new good Lupin's.

99
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:26,730
Rym: We haven't watched the last like five or six or not, but they're not a quality, you know It's not like Fuma conspiracy All right, you know Fuma as good as it is doesn't really hold up as well as say Cagliostro.

100
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,017
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's like mom.

101
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:29,919
Scott: Oh gee, man.

102
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,450
Scott: This bar of gold doesn't hold up as well as that bar of platinum.

103
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:35,810
Rym: I believe you mean the bar of Babylon gold.

104
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:41,886
Rym: So, yeah, it's no K like a - B plus animated movie and you know our thing.

105
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:45,259
Rym: it's an anime movie There aren't that many watch it.

106
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,022
Rym: God damn it.

107
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:46,324
Rym: Yeah.

108
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:47,669
Rym: Also, it's on pirate thing.

109
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:49,635
Scott: Is it anywhere legally?

110
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:50,418
Rym: I have.

111
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:51,081
Rym: no I guess.

112
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:51,864
Scott: is there a Japanese?

113
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:53,128
Scott: there must be a Japanese DVD.

114
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:53,530
Scott: that's legal.

115
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:58,867
Rym: Actually, it was released within theaters in Germany in Spain interest and Singapore.

116
00:06:59,148 --> 00:06:59,650
Scott: very interesting.

117
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,377
Scott: Is the game a big seller there?

118
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:02,622
Rym: I have no idea.

119
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:04,169
Scott: All right good to know.

120
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:14,875
Rym: one thing though, uh the weird kind of almost romantic homosexual odd Undertones between Layton and that kid.

121
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:16,299
Rym: they're still there.

122
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,485
Rym: Yeah also Layton's dot eyes.

123
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:20,510
Rym: I realized he's the only one with dot eyes.

124
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:31,678
Rym: There's this one scene where someone like he notices something like someone's talking and that scary blank expression dot Face slowly turns Regards this and then slowly turns back.

125
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,647
Rym: That was the closest thing to a Layton rape face I have ever seen.

126
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,449
Rym: Mm-hmm.

127
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:43,010
Scott: So anyway, the biggest news in the anime world right is that the Tokyo Assembly passed this bill.

128
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:56,255
Scott: that was the Youth Ordinance bill and The summary of what this bill does at least one of the things it does from the anime news network Right, which is the really the only place to get any news about this in English Basically the anime news AP wire.

129
00:07:56,536 --> 00:08:06,343
Scott: it prevents the sale and renting of quote harmful publications materials that are Sexually stimulating encourage cruelty and or may compel suicide or criminal behavior.

130
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:07,746
Scott: the people wait wait wait.

131
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,330
Scott: people under the age of 18.

132
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,799
Rym: I've got a real translation of that law.

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,970
Rym: it hereby bans the majority of Japanese media.

134
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:26,249
Scott: It would require the industry to also regulate manga anime and other images except for real-life photography That unjustifiably wait wait wait or if I or exaggerate certain sexual or pseudo sexual acts.

135
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,742
Rym: so Except for real-life photography.

136
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:30,190
Rym: That's a very specific exception.

137
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:38,890
Rym: and if I go back to sell animation Can I not just say that it is that my movie is a collection of thousands upon thousands of still photographs of paintings?

138
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:39,929
Scott: Good question.

139
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:49,982
Scott: another section of the revised bill allows the government to directly regulate above images if the depicted acts are also Considered to be excessively disrupting of social order such as rape.

140
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:50,965
Scott: and that's pretty much.

141
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,115
Scott: I read almost the entire Anime news network article.

142
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:55,580
Rym: so much for rape man, right?

143
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,102
Rym: How's it ok?

144
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:56,946
Rym: Ok, or so?

145
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:01,000
Rym: Yeah anything I like the other additional news that I like rape man.

146
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:13,518
Scott: No, the additional news about this right is that Many many manga publishers are now basically boycotting the Tokyo anime fair Including the big boys like, you know, Shueisha and such and such damn.

147
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:20,760
Scott: Yeah, so, um Yeah, I mean it just sort of reminds you that hey look Japan is loaded with censorship.

148
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:26,120
Scott: You know people always, you know We're always complaining about when there are censorship sort of things happening in the u.s.

149
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:27,185
Scott: And there are some.

150
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:30,440
Rym: there are in fact quite a few but we have that test by first amendment.

151
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:31,869
Rym: That means we always get in here.

152
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:34,844
Scott: Remember the thing is we still Censorship wise?

153
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:37,075
Scott: have it a lot better than a lot of other places.

154
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,844
Scott: It's not the best in the world I'm pretty sure.

155
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:41,340
Scott: like didn't Iceland win the award for best freedom of the press?

156
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:57,039
Rym: Scandinavia pretty much has freer press only because the United States is really bad about boobs Yeah, but even so as obsessed with them and we don't like anyone to see them on TV The United States is still doing pretty good.

157
00:09:57,301 --> 00:10:08,180
Scott: And while this Tokyo ordinance probably won't affect us in any way really and while you know Just you know to anyone out there who's like listen Japan's loaded with pedophiles and all this shit.

158
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,175
Scott: So because there's societies that way they got to do something like this.

159
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:25,450
Scott: and to that I have to say well You know if you believe in freedom of speech in freedom, right while you might be banning nymph et you're simultaneously Banning say Akira and that's not cool.

160
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:32,396
Rym: I don't remember that scene where Akira rapes a little girl though There is rapes in Akira.

161
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:42,902
Scott: Oh, yeah The manga and the Animes, but not pedophile also attempted rape and boobage and violence and suicides and pretty much everything That is made.

162
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:46,736
Scott: Akira would not be allowed to be sold to anyone under the age of 18 by this law.

163
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:51,326
Scott: Well, that is the most famous Most significant manga is ever created.

164
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:56,904
Scott: In fact a great many Tezuka mangas would not be allowed Right.

165
00:10:56,984 --> 00:10:59,896
Rym: I'm pretty sure we could still get ambassador magma.

166
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:00,479
Scott: I don't know.

167
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:10,900
Scott: But anyway, I if this kind of thing, you know Repulses you right to your representative and also send money to the comic book legal defense fund.

168
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:17,760
Rym: The comic book legal defense fund is one of the pretty much pure good charities that there is out there.

169
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:21,539
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, I send the monies you send the monies too.

170
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:28,200
Scott: And then the next time something like, you know, what was that guy Handley who who got arrested for Canada?

171
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:29,630
Scott: Yeah, well no it was.

172
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,020
Scott: it was in the US wasn't it?

173
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,258
Rym: There's a bunch of that going on in Canada because Canada has weird laws about.

174
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:40,149
Scott: yeah so the next time someone gets, you know busted for having hentai's they'll have lawyers.

175
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:55,751
Scott: and You know, we if we all chip in it won't be one person paying a zillion dollars for lawyers But everyone else everyone who cares paying $20.

176
00:11:55,751 --> 00:12:01,970
Rym: But anyway things of the day, so I this video has been stuck in my head in the song, you know ignorance is bliss.

177
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:08,010
Rym: It's this animation someone made to a song that has to do with Mario and Luigi in the Mushroom Kingdom.

178
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,522
Scott: I'm pretty sure this is already a thing of the day.

179
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:11,366
Rym: I searched the archive.

180
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:14,228
Rym: It is in fact not So just to be sure.

181
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:15,153
Rym: Ignorance is.

182
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,237
Rym: bliss is a good video.

183
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,707
Rym: You should watch it, you know, like all those internet videos.

184
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:19,450
Rym: It's good.

185
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:25,790
Rym: but my real thing of the day is The story behind that white knuckles scoring.

186
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:40,589
Rym: What spelled with an apostrophe at the end white knuckles scoring was a comic book and CD put out by Nintendo and I believe 1991. all right, and It's awful.

187
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:42,469
Rym: It's awesomely awful.

188
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:45,679
Rym: but if you watch that video to ignorance is bliss.

189
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:58,163
Rym: that was a song done by a band called the jellyfish which no longer exists and No other song on the CD that that song appears on has anything to do with Mario Luigi the Mushroom Kingdom or even Nintendo.

190
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:04,285
Rym: as far as I can tell and As far as the internet says they're all terrible songs except for ignorance is bliss.

191
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:05,730
Scott: It was pretty terrible.

192
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,356
Rym: Also, I thought it was a good song.

193
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,206
Scott: It has like a good part, but it's it.

194
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:10,889
Rym: I don't know.

195
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:11,290
Rym: I like it.

196
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,990
Rym: I like it in in conjunction with the animation.

197
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:25,049
Rym: So if you wondered what the hell the deal was with that because the kind of had like the animation which was Not made by the band and has nothing to do with the album Kind of tells a story that fits with it.

198
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,826
Rym: The actual story is told in the comic that I have all the scans for you here.

199
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:30,750
Scott: Oh, how about that?

200
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,639
Rym: It's pretty terrible go figure.

201
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:34,943
Rym: So there you go.

202
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,790
Rym: Ignorance is bliss great.

203
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:40,317
Scott: So there's this video.

204
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:43,370
Scott: It's also Mario related, you know, we used to do a ton of Mario.

205
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:47,630
Scott: It's weird that Mario is so heavily used, you know in pretty well.

206
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:49,296
Scott: I guess it's not that much of a surprise.

207
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:55,450
Rym: at one point Bowser tries to cast a spell but because he's ignorant and he Can't read he gives it to Lenny Koopa.

208
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:57,798
Rym: Anyway, so Lenny Koopa's cast.

209
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,390
Scott: You don't need to tell this story and turns Mario Luigi into night.

210
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:08,581
Scott: We used to do things of the day and it felt like in the olden days of GeekNights that the things of the day Would be like it would be a Mario related thing.

211
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:10,089
Scott: almost every other show, you know.

212
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,976
Scott: So is a double dose of Mario.

213
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:13,260
Scott: why the fuck not?

214
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,464
Scott: it's his anniversary.

215
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:16,289
Rym: It's top-favored it on YouTube right now.

216
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:18,438
Rym: What the your thing of the day?

217
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,005
Scott: Yeah, this thing is all over the internet.

218
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:24,844
Scott: if you haven't seen this already I mean, you're just not on the Internet's but it's got about half.

219
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:26,370
Scott: so it's so good.

220
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,515
Scott: You know that it's.

221
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:28,982
Scott: it deserves all those views.

222
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:29,344
Scott: It's got.

223
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:30,710
Rym: it's got about half as many as the yo.

224
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,071
Scott: So I want to make sure that every last person who might want to see it does not miss it while it's big on the Internet's.

225
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:51,036
Scott: basically what these people did is they basically mashed up the Mushroom Kingdom with a generic gangland violence movie and Created sort of like this trailer ish Short movie kind of.

226
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,188
Scott: it's more like a montage of an entire.

227
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,539
Rym: what it is It's what the Mario Brothers movie should have been.

228
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,730
Scott: Yeah, the the really bad way and that's the thing that's so great.

229
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,979
Scott: That's so shocking about this short.

230
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:10,507
Scott: Well, I guess the machinima right, you know is that whoever put this together did a better job times a thousand.

231
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:16,750
Scott: then a Big full-budget Hollywood production was able to do right with Mario.

232
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:21,230
Scott: They did it with like a video game and some doodling and some voice acting.

233
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,518
Rym: You gotta watch YouTube all the way to the edge.

234
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:24,843
Rym: It's me body.

235
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:25,345
Rym: It's a me my.

236
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:28,934
Rym: That's pretty high quality.

237
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:30,619
Scott: It's very high quality.

238
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,762
Scott: It drops jokes.

239
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:32,625
Scott: It's it's.

240
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,350
Scott: it's all around a plus.

241
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:39,150
Rym: So the meta moment, we're actually running out of the first series of GeekNights t-shirts.

242
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,184
Rym: So if you did want one, I'd suggest ordering it soon.

243
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:44,950
Scott: I see like eight or nine on the floor there.

244
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,264
Rym: Yeah, but we're almost out of mediums.

245
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,980
Scott: Oh Yeah, are we out of any other size?

246
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,086
Rym: We're out of smalls already.

247
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:54,289
Scott: All right, you know It's funny all this is a medium large and extra hard.

248
00:15:54,751 --> 00:16:05,415
Rym: If you look at the listeners the people who are asking for xxx L's and up tend to be Tuesday listeners And It's all Rym.

249
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:17,072
Rym: but as I got nothing to do with this, but I know patties That we got more than three times as many requests for baby dolls as we did for xxx L's That's good.

250
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:22,748
Rym: I'm going to cater to the girl demographic before I cater to the xxx xxx xxx L demographic.

251
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:23,210
Scott: I agree.

252
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:32,320
Rym: So if you want to get night t-shirt buy them before they sell out or else you have to wait until we reorder them because we Promised that will order another run if they sell out.

253
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,022
Rym: Mm-hmm.

254
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:35,350
Rym: So you'll get them no matter what that doesn't mean, right?

255
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,178
Scott: So the thing is don't go don't go.

256
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:38,484
Scott: Oh, they're gonna reorder them.

257
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:42,210
Scott: So I don't need to order one now I'll just wait till they reorder and no matter what I'll get one.

258
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:46,590
Scott: The thing is it is gonna take a while for that reorder to come through, you know me.

259
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,090
Rym: So if you do shit and also it's in my queue, I just don't do it for like a year.

260
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:53,235
Scott: Yeah And also you can help us out a lot.

261
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:59,396

303
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,507
Scott: he or he acquired it.

304
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:14,777
Scott: right now He'll watch because we were at his house and bored in his basement We're looking for an anime to watch.

305
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,286
Scott: somehow apocalypse zero got turned on.

306
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:23,810
Rym: I believe he came down He's like you should watch this and he had only seen a little bit past the tit bear.

307
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:27,370
Rym: And he was like, yeah, most people don't make it past the tit bear.

308
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:37,740
Scott: so anyway somehow You know, it's only what a three episode OAV to To 240 minute episodes.

309
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,247
Scott: Wow, so because it was only 240 minute episodes We watched the entire thing in one go.

310
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:49,876
Rym: well it was on the TV and Everyone was watching it and kind of making fun of it and Everyone agreed.

311
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:50,781
Rym: Yeah, this is terrible.

312
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:51,484
Rym: We should turn it off.

313
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,490
Rym: We should watch something else.

314
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:54,798
Rym: They were like, I don't know eight or nine of us down there.

315
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,277
Rym: Everyone else was upstairs basically shouting down to us Why the fuck are you watching that?

316
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:00,061
Rym: Just turn it off.

317
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:01,086
Rym: What's wrong with you?

318
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:04,057
Rym: So We never turned it off.

319
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,470
Rym: In fact at one point when we said hey, we should turn it off.

320
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:13,530
Rym: I don't know who said this but someone said and I quote You can't turn it off until I find out why that chick is a dude in the flashback.

321
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:19,370
Scott: Uh-huh, so we watched it to the end and we found out why the chick was a dude in the flashback.

322
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,559
Rym: That was kind of disappointing.

323
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,050
Scott: That was like the only thing we found out.

324
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:26,861
Rym: I regret nothing However, because apocalypse zero was bad bad enough to where.

325
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:39,349
Rym: normally when we review an anime right on the anime news network I'll like pull it up to remember like who the character designer was or whatever and I'm always surprised that the ratings are Overwhelmingly positive even on shows that I think are terrible.

326
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:43,257
Rym: apocalypse zero Almost all bad reviews.

327
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:47,870
Rym: the worst possible rating is the most used rating for apocalypse zero.

328
00:20:48,151 --> 00:20:50,041
Scott: I now see the thing with apocalypse zero.

329
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:50,322
Scott: right.

330
00:20:50,463 --> 00:20:57,190
Scott: is that it's not so bad It's good, and it's not so bad like odeen like where you're just like kill me now.

331
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,751
Scott: This is so.

332
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:59,797
Scott: it's painful to watch right brutal.

333
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:01,763
Scott: It's just brutally like.

334
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:03,147
Scott: it's just you know, it's.

335
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,370
Scott: it's painfully bad.

336
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,314
Scott: It's not boring.

337
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:06,318
Scott: Oh my god.

338
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:07,282
Scott: When is it gonna be over?

339
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,270
Scott: It's just like oh, that's so terrible.

340
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:14,450
Rym: Oh, that's the worst thing I've ever seen like each of the killer was horribly violent.

341
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:15,110
Rym: It's bad.

342
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:20,150
Scott: It's like you don't want to watch apocalypse zero the way you don't want to be stabbed in the face.

343
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:24,667
Rym: But yet at the same time as you're being stabbed in the face, you're fascinated by the with a rusty spoon.

344
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,410
Rym: You're like you cannot help but be fascinated by what has been wrought onto your eyes.

345
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:31,874
Scott: Yeah, apocalypse.

346
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:37,390
Scott: I imagine like if I was like if I was stabbed in the gut right like most of my brain would be like.

347
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:39,470
Scott: But at least part of you is like.

348
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,844
Scott: This is like exactly a very small part of my brain to be like.

349
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:44,050
Scott: that's what stabbings like.

350
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:49,204
Scott: That's what being stacked is like right, and that's apocalypse zero is basically.

351
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,429
Scott: it's like oh god damn.

352
00:21:51,490 --> 00:22:01,999
Rym: now I know what being stabbed in the eye is like exactly so If you've read the prince of nothing which is one of our first book club books The sequel you know the second set of books.

353
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,344
Rym: They're the non-manor addicts.

354
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:04,146
Rym: This is obviously.

355
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:05,250
Rym: you either know this you don't.

356
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:18,770
Rym: Apocalypse zero is most Memorable and I have decided that if something is bad, but memorable it is not actually bad because if something Writes itself into your memory

357
00:22:19,712 --> 00:22:27,641
Scott: There is something to learn from apocalypse zero while it is not you know an entertaining It way to spend you know 80 minutes of your life

358
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:27,962
Rym: at least.

359
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:32,620
Rym: I've learned that if you cut a guy's karaoke dick off That is most of the way to killing him.

360
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:34,710
Scott: Yes, it is educational.

361
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,642
Scott: So basically let me sum up apocalypse zero right.

362
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:43,143
Scott: so this basic story Is that you have a guy and?

363
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:44,657
Scott: It's an anime.

364
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,098
Scott: so he has superpowers And he puts on a metal suit of armor.

365
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:51,873
Scott: that gives him wicked powers of fighting even though he's good fighting without it But he doesn't.

366
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,850
Rym: he's ultra fighting when he wears it, but he doesn't wear it all the time.

367
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,554
Rym: He fights without it.

368
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,805
Rym: sometimes in fact he fights the tit-bearer without it.

369
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:58,870
Scott: Yeah, he doesn't need it.

370
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,835
Scott: He doesn't wear it for all.

371
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:02,530
Scott: he's good with fighting without it, but he puts it on for super fighting.

372
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:07,461
Scott: You know it's like a transformation kind of thing yeah And basically he goes to it's.

373
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:11,098
Scott: it's like a post-apocalyptic world But for some reason right.

374
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,030
Scott: kids just walk to school in a group like normal.

375
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,416
Scott: It's like there's a normal school.

376
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:18,410
Rym: They're walking through the North Star landscape, right?

377
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:26,267
Scott: It's like they think school is normal and the places the houses they live in are normal But in order to get from one to the other they have to walk through the fist of the North Star world.

378
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:32,910
Rym: now the schools Have guards who are highly trained to keep people who aren't students away from the school, but they do a very bad job.

379
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,465
Rym: Oh, they do a really good job until tactical evil shows out.

380
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:35,908
Rym: you're right.

381
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:39,115
Scott: and basically They're.

382
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:54,930
Scott: every day when they go to school They're harassed by some horrible monster and this guy fights them and basically the course of the two OAV episodes is pretty much Him fighting multiple evil monsters and the thing is that really makes this show stand out.

383
00:23:55,051 --> 00:24:03,470
Scott: It's like is that all of these evil monsters are horribly You know, they're obviously from the same dimension as the Overfiend, right?

384
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,052
Scott: They are.

385
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:08,070
Scott: they are as sexually charged as they are violently charged.

386
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:19,928
Rym: Now what is funny is Scott Johnson who you know told us he turned this on and left it for us to watch continuously says it's not sexual as the dude with the dragon dick.

387
00:24:19,948 --> 00:24:22,734
Rym: I Think that was the third day.

388
00:24:22,814 --> 00:24:24,461
Scott: Okay, so there was a bear with like 20.

389
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:26,672
Scott: There's a bear with 20.

390
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:28,389
Rym: It was not a bear it was a tit bear.

391
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:35,190
Scott: Okay So there's a bear whose body consists entirely of tits filled with acid relative of the dick wolf same same genus.

392
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:40,650
Scott: And then he fights against you know, the the famous, you know, anime's craziest deaths.

393
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,226
Scott: Gigantically large fat woman with the incredibly scary, you know body parts.

394
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:47,430
Rym: the woman who?

395
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,670
Rym: Apparently we didn't get to see this from anime's craziest deaths.

396
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:56,590
Rym: She rapes young boys and then rips their faces off by kissing them and then eats them

397
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,200
Scott: Yeah, and then

398
00:24:58,361 --> 00:25:01,857
Rym: makes pasties With their faces and

399
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,493
Scott: she basically uses like their entire body as you know Hey dildo,

400
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,600
Rym: which is pretty great,

401
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,390
Scott: which is what you have to do if you were so gigantic.

402
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,130
Rym: So this giant woman shows up and she's you know harassing these kids.

403
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,495
Rym: She's basically gonna kill them all.

404
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:22,290
Rym: and then one of them looks up and kind of zooms in on her nipple and you see this Vaguely face-shaped thing and they're like Tanaka.

405
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:26,284
Rym: No Like how could you recognize someone's face?

406
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:28,715
Scott: I Don't know but it's horrific.

407
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,864
Scott: And then what's the next thing he fights?

408
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:32,310
Scott: Was it the dragon dick guy?

409
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,053
Rym: No, that was the third guy the next one.

410
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:35,475
Rym: There's the there's the scary nurse.

411
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,100
Rym: But before that there's the big guy with the karaoke dick.

412
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,456
Rym: Remember this karaoke dick and dragon.

413
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:44,603
Scott: I watched a lot of this show from my mind.

414
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:46,969
Scott: You understand I tried pretty hard.

415
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:51,321
Rym: So let's zoom back a bit because you know, there's flashbacks all the time.

416
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:51,582
Rym: and what?

417
00:25:51,723 --> 00:26:01,954
Rym: what's weird is that in the flashbacks There's this these two guys who are learning to fight with these suits or whatever, but in the rest of the show One of them's a woman.

418
00:26:02,617 --> 00:26:03,420
Rym: There's no explanation.

419
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,110
Scott: Basically the guy has like what's a sister or a cousin or something?

420
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,498
Rym: They keep calling him mister.

421
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:09,290
Rym: I forgot everyone's names in this, right?

422
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,801
Scott: So the main character guy has some sort of sister.

423
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:13,489
Scott: who is the big bad guy, right?

424
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,618
Scott: You know who all has another suit of armor.

425
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:19,593
Rym: that's the same kind of suit of armor and he or she is the head of Tactical evil.

426
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:22,561
Scott: I think it used to be a she.

427
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:23,524
Rym: now it was a guy first.

428
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:24,587
Scott: It was a guy first.

429
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:28,618
Scott: then it became a Woman's body, but it's still a guy.

430
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:31,710
Scott: Yeah, and like it got tits, but it didn't cut off the dick.

431
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:33,810
Scott: Well, we don't know about it's a futanari.

432
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:55,830
Rym: Ironically, we never find out because toward the end when they're fighting the dragon dick guy when the dragon dick gets cut off Which mortally wounds him He or she then takes over that guy's body to fight the main character and notes the fact that the dick is missing Yeah, and that this is really inconvenient.

433
00:26:59,072 --> 00:26:59,513
Rym: The show's.

434
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:03,610
Scott: I guess if you're your best attack was the rape attack then it would be pretty inconvenient.

435
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:04,599
Scott: It's not a rape.

436
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,829
Rym: you don't use dicks for that.

437
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:13,892
Rym: the one dick is just a dragon and the other guy whiffs it off and Actually sings karaoke into it because it is in fact a microphone Mm-hmm.

438
00:27:14,795 --> 00:27:18,149
Rym: There's also the nurse who has the two dick tits, I guess.

439
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:25,145
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what's up with me Doesn't the nurse like tries to befriend them and then it's like oh my god.

440
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:26,130
Scott: It wasn't actually a nurse.

441
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,417
Rym: Well, she's trying to eat them with her vagina.

442
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:28,879
Rym: Yeah.

443
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,424
Rym: Yeah, this shows not safe for work.

444
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:32,230
Scott: It was not safe for anything.

445
00:27:32,471 --> 00:27:33,979
Rym: No one should watch apocalypse zero.

446
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,190
Rym: You should just read all the reviews about it.

447
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:38,209
Scott: I think what you need to do is you need to see it.

448
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:44,570
Scott: You should look at a still picture or a short video of any one of the horrific monsters in the show.

449
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:49,950
Scott: Right, and then once you see the style of any of these horrific monsters, you'd be like, oh I see that style.

450
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,134
Scott: Okay, then you're good.

451
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:52,578
Rym: The character design is pretty awesome.

452
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:56,490
Rym: Everyone has this continuously surprised look on their face.

453
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:02,648
Scott: Yeah, I mean like it is an OAV and that the production quality in terms of like animation is actually surprisingly high.

454
00:28:04,212 --> 00:28:06,282
Rym: The karaoke dick is really well animated.

455
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:10,841
Scott: Yeah, it's like woes Animated, you know, I don't know.

456
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:11,885
Scott: the thing is is no AV.

457
00:28:11,945 --> 00:28:13,330
Scott: So this is not on TV.

458
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:16,370
Scott: It was not in movie theaters, right and someone wanted to watch this.

459
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,046
Scott: That means they had to go to the store and buy it on I guess DVD.

460
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:26,810
Rym: if you watch this You must have already been a fan of Taka Yuki Yamaguchi's manga apocalypse zero.

461
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:31,910
Scott: Yeah, it's like who actually went to the store and bought this right intentionally?

462
00:28:32,492 --> 00:28:35,807
Scott: And then I guess it became big in the US because of the.

463
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:39,539
Scott: you know The 90s when it was all about, you know violent.

464
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:43,170
Rym: Oh my god, ultra violent anime was like the marketing technique.

465
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:45,690
Scott: Yeah, they just they're like, oh my god, you gotta watch this anime.

466
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,754
Scott: It's so violent.

467
00:28:46,774 --> 00:28:52,678
Rym: so people in the US bought it and that's the thing is I feel like, you know Watching vampire hunter D or ninja scroll.

468
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:55,890
Rym: Those were ultra violent but more in the ichi the killer way.

469
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:58,901
Rym: Apocalypse zero is this brand new kind of violent.

470
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:01,490
Scott: apocalypse zero is not in the same category as each of the killer.

471
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,334
Scott: What are you talking about?

472
00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:03,360
Rym: I don't think it is.

473
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:05,250
Rym: each of the killer is realistic.

474
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,750
Scott: How is it not in the same category as Ebola syndrome?

475
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,255
Rym: I for some reason they feel different.

476
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:17,427
Rym: the the way the violence is presented in apocalypse zero is so Just fucked up.

477
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:20,857
Scott: How is Ebola syndrome not fucked up?

478
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:30,910
Rym: because at least Ebola syndrome in the end the guy shoots the guy and I don't know Ebola syndrome kind of made sense from a plot perspective, right?

479
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:31,993
Rym: There was a plot.

480
00:29:32,514 --> 00:29:35,324
Rym: Okay, the guy went around infecting people with Ebola because he's a dick.

481
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:36,830
Rym: Yeah, that was the plot.

482
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:38,490
Scott: So is the plot of apocalypse zero?

483
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:45,287
Rym: No The plot of apocalypse zero is that this dude trains his two sons to wear this armor.

484
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:54,943
Rym: to train them He basically makes them badasses by fighting the tit bear and then he locks each of them in a room Naked with the armor and before he locks him in there.

485
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:57,798
Rym: He's like, here's the armor You'll figure out what to do.

486
00:29:58,462 --> 00:29:59,769
Scott: and the armor hurts really bad.

487
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:08,245
Rym: So we thought but there's this long scene where the guys laying in there in this room just naked and the armors just kind of Laying there next to him in the room and he's like, all right.

488
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,170
Rym: I don't know what to do now.

489
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:16,849
Scott: And yeah each piece of the armor he puts on causes incredible the whole time You're thinking is he gonna have sex with the armor?

490
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:24,585
Scott: You could say that he does metaphorically but then he's like I don't know where is a piece of armor that applies to the crotchal area.

491
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:25,369
Rym: I don't know what to do.

492
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:26,856
Rym: armor What do you want for me?

493
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,344
Rym: And then he touches it.

494
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:29,329
Rym: He's like you're so cold.

495
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:35,130
Rym: Should I should I warm you up and he starts hugging the armor and then the armors arm falls off.

496
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,002
Rym: He's like should I should I stick my hand in the hole where your arm just fell off.

497
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:42,910
Rym: Oh, you're nice and warm and it's You see what I mean?

498
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,833
Rym: There's nothing like that.

499
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:44,616
Rym: and you see the killer.

500
00:30:44,897 --> 00:30:51,779
Rym: each of the killer made me cringe because it was realistic this I couldn't even look Away, I was just like what's gonna happen next.

501
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,364
Rym: All right his dicks out.

502
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:55,070
Rym: Oh, it's a karaoke microphone.

503
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:56,096
Rym: He's singing.

504
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:58,529
Rym: I guess that's his power singing into his karaoke dick.

505
00:30:59,312 --> 00:30:59,813
Rym: Like you.

506
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:05,550
Rym: just everything that happens is so much more over the top than the previous thing that happened that you cannot help.

507
00:31:05,812 --> 00:31:08,290
Rym: But just you have to know what happens next.

508
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:10,514
Rym: Our doubt it goes.

509
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:12,119
Scott: who thought of this right?

510
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:21,079
Scott: because like no matter how hard I try I told you who did the Right, but it's like imagine if you're sitting there and you're like, all right I need to think of the most fucked up thing I can think of.

511
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:24,374
Scott: right you're not even gonna come close to this Right.

512
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:25,238
Scott: I mean like.

513
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:26,463
Scott: I don't care how creative you are.

514
00:31:26,524 --> 00:31:33,662
Scott: Find me the most creative person Like I don't know if I can you know, even something like the boys or preacher I get Garth Ennis.

515
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:34,329
Scott: be like Garth Ennis.

516
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:41,010
Scott: Think of the most fucked up thing you can think of the most fucked up thing in any Garth Ennis comic I've ever read.

517
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:47,890
Scott: Apocalypse zero beat that don't even come close to even the tit bear, right?

518
00:31:48,592 --> 00:31:57,426
Rym: So it's like, you know You're probably thinking much like with utana when we said the utana movie that yeah at the end It's just there's a naked car and you're like naked car.

519
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:57,949
Rym: What do you mean?

520
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,160
Rym: Yeah, that must be some sort of metaphor or allegory.

521
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,344
Rym: now naked car.

522
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,090
Rym: This is a tit bear.

523
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:12,062
Rym: yep But I Don't know even god damn it apocalypse zero.

524
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,150
Scott: Okay, like god damn All right.

525
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:24,937
Scott: So, you know, I don't know like I don't know if there's much more to actually say about apocalypse zero itself other than I'm glad it was only - oh, it's interesting.

526
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:26,123
Rym: had it been longer.

527
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:27,430
Rym: I would not have watched it.

528
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:34,070
Rym: I mean if this to the North Star were like that I would not have watched it but because it was so short It was like an achievable goal.

529
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:40,630
Rym: I looked at it and thought you know what I can without much expenditure see the entirety of this train wreck.

530
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,570
Scott: Yeah, it's less time than a movie and you're watching it with other people in the room.

531
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,475
Scott: So you're all suffering together.

532
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:51,670
Rym: and cool enough people were in the room who I would not have expected would have watched it.

533
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:55,589
Rym: There were people in the room who I thought would have been disgusted and walked out.

534
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:57,236
Rym: Nobody walked out.

535
00:32:57,497 --> 00:33:02,489
Rym: No, some people came downstairs and then went back upstairs Very quickly.

536
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:05,819
Rym: One person who will remain nameless walk down.

537
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,623
Rym: Like what are you guys?

538
00:33:06,683 --> 00:33:07,667
Rym: Whoa, my god.

539
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:17,253
Scott: and just walked away And that was the tit bear God, they didn't walk down for say karaoke, dude Or dragon dick?

540
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:23,267
Rym: or when he punches that the woman who eats the boys in the stomach and all those skeletons come out.

541
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:26,880
Rym: Yeah One of them is still kind of alive.

542
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,824
Rym: I don't know how that works.

543
00:33:28,044 --> 00:33:29,189
Scott: Yeah, they knew who it was.

544
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:32,360
Rym: It was Tanaka again, whatever.

545
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,810
Rym: I couldn't tell you the name of any character.

546
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:40,381
Scott: I could not tell you they have a single character in this show but there's I couldn't even tell you the name of like the hero guy.

547
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:45,221
Rym: there's something to it because it was shorts and Because it was crazy and it.

548
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:46,990
Rym: we know a lot of anime that do crazy stuff.

549
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,479
Scott: It's like going to Ripley's believe it or not.

550
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:55,710
Rym: You're just staring at some ridiculous thing But they Peter out like if they're long or if they're not always getting more crazy you get bored with it.

551
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:03,430
Rym: You're like, alright, this is stupid But because this trumped everything that came before every scene trumped the previous scene.

552
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:06,161
Rym: If you start watching you're gonna see it to the end.

553
00:34:06,181 --> 00:34:12,850
Scott: and but because it was you know They it's like it's weird because usually you start quiet and build up to ridiculous.

554
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:18,063
Scott: This starts out ridiculous builds up to ultra ridiculous in 80 minutes and then it's over.

555
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:21,899
Rym: I Have no desire to ever see more.

556
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:23,527
Rym: I've no desire to even look at the manga.

557
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:26,480
Scott: Nope None keep it away.

558
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:33,902
Scott: I Know all that needs to be known and more will not be will not be investigated.

559
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:38,072
Rym: Oh my god that the woman is On the cover.

560
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:38,695
Rym: I'm thankful.

561
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:42,389
Scott: This is an obscure OVA from a foreign land that will never see.

562
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,918
Scott: It will never be widely known across the world.

563
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,677
Rym: I have this sinking feeling that we're helping make it much more Well known.

564
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:51,748
Scott: it doesn't matter.

565
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:55,426
Scott: My only warning to you are they need to be warned.

566
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:57,361
Scott: you can't just you know What if they watch it by accident?

567
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:59,112
Scott: We're saving someone You.

568
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:01,639
Rym: well, actually there was a point that was made that was interesting.

569
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:08,582
Rym: while we were watching to a nameless person said and I quote Stuff like this is what made anime good in the 90s.

570
00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:10,229
Rym: No, it's not now.

571
00:35:11,992 --> 00:35:19,299
Rym: Argument actually made sense that yeah apocalypse zero God damn it, but it was crazy.

572
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:20,662
Rym: It is different.

573
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:22,807
Rym: There is nothing else like it.

574
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,764
Rym: and What got me into anime was that it was crazy.

575
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:28,286
Rym: It was different.

576
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:29,350
Rym: There was nothing else like it.

577
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:37,902
Rym: So there is a place in the world for things like apocalypse zero because you have to delve all the depths You have to go in every direction with animation.

578
00:35:38,323 --> 00:35:39,850
Rym: You have to make every possible thing.

579
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:43,482
Rym: Otherwise, we're gonna have a million moe shows and nothing else.

580
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:54,734
Rym: I Mean that that's the best argument I can possibly pull out of my ass for why apocalypse zero exists to prove to you that It can exist.

581
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,241
Scott: That's a that's a great argument.

582
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:56,723
Scott: You got there.

583
00:35:56,944 --> 00:35:58,230
Rym: It is in fact the apocalypse.

584
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:01,650
Rym: All righty, I think we're done.

585
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,038

604
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:27,153
Rym: It's the bridge of that belief one it's aptly named.

605
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:27,656
Rym: I want.

606
00:37:27,877 --> 00:37:28,479
Rym: I want the orb.

607
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:29,889
Rym: I'm gonna change your belief now.

608
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,474
Rym: change of leaf.

609
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:30,534
Rym: it.

610
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:31,883
Rym: belief is now I'm gonna go.

611
00:37:31,903 --> 00:37:38,007
Scott: I'm gonna go back and see if there's another way to get there without using the bridge of death Because really it's the bridge of death.

612
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:40,759
Scott: It's not the bridge of happiness or the bridge of long life.

613
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:44,540
Scott: It isn't quite the opposite and I refuse to go on it.

614
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,799
Rym: I love how even in the module it says the players will likely not make it past this point.

615
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:51,689
Scott: It's rage of that.

616
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:54,619
Rym: those rooms even tell you stay off the bridge of death.
