1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,226
Rym: It's Thursday, August 19th.

2
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:11,868
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:12,489
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,894
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:15,980
Rym: Tonight, Scott Pilgrim, the movie.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,252
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:29,610
Rym: I think I'm done buying stuff in person ever.

8
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,824
Rym: I gave the physical world the benefit of the doubt today.

9
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:35,210
Rym: I needed new patch cables.

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,690
Rym: I thought, you know, we bought the new firewire thing and GeekNights stuff, and I need all new, like, balanced quarter-inch patch cables to do my full setup the way I want.

11
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:48,690
Rym: And I figure I'll just stop at Sam Ash or rest, you know, the row over there with all those different audio stores.

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,179
Scott: You mean the row that's right outside my work?

13
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:51,909
Scott: I don't even have to cross the street to get to it?

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:59,248
Rym: Yeah, so I figured I'd go over there and just see if I could find what I needed physically, because one, supporting local business, and two...

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,418
Scott: It's not a local business.

16
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:01,729
Scott: Sam Ash is a mega chain.

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,110
Rym: Well, I went to all the other audio stores around there, too.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,270
Scott: Those are mostly just guitar repair guys.

19
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,190
Rym: No, they actually all have the same kind of stuff, usually cheaper.

20
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:10,516
Scott: I walk there every day.

21
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,649
Scott: I don't really see any other stores that sell that besides Sam Ash.

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:20,990
Rym: All right, well, you're wrong, but regardless, none of them had anything even close to what I needed, and I don't think what I need is that weird.

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,677
Rym: So I looked on Amazon, plenty.

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,442
Rym: I'm done.

25
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:24,830
Rym: I'm just not going to stores anymore.

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,790
Scott: Well, I mean, you probably... Your cables, you probably should have gone to Monoprice.

27
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,010
Rym: No, Monoprice isn't really good for audio stuff like that.

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,350
Scott: What are you talking about?

29
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:36,230
Rym: I need 90-degree to 90-degree balanced quarter-inch cables.

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,748
Rym: Did you look?

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,081
Rym: Yeah.

32
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:38,310
Scott: On Monoprice?

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,348
Rym: Monoprice was the one that had their whole customer database compromised, credit cards and everything, so...

34
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,014
Scott: Who cares?

35
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:44,769
Scott: What's going to happen to you?

36
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:47,609
Rym: I could get my credit card numbers stolen, be a pain in the ass.

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,510
Scott: And then you go to the website for your credit card, you push one button, and then you fix it.

38
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,501
Rym: Yeah, it'd still be a pain in the ass.

39
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:53,290
Rym: I also don't want to support...

40
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,650
Scott: Well, I mean, yeah, that's right.

41
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,669
Scott: Coming from you, the person's a pain in the ass to even just do a Google search.

42
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,290
Rym: I also don't want to support a business that has shoddy IT.

43
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,694
Scott: Well, you know what?

44
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:02,699
Scott: They have $2 cables, so yeah.

45
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,150
Rym: Yeah, they don't have the kind of cables I need specifically.

46
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:10,050
Rym: I did find what I need, because I could get away with using adapters.

47
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:19,337
Rym: I did, but adapters, the kind of adapters we're using now, are what caused Scott Suck in the past, because I tested it.

48
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:21,010
Rym: I found the bad adapter.

49
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,538
Scott: Uh-huh.

50
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:23,346
Scott: Are you 100% confident?

51
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,709
Rym: Yeah, there might be a...

52
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,570
Scott: Because I know there was a show when we just started.

53
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,209
Rym: Yeah, and I think that's a different problem.

54
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:28,852
Scott: Uh-huh.

55
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:29,949
Scott: When it come, we got all these problems.

56
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:31,970
Rym: We've had a lot of them for a while.

57
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,910
Scott: You're replacing a whole lot of parts, but the problem is still there.

58
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,738
Scott: What have I replaced?

59
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:36,030
Rym: Scott, what have I replaced?

60
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,630
Scott: Replaced XLR cable.

61
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:38,897
Rym: All right, and you know what?

62
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,290
Rym: The one I replaced was broken.

63
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,059
Rym: I threw it away.

64
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,688
Rym: It doesn't work.

65
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:42,325
Scott: Uh-huh.

66
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,069
Rym: The soldering all came out in one of the ends.

67
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,533
Rym: Uh-huh.

68
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:45,869
Scott: It's probably because you stepped on it.

69
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:46,673
Rym: Actually, no.

70
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,990
Rym: It was yours, and it was broken at your microphone end, so...

71
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,553
Scott: You know what I'm saying?

72
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:54,650
Scott: You stepped on it after you replaced it, just like you did with your DS inside.

73
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:57,429
Rym: The DS I dropped while I was playing Pokemon.

74
00:02:58,819 --> 00:02:59,169
Scott: On purpose.

75
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:00,013
Rym: Yeah.

76
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:02,529
Rym: I broke my DS on purpose to buy another DS.

77
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,210
Scott: Yeah, just like you broke the XLR cable on purpose to make you feel good about buying another XLR cable.

78
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,667
Rym: You realize, had my DS not broken, Daddy 2 PP.

79
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:19,392
Rym: Why would Daddy only want 1 PP when he could have had 2?

80
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:24,429
Rym: But that aside, we're actually bringing Carl Custer's coming over tomorrow, and we're going to do some audio stuff.

81
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:25,688
Scott: All right.

82
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:25,810
Scott: Okay.

83
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:27,830
Rym: I'm going to use him to recalibrate.

84
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,649
Rym: Yeah, I'm about halfway through recalibrating all the new equipment, and once they get the new patch cables, I can finish that.

85
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,890
Scott: You and your non-stop calibrating.

86
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,310
Scott: All right, you want me to knock it?

87
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,309
Scott: Maybe you should do something.

88
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,930
Scott: Calibrating is important, but you know what's more important?

89
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,400
Rym: Getting the flight for John St.

90
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,970
Rym: John to come to the PAX Late Show and be our guest.

91
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:46,930
Rym: That's a good thing to do.

92
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,154
Rym: I got that.

93
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:47,829
Rym: You saw my email.

94
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,373
Scott: All right.

95
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:49,430
Scott: You know what else is more important?

96
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:50,355
Rym: Let's see.

97
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,810
Rym: Getting the musical act for the Late Show, which I totally covered.

98
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,212
Scott: All right.

99
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:57,430
Scott: You know what's more important than... You know, less important than the Late Show, but more important than calibrating?

100
00:03:58,555 --> 00:03:59,146
Rym: I don't know, Scott.

101
00:03:59,207 --> 00:03:59,370
Rym: What?

102
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,272
Scott: I don't know.

103
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:05,710
Scott: Any of the five or six things you need to do, like get e-commerce.

104
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:06,226
Scott: Eh.

105
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,327
Scott: Or... Okay.

106
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,870
Rym: E-commerce is low on my list right now.

107
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,289
Scott: Pay me money that you owe me.

108
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,522
Rym: You owe me a lot of money, too.

109
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:13,149
Rym: You owe me thousands.

110
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,790
Scott: All right, so you haven't even calculated what I owe you, though.

111
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:16,904
Rym: It's over 2,000.

112
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:17,249
Rym: I know that.

113
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,678
Scott: I know how many pennies you owe me.

114
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,119
Scott: Exactly.

115
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:21,829
Scott: All right.

116
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:27,370
Scott: So if we went to court, I could probably fight and say, "Look, he doesn't even have records of how much I owe him.

117
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:27,798
Scott: I don't owe him

118
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:28,043
Scott: shit.".

119
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:29,708
Rym: You know what?

120
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,069
Rym: I'd ever sign any debt agreements with you.

121
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,482
Rym: It would be word against word, so...

122
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,986
Scott: Yeah, it would be word and accounting documentation and receipts versus word.

123
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,450
Rym: I haven't got a small claims court, but the thing is, I'm pretty sure that I do.

124
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,462
Rym: In the end, I'll owe you money instead of you owing me, but it's not going to be more than $1,000 or so, I think.

125
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,062
Scott: Uh-huh.

126
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,410
Rym: You owe me a lot of hotel rooms and some lights.

127
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,489
Scott: That is true, but it does not mean you should...

128
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:57,309
Rym: I mean, yeah.

129
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,528
Scott: This is very important, more important than calibrating, but you haven't done it in...

130
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,550
Rym: Why is it that important?

131
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,447
Scott: Because you owe me some fucking money.

132
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,197
Rym: How about?

133
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,190
Rym: I'll just give you like, I don't know, three grand, we'll call it even.

134
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,644
Scott: Okay.

135
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,190
Rym: Oh, so you're okay with just glossing over the details.

136
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,769
Scott: Plus, because the total that I've calculated is not much more than three grand, so if I can get three grand, sure.

137
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,050
Rym: But there's an unknown factor.

138
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,849
Rym: You're taking a big risk on what my calculation is.

139
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,649
Scott: What do you mean?

140
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,210
Scott: If you give a calculation of a zero, three grand is fine.

141
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,548
Rym: But you owe me hotel rooms since the... You don't even know.

142
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:31,722
Scott: You don't have it recorded.

143
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,008
Rym: Actually, I do.

144
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,835
Rym: It's the Katsu-Kan.

145
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,669
Rym: before the last Katsu-Kan we went to.

146
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:37,049
Scott: So the one I was sick at?

147
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:37,529
Rym: Yeah.

148
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:37,957
Rym: Yeah.

149
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,929
Rym: 'Cause that was the second to last one we went to.

150
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,410
Scott: So you just admitted how long it's been and you're the only one holding up this operation.

151
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,309
Rym: Yeah, it's been for fuck ever and I'm a lazy ass.

152
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,329
Scott: It's all right.

153
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:50,269
Scott: So lazy you can't even click a link to fix your credit card or do a Google search.

154
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,570
Rym: My credit card's not broken.

155
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,283
Rym: I would rather avoid.

156
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,809
Scott: Clicking one link is so hard.

157
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,829
Scott: Oh, Rand, we can't be bothered to click one link.

158
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,462
Rym: So, Scott, you got any news?

159
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,988
Scott: It's sort of it.

160
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:09,029
Scott: It normally would be thing of the day material, but I'm gonna pretend that this is a new development or discovery and call it a news.

161
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,750
Scott: But anyway, somebody found some coprolites.

162
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,230
Scott: Do you know what coprolites are?

163
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,029
Rym: I have no idea.

164
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,429
Scott: It's basically a poop fossil.

165
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:18,390
Rym: Oh, okay.

166
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:18,850
Scott: Okay.

167
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:19,652
Scott: So...

168
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,470
Rym: It took me a minute to parse all those words together to figure out what you really meant.

169
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:25,349
Scott: Yeah, so someone found some poop fossils.

170
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:25,909
Scott: All right.

171
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,670
Scott: And the poop fossils have shark teeth marks in them, right?

172
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,250
Rym: So clearly the sharks tried to eat the poop.

173
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:37,129
Scott: Well, the thing is, right, if the shark ate the poop, how can the poop is in one piece?

174
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,030
Rym: Shark failed?

175
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:39,187
Scott: Well, no.

176
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,390
Scott: Why did the shark... The shark didn't eat the poop.

177
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,609
Scott: It bit the poop.

178
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:45,944
Rym: Tried to eat it, realized it was poop, and went, "Oh shit, it's

179
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:46,269
Rym: poop!".

180
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,429
Scott: No, not at all.

181
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,669
Scott: So the thing is, it's like, okay, we know the shark didn't eat the poop.

182
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,810
Rym: Did someone make a shark tooth weapon and hit the poop?

183
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,310
Scott: No, these are old fossils.

184
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,990
Scott: These are like extinct sharks that are like ancestors of tiger sharks.

185
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,030
Rym: All right, so did some dinosaur make a stick and stick?

186
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,530
Rym: It's not that old.

187
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,050
Rym: Okay.

188
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,090
Scott: Do you know why the... Here's the theory.

189
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,528
Rym: Clearly I do not know.

190
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,490
Scott: Here's the theory on why the sharks bit the poop without, and it's kind of awesome, you ready?

191
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,388
Rym: Bit the poop.

192
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:35,649
Scott: The pattern of the bite marks and the fact that the feces were not ingested is consistent with a reconstruction in which, during an attack on another animal, the shark bit through the body into the guts and left tooth impressions or bit the intestines after disemboweling the prey and left the tooth marks on the poop in that manner.

193
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,730
Scott: But then didn't actually, of course, eat the poop.

194
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:47,290
Scott: And then the poop probably fell out of the intestine and then, you know, it had the shark's tooth mark in it and then turned into a poop fossil.

195
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,609
Rym: That's some fine detective work there, Lou.

196
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,450
Scott: Coprolite.

197
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:51,928
Rym: That's your news?

198
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:53,529
Scott: Yeah, I gotta give me some coprolites.

199
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:55,889
Rym: Put 'em on the wall?

200
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,429
Scott: Yeah, it'd be awesome.

201
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,305
Scott: People are like, "Oh, what's

202
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:58,509
Scott: that?".

203
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,595
Scott: I'd be like, "That is a

204
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:01,141
Scott: coprolite.".

205
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,790
Rym: That is something awesome.

206
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:05,509
Scott: Look how smart I am.

207
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,227
Scott: Why don't you touch it?

208
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:06,950
Scott: Lick it.

209
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,766
Scott: How you lick poop.

210
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:10,670
Scott: Now, here's something I don't understand.

211
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,290
Scott: This is probably gonna sound really stupid, right?

212
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:12,849
Rym: No, all right.

213
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,110
Scott: All right, the poop fossil, the coprolite, it looks like a rock, right?

214
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:17,850
Rym: My poop kind of looks like a rock.

215
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,430
Rym: It's just brown.

216
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,370
Scott: No, no, no, I mean, look at it.

217
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,228
Scott: Like, it's a rock.

218
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:24,710
Scott: It's not, it's not, I mean, is it a poop that gets-- What kind of girly poop do you have?

219
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,830
Rym: Mine is like a boulder.

220
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:33,990
Scott: Well, I'm saying it's like, is it a poop that gets hard over time, or is it like, there's a rock that forms around a poop, and then the fossil is the rock.

221
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,890
Rym: If it's a fossil, it's probably been replaced with minerals.

222
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,110
Scott: Okay, so there was a poop that got replaced with a rock.

223
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,789
Rym: Kind of like a petrified wood, I guess.

224
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,729
Scott: Yeah, but it's not actually the poop.

225
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:46,450
Scott: That is, it's not actually an old poop.

226
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:49,449
Rym: It's actually-- It's an object in the shape of an old poop.

227
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:51,090
Scott: Yeah, okay, good, all right.

228
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,709
Scott: That's what I, I just wanted to confirm that.

229
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,110
Rym: Kind of like a shaped charge in a bomb, it's a shaped poop.

230
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,349
Scott: Yeah, it's not, but like a dinosaur egg is actually a dinosaur egg.

231
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,790
Rym: Is it, or is it also fossilized, do you know?

232
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:01,770
Scott: I don't know.

233
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,390
Scott: I'm a computer scientist, not an archeologist.

234
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:10,910
Rym: I got something that'll generate, I think, more interesting, well, interesting in a more academic sense discussion.

235
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:15,350
Rym: So there was a law in California, in Rosedale, California.

236
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:25,189
Rym: The law was since struck down by courts, and I don't know what happened beyond that, but the law was interesting because it says a lot about where we as humans have become, or have gotten to.

237
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:48,690
Rym: The law prohibited in malls, it was actually a policy in this like shopping district, if you cannot approach a stranger, someone with whom you do not have a preexisting or current relationship, and proceed to engage with them in any conversation that is not directly related to the mall or its wellbeing.

238
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,050
Scott: Okay, that's kind of a, I don't think that law is constitutional.

239
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,228
Rym: No, why not?

240
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:16,629
Rym: Because here's the rationale for the law was people were in this space, this private space, and they were constantly annoyed by strangers who would come up to them and try to peddle or solicit, or here's the trouble, they would mostly be religious people trying to convert you, which wasn't in fact, like it didn't count as busking or anything.

241
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,250
Scott:  Well, here is my, the way you worded it at least, obviously that wasn't the actual wording of the law.

242
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,210
Rym:  The law was pretty close to that, the law was pretty poorly written.

243
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:28,990
Scott:  As you spoke, you couldn't converse with people.

244
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:35,849
Scott: Now the thing is, that would be a freedom of speech infringement, and Congress shall make no law, and you said this was a law, right?

245
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:38,306
Scott: So that would be unconstitutional.

246
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:55,890
Scott: in the eyes of Scott Rubin, however, they could have easily, and I would have been no problem, if the law simply said you may not solicit, because that is a regulation of commerce, and as we know, the Commerce Clause allows anyone in any level of government has the ultimate right to regulate commerce, period.

247
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,050
Rym:  So here's the trouble with all that.

248
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:03,610
Scott:  So they could have just banned all commercial speech amongst strangers, while allowing all other non-commercial forms of speech.

249
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,690
Scott: 

250
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:24,150
Rym: Here's the trouble, the thing, the law is poorly written, and that's kind of a separate issue, I think, the fact that societies and people, especially in America, will identify, like a community will say, X is a problem, and they'll say, we should do something about X, and they all agree, and they will, without fail, write the most vague, horrifying, constitutionally laughable law they can.

251
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:33,930
Scott:  They could have just banned all commercial speech by people who are not renting in the mall, and in fact, if the mall is privately owned, the mall could just make a mall rule, and have their own security guards--.

252
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:44,169
Rym:  But from what I can gather from locals, the impetus of the law, the reason for this rule, was that there were religious people walking up to people, and just starting conversations.

253
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:54,890
Scott:  Well, that's another problem, is that religion is a special thing, and in fact, it should be classified as commerce, because they shouldn't be non-profit, or given special non-profit status.

254
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,850
Rym:  Yeah, they should be non-profit, that can be totally okay.

255
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,630
Scott:  But even so, non-profit commerce is commerce.

256
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:08,270
Scott: So therefore, you could have banned the religious speech, along with the commercial speech, but the First Amendment actually has the word religion in it, and that makes that difficult to do.

257
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,240
Scott:  And the other problem-- - But if I was in charge, I would amend that.

258
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,422
Scott:  So

259
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:25,288
Rym: the other problem that was designed to deal with is annoying locals and homeless people who would just bother people, but not in such a way that they wouldn't stalk 'em, or yell at 'em, or scream at 'em, just come up and kind of talk at you in a really annoying way.

260
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,154
Scott:  Say go away?

261
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:32,750
Rym:  All right, and they kinda, maybe they do, maybe they don't, but they keep bothering everyone in the mall.

262
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:43,688
Scott:  At that point, they're harassing and/or assaulting, or who knows, there is some other law you could put into effect, or have rules without laws of the mall, and the mall security guards could do it, to handle that.

263
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:51,210
Scott: You don't need to have police and an extra law, where an existing law or an amendment to an existing law will probably suffice.

264
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,330
Rym:  So what if the mall had just had its own policy of no talking to strangers no matter what, inside our private property?

265
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,590
Scott:  They could do that if they wanted to.

266
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,827
Rym:  No, they can't, the court said they can't.

267
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,543
Rym:  Really?

268
00:12:59,563 --> 00:12:59,768
Rym:  Yeah.

269
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,120
Scott:  Interesting.

270
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:01,470
Rym:  Yeah.

271
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,230
Rym: But here's another semi-related thing.

272
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,430
Rym: So I took New Jersey transit--.

273
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,210
Scott:  I mean, 'cause if I have a house, right?

274
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,270
Scott:  I could just say, anyone who comes to my house, no talking.

275
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,190
Rym:  And, did you hear anything I said?

276
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,910
Scott:  Yeah, you went to the shore, you brought something home.

277
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:18,923
Rym:  Okay.

278
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:19,190
Rym:  Yeah.

279
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,010
Rym:  So, I had to go back from New Brunswick.

280
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,090
Scott:  Oh, right.

281
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:32,210
Rym:  Which, New Brunswick smells to such a degree, pervasively, that I would be very happy as a human being if I never in my life have to return to New Brunswick.

282
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,710
Scott:  I think you're conversing New Brunswick for New Jersey.

283
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:41,950
Rym:  No, no, no, because there are nice parts of New Jersey, and there are parts of New Jersey that do not smell the way New Brunswick smells.

284
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,849
Scott:  All right, so where are these places?

285
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,089
Rym:  South Jersey smells nice.

286
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,030
Scott:  That is not South Jersey, that is Delaware.

287
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,450
Rym:  I just said South Jersey smells nice.

288
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,290
Scott:  There's no such, no, that's Delaware.

289
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,183
Rym:  That's Delaware?

290
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:54,449
Rym:  Yeah.

291
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,950
Rym:  Why don't we just make it part of New York?

292
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,648
Rym: Why don't we just take it?

293
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,350
Scott:  No, that's North Jersey.

294
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,330
Rym:  No, but then it's like some sad borough, we don't want that, it's like Staten Island, the smelly borough in the corner.

295
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:11,708
Scott:  No, no, we're only taking the part that's directly, we're only taking like Englewood and those areas, and the metal lands.

296
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:24,830
Rym:  So regardless, from New Brunswick, I had to get on New Jersey Transit, which despite being far closer to the city than Trenton, the train took about the same amount of time to get home from there than it would have from Trenton.

297
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,070
Scott:  Yeah, pretty much only the path is useful, the Jersey Transit is basically Metro North minus minus.

298
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,810
Rym:  The SEPTA was better than the New Jersey Transit, though the train itself was comfortable, but everything around the train was disgusting.

299
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,448
Scott:  Yeah, just take the path, dude.

300
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:43,549
Rym:  So, New Brunswick, and I'm reading the sign, and there is a new policy on New Jersey Transit, it's an experimental policy.

301
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:54,650
Rym: There are, during all commuter times on every train now, quiet cars, motherfuckers can't talk, use cell phones, do anything that makes noise.

302
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,210
Scott:  Why does Metro North have that shit?

303
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,431
Scott:  I

304
00:14:56,471 --> 00:15:25,010
Rym: know, but in a way it's the same thing, look at what's happening here, and this happens all over more and more, people are making, like society can no longer deal with itself, and people, rather than kind of having social pressure to change social mores around them, they would rather legislate or have rules, because, think about it, shouldn't people just get the fact that all right, it's four in the morning, maybe I should be quiet on the train where everybody else is sleeping?

305
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,208
Scott:  No, because we have freedom, you can't tell me what to do.

306
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,530
Scott: So, and that's, I guess you don't wanna give that up, right?

307
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,450
Rym:  Yeah, but at the same time, freedom comes with the responsibility to use your freedom responsibly.

308
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:53,077
Scott:  Yes, but we have also, here's the problem, right, we have given people the freedom, right, and at the same time, we have taken away your right to hit somebody, so, therefore, if someone's being a jerk, you can't do anything about it, like when I was in that barber shop with the really racist

309
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:53,499
Rym: guy,

310
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,448
Scott: right, you can't do shit.

311
00:15:56,431 --> 00:16:04,910
Scott: So, the only, we can either get rid of the law and let us hit each other, or we can legislate to force people to shut the fuck up.

312
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,870
Rym:  I'm gonna use a pendulatism, the law is just government hitting in your place.

313
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,250
Scott:  Yes, but it is not actually knocking teeth out and making Dennis mad bank, so it's maybe saving us something.

314
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,690
Rym:  Is it, but I mean, is it or is it not?

315
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,570
Scott:  And also, what if, you know, the loud guy is big and the person who wants it quiet is small?

316
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,450
Rym:  Well, what if the loud guy's big and there's--.

317
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,410
Scott:  The government has the biggest fist.

318
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,570
Rym:  I think the biggest guy wouldn't win against 40 angry commuters.

319
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:36,489
Scott:  The thing is, the people don't even wanna, you know, don't wanna fight, I mean, even if you win the fight, you bloody your knuckles, it's like, ah, you don't wanna deal with that.

320
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,969
Rym:  Or it's maybe the conductor, maybe he should have the power to hit.

321
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,970
Scott:  Conductor should just be a policeman.

322
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,689
Rym:  He kinda is, in the fact that you can't hit him.

323
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,060
Scott:  I know, but you can.

324
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,189
Scott: (laughs) No, they should just make conductors also officers of the law, why not?

325
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,570
Scott: Is there, yeah, why not?

326
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,250
Rym:  Do you wanna give them the, I mean, that comes with a lot of extra power, though.

327
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,769
Rym: I don't know if we want that.

328
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,627
Scott:  What are they gonna do?

329
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,010
Rym:  I mean, theoretically, to become a police officer requires more training than to become a train conductor.

330
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,730
Scott: it'd be double training and they'd get even more money.

331
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,470
Rym:  See, I have this weird sinking feeling suddenly that train conductors have more training than police officers.

332
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:21,910
Scott:  We could do is we could just have, instead of making the conductor also a policeman, just have a policeman on every train, just one, maybe two.

333
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,329
Rym:  I guess it's more, at what point-- - I mean, sometimes they're on there.

334
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:38,770
Rym:  Do we, in a society where now culture is fractured and people in a physical place very often have very little culture in common, because their culture comes from the internet, comes from media, all these other places, so there isn't this common code of conduct.

335
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:39,509
Rym: Like, look at Otakon.

336
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:46,850
Rym: The people in Otakon, by and large, act the way they wanna act, and most of them are cool with that manner of acting.

337
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:49,289
Rym: And people like us are kind of the odd people out.

338
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,728
Rym: So we want all these rules to get those kids to shut up.

339
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:59,709
Rym: And yet, at the same time, at PAX-- - No, I don't want them to either, but we and the, our age, everyone but the two of us.

340
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:01,927
Rym: Meanwhile, look at PAX.

341
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:09,068
Rym: We don't want those screaming kids running around, and yet, notice how there are no screaming kids running around, yet there are kids.

342
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,730
Scott:  Well, it says, you know, the seven rules of PAX, we have those rules in place.

343
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,870
Scott: That pretty much covers everything.

344
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,550
Rym:  But at the same time, the rules never need to be enforced.

345
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:18,570
Scott:  They're enforced.

346
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,309
Rym:  There's-- - They're in fact enforcers that enforce those seven rules.

347
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,785
Rym:  You see punk kids running around, causing mischief at PAX.

348
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,330
Scott:  It's because the rules are actually enforced well.

349
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,530
Scott: It's not like US laws where they're selectively kind of enforced sometimes.

350
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,689
Rym:  See, you know, is it really, because I don't even see them, is it that they're being enforced?

351
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,690
Rym: Because there aren't rules about being annoying punk kids.

352
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,870
Scott:  Well, the thing is, right, as soon as someone, there is a rule that says don't harass people.

353
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,810
Rym:  Yeah, but it's not harassment to just be annoying.

354
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,130
Rym: To just be that fanboy.

355
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:50,947
Scott:  Yeah, it is.

356
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,070
Scott:  That's not harassment.

357
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,210
Scott:  If you're being that fanboy, but you're not talking to anyone or getting your fanboy on anybody, you're not harassing anybody.

358
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,770
Scott:  So if you go up to somebody--.

359
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,170
Rym:  So we should have a rule saying the fanboy can't talk to anyone?

360
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,810
Scott:  Well, no, if he goes up to, if the fanboy turns off his fanboyism, then it's okay.

361
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,285
Scott:  If he goes up and he says, "Hey, you wanna play Chez

362
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:09,529
Scott: Geek?"

363
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:11,910
Scott: And you just say no, and he goes away, that's fine.

364
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,281
Scott: But if he comes, he goes like, "Come

365
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:13,624
Scott: on.".

366
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,750
Rym:  So say he does that, Scott.

367
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:19,950
Rym: Are you saying that there should be a rule against that?

368
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,770
Scott:  There is a rule against that.

369
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,549
Rym:  What is that rule?

370
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,528
Scott:  Don't harass people.

371
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,710
Rym:  How is that harassment?

372
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,569
Scott:  He's bothering you, and you told him, you asked him nicely to go away, and he didn't.

373
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,269
Scott: You told him no, and no didn't mean no.

374
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:32,187
Scott: That's it.

375
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,390
Rym:  So what if he didn't ask you anything?

376
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,530
Rym: He's just standing next to you in line, and he's a really annoying, loud fanboy.

377
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,490
Scott:  Right, so he's just standing next to you in line.

378
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,710
Rym:  And he's talking to other people, and they don't like him either, but they don't tell him to go away.

379
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,448
Scott:  Did they ask him to go away?

380
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,890
Rym:  Yeah, and he's in line.

381
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,688
Rym: He's not gonna go away.

382
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,946
Scott:  All right, so turn behind and say, "Look, could you please keep it

383
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:49,168
Scott: down?".

384
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,350
Rym:  Okay, so he's quieter, but he's just as annoying.

385
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,904
Scott:  Hey, listen, really, can you just--.

386
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,470
Rym:  Can you, are you gonna tell him to stop talking?

387
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:58,725
Scott:  Why not?

388
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,090
Rym:  The topic of his conversation is itself the annoying thing.

389
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,490
Scott:  Oh, okay, listen, could you please change the subject?

390
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,230
Scott: It is grossing me out.

391
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,369
Rym:  No, in fact, you're bothering me by telling me to change my topic.

392
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,350
Scott:  He enforces me to just come and decide.

393
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:20,350
Rym:  So you want some sort of higher authority to enforce your personal view on what is and is not acceptable behavior when no harm is being done.

394
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,527
Scott:  Well, it's only because it packs.

395
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,430
Rym: I know the enforcer-- - You want them all to have the rules saying people can't fucking talk to people.

396
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,910
Scott:  No, it's just I happen to know that the enforcer will pass judgment properly.

397
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,665
Rym:  No, he won't.

398
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,569
Rym: You know what, look what happens at PAX.

399
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:36,187
Rym: Anyone who's annoying, no one needs to walk over and say, "Hey, stop it,".

400
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:43,509
Rym: because the collective zeitgeist of the people at the con makes people who are annoying feel uncomfortable and stop it on their own.

401
00:20:44,412 --> 00:21:03,369
Rym: I'm saying, I think, my moral is that society, in America at least, in the past, because the culture was more shared, and to a little degree, because hitting could happen much more readily, these two things combined kept very annoying people from being able to be annoying for terribly long.

402
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:10,509
Rym: And now, there are people, and I think we should bless these people because they're the ones who kind of remind us the price of freedom.

403
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,410
Scott:  Who dish out hitting.

404
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,085
Rym:  No, no.

405
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:21,330
Rym: The annoying fuckers are the people who remind us that freedom is important, because if we're willing to put up with them, we're able to accept the responsibility of freedom.

406
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:31,930
Rym: But now we've got people who want laws to basically stop the annoying people from being annoying, and we no longer have a tight-knit society that shames them into being quiet.

407
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:33,890
Scott:  Okay.

408
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,169
Rym:  So you suddenly have nothing to say about that?

409
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,390
Scott:  I think I'm done with it.

410
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,250
Scott: This has gone on for too long.

411
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,719
Scott:  Has it?

412
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:39,129
Rym:  Yeah.

413
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,630
Rym:  Has it really?

414
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:41,429
Rym: You liking my news to end?

415
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,768
Scott:  I like it a news to end.

416
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:44,909
Rym:  Did you show you like it a news to end?

417
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:55,920
Rym: Hey, listeners, you wanted the... Okay, so things of the day.

418
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,279
Scott:  You liking the thing of the day to end?

419
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,500
Rym:  Maybe after I do mine.

420
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:02,520
Rym: Do you have a thing of the day?

421
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,499
Scott:  Oh, you want me to go first?

422
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,357
Rym:  You can go first.

423
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,599
Scott:  All right, so I think I'm gonna turn the tables on Riff, and I'm gonna use a video from College Humor.

424
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,259
Scott:  Oh, shit.

425
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,500
Scott:  But the thing is, there were actually a whole bunch of good ones recently, so I don't know which one to pick.

426
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,238
Rym:  It's hard to say.

427
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:20,558
Rym: I mean, some of them are old, but it's one of those, if it's new to me.

428
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,560
Scott:  Yeah, I'm gonna think I'm gonna pick this one.

429
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,840
Scott: that's actually a College Humor original.

430
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,340
Scott: So it was made by the College Humor people.

431
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,640
Rym:  College Humor originals are really on the internet.

432
00:22:30,864 --> 00:22:33,620
Rym: They're like, pre-seeing, post-seeing is different.

433
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:41,360
Rym: I mean, anything that is good is good, but pre-seeing, on average, a College Humor original will beat pretty much any other random video on the internet.

434
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,160
Scott:  Well, they're professionals.

435
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,620
Scott:  Yeah.

436
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:50,800
Scott: But anyway, so this video, it depicts some metal dudes from Norway, and apparently, they're Satanists.

437
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:55,020
Scott: And they have pictures for Christians.

438
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,580
Rym:  Pictures for Christians!

439
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,337
Scott:  And they have many pictures that they want Christians to see that they think Christians don't wanna see.

440
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:06,559
Scott: Because they are Satanists, and they like Satan 'cause he's awesome.

441
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:08,439
Scott: And you should watch this video.

442
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,780
Rym:  It's pretty damn good.

443
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:12,440
Rym: Your video is not stuttering.

444
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:14,060
Rym: It is that way on purpose.

445
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,726
Rym: It is a slideshow.

446
00:23:14,747 --> 00:23:15,660
Rym:  That's Satan Club!

447
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,220
Rym:  All right, so there's a man, a very famous man.

448
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,478
Rym: I'm not talking about-- - Was a man.

449
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,928
Rym:  I'm not talking about Henry Earl.

450
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:25,459
Rym:  In Russian long ago.

451
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,820
Rym:  Because Henry Earl is awesome.

452
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,393
Scott:  He was big, thin, strong.

453
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:30,080
Scott:  And sad in a different way.

454
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,999
Scott:  And his eyes are flaming.

455
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,939
Rym:  But this is another Thark Park man.

456
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:34,820
Rym: And I talked about him before.

457
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:36,399
Rym: I used him as a newsworthy thing of the day.

458
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:39,440
Rym: His name is Tribbit, Patrick Tribbit.

459
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,720
Scott:  Is that his real name?

460
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,620
Rym:  Yes, Patrick Tribbit.

461
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,120
Scott:  His parents gave him that name?

462
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:43,960
Rym:  I guess.

463
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:47,019
Rym: He was the paint huffing guy.

464
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,318
Rym: You know that guy.

465
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,860
Scott:  Oh, that guy who had the gold paint all over his face.

466
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,400
Rym:  Yes, and the warrior's shirt, and the kind of crooked smile.

467
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:54,480
Rym: And then he was on Thark.

468
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:05,403
Rym: He's like one of the most, there was a little award that Thark made up for itself of the pixels of the gold paint on his mouth as the most replicated pixels from 2001 to 2005.

469
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,699
Scott:  So he is the new Henry Earl?

470
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,580
Rym:  No, he's been around for a while.

471
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,040
Rym: Him and Henry Earl were kind of parallel tracks.

472
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,958
Scott: Why don't they get Henry Earl and him together in real life?

473
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,539
Rym:  So here's the story.

474
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:21,020
Rym: This guy was sad and funny because of this picture of him in the warrior's shirt with the gold paint.

475
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:25,660
Rym: And he made Thark again later because his life was in shambles.

476
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:29,960
Rym: I mean, if you're huffing paint, that's pretty much the bottom.

477
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,019
Scott:  It's like you didn't even get enough money to buy drugs, you druggie.

478
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:36,800
Scott: You went to the Home Depot and you got a can of spray paint for five bucks.

479
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,880
Scott: 'cause that's all you could afford.

480
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,360
Rym:  I mean, you can't even get a crack pipe and some crack.

481
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,657
Rym:  So he saw the picture and all the fun that was made of him on.

482
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,540
Rym: Thark had cleaned up his life.

483
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,419
Scott:  How did he find it?

484
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,259
Rym:  Someone recognized him and showed it to him.

485
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:56,740
Rym: And he got help and there was this whole Thark article later and Thark was proud of him.

486
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:57,498
Rym: I was proud of him.

487
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:04,740
Rym: There were pictures of him smiling and running and working out and he talked about how seeing that picture made him realize how low he'd sunk and he fixed his life.

488
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,843
Scott:  Maybe all we need to do to go to rehab places is they just take a picture of you and show it to you after.

489
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:16,020
Scott: it just holds you in a room until you're sober and then show you what you looked like when you were disgusting.

490
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,578
Rym:  Him rehabilitating himself was my thing of the day like a year ago.

491
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,000
Scott:  Oh, I didn't remember.

492
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,820
Rym:  My new thing of the day is a picture of him from a couple days ago, arrested, huffing paint.

493
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,999
Rym: He looks so much sadder now.

494
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:33,925
Scott:  Wow.

495
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,560
Rym:  Even Thark didn't have the heart to make, well, one guy made fun of him.

496
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:47,080
Rym: It showed the picture of him, happy, smiling, running on the track, having fixed his life and they Photoshopped in a guy handing him some paint.

497
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:53,380
Rym: But the Thark thread was basically, wow, this is actually kind of sad.

498
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:54,858
Rym: I was pulling for him.

499
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,619
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, what does it mean?

500
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,720
Scott: I mean, do we even bother with the rehab?

501
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,800
Rym:  Recidivism rates are pretty high.

502
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,040
Rym: The worst part is I'm going to read, this is how sad it gets.

503
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,899
Rym: I'm going to read the last paragraph of the article describing this.

504
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:15,100
Rym: Officials say they don't know why Tribbett, who is from Wheeling, was in New Martinsville.

505
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,539
Scott:  Because that's what the Home Depot was.

506
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,639
Rym:  Yeah, and apparently leading up to this, he was arrested in several other Ohio Valley towns for huffing paint.

507
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,738
Scott:  Oh, he's from Ohio.

508
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,060
Rym:  Well, I think actually, I've got the answer to your question.

509
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,119
Scott:  Leave Ohio.

510
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,780
Rym:  Yes, leave Ohio.

511
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,259
Scott:  Go somewhere with something to do besides soft paint.

512
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:38,279
Scott: And look at your three buildings.

513
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,180
Scott:  Meta moments.

514
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,240
Scott:  You like the meta moments?

515
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,059
Scott: (laughing).

516
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:46,457
Scott: Meta moment, book club.

517
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,560
Rym:  Yeah, the book club is The Golden Apples of the Sun by Ray Bradbury.

518
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,655
Rym: It's a collection of short stories.

519
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,920
Rym: They're all science fiction.

520
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,040
Rym: Like I said, they are two to three pages.

521
00:26:55,462 --> 00:26:56,320
Rym: I think one of them is six pages.

522
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,279
Scott:  Well, how many are there?

523
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,080
Rym:  Like 15.

524
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,758
Scott:  Okay, that's not bad.

525
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,659
Rym:  It's a short book of short stories.

526
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,156
Scott:  What else?

527
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Scott: Conventions, packs?

528
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,557
Scott:  New York A&M Festival, New York Comic Con, Combo Con.

529
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,899
Rym:  We will be there.

530
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,839
Rym: We'll be doing stuff.

531
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,240
Scott:  There's 10, 10, 10, which I don't know.

532
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,940
Rym:  Also that weekend.

533
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,660
Scott:  Same weekend.

534
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,040
Rym:  Yep.

535
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:18,778
Rym: It's Thursday.

536
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,080
Rym: We're only getting into all that, but the PAX one's the big one.

537
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,960
Rym: We're doing our three panels.

538
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:27,360
Rym: And of course, the biggest part, we are the hosts of PAX Late Night.

539
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:30,180
Rym: We've got Alex Albrecht coming on the show as our guest.

540
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:30,718
Rym: We've got--.

541
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,358
Scott:  It's Albrecht.

542
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:31,756
Rym:  Yep.

543
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,640
Scott:  Eh, eh.

544
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:34,176
Scott: Not E, eh.

545
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,214
Scott:  I said ict.

546
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,120
Scott:  You said ict.

547
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,737
Scott:  I said ict.

548
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,658
Scott:  You said Albrecht.

549
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,540
Scott:  Albrecht.

550
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:38,995
Rym:  Albrecht.

551
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,731
Rym:  We've got John St.

552
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:42,436
Rym: John.

553
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,739
Scott:  Maybe we should've, I feel like we should've kept that secret, but then he put it in the con book, so.

554
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,579
Rym:  Yeah, it was in the con book before we announced it.

555
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,080
Scott:  Before we even had it confirmed.

556
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,940
Scott: It was confirmed today.

557
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,458
Scott:  Yeah.

558
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,080
Scott:  What if it didn't happen, but it was in the con book?

559
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,779
Scott: That would've been the worst.

560
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:54,660
Rym:  It was confirmed.

561
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,099
Scott:  We would've had to like start bribing him.

562
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,820
Rym:  See, the only thing that wasn't confirmed was I had not bought his plane tickets yet.

563
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,960
Scott:  Yeah, but you know, it could've fallen through.

564
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
Rym:  That could've fallen through.

565
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,706
Scott:  It wasn't 100% locked in.

566
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,720
Rym:  If that had fallen through, it would've fallen through due to Expedia and not due to him not wanting to come.

567
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:14,799
Rym: And we've got three of the Rooster Teeth guys.

568
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,178
Rym: And we haven't, no one has announced it yet, so I'm not going to announce it.

569
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:20,959
Rym: We have a musical act.

570
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:22,800
Scott:  Oh, we should-- - It's pretty rockin'.

571
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,898
Scott:  We should keep whatever secrets we are able to keep, I guess.

572
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,820
Rym:  That is, we have one more secret.

573
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,378
Scott:  I'll give you a hint.

574
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:33,980
Scott: It is not a musical act that is performing at a PAX concert.

575
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,520
Scott:  Well, well, well, well, the-- - At least not the Friday night concert.

576
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,260
Rym:  Yes, not the Friday night one, but I could foresee a walk-on on Saturday.

577
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:49,340
Scott:  Yes, but it's not, okay, it is not listed as being part of, officially a part of any of the PAX concerts.

578
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,959
Rym:  No, it is not.

579
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,740
Rym: In fact, while I'm sure that I've gotten this person a fancier badge, they had on their own--.

580
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,320
Scott:  You gave away that it was one person.

581
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,680
Rym:  I gave away that she is one person.

582
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,099
Scott:  Uh-oh, you're giving me too many hints.

583
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,360
Rym:  But I don't know if she prefers Kirk or Picard.

584
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:02,975
Rym:  We'll see.

585
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:03,513
Rym:  Yeah.

586
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,255
Scott:  Anyway.

587
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,980
Rym:  Yeah, we have one other secret.

588
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:15,039
Rym: There is a video that will be screened at this that no one in the world, except for the people who made it, have seen before, and I'm not even going to say who made it.

589
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,880
Scott:  I think that there may be another, there may be multiple opportunities to see this video at PAX.

590
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,118
Scott:  There will be at least two.

591
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,540
Scott:  But you're probably not gonna see it anywhere but PAX, at least not for a while.

592
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:33,147
Rym:  I would suggest you come to the PAX Late Show and then go to the panel where they will screen the same video and spoil it.

593
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,780
Scott:  Actually, isn't the PAX Late Show going to be recorded and then put on the internets in video form?

594
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:48,200
Rym:  It is going to be recorded Friday night and it should be streamed out, I'm working on the final details of that, Saturday night.

595
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:56,712
Scott:  So won't they be, people at home who are not at PAX be able to see this video and the rest of the Late Show and the musical act on Saturday night on the internet for free?

596
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:04,940
Rym:  For the first time ever it looks like if you did not get to attend PAX, you will get to attend at least one PAX event from the comfort of your own home.

597
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,419
Scott:  It will not be live but it will be slightly delayed and you will not have to buy a DVD, so how about that?

598
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,839
Rym:  So we've both at least now finally seen the Scott Pilgrim movie.

599
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,400
Scott:  Oh yeah we have, and it's a movie.

600
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,280
Rym:  Yeah, I still, I have no complaints about it.

601
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,220
Rym: to be perfectly honest, we're not gonna spoil anything yet but this is kind of our review of the movie 'cause we needed a Thursday episode.

602
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,140
Scott:  All right well you know, my general thoughts, I still like the book better.

603
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:34,864
Scott:  Of course

604
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:52,640
Rym: the comic was better, the comic was much more complex, it dealt with more issues, it dealt with them more elegantly, but at the same time the fact that they were able to condense all those books into one movie without making it feel rushed or feel like it left out something huge was amazing to me.

605
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,380
Scott:  It definitely didn't leave out anything huge, I think the only problems I really had with it were--.

606
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:03,359
Rym:  It simplified the theme and of course they had to not develop really any of the side characters, there's no way they could've.

607
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,820
Scott:  You know the things that I like most are the side characters, right?

608
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:08,697
Scott: And you know the thing is--.

609
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,900
Rym:  Well especially Kim Pine.

610
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,440
Scott:  Yeah in the movie, right, it really, as soon as the fights start, it's pretty much all fights.

611
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:26,659
Scott: Whereas in the book it's fight, chill, fight, chill, fight, and the chill parts are so much better than the fight parts, but the movie was just a big chill in the beginning, which is the best part of the movie.

612
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:38,200
Scott: But then it was fight with a little tiny bit of chill, but not enough, and then there wasn't really much between the fights, there was actually some during the fights, especially the first fight, you got all the action in the balcony, right?

613
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:51,199
Scott: But it felt like the movie just fell down and became all fights, which were well choreographed, they weren't the best fights ever, but they were still damn good and excellent and fun to watch.

614
00:31:51,703 --> 00:32:00,760
Scott: But for me to say, oh man, this movie was awesome, it would have had to have less on the fight and more on the hanging out in Toronto kind of action.

615
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,600
Rym:  Yep, but at the same time, could you fit that into a movie, it would have had to have been like Lord of the Rings.

616
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Scott: like a trilogy, maybe like two fights per, but the thing is, we now know that would have been a financially infeasible.

617
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:25,519
Rym:  I am kind of sad how poorly the movie's doing, but at the same time, I have this expectation that the long-term franchise of comic movie game combined is gonna make bank.

618
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:34,236
Scott:  Yeah, people have pointed out though, that you look at this compared to some other movies and it's like, ah, it's not doing well, ah, but you know what?

619
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:44,460
Scott: Compared to the other movies the guy did, the Shaun of the Dead and the Hot Fuzz, and the Hot Fuzz is pretty great, this is doing better than those, at least opening weekend numbers.

620
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,299
Rym:  Now I wonder how much of that is Michael Cera drawing hipsters in versus Scott Pilgrim people going in.

621
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,020
Scott:  I think it's a tough call because Shaun of the Dead, like how many screens was it on, right?

622
00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:01,276
Scott: Versus, you know, and the thing is, Scott Pilgrim's actually not really on enough screens, they said it was only on 2,000-ish, whereas usually a movie will be on 3,000-ish.

623
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,780
Rym:  Well I noticed something and I was asking some people, they seem to have only marketed it in major cities.

624
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,779
Rym: Like in New York.

625
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,100
Scott:  I thought the marketing was crazy because I see it fucking everywhere I go.

626
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,420
Rym:  Every cab, every bus, every bus stop in the subway.

627
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:19,657
Rym: I passed like four Scott Pilgrim posters on my way to work.

628
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:27,717
Scott:  Yeah, but we went to the movie theater in the city and it wasn't full, and it was only in one screen and it wasn't the biggest theater either.

629
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,700
Rym:  No, we went to see it-- - And we wanted to see like prime time, like Friday night.

630
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,300
Rym:  We went to see it in Philly, like Matt and A showing, we were basically the only people in the theater.

631
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:44,000
Scott:  Yeah, the thing is, I think the problem was they heavily marketed it in the major cities and people outside the major cities are saying that they didn't see any marketing.

632
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:48,860
Scott: So in the cities though, they had so many preview screenings.

633
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:54,680
Scott: I think everyone saw the preview screenings and nobody went to pay for the screenings afterwards.

634
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:02,239
Rym:  I mean, remember there was that contest from Midtown Comics, which I won, so I went and independently, like almost all our friends got tickets to a screening.

635
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:09,179
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, a lot, like a whole, almost everyone that I know on the internets saw some preview screening.

636
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,520
Scott: There were very few people who, I mean, a lot of people wanted to see it again, but that wasn't a majority, it was a minority.

637
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:19,900
Scott: And like, of the people I know who have seen it, most of them saw a preview screening.

638
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,460
Rym:  Yep, however, most people I've met who saw it thought it was fucking awesome.

639
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:29,379
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, I'm not hearing a lot of people who saw it say it was no good, which is usually the sign of a cult movie, right?

640
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:34,600
Scott: A movie where the people who've seen it go, oh man, that's the best, and other people just haven't seen it, you know?

641
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,777
Scott: There's not really a lot of haters.

642
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:42,699
Rym:  Though at the same time, there are a lot of haters, but they're weird, they're all haters of the generation that spawned the movie.

643
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:48,916
Rym: It's becoming like a battleground of our parents' generation trying to tell us how stupid we are.

644
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:54,880
Scott:  I don't know, the other thing about the movie is that, you know, in the book, best character, Kim Pine.

645
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,040
Rym:  Movie, Wallace.

646
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:08,540
Scott:  Yeah, well, the thing is, you know, Wallace, I mean, in the book, he was still the second best, but in the movie, he was the number one best, and then actually, right, characters that I didn't give two shit, not even one shit about in the book.

647
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,077
Rym:  Well, like Julie.

648
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,640
Scott:  Like Julie and Scott's sister in the movie, so awesome.

649
00:35:12,922 --> 00:35:13,478
Scott: Like, the best.

650
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:18,600
Scott: Like, they should've just made like, oh, you know, like Scott, sister, and Julie the movie.

651
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:19,620
Scott: That would've been so much better.

652
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,839
Rym:  I would watch that spinoff.

653
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,298
Scott:  I would watch that 10 times.

654
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:26,973
Rym:  The only line that was lacking was, no one yelled, "Smash her horsey

655
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:27,316
Rym: face."

656
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:31,195
Rym: (laughing) - And then the thing is, Kim Pine in the movie, eh.

657
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,020
Rym:  She was good, she served the purpose very well.

658
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,020
Scott:  But it wasn't even close, right?

659
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,420
Scott:  Well, because-- - Whereas you look, Wallace in the movie was definitely very close to the Wallace in the book.

660
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,700
Rym:  The best Wallace scene is that second text message.

661
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,399
Scott: How does he do that?

662
00:35:45,642 --> 00:35:47,398
Scott: (laughing) - That was pretty good, I don't know.

663
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:51,158
Scott: I mostly liked the, you know, the drunken Wallace.

664
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,860
Scott:  Yeah, and the-- - It was actually, you know, and the thing is, it wasn't just the scenes where he was making outward jokes.

665
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,240
Scott: Like, if you looked, like, I saw like, quite a few, he had some really good, like, background action.

666
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,817
Scott: Like, he would like, he sat at the bar once and just sorta like, fingered the bartender, like, come on.

667
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,316
Rym:  Yup.

668
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,839
Scott: (laughing) - But it's like, so it's not even in focus and he's making the funnies.

669
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,800
Rym:  But there was a lot of that in the background.

670
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,420
Scott:  I learned after the movie that, you know, that guy is actually Macaulay Culkin's brother, which is kinda crazy.

671
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,959
Rym:  Wow, I did not know that.

672
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,120
Scott:  Yeah, Scott Wallace is Macaulay Culkin's brother.

673
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:23,578
Scott:  Huh.

674
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,820
Scott:  Yeah, and he's really good at acting.

675
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,618
Scott: It's like, whoa, look at that.

676
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:35,639
Rym:  One big difference, and some people have complained about it, some people haven't, though, and it kinda falls into the fact that they had to narrow the focus of all the side characters.

677
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:48,140
Rym: This was real, the movie's story is really just the story of Scott Pilgrim realizing the mistakes of his past and becoming an adult and fixing all the problems that he himself had caused.

678
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,939
Scott:  Well, it's also the story of Knives Chow.

679
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,220
Scott:  Is it really?

680
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,840
Scott:  It's more the story of Knives Chow than it is the story of Ramona.

681
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,880
Rym:  But I think really it's the story of Scott Pilgrim and Knives Chow was his mistake.

682
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:07,760
Scott:  Yeah, but you know, you saw, like, Knives Chow had a full plot arc with, you know, where she developed, whereas nobody else really--.

683
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,700
Rym:  No, but she could have no resolution, and she could not advance as a character to her conclusion until Scott fixed everything.

684
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,140
Scott:  No, she had pretty much advanced there at the end.

685
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,660
Scott:  No, she advanced to becoming an evil ex effectively, but-- - That was fine, that was, you know.

686
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,360
Rym:  Yeah, but she couldn't get past that without Scott.

687
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:24,800
Scott:  Nah, she was like, it doesn't matter.

688
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:36,820
Scott: The point is that every other side character, you know, every other character who developed in any way either developed because they got killed and turned into a bunch of coins, or they were Knives Chow or Scott Pilgrim.

689
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,860
Rym:  I guess it's more that the story of this movie, which it kind of, because it was a movie, it had to be succinct.

690
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:45,220
Rym: It started with the Knives thing, and it brought that full circle with Nega Scott in the end and everything.

691
00:37:45,861 --> 00:37:49,279
Scott:  Yeah, well, I mean, Nega Scott didn't even really, he was just a joke in the movie.

692
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,340
Rym:  Yeah, but the Nega Ninja.

693
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,680
Scott:  Yeah, okay.

694
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,780
Rym:  That was good, it brought it full circle.

695
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,088
Scott:  It did.

696
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,840
Rym:  And it brought that DDR game in the beginning back full circle.

697
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,260
Scott:  Yeah, we should play the DDR game.

698
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,900
Rym:  I want that game, oh my God.

699
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,760
Scott:  Of course, it doesn't beat our mosh-mosh revolution.

700
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,440
Rym:  No, but if that were an arcade game, I would play the fuck out of that game.

701
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,060
Scott:  I would also play the fuck, but that game couldn't really work.

702
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,559
Rym:  Yeah, it could.

703
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,379
Scott:  I don't know.

704
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:10,878
Rym:  It could work.

705
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:11,939
Scott:  It'd be tough.

706
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:12,959
Rym:  It could easily work.

707
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:13,880
Scott: DancePad plus Kinect.

708
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,660
Scott:  It would actually be like an Xbox Kinect game.

709
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,760
Rym:  Yeah, DancePad plus Kinect.

710
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,420
Scott:  It wouldn't be so complete.

711
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,679
Rym:  No, you know how to make it complete?

712
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,280
Rym: Arcade machine.

713
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,660
Scott:  It wouldn't be so precise.

714
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,297
Rym:  Yeah, it could be.

715
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,060
Scott:  It couldn't be.

716
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,058
Rym:  It's better now, it could be.

717
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,760
Scott:  Oh, right, you were in the shore.

718
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,459
Scott:  Give it some years.

719
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,127
Rym:  You didn't play.

720
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:29,120
Rym: Tanks, Tanks, Tanks.

721
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,280
Scott:  What's Tanks, Tanks, Tanks?

722
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,419
Rym:  It's the new arcade game.

723
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,098
Scott:  Full of tanks?

724
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,453
Scott:  Yeah.

725
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,560
Scott:  Is it like battle tanks?

726
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,360
Rym:  I'll show you a picture.

727
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,219
Scott:  Is it just like BZ Tank in a box?

728
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,238
Rym:  It's versus tanks.

729
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,692
Scott:  Okay, combat.

730
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,980
Rym:  But it has a camera and it takes your picture.

731
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,000
Scott: My picture was-- - So does Mario Kart arcade.

732
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,140
Rym:  My picture was my middle finger.

733
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,099
Scott:  That's awesome.

734
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,311
Scott:  Yeah.

735
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,739
Scott:  Should have made it your penis.

736
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:51,540
Scott: Drawing off a penis and hold it up in front of the camera.

737
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,760
Rym:  So, we're gonna spoil stuff from this point forward.

738
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,259
Rym:  We already did.

739
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,780
Rym:  We're gonna spoil stuff for real, possibly.

740
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:04,020
Rym: So, if you haven't seen the movie yet or read the comic, stop listening and go do both.

741
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,997
Scott:  Yeah, I don't know.

742
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,058
Rym:  Yeah, but the movie at least--.

743
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,139
Scott:  Actually, if you can see the movie at this point, it probably won't be long before you can get the Dollar Theater.

744
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,240
Scott:  But the movie definitely-- - Money saving tips.

745
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:23,019
Rym:  Notice how the moral at the end was definitely, it was Scott overcoming his own bullshit and that was the primary story.

746
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:29,939
Rym: And in the comic, that still was the primary story, but it was much more complex and much more elegantly done.

747
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,539
Rym:  And all the other characters had similar arcs.

748
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,760
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, if you look at the, it's a lot more like an Urasawa comic, right?

749
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,400
Scott: Where, okay, Monster is about this one guy, but we're actually gonna split off and tell you full stories about other guys.

750
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,079
Rym:  Yep, Monster and every single character you meet gets their whole story.

751
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,000
Scott:  Right, but in, so in the Scott Pilgrim comic, in six volumes, you get, not everyone has a story.

752
00:39:54,140 --> 00:40:04,051
Scott: I mean, Julie really doesn't do much, but you got Envy, you got Kim Pine, you got some Wallace, you got all sorts of action going on with all sorts of characters and they all do stuff.

753
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:16,773
Scott: But in the movie, they basically shrunk it not by leaving out stuff like major parts, but by leaving out characters and basically turning them into side people.

754
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,479
Scott: Whereas before, they were sort of little less than side people.

755
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:29,716
Rym:  But still, I mean, look at the progression of Scott, say, in the comic, where it's, he is over, it's almost like him fighting the evil.

756
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:39,959
Rym: exes is an extension of him as a boyfriend or a potential mate, kind of overcoming the memory of previous people the person had dated.

757
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:45,759
Rym: You have to beat every ex-boyfriend of anyone you're going to date before you can truly date them.

758
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:47,999
Rym: That's kind of something everyone has to do in a way.

759
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:55,040
Rym: But at the same time, he was generating all of his own evil exes and didn't even realize it.

760
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,398
Rym: And the comic got into that really well.

761
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,959
Rym: Remember at the end where they kind of flash back to show you what all those relationships were really like?

762
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,020
Rym: His memory versus reality?

763
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:12,940
Scott:  Yeah, they didn't really, that's one thing they totally left out, at least for Scott, is the whole fact that he just didn't remember things at all in the comic.

764
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:15,267
Scott: And that was like a major thing, was like, he'd be like, "I don't

765
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:15,571
Scott: remember.".

766
00:41:16,805 --> 00:41:17,857
Scott: You're like, "Do you even know that person's

767
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:18,019
Scott: name?".

768
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:19,692
Scott: "Uh,

769
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:19,979
Scott: yeah.".

770
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,960
Scott: And he was like me, he didn't remember anything.

771
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,499
Scott: So in the movie, they didn't have any of that.

772
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,360
Rym:  Now I do think, however, the movie hinted at that.

773
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,780
Rym: The movie definitely pointed out everything from the comic.

774
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:37,060
Rym: Like every tiny little detail was there and it would allude to, every moment of it was referencing the comic.

775
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,980
Scott:  It's like they had a plate of bacon but they didn't actually make the bacon joke.

776
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,220
Rym:  But they didn't make the mistake that superhero movies often make, where they'll focus on stupid details and then make them important.

777
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:53,239
Scott: But the other thing is, some of the stuff that they put in there that you might have thought was out of nowhere really wasn't.

778
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,199
Scott: Like look at the part where the Seinfeld joke, right?

779
00:41:56,363 --> 00:42:06,800
Scott: If you look in the comic, right before they make that Seinfeld joke, there was actually some live audience laugh track in the comic, right at that spot.

780
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,177
Scott: So you can't be like, "Oh, they just tossed that in from

781
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:10,420
Scott: nowhere.".

782
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,020
Scott: It's like, well, no, really, look, you can actually see that was in the comic.

783
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,698
Rym:  It was a movie where, much like to use an anime reference, "Utenna,".

784
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:18,139
Rym: everything is there for a reason.

785
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:26,419
Rym:  'Cause like you point out, people are doing stuff in the background, like Kim does things and Wallace does things and they're not the focus, you might not even notice it.

786
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,020
Scott: like hanging out on the side, like diddling around with the audio cables and shit.

787
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,207
Rym:  Yup.

788
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,220
Scott:  You know, they put in a lot of stuff.

789
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:37,019
Scott: that was just, you know, they only had two hours, actually 30 minutes longer than most movies.

790
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,140
Rym:  But I note, and everyone says this, the movie didn't feel like it was two hours long.

791
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:42,138
Rym: It just flew by.

792
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,139
Scott:  Nah, it didn't feel, you know, it felt a little bit, it felt like, you know, a regular movie length, plus a little bit.

793
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,327
Scott:  But I think it was because-- - But it didn't feel long, like, you know, a long movie feels.

794
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:56,560
Rym:  Notice how the transitions were very comicky, instead of like the Hulk movie, where they tried to make it like comic frames and it just was terrible.

795
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,999
Scott:  I never watched, I don't know what movie that-- - Watch it on YouTube.

796
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,180
Rym: But look at Scott Pilgrim.

797
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:05,556
Rym: Instead of doing something meta, like with comic frames or something, what do they do?

798
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:07,520
Rym: Scene changes were just immediate.

799
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,558
Rym: Like suddenly it's a different scene.

800
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:13,939
Rym: No kind of buildup or establishing shot, just bam, we're here, bam, we're here.

801
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:16,536
Rym: Scott's daydreaming, now we're here, now we're here, now we're doing this.

802
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,960
Rym: They like cut out all the possible filler and just jumped from scene to scene to scene, breakneck all the way to the end.

803
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,460
Scott:  Yeah, sometimes it was like they would jump so fast, you'd be like, whoa, whoa, where are we going?

804
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,599
Rym:  I have to pee on her.

805
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,957
Scott:  Yeah, you do.

806
00:43:32,962 --> 00:43:34,120
Scott: Yeah, what else can we say?

807
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,519
Scott: Oh, let's talk about the music, right?

808
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:39,979
Scott: So the thing is, when I was watching the movie, I was like, well, what's this music gonna be like?

809
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,040
Scott: 'Cause you, right?

810
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,720
Rym:  I like the music.

811
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,858
Scott:  Well, here's the thing, right?

812
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,397
Rym:  Truck, truck, truck, that's been in my head for like a week.

813
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
Scott:  The Garbage Truck song is good.

814
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,979
Rym:  That's been in my head, I can't get it out.

815
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:53,240
Scott:  The song that I liked the most, I think, was the Clash of Demonhead song.

816
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,320
Rym:  Yes, Envy's song.

817
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,776
Rym: ♪ Hello, my friend.

818
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:56,080
Rym: ♪.

819
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,940
Scott:  And you know, the songs that, you know, Sex Bob-Omb sang, they were all right.

820
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,560
Rym:  Yeah, but Sex Bob-Omb is not supposed to be good.

821
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,840
Rym: That was kind of the moral of the comic, that they're not good.

822
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:12,900
Scott:  I went and I got the OST on the Pirate Bays, of course, right, and I listened to it, and you know, the Sex Bob-Omb songs, they were still all right.

823
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:15,020
Scott: And the Envy song was still really great.

824
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,699
Scott: But every other song on this OST is like, ugh.

825
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,820
Scott: Except, I guess there's a Rolling Stones song on there, but it's like, okay, whatever, big deal.

826
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,900
Rym:  But I did notice in the credits, at least, like all the songs that Michael Cero sang, he really did sing.

827
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,400
Scott:  Yeah, the other thing I noticed, though, is that the OST actually has all the Sex Bob-Omb songs.

828
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,560
Scott: I think they were written by Beck, right?

829
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,599
Scott: Like, they're his songs, they had him do it.

830
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,200
Scott: So they're on there twice, you know, once the movie version, once the Beck version.

831
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,404
Scott:  Ah.

832
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,999
Scott:  And that makes me not wanna pay for it, 'cause Beck is a Scientologist jerk.

833
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,017
Scott:  All right, yeah.

834
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,400
Scott:  Even though I like his music, he sucks.

835
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,678
Rym:  I always forget about that.

836
00:44:48,960 --> 00:45:03,239
Scott:  See, the thing is, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, because everything I've read about evil Scientology-- - Oh, if you're rich-- - Is that the famous people never actually see any of the evil stuff, and they have no idea it's going on, and I'm sure he would probably disapprove of it if he knew about it, but he's basically kept in the dark.

837
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,840
Scott: You know, he doesn't know about, you know, Lisa McPherson or the Sea Org or any of that shit.

838
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,379
Scott: He doesn't see it, it's totally hidden.

839
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:14,420
Scott: And he only goes to the celebrity Scientology center, where everything is like a palace and is great.

840
00:45:14,981 --> 00:45:21,158
Scott: So, you know, he just doesn't know that's going on, but that doesn't excuse him not reading the internets and seeing all the evil things.

841
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,879
Rym:  People like that don't, though, I don't think they do.

842
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,740
Rym: I don't think they touch reality that much.

843
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,336
Scott:  Yeah, I don't know.

844
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:33,520
Scott: But regardless, you know, don't give any money to that guy, even though I can't lie and say I don't like his music, 'cause it's good.

845
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,000
Scott:  I mean, Tom Cruise, I mean, some of his movies, really good.

846
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:36,575
Scott:  Yeah.

847
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:37,679
Scott:  All right.

848
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:42,918
Rym:  I liked all the little touches, though, like when Kim is just flipping him off.

849
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,260
Scott: (laughing) - Yeah.

850
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,940
Rym:  And you're right about the Wallace drunk scenes, though.

851
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,099
Rym: Like, when he comes in, he's like, guess who's drunk?

852
00:45:51,884 --> 00:45:52,780
Rym: That was beautiful.

853
00:45:52,900 --> 00:46:03,519
Scott: That scene was-- - Pretty much every, we should just make the Wallace movie, just all Wallace scenes, you know, every frame where he's in the shot, even if he's on the side of the shot or in the back.

854
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:03,807
Rym:  Yep.

855
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,500
Scott:  Just cut and paste and make that into a YouTube.

856
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,579
Scott:  When he like slides in with the skateboard.

857
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,159
Scott:  Yep.

858
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:08,654
Rym:  Here you go.

859
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:11,710
Rym:  Let's see.

860
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:14,730
Rym:  Also, one of my favorite moments was the first fight.

861
00:46:15,312 --> 00:46:22,490
Rym: I thought the comedic timing of that was very good, but then, when they actually did the Bollywood kind of song with the demon hipster chick.

862
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,269
Scott:  Yeah, what fight did you think was your favorite?

863
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:34,089
Rym:  See, the first one I liked because it had the I skimmed it and the demon hipster chick Bollywood number.

864
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:41,409
Rym: Second one was good just because the timing of Lucas Lee, like with the girls watching and the, and his eyes.

865
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,668
Rym:  I don't know, I liked them all.

866
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,090
Rym: Clashy demon head was just fucking awesome.

867
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:55,830
Scott:  Yeah, I think that, you know, the first one was kind of fun because it was the first one and it had all this, you know, crowd stuff going on and the, you know, the upstairs and everything.

868
00:46:56,771 --> 00:47:00,090
Scott: The second one was, which was the second one again?

869
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:00,969
Scott: All right, Lucas Lee.

870
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:07,610
Scott: Yeah, I mean that one I definitely thought was the most comedic, not in terms of the fight part, but in terms of just Lucas Lee was so awesome.

871
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,030
Rym:  He was, he's just like, hey, what's up?

872
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:09,688
Rym: He seems nice.

873
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:21,570
Scott:  Yeah, it was like, you know, for the comedy of the dialogue in the Lucas Lee area was amazing, but I think I would have to pick the, the fight with the vegan as terms of the fight action.

874
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,189
Rym:  Because of the high five with the vegan police as they're leaving.

875
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:25,499
Rym:  Yeah.

876
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:29,750
Rym:  That was go, the audience at the pre-screening lost their shit when they high fived.

877
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,188
Scott:  Really?

878
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:30,520
Scott:  Yeah.

879
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:34,630
Rym: The weakest fight I think was honestly the lesbian one.

880
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,330
Scott:  Yeah, I definitely, I think so too.

881
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:41,106
Rym:  The build up was good and the character was good, but they really just like, oh, we gotta get this out of the way, bam, doop.

882
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,550
Scott:  Actually, I also wasn't a big fan of the twins.

883
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:45,890
Scott: I mean, the music was good.

884
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,790
Rym:  The scene was good, but the twins were boring.

885
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,790
Scott:  Yeah, it was like, okay, you just sort of, you know, you didn't even talk about the twins.

886
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:55,290
Scott: I mean, remember the twins in the comic had the fucking super robot fight.

887
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:55,909
Rym:  Yeah.

888
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,430
Rym:  Come on, super robot fight.

889
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,370
Scott: Instead we got basically digital Pokemans.

890
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,270
Scott:  You know what we got?

891
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:00,888
Scott:  And not Digimans.

892
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,089
Rym:  We got what the Avatar movie should have looked like.

893
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,010
Scott:  Yeah, I would, they should have had the super robot fight instead.

894
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,249
Scott: That would have been way so awesome.

895
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,050
Scott: Thing is, I think it might have taken people out of the movie a little bit if they were actually super robots.

896
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:12,968
Rym:  I did think it was, it was neat.

897
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,910
Scott:  Because the movie wasn't, you know, to have a super giant robot, you have to zoom out, right?

898
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,430
Scott: But most of the movie was very in.

899
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,870
Scott:  It was very closed, there wasn't a lot of openness.

900
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,150
Scott: Even in the snow, everything was closed.

901
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,530
Scott: You had trees around, you had the fences on the rails of the stairs.

902
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,110
Rym:  I did though, I liked what they did.

903
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:37,649
Scott:  You're in the small apartment, you're in the, you know, in the coffee shop, you're in, they didn't do a lot of, they didn't even do a lot of Toronto street action.

904
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,650
Scott:  They were out on the, out on the street outside of the apartment, you know?

905
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:45,710
Scott: They didn't do the walking up and down the street situation.

906
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,910
Rym:  I did like what they did with the Gideon fight and how it happened twice.

907
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:49,910
Scott:  Yeah, it was all right.

908
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,690
Rym:  'Cause it let them kind of go in two different directions because, you know, love, all right.

909
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,908
Scott:  Well, if they would have gotten into like the glow and shit, it would have totally not made sense to people.

910
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,410
Scott: It wouldn't, you know, you couldn't get that across easily and people would have just been like, what the fuck?

911
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:01,551
Scott:  I

912
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:16,509
Rym: still think, I gotta ask Brian Lee O'Malley, look at the way in the comic, at least at the end, the thing, I'm gonna try to not really spoil the comic for people who only saw the movie, the thing with the people hanging, didn't that not look just like the Utena thing hanging?

913
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:17,550
Scott:  I don't know.

914
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:18,850
Rym:  I'll show you all the frames.

915
00:49:19,212 --> 00:49:20,850
Rym: I think there was some Utena inspiration there.

916
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:32,109
Scott:  I actually read an interview with him where he basically, he was like, yeah, when we gave the option to this movie, I expected it to suck and I, you know, I just wanted some monies, but then, hey.

917
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:33,364
Scott:  Yeah.

918
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:38,069
Scott:  It's like he didn't, you know, he let them option it and, you know, so he can get some monies and he didn't care really.

919
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,609
Scott: He, you know, expected it to not be good because that's how these things go.

920
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:45,069
Scott: But then when it actually was good, he was like, oh, well, all the better.

921
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:48,370
Scott: You know, I wonder how he, you know, feels about the box.

922
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:50,389
Scott: I'm sure it's not hurting his wallet that much.

923
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:54,010
Rym:  But it was good, you know, the first Gideon fight when they're like, what's the password?

924
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:54,870
Scott:  Yeah.

925
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,630
Rym:  That was great.

926
00:49:57,051 --> 00:50:01,228
Rym:  And then I like how they actually played the entire scene out again the second time.

927
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:02,790
Scott:  Yeah, with the passwords.

928
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,769
Rym:  Yeah, but then just so you could walk in and be like, your music sucks, your club sucks, you sucked, let's go.

929
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,749
Rym: I liked that, I liked that directness.

930
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,909
Scott:  Yeah, it was very good.

931
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:15,710
Scott: Plus, you know, it didn't, it took less time to be more direct like that.

932
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,550
Rym:  Of course, at the same time, it means I lost.

933
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:19,870
Rym: one of my other favorite parts of the comic is the whole thing with the cat.

934
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:21,790
Scott:  Oh, the cat.

935
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,050
Rym:  Just not, just at the end, when he's like, you were in the cat, you were in the cat.

936
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,650
Rym: He's like, cat, the fuck you talking about?

937
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,149
Rym: Cat's name was Gideon, then Ramona's like, what?

938
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,690
Scott:  Was the cat even in the movie at all, period?

939
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,750
Scott:  Yeah, they should've just had the cat like in the background in Ramona's apartment or something.

940
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,768
Rym:  If it was, I didn't notice it.

941
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,989
Scott:  Like there should've been just like, you know, a dish of cat food with Gideon on it.

942
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,330
Rym:  Maybe there was and I didn't notice.

943
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,429
Scott:  Yeah, you know, they gotta have something like that.

944
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,090
Rym:  But it's amazing just how faithful it was to the comic, at least like stylistically.

945
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:54,510
Rym: Like when they make out the first time, how the pose of their making out is the exact frame from the comic.

946
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:55,230
Scott:  Oh, absolutely.

947
00:50:56,171 --> 00:51:02,230
Scott: The other thing is that, you know, people seem to get this impression that Scott Pilgrim is like all video game references, right?

948
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:05,310
Scott: And the thing is, the comic really isn't that much.

949
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,470
Scott: There's a couple, you know?

950
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:08,590
Scott: I mean, the first one isn't even for many pages.

951
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:13,330
Scott:  Well, I'd say it is, but it's-- - But if you watch the movie and you haven't read the comic, it's just video game references.

952
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,250
Scott: I mean, there's some non-video game references, but it's constant video game references.

953
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,709
Rym:  A lot of the music references and everything were there too.

954
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:19,668
Rym: They're just-- - Yeah.

955
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,569
Scott: Seinfeld references, you know.

956
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,849
Rym:  The references in Scott Pilgrim-- - Anime, manga references.

957
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:30,469
Rym:  Both comic and movie are only there if you are knowledgeable about the subject matter they are referencing.

958
00:51:31,111 --> 00:51:33,209
Rym: They are non-obvious unless you know.

959
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,590
Rym: And the other thing is-- - I mean, who knows Clash of Demon Head, but crazy gamers.

960
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:47,170
Scott:  The other thing, though, is that I think that people, like, they might get some video game references, but not others.

961
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,549
Scott: Like, I don't think a lot of people have played and know River City Ransom.

962
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,849
Scott: I think it's not nearly enough, you know?

963
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:59,129
Scott: So, like, if you actually watch that, like, Kim Pine animation on AdultSwim.com, it's just River City Ransom.

964
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:00,870
Scott: That's all it is, right?

965
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,165
Scott: And I don't think people know River City Ransom, at least not enough.

966
00:52:05,032 --> 00:52:09,249
Scott: And River City Ransom is the one video game that Scott Pilgrim references more than any other.

967
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:10,417
Rym:  Yes, Simon.

968
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:11,270
Rym:  By a lot.

969
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,869
Rym:  It begins with a reference to it.

970
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:17,030
Scott:  I know, but people don't know River City Ransom.

971
00:52:17,872 --> 00:52:20,490
Scott: So, you know, like the one-up, they understand one-up.

972
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,085
Scott: You know, they understand DDR.

973
00:52:22,732 --> 00:52:26,770
Scott: They understand, you know, fighting games, and, you know, Street Fighter Versus.

974
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:29,850
Scott: But they don't understand River City Ransom.

975
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:32,509
Scott: So, they gotta, and not enough people do.

976
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,173
Rym:  The thing is, it's a movie that's enjoyable enough to where.

977
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,090
Rym: I'm glad I saw it twice.

978
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,647
Rym:  Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

979
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,370
Scott: Okay, I don't know if I need to see it twice.

980
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,790
Scott: There's plenty of other movies I can see twice.

981
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:48,310
Rym:  It was worth it, mostly so I could talk about it with people right after they saw it, because I couldn't say anything about it, I mean.

982
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:49,030
Scott:  Yeah, right.

983
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:50,930
Scott: Well, I'm glad I saw it.

984
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,148
Scott: I don't know if I paid too much.

985
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:56,910
Scott: It feels more like something that is, you know, this is definitely, it's like a Firefly situation, right?

986
00:52:56,971 --> 00:52:58,949
Scott: All the nerds like it, and then they sell DVDs.

987
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,970
Rym:  I'll qualify all my feelings.

988
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,787
Rym: I've said repeatedly, I have zero complaints about the movie.

989
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:14,309
Rym: And that is true, because everything I could complain about in the movie, the loss of the complexity of the side characters, all those things, it would have been impossible to make the movie and have those things.

990
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:19,629
Scott:  Right, unless they made, you know, multiple movies, but that was financially infeasible, so there you go.

991
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:24,350
Rym:  So for a movie, a single movie, I think it was as good as it could have possibly been.

992
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,570
Rym: I don't think it could have been better.

993
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,750
Scott:  It could have been a little better.

994
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:32,430
Scott: What I would have done is I would have actually, I would have made it, I would have done blasphemy, right?

995
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,590
Scott: I would have made it six evil exes instead of seven.

996
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:36,510
Rym:  Cut out the lesbian?

997
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,610
Scott:  Cut out either the lesbian or the twins, or maybe even both.

998
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:40,950
Rym:  I would have cut out just the lesbian.

999
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,586
Scott:  Yeah, either one, and then--.

1000
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,510
Rym:  But notice they kept referencing the lesbian.

1001
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:46,988
Rym: They had the lesbian poster up, they did the lesbian's joke.

1002
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,269
Scott:  Yeah, lesbian, lesbian.

1003
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,488
Rym:  He's like evil ex boyfriend, she's like evil exes.

1004
00:53:52,130 --> 00:54:00,000
Scott:  Yeah, but you know, then I would have put in more just, you know, hanging around Toronto kind of action, you know, and robots.

1005
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,869
Rym:  Now then the movie would have lost the frantic intensity that it had.

1006
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,530
Scott:  Yeah, I didn't need the frantic intensity.

1007
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,710
Scott: I didn't really, I wasn't, you know, I needed a break from all the fighting.

1008
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:09,530
Rym:  See, I didn't want a break.

1009
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,350
Rym: I just wanted steam, steam, steam.

1010
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:17,769
Scott:  'Cause the part of the movie that I enjoyed the most was the before even any fighting happened at all.

1011
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:22,170
Scott: So if they would, the movie, the whole movie would have just been that and there was no fighting.

1012
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,630
Scott: Oh my God, even if it would diverge greatly from the comic.

1013
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,890
Rym:  They could, in that case, they should have just made Scott Pilgrim the TV show.

1014
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,006
Scott:  Oh my God.

1015
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:33,790
Rym:  Just those people being sarcastic in Toronto.

1016
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,389
Scott:  Oh, it would have been so much better.

1017
00:54:39,491 --> 00:54:40,387
Scott: Animated, I'll take it.

1018
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:41,369
Rym:  I would watch that.

1019
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,630
Scott:  Oh, so much better.

1020
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,149
Rym:  Ryan Lee O'Malley, get on that shit.

1021
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,350
Scott:  Yeah, TV series, animated, just jerks in Toronto.

1022
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:49,227
Rym:  They could call it that.

1023
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,990
Scott:  Don't even make it like Scott Pelger.

1024
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:56,610
Scott: Make it like Young Neil and make a whole bunch of new characters who were just a jerky and then have like old Geezer Wallace.

1025
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:00,068
Rym:  What do you play?

1026
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,630
Rym:  Hey, gay guys, come on my lawn.

1027
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,189
Rym:  I think we're done.

1028
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:05,750
Scott:  We're done.

1029
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:14,330
Rym:  This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1030
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:19,450
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1031
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:24,870
Scott:  Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1032
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:32,468
Rym:  Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
