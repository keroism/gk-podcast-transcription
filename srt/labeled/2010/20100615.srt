1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,287
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, June 15th.

2
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:12,049
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:16,140
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight games involving bidding.

4
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,207
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:34,777
Rym: That's the best I can do with just my hands.

6
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:37,385
Scott: I thought you said you had a.

7
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:39,130
Rym: I do have one when I was a kid.

8
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,522
Rym: You see, you know weird weird facts from Rym's childhood life.

9
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,810
Scott: I can't believe this without any evidence being all skeptical.

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,873
Rym: I lived in Michigan.

11
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:47,980
Rym: I can probably find a picture of myself with it.

12
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:51,250
Rym: I had one of these stupid plastic trumpets.

13
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:53,457
Rym: It was the exact same one.

14
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:56,527
Rym: They're using in South Africa, or maybe it was the South American one.

15
00:00:56,567 --> 00:01:13,572
Rym: That's slightly crook I'm not sure but it came into my possession when I was in elementary school and I used to go to arena soccer games a lot in Detroit and At those games a lot of people would have those things and it turned out they sold them at the games next to like the hot Dog stand.

16
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:25,272
Rym: so I was a trumpet player and I convinced my parents to buy me one and I proceeded to be Horrifyingly annoying at all of these games forever because I could blow it louder than most people could Mm-hmm.

17
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:26,877
Rym: And also I think maybe South.

18
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:35,047
Rym: it's different in places where people have a culture around them and they know how to play them but People would buy them and then not know how to blow in them.

19
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:44,529
Rym: One of my co-workers - he was like what I thought you just blow now, yeah, you gotta go Seriously, fuck those things.

20
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:48,990
Scott: Yeah, I mean I like traditions and you know sporting things like that.

21
00:01:49,050 --> 00:02:01,415
Scott: That's my style, but I mean you got to have something clever like, you know in Europe They sang a song even it could be a clever dirty song like fuck the other team and Something like rip rip.

22
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:07,675
Scott: Yeah, but if you're just basically, you know, you could play a song like Drone.

23
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:12,610
Rym: it just never stops and it's so loud It is actually damaging to the hearing of the people in the audience not to mention.

24
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:19,056
Scott: There is also speculation that it spreads all kinds of disease around Spitting on everybody all the time.

25
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:19,818
Rym: We'll see.

26
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:20,781
Scott: apparently the mean.

27
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,909
Scott: if you just if you only played them when you scored a goal You know, here's the thing.

28
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:32,673
Scott: so all right You got fans of two teams in the arena or basically like even if they only played it when the other team had the ball And then stop playing it when their team.

29
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:36,120
Rym: What if you've got half fans of one team and half fans the other team.

30
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,130
Rym: Yeah, that's the problem.

31
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:48,430
Rym: But I mean as long as I'd fix this if it were anywhere other than South Africa Not enough people would know how to make it make noise and that would be okay.

32
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:51,890
Rym: The problem is everyone knows how to use the stupid things down there.

33
00:02:52,794 --> 00:02:59,003
Rym: The other problem is if they were constructed just slightly differently It'd be more like a bugle or you could play like maybe two notes.

34
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,490
Rym: two notes would be enough.

35
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,333
Rym: Well, I did.

36
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:03,301
Rym: you do do do do do do do.

37
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:05,370
Scott: during some of the games, right?

38
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,963
Scott: There was some drumming action you could hear and people.

39
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:09,450
Scott: they weren't playing multiple notes.

40
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,604
Scott: But what they would do is they would stop and start.

41
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:19,310
Scott: so you'd be like You know, they play sort of a song on it, you know along with the drumming section.

42
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:25,338
Scott: Yeah, but most of the people were just droning non-stop entire game.

43
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:30,430
Rym: Luckily the BBC, you know, they're not gonna ban these things or anything.

44
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,509
Rym: It's such a part of like the heritage and the culture of the game down there.

45
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:45,450
Rym: But the BBC I think said the co-worker told me this that they're going to Stop playing the ambient noise from the game accepted certain situations and just show the game and then play a commentary track.

46
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:45,872
Rym: And that's it.

47
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:46,715
Rym: Mmm.

48
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:47,698
Rym: We'll see if that happens.

49
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,930
Rym: We will see because apparently I saw someone was passing.

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,510
Scott: ESPN hasn't changed anything.

51
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,549
Rym: There was an mp3 that some guy was like.

52
00:03:55,871 --> 00:04:00,370
Rym: It's the anti sound of the sound and it'll cancel it out if you play it at the same time.

53
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:03,142
Scott: That won't work you don't think so.

54
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,389
Rym: it'd have to be in the same phase.

55
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:06,553
Rym: It wouldn't work at all.

56
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:07,215
Rym: Mm-hmm.

57
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:12,629
Scott: You couldn't just like record a sample and then you'd have to do a real-time like frequency analysis.

58
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:14,355
Scott: Mmm, what if you?

59
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,266
Scott: what if we put the game on like a two-second delay?

60
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:16,990
Scott: we could do it, right?

61
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:21,769
Rym: Yeah, it would not be that hard for some audio engineers to basically cancel that thing out.

62
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:23,278
Scott: I mean it would mostly can.

63
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:27,160
Scott: and then what they could do is they could have a little switch and Un-cancel it at certain moments.

64
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:27,884
Rym: That'd be great.

65
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:31,493
Rym: So they score a goal and just Mmm.

66
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:38,470
Scott: But all that aside they can even have a volume knob like how much are we gonna cancel?

67
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:40,982
Rym: Luckily, there are two things.

68
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:41,890
Scott: they can make it louder.

69
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,739
Rym: They could double it up to take heart with.

70
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,247
Scott: it can move the phase back.

71
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:45,850
Rym: the people playing.

72
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,475
Rym: These are not professional trumpet players.

73
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:51,850
Rym: So one they are cutting the fuck out of their lips and possibly causing permanent nerve damage.

74
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,694
Rym: They do that too much.

75
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:53,437
Scott: I don't think they care.

76
00:04:53,738 --> 00:05:06,252
Scott: Yeah, just same as people who go to like metal concerts that earplugs They don't care - or just light tap At the end of one while someone is blowing them will cause extreme pain Really?

77
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:08,219
Scott: Yes, even like what?

78
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:08,420
Scott: how?

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,861
Scott: so?

80
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:18,903
Rym: because basically you've got this thing up against your lips And if you're not like skill like a trumpet player has muscles and embouchure to be able to make the pucker I mean I can make the noise without even like having anything around my lips.

81
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:25,083
Rym: It's not loud, but it's there just So in order to make it make the noise.

82
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,629
Rym: if you don't have those muscles You got a really like push it into your lips.

83
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,770
Rym: So you've already got a lot of pressure there.

84
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,070
Scott: But maybe if these people go to a bunch of games and they every game they're playing it non-stop.

85
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,120
Scott: Maybe they got they built up the.

86
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:38,125
Scott: it's possible.

87
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:39,110
Rym: It is possible.

88
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:46,816
Rym: The thing is the more you abuse pressure Which is kind of like the quick way to make it work the less you develop the muscles and then you never really get anywhere And in fact you cause permanent nerve damage.

89
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:47,679
Scott: Uh-huh.

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,462
Rym: So we'll see.

91
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,609
Rym: do I only have to put up with this for one year?

92
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:55,848
Scott: Yeah, and for you Do they decide where it's gonna be in?

93
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:59,842
Rym: 2014 if these things ever become popular anywhere else in the world.

94
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:00,504
Rym: I don't know what to do.

95
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:02,050
Scott: I don't know either.

96
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,483
Rym: I don't think anywhere else in the world will bother learning how to make.

97
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:12,970
Scott: no I think that pretty much It's like they're using the tradition excuse here and even so like a lot of South African people don't even like it, right?

98
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,281
Scott: Yeah, any place in the world where it's not already a tradition.

99
00:06:16,682 --> 00:06:18,710
Scott: They can just ban them with no questions.

100
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:23,263
Rym: You know, there won't be any pollen storm actually had the most poignant thing to say about this.

101
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,467
Rym: Hmm.

102
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:35,309
Rym: I'm paraphrasing here I never thought I would think back on the days of something as innocuous as thunder sticks and wish we could go back to said Days, dude, I would take thunder sticks.

103
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:37,604
Scott: The thing is though thunder sticks, right?

104
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:43,868
Scott: They're kind of okay But imagine if they played the thunder sticks the whole game non-stop everyone thunder stick they did.

105
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:44,691
Rym: luckily It was.

106
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:45,836
Rym: it was so quiet.

107
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:49,149
Rym: thunder sticks are not nearly as loud as an angry hooligan.

108
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:54,884
Rym: One hooligan outweighs like ten thunder sticks unless you hit those thunder sticks in perfect unison.

109
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:58,349
Rym: Plus they break like right away It's true.

110
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:04,870
Rym: But over the weekend, I just want to mention this because it was totally awesome and we'll probably talk about it later.

111
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:06,078
Rym: maybe I'll do a show with Emily.

112
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:13,210
Rym: I want to have a board game con or a board game get-together at a Korean spa.

113
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:15,665
Scott: I don't think that'll work won't be board games.

114
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,350
Scott: get all night out.

115
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:23,359
Rym: So Emily and I over the weekend to try this out went to a Korean like traditional bathhouse Spa castle out by flushing and like College Point.

116
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,570
Rym: All right, so the way this this works really quick here.

117
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,274
Rym: It's kind of awesome.

118
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:29,767
Rym: So you go in and men and women go to separate areas.

119
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:35,350
Rym: You get a locker I get a little watch with an RFID in it that opens all the different lockers and things and it's pretty nice night.

120
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:42,969
Rym: I tech and you take a traditional Korean bath Which is a lot like the Chinese baths in the shower Or even a Japanese bath.

121
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:47,970
Rym: So they've got hot tubs like super hot hot tubs and cold tubs and you take the bath and shower.

122
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:50,730
Rym: You gotta be naked with all your you know, ever all the other guys.

123
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:51,715
Rym: But that's just the way it works.

124
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,343
Scott: a lot of old nasty guys in there.

125
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,670
Rym: Actually, you know, what's weird?

126
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:55,513
Rym: I don't know.

127
00:07:56,116 --> 00:08:02,181
Rym: Emily said that women's side was mostly just like older Korean ladies and like yeah That's that's what I would assume be old people on the guy's side.

128
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:04,130
Rym: It was like two-thirds.

129
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,038
Rym: It might as well have been packs.

130
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,489
Rym: It was like tattooed normal gamer looking guys.

131
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:14,130
Rym: Yeah, like people like me all right and then like a bunch of Korean really old guys with the balls out.

132
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:24,329
Rym: But yeah, that's what I expect mostly to be in those kind of players mostly you chill you hang out like they're talking and playing Games and you know, it's really relaxing and they were like a sleeping area and a TV area.

133
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:30,130
Rym: But then once you're all showered and clean and hot tub you get in the this uniform and you go up to the second floor.

134
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:37,090
Rym: Now it's co-ed men and women and there's tables and chairs and lounges and saunas and food and restaurants and all this stuff.

135
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:38,510
Rym: You're all just barefoot hanging out.

136
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,350
Rym: You all just spod for an hour or two and bathed and it would totally be awesome to spend a whole day.

137
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,429
Rym: They're like playing board games.

138
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,210
Scott: Why why I mean like the thing is like what's the point of the hanging out part?

139
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,582
Scott: I mean you could just go and take the bath and go home and hang out The traditional bath ideas you go.

140
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,190
Rym: it's part of the community like you hang out with me.

141
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:08,230
Scott: I mean, maybe if there was some cricket battles up there, you know, there's the equivalent You have to the third floor also co-ed whole bunch of pools Uh-huh and bar pool, I imagine they're not naked pools.

142
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,303
Rym: No, no, I mean the gender separated areas are the only naked pools man.

143
00:09:12,323 --> 00:09:14,270
Scott: We need some co-ed naked pools.

144
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,400
Rym: Yeah, I guess we could do that.

145
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,750
Scott: Yeah, it'd be awesome.

146
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,738
Rym: But I don't know I could foresee.

147
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:21,163
Rym: if you don't want to come you don't have to come.

148
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:25,503
Rym: but I think I'm gonna organize some Sort of crew get-together at this place because it was pretty badass.

149
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:28,172
Scott: I gotta go Gets.

150
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:29,480
Scott: I made the doctor's appointment.

151
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,229
Scott: I go to the doctor before I can do any pools.

152
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:33,270
Scott: I got some kind of fungus.

153
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,021
Scott: Yeah, Oh God Like where I'm my back somewhere, huh?

154
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:45,650
Scott: That's why I didn't notice it a minute.

155
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,257
Rym: Wait a minute, but are you always saying like you never.

156
00:09:47,277 --> 00:09:48,683
Rym: you've never had a fungus like you never.

157
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:50,149
Scott: I had one fungus.

158
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,139
Scott: now I have two funguses.

159
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,647
Rym: Okay That didn't expect that.

160
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:55,755
Rym: Yeah, okay.

161
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:56,359
Scott: All right.

162
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,182
Scott: Well, let me know when that's done and Got a doctor didn't give me an appointment until like July.

163
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:07,590
Rym: so it's like, uh, uh Yeah, I don't know if you should go to the naked spa castle and risk spreading your fungus to people like me.

164
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,115
Scott: I don't think it's a spreading fungus.

165
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:11,744
Scott: I think it's a a one-person fungus.

166
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:17,135
Scott: Okay, so 50 games Yes, the e3s, huh?

167
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:18,680
Rym: Oh, yeah, I forgot it.

168
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,268
Rym: You know, I was gonna make a joke like yeah, I forgot about it.

169
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,287
Rym: three three I really did forget about e3 until the news started coming out.

170
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:28,709
Scott: Yeah Really there wasn't a big lead-up going on.

171
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:31,961
Rym: Three is no longer a fan convention.

172
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,446
Scott: Like it never was a fan.

173
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,730
Scott: Well, I mean it was.

174
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,617
Scott: Well, I think that's the thing right.

175
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:41,690
Scott: is e3 was a. it was basically the only gaming video gaming thing.

176
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,582
Scott: so everyone snuck their way in and They technically didn't let fans in.

177
00:10:46,642 --> 00:11:02,269
Scott: but they you know they appealed to fans and the kind of things they had there and Then they shut down and then they sort of came back and now they think they've managed to make it a non fan Industry only thing mostly because things like packs have taken the load off for them.

178
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:04,055
Rym: Yeah packs is everything like.

179
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:08,108
Rym: it has everything I would have ever wanted out of e3 because the only other thing to get out of e3.

180
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:15,938
Rym: well, I guess two things are hobnobbing with industry people if that's the sort of thing you need to do and Getting all the news I can just see on Kotaku.

181
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:16,179
Scott: Yeah.

182
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:23,369
Scott: So really what e3 is all about now is basically Microsoft Sony and Nintendo all have press conferences at the same time.

183
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:25,115
Scott: Pretty much it.

184
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:29,730
Scott: but I guess other people, you know, like EA and Activision, right?

185
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,863
Scott: But pretty much that's all it is is everyone at this time.

186
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:40,610
Scott: We're gonna all do our thing at once okay, and they do it and As a result, there's a whole bunch of announcement type things.

187
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,118
Scott: I guess we don't want to spend the whole show doing this.

188
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,048
Scott: cover only the major major items.

189
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:48,129
Rym: So Nintendo made a game.

190
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:49,738
Scott: They made a lot of games.

191
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,689
Rym: Yeah, when was the last time a game came out?

192
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:58,740
Scott: I mean, that's the thing is they've had these same games like on the docket for a long time Like Golden Sun DS has been.

193
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:00,310
Scott: they announced that forever ago.

194
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,020
Scott: so we met right other M. they announced that forever ago.

195
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:10,147
Rym: remember when the dwee came out and they were like We got this Zelda game that was gonna be on the GameCube, but now it's a Wii game.

196
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:22,037
Scott: We were like, okay I wonder when the real Wii Zelda is gonna come out Now and not even it's gonna come out next year, yeah, maybe even holidays Holidays 2011 it could be.

197
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:23,784
Scott: you don't know why Nintendo.

198
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:25,470
Scott: Well, they're just so slow.

199
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:28,620
Rym: Well, it's weird how rapidly Nintendo is just like.

200
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,510
Rym: I mean, I don't know if they're still printing money.

201
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,970
Rym: Their sales definitely aren't as high as they were but the Zelda trailer wasn't even that interesting.

202
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,435
Scott: yeah, it did not look like.

203
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:53,795
Scott: it looks like it's probably gonna be like somewhere above the What's the one majora's mask but below the other 3d Zelda's like just judging from the trailer, which is not, you know, an accurate judgment at all, but The only.

204
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:55,850
Rym: how could the trailer be so uninspired?

205
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:02,854
Rym: Remember when they announced Twilight Princess and then like the first trailer came out and everyone was like all the Twitter whoo Look at that like it was impressive.

206
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:03,497
Rym: It was dark.

207
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:06,830
Rym: It was cool all these things and this one just looked like another Zelda game.

208
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:10,420
Rym: Yeah, I was actually and the music to be honest was kind of shitty.

209
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,830
Rym: sounding in the trailer like it sounded really like overly synthesized.

210
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,370
Rym: You think by now you'd think they'd have a proper orchestrated soundtrack, but that was crap music.

211
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:30,856
Scott: They you know, I'm no fan of like Metal Gear's really but actually there was the Metal Gear trailer at the Microsoft thing and that actually like Surprisingly impressed me with the cutting.

212
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:31,518
Rym: Yep.

213
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:32,782
Rym: Well, did you see that?

214
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:35,170
Rym: but can love blossom on the battle?

215
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:38,416
Scott: But I like that cutting action that was like that was.

216
00:13:38,596 --> 00:13:42,853
Scott: I was like, whoa, I'm actually legitimately Intrigued by your cutting.

217
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:48,607
Rym: it's funny how finally we've got all the effectively we knockoffs like finally coming to light.

218
00:13:48,988 --> 00:14:01,065
Scott: Yeah Microsoft one is technologically impressive, but it looks to me like I'd if I bought it right and it's gonna be like $150 if I bought it, right?

219
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,450
Scott: I mean Wii Sports was fun, right?

220
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,333
Scott: We played like the.

221
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:11,315
Scott: even the newer Wii Sports with the motion plus is fun, but it's like how I'm not in college anymore I don't have a family.

222
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:20,427
Rym: So even if I got it, I would play it so rarely, you know I think a lot of our listeners actually kind of have commented recently on how rapidly we went from.

223
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:25,049
Rym: the Wii is the best thing Ever - we have Xboxes and really it comes down to what we've always go.

224
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,766
Scott: Listen, anyone who says that can go listen to the earliest GeekNights where we're saying PC gaming is dead.

225
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:34,410
Rym: Yeah, okay So But now think about what happened.

226
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:39,627
Rym: We no longer have four people in the same physical place ready to play a Wii game all the time.

227
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:41,870
Rym: as soon as that happened There's no reason to play.

228
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:51,550
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I was living, you know in college still or with my family I would have a completely different, you know purchasing pattern, you know of what games I was buying.

229
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:52,998
Scott: I mean, I have new Mario Brothers.

230
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,110
Scott: I'd be rocking it with a whole bunch of people all the time.

231
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,250
Scott: We'd probably like stay up playing it for a long, you know, you know what though?

232
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,149
Rym: It's all gonna be good because Conrad it's gonna be living real close to us.

233
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:08,450
Scott: Yeah, but you know, we're already living close and we're not playing a lot of in the same house co-op type things.

234
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,000
Rym: Yeah, we're not really trying though.

235
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:19,070
Scott: No, well, you know But yeah, that's like, you know, I don't begrudge anyone though like about because in our day we had different games.

236
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:26,465
Scott: You know, we had DDR we had tribes - you know, we had Smash Brothers You know, they were out of strike, you know Mario Tennis.

237
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:27,330
Rym: I'm still playing.

238
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:38,630
Scott: You know we had the games for parties in our day and now this party games of the current day and the party games of the current day are no good to Us because we're not currently in a party situation.

239
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:49,170
Scott: But if you are out there listening and you are in a party situation, you're in college You have family members siblings to play with Roommates, right and you want to play video games.

240
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,470
Scott: Valsia Nintendo and Microsoft are providing, you know, awesome stuff for you.

241
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,075
Scott: You can play.

242
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,970
Scott: freaking that Xbox sports is looking good.

243
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:02,150
Scott: If you don't have a Wii, you know, you get so that there's no new Mario sports at the Mario volleyball at hockey.

244
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:04,089
Scott: That's looking like hot shit, right?

245
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,943
Scott: It's just no good to me now because I don't have anyone.

246
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:08,591
Rym: to be fair part of it too Is that?

247
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:09,756
Rym: look at the party games?

248
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:10,981
Rym: We still really really like.

249
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:12,990
Rym: I mean WarioWare on the GameCube.

250
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:15,081
Scott: Yeah, but how often do we play it?

251
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:16,649
Scott: Would you buy it if it came out today?

252
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,769
Rym: You know, I would if it were cheap.

253
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,375
Scott: Yeah, this is.

254
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:25,508
Scott: the other thing is that all these things are actually pretty expensive for what they are.

255
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,938
Scott: Yeah, like Nintendo games never go down in price.

256
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,670
Scott: That's the only reason I didn't get Mario Galaxy 2 yet because it's still 50 bucks.

257
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:35,769
Scott: I'm not paying 50 bucks.

258
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:36,935
Rym: I think part of it more.

259
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:48,086
Scott: the only game that I'm actually looking to actually spend money on are like Some Xbox live arcade games that are looking cheap Golden Sun DS and the Metroid one, you know saying the curvy one.

260
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:48,929
Scott: That's pretty much it.

261
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:52,981
Rym: See, I'm thinking part of it too is just that I Never bought the Wii.

262
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:53,710
Rym: So was it your place?

263
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,285
Rym: I imagined I would bring people over more to play it if it were my place, but I don't want to buy one.

264
00:16:57,305 --> 00:16:59,837
Scott: I Actually got to send mine in for repairs.

265
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:03,682
Scott: The disk drive has got the making a bunch of noise problem But they'll fix it.

266
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:04,348
Scott: I just send it in.

267
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:11,117
Rym: So maybe the trick is and I start organizing Wii nights and then just tell everyone show up at your place Then we show up and use your Wii.

268
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:16,750
Scott: if everyone shows up at my place to use the Wii I'll go buy a whole bunch of new party games and we'll play them all.

269
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,919
Rym: I think it's gonna happen because the what you're forgetting is seasons.

270
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,784
Rym: What season has it been lately?

271
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:24,010
Rym: nerd NYC's been bringing board games back.

272
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,782
Rym: So we've had this kind of constant low-level board game season.

273
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:28,310
Scott: I think it's role-playing game season.

274
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,559
Scott: We got some dwarf coming up in a couple weeks.

275
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:30,881
Rym: Yeah.

276
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:33,110
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely role-playing season.

277
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,029
Rym: I've also had a lot of single-player PC game season.

278
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:40,730
Scott: It's definitely been also single-player season for sure and also internet play season.

279
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:54,965
Scott: I've been playing Civ 4 I've been playing Super Street Fighter 4 games with the number four in them And then I'm gonna be I guess I'm gonna play Starcraft 2 when it actually gets released for not beta and then Civ 5 And then NS 2 whenever that happens.

280
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:55,610
Rym: Yeah, we're lucky.

281
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,130
Rym: I mean with basically all these games are just to keep us busy until Civ 5 and NS 2 come out.

282
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,885
Rym: Yeah, I've got all my eggs are in the NS 2 basket.

283
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:11,842
Scott: All right I mean there's a lot of items but we can we don't have to discuss them all but we do have discuss I guess the 3ds that we can't avoid that one right now.

284
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:14,290
Rym: I I don't think I'm gonna get one right away.

285
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:20,689
Scott: I don't think so either, you know, I didn't get the DSI and the 3ds doesn't look like I need it right away either.

286
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:26,030
Rym: Is the Kid Icarus game on it big deal, but the thing is it doesn't look like it's a platformer.

287
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,024
Rym: It looks like a Zelda game.

288
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:33,696
Scott: You know Nintendo released is coming out with a shit ton of platformers for the Wii so I can get all of those One at a time, but no

289
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:41,603
Rym: every screenshot of Kid Icarus looks like it is Zelda Just with a different skin and maybe more action and less, you know, Zelda II puzzles.

290
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,830
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't look anything like Kid Icarus.

291
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:50,659
Scott: I think they would have been better better off with something like the Picross 3d You know for the 3ds instead of for the DS.

292
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:52,084
Rym: I don't like Picross.

293
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:53,367
Scott: you suck kind of lame.

294
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:54,290
Scott: It's better than Sudoku.

295
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:01,388
Scott: Sure, I'll give you that It's the same thing only better.

296
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:03,616
Scott: What do you want?

297
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,750
Rym: also I do not like.

298
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:09,706
Rym: Now I will say we'll talk about the 3ds once we touch one.

299
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:17,285
Scott: Yeah I guess you can't really talk about it because we haven't actually personally experienced the 3d parts of it.

300
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:20,360
Rym: predictions though based on previous Nintendo bullshit.

301
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,189
Rym: here are my predictions.

302
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:26,690
Rym: Most games will not use the 3d or will use it in uninspired ways.

303
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:31,570
Scott: There won't be a great number of games that are using it in an awesome way.

304
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,674
Scott: There will be just a couple.

305
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,722
Rym: just ones that do will be first party.

306
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,272
Scott: Yeah, I mean look there's like, okay so the Wii?

307
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:39,942
Scott: which games really use the Wii for reals?

308
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:47,982
Scott: the two sports games and Yeah, and which games really use the DSI for reals?

309
00:19:48,463 --> 00:19:50,569
Scott: the one WarioWare do-it-yourself game?

310
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,378
Scott: and Which games really use the 3ds for reals?

311
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,729
Scott: Well the Kid Icarus game and maybe a couple others they come out with.

312
00:19:58,553 --> 00:20:00,283
Rym: The Kid Icarus game is going to add anything.

313
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:01,630
Rym: It's just going to be visual style.

314
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:02,213
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

315
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:04,285
Rym: The thing is it'll be hard to save the right.

316
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:05,130
Scott: Here's the thing though, right?

317
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,278
Scott: You can adjust the amount of 3D-ness, right?

318
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:12,810
Scott: So could I play that game on a regular DS or a DSI?

319
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,882
Scott: Or will a game only work on the 3DS?

320
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:16,949
Scott: They haven't explained any of that.

321
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:18,940
Rym: It's going to be a Gameboy Color situation.

322
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:20,950
Scott: It will be a Gameboy Color situation.

323
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:29,430
Scott: The thing is the graphics on it Regardless of whether they're 3D or not are vastly like PSP qualities, you know.

324
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:29,749
Scott: Oh, yeah.

325
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:33,548
Scott: So that I really don't think that 3DS games are gonna run on non 3DS.

326
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:40,499
Rym: The thing is until they have a killer app game for it and also now that I don't have a commute I don't need the portable system right away.

327
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,085
Scott: That is something that's actually right.

328
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:43,009
Scott: It's like all about.

329
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:48,906
Scott: You know determining which games are good or bad is really a lot more about your lifestyle, right?

330
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:53,422
Scott: When I was on the train DS games were the shit but like a Phoenix ride or something like that.

331
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:55,168
Rym: I had my DS with me every day.

332
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,838
Scott: Nowadays I'm riding the bike.

333
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:05,110
Scott: I can't even put headphones in Basically deleted like all the twit network podcast because I have no time to listen to them because I'm not honest even on a subway.

334
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:10,190
Scott: Anymore, you know, yeah on the subway probably in the winter I might go back and get some more podcasts again.

335
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:18,528
Scott: But now that I'm biking this I'm listening to like only a couple short Podcasts and they pile up quite a bit before I actually listen to them.

336
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:29,222
Scott: So DS games are pretty much, you know relegated to like bedtime and they're competing with books and comic books Which is you know, whenever there's a competition for like that.

337
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:30,245
Scott: It's not gonna work out too.

338
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:30,927
Scott: Well, yep.

339
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:32,152
Rym: We'll see I got.

340
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:37,130
Rym: I'm gonna wait too because Nintendo has a history of making a slightly better version.

341
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:42,455
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is I you know, I have so many Unplayed video games.

342
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:46,250
Scott: I'm just gonna be really slow to buy any more until I finish the ones I got.

343
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,562
Scott: I'm like really, you know reeling back.

344
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:53,944
Scott: Well, I'm having this anything Anything that does not have immediate multiplayer needs like NS2.

345
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:55,490
Scott: I'm like waiting forever.

346
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,745
Scott: It'll be five bucks on Steam eventually.

347
00:21:57,806 --> 00:22:02,795
Rym: media lately Like I don't because the thing it was weird is now that we live in the city We have a lot more free time.

348
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,445
Rym: Like I consume way more media than I was before.

349
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:11,447
Rym: Yeah, and yet Media is piling up like in the last two months faster than has ever piled up in my life.

350
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:11,888
Rym: Mm-hmm.

351
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,095
Rym: So I think it's a very recent.

352
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:17,566
Scott: this isn't even like counting anything that is illegally obtained.

353
00:22:17,606 --> 00:22:18,529
Scott: This is only like.

354
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:30,158
Scott: This is like free streaming animes on the internets that are legal, you know comic books that I paid for video games I paid for Piling up books I've paid for.

355
00:22:30,178 --> 00:22:31,081
Scott: I think about that.

356
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,967
Scott: like a book is like is the worst.

357
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:39,910
Scott: because you buy a book It's like six bucks and it's gonna take you a good week of like reading before bed to finish a book.

358
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:45,789
Scott: I don't know and I can get that that offsets a lot of other medias.

359
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:50,038
Rym: I We should at least mention a couple other things.

360
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,906
Rym: a Donkey Kong coming back.

361
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:52,830
Scott: It's Donkey Kong.

362
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:58,588
Scott: They had a lot of platformers and the one I'm I'm thinking about is the Kirby one that looks I like Kirby's a man.

363
00:22:59,233 --> 00:22:59,817
Rym: Donkey Kong is.

364
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:04,038
Rym: when Donkey Kong Country first came out like way back in the day I never really liked those games that like it either.

365
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:07,210
Rym: I remember like everyone I knew lost their shit about that game.

366
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:11,230
Rym: So I was like, alright and I rented it cuz I didn't buy games unless they were good.

367
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,540
Scott: It was alright, but it was not a huge fan.

368
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,790
Rym: It was like an okay platformer with good graphics.

369
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:17,997
Rym: Yeah, like it didn't blow me away.

370
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:18,559
Rym: I didn't.

371
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:22,230
Rym: I never to this day understood why so many people liked Donkey Kong.

372
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,484
Scott: 64 was actually alright.

373
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:28,054
Scott: Yeah, it was People.

374
00:23:28,154 --> 00:23:31,170
Rym: people are talking about epic Mickey, but there's nothing else like new about that.

375
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:41,989
Scott: I think Mickey has some good styling But it seems like it seems to me based on what I've seen that it's sort of like Gonna be some Okami action with the painting and unpainting.

376
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,915
Scott: Yeah, a lot of manual labor.

377
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:49,670
Scott: and it also seems to me like member Mario Sunshine where it has like cool parts.

378
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:51,950
Scott: But the whole game isn't cool parts, right?

379
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,750
Scott: Like they showed a part where is all side-scrolling steamboat Willie.

380
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,278
Scott: But the whole thing isn't clever like that.

381
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:58,522
Scott: Most of it is not that.

382
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:04,361
Scott: well someone you know, they these people they're so creative They come up with like a clever part in a game like in Mario Sunshine.

383
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:07,974
Scott: There was the old-school clever part That should have been the game.

384
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:08,576
Scott: that shit.

385
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:11,626
Scott: just make that the whole goddamn game clever shit.

386
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:12,770
Scott: get rid of the other stuff.

387
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:21,904
Scott: Make it only the clever part and if you come up with just clever part after clever part pile them on top of each Other one after the other and make that the whole game.

388
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:23,330
Scott: don't put anything else in there.

389
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,470
Scott: I actually think the sonic people have you seen this sonic colors thing?

390
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:38,437
Scott: Yeah, I think they figured it out after their stupid sonic werewolf shit and it seems like they're making a game Half the good part of the sonic werewolf game and half Actual 2d sonic.

391
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:43,217
Scott: they replaced the werewolf with old-school, you know And I think that might actually be something.

392
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:44,763
Scott: let's keep an eyeball on if you

393
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:56,090
Rym: have a game that has a glue area Because I think the glue area like once it rose to or like the center area like in Mario Galaxy Like always go back to the home planet or go back to the fucking time palace, whatever.

394
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:56,492
Rym: Mm-hmm.

395
00:24:56,833 --> 00:25:01,728
Rym: anytime you've got something like that like some kind of meta construct over your game.

396
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:11,487
Rym: Your game had better be damn good and that part had better be engaging or 99% of players are just pissed off every time they're there trying to get to the game again.

397
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:13,653
Scott: Yeah Pretty much.

398
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:15,883
Rym: and last but not least.

399
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:17,370
Rym: What do we always say?

400
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,170
Rym: Why don't they just make a golden eye again and they're making a golden eye again?

401
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,732
Scott: I don't.

402
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,129
Rym: I never said that I we said it on the show a bunch of times.

403
00:25:23,752 --> 00:25:27,084
Scott: I think that this pretty much this game is not looking too little too late.

404
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:28,610
Scott: I don't think this is ten years ago.

405
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,455
Scott: I don't think this is looking very promising.

406
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:34,367
Scott: I mean, it's gonna be a console FPS, which is already bad.

407
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:38,350
Scott: It's You know, is it gonna be able to compete with the other?

408
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:43,650
Scott: Well, but I don't think it's depending completely on the license property.

409
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:48,910
Rym: No, it is also depending on nostalgia for the other golden eye game.

410
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:56,141
Rym: yeah, here is how it could be a good game if they made it really really simple and They made it pretty much.

411
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:57,790
Rym: I think I have a single player with original golden.

412
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,271
Rym: I was real simple exactly if they made it just an updated version of the original golden I were.

413
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:08,510
Rym: the primary purpose of the game is to have four player or more straight-up direct deathmatch.

414
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:12,468
Scott: but why would you get that when you could get like halos instead?

415
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,134
Rym: I Feel like this could be a more.

416
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:19,330
Scott: it's like a low is pretty much the you know, replaced golden eye a long time ago.

417
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:31,014
Rym: yeah, but if you made this like a cross between that style of game and more like Counter-strike because remember golden I was much more about ambushing someone and not so much about Halo.

418
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:31,255
Scott: golden.

419
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:35,090
Scott: I are pretty much the same thing except for the the the you know, the actual theme.

420
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:36,415
Rym: No, I actually disagree.

421
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:37,619
Rym: Do you remember playing golden?

422
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,590
Rym: I it was pretty much strafe and then hit him with the moonraker laser.

423
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,198
Scott: No, it was more like RCP 90.

424
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:48,375
Rym: hold it down now and you had the thing aimed at head level always And odd job played you quit.

425
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:59,502
Scott: I Never liked it as a kid because I had quake We I played gold nye, you know friends houses and it was.

426
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:01,270
Scott: it was you know a thing of its day.

427
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:04,522
Scott: It wasn't something that was you know, it wasn't timeless.

428
00:27:04,843 --> 00:27:06,630
Scott: It's not something you can go back to now.

429
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,306
Rym: It was only good when I could played it back with something that was good in the moment.

430
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:16,130
Rym: at the time I'm in the situation never land, but we can have an n64 in a TV and golden eye.

431
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,898
Rym: Yeah, you play deathmatch late into the night.

432
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:19,406
Scott: exactly you go to a friend's house.

433
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:21,669
Scott: You'd be like oh shit We don't have four computers.

434
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,392
Scott: It's not like.

435
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:25,825
Scott: you know, a computer was holy shit and a lot of people's computers couldn't.

436
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:34,890
Scott: he didn't even have 3d yet But you could have four controllers in it, you know thing so is much more accessible, but now right you have steam.

437
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:35,954
Scott: So what the hell?

438
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,260
Scott: and you have Xbox Live?

439
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,907
Scott: So who wants golden eye?

440
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:39,590
Scott: nobody?

441
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,214
Rym: But anyway things of the day since golden eye is back supposedly.

442
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:52,258
Rym: Well, I guess not supposedly.

443
00:27:52,318 --> 00:27:52,880
Rym: now it's for real.

444
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,249
Rym: I don't know if anyone saw.

445
00:27:54,269 --> 00:28:03,548
Rym: this is an old College Humor thing But I think Kotaku linked to it either because they were reminded or something, but college humor did a pretty good Take on golden.

446
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:04,835
Rym: I actually enjoy this quite a bit.

447
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:06,366
Rym: That's it I don't know.

448
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,022
Rym: I mean, I don't want to spoil it Just watch it.

449
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:12,920
Rym: and if you've never played golden eye for the n64, this really isn't funny.

450
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,530
Scott: Okay, so basically here's this is a pretty cool thing here.

451
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:22,442
Scott: the they had a it was called the Hayabusa Spacecraft.

452
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:36,968
Scott: right and it went like a bajillion miles out into space to like a comet and It got a sample and then it came back to earth, which is pretty ridiculous Billion miles.

453
00:28:36,988 --> 00:28:39,780
Scott: Oh, it went to an asteroid named Itokawa.

454
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:46,065
Scott: So this thing the Japanese set a rocket anyone and it went out into space 1.25 billion miles.

455
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:52,120
Scott: Right, I guess that's you know, the total distance round trip.

456
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,480
Scott: So it must have been point seven five billion miles away was out for a little over seven years.

457
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,420
Scott: Yeah, seven years of going through space crazy fast.

458
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:02,933
Scott: it got this asteroid and it you know nibbled off a piece.

459
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:08,329
Scott: it came back to earth and You know, basically it came back into the earth.

460
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,580
Scott: It was coming and then of course, you know, there's the re-entry situation.

461
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,100
Scott: So it had basically it had the sample capsule with the sample in it and that piece has to land safely.

462
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:22,803
Scott: But all the other parts we have to like throw them off and get them disintegrated in the air so that you know The sample is safe.

463
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,257
Rym: It had actually a lander that was gonna do something to it.

464
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:27,040
Rym: Apparently that missed.

465
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,951
Scott: Anyway, well, you know take what you can get right?

466
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:33,520
Scott: Yeah, and it's better than exploding on the launchpad or anything.

467
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:37,820
Scott: So here's a video of the re-entry and usually space videos.

468
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:44,410
Scott: Like, you know the fact of what you're seeing is usually really cool But the visual of what you're seeing is usually not so cool.

469
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:46,700
Scott: Usually the video will be like a dot that moves.

470
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:49,639
Rym: Yeah, right or you're watching something actually taking off.

471
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:52,715
Scott: Yeah, I mean rockets are always cool because this big fire coming out.

472
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:58,297
Scott: but like, you know You watch like a star and it's like a star gets bright and then it disappears or something like that.

473
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:03,093
Scott: or like you see a Dot moving across the sky and there's not usually a lot of visual excitement.

474
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:09,519
Scott: or maybe they'll have to like apply false Digital coloring to something to make it exciting because it's a bunch of x-rays or some shit like that.

475
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:21,440
Scott: this is actually just straight-up video and it's actually crazy cool the way the The re-entry stuff that's you know, the parts that are not the capsule are disintegrating in the air.

476
00:30:21,964 --> 00:30:25,284
Scott: It looks like some crazy awesome fireworks Yep, and of course the capsule.

477
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:28,816
Rym: according to the news here quote the capsule was successfully retrieved at 708 UTC yesterday.

478
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:34,375
Scott: Yeah, it was in the Australian outback and I guess the Australians let the Japanese take it.

479
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:34,977
Scott: They didn't like.

480
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:35,720
Scott: we have.

481
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:38,754
Rym: You can have it back now.

482
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:46,813
Scott: We will learn the secret of get a raise in the secret of whatever that asteroid is made of which is probably I'm willing to bet rocks.

483
00:30:47,255 --> 00:30:48,000
Scott: What do you bet?

484
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,330
Scott: Ice you bet anything is made of ice and rock.

485
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:54,880
Scott: ice, you know, and ice is just a rock, right?

486
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:56,499
Scott: You know, it's just a water rock.

487
00:30:57,242 --> 00:30:58,405
Rym: Not really how not?

488
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:00,250
Rym: it's a crystal not a rock.

489
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,558
Scott: They're very different rocks are I mean, so a geode is not a rock You dude.

490
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:08,465
Rym: No, it's commerce.

491
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:09,652
Rym: they're made of ice.

492
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:10,718
Scott: course is not a rock.

493
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:18,420
Rym: Honestly one thing this brings up I just want to mention it, you know There's all this talk about the space program and what we should do.

494
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,887
Rym: should we go to Mars the moon and a lot of people are complaining that we're kind of backing off of manned space exploration lately.

495
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:31,385
Rym: and as a nerd and a geek unlike many other nerds and geeks I Pretty much say straight up.

496
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:39,620
Scott: There's no point in manned space exploration at least for the next 20 or 30 years Unless we develop something such as hibernation or something, you know to make it more practical.

497
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:46,360
Scott: Because really as soon as you add one person to a spacecraft Right, just the math of it really ruins everything.

498
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:55,080
Scott: It's like well now we need to bring a life support system and a bag of ice and all this other and I gotta buy Four DS's and then I gotta get four friends to play the DS's with me, right?

499
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:01,020
Scott: As soon as you add even one person you add all this stuff to the rocket, right and it makes everything incredibly less efficient.

500
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,775
Scott: Whereas, you know, what's the person doing up in space?

501
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:04,760
Scott: some experiments?

502
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:11,140
Scott: We can just automate the experiment and it'll be so much cheaper just to go put a rocket up there.

503
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:13,108
Scott: It does the experiment it comes back done.

504
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:18,514
Rym: Well, plus look at the civilization for example, you know You can start researching like iron working like right.

505
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:21,833
Rym: when you get it right away It's gonna take you like 20 years.

506
00:32:22,436 --> 00:32:32,980
Rym: in the meantime someone with some other civilization just busts out with all these little improvements and suddenly they've got X-men and all this other stuff and you're still working on the stupid iron working to build one.

507
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:36,340
Scott: Me and Scott Jones are actually playing sit for co-op yesterday, right?

508
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:41,620
Scott: And apparently the way that works is let's say I'm working on alphabet and you're working on horseback riding.

509
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:43,079
Scott: I'm just picking two things, right?

510
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:53,520
Scott: well I develop it in my in the amount of time it takes and you develop yours in the amount of time it takes and Then you know when I'm done you get what I got and when you're done I get what you got.

511
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,415
Scott: We share all our technology automatically because it's co-op, right?

512
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:57,279
Scott: So it's pretty cool.

513
00:32:57,984 --> 00:33:10,573
Scott: The thing is we're much better off both Researching the same thing at the same time, which means that it takes half the time as it would usually take because we're both Contributing our beakers simultaneously.

514
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:10,794
Scott: Now.

515
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:11,940
Scott: Why is that better, right?

516
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,480
Scott: You think well you can get two technologies in the same amount of time that you could have gotten, right?

517
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:19,340
Scott: You're getting the same amount of technologies per unit time, right?

518
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:23,480
Scott: It takes you twice as long but you get two or it takes you half as long and you get one.

519
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:38,711
Scott: The thing is if you do the if you both research at the same time Then you get one in half the time and then you can use that one during the second half of the time Whereas if you get two in the longer unit of time, you can't.

520
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:41,800
Scott: you basically are stuck at your current state the entire duration.

521
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,273
Scott: So you're basically putting off the bonuses and it's not.

522
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:46,940
Rym: so yeah take the analogy real life.

523
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,857
Rym: That's my feelings on the space program at least for now.

524
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:51,850
Rym: So really quick met a moment.

525
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:54,259
Rym: I'm in a moment the book book club.

526
00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:00,299
Rym: We're actually gonna do it on Thursday Thursday unless one of us dies or something get just buy a truck.

527
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:00,680
Rym: I don't know.

528
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,004
Scott: Yeah, mr.

529
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:05,758
Scott: Rym who had who bailed on when we were gonna do it last Thursday.

530
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:06,340
Rym: I was sick.

531
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:07,223
Scott: No, you weren't.

532
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:08,469
Scott: you went did some work shit.

533
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:10,496
Rym: No, I skipped something else for work shit.

534
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:14,527
Rym: I think Thursday night, we also skipped a Wednesday.

535
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:14,889
Rym: Remember?

536
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:15,934
Scott: I don't remember.

537
00:34:15,994 --> 00:34:16,355
Scott: Yeah.

538
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:17,520
Scott: No, we didn't skip a Wednesday.

539
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,304
Scott: We did the pokemons show on Wednesday.

540
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:21,989
Rym: Yeah, but we the previous Wednesday we were supposed to do it and we skipped it.

541
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:23,956
Scott: I don't know.

542
00:34:24,098 --> 00:34:26,270
Scott: the previous Thursday we and you skipped it for work.

543
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,010
Rym: I skipped a Wednesday and a Thursday one because I was sick and one because of work that I remember skipping away.

544
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,498
Rym: Anyway, the work thing was getting drunk and having an awesome time.

545
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,088
Scott: But yeah, you're supposed to be doing podcast.

546
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:39,489
Scott: Yeah Anyway, any other meta thing?

547
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,012
Scott: We're gonna.

548
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:42,356
Scott: net icon is in a book.

549
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:42,858
Rym: Yep.

550
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:46,429
Rym: Yeah ConnectiCon July 9th, 10th 11th gonna be super awesome.

551
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,163
Scott: anything else.

552
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:51,782
Rym: Pack stuff will say very soon.

553
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:53,708
Rym: We'll probably be able to announce our packs.

554
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:54,070
Rym: panels.

555
00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:57,219
Scott: Okay, nerd NYC recess.

556
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,583
Rym: Yes, you should go to that.

557
00:34:58,644 --> 00:35:00,750
Rym: It is basically a one-day gaming con.

558
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:03,656
Scott: It's on June 19th in Manhattan.

559
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:06,362
Rym: Go to nerd NYC comm which is this weekend.

560
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:07,745
Rym: Oh, fuck me.

561
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:10,292
Scott: I Needed this.

562
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:15,770
Scott: I needed this weekend to like hey do that panel and also prepare some burning wheels.

563
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,217
Rym: Alright, you know what though?

564
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:17,960
Rym: It's only one day.

565
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,030
Scott: it is I'll have to do all that on Sunday.

566
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:21,014
Scott: I'm also.

567
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:29,770
Scott: I'm also going to dentist on Friday so I could do it the second rest of the day on Friday I'm gonna spend the dentist the doctor you like going on the the Scott machine is wearing down.

568
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,070
Scott: Well, I actually you know, I haven't been in the dentist in too long.

569
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:40,197
Scott: I kept like, you know how many years like I've had a to-do list and I've keep putting items on and clearing them For the past four months.

570
00:35:40,979 --> 00:35:43,950
Rym: my phone every day has a reminder in the notification bar.

571
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:48,025
Rym: If I click on that it says dentist and you're right.

572
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,390
Scott: So today I actually did it.

573
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,016
Scott: I went to the insurance company's website.

574
00:35:51,077 --> 00:35:52,281
Scott: I click find doctor.

575
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:53,466
Scott: I called him up.

576
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:54,550
Scott: I click find dentist.

577
00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:02,733
Scott: I called him up and apparently the dentist I'm going to was my mom's dentist when she lived in Queens and she was Very.

578
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:09,190
Scott: we're gonna find out like this old Dennis, dude He's probably gonna be all cool with me because like he's a friend of the family in the olden days.

579
00:36:10,192 --> 00:36:10,573
Scott: Be cool.

580
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:11,136
Rym: All right.

581
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:11,699
Scott: All right.

582
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:14,010
Rym: Yeah, I don't think we have anything else on that front.

583
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:16,469
Rym: Still working on video got a lot of stuff in the hopper.

584
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,230
Rym: We're playing a lot of games with you guys lately like in the forum.

585
00:36:20,351 --> 00:36:30,921
Rym: So if you're looking for games to play like on weekends and weeknights just keep poking in the forum or make sure you join the FRC or they're the GeekNights steam groups because There's been a lot going on a lot of good counter-strike.

586
00:36:31,343 --> 00:36:32,890
Scott: Yeah, I haven't really been playing too much cat.

587
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,750
Scott: I play counters like once but I've planted some more since I've actually been playing sieve for and sucking ass.

588
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,849
Scott: but I've actually you know put a little bit of effort into learning to suck less ass.

589
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:47,910
Scott: and Mostly it's just because I want to play Civ 5 and I'm pretty sure like Civ 4 is definitely flawed for me.

590
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,557
Rym: But the skills will transfer.

591
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:50,400
Scott: Oh, yes.

592
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,690
Scott: I hope that these the lessons I learn will transfer At least if not the military stuff things like have an economy.

593
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:13,430
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I pretty much figured out like, you know what a lot of this problem is is that you know, there's just so Many things that have you know effects and you can't really then they're not all out in front of you simultaneously So it's hard to keep track of all of them.

594
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:21,490
Scott: You know like this gives me plus on that and this gives me percentage Minus on that and this then how you can't keep them all in your brain at once.

595
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:33,307
Scott: So you really just need to like, you know Look at what your problem area is and then be able to find something to fix that problem And then that causes another problem then, you know fix that one and balance them all out.

596
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:37,544
Scott: that way If you try to actually keep the whole game in your brain at once, you're just gonna fail.

597
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:38,870
Scott: I don't think it's possible.

598
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,637
Rym: Uh, I don't know I play.

599
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:43,945
Scott: you're gonna keep the effects of every single technology.

600
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,270
Scott: you have every single improvement.

601
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:54,070
Scott: You have every single position of every single population point, you know working on a spot that you know Every single military unit you've got in their health.

602
00:37:54,170 --> 00:38:03,990
Rym: The only thing I don't keep immediate track of in all my cities is where stuff's allocated in terms Like what resources is working, you know, and then you could like you could turn a guy into a scientist.

603
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:10,830
Scott: You can do so many possible things to keep track of your tax levels your your civics your religions.

604
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:11,254
Scott: You're.

605
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:12,970
Rym: yeah, I keep track of all that.

606
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:25,867
Rym: Like I said, the only thing I don't keep track of is if I have a stack of units I consider it an army and I don't worry about the individuals within it and I don't keep track of what is working what around a city.

607
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:26,650
Rym: instead?

608
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:34,215
Rym: I'll use the buttons that say things like optimize for population growth or optimize for shields Yeah, and everything where those.

609
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:35,178
Scott: where are those buttons?

610
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,890
Scott: you open up the big city screen right right and down bottom, right?

611
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,919
Scott: This is little tiny buttons in a cluster.

612
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:41,904
Scott: There's a whole bunch of.

613
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:43,090
Scott: it's a lot of.

614
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:50,910
Scott: There's a lot of shit going on a whole lot anyway, so today we're gonna talk about bidding game.

615
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,043
Rym: Yes, they games that have bidding mechanics, you know, we're talking about nerd NYC and the recess is awesome.

616
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:03,941
Rym: But as are the monthly gaming nights that we're at pretty much every one of them They're on Fridays at this awesome like think wine bar coffee house.

617
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,590
Scott: Yeah, it's think coffee, but it has non coffee.

618
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:14,825
Scott: It's basically a bidding game is a game that involves bidding, you know Like you auction stuff off and there are plenty of games that have bidding mechanics.

619
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:28,629
Scott: even monopoly has auctions technically then even though no one uses them and we've talked about games on the show before like power grid and Almond Ray that have bidding parts, you know, like in power grid you bid for the power plants and then you play power grid You know, but you don't bid for anything else.

620
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:34,930
Scott: But there are games out there right that are pretty much just bidding or almost all bidding and that's it.

621
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:36,181
Scott: All you do is bid on things.

622
00:39:36,222 --> 00:39:38,354
Scott: That's the whole game Especially like the.

623
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:42,947
Scott: there's the famous Rainer kinesia auction trilogy of modern art Medici and raw.

624
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:46,882
Scott: we've talked about raw Which is mostly kind of bidding sorta.

625
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,469
Scott: It's the bidding slot machine.

626
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:55,666
Rym: Yep Well, it's weird because this this night, you know playing these weird bidding games Which we played kind of randomly because we need stuff to do after we played a whole bunch of Dominion.

627
00:39:55,686 --> 00:40:05,895
Scott: Mm-hmm There should be some bidding cards in Dominion like a bidding thing like oh man suddenly there's no the province bid Some sort of thing.

628
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:09,669
Rym: or you know, you play this card now, there's an auction for a province, but you might not get it.

629
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:14,907
Scott: Yeah, everyone uses the money, you know, whoever has the most money in their hand right now gets province.

630
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:16,455
Rym: Mm-hmm I don't know about that.

631
00:40:16,495 --> 00:40:21,425
Rym: Maybe we just add money Real money.

632
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:28,897
Scott: Yeah Whoever gives the all you have to whoever, you know, everyone bid real money The amount you bid.

633
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:31,330
Scott: you must give that amount to each every other player.

634
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,342
Scott: So if I bid a dollar I have to give one dollar to each other player.

635
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:36,210
Scott: whoever bids the most gets a province.

636
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:48,413
Rym: But it was weird because we played these like fun bidding games because they were quick But as a result of playing them I remembered old games that we completely forgot about like Pizarro and Wherever.

637
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:51,006
Rym: I haven't forgotten a bidding game, but we played it at the same time.

638
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:51,730
Rym: We played Pizarro.

639
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,401
Scott: Yeah, web of power is not a bidding game.

640
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,045
Scott: It's a good game.

641
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:54,810
Scott: I don't remember.

642
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:55,595
Rym: I liked it.

643
00:40:55,635 --> 00:40:57,305
Rym: you hated it, but you were undefeated at it.

644
00:40:57,446 --> 00:40:57,949
Scott: Yeah the.

645
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:01,590
Scott: So let's just talk about the games we played to get that of the way.

646
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:11,630
Scott: So the one we played is for sale, which is a really, you know, it was simple and kind of fun But I don't know how long it would last in terms of replay value.

647
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:19,530
Rym: however I think I'm gonna buy it because it's a great game to whip out With some noobs or to whip out like where you're waiting in line somewhere cuz you can play it quick.

648
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,190
Rym: It doesn't have a lot of pieces or whip out like at a convention if you're teaching people stuff.

649
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:27,989
Scott: So basically the way for sale works is pretty much just bidding but it's two stages, right?

650
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:33,173
Scott: So everyone starts with some money and you use the money to buy property and the.

651
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:41,490
Scott: all the properties are auctioned off and then you use the properties to bid for Checks for money.

652
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:53,250
Scott: So you basically buy properties with your starting money and then you sell the properties for other money And then you add your leftover starting money that you didn't use to buy properties to your ending money and you win.

653
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,590
Scott: So it's like you auction and then you auction what you auctioned and you know.

654
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,847
Scott: What you bought in the first auction becomes your.

655
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:02,170
Scott: you know What you use to buy stuff in the second option.

656
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:08,250
Rym: You can't just make a straight direct bidding game because bizarro as I recall was pretty much that you just you all bid.

657
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,455
Rym: Then you all bid again.

658
00:42:09,475 --> 00:42:10,781
Rym: They carry victory points.

659
00:42:11,244 --> 00:42:12,650
Scott: Yeah, so, how do you win bizarro?

660
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,202
Scott: You just bid on the best possible thing basically every time.

661
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:19,430
Rym: cuz I was undefeated at that game I just bought Magellan every time and he got me so many points.

662
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:21,822
Rym: I always won and no one really beat me in the bidding.

663
00:42:21,903 --> 00:42:22,606
Rym: It was stupid.

664
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:30,649
Scott: Yeah Well, I guess it's because you know, if anyone bid more than that, right then they would have had Magellan sure But they also would have lost because they bid too much.

665
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:33,846
Rym: I think it was more than a lot of the people we were playing with were not that great.

666
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:37,450
Rym: at board games I noticed that we tended to dominate back then.

667
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,990
Rym: We don't dominate as much among ourselves in the crew as we did against those people.

668
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,356
Scott: No, not at all, but I did.

669
00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:45,590
Scott: I believe I won a Dominion pretty bad pretty strongly.

670
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:47,758
Rym: Yeah, I won the first round of this game.

671
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,264
Rym: But here's the trick for sales.

672
00:42:49,304 --> 00:42:49,726
Rym: really fun.

673
00:42:49,746 --> 00:42:50,509
Rym: Like I'd recommend it.

674
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:50,850
Rym: It's cheap.

675
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:52,476
Rym: I'm sure it's got to be cheap.

676
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:54,163
Rym: I wouldn't buy it if it wasn't cheap.

677
00:42:54,263 --> 00:42:55,950
Scott: Yeah, I would pay 20 bucks.

678
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:56,813
Scott: Yeah most.

679
00:42:56,914 --> 00:43:03,269
Rym: but the cool thing about it is that it's not like it's a bidding game technically But really it's a game of chicken.

680
00:43:03,906 --> 00:43:11,601
Rym: Yeah Because the way this is the cool mechanic is that the second half is just a blind Simultaneous bid with the stuff that you bid on at the first half.

681
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:13,066
Rym: Mm-hmm, but the first half.

682
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:14,470
Rym: so I start the bidding.

683
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:18,450
Rym: So there's you know a property out there to my or a check, you know a property.

684
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:22,189
Rym: I might have some value between you know, one and thirty I think.

685
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,197
Rym: So I have you know, say fifteen money.

686
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,525
Rym: I can bid one or two or three or whatever.

687
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:32,741
Rym: The next person has to either Beat the bid that I put out or pass.

688
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:40,190
Scott: now if you pass you're out of the bidding Completely and you take those you take the shittiest property that is still available.

689
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,795
Rym: So you take the crappiest property.

690
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:46,870
Rym: if you had already bid something you pay half of what you would bid and keep right.

691
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:49,727
Scott: So for example, let's pretend it's two-player right.

692
00:43:49,868 --> 00:43:53,197
Scott: pretend It's three-player a B Scott Rym and Emily right.

693
00:43:53,538 --> 00:43:54,721
Scott: and there's three properties.

694
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:57,027
Scott: Their value is one five and ten.

695
00:43:57,047 --> 00:44:02,256
Scott: I bid 1,000. Rym Rym bids 2,000.

696
00:44:02,256 --> 00:44:05,209
Scott: Emily says she's out so she gets the number one for free.

697
00:44:06,053 --> 00:44:07,981
Scott: Rym bid - I'm gonna up bid Rym.

698
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:10,933
Scott: I'm gonna go for three or I did five Thousand.

699
00:44:10,973 --> 00:44:11,816
Scott: he bids five.

700
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:12,418
Scott: I'm out.

701
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,410
Rym: All right, I pay two thousand and I take the second low.

702
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,536
Scott: No, no, I'm out.

703
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:17,824
Scott: So I okay.

704
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:18,930
Scott: Yes, I'm out.

705
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,836
Scott: So I pay half of what I bid.

706
00:44:20,856 --> 00:44:21,518
Scott: so I bid three.

707
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:32,770
Scott: remember so half of three rounded down is what one Right, so I pay one and I take the second lowest But then I am forced to take the highest one and pay my full bid.

708
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:34,181
Scott: Yeah, so he pays five.

709
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:34,987
Scott: so I got.

710
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:36,355
Scott: you know He pays everything.

711
00:44:36,616 --> 00:44:42,710
Scott: the winner has to pay every single thing that they've bid But the losers only have to pay half of what they have bid.

712
00:44:43,132 --> 00:44:53,309
Scott: So you're actually the way to win is to basically get really good Properties by only paying half and forcing someone else to pay the full amount for whatever.

713
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:58,049
Scott: that way They don't have enough money to buy more good stuff and that's pretty much what it comes down to.

714
00:44:58,511 --> 00:44:59,694
Rym: so it's really chicken.

715
00:44:59,734 --> 00:45:00,637
Rym: more so than bidding.

716
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:12,699
Rym: the second half is really bidding, but if you play games like Euchre or Bridge or anything like that if you can count cards and keep track of like who bid on what how much money they have Then you can basically play the game.

717
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:15,370
Scott: perfect and how much money people have is just open, you know.

718
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:18,441
Scott: And now you can memorize what properties everyone got.

719
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:20,568
Scott: so and that's for sale.

720
00:45:20,588 --> 00:45:24,547
Scott: It's pretty much It's just two rounds of bidding one and then two and then that's it.

721
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:34,217
Rym: It's a fun game You know, we whipped it out We played it a couple times and then after we played Dominion we were looking for something to do and we decided with the same guy to play Claws tubers hoity-toity.

722
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:36,707
Scott: now hoity-toity was like a game I had heard of.

723
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:37,550
Scott: it's pretty famous.

724
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,092
Scott: All right, don't?

725
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:43,410
Rym: often we got to talk more about the people like the design when this field is jar in 1990.

726
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:47,170
Rym: Yeah, because we do that with the anime and we don't do it as much with the board games.

727
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,795
Rym: I think it's just as important claws.

728
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:50,420
Rym: tuber also made settlers of Catan.

729
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,684
Scott: I think it's Klaus toy burr.

730
00:45:52,005 --> 00:45:52,788
Rym: I'm saying tuber.

731
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:57,300
Scott: Okay Yeah, he knows he made hoity-toity before he made settlers.

732
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:57,742
Scott: It's one.

733
00:45:57,762 --> 00:45:58,685
Scott: this field is yar.

734
00:45:58,745 --> 00:46:00,029
Scott: It was a very popular game.

735
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:07,970
Rym: Hoity-toity is a game where the rich people decide what to do with that money and show off the things to other rich people.

736
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,415
Scott: Yeah, it's basically a racing game.

737
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:16,178
Scott: You're trying to race around this track to get to the victory area where you win and You you're basically.

738
00:46:16,218 --> 00:46:28,678
Scott: you're buying these different, uh, you know Antiques and then you buy antiques and then you exhibit them in castles and then you basically move forward by exhibiting Your collections of antiques.

739
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,650
Scott: and but you have to buy them and you have to steal them from other people.

740
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:35,428
Scott: You have to steal people's money and there's a whole thing going.

741
00:46:35,468 --> 00:46:35,770
Rym: it's tough.

742
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:39,284
Rym: You basically play paper rock scissors and then you play paper rock scissors again.

743
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:43,396
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of a Bracket of rock paper scissors, right?

744
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:47,350
Scott: So basically every turn there's a there's a round of rock paper scissors.

745
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,634
Scott: But it's not rock paper scissors.

746
00:46:48,694 --> 00:46:51,162
Scott: It's a sort of rock paper auction house or castle.

747
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:53,570
Scott: So everyone picks auction house or castle.

748
00:46:53,731 --> 00:47:00,387
Scott: okay, then the people who did auction house they either pick bid money or thief.

749
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:08,330
Scott: and Then so all those people do that and then all the people pick castle pick either Exhibit thief detective exhibit thief detectives.

750
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:11,869
Scott: There's a rock paper scissors going on over there and then you just keep doing this.

751
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:17,209
Scott: You know tree of rock paper scissors is over and over again until someone wins.

752
00:47:18,113 --> 00:47:20,784
Rym: Now, I don't think it's worth explaining the details of it.

753
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:22,189
Rym: I mean now it's a fun game.

754
00:47:23,213 --> 00:47:27,870
Rym: I would actually say it's another game that if you're like really into board games, you'd probably want to keep it around.

755
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:34,240
Rym: It's a good game to play with like newbies or play at once teach people about bidding and stuff But doesn't have a lot of staying power.

756
00:47:34,662 --> 00:47:36,630
Scott: Yeah, I don't think it has much staying power at all.

757
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:42,770
Scott: The big problem I had with the game is that having a big momentum in the game is really powerful.

758
00:47:42,991 --> 00:47:47,569
Scott: You know if you get a whole bunch of the antiques then pretty much no one can stop you.

759
00:47:48,273 --> 00:47:54,707
Rym: Well at the same time if you have all the antiques the only and you're already ahead The only way to win is to exhibit.

760
00:47:54,727 --> 00:47:55,090
Rym: at the end.

761
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,960
Rym: You have to exhibit someone.

762
00:47:57,282 --> 00:47:58,308
Rym: everyone's basically gonna thief.

763
00:47:58,348 --> 00:48:06,741
Rym: you Steal all your stuff and now you don't have a big hand to win the end game at the end and then It's not a completely simple game.

764
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:08,650
Rym: It's still solvable, but it's not like dead.

765
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:16,715
Scott: So yeah the other big problem is is that okay you have a basically this branch of two and then one branch goes to two more and The other branch goes to three.

766
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:24,744
Scott: but a lot of times you look at someone's situation where they are on the board Right what they have in their hand and most of those choices are ruled out.

767
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:29,170
Scott: if you have a whole bunch of antiques There's pretty much no reason to go to the auction house.

768
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:30,375
Scott: You're gonna go to the castle.

769
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:36,525
Scott: and if you go to the castle and you're in the way behind You're best off being the detective or the thief.

770
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:41,450
Scott: and if you're way ahead There's almost no reason to be the detective, but there's also no reason to be the theme.

771
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,140
Rym: There's no reason to be the exhibitor.

772
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,722
Rym: That's where.

773
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:46,509
Rym: that's where the game is.

774
00:48:46,529 --> 00:48:49,664
Scott: yeah So it's pretty obvious what someone's gonna do.

775
00:48:49,784 --> 00:48:50,548
Scott: because okay?

776
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,540
Scott: You can do that and you're gonna get screwed.

777
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:56,149
Scott: you can do that, but it's gonna be useless to you.

778
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:57,094
Scott: You're only gonna.

779
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,481
Scott: You know you're the you're in first place.

780
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:13,899
Rym: you pick the detective congratulations You move one forward one space big deal Which means really the only way to win is to play smartly to a degree, but every time decisions are remotely arbitrary or Anytime other players might try to second-guess you.

781
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,131
Rym: you just need to openly and randomly decide what you're gonna Do.

782
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:19,298
Scott: I think playing randomly is a choice.

783
00:49:19,338 --> 00:49:24,396
Scott: the problem is if you play randomly you're gonna end up picking Combinations that do nothing for you.

784
00:49:24,697 --> 00:49:25,459
Scott: You're like you'll pick.

785
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,104
Rym: if you just don't play you don't you?

786
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:29,793
Rym: basically you do randomly in terms Of all right.

787
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:33,487
Rym: am I going to exhibit or thief like you narrow it down to like the two options?

788
00:49:33,527 --> 00:49:36,698
Rym: that would both be Reasonable decisions, and then you go randomly.

789
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:39,950
Rym: yeah, but then the game is as the same problem.

790
00:49:41,571 --> 00:49:44,384
Rym: It's just who put the poison in the cup and there's no way to answer that question.

791
00:49:44,404 --> 00:49:57,710
Scott: my biggest problem in the game was I Started off pretty strong But then I had like you know four useless turns in a row because I tried to do the only useful thing I could do And I didn't win when I went to bid in the auction house.

792
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:03,548
Scott: And then so I exhibited which is the right and then I couldn't possibly win at exhibiting because I had less.

793
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:06,663
Scott: you know I had less proper antiques than everyone else.

794
00:50:07,106 --> 00:50:13,005
Scott: so I Uselessly exhibited and I was thiefed even though my exhibiting was useless and that I didn't have enough.

795
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:15,253
Scott: so exhibiting was not even an option anymore.

796
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:20,389
Scott: and because exhibiting wasn't an option I Couldn't get any more properties.

797
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:28,476
Rym: One thing I do like those that this game has a lot of mechanics where you know there's a game or someone I was like well What do you do if you run out of cards?

798
00:50:28,516 --> 00:50:30,303
Rym: then the answer is always like oh you reshuffle.

799
00:50:30,664 --> 00:50:34,197
Rym: the answer to every question like That in hoity-toity is fuck you.

800
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:34,880
Scott: Yep.

801
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:35,382
Rym: It's like.

802
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:36,305
Rym: What do you do if you don't?

803
00:50:36,345 --> 00:50:37,530
Rym: if no one has any more money?

804
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,222
Rym: You're fucked no one has any more money, and that's the end of it.

805
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:48,229
Scott: play the rest of the game jerks Yeah, and the other thing is that like if you do a thief and they get detective you still get to steal something But the thief goes away temporarily.

806
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:53,085
Scott: So my thieves I died because thieving was the best option I had.

807
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:59,303
Scott: I did it and I did it again and I successfully thieved twice and then I didn't have any thieves.

808
00:50:59,343 --> 00:51:05,162
Scott: so a whole option was removed from me and But that was still the best option for me to do.

809
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:08,479
Scott: because I didn't have that many properties I was doing really well like that when we played.

810
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:10,267
Rym: I had a runaway game for the beginning.

811
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:10,770
Scott: me, too.

812
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:11,509
Scott: I was running away.

813
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:15,131
Scott: I was in first place like the whole beginning and then before I had the four useless turn And then

814
00:51:15,232 --> 00:51:24,987
Rym: I was in first place all after that until the fateful moment where I had to choose randomly because I do arbitrary options And everyone else chose the thief and stole my entire collection, and then I had no recourse.

815
00:51:25,007 --> 00:51:28,426
Rym: the rest of the game Yeah, I just detective ever round because there's nothing else I could do.

816
00:51:28,768 --> 00:51:32,745
Scott: yeah I think part of I think a good strategy might just be to hang back.

817
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:39,049
Scott: just play casually Don't try to do anything strong, and then just come on strong in the end with exhibiting and such.

818
00:51:39,732 --> 00:51:42,666
Scott: Don't go forward early because you're just gonna ruin the rest of you if you.

819
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:50,083
Scott: if you fail early You just know way to come back, but if you fail at the end You'll still be ahead, and you can get somewhere, but in general.

820
00:51:50,183 --> 00:51:52,814
Rym: I like bidding as a mechanic in games I always have.

821
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:56,030
Rym: I love like dunes bidding for combat the blind bid with the troops.

822
00:51:56,131 --> 00:51:56,857
Rym: I love that shit.

823
00:51:56,977 --> 00:52:01,030
Rym: hmm or like I'm on ray You know it is a game, and there's all this other stuff.

824
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:04,453
Rym: But if you're smart and you understand I'm on ray And you I'm.

825
00:52:04,473 --> 00:52:05,438
Rym: you've like you played the.

826
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,326
Scott: so how much do you give to the gods?

827
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:08,290
Rym: it pretty much?

828
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,860
Rym: Just is really a bidding game.

829
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,587
Scott: sacrifice to your god.

830
00:52:12,808 --> 00:52:13,813
Rym: Oh my god I want to play some.

831
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:15,904
Rym: I'm on ray something fierce good game.

832
00:52:15,964 --> 00:52:17,009
Rym: love that game a good game.

833
00:52:17,586 --> 00:52:23,698
Scott: Yeah I think the thing with bidding games is that makes them so fun is That it's not in a lot of games.

834
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:25,987
Scott: even look at something as great as Puerto Rico right.

835
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:26,570
Scott: It's your turn.

836
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,509
Scott: Let's say you're playing freaking you know.

837
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:35,748
Scott: For five player Puerto Rico you've got all all possible choices of jobs out there.

838
00:52:35,828 --> 00:52:37,736
Scott: on the right You've got.

839
00:52:37,817 --> 00:52:39,270
Scott: it's like an eight-way choice.

840
00:52:39,311 --> 00:52:39,947
Scott: That's pretty good.

841
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:45,345
Scott: But in a bidding game you've actually usually got like this whole range of choices right.

842
00:52:45,385 --> 00:52:49,359
Scott: like I could bid one Two three four dollars.

843
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,644
Scott: now sometimes some games.

844
00:52:50,665 --> 00:52:51,970
Scott: that stupid it is.

845
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,836
Scott: But you it's about the.

846
00:52:53,896 --> 00:52:55,381
Rym: I guess it adds a lot of psychology.

847
00:52:55,422 --> 00:53:03,346
Rym: like you have all these options and everyone else has these options And everyone's kind of playing simultaneously with this very like direct competition.

848
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:04,590
Rym: like where was the guy with Maaz?

849
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:05,879
Rym: Who you'd always mess with?

850
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:23,098
Rym: I'll be the guy in a bidding game I'll bid two three Thanks Hey nine fine just take it.

851
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:28,268
Rym: fuck all right I Love that sort of stuff.

852
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:35,213
Scott: Yeah, you know and it actually you know it makes something that's pretty hard to think about right you have to actually Do.

853
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:43,150
Scott: it's not just a choice between like well a and B It's actually a difficult decision like how many dollars is that worth to me?

854
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,816
Scott: You know these dollars.

855
00:53:44,956 --> 00:53:51,460
Scott: I could get X victory points with them if I use this home But I could get X victory points if I use it.

856
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,330
Rym: how many dollar victory points is it worth to my opponent?

857
00:53:54,830 --> 00:54:01,310
Rym: I might want to bid very high and harm myself to prevent the second-place player from getting something that could make them win the game.

858
00:54:01,611 --> 00:54:13,550
Rym: Yep, there's so much calculus going on that I guess I feel like the games that I've liked the most are the ones that have Very intense maths that I have to just like crunch through in real time.

859
00:54:13,671 --> 00:54:25,812
Rym: Not like games where I can plan my whole turn and then like I know what to do But like in a bidding game where I have to plan everything in real time like while the bidding is going on Like Scott throws me for a loop, and he bids 10 on something I didn't expect.

860
00:54:26,294 --> 00:54:31,370
Rym: I've got to like shift my entire calculus now and make a new determination like right then and there it like.

861
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:38,545
Rym: It feels like a worthwhile use of the brain Like you feel the gears churning, and I don't get that with a lot of games.

862
00:54:38,586 --> 00:54:38,927
Rym: I play.

863
00:54:38,947 --> 00:54:41,136
Scott: yeah I mean you look at power grid right.

864
00:54:41,156 --> 00:54:44,670
Scott: you can bid any number of your dollars on a new power plant.

865
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:49,510
Rym: I'll be like if you bid one too many dollars on a power plant that'll cost you the game.

866
00:54:50,313 --> 00:54:53,447
Scott: And it's like how do you figure out how many dollars it's worth right?

867
00:54:53,488 --> 00:54:58,748
Scott: It's like well Yes, okay, so that is the fusion power plant right there as a minimum bid of what 50 right?

868
00:54:59,752 --> 00:55:05,030
Scott: I think so if you can get it for 50 that's sort of duh right cuz then that's gonna win you the game.

869
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:09,950
Rym: But if you get 63 all right did that deny you building the last property that you'll be able to power to win the game?

870
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,015
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

871
00:55:11,035 --> 00:55:12,503
Scott: should I you know the guy bid 65 on it, okay?

872
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:16,512
Scott: Well obviously it's an awesome power plant I want.

873
00:55:16,532 --> 00:55:24,063
Scott: it would help me a bunch of put me to the front of the rock making me move last if I pay $67 for it or $70 for it.

874
00:55:24,143 --> 00:55:31,700
Scott: well those three dollars Make it you know be such a hurt to me that it's no longer worth it to have that awesome power plant You know.

875
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,535
Scott: and then maybe though I don't actually want the power plant.

876
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:36,261
Scott: so but I do want.

877
00:55:36,562 --> 00:55:40,355
Scott: I know that if he gets it for the current bid of 55 That's too good for him.

878
00:55:40,395 --> 00:55:42,043
Scott: He'll win, but then I need to make.

879
00:55:42,183 --> 00:55:43,630
Scott: I need to make him bid higher.

880
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:49,470
Scott: But if I bid 60 will he actually bid 61 or will he realize that me paying?

881
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,397
Scott: 60 will fuck me or mine.

882
00:55:51,477 --> 00:55:58,790
Rym: him paying 61 will fuck him and my bidding on a power plant I don't want because I want another power plant, but I didn't get to start the bidding.

883
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:02,346
Scott: But if I pass I'm out forever, and I won't be able to buy any power plants.

884
00:56:02,366 --> 00:56:08,388
Scott: Yeah You know there's a lot a lot of clever decisions to make when there is an auction situation.

885
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,857
Rym: It's also just the directness of it.

886
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:13,166
Rym: I love direct competition in games.

887
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:17,890
Rym: I mean I had this whole stint I think we both did where we really played a lot of indirect competition games.

888
00:56:18,492 --> 00:56:21,544
Rym: But I come back to really enjoying games or I can be like Scott.

889
00:56:21,865 --> 00:56:28,549
Scott: I'm destroying your troops I mean if you think about like an auction in real life right you go to you know.

890
00:56:33,153 --> 00:56:36,650
Scott: So you go to that kind of auction and the guys get a cow right and you're like I need a cow.

891
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:40,868
Scott: And you say well, it's really easy to figure out whether you should bid for the cow.

892
00:56:40,928 --> 00:56:42,133
Scott: right it's like I've X dollars.

893
00:56:42,535 --> 00:56:46,150
Scott: the cow will make me X dollars in milk and meat and whatever.

894
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:48,376
Scott: So I should pay.

895
00:56:48,396 --> 00:56:49,339
Scott: you know it'll.

896
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:54,173
Scott: you know I'll have this much cost in cow food and barn Whatever's.

897
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:56,764
Scott: so therefore that cow is this good a cow.

898
00:56:56,845 --> 00:56:58,050
Scott: It's worth X dollars to me.

899
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,423
Scott: So you bid that X dollars.

900
00:56:59,443 --> 00:57:00,110
Scott: you try?

901
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:05,230
Scott: You know you bid you know what you slowly bid up until you reach that limit of what you're willing to pay.

902
00:57:05,612 --> 00:57:08,748
Scott: And if it goes above that you stop and that you let someone else take the cow.

903
00:57:08,788 --> 00:57:16,035
Scott: and it's real It's real simple, but imagine it if you you add just a little bit of rules to that like okay Here's three cows.

904
00:57:16,356 --> 00:57:17,460
Scott: you can get one of them.

905
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:22,515
Scott: You can't have all three right and suddenly It's real tough right?

906
00:57:22,636 --> 00:57:24,944
Scott: it's not as simple calculation as you know.

907
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:25,967
Scott: how much money do I have?

908
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:26,790
Scott: how much is it worth?

909
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,450
Scott: Kind of thing it's oh shit, which one do I want?

910
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:34,710
Scott: I want I need to get the most cow for the least money, and I can all in disease restrictions.

911
00:57:35,471 --> 00:57:35,973
Scott: What do I do?

912
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:37,721
Rym: Oh no, but if I get the cow now?

913
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:39,569
Rym: I can't afford the cow bell yep.

914
00:57:40,692 --> 00:57:42,485
Rym: So I'll leave you all with some parting advice.

915
00:57:42,505 --> 00:57:43,210
Rym: This is going on long.

916
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:43,973
Rym: I guess we can end it.

917
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:54,444
Rym: if you're playing a bidding game with incremental bidding power grid is the best example and You and you're playing against people who don't listen to GeekNights And you want to get like win.

918
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:55,489
Rym: you want to win the game?

919
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:03,190
Rym: Your strategy is simple calculate if you can as early as possible before any bidding starts the absolute maximum.

920
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:06,389
Rym: You are going to pay for something and know that and keep it in your mind.

921
00:58:06,911 --> 00:58:08,576
Rym: But don't bid anything like that right away.

922
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:23,681
Rym: basically always immediately pull a Scott and increment the bid by one just like seven nine Eleven Thirteen, but just keep doing that and you'll exude this sense of like confidence And you'll probably intimidate people into backing off of the bidding.

923
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:32,130
Scott: or you'll intimidate them and to be like yeah They'll be like yeah I'll play your game And they'll bid way more and if they get above and they'll just hurt themselves by bidding too much.

924
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:35,687
Rym: You'd already planned like that was the most you were gonna play you just bail, and then they're fucked.

925
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:37,638
Rym: yep So that's it.

926
00:58:37,738 --> 00:58:44,044
Rym: if you are able to do that consistently Unless other people also do that you will win the majority of bidding games you play.

927
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:47,417
Scott: you've also got to take into account sometimes Special things like in for sale.

928
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:50,770
Scott: you have that dividing by half thing yeah, so always bid an odd number.

929
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:52,542
Scott: There's no reason to bid an even number ever.

930
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,072
Scott: yeah pretty much It's.

931
00:58:54,152 --> 00:58:56,264
Rym: it amazed me how many even numbers still got bid.

932
00:58:56,565 --> 00:58:57,430
Scott: I know people didn't fit.

933
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,058
Scott: I didn't figure it out until like the second game.

934
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:01,148
Rym: Yeah, well the first game you ran out of money.

935
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:07,710
Rym: the second game I ran out of money But I was assuming the noob was gonna fuck up, and then he didn't fuck up, and then I lost all my money.

936
00:59:09,852 --> 00:59:14,929
Scott: Anyway All right bidding games are cool Just like miles Davis.

937
00:59:21,305 --> 00:59:23,820
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
