Scott: You know how you know this happens to everyone in the world.

6
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:33,714
Scott: you get a song in your head But you don't know what the song You know.

7
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,823
Rym: it's even worse when you know what the song is no.

8
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:39,550
Scott: I don't even have the whole song in my head.

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,109
Scott: I've got like the tiniest piece of a single like bit from the song in my head.

10
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:49,530
Scott: Basically this is some song and I'm almost positive that it's gonna.

11
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:53,390
Scott: It's gonna end up being like some Britney Spears song or some bullshit like that, right?

12
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,203
Scott: But it's basically the only part of it that I can get in my eye.

13
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,792
Rym: This is gonna sing it well Kind of.

14
00:00:57,812 --> 00:00:58,194
Scott: it goes like.

15
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:03,615
Scott: it's like a weird techno violin noise, and it goes like Kind of.

16
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:04,641
Scott: that's it or it?

17
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:15,856
Scott: maybe it goes do I forget exactly how it goes, but it's like these four like new kind of noises all together Something along those lines.

18
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:18,184
Rym: yeah, this is that song.

19
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:19,609
Rym: no is it?

20
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:23,954
Scott: maybe I can't.

21
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:26,830
Scott: I won't know unless I actually have the real recording of it.

22
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,163
Rym: Why don't you use that the iPhone app for your home in?

23
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:30,250
Scott: because that?

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,253
Scott: What I hum.

25
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:33,544
Scott: that isn't enough and things I don't even know.

26
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:34,248
Scott: if like is it?

27
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:41,113
Scott: is it Going down going you know is it Scott?

28
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:42,141
Rym: are you sure it's a song?

29
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:43,430
Rym: are you sure it's not nothing?

30
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:50,181
Scott: I'm 100. if it's not a song then if I can get the rest of it out of my brain I could make like a number one dance hit cuz.

31
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:53,432
Scott: I'm pretty sure that's what it is Is it?

32
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,617
Rym: you're sure it's just a violin.

33
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:56,644
Rym: do you remember anything else from the song like it?

34
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:58,050
Rym: was it a bass line?

35
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,755
Scott: I kind of kind of associate it with the kind of song that you would hear while you're standing waiting for a concert to start Like kind of.

36
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:06,901
Scott: you know that kind of song.

37
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:08,045
Rym: What kind of song is that?

38
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:08,910
Rym: the last concert?

39
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,351
Rym: I went to.

40
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:10,195
Rym: that wasn't pecs.

41
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:13,830
Rym: I think it was phantomas doing the music or the concert started.

42
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:22,328
Scott: The kind that they play on the loudspeaker while you're standing waiting for something.

43
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,873
Scott: you know That kind.

44
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,198
Scott: the kind to get you grooves.

45
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,262
Rym: That's not a kind.

46
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:27,286
Scott: That's a kind.

47
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:27,868
Scott: No it isn't.

48
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:28,250
Scott: it is.

49
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:34,630
Rym: Most concerts don't have that and they have a cover band in the front or the opening ad.

50
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:37,158
Rym: Anyway, that X does that.

51
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,390
Scott: I'm sure somebody listening will help me out.

52
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,690
Rym: Oh, yes, they're gonna help you out with a song that kind of comes down four times.

53
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:44,494
Scott: I don't know.

54
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:45,237
Scott: it might go like.

55
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,013
Scott: I think it might go up down way up or down I don't know.

56
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:50,699
Rym: so here's what you've said.

57
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,877
Rym: it does something that might be up or down And maybe involves a violin.

58
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:57,181
Rym: well.

59
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:59,769
Scott: It's a techno ish violin ish noise.

60
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:10,998
Scott: I I like a digital violin At this point, and there's a piece of the song where it plays four notes And then the other song happens, and then it.

61
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:12,405
Scott: you know the thing happens if you wait.

62
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,490
Rym: so other stuff happens.

63
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:14,676
Scott: I don't know what the other stuff is.

64
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:15,541
Scott: I can't remember it at all.

65
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,190
Rym: so how is this playing in your head?

66
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,649
Rym: What does it sound like in your head?

67
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,905
Scott: I cannot reproduce it with my mouse because my mouth is not a digital violin, but any my head.

68
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:27,081
Rym: it plays back different ways So you don't even remember it.

69
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:28,490
Rym: you've got nothing stuck in your head.

70
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,261
Scott: Remember the sound of that kind of instrument.

71
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:37,524
Rym: so having a four note Riff kind of thing, but how does the riff go listen to this?

72
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:38,830
Rym: the first two notes of the riff?

73
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,437
Rym: It's in your head.

74
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:40,268
Rym: You can hear it right now.

75
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,079
Scott: No because it doesn't continue with that instrument.

76
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:55,090
Scott: that instrument only plays that little bit and the rest of the song does not involve that.

77
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,822
Rym: Can you name any other song that has a similar instrument?

78
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:03,890
Rym: no no no I Don't think you've got anything stuck in your head.

79
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:08,930
Rym: I do or I think you've got so little stuck in your head that you've kind of found an exception of the human brain.

80
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:12,942
Rym: It's so little that you will never be able to identify it.

81
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:14,950
Rym: and even if you do you won't be sure if it's it.

82
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,517
Rym: So you'll never get it.

83
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:17,623
Scott: if I hear it for real.

84
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:18,990
Scott: I'll be absolutely sure that it's it.

85
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,918
Rym: How do you know what if you hear something similar?

86
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:23,330
Scott: because the NP problem you can easily verify.

87
00:04:23,953 --> 00:04:30,390
Rym: See the trouble is there are so many songs that are so similar that what if you hear a song And you're not sure if it's it, but it's the closest you'll ever get?

88
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:38,494
Scott: That'll be bad, but yes Even if I'm sure it's it and it's even if it's not it as long as I'm sure it's it I'll still feel alright.

89
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:41,606
Scott: You're sure it goes four times, and it's for definitely four notes.

90
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:42,510
Scott: that is for definite.

91
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,058
Rym: She said how long is each note?

92
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,450
Rym: not very long like a second.

93
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:48,941
Scott: Yeah, it's like maybe like one measure is like the whole thing.

94
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:50,488
Rym: one measure could last like 40 years.

95
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:53,216
Scott: You know what I'm saying?

96
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:53,818
Rym: no, I don't.

97
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:55,847
Rym: what's the time signature?

98
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:56,610
Rym: What key is it in?

99
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,861
Rym: That's a time signature is not you waving your hand at me.

100
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:06,218
Scott: It's like a Couple seconds of you know.

101
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,570
Scott: maybe one half seconds ish.

102
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,310
Rym: Wow Scott, I mean, I'll pick a song.

103
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,490
Rym: I know that you know too, and it goes dead to dip and I don't remember the rest.

104
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:17,358
Rym: What song is that?

105
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:18,449
Rym: I mean you're fucked.

106
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:19,557
Scott: Yeah, you know what.

107
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:21,450
Scott: someone's gonna find out the song and it's got the song.

108
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:23,136
Rym: I know the song I'm thinking of.

109
00:05:23,518 --> 00:05:25,566
Rym: you know the song very well, but did?

110
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,429
Rym: it is not enough.

111
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:29,830
Scott: It would be enough if I heard the actual recording and not just you dead.

112
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,561
Rym: But no one's going to hear the actual recording of your thing.

113
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:37,413
Rym: They're gonna hear you going dead dead dead dead I you know.

114
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:48,690
Rym: I think someone actually will though post a link and I'll figure out what the song is of a violin going and Up or down at least four times and then another instrument that isn't the same techno violin.

115
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:52,422
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's a something we dancy song which limits it quite a bit.

116
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:53,366
Rym: not that much.

117
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:55,472
Scott: It's possibly a hit Scott.

118
00:05:55,552 --> 00:06:04,758
Rym: I downloaded a torrent some years ago of every dance pop song from 1980 to 1989 Legitimately released in the United States.

119
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:06,645
Rym: I think that there are a lot of them.

120
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,280
Scott: I think that this is a 2009 tennis song.

121
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,669
Rym: so what do you base that on?

122
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:19,183
Scott: Just because the song that I never heard a long time ago, but I feel like I've heard it recently Aha, just feeling any idea where?

123
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:20,450
Rym: when did it get stuck in your head?

124
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,850
Scott: I think it got in my head a long time ago, but then reemerged in my head.

125
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,095
Rym: reemerge because So what triggered it?

126
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:34,429
Rym: you got to figure out what triggered it and that will lead you toward the answer.

127
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:38,209
Scott: brains They do things.

128
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:45,250
Rym: So I guess normally this is when we'd talk about anime news that being anime night, but there's only one anime news.

129
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:46,362
Rym: I didn't believe it.

130
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:52,010
Rym: Darryl Surratt Messaged me and I guess everyone else in the world that he knows on the internet in a panic.

131
00:06:52,091 --> 00:07:04,789
Scott: Well actually before he messaged me I saw the tweet or a retweet from Murayama who was like someone important to the studio has died And I was like okay, and I just sort of ignored it until I got the message.

132
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:09,810
Rym: Yeah, the message I got and I think Darryl Surratt put it more eloquently than anyone else in the world.

133
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,215
Scott: What he said this is bullshit.

134
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:11,937
Rym: He said quotes.

135
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:14,746
Rym: Satoshi Kon is fucking dead.

136
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:15,970
Rym: That is some bullshit.

137
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:17,495
Scott: That is some bullshit indeed.

138
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:18,759
Scott: And that is not just some bullshit.

139
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:19,802
Scott: That's all the bullshit.

140
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:22,990
Rym: I can't even this is you know, what's bullshit?

141
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:36,318
Rym: It's actually take care on so many levels mainly because you know We myself Scout and Emily went to a retrospective of Satoshi Collins works in New York City Not that long ago and I know he had.

142
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:40,410
Rym: they screened paprika and then he came out and talked to us and he was really cool.

143
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:45,350
Rym: And he very pointedly said I'm paraphrasing because it was translated and I'm going on memory.

144
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,610
Rym: He said four notes played I think by a techno violin.

145
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:55,009
Rym: He basically said I feel that this is too much of an honor for me.

146
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:58,310
Rym: I'm just too early in my career for you to give me a retrospective.

147
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:04,019
Rym: Let me come back after I've actually done something Mm-hmm, and he never did anything else.

148
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,567
Rym: No movie of his came out after that.

149
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:07,008
Rym: That was it.

150
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:17,990
Scott: Yeah, I mean that was the first time we saw like a single still image of the movie that he's doing next Which you can see on the website for that movie the dream machine, which has a robot in it

151
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,336
Rym: It looks like the but

152
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,884
Scott: I mean they already spent.

153
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:22,170
Scott: there's a sunk cost fallacy.

154
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,730
Scott: They're probably gonna finish, you know, they haven't said anything but I can almost guarantee they're gonna finish the movie without him.

155
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,719
Scott: But is that really gonna be a good movie now?

156
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,530
Scott: I mean maybe part, you know, and then that's gonna be it, right?

157
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,133
Scott: That's it.

158
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:36,982
Scott: He didn't work on anything else.

159
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:50,052
Rym: So Yeah, it's just I know it bothers me primarily aside from every other reason I mean there have been directors and celebrities and people that I've seen die or I've known about and then they died and I was Sad.

160
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:57,190
Rym: but like how Miyazaki has had a full career I feel like he is trying desperately to die in the middle of his last film.

161
00:08:58,792 --> 00:08:59,977
Rym: But he keeps going.

162
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:05,009
Rym: he keeps making things and I feel like while it would be sad if he died He has done a lot.

163
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,335
Rym: Tezuka did a lot.

164
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:08,625
Scott: I feel like he died when he was 60 though.

165
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:11,570
Rym: So that was still pretty early It was but he still did a lot.

166
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,159
Rym: I feel like Satoshi khan would have done twice.

167
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,628
Rym: again is more and and even more.

168
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:21,128
Rym: beyond that I can't imagine what he would have done if he had lived another 40 years.

169
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,258
Scott: It also doesn't help right that like.

170
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,669
Scott: really who else was you know?

171
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:28,357
Scott: Making the hits right in terms of anime.

172
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:36,690
Scott: They're really, you know in terms of like greatest living anime director I mean, okay, maybe Miyazaki is better in terms of his whole body of work.

173
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:53,910
Scott: But Miyazaki lately not really Mamoru Oshii lately not really Satoshi khan in terms of what have you done for me lately is Even in death probably the greatest current anime director, you know in terms of the stuff that he's done recently.

174
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,349
Scott: What other anime movies in any recent year in the past decade?

175
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:01,100
Rym: There is good.

176
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:02,389
Rym: I can think I get why I get.

177
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:07,205
Scott: no I guess decade does allow you to bring in like spirited away and stuff, but like piyazaki.

178
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:10,741
Rym: Yeah past few years We'll have to go to things like Mamoru Hosoda.

179
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:15,089
Scott: Yeah, right, which is Next level down from so she can at least.

180
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:16,814
Rym: What's really sad?

181
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:18,259
Rym: Well, I guess I keep saying what's really sad.

182
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,584
Rym: It's all really sad.

183
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:20,668
Scott: It's all said I was.

184
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,886
Rym: I mean It's rare that I'm taken aback by the loss of someone like.

185
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:24,610
Scott: I know right?

186
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,067
Scott: It's weird and it I think we're really says something is okay.

187
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:31,740
Scott: Look, okay He's made all these great movies and a great TV show right?

188
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:34,450
Scott: He was he was really awesome and beloved by anime fans.

189
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:41,230
Rym: He was also one of his of the like the successor series of anime directors and anime people.

190
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:51,013
Rym: He's one of those people who worked under a great did key animation things like that and worked up and became the great Yep, there aren't that many anime directors Right.

191
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:54,467
Scott: So having a big reaction in the anime community is kind of expected.

192
00:10:54,507 --> 00:11:00,270
Scott: but his movies Honestly, at least outside of Japan especially are not that well known, you know, they're on DVD.

193
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:06,449
Scott: They go to a movie theater for a short run maybe But most people have no idea who he is or never heard of any of his movies.

194
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,917
Scott: But yet it wasn't.

195
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:12,910
Scott: just like anime news net where you know, a Crayon Shinshan crater died.

196
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,470
Scott: Remember he got like lost or fell off a cliff or something like that when he went into the woods.

197
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,014
Scott: Right, that's a big deal.

198
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,759
Scott: Crayon Shinshan manga crater.

199
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,670
Scott: That's a like an epic ultra famous manga with elephant dances in it.

200
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,177
Scott: You know, it's been going on forever You know, but they didn't.

201
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:31,270
Scott: the only place you heard about that was anime news network at least in English.

202
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:42,696
Scott: But Satoshi khan, you know at least 24 hours, you know this morning he died yesterday, right but this morning Kotaku boing boing Every freaking blog.

203
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:45,424
Scott: right, you know, that is, you know gaming.

204
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,410
Scott: everything was posting about it.

205
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,583
Rym: Not just the anime site speaks of how powerful his movies were.

206
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:52,270
Rym: I mean look at his entire body of work.

207
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:55,683
Rym: It's not just that he never had a miss or he never had a bomb.

208
00:11:56,145 --> 00:12:00,277
Rym: It's that without exception Everything he made was brilliant.

209
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:04,630
Scott: and it's not just like I'm sure like he says his manga wasn't brilliant and haven't read it.

210
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,608
Rym: Yeah, I haven't read it either.

211
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:19,283
Scott: So aside from his manga all the all the things that he's known for, you know starting with you know Like rojansy perfect blue, you know magnetic rose and You know the paprika paranoia agent.

212
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:20,650
Rym: and it's not just us saying this.

213
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,802
Rym: It's not just like hardcore anime fans saying this.

214
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:28,933
Rym: his movies had a real Universal appeal and they were so different from everything else I watch and they're

215
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:44,170
Scott: like the only you know in terms like we grew up watching some animes like Akira and some leji Matsumoto stuff and that kind of thing, right and that's the reason we like to anime were those kinds of anime And he's really the only person who is still making those kinds of anime.

216
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:49,410
Scott: So it's not just sad for the death of him and the things that he will not create.

217
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:53,970
Scott: But also it's like the kind of anime that we like has died.

218
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:55,375
Scott: You know, where?

219
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:57,381
Scott: where is the kind of anime we like now?

220
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:57,963
Scott: It's gone.

221
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,870
Scott: There's no more who's gonna make it.

222
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:12,965
Scott: No one that no one that we know of is who is capable of making the kind of anime we like is either Passed on or is no longer making the kind of anime we like or no longer making anime period or is making anime We don't like.

223
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,694
Scott: So it just.

224
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,740
Scott: it's just bad though.

225
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:20,710
Rym: I what got me is I wasn't really moved to tears.

226
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,390
Rym: It takes a lot to actually make me feel that like watching Jim Henson's funeral again.

227
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,241
Scott: That is the ultimate crying weapon that brought me down.

228
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:30,510
Rym: but I was reading anime news network posted.

229
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,930
Rym: It was difficult to get to his site because it was just destroyed under the just the massive traffic.

230
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:38,545
Rym: But some of his final words are there for reading.

231
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,377
Rym: an anime news network is likely Translated some of them.

232
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:50,152
Rym: and in regards to his the new movie I'm pretty sure it's going to be finished and it's going to be what he wanted because it was written by him Right.

233
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:50,714
Scott: So he wrote it.

234
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:55,010
Rym: the screenplay everything was by him and the art director in the character design were someone else.

235
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,570
Rym: So I have a feeling they'll be able to finish it close to his vision.

236
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:02,460
Rym: But a quote from his some of his last words.

237
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:07,517
Rym: when I conveyed my concerns for Yumei Muru Kikai to mr Murayama, he said it's fine.

238
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:07,979
Rym: Don't worry.

239
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,547
Rym: We'll do whatever it takes.

240
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:15,110
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, Murayama is like a champ and the thing was Gerald pointed out in a tweet, right?

241
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,620
Scott: Murayama was at Otakon as he always is.

242
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,384
Scott: He never misses it.

243
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:24,204
Scott: Yeah, he's staff and You know people were asking him because he's the head of studio madhouse.

244
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:31,942
Scott: right who does all of you know Satoshi khan stuff and the people are asking him about Satoshi khan Of course because that of all of the stuff studio madhouse does.

245
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:34,594
Scott: that's the stuff we want the most Right.

246
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:37,269
Scott: tell us about the dream machine, you know, come on give it up.

247
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:45,550
Scott: But he knew at that point right that Satoshi khan was you know done for so it's like Gerald was like.

248
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:49,830
Scott: What was he thinking when people are asking him that at Otakon that must have been really tough.

249
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:55,570
Rym: Yeah, you know like whoa and and the worst thing is I mean it was pancreatic cancer.

250
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,418
Rym: It's almost no one survives pancreatic cancer.

251
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,280
Rym: It's basically you're.

252
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:02,168
Scott: it's like, you know talk about you know, oh my whoa.

253
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,690
Rym: Oh, I mean by the time you detect it, it's too late.

254
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,255
Rym: There's really nothing you can do.

255
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:12,430
Rym: even massive crazy treatment gives you like a 5% chance of living five years.

256
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:16,692
Scott: The biggest problem is simply that you don't really feel anything in your pancreas Right.

257
00:15:16,752 --> 00:15:25,208
Scott: and like if you have cancer on your skin, you can see it even though that's really bad, too Right, but if you have cancer in the lung, it's like I can't breathe.

258
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,550
Scott: it hurts.

259
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:29,915
Scott: You know you have pains and things but when you have cancer in the pancreas You don't feel that.

260
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:34,301
Scott: and as long unless it makes such a giant lump that it sticks out or something You're not even notice that.

261
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:41,114
Scott: so Until it spreads to another part of your body where you can feel it and you know Then go to the doctor.

262
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:43,907
Scott: you're the doctor is not even gonna really check for it.

263
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:44,650
Scott: you go to a physical.

264
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:51,610
Scott: They don't check you for pancreatic cancer, you know, maybe if you happen to get a blood test They would see cancer cells floating around in there.

265
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,559
Scott: But even then you're and you're in big trouble if you're already that far gone.

266
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,769
Scott: So it's it's pretty much the worst.

267
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,333
Scott: Everything's the worst.

268
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:05,010
Rym: Yeah, and it's you know, like Emily I were talking about this a lot last night.

269
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:13,698
Rym: There are some people who are artists like Jim Henson where they did no wrong and they kind of were taken away Suddenly when they said a lot more potential.

270
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:20,510
Rym: and there are people who start out just as strong But either complete their career and just go down in history as legends.

271
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:29,135
Rym: Yeah or the one like the Michael Jackson who start out and they're weird when they die and something weird happens and it almost It doesn't quite have the same impact.

272
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:33,086
Scott: No, it's definitely far more, you know, cuz like we didn't.

273
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:39,623
Scott: you know, we met him once Right, the man lived, you know Too short, but 47 46 47 years, but he had such impact.

274
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:45,049
Rym: I couldn't help but think back to meeting him and I it was yeah, it was tough.

275
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,798
Scott: Yeah, it's that but it's like it does.

276
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:50,306
Rym: it hurts that he was so cool in person too.

277
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:51,570
Scott: He was just a normal guy.

278
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,903
Scott: It's like it wasn't like, you know.

279
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:58,970
Scott: Meanwhile, somebody like the niche who's all drugged up and whatnot and playing with guns is just fine, right?

280
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:01,411
Rym: What Was it?

281
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:02,174
Rym: someone on Fark.

282
00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:06,310
Rym: they were talking about this and he basically said why couldn't it have been M night?

283
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,555
Scott: Well, and I was.

284
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:22,640
Scott: I went to 2chan and there was a gigantic thread with like thousands of posts in it Right and I pumped it through the Google Translator and the only one that I saw that was kind of funny and well Translated or relatively well translated was it was a short comment.

285
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,705
Scott: It said please instead of Satoshi.

286
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:25,809
Scott: Khan is Mamoru.

287
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:35,086
Scott: Oh she And it's like, you know, Mamoru she he made a lot of great animes probably more great animes that.

288
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:45,686
Scott: so she Khan is made but It's like he's sort of done ish, you know, it's like he made sky callers, which is pretty good But I would put sky callers below pretty much every.

289
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:46,430
Scott: she has the problem.

290
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,890
Rym: So she Khan is done as we always say where the things he's best at the things he at least seems to want to do.

291
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:53,365
Rym: Yeah, we want him to make action comedy anime.

292
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:53,888
Rym: He wants to make.

293
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,047
Scott: If Mamoru she died it's like it would be sad but it wouldn't be.

294
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:03,339
Scott: as Said I guess even if Miyazaki died, it wouldn't be.

295
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,921
Scott: as said.

296
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:04,262
Rym: there's just.

297
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:04,924
Rym: there's something.

298
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:11,587
Rym: there's a confluence of factors around Satoshi Kong that made the impact just universally felt among anyone who enjoys art.

299
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:18,448
Rym: Mm-hmm It's a dark day for anime - I mean look look at the entire landscape of anime and animation has changed.

300
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:19,030
Scott: probably.

301
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:37,189
Scott: I mean you look at just celebrity deaths in general and it's rare that you see one that comes so early in someone who is so awesome who is still a lot to go and Didn't have any weirdness at all, you know, even when you see something like a river Phoenix, right?

302
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:44,758
Scott: It's like well He was drugged up, you know, it's like there was you know, you don't you're not gonna you know Cry over someone who's all drug addicted and whatnot.

303
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:45,199
Scott: Yeah.

304
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:47,447
Rym: Well you will but I don't know it.

305
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:48,430
Rym: just it feels different.

306
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,010
Scott: This is the other thing is that we weren't really alive when John Lennon was shot.

307
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,048
Scott: I think that's pretty much one of the only things you can compare it to.

308
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:59,186
Rym: yeah I'm pretty sure that people who live through that feel about the same way that we do now.

309
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:04,185
Rym: Yeah What really got me though was the final update on the website.

310
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:10,306
Rym: to quote Satoshi Kong It's basically his last public words with feelings of gratitude for all that is good in the world.

311
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:11,210
Rym: I put down my pen.

312
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,831
Rym: Well, I'll be leaving now.

313
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:14,512
Scott: That's pretty much it.

314
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:30,726
Rym: So one more lighthearted note things of the day All right, I'm gonna go.

315
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:31,269
Rym: you want to go.

316
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:32,416
Rym: so I had.

317
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:32,999
Rym: I have to.

318
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:35,346
Scott: You know, I got to.

319
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:36,750
Scott: I got this problem lately.

320
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:39,359
Scott: right where you know what an itch?

321
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:51,692
Scott: No Where you know, I want to go somewhere maybe on my bicycle or some such right, but I got to carry some things like wallet Phone keys, you know that sort of thing.

322
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,120
Rym: You could carry a purse, right?

323
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,826
Scott: So I put my bag, you know, and I take that's to match the shoes obvious My whole bag to work right on my back.

324
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,906
Scott: But that's a lot to carry.

325
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:11,340
Scott: and if I'm not going somewhere where I need to carry that whole bag Timbuktu bag what's you know, that's a big pain in the butt to carry the huge bags.

326
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,737
Rym: I'll admit the bag was much more useful when I had the long commute now.

327
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:16,447
Rym: I don't really care I carry nothing on me.

328
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:18,480
Scott: Yeah, but I still need to carry some stuff.

329
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:26,437
Scott: Now the thing is I could put in my pockets if I'm walking but if I'm biking Phone might just come out of the pocket land in the street get run over by a car pants.

330
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:27,140
Rym: Are you wearing?

331
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,931
Scott: Nothing falls out of pockets if I'm biking it totally good.

332
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:37,420
Scott: No, you got terrible pants, then I guess I'm not wearing tight girly jeans where everything is like right up next to my skin.

333
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:45,275
Scott: But anyway, I found this product which is not our existing product yet, but check it out.

334
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:47,260
Scott: this is the fit kit.

335
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:49,372
Rym: I've seen a million things like that.

336
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:50,420
Rym: You can buy them for like 10 bucks.

337
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,338
Scott: Look at this target, but look this one is like totally perfect and even has a metro card in the picture.

338
00:20:55,358 --> 00:20:59,093
Scott: I mean And an iPhone 4. it's like that's for me, right?

339
00:20:59,153 --> 00:21:00,460
Scott: I have a metro card and an iPhone.

340
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,280
Rym: It's one of those fancy things you wrap around your arm and it holds your wallet.

341
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:09,025
Scott: But look you can also wrap it around a water bottle or or yoga mat Cylindrically shaped object.

342
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:13,878
Scott: right now the here's the interesting more interesting thing than this awesome product itself, right?

343
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:24,959
Scott: Which is pretty awesome Is the website it's on is a website called the quirky Calm and the way quirky works is it's sort of like Kickstarter for cool shit All right.

344
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:38,570
Scott: so you go on here and you have a product and you put up images of this product you've designed and after you put up a price and You put up the discounted price and as soon as a certain number of people buy it Then it becomes a real product.

345
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:42,849
Scott: and if it never becomes a real product They never charge you because they don't charge you until it's ready.

346
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:49,299
Scott: So I basically made a promise to pay $25, but they didn't actually take any dollars from me.

347
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,860
Scott: So if it never happens it never happens.

348
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,989
Scott: But if it does happen, I totally get one.

349
00:21:53,572 --> 00:22:01,055
Scott: and this site has a bunch of other cool products like here's some things to help you, you know, here's look at this a crazy Swiss Army knife thing.

350
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:06,350
Scott: and here's a dustpan that has Prongs in it to let you clean the broom more easily.

351
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:14,295
Scott: and here's a thing to help you cool Cool wine without getting water all over the place You know, uh-huh.

352
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:15,946
Scott: So that's cool.

353
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:18,480
Scott: Yeah is a whole bunch of cool stuff on here.

354
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,769
Scott: It's sort of like Kickstarter Etsy combo.

355
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:30,791
Rym: much more important is this mashup of the fuck you Song that has been making the rounds lately with the Shawshank Redemption.

356
00:22:31,272 --> 00:22:32,294
Scott: That's a pretty good mashup.

357
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:32,715
Scott: I like.

358
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:34,459
Rym: I like this sort of thing.

359
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:36,439
Rym: I mean we see it every now and then.

360
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,943
Scott: That's the best part of this.

361
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,847
Rym: was it done with a violin?

362
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:43,689
Rym: four times?

363
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:51,490
Rym: no sure yeah, I Almost like when you have the idea for the enemy music video.

364
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,273
Rym: That's just perfect.

365
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,200
Rym: Like what if I just did Linkin Park?

366
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,576
Rym: Crawling to Dragon Ball Z like it fits so well that you just got to do it.

367
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:00,840
Rym: Well, this is a situation.

368
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:03,487
Rym: I mean look at this movie.

369
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:04,369
Rym: does this song?

370
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:09,663
Rym: had that song existed in the time and when the movie was made Would it not have worked?

371
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:13,257
Scott: You know, I forget the actual song that was used in the movie.

372
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:22,515
Rym: in my mind It's already rewritten as I wonder I think we're going to see more and more.

373
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:33,125
Rym: This is a total aside Mainstream ish songs that have such vulgar language in them that the radio really can't even get away with bleeping it out Like they do already.

374
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,252
Scott: This isn't a mainstream song.

375
00:23:34,272 --> 00:23:35,319
Scott: There's like an internet song.

376
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:37,870
Rym: But what about when that becomes mainstream?

377
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:40,460
Scott: then of course people radio be gone?

378
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:42,945
Rym: What's the radio gonna play?

379
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:44,189
Rym: just 50s music forever?

380
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:45,153
Scott: Just be Internet's only.

381
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,619
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

382
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:54,139
Rym: So because that was kind of weak, I mean it's fun, but you can watch the first 30 seconds of this and you'll get it.

383
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,528
Scott: Yeah, and let you know unless you haven't seen the Shawshank Redemption I mean in which case what the fuck is wrong with you.

384
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:09,440
Rym: They get points for executing to complete V to the Netflix Because I will admit that the original born to be alive with horn was just a concept.

385
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,165
Rym: They're like, hey, here's the joke.

386
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:17,244
Rym: and they made like a 30-second music video, but this guy had the joke and made the full thing Mm-hmm.

387
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:18,752
Scott: So it wasn't much work.

388
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,320
Scott: You didn't even really have to edit the video.

389
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,573
Rym: Nobody edited the audio to make it fit with the scene changes very well.

390
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:24,577
Rym: He also modulated it.

391
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:35,580
Rym: It took some work Yeah, but to make up for the fact that that wasn't punchy I Present to you a video of a kid putting an egg on a skateboard and trying to launch it in the air as a catapult.

392
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,410
Scott: Well, isn't this just a freaking own video?

393
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,160
Scott: It is my key is on better than that.

394
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,725
Rym: So here's why I picked this.

395
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:48,028
Rym: over all the own videos that I could have picked one the kid Clearly thinks that something awesome is going to happen.

396
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,336
Rym: He puts the eggs not even aiming at anyone.

397
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:53,299
Rym: from what I can tell exactly I don't even know why he's filming this.

398
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:57,819
Rym: He's puts the egg on the skateboard stands in front of it and then stops on the skateboard.

399
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:03,229
Rym: now There is no possible outcome But this just hitting him in the face.

400
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,029
Rym: and it does in fact hit him in the face as you would expect Which is fine.

401
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,979
Rym: That would be an own video.

402
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:14,759
Rym: but then he pushes arms down and he stands there looking at himself with this look of how the fuck did that happen?

403
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:23,812
Rym: like he does not realize what he is wrought that he did not foresee and That the last second of this video is why it is my thing of the day.

404
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:32,700
Scott: Yeah, I wish that the Someone can make a video where they launch an egg into the air off the skateboard and then sort of catch it without breaking.

405
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,924
Scott: It's some awesome Parkourish trick.

406
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:42,340
Scott: or maybe we should start a new sub-genre of parkour where you have an egg with you But you're not allowed to put the egg in any sort of sling or holster or grab it.

407
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,356
Scott: The egg has to be free-moving as well.

408
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,450
Scott: You said I have to tap it or bobble it or whatever.

409
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,815
Scott: egg park or dribble it.

410
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:49,698
Rym: no egg park or use.

411
00:25:49,738 --> 00:25:54,860
Rym: have a race First one or simultaneously first one to the top of the building with the egg wins.

412
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:57,380
Scott: But you can't actually grasp the egg.

413
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,384
Scott: You have to constantly.

414
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:02,220
Scott: egg has to be in motion, you know sort of like in basketball or bottle.

415
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:03,987
Scott: Yeah, that would be.

416
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:05,373
Scott: or like you could balance it on your head.

417
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:06,056
Scott: That would be okay.

418
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:10,059
Scott: like all the way Double egg all the way.

419
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:21,345
Rym: So we went to the theater not that long ago In fact this weekend and we saw a slightly older anime movie a Miyazaki movie that we had not seen Studio Ghibli movie.

420
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:24,176
Rym: Yes, Studio Ghibli Miyazaki can't lose right?

421
00:26:24,658 --> 00:26:28,640
Scott: which uh Miyazaki was that was that high on.

422
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,434
Rym: Goro go to make good tournament schedule.

423
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:38,208
Scott: I'm sorry go to Goro nepotism give you job.

424
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:49,960
Rym: Ursula K Le Guin sadly probably said it best Because I've you know ghetto Sankey tales of Earthsea is nominally based on four of the Earthsea books.

425
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,600
Scott: Well, I think it's mostly based on the third one, which I read a long time ago.

426
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:57,380
Scott: But it says it's based on even really based on it.

427
00:26:57,761 --> 00:27:01,412
Scott: It's based on them in that they use the same proper nouns.

428
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:02,877
Scott: That's pretty much it.

429
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:10,658
Rym: Yeah And even then they say get like once the title is ghetto Sankey and yet they refer to was sparrowhawk.

430
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,445
Rym: the whole time I think his name get get said.

431
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:13,851
Scott: Well, that's in the book.

432
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,860
Scott: You know, that's usually how it goes as well.

433
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,264
Rym: Well, yes, right.

434
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:18,427
Scott: You have never read the books.

435
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:19,570
Scott: You have no fucking clue.

436
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,094
Rym: Yeah, why why why?

437
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:24,703
Scott: and if Forget is in the title.

438
00:27:24,784 --> 00:27:28,093
Scott: Why is the main character Aaron the prince guy?

439
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:36,400
Rym: Ursula K Le Guin first said and I quote It is not my book No, it is your movie it is a good movie.

440
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:43,880
Rym: But then later she said and I quote and this really really really puts it into perspective.

441
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:49,599
Rym: This was the result of quote when too much responsibility was shouldered by someone not equipped for it.

442
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,723
Rym: Mm-hmm.

443
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:53,412
Rym: This movie was pretty terrible.

444
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:54,856
Scott: Oh, well, you wasn't.

445
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:57,571
Scott: I wouldn't say it's terrible I would just say you remove.

446
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:58,760
Scott: I would just say was mediocre.

447
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:08,429
Rym: I will say this if you remove the fact that the animation is lush and beautiful if remove the beauty of the Animation the technical beauty of the of the film.

448
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,071
Rym: Mm-hmm.

449
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,097
Rym: It's not even mediocre.

450
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,965
Rym: the plot Consists of basically nothing.

451
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:20,646
Rym: I would argue that the vast majority of the scenes in this movie do not advance any plot or any characters Motivation whatsoever.

452
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:25,849
Scott: the ones that I think the scenes that really get me are You know scenes where maybe.

453
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,980
Scott: so there's two kinds of scenes that really bothered me.

454
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,241
Scott: right.

455
00:28:28,462 --> 00:28:34,403
Scott: one is the kind of thing where you think it's an interesting scene and maybe they're setting something up and maybe something'll come of It and then they don't.

456
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:39,890
Scott: but then and it's useless like the scene where he gets like accosted by the drug dealer It's like oh that was kind of interesting.

457
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:41,500
Scott: The dealer is an interesting character.

458
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:45,820
Scott: Maybe something would happen there and no it was completely in the cold context of the movie.

459
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,806
Scott: That seemed didn't even mean it.

460
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:48,498
Rym: and the worst part is so later in the movie, right?

461
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:52,795
Rym: Dude gets poisoned and his lips turn the same color as that poison.

462
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:55,227
Rym: and because of the plot you think oh Maybe they're doing something up.

463
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:57,199
Rym: Not at all and nothing not related.

464
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,705
Rym: Neither scene was necessary.

465
00:28:58,725 --> 00:29:03,580
Scott: other kind of scene that bothered me is the nothing scene like put the ox in the bar.

466
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:06,820
Rym: Okay, I will go put the ox in the barn cut to the barn.

467
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,059
Scott: He literally put the ox in the barn two or three times, but never did he actually put the ox in the barn.

468
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:14,283
Rym: Now the thing is.

469
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:19,823
Rym: a scene like that is fine, we love oshi movies where there's just long Stretches.

470
00:29:19,864 --> 00:29:20,886
Scott: look at evangelical.

471
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:21,528
Scott: how many see?

472
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:28,312
Scott: awesome scenes are there where someone's just quietly walking down the street or looking at the window While you hear the cicadas and look at the trees in sky crawler?

473
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:30,240
Scott: remind you that it's summer and it's really hot.

474
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:37,970
Rym: I was in raptured by a scene where he sits there for a while slowly gets up turns around opens the fridge gets an orange Soda closes his fridge turns around slowly drinks it.

475
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:38,411
Scott: Yep,

476
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:53,160
Rym: but in all those movies Every time you see this, you know atmosphere is what makes anime good atmosphere is one of the things that's common in anime that we Like when they'll have scenes that set an atmosphere or a mood and those sorts of scenes are often missing from Western film.

477
00:29:53,761 --> 00:30:00,059
Rym: but when those scenes add nothing to the movie whatsoever and literally are just boring.

478
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,860
Scott: and Well, I think what makes them boring right in this movie is that think about the cicadas from revenge alien, right?

479
00:30:07,342 --> 00:30:09,032
Scott: It's just you know, nothing really moves.

480
00:30:09,415 --> 00:30:10,260
Scott: There's nothing happening.

481
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,027
Scott: It's just cricket cricket cricket.

482
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:14,739
Scott: It's summer, you know, cicadas cicadas cicadas, right?

483
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,930
Scott: Well, you look at this in in in this movie.

484
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,034
Scott: What would you get instead?

485
00:30:19,094 --> 00:30:20,560
Scott: you would get quiet?

486
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:26,660
Scott: Look, here is a building and you see one of the characters walking slowly and quietly.

487
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,960
Scott: They're just walking and they're doing something completely mundane and not symbolic in any way.

488
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,989
Scott: they're actually doing something like, you know plowing a field or Cooking something and there it's about.

489
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:40,114
Scott: it's not symbolic.

490
00:30:40,194 --> 00:30:44,220
Scott: It's not setting it Mood, it's just someone doing something.

491
00:30:44,863 --> 00:30:54,600
Scott: It's like you might as well show me hit this whole walk through the grocery store Comparing the cereals and picking one and then checking out one item at a time and then bagging the groceries.

492
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:55,826
Scott: It's like it's not symbolic.

493
00:30:55,846 --> 00:30:57,153
Scott: I think it's not setting a mood.

494
00:30:57,193 --> 00:30:58,620
Scott: It's just someone doing boring shit.

495
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:05,367
Rym: I think the trouble is even more fundamental than that because in movies where there are like a long slice of life scene like you All right, they're farming.

496
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:08,400
Rym: maybe the farming and the plowing is because they're bonding over something.

497
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:11,296
Rym: maybe there's some kind of implicit character development.

498
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:22,160
Rym: or Maybe they've already set up that you like these characters and now they're giving you this slice of life So that later when their their routine is ruined by the plot you feel sympathetic for them being pulled out of that.

499
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,849
Scott: Yeah, like you plow the field and then you plow the field again But then someone come something happens during that.

500
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:36,087
Rym: so or you call the field and you get all the screen time about plowing the field In the montage of them doing this or maybe The field gets destroyed.

501
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:40,740
Scott: or maybe they're giving advice about plowing the field and something about plowing the field.

502
00:31:41,063 --> 00:31:55,753
Scott: Some sort of you know Like lesson some life lesson while about plowing like work hard or something in the later on Says the same thing again when he's got to fight the bad guy like remember the plowing of the field He's on wax off.

503
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:56,520
Scott: exactly.

504
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,643
Scott: That's exactly what.

505
00:31:57,663 --> 00:32:01,595
Rym: there's a scene where the main character is plowing and gay.

506
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:03,080
Rym: it is helping him plan against blisters.

507
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:08,740
Rym: And he's like you have blisters and he looks at his hand and then they show us the blisters like oh he's got blisters now.

508
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,210
Rym: Maybe they're setting up some metaphor for he was nobility.

509
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:15,280
Rym: He'd never worked the land before he'd never lived a normal life.

510
00:32:15,863 --> 00:32:17,251
Rym: Maybe they're setting up some sort.

511
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,780
Rym: There's all sorts of things they could have been doing.

512
00:32:19,422 --> 00:32:21,910
Rym: No, then get says we should want to rest a little bit.

513
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:23,415
Rym: Okay, they rest they continue.

514
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:24,980
Rym: that never comes up again here.

515
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,825
Scott: You want to hear something?

516
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:28,540
Scott: Here's something that probably the worst thing in the whole movie, right?

517
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:32,252
Scott: So the opening scene of the movie the prince kills the king.

518
00:32:32,272 --> 00:32:33,336
Rym: Oh, all right.

519
00:32:33,356 --> 00:32:34,560
Rym: So I think we should just double away.

520
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,698
Scott: That's not the worst part of it for no, you know for a reason that's never explained or explored That doesn't come up at all.

521
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:44,536
Scott: But the real problem right was remember those two girls who were like appealing for the prince.

522
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:46,117
Rym: I forgot about that All right.

523
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:52,100
Scott: So there's these girls appealing for the prince and as if they're going to be important characters and there's something about them.

524
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:58,958
Scott: Movie at all ever not after that one scene and that means not it.

525
00:32:59,098 --> 00:32:59,640
Rym: What about root?

526
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,180
Rym: No character from the beginning of the movie is in the end of the movie or even the middle of the movie.

527
00:33:05,162 --> 00:33:14,120
Rym: Now you can if there was a Hitchcock movie I mean Pessacchio starts with a heist and this woman's getting away with the heist and then oh shit serial killer and no one saw that coming.

528
00:33:14,682 --> 00:33:16,790
Rym: I guess I spoiled Pessacchio if you've never seen it.

529
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:18,597
Scott: Oh, no, as long as you didn't spoil psycho.

530
00:33:18,658 --> 00:33:19,240
Scott: It is actually.

531
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,719
Scott: But This is no one really wants to see Pessacchio.

532
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:29,600
Rym: Imagine if I don't know the matrix started right and you meet all these characters.

533
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:30,623
Rym: What is the matrix?

534
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:35,540
Rym: and Neo and Morpheus and then it just kind of cuts to these other people and that's the whole rest of?

535
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:35,941
Rym: The movie.

536
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:40,320
Scott: and they never go back except except for one character who's still there, but that's it.

537
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:43,250
Rym: Yeah, but even then the prince is barely there.

538
00:33:43,451 --> 00:33:44,715
Rym: He's not in the beginning.

539
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:45,799
Scott: He's not there at all.

540
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:46,060
Scott: That's right.

541
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,496
Scott: They just sort of talk about the Prince until he actually kills his dad.

542
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:51,260
Scott: he just sort of comes out.

543
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,863
Scott: No, that's it.

544
00:33:52,084 --> 00:33:53,972
Rym: So you don't even know it's his dad at first.

545
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:55,560
Rym: So here's the movie right it opens.

546
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:56,000
Rym: so yeah.

547
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:05,512
Scott: So the movie would open with all the characters of the matrix and then some guy would stab Morpheus and the movie would be about the guy who stabbed Morpheus and none and Morpheus and none of the other characters that ever appear again.

548
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:07,908
Rym: So the movie starts right.

549
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:10,100
Rym: it opens, you know credits Miyazaki movie.

550
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:16,655
Rym: Let's go and There's a ship and it's all beautiful and there's dragons and the dragons fight and that never happens.

551
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:18,199
Scott: and you think they just did.

552
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,955
Scott: They just threw the dragons in their fighting's just so that they could open with an action scene.

553
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,058
Scott: with this stuff going on.

554
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:25,606
Rym: and you wonder What's this setting?

555
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,759
Scott: the dragons have nothing to do with the story at all?

556
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:33,382
Rym: Dragons basically don't come back until the end and they come back in a way that is unrelated to the Dragons Mm-hmm.

557
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:35,275
Rym: So dragon scene stops.

558
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:44,069
Rym: now We're in the kingdom and like there's all this political stuff in political discussions and the Kings asking root who I guess is the wizard of the court what's going on?

559
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:49,820
Rym: the world is shifting all this craziness and Then this kid runs out of nowhere and stabs the king.

560
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:51,523
Rym: Yep, that like that.

561
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:53,750
Scott: I don't even know you don't even really get that.

562
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,373
Scott: He's the prince until a little while later.

563
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:59,192
Rym: I Barely remember what happens after that.

564
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:06,702
Rym: and the next thing I know We've got GED Sparrow Hawk and the kid and they're hanging out with this woman in Taru this other girl who has a burn on Her face.

565
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:07,105
Scott: Well, you didn't.

566
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,214
Scott: you didn't read the tomb.

567
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,040
Scott: That's the thing, right?

568
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,033
Scott: They use they borrow all these proper nouns from all the Earthsea books.

569
00:35:13,093 --> 00:35:14,920
Rym: See I'm pretending I know nothing about Earthsea.

570
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,509
Scott: Well, you've only read one book right?

571
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,360
Rym: I started the second one and then I got distracted.

572
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:20,237
Scott: Okay but I mean it's like so.

573
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:25,760
Scott: They give you all these proper nouns the characters of the same names and sort of the same roles.

574
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:28,411
Scott: But on the one hand they don't.

575
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,540
Scott: they really only take the proper nouns.

576
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,009
Scott: They don't take anything else about the characters really.

577
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:35,860
Scott: but at the same time the characters have a lot of discussions.

578
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:37,640
Scott: That will make no sense.

579
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,687
Scott: If you haven't read the books like.

580
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:40,460
Scott: they'll talk about the Wizards of Roke a bunch.

581
00:35:40,942 --> 00:35:42,751
Scott: You have no clue who the Wizards of Roke are.

582
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:46,451
Scott: if you haven't read the Earthsea books You'd be like what the fuck Roke?

583
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:46,833
Scott: what?

584
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:48,319
Scott: but the worst thing is Roke All right.

585
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,239
Rym: So mentioning all these things adding all this side stuff in none of that matters.

586
00:35:52,784 --> 00:36:00,640
Scott: No, it doesn't actually Factor into the plot you see in the movie in any way whatsoever, but they spend time having characters discuss it.

587
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,611
Rym: So I would argue that nothing factors into the plot of the movie.

588
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:11,699
Rym: the plot of the movie if I had to summarize it Is dude kills his dad Wanders off meets an old guy that hang out on a farm for a while.

589
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:13,205
Rym: Pedophile kidnaps him.

590
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:16,900
Rym: his shadow comes and gives a sword to a girl who turns out to be a dragon.

591
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:19,045
Scott: But she's not a dragon.

592
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:19,486
Scott: but she is.

593
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:21,595
Scott: yeah, but there's no reason why it did.

594
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:24,556
Scott: yet her name is Tohono Which is the name of the fourth Earthsea book?

595
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:32,060
Rym: Now Immediately after them alright, so I don't care if you've seen the movie or not.

596
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,823
Rym: We're just spoiling it because there's nothing you know You don't need to go see.

597
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:38,494
Rym: at the end of the movie the girl just turns into a dragon.

598
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:43,090
Rym: no foreshadowing whatsoever In fact, the pedophile old guy kills her.

599
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:44,515
Scott: no explanation whatsoever.

600
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:45,760
Rym: It does a funny dance.

601
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:48,713
Rym: He kills her and then he kind of goes like I guess she's dead.

602
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:49,275
Rym: She's dead.

603
00:36:49,336 --> 00:36:49,778
Rym: She's dead.

604
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:54,772
Rym: She's dead And then she stands back up, and she's like I'm not dead.

605
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,299
Rym: and then she turns into a dragon and kills him.

606
00:36:57,264 --> 00:36:59,840
Rym: Okay, Wow now you're thinking alright.

607
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:12,140
Rym: So maybe you know the dragons never fight with each other and they told us earlier that Teru's mother and father Had left her to die and burned her and that's where she got the scar and they were dead something like that.

608
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:21,935
Rym: So they set this up and in the beginning of the movie two dragons were fighting and one dragon killed another dragon or at least Injured it severely and that was supposed to let you know something's wrong with the world.

609
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:23,300
Scott: so the balance is fucked.

610
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:29,118
Rym: Imagine if the dragon that had fallen was her and she didn't remember she was a dragon until just then.

611
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:35,220
Rym: or What if she was the daughter of the two dragons that had fought and that was the plot of her real and the whole?

612
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,769
Rym: What if she was the protagonist?

613
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,120
Rym: that would have been an awesome movie?

614
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:39,989
Scott: Well this gives you something else right?

615
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:44,228
Scott: is that we watched the dub in the theater And you know what you know.

616
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:46,660
Scott: Disney's usually pretty good with the Miyazaki dubbing.

617
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:48,411
Rym: They definitely phoned this one in.

618
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:49,840
Scott: They phoned it in so bad.

619
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,760
Scott: There were some names in there that were pretty relatively big not as big as like the modern names.

620
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,790
Scott: They had a Mononoke and so.

621
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,840
Rym: Cheech Marin's in there.

622
00:37:56,966 --> 00:38:05,680
Scott: Yeah But really this dub is so phoned in and I'm not sure if I can't tell because they didn't have any Subtitles or anything not that I could understand Japanese anyway.

623
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,250
Scott: But like the dub acting was phoned in.

624
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,840
Scott: but regardless the dub script was bad.

625
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,340
Scott: But was it the dub script that was bad, or was it a good script and just the original script was bad?

626
00:38:16,582 --> 00:38:18,660
Rym: I am pretty sure the original script was bad.

627
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,800
Scott: I think I feel like it was a combination of original bad script and dubbed bad.

628
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:30,480
Rym: No, cause going back through the scenes I can think of no point where any different words said by any character would have made the movie better.

629
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:34,013
Scott: That's that's true, but even so it was.

630
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:35,920
Scott: some of the people said some pretty stupid shit.

631
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,306
Rym: What was with the pedophile at the end?

632
00:38:37,627 --> 00:38:38,109
Rym: What did he?

633
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:39,715
Rym: even he comes out of nowhere?

634
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:40,800
Rym: He's just oh shit.

635
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,322
Rym: He's there.

636
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:42,186
Rym: Oh shit.

637
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:42,568
Rym: He poise.

638
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:43,592
Scott: We gotta go get the bad guy.

639
00:38:43,632 --> 00:38:44,356
Scott: Where's the bad guy?

640
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:45,280
Scott: That's the bad guy.

641
00:38:45,441 --> 00:38:47,560
Scott: We're suddenly showing you a bad guy.

642
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:48,874
Scott: He's obviously bad.

643
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:52,438
Scott: And even then what'd he do?

644
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,042
Scott: He was bad.

645
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:54,944
Scott: What'd he do?

646
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,328
Scott: He upset the ballad.

647
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:57,111
Rym: But how?

648
00:38:57,411 --> 00:39:02,960
Scott: He was looking evil and casting evil Magic, you know his evil cause was purple so dark.

649
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:04,684
Rym: I like how he.

650
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:09,040
Scott: he wore black and lived in a castle where everything was black.

651
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,454
Rym: So here's where any hired guys who were slave really obviously starts to break down.

652
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:15,300
Rym: So he's pedophile.

653
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,119
Rym: I guess he acts like one talks like one looks like one.

654
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:22,760
Rym: He's kind of I don't remember exactly what happens.

655
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:31,128
Rym: but eventually the the heroes come to save everybody and He gets his head cut off or his hand cut off I don't remember.

656
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:37,296
Rym: and then Suddenly turns into a blob and he grabs the girl and runs away super fast as a blob.

657
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:42,660
Rym: and once he gets a little bit Away, he turns back into a slow old man and starts hobbling away like one mile an hour.

658
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:49,583
Scott: That is one thing that I've noticed in a lot of Ghibli movies, right is they really love to draw Anything?

659
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:54,380
Scott: that's sort of liquidy and swarmy even if it's not a Hayao Miyazaki movie, right?

660
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,035
Scott: Like beginning of Princess Mononoke the whole big wormy covered warthog beast, right.

661
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:08,911
Scott: and then you've got in Spirited away, you've got when the things are all splashing down in the crazy bathtub right the big black ooze thing that comes comes in.

662
00:40:08,952 --> 00:40:10,157
Scott: they have to wash it right.

663
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:17,127
Scott: and then in Ponyo, there's all the water is always going Right all over the place.

664
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:19,978
Scott: and is there a movie in the middle that I was missing?

665
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:22,245
Scott: Oh How's moving castle?

666
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:24,094
Scott: I guess sort of had it.

667
00:40:24,234 --> 00:40:26,744
Scott: I can't remember a specific scene Okay, but you know.

668
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:34,896
Scott: and then the black in this movie the guy turns into like a black slime and is all But only runs like a hundred feet with that.

669
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:35,500
Rym: then he turns back.

670
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,126
Scott: But I'm saying the Ghibli.

671
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:39,617
Scott: people love to draw that for some reason even better.

672
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:40,380
Rym: So they're chasing him.

673
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:46,685
Rym: He climbs up a tower So the main character chases him and they get to the top of the tower and they're gonna have their Great.

674
00:40:46,706 --> 00:40:52,167
Scott: when the stairs he was climbing got crushed But there just happened to be two platforms just like a video game.

675
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:54,196
Scott: that happens to not be crushed so he could make the jump.

676
00:40:54,337 --> 00:41:02,079
Rym: and then when they get to the Top and they're about to have their face off the bad guy just goes Around the corner and climbs up another flight of stairs and then they have the face off there.

677
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:03,483
Rym: Why?

678
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:07,652
Rym: And why does he kill Tara?

679
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:09,000
Scott: Why did it take so long to get up there?

680
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,379
Rym: By making his arm turn all blobby and muscly around her.

681
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:16,890
Rym: Yeah, like what was up with that?

682
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:19,340
Scott: just go stab or something?

683
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:19,814
Scott: I don't know.

684
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,712
Rym: I I'm at a loss to tell you what happened in this.

685
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:27,924
Scott: when you have the up the stairs chase You're supposed to have action like a guy throwing rocks at the other guy You know, there was.

686
00:41:28,245 --> 00:41:29,209
Scott: where was the action?

687
00:41:29,229 --> 00:41:31,580
Scott: there was no action scene choreography whatsoever.

688
00:41:31,882 --> 00:41:33,434
Rym: It didn't matter because they did the top.

689
00:41:33,495 --> 00:41:34,180
Rym: nothing happened.

690
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:38,519
Rym: It didn't matter what was going to happen because she was a dragon and she's just gonna kill him.

691
00:41:39,183 --> 00:41:42,040
Rym: Yeah that there's nothing that could have stopped her from killing him.

692
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:53,220
Scott: It's really sad because you know the Earthsea books are so great and a good great movie great TV show great anime Adaptation great comic adaptation could be made of them easily, right?

693
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,560
Scott: It's not like some other fantasy novels where it's they're difficult to adapt.

694
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,876
Scott: These are pretty easy to adapt in my book.

695
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:03,900
Scott: in my mind Anyway, I can easily imagine it as an excellent movie that is faithful to the books.

696
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:13,520
Scott: However, we've had so far a TV miniseries that was horrendous and because of that TV miniseries This movie was delayed in its American release.

697
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:17,072
Scott: So this movie finally comes out in America when the you guessed.

698
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:22,875
Scott: the license for that TV miniseries That was so terrible is gone and it's also terrible.

699
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:23,900
Scott: What the fuck?

700
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,182
Scott: What the fuck.

701
00:42:25,563 --> 00:42:30,338
Rym: but this movie was terrible in an extra special way because it was boring as fuck.

702
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,827
Scott: one guy in the theater fell asleep and some other guy kicked.

703
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:42,094
Scott: him was like hey, I Was just at no point was I excited or caring.

704
00:42:42,195 --> 00:42:50,945
Rym: I was excited in the beginning Cuz our dragons fighting and then there's obviously this big political plot building and I'm thinking alright, maybe this isn't so bad Where's it gonna go this guy?

705
00:42:50,965 --> 00:42:52,854
Rym: I mean, it's still a Ghibli.

706
00:42:52,974 --> 00:42:53,758
Rym: It's got it up.

707
00:42:56,007 --> 00:43:04,540
Scott: What you did in my movie Dragon, I don't know why like why did they feel the need to like rewrite the whole thing?

708
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:09,197
Scott: Why didn't they just take the first book and turn it into a movie?

709
00:43:09,317 --> 00:43:10,440
Scott: Well, and that's it Alright.

710
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,769
Scott: So the thing is that has all.

711
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:25,354
Scott: that first book has all sorts of great Ghibli moments Like you go to the Isle of Roke and you got to enter you got to talk to the gatekeeper guy Right, and I mean, that's so awesome That's such a Ghibli kind of thing and then row it on the boat and the

712
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:30,834
Rym: end of the book That's like the Ghibli climax just already written ready to go.

713
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:32,620
Scott: Just you don't have to change shit.

714
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,465
Scott: Just take that book boom.

715
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:37,594
Scott: There's your screenplay and animate it and done.

716
00:43:37,654 --> 00:43:38,456
Scott: You don't even worse.

717
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:39,820
Rym: This wasn't just an adaptation.

718
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:47,336
Rym: It's kind of like Goro just stole like random bits from the movies Like Aaron just happens to have a shadow following him.

719
00:43:47,356 --> 00:43:48,220
Rym: That wasn't explained.

720
00:43:48,421 --> 00:43:53,556
Scott: It was also supposedly based on something else that like, you know, Hayao Miyazaki had written.

721
00:43:53,597 --> 00:44:02,080
Scott: so it's like he combined Four books that Ursula K Le Guin had written and then one thing his dad had written and mixed them together.

722
00:44:03,163 --> 00:44:03,727
Scott: poop came out.

723
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:07,087
Rym: I Was it's hard to say like.

724
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:08,291
Rym: I don't hate this movie.

725
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:09,295
Scott: Yeah, it's not like.

726
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,680
Scott: I hate it like oh, it's terrible.

727
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,323
Scott: Never said.

728
00:44:11,704 --> 00:44:15,057
Rym: it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen all the way to completion.

729
00:44:15,158 --> 00:44:16,262
Scott: It's just bad Just don't.

730
00:44:16,443 --> 00:44:18,570
Scott: and if I like oh god, it's the worst.

731
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:20,075
Scott: No, I hate this thing.

732
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,420
Scott: It can go die in a fire.

733
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:21,985
Scott: It's just like.

734
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:22,975
Scott: this is bad.

735
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:25,225
Scott: ignore Why does Aaron?

736
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:25,406
Scott: not?

737
00:44:25,446 --> 00:44:27,235
Scott: even the thing is it's not even funny bad.

738
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:28,140
Scott: Like where's the funny?

739
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,264
Rym: There's nothing to make fun of.

740
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,459
Scott: it's not like an MD geist where you can be like other than the penis sword.

741
00:44:34,462 --> 00:44:35,650
Scott: Yeah, the boob sword.

742
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,300
Rym: everyone called it something different But everyone laughed when the suit sort came out.

743
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:45,635
Scott: The thing is I really to be honest Emily told me the sword looks like boobs because in the hilt of the sword are too round.

744
00:44:45,675 --> 00:44:47,543
Rym: who nuts and then it comes off Like a penis.

745
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:48,628
Rym: there's a hands at the bottom.

746
00:44:48,649 --> 00:44:50,900
Scott: The thing is if Emily hadn't said anything.

747
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:53,611
Scott: I would not personally have noticed or thought it.

748
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:57,225
Scott: but she didn't sound like in any way that any other sword Say anything to me.

749
00:44:57,245 --> 00:45:02,407
Rym: she told me it was a boobs and my first thought was if you take the blade off of that It's just a dick.

750
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:04,340
Scott: Well, she told me it was a boob sword.

751
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,324
Scott: So that's why I noticed.

752
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:09,928
Scott: but no if no one said anything I would not have thought the sword in any way strange I don't know.

753
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:10,677
Rym: I thought it was a dick.

754
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:15,084
Scott: Well, I mean every sword is is phallic But I mean it was not.

755
00:45:15,405 --> 00:45:20,109
Scott: I would not have noticed anything's amiss about the design of the sword if she had not said it Was the boob sword.

756
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:22,464
Rym: so Is it just me?

757
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:26,496
Rym: or did notice no character of any actual motivation other than hair?

758
00:45:26,877 --> 00:45:27,780
Rym: the slave guy?

759
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:29,394
Rym: Yeah, he was the only one he's like.

760
00:45:29,414 --> 00:45:34,220
Scott: I'm evil But he was pretty much like a lot of the movie was just stolen from Nausicaa.

761
00:45:34,421 --> 00:45:45,680
Scott: I like this lot of the clothing and character designs and he was straight up like totally based on those people who you know The the evil flying people from Lop to though the people that are flying men are no good, right?

762
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,680
Scott: I can't even remember which one of the ghibli movies.

763
00:45:48,741 --> 00:45:49,045
Scott: It was.

764
00:45:49,106 --> 00:45:57,408
Scott: they had the sort of people You know the the sort of group of of like four people who would fly around and we're not good But we're sort of like half good guys.

765
00:45:57,428 --> 00:45:58,854
Scott: Oh, what the hell it was that Lop.

766
00:45:58,875 --> 00:45:59,116
Scott: It's our.

767
00:45:59,156 --> 00:45:59,879
Scott: was it Nausicaa?

768
00:46:00,501 --> 00:46:01,083
Scott: I don't remember.

769
00:46:01,244 --> 00:46:02,227
Scott: you don't remember either do?

770
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:06,730
Rym: I'm reading the summary of the plot of the part that I fell asleep through and I Didn't miss much.

771
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:07,339
Scott: Okay?

772
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:08,923
Scott: But I mean, you know what?

773
00:46:08,943 --> 00:46:15,128
Scott: I'm you know, those people it's like there's a mom and like the the sons I guess and that's Lop to Scott.

774
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:15,991
Scott: Okay, Lop to yet.

775
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:20,164
Scott: He was totally a lot like those guys, you know Never turn good.

776
00:46:20,184 --> 00:46:20,746
Rym: He was just evil.

777
00:46:20,826 --> 00:46:23,596
Scott: I mean those people turn good and he didn't but another.

778
00:46:23,716 --> 00:46:26,409
Scott: but in all other respects He's sort of like the the minion.

779
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,102
Scott: He was also boring evil He's.

780
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:29,965
Rym: his character.

781
00:46:30,005 --> 00:46:32,092
Rym: motivation consisted of ha ha ha.

782
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:37,271
Rym: I am evil and a slaver and it's awesome That's it.

783
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:42,180
Rym: But like Ged his moat he just kind of wandered slowly and didn't really do anything.

784
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,366
Scott: I've only seen Lop to once.

785
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:44,653
Scott: I should probably watch that again.

786
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:54,020
Rym: Wow to Haru Basically is just pissy and then the very end is a dragon Mm-hmm and in between she has her moment when she rips the stake out of the ground and goes running.

787
00:46:54,682 --> 00:46:59,380
Rym: Yeah, but why didn't she rip it out like three hours ago if it was so easy to do?

788
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:12,314
Rym: And Aaron the main character has zero motivation and just kind of sits there until the very end of the movie when Terror shows up and says here's your sword that you had before and then lost.

789
00:47:12,555 --> 00:47:13,237
Scott: but that was that.

790
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:13,618
Scott: was that?

791
00:47:13,638 --> 00:47:15,925
Rym: was the other Him right or was no?

792
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:16,307
Rym: the other?

793
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:22,980
Rym: him told her to give the sword to the real him and then disappeared But didn't rejoin with him or anything.

794
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,300
Rym: He didn't even kind of follow the Earthsea book there and then suddenly he turned out of it filed there.

795
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:35,072
Rym: See what he turns into a Miyazaki hero and suddenly he's all badass and active and motivated when up until that point He had never been and nothing had changed.

796
00:47:35,555 --> 00:47:43,056
Rym: Mm-hmm I guess you could argue that because she knew his true name She spelled him into doing that but she was a total bitch to him before.

797
00:47:43,096 --> 00:47:46,000
Rym: and then suddenly she changed And there was no reason for that.

798
00:47:47,421 --> 00:47:51,000
Rym: The mommy character just kind of stood around being a mommy and never did anything.

799
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:54,112
Scott: Yeah, so I do want to wrap it up.

800
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:55,919
Rym: Oh you feel kind of bored with this.

801
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:57,999
Rym: We can't even make fun of it.

802
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,232
Rym: if this was like high-velocity wolf cannons, there'd be something to make fun of.

803
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:09,600
Rym: but this movie is just flat and Boring if you cut out every scene that does not directly advance the plot.

804
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:18,515
Rym: The movie literally is a 30-second clip of Someone standing on a roof turning into a dragon and killing an evil wizard the end man.

805
00:48:19,017 --> 00:48:20,080
Scott: There's a bad guy.

806
00:48:20,624 --> 00:48:21,026
Scott: We got it.

807
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:22,175
Rym: dragons kill him.

808
00:48:22,578 --> 00:48:27,293
Scott: Yes There aren't even like really interesting designs of anything the dragons.

809
00:48:27,373 --> 00:48:27,694
Rym: I liked.

810
00:48:27,734 --> 00:48:29,800
Rym: I liked how the sparks and shimmering were coming out.

811
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:35,552
Scott: I can't even like interesting creatures or interesting magic spell other than the dragons.

812
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,776
Scott: Yeah, everything was so tame.

813
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:41,379
Scott: I Guess the horse had an interesting design.

814
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:45,150
Rym: Yeah, the horse camel kind of a chocobo camel horse.

815
00:48:45,471 --> 00:48:46,415
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty cool.

816
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:47,719
Scott: I won't I'll take it.

817
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:50,232
Rym: But then again, why was it in the movie?

818
00:48:50,252 --> 00:48:51,739
Rym: And why did they do stuff with it?

819
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,683
Rym: But it didn't matter.

820
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:55,112
Rym: they kept like oh they saved it, but it doesn't matter.

821
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:55,894
Rym: Oh, here it is.

822
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:57,199
Rym: It's happy to see them.

823
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,403
Scott: great I'm a camel horse.

824
00:48:59,744 --> 00:49:02,855
Rym: Remember when Ged turns around with the ugly face and tricks hair.

825
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:04,260
Rym: Why was that scene even there?

826
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,379
Scott: There's a funny scene.

827
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:08,673
Rym: Why did he even bother having him lose the sword and get it back again.

828
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:10,380
Rym: that had no effect on the plot at all.

829
00:49:10,641 --> 00:49:12,689
Rym: Cuz Ged just went and got the sword like right away.

830
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:17,449
Rym: Yeah, he's went to the pawn shop guy and bought it And they introduced that whole.

831
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,947
Scott: I guess in sort of it's in some ways You could view it as a people.

832
00:49:20,987 --> 00:49:23,300
Scott: just do the smart thing movie, which is what we want, right?

833
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,411
Scott: It's like oh you lost the sword.

834
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:25,219
Scott: All right, I'll go get it.

835
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,146
Rym: So did Tara know she was the thing.

836
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:35,420
Scott: the problem is is that it's also boring because even though it's an always do the smart thing movie There's never any serious conflict.

837
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:36,965
Rym: I would argue anyone.

838
00:49:37,026 --> 00:49:41,220
Rym: it is not a everyone does the smart thing movie because Ged doesn't do fucking anything.

839
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:44,500
Rym: No, he doesn't and Aaron doesn't do anything.

840
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,584
Scott: Well, that's another thing.

841
00:49:45,645 --> 00:49:46,388
Scott: is that right?

842
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:51,870
Scott: Ged is is supposed to be like, you know He's like the Gandalf of that world, right?

843
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:52,793
Scott: He is the number one.

844
00:49:52,914 --> 00:49:54,480
Rym: Wait, wait, is he the Archmage?

845
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:59,097
Scott: That was it as an example of a really bad dubbing part, right?

846
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:05,520
Scott: Someone says Archmage instead of Archmage But anyway, he's supposed to be the Gandalf of that world.

847
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:14,200
Scott: He is serious business and after the like the first book he you know Isn't really the focus even when he you know, he's in it all the time.

848
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:26,940
Scott: But like when he in the tombs of Atuan, he's sort of in the background They're mostly focusing on the girl who needs to be rescued from the tombs and then he sort of does the rescuing, you know He's sort of in the background character.

849
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:29,600
Scott: He's not ever focused on like that.

850
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:36,100
Scott: So the fact that you're already beyond the first book well beyond it, but you're focusing on him and it's it doesn't work.

851
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:37,666
Scott: That's not how it's supposed to be.

852
00:50:37,928 --> 00:50:40,840
Rym: It doesn't you know, well, why was Aaron the main character?

853
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,643
Rym: He didn't do anything.

854
00:50:41,703 --> 00:50:44,396
Scott: The movie was the main character was a third book.

855
00:50:44,457 --> 00:50:46,246
Rym: Yeah, but This movie.

856
00:50:46,587 --> 00:50:47,271
Rym: What did he do?

857
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,040
Scott: He did nothing nothing.

858
00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:49,783
Rym: We.

859
00:50:50,345 --> 00:51:03,420
Rym: this would have been such a good movie if they'd made to Harrow the main character and make the whole thing Leo Forget the kid or maybe he's there but he's a side character getting the kid come to her You know a little village and they disrupt and then she figures out that she's a dragon who saves the day.

860
00:51:03,642 --> 00:51:06,063
Rym: They could have made a really good movie There.

861
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:06,606
Scott: I did it.

862
00:51:06,626 --> 00:51:07,894
Scott: So, you know, it's a really good movie.

863
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:12,814
Scott: smarter than Goro Take the first Earthsea book and just read it and that's it.

864
00:51:12,995 --> 00:51:14,500
Scott: Don't put any other shit in there at all.

865
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:16,183
Rym: Maybe maybe anime.

866
00:51:16,224 --> 00:51:17,949
Scott: no touching no touching.

867
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:22,101
Scott: I Is.

868
00:51:22,483 --> 00:51:27,640
Scott: I heard that Miyazaki said something along the lines of I don't want to give my kids any help, right?

869
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,638
Scott: They got to make it on their own.

870
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:33,470
Rym: Well, they got to make it on their own Directing but he'll have all the animators they want.

871
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:34,193
Rym: Yeah, right.

872
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:35,980
Scott: It's like these Ghibli animators.

873
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:41,952
Scott: they're like some of the best animators in the world and He basically because this guy was Miyazaki son.

874
00:51:42,012 --> 00:51:54,658
Scott: Okay, maybe Miyazaki didn't help him direct but you know what he helped him by providing the team of the best animators in the world and Forcing them to draw really long boring slow scenes of a dude walking around.

875
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:58,740
Rym: really well It was animated beautifully, but nothing's like.

876
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:01,028
Scott: That is such a crime.

877
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:06,239
Scott: They could have been working on something else better But instead they were working on this that whole time.

878
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:12,560
Rym: What the fuck the movie won the bunsun raspberry award for worst movie in Japan?

879
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:18,240
Scott: Oh, and girl Miyazaki won worst director is definitely the worst studio thing studio Ghibli has ever made.

880
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:24,162
Rym: There is no question and it is in the list because remember I always say like something is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

881
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:28,016
Rym: I do not finish movies that are worse than a certain line.

882
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:33,435
Rym: the worst movie I have ever watched to completion was Clifford with Martin Short playing a 10 year old boy.

883
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:40,336
Rym: the second worst movie I've ever watched to completion completion was the movie that M Night Shyamalan wanted to make about Avatar.

884
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:41,660
Rym: had he not unfortunately died.

885
00:52:43,282 --> 00:52:45,633
Rym: This is in the top 10 of the worst movies.

886
00:52:45,714 --> 00:52:47,000
Rym: I've ever watched to completion?

887
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:47,845
Scott: I don't know.

888
00:52:47,885 --> 00:52:50,600
Scott: I mean you got to put things in there like great digital target.

889
00:52:51,103 --> 00:52:55,624
Scott: There's a lot but it's definitely like great digital target I can make fun of.

890
00:52:55,684 --> 00:52:57,770
Rym: there are things to say about it.

891
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,294
Rym: stuff happen in it.

892
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:01,460
Rym: I can make jokes about torsos climbing.

893
00:53:02,424 --> 00:53:07,207
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely lowest 50 definitely probably lowest 25.

894
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:11,800
Rym: maybe I can make some pedophile jokes about Lord Cobb because he is totally a pedophile.

895
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:13,555
Rym: Yeah, that's about it.

896
00:53:13,575 --> 00:53:15,717
Scott: That's it All right.

897
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,127
Scott: Don't don't spend money on it.

898
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:21,033
Scott: Don't even spend your time on.

899
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:21,594
Rym: I'll tell you why.

900
00:53:21,614 --> 00:53:24,683
Scott: maybe you should like if you can get it Just kind of skip through it.

901
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:32,869
