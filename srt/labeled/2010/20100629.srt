1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,358
Rym: It's Tuesday, June 29th.

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,120
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:12,743
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:14,670
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,423
Rym: Shock.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,318
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:36,529
Rym: So it seems like there's a big argument in the forum about the World Cup, but it seems like all the people from Europe are having a very different argument from the rest of us.

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,044
Scott: I don't know if we should talk about this on Tuesday.

9
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,450
Scott: Let's not talk about soccer balls.

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,554
Rym: But it's gaming.

11
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:44,202
Rym: I mean, sports are games.

12
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:45,910
Rym: We made a big deal about that in the early GeekNights.

13
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:49,650
Rym: Like, hey, someone who's into sports is no different from someone who's into Counter-Strike.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,534
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

15
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:52,870
Scott: I think we've done most of our sports show on Thursday, though.

16
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:54,641
Scott: So let's save it.

17
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:56,030
Scott: Let's talk about my balls instead.

18
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:58,230
Rym: As in your testicles, I'm assuming.

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:58,779
Scott: Yeah.

20
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:03,789
Rym: You know, this isn't unprecedented, so what do you got for me?

21
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:04,950
Scott: I don't know.

22
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:10,389
Scott: I was sitting at work today in front of my desk, and then suddenly the left ball was just like, "Hey, Scott.

23
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:10,669
Rym: Ow.".

24
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:11,198
Rym: Really?

25
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:11,709
Rym: The left one?

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,152
Scott: Yeah.

27
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:13,463
Scott: And then it said, "Eh, not ow

28
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:13,887
Scott: anymore.".

29
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:15,105
Scott: And then it said, "Ow

30
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:15,349
Scott: again.".

31
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:17,369
Rym: Are you sure you weren't sitting on it?

32
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,768
Scott: I checked that, yeah.

33
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,561
Rym: You weren't, like, askew?

34
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,349
Scott: I mean, sometimes- I checked that, too.

35
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,194
Rym: They'll kind of hang.

36
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:26,490
Rym: Like, if you have too tight of an inseam, they'll kind of hang to either side, and that's no good.

37
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,189
Scott: No, I checked it all out.

38
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:29,349
Scott: All right.

39
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,689
Scott: So I went on the internet, and it said, "If your nut hurts, you might have twisted nut, which means go to the hospital fucking now, or you're going to lose your

40
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:36,849
Scott: nut.".

41
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,370
Rym: Twisted nut sounds like perhaps the most horrifying thing that could ever happen.

42
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,195
Scott: You want me to get out?

43
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:40,759
Rym: Let me get the-.

44
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,909
Rym: I mean, I had a re-descended testicle once when I was in elementary school.

45
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:52,830
Rym: The actual- It punched me in the nuts, and I fell over, and almost passed out, and then I vomited, and then I had a- my testicle was up there.

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,220
Scott: The actual name is testicular torsion.

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,690
Scott: If you have testicular torsion, it's a medical emergency.

48
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,610
Scott: But apparently, it's a way, you know, if you have that, your nut's going to be hurting real bad, a lot.

49
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:07,450
Rym: Or, or- I know, it'd be in flames- Scott, there's another thing that could have happened.

50
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,686
Rym: Your nut- Oh my, wow, she's dead.

51
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:12,997
Scott: No.

52
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:13,768
Scott: I don't think so.

53
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,709
Rym: Your nut is already dead.

54
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:18,683
Scott: It could result in a bruise.

55
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:20,030
Scott: Maybe I bruised my nut.

56
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,109
Rym: Yeah, but you didn't bite today, did you?

57
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:23,649
Scott: I don't know.

58
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:25,050
Rym: You don't know if you biked?

59
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:25,667
Scott: No, I didn't.

60
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:25,919
Scott: Okay.

61
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,490
Scott: Because it was too warm, and also I woke up late.

62
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:28,990
Scott: Warm today?

63
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,510
Scott: And also, everything outside today smelled so bad.

64
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:46,330
Rym: Today, you know, I love New York City, and luckily, I avoided most of the sm- the only places that smell bad in my, like, commute, are right outside, like, Queensborough Station, and then, like, the hallway out of the 7 train in Grand Central.

65
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,189
Rym: It smelled like flowers everywhere else.

66
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,110
Scott: I don't know, 'cause the thing is, both ends of the subway were so smelly, and I didn't go anywhere else, right?

67
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,050
Scott: So even, even your living room smells, 'cause there's bad smells floating in through the window.

68
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,009
Rym: Yeah, thing is, it'll rain soon.

69
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:02,429
Scott: Uh, looks like it's starting to rain a little bit, but- It's gonna rain.

70
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,470
Scott: But I see the sun out there, so who knows- Can I have a sun shower?

71
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,770
Scott: But yeah, it- I hate it when it's hot, and it doesn't rain for a long time.

72
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,330
Scott: That's when the bad smells get really bad, because you're- the trash goes out there.

73
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,210
Scott: The trash gets evaporated and melts.

74
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:24,110
Scott: And you have melted trash, and that is- and everything, you know, the bacterias get to work faster, you know, before they get in the garbage truck, and it's just bad news all over.

75
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:34,850
Rym: So, this is actually really kind of big gaming news, though anyone who pays attention would know, but I know a lot of you kids just play new games, like Team Fortress 2, and Halo, I guess.

76
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,375
Rym: Counter-Strike, you know, one of the most popular, if not the most popular FPS in the history of gaming, was updated.

77
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:43,963
Rym: Like, actually updated.

78
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:45,229
Rym: They added stuff to it.

79
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,830
Scott: Yeah, they didn't just- they didn't just- you know, they've made a whole bunch of patches to it.

80
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,338
Scott: It's always been fully supported.

81
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:52,450
Scott: Like, if they found a bug in it, they would always fix it.

82
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,990
Scott: Yup, because- Even up to today.

83
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,550
Rym: I don't know how many of you realize that Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike Source- I mean, one, original Counter-Strike still has a surprising number of players.

84
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,269
Rym: Probably more than, uh, Tribes 2 does.

85
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:10,150
Rym: But, Counter-Strike Source is, to this day, as far as I can tell, one of the most played FPSs online.

86
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:17,230
Rym: I mean, you go to Team Fortress 2, and you look at the server list, and there's a lot of servers going on, but a lot of them are empty, a lot of them are achievement servers.

87
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,057
Rym: You want to play Counter-Strike?

88
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:21,410
Rym: There are a fuck ton of servers.

89
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,835
Scott: Yeah, you know, the original release of Counter-Strike, June 1999.

90
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:28,729
Scott: That's 11 years old.

91
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:33,010
Rym: And the thing is, Counter-Strike has mostly- there have been very few changes to it.

92
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:43,050
Rym: You know, it had its beta a long time ago, and I remember when they took the P90 out, as in- All the biggest changes happened in the betas in the very early 1.0 series, right?

93
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:43,275
Scott: Yup.

94
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,290
Scott: So, like, in the betas, they were changing it like crazy, putting the gun in, taking the gun out.

95
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,310
Scott: I remember- P90 hoses everyone down, P90 is normal.

96
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:58,607
Rym: The day they added that, it was, like, the best thing in the world, because I joined a server, like, later in the night, and everyone's like, "No P90s, no P90s, no P90s, so I bought a

97
00:04:58,627 --> 00:04:58,647
Rym: P90.".

98
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,570
Rym: And it basically was the God Machine.

99
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,410
Rym: I was like- I just walked around, and everybody died.

100
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,430
Scott: Yeah.

101
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:13,130
Scott: You know, and then, after, like, 1.0, 1.1, the biggest changes were map changes.

102
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,430
Scott: You know, they changed- you know, they added CS Thunder, they took out CS Thunder.

103
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:20,890
Scott: They added Dust2, they took out Estate, you know?

104
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:22,216
Rym: Well, I'm gonna save this.

105
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:25,010
Rym: I wanna make a whole thing of the day about the sad story of CS Thunder.

106
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,889
Scott: I mean, all- they basically took out all the maps I liked.

107
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:29,949
Rym: So, actually, there was a trap.

108
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,270
Scott: Like, Vegas and Estate.

109
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,089
Rym: Two days ago, I was playing Counter-Strike, right?

110
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,930
Scott: And what do I- Back alley, back alley.

111
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,510
Rym: What do I see in the map list?

112
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,668
Rym: Thunder.

113
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:39,566
Rym: And I'm like, "What the

114
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:39,950
Rym: fuck?".

115
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:41,677
Rym: But it was DE Thunder.

116
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:43,810
Rym: I didn't notice that right- I didn't notice that right away.

117
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:44,816
Rym: But I'm like, "Thunder!

118
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:45,119
Rym: Oh my

119
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,401
Rym: God!".

120
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:46,610
Rym: So I click on it, and I join.

121
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,310
Rym: It's some fucking, like, IC world style crap map.

122
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:51,607
Scott: Ah, fuck that guy.

123
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,389
Rym: That guy probably has no idea what he did to me.

124
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,370
Scott: That the equivalent feeling would be- He doesn't know that there's already a Thunder.

125
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:10,670
Rym: The equivalent feeling would be, way back in the day when I walked into, like, an EB, and there was a display that said "Tribes 2," and I walked over to it and picked up a box, and discovered that the box was in fact empty, and it was in fact a promotion for the games that was gonna come out in, like, a month.

126
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:12,309
Scott: No, you know what was inside that box?

127
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:12,964
Scott: Nothing.

128
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,108
Scott: A spring-loaded boot.

129
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,650
Rym: Spoiled dreams, broken promises.

130
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:17,657
Scott: Yeah.

131
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:18,450
Rym: Anyway.

132
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:20,210
Rym: But Counter-Strike was updated.

133
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,510
Rym: Now, no one saw this coming, except people who paid attention.

134
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,797
Rym: There was a beta for a while.

135
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,929
Rym: I actually joined the beta, and played it.

136
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:29,029
Rym: The beta of this new release.

137
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:36,805
Rym: But, when I first heard there was gonna be a Counter-Strike update, and the first thing I saw was, "We're adding over a hundred achievements,".

138
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:45,011
Rym: I was pretty sure that Valve was about to make the biggest mistake they could ever possibly make, and ruin Counter-Strike the way they ruined Team Fortress 2.

139
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:45,573
Scott: It's not true.

140
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:49,730
Rym: They added achievements, but they don't have any effect on the game at all.

141
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,969
Scott: Alright, so you can just ignore them.

142
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,849
Scott: You can ignore them.

143
00:06:52,010 --> 00:07:01,450
Rym: And the thing is, it might have a slight negative effect on the pubs, though, because you'll see players- No, I won't, because if some other player is trying to knife me in the back, he's getting a P90 in the face.

144
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,237
Scott: I guess that is true, right?

145
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:11,750
Scott: I guess Counter-Strike is a game that is constructed in such a way, whereas if you try to go for the achievement instead of going to win, you're just gonna get killed.

146
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:15,950
Scott: But, what if all your teammates are being stupid and trying to knife the other team in the back?

147
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:18,090
Scott: Well, then you lose, because your team is shit.

148
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,870
Scott: The thing is, Counter-Strike is one of those games- That happens anyway, so it's no change.

149
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,150
Rym: If you are good enough, you can single-handedly overcome an entire team of team-flashing jerks.

150
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:34,830
Rym: I'll admit, I still enjoy the occasional team-flash.

151
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,849
Rym: Especially if I'm, like, leading the team, like, I'm the good guy, like, everyone's listening to me.

152
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:43,648
Rym: And then, like, one round, I just team-flash and then team-kill someone, and they're like, "What the

153
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:43,949
Rym: fuck?".

154
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,562
Rym: And I'm like, "Sorry, my bad.

155
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:48,029
Rym: I didn't mean to do

156
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:48,150
Rym: that.".

157
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,029
Rym: They're like, "You didn't mean to team-flash and then shoot me in the head at the spawn

158
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:52,250
Rym: point?".

159
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:53,322
Rym: I'm like, "Yep, finger

160
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,585
Rym: slipped.".

161
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,580
Scott: But it was a single headshot with the deagle.

162
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,885
Scott: How is that a slip?

163
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:01,270
Scott: That's one lucky slip.

164
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:07,350
Rym: Nah, the last time I did that, I basically- I had a P90- not a P90, I stuck on the P90, I had the Para.

165
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:10,990
Rym: And I basically shot him in the head until he was dead and then stood over the body shooting.

166
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:17,590
Scott: According to Wikipedia, the system requirements for Counter-Strike are a 500 megahertz processor and 96 megabytes of RAM.

167
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,489
Rym: Man, no wonder none of you guys play Counter-Strike.

168
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:22,429
Scott: Who has 96 megabytes of RAM?

169
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,257
Rym: So, Firefox uses more than that.

170
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,805
Rym: So they added 144 achievements.

171
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,430
Rym: I keep getting them, I don't know what they are.

172
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,870
Rym: They added lifetime stats, which is gonna be real- I would give almost-.

173
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,210
Scott: Why couldn't I have that going back in history?

174
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:38,049
Scott: Why couldn't I have this from back when I was good?

175
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,130
Scott: Give me some retroactive lifetime stats.

176
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,847
Rym: I would kill- like, the CLQ, it was great to go into a website.

177
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:52,210
Scott: The thing is, I would have so many kills, but I would have so many more deaths, 'cause I always play Counter-Strike in sort of a kamikaze fashion.

178
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:52,651
Rym: Yep.

179
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:55,370
Rym: Scout's the one who has the MAC-10 and comes around the corner guns blazing.

180
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,564
Scott: I was like,

181
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:56,625
Scott: "Eh."

182
00:08:58,494 --> 00:08:59,347
Scott: Hold the button down, let's go.

183
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:03,020
Rym: They added tons of other, like, match stats.

184
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:05,470
Rym: Like, individual match stats, not just lifetime stats.

185
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:07,870
Scott: So basically, these are all the things that mods used to add.

186
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,175
Rym: Yeah, they have an MVP for each round.

187
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:13,985
Rym: It says what you did, like, "Rym killed eight terrorists with the

188
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:14,627
Rym: deagle.".

189
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:15,710
Rym: You know, that sort of thing.

190
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,924
Rym: They added a scoreboard with icons for players.

191
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:19,990
Rym: Your little icon is there.

192
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,190
Scott: Oh, can I choose my icon?

193
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:23,850
Rym: I think it uses your Steam icon.

194
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,410
Scott: Oh, okay, that's pretty good.

195
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:32,430
Rym: Also, they added a cinematic death camera that zooms out and shows you who killed you, what they killed you with, you know, more stuff that mods were doing.

196
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,990
Scott: Oh, 'cause the death cam was- they had one, but it wasn't that great.

197
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,772
Rym: No, now it's great.

198
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:42,150
Rym: They added the domination revenge system with the head in Team Fortress, which actually, it works pretty well.

199
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:42,969
Scott: What is it?

200
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:48,350
Rym: So, say I'm using the sniper rifle like the bitch-whore asshole jerk that I am.

201
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:48,769
Scott: Alright.

202
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:50,783
Rym: I use the auto-sniper all the time.

203
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:51,609
Rym: I'm that guy.

204
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,778
Rym: So say I killed the same guy, like, five times.

205
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,868
Rym: It is like, "Rym is dominating Penis Jerk

206
00:09:57,868 --> 00:09:58,471
Rym: 9!".

207
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:59,559
Scott: It doesn't actually do anything?

208
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,144
Scott: It just says it?

209
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:06,650
Rym: And now it flags us, so it flags him as dominated by me, and it flags me as dominating him.

210
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,228
Rym: But if he kills me, it's like, "Penis 9 got revenge on

211
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:11,549
Rym: Rym!".

212
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,030
Scott: So it's just a style thing?

213
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,969
Rym: Just a style thing.

214
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,170
Rym: But, like, it kinda adds the grudges to the game.

215
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:16,830
Scott: Okay.

216
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:17,913
Rym: And it does it pretty well.

217
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,666
Rym: And I'll admit, one achievement took me a little bit off guard.

218
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:22,690
Rym: I was kinda pleased by this.

219
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,418
Rym: So, I was camping, and we're playing a nuke.

220
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:28,910
Rym: And I'm camping, and there's a guy on the other side, and he's also camping.

221
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,577
Rym: And we're, like, way the fuck across.

222
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,144
Rym: Like, he's inside that little shack.

223
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:33,530
Rym: Inside of the building.

224
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,599
Rym: I'm inside the other building behind a crate.

225
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:38,926
Rym: And I'm zoomed in, and I see something.

226
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:39,408
Rym: I'm like, "Is that a

227
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:39,709
Rym: guy?".

228
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:43,210
Rym: And then I click, and someone died from a headshot.

229
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:51,230
Rym: And then I got this achievement that was basically killing an enemy sniper who was zoomed in on you with a sniper rifle that was zoomed in on him.

230
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:52,910
Scott: Alright.

231
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,195
Rym: And I was like,

232
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:53,582
Rym: "Alright!".

233
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:56,730
Rym: And basically, the point of this, they added a bunch of other stuff.

234
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,282
Rym: They did not change any fundamentals of the game.

235
00:11:00,624 --> 00:11:01,910
Rym: They just added polish.

236
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,695
Rym: They didn't ruin anything.

237
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,804
Rym: They didn't take out the AWP.

238
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,090
Rym: They didn't do any bullshit.

239
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,650
Rym: They just made an existing game incrementally better without actually changing the fundamental game.

240
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,510
Scott: My hat is off to you.

241
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:14,792
Scott: That's good.

242
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:18,230
Scott: I hope that, you know, I mean, obviously the achievements, they do cause a problem.

243
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,950
Scott: But it wasn't a problem that didn't already exist, which is on pub servers, people don't play for the team win.

244
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:24,356
Scott: So what do the achievements do?

245
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:27,710
Scott: Well, they're gonna make pub servers play even less for the team win.

246
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,829
Scott: I don't know if they will so much.

247
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,170
Scott: I mean, can you possibly play less for the team win than Counter-Strike players already?

248
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:40,450
Rym: Dude, you've already taken the bomb as a terrorist and thrown it behind a crate in the start, and are now hiding behind said crate with a parrot.

249
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:43,390
Scott: With a flash, and you're ready to team kill anyone who tries to come again.

250
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,572
Scott: Right?

251
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:50,390
Scott: So, you know, it's not making a problem worse, but if the problem didn't exist, it would create the problem.

252
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:58,990
Scott: And they haven't ruined the game, so it's the same Counter-Strike, but hopefully this will get some people to, you know, move back to Counter-Strike.

253
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,910
Rym: Oh yeah, and Counter-Strike now works on the Mac, which explains all the people who don't know how to play at all that have been flooding the pubs lately.

254
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,910
Scott: And they'll probably have really bad aim with their shitty mice.

255
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,013
Rym: Oh my god.

256
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,770
Rym: The only thing that would be better is if I could play against some kid on an Xbox.

257
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:15,509
Scott: Oh yeah, that'd be the best.

258
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,429
Rym: That'd be awesome.

259
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,350
Scott: It did, it came out for the original Xbox.

260
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,249
Rym: Imagine a sniper, you know, kind of pivoting slowly with his analog stick towards you.

261
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,718
Rym: I'd run around him in a circle.

262
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,589
Rym: I can run around him faster than he can scope.

263
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,410
Scott: I mean, he could push the flip 90 degree button.

264
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,843
Rym: Oh, so he flips 90 degrees.

265
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:33,450
Rym: I changed direction.

266
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:34,098
Scott: I mean 180 degrees.

267
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:38,470
Scott: But... Well, I mean, I mean...

268
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,249
Rym: Here's the real point of this news.

269
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:44,550
Rym: A lot of you out there complain, you know, Riven's got to only play the old games.

270
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,989
Rym: Everybody's only playing the old games.

271
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,290
Rym: Do you understand how crazily popular Counter-Strike is to this day?

272
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:50,989
Rym: There's a reason.

273
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,270
Rym: If you have never played Counter-Strike, you should try it out.

274
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,950
Rym: There's a reason it is so enduringly popular.

275
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:00,169
Rym: Any other gaming news?

276
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,427
Scott: Oh shit, gaming news.

277
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,168
Rym: Yeah, gaming news.

278
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:02,906
Scott: That was the news.

279
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:03,727
Scott: That was the news.

280
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:06,110
Scott: So, in the epic of...

281
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:06,764
Rym: In the epic...

282
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:08,010
Scott: So, okay.

283
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:08,490
Scott: What are you doing?

284
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,950
Scott: In the epic of Burning Wheel books, right?

285
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,769
Scott: They have Burning Wheel.

286
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,370
Scott: They got the character Burner, which is part of Burning Wheel.

287
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,070
Scott: It's the same thing.

288
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,650
Scott: They go together.

289
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,530
Scott: It just happens to be two separate physical books.

290
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:21,986
Scott: They had a monster Burner, which needs some updating, and there's some errata's on it because it's so old.

291
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:26,290
Scott: They got the magic Burner, right?

292
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:26,744
Scott: That's out.

293
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:31,023
Scott: And now, the summer secret surprise of 2010, the adventure Burner.

294
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:34,890
Scott: It's coming.

295
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,329
Scott: The pre-order already happened and ended immediately because they filled up.

296
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,050
Scott: But that's okay because you're going to be able to buy one just non-pre-order.

297
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,850
Scott: It's not something you have to pre-order to get.

298
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,010
Scott: It's just pre-order to get it signed and numbered and all that crap.

299
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,310
Rym: As long as they keep selling out, they're going to keep being printed.

300
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,110
Scott: So, you can just buy one when it's all good.

301
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:58,238
Scott: They only pre-order 200, but there's going to be thousands printed, so you'll be all set.

302
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:04,550
Scott: And this book, basically, what the adventure Burner is, is sort of a GM's guide, right?

303
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:07,090
Scott: It has a lot of advice for GM and commentary.

304
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,649
Scott: It's like the Talmud of Burning Wheel.

305
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:09,477
Scott: But also...

306
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:14,149
Rym: That's so apt.

307
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,710
Scott: But also, it has a bunch of adventures in it, right?

308
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,790
Scott: It has the sword and a few other adventures.

309
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,750
Scott: An updated version of the sword, mind you.

310
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:31,445
Scott: So, if you need to get started with Burning Wheel, this is probably... Everyone in your group should buy the regular books and then the GM should also buy this book.

311
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:39,290
Scott: And you can leave... And then, if the GM reads the adventure Burner, then he'll really have a good idea of how to get started and whatever.

312
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,128
Scott: And you won't need to go to the wiki and print stuff out or anything like that.

313
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,227
Scott: So, actually... And it's green.

314
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,070
Rym: For any of you listeners who... We talk about Burning Wheel a lot, who are interested but haven't played it.

315
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,342
Rym: Or the most common thing we get is people saying, "I want to play it, but I feel like I got to learn the system

316
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:54,768
Rym: better.".

317
00:14:54,991 --> 00:14:55,630
Rym: Some excuse like that.

318
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,748
Scott: You only have to read the first 75 pages of the brown book.

319
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,828
Rym: Just dive into it.

320
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:04,486
Rym: We've been getting more and more kind of success stories from listeners who say things like, "Yeah, I finally just played Burning Wheel and holy

321
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:04,748
Rym: shit.".

322
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,730
Rym: And then they tell us the crazy thing that happened in their first game.

323
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:17,718
Scott: The thing is, I must admit, those success stories come more often from people who play at a con versus people who just try it out on their own without having the experience or any reference.

324
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,510
Rym: Yeah, the con one-off is really the faster way to learn.

325
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,290
Scott: Because if you just go from the books, you won't fully grok just the words.

326
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,609
Scott: I mean, some people do.

327
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,769
Scott: But a lot of people, they don't fully grok just going on the books alone.

328
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,810
Rym: Especially if you're not an experienced role player.

329
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:40,129
Scott: And even if they have previous role-playing knowledge, their previous role-playing knowledge clouds their reading of the books.

330
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,850
Scott: And you really need to have that con experience.

331
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:45,610
Scott: It helps significantly.

332
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:47,526
Scott: But you only need it once.

333
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,824
Scott: You need it for a few minutes just to sort of be like,

334
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:50,369
Scott: "Oh.".

335
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,010
Scott: And then you'll read the book with the correct perspective.

336
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:02,430
Scott: Maybe getting some videos of proper play can help people get the con experience by proxy.

337
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:03,090
Rym: Huh.

338
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,190
Rym: I wonder if that's in the hopper.

339
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,327
Scott: No, maybe it's in the hopper.

340
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:15,240
Rym: So, things of the day.

341
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:16,620
Rym: I had to cop out a little bit.

342
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,397
Rym: I was trying to find a video of some awesome Counter-Strike griefing.

343
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,740
Rym: But people do play Counter-Strike, don't know how to make YouTube videos.

344
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,400
Scott: They're pretty busy playing Counter-Strike.

345
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,879
Rym: So instead, I've got this video of what the American food aisle looks like in a grocery store or somewhere else.

346
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,900
Rym: Because now in America, you go to your grocery store and they have the Hispanic food section and that Asian food section.

347
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,920
Rym: Apparently, Americans eat nothing but ketchup, mayonnaise, Swiss Miss.

348
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:48,018
Rym: This is pretty good.

349
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:48,913
Scott: Yeah.

350
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,620
Scott: It's chocolate barbecue stuff.

351
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:53,200
Scott: Maybe some apple pie.

352
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:53,960
Rym: And Swiss Miss.

353
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,139
Scott: Lots of chocolate.

354
00:16:56,261 --> 00:17:01,440
Scott: I think that what we should do is we should go to ethnic food sections for other countries.

355
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,719
Scott: Because they'd probably be interested to see.

356
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:13,640
Scott: If we went to say, I don't know, if we took a picture of our Chinese food section where they've got soy sauce.

357
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,380
Rym: Here's the problem.

358
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:21,419
Rym: Usually, we need a Chinese person or someone who speaks Chinese to make the video and then show it to other Chinese friends.

359
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,259
Rym: If we make it, it's just some American's YouTube who's even going to be able to click on it.

360
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,270
Scott: Oh.

361
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:34,239
Rym: Maybe we should start a thing and get people to send us videos of the American food aisle in all their countries and then compile them together.

362
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:37,220
Scott: There's a whole bunch of things.

363
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,540
Scott: It's pretty much the show me my country in your country shtick, right?

364
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,558
Scott: It's like, I want to see you people try to... What do I sound like?

365
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,420
Scott: My favorite thing is people making fun of American accents.

366
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
Scott: Then I will say what Chinese sounds like.

367
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,639
Rym: Like at Oticon before where the Australian guy was like, you Americans really say your R's.

368
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,479
Scott: Like R. Hello there.

369
00:17:58,742 --> 00:17:58,828
Scott: Yeah.

370
00:17:59,520 --> 00:17:59,816
Rym: Metal gear.

371
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,118
Scott: Why shouldn't we?

372
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:02,880
Rym: It's pretty much the best.

373
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:06,320
Scott: I'm just going to remove the letter N. All right.

374
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,627
Scott: Ready?

375
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:10,677
Scott: When we go to the...

376
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:14,060
Rym: You're about to say a whole bunch of words that don't have N's in them.

377
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,519
Scott: Man, I really like to eat a bah-ah.

378
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,519
Rym: You sound like kind of an upper class twit in England.

379
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,598
Rym: Bah-ah.

380
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:20,886
Rym: Bah-ah.

381
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:23,175
Scott: Bah-ah.

382
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:23,520
Scott: Bah-ah.

383
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:24,780
Scott: Anyway.

384
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,080
Rym: So yeah, that's all I got.

385
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,920
Scott: So I saw this poster on Kotaku.

386
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:31,840
Scott: It's a big JPEG or whatever.

387
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,133
Scott: Basically, what it is, it's a poster that says how to beat Mario 3 in 11 minutes.

388
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:41,720
Scott: All the poster is, is it's basically a string of buttons.

389
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,960
Scott: It's like write up A, A write B, then A, A, A, A, A.

390
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:48,361
Rym: So wait, Mario 3?

391
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,280
Scott: Yeah, Mario 3.

392
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,316
Rym: So if you just want to beat it, it's basically getting the warp whistles and otherwise holding right and holding B.

393
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:58,020
Scott: Well, and hitting A. You hit an A pretty much a whole bunch of times.

394
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,738
Scott: And whenever he jumps on a bad guy, there's a second string that shows you all the bad guys he jumps on.

395
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,757
Rym: Ooh, I like that.

396
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,100
Scott: So it's, you know, and it even shows you like how to, you know, you have to push start on the menu and, you know, go select the first world.

397
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,228
Scott: You know, it starts out by saying push right and then push up and then push A to enter world 1-1.

398
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,360
Scott: So, you know, if you follow these instructions, you can beat the game.

399
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,999
Rym: See, what it doesn't give you is timestamps.

400
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:25,519
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

401
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:26,879
Rym: All right.

402
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,340
Rym: All right.

403
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,139
Rym: I guess we should do the meta moments.

404
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:29,615
Scott: Oh, shit.

405
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,160
Scott: Meta moment.

406
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,391
Scott: Yeah.

407
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,536
Rym: Oh, I forgot it.

408
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:35,220
Rym: The book club book is currently The Lies of Locke Lamora.

409
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:35,919
Rym: Scott picked it.

410
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,496
Rym: I'm reading it.

411
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,800
Scott: He's actually reading it.

412
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,439
Scott: Holy crap.

413
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:40,659
Rym: I read Cosmos like right away.

414
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,140
Scott: You said you weren't done with it yet until like the last minute.

415
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:44,409
Scott: Yeah.

416
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:45,820
Scott: All right.

417
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,300
Scott: Well, maybe if we're in continues to read quickly, then we can do book club more often.

418
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:51,919
Scott: Watch out.

419
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,120
Rym: The more quickly we finish it, the more I'll pick my book.

420
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:57,040
Rym: I'm leaning toward Thus Beggs Zarathustra.

421
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:57,959
Scott: That's not that long.

422
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,879
Scott: No, it really isn't.

423
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,240
Scott: I got that for free on my iBooks.

424
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,060
Scott: Uh-huh.

425
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:02,799
Scott: See, iBooks is all evil, but you know what?

426
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,920
Scott: There's some free Project Gutenberg books in there, so why not?

427
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:07,040
Scott: And it's free.

428
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,599
Scott: So who cares?

429
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:08,040
Rym: All right.

430
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,580
Rym: ConnectiCon is not this weekend, but next weekend.

431
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,920
Scott: No, I thought it was the weekend after that.

432
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,767
Rym: No, July 9th, 10th.

433
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:15,499
Scott: Oh, fuck.

434
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:15,797
Scott: Yeah.

435
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:16,939
Rym: Time's a con.

436
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,479
Rym: Time's slipping.

437
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:18,583
Rym: Yes.

438
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,720
Rym: I'm sending the final addendum schedule to print tonight.

439
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,320
Scott: I'm going to have to prepare my panel that needs preparing this weekend.

440
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,920
Rym: Oh, do you want to reveal what the panel is?

441
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,860
Rym: It's in the schedule, so it's not like you can hide it.

442
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,340
Scott: I mean, I'm just... You know, we're doing a lot of panels, right?

443
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:34,439
Scott: I want to go over our panels, since it's so soon.

444
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,070
Scott: Oh, god.

445
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,310
Rym: We're doing anime.

446
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,857
Rym: you should see.

447
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,380
Rym: I don't remember offhand.

448
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,455
Rym: We're doing a lot of management of panels, like Bite Size.

449
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:44,357
Rym: Anime is in there somewhere, Hatsune Miku.

450
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:44,956
Scott: Yeah.

451
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,558
Scott: I don't know.

452
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,380
Scott: Is there anything else in there?

453
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,859
Rym: I think we're doing our gaming panels too.

454
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:48,260
Rym: I forget.

455
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:48,999
Scott: All right, whatever.

456
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,060
Scott: We got a lot of panels going on because we're running them, so we just gave them to ourselves.

457
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,959
Rym: There's a lot of front row crew panels too, like Beer Beer and Uncle Yo.

458
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,512
Scott: Yep.

459
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:57,931
Rym: Yeah.

460
00:20:58,622 --> 00:20:58,919
Scott: All right.

461
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,540
Scott: So, ConnectiCon is in Hartford, Connecticut.

462
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,358
Scott: It'll be exciting.

463
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:01,700
Rym: Yep.

464
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,600
Rym: Other cons are coming up, but we don't have a lot of announcements about those yet.

465
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:12,379
Rym: You should probably look into getting your plane tickets for PAX and your hotels and your pre-regs, because it'll sell out.

466
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,279
Scott: We're talking about West.

467
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,540
Scott: Yeah.

468
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:13,775
Rym: PAX.

469
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,438
Rym: PAX Prime, because it's going to sell out.

470
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:16,440
Scott: Yep.

471
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,160
Scott: Also, we've talked about this before.

472
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,640
Scott: The New York Comic-Con and New York anime festival have combined into a megacon of Doom.

473
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,580
Rym: Not to be confused with megacon.

474
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,300
Scott: No, but it's a megacon, literally, an ubercon of Doom.

475
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,660
Rym: Only, I don't think megacon would qualify as a megacon.

476
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,900
Scott: Not to be confused with ubercon.

477
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:35,440
Scott: Anyway.

478
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,160
Rym: Which is even smaller than megacon.

479
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:37,732
Scott: Yes.

480
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,488
Scott: Anyway, this con is October, I think, eight, nine, 10.

481
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:41,577
Scott: Yes.

482
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,080
Scott: But at the same weekend is 10, 10, 10, the Burning Wheel Con.

483
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,341
Rym: 10, 10, 10.

484
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:52,400
Scott: And a story in New York, because the original Burning Wheel came out in 5505.

485
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,900
Scott: So now on 10, 10, 10, they're having a Burning Wheel convention.

486
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,091
Rym: So if we use mod 12, then on 15, 15, 15, we'll have another one of these.

487
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,560
Scott: So we're going to try to hit up both somehow.

488
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,300
Scott: We have a lot of responsibilities, probably, at the New York Anime Comic-Con.

489
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,999
Rym: My suggestion to you, because there's a lot of awesome stuff going on at the New York Comic-Con, New York anime festival, a lot of gaming stuff, too.

490
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:18,880
Rym: I would go to the New York Comic-Con anime festival either one day, just Friday, or I would go Friday and Saturday.

491
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,180
Rym: And then someday the actual 10, 10, 10.

492
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,600
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is most of the action at the 10, 10, 10 is Friday and the Saturday.

493
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:32,020
Rym: So the optimal solution is to go to the New York Comic-Con anime festival on Friday, 10, 10, 10 on 10, 9, 10.

494
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,600
Scott: No, here's my suggestion, right?

495
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:44,939
Scott: If you are someone who really, you know, if your primary thing is you really want some role playing action, like, right, then you should go to the 10, 10, 10, probably Friday and Saturday.

496
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,597
Rym: Yeah, probably.

497
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:55,591
Scott: And then if you, your thing is you'll go to the New York Comic-Con anime festival, you know, mega giant con Sunday only, but you don't, you know, you're not that interested in it.

498
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,380
Scott: So you don't have to go to any events, just walk both floors.

499
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,299
Scott: And that'll be that.

500
00:22:59,446 --> 00:22:59,679
Scott: Right.

501
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:04,540
Scott: Whereas if you really, you know, the role playing is secondary to you, right?

502
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:14,060
Scott: What you should do is you should go to the Uber, mega, whatever con, right, Saturday and Sunday, when most of the, most of the big events are on those days.

503
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:19,240
Scott: And then if you go to the 10, 10, 10 on Friday, you know, that's, there's some stuff happening now.

504
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,100
Scott: Actually, I think the Friday is only a party.

505
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,020
Rym: That's what I'm saying.

506
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:26,100
Rym: Friday is the best day to go to the Uber mega.

507
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:26,680
Scott: Okay.

508
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:32,200
Scott: So Friday, no matter what, go to the mega Uber con and then it pretty much your decision is just Saturday, right?

509
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,560
Rym: Our goal.

510
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,880
Rym: We're probably going to do most of our stuff at this con because we're like, we've already got like scheduling happening and everything.

511
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,320
Rym: We're going to be at the New York Comic-Con, New York anime festival doing big stuff.

512
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,880
Scott: We're going to try to come to the 10, 10, 10, but if we go at all, it'll be on the Sunday.

513
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,059
Scott: You know, I'd really like to go.

514
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,040
Scott: Maybe we can do the stuff at the con like Friday and then isn't the party Friday night.

515
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,558
Scott: Maybe we can go.

516
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,096
Rym: Oh yeah.

517
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,540
Rym: Cause we don't need to be there late.

518
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:54,996
Scott: We'll see.

519
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:55,938
Rym: Well, we got to work out.

520
00:23:56,341 --> 00:23:57,640
Rym: Well, we might have to be there late.

521
00:23:58,163 --> 00:23:58,857
Rym: We don't do something.

522
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,560
Scott: We don't know when we're going to be there.

523
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:01,499
Scott: We had to figure it out.

524
00:24:01,861 --> 00:24:02,860
Rym: We might even be trying out.

525
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,560
Scott: We might even be like taxiing and subwaying back and forth.

526
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,360
Scott: Who knows?

527
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:07,992
Scott: I could see that.

528
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,393
Scott: We'll see.

529
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,380
Rym: We'll play it by ear, but we will let you know of our schedule.

530
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,480
Rym: Once we have it for both events and you'll have to pick what's more important to you.

531
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:22,119
Scott: But if you're in New York, especially if you don't live in New York, you can actually go back and forth on the same day.

532
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:22,859
Scott: No problem.

533
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,359
Rym: You should.

534
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,396
Rym: And in fact, they're not that far apart.

535
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,191
Rym: Where is 10, 10, 10 in Astoria?

536
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:28,320
Scott: somewhere in Astoria?

537
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,080
Rym: You know what?

538
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,000
Rym: The seven train pretty much goes almost directly there.

539
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,239
Scott: Well, no, you'd have to basically transfer to the end.

540
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,655
Scott: Well, no, you could go from the Javits to 34th street.

541
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:39,525
Rym: Oh, get on the indirect.

542
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:45,380
Scott: take on the NQ and or Q because the W is gone now and take the N or Q all the way there and then walk.

543
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,071
Scott: And that would be like 20 ish.

544
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,120
Scott: Well, plus the walking.

545
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:49,919
Scott: It might take you a half.

546
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:50,600
Rym: Actually, you know what?

547
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,600
Rym: Shared cabs might be the best bet because the cab can go straight over.

548
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,480
Rym: We're not going to get into this.

549
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:54,980
Rym: We're New Yorkers.

550
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,359
Rym: You'll figure it out on the weekend.

551
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,919
Scott: It'll probably take a half hour to make that trip.

552
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,560
Rym: I think that's all the matter we've got.

553
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,860
Rym: Everything else is in the hopper.

554
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,540
Scott: I'm sure we have some other meta that I can't remember.

555
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:03,820
Scott: Yeah.

556
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:10,419
Rym: We got big stuff coming for Pax Prime and Pax East and the next Pax Prime and the next Pax East and all that stuff.

557
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:10,915
Scott: Yep.

558
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:18,440
Rym: So we were at the New York NYC, you know, nerd event, the recess nerd NYC recess.

559
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,567
Scott: Yes.

560
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:19,940
Scott: It is a other weekend.

561
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:23,540
Scott: It is a semi annual sort of convention.

562
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,940
Scott: It's not really convention as much as it is a day of gaming.

563
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,940
Scott: They rent out a space.

564
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,640
Scott: Everyone pays 20 bucks, but you don't have to pay if you're running a game.

565
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,620
Scott: And then everyone just plays games for, you know, all day.

566
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,360
Rym: Yep.

567
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:45,420
Rym: It's a mixed bag because it's role playing games and board games and there's a lot of free gaming, but it's pretty much Russian roulette in terms of if you join a game, you don't know the game master, whether or not it's going to be a good game.

568
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:52,438
Scott: I mean, there's like this, this game descriptions and you sign up for games as a big line to sign up and this whole thing going on.

569
00:25:53,201 --> 00:26:00,520
Scott: But you know, we, uh, we had someone who really wanted us to play in their game in the afternoon and we played a game of thrones board game in the morning.

570
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,760
Scott: We don't need to talk about that as much.

571
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,940
Rym: I got to play it one more time before we talk about it.

572
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,959
Scott: Let's, let's save that.

573
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,197
Scott: But in the afternoon we played a role playing game and the person running it was the guy who made the game.

574
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:11,574
Rym: Yep.

575
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:12,957
Scott: What was his name again?

576
00:26:14,162 --> 00:26:16,919
Rym: It was either Ben Lehman or Joshua A.C.

577
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:17,140
Rym: Newman.

578
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,917
Scott: Joshua A.C.

579
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,300
Scott: Newman.

580
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:18,650
Rym: Yeah.

581
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:27,280
Scott: Anyway, we played his RPG, which is called shock, social science fiction, social, social science fiction.

582
00:26:27,842 --> 00:26:28,897
Rym: So what's up?

583
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,771
Scott: You are shock.

584
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:46,380
Rym: So before we talk about how shock works, because I'll say this, this is a game that I think we're going to add to the list of games at the end of beyond dungeons and dragons whenever we run it again, because it illustrates a couple of things that all the other games don't illustrate.

585
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,900
Rym: For one, it illustrates the GM list game, the game that requires no game master whatsoever.

586
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:52,520
Scott: Yeah.

587
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:52,721
Scott: It's like.

588
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:56,139
Scott: I didn't even realize it as we, cause he was basically teaching us how to play his game.

589
00:26:56,961 --> 00:27:00,920
Scott: And then after we actually started playing, I was like, oh, there's no GM.

590
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,840
Scott: I didn't even realize.

591
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:03,978
Scott: He has no more power than me.

592
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,479
Scott: Didn't even realize it until we actually got into it that he wasn't actually going to GM this game, that we were just going to go for it.

593
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,540
Rym: And two novel mechanics of all the novel mechanics.

594
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:14,640
Rym: This is the one that will stand out like this.

595
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,500
Rym: If you were going to tweet about this game, this is what you would tweet.

596
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:28,500
Rym: You basically decide as a group, like in the court, like when you're making the world you're going to play in, here are the two like opposite sets of ways of resolving conflict.

597
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,000
Rym: So we made one that was consumption versus creation.

598
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:38,880
Rym: So any conflict that went in that side, you'd basically have to either frame your conflict in terms of you consuming or you creating.

599
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:41,100
Scott: And you're going to be, you can't be good at both.

600
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,739
Scott: You have to be better at one than the other.

601
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,359
Rym: And then you also have to frame what you're doing in that context.

602
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,839
Scott: You could be in the middle, but then you basically suck at everything.

603
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:48,939
Rym: Which think about that.

604
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,020
Rym: So having deciding what means of conflict you will have kind of frames the debate.

605
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,140
Rym: It frames what your game is going to be about.

606
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,679
Rym: Kind of like how the innate rules of like burning wheel frame the game as being about duels of wits and punching, you know, all that sort of stuff.

607
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:14,719
Rym: But the set of conflicts that we came up with first, the ones that, that kind of stood out, you could resolve a conflict with either space battle or sex.

608
00:28:15,603 --> 00:28:17,719
Scott: Well, it was originally space battle and something else.

609
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:24,259
Rym: And then we, this second set, every time we tell the story, you always interrupt and say, Oh, this whole backstory of like how we got to that.

610
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:27,960
Rym: I think just the revelation of space battle versus sex is all that matters.

611
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,640
Scott: Can't be leaving out important details.

612
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,439
Scott: It wasn't that important.

613
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:31,260
Scott: It was important.

614
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,059
Rym: What's important about it.

615
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,392
Rym: Go on.

616
00:28:33,822 --> 00:28:35,859
Scott: It's important because it's, it's how it went down.

617
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:36,400
Scott: Right.

618
00:28:36,804 --> 00:28:38,140
Scott: So space battle and something else.

619
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:38,599
Scott: Right.

620
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:41,900
Scott: And then we were like, okay, space battle and something.

621
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:43,379
Scott: And then what's the other one going to be?

622
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,460
Scott: Well, sex and something.

623
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:45,800
Scott: And I was like, wait a minute.

624
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:49,100
Scott: Why can't it just be space battle and sex together?

625
00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:50,579
Scott: And everyone was like, Oh shit.

626
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,719
Scott: And then that was actually what we did.

627
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:54,060
Scott: It was like, Holy crap.

628
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,460
Rym: Space battle got used a lot more than sex did.

629
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:56,729
Scott: Yeah.

630
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,778
Scott: There wasn't too much sex.

631
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,840
Rym: Well, the sex didn't get made because someone rolled well.

632
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,840
Scott: What upset me the most about that, right?

633
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,460
Scott: Wasn't that, I mean, space battle versus sex is awesome.

634
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:11,300
Scott: What wasn't awesome is that I couldn't be good at space battles and sex.

635
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:12,459
Rym: You were playing Harlock.

636
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,120
Scott: So he was good at space battles and sex.

637
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:16,379
Scott: He's good at both those things.

638
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:16,800
Rym: Yeah.

639
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,639
Rym: This might sound silly, but really think about it.

640
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:26,339
Rym: So, you know, the idea was that you have to frame the conflict in terms of like your characters achieving what he wants through space battle or through sex.

641
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:44,260
Rym: Cause the whole idea was the intimate conflict versus the distant, like massive space battle, the impersonal, you know, fleet on fleet action or like one guy and one other guy sweating alone, I guess a girl, but actually neither the way our game went.

642
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:44,840
Scott: Yeah.

643
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:54,440
Rym: So the real, the real shtick of this game is that every player kind of, you know, you sit down and you make the world and then you play a game in the world.

644
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,980
Scott: There's no, there's no predefined campaign setting.

645
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,738
Scott: This is a makeup.

646
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:05,360
Scott: You know, it's not, it's, it's not even a situation like dread where the GM makes some questionnaires and then the questionnaires define part of the world.

647
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:08,080
Scott: But then the answers to the questions define the rest of the world and the characters.

648
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,020
Scott: This is, you start with nothing, right?

649
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:18,239
Scott: And every player, you know, picks some thing they want to be in the world and that's what makes the world, uh, you know, exist.

650
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,520
Scott: You start from nothing.

651
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:33,120
Scott: I guess burning empires sort of does the same thing and as like charts where you build the world when you're starting, you know, um, and then after you have chosen what things you want to be in the world, you pick a shock and the shock is like the setting.

652
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,580
Scott: So our shock was what around we're in space in Jupiter, far away from earth, right?

653
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,638
Rym: Colonies and such.

654
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,360
Scott: So basically it turns into sort of like a battleship kind of situation down the left side of this grid.

655
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:58,717
Scott: You have all the different aspects of the world and then how they interact with the shock as it, they cross it, you know, on the other axis, that's a little logic puzzles in the, uh, that you get in those little, you know, puzzly dude,

656
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:03,319
Rym: the poison, but the poison killed Sue, but Sue was in the attic and you figure out who killed who at the end.

657
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:03,587
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,536
Scott: What room was Joey?

659
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:05,397
Rym: Yup.

660
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:12,539
Rym: But the cool thing is the way this works is every, every player brings to the table one issue and everyone gets to bring one.

661
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:20,080
Rym: So I brought in like foreign containment policy and this guy was like piracy and then someone else was like gender roles.

662
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,139
Scott: Like to point out, you tried to be fancy with a containment policy that didn't really come into play ever.

663
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:24,860
Rym: Yeah, it did.

664
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:33,299
Rym: I, my military containment policy worked really well anyway, though I died, but everyone, everyone brings something to the table.

665
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,118
Rym: But then every player takes ownership of one of the ideas, probably not the one they brought to the table.

666
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,040
Scott: You know, the one you own isn't necessarily the one that you came up with.

667
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,200
Scott: So I own the gender role thing.

668
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,460
Scott: I didn't own piracy.

669
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,620
Scott: Someone else owned the piracy.

670
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,119
Scott: And when you own an issue, that means that you define everything there is about that issue in the world.

671
00:31:54,301 --> 00:32:00,140
Scott: So someone just came up with piracy, but the other guy actually detailed what the deal was with piracy.

672
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:06,440
Scott: You know, pretty much the only thing that I said was piracy and all the other details are made up by the owner of piracy.

673
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,600
Scott: And there's really no disputing, you know, an issue concerning piracy.

674
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:13,539
Scott: You know, the owner just declares what it's going to be.

675
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:15,760
Scott: So this is why you need no GM, right?

676
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,879
Scott: Because, you know, a GM will tell you what's going on in the world, how piracy works, how gender works in this world.

677
00:32:22,322 --> 00:32:25,140
Scott: But instead you just sort of divide up the GM and duty.

678
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,200
Rym: So someone's still jamming.

679
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,311
Rym: Yeah.

680
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,800
Rym: It's like distributed game mastering.

681
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:28,379
Scott: Yeah.

682
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:34,299
Scott: It's like, OK, you define how the monsters work and you define how the traps work and you define how the weather works.

683
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:38,720
Scott: And then we'll be able to sort of collectively GM this world together.

684
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:40,899
Rym: Now, someone also owns the shock.

685
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:44,199
Rym: And if we play multiple games, you keep adding shocks.

686
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:53,539
Scott: But I didn't read all the rules because we just he just taught us to play and we played and everyone looked at the rule book shorter than, you know, I mean, I guess I looked at it, but I didn't read any words in it.

687
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:57,758
Scott: I wonder if you have multiple shocks at once, because we in a demo game, we just had one shock and that was it.

688
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:58,999
Rym: But like I own the shock.

689
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,439
Rym: So we sat down, you know, in the game creation, I had an index card and I wrote down like stuff about the world.

690
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,139
Rym: And I was like, all right, like, you know, he's like, are you on the shock?

691
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:08,860
Rym: Tell me about, you know, us living around Jupiter.

692
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,880
Rym: And I'm like, OK, there's one big colony and there's all these little colony.

693
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,239
Rym: And I can't just I made up the world.

694
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:17,000
Rym: And then other people be like, wouldn't it be cool if it was like this?

695
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,840
Scott: I'm like, yeah, we can't dictate, but we can offer advice and suggestions.

696
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:22,760
Scott: And if they like that, they can incorporate it.

697
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,499
Rym: But the owner determines if the owner doesn't say something or if someone else brings forth an idea.

698
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,167
Rym: They basically need a second.

699
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:35,220
Rym: because if only one person brings up an idea and everyone else really doesn't have anything to say, clearly no one's really invested in the idea.

700
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,159
Rym: So it kind of falls flat.

701
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:40,919
Rym: But if two people are like, no, it should be that way, like it adds more weight to it.

702
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:43,360
Scott: It was collaborative storytelling.

703
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:43,898
Scott: Yeah.

704
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,356
Scott: Yes.

705
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:48,655
Rym: See, this rounds out our beyond D&D because it shows the like the game.

706
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:51,540
Rym: that's more collaborative and less like game mechanic.

707
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:51,872
Scott: Yeah.

708
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:56,578
Scott: Now, the last thing that was interesting about this game shock, right, is that is a turn taking RPG.

709
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,651
Scott: I'm starting to really like the turn taking.

710
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:00,340
Rym: our mouse guard does it really well.

711
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:10,279
Rym: Well, Mouse Guard has GM turned player turn, but actually it also modifies that with the fact that the players have to earn their checks during the game master's turn and they can only roll the dice if they earn checks.

712
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:10,998
Scott: That's correct.

713
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:14,120
Scott: But the Pronto Adventures is actually turn taking.

714
00:34:14,225 --> 00:34:14,580
Scott: It's okay.

715
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,460
Scott: Your turn to do a scene, your turn to do a scene.

716
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,898
Scott: You go around the table doing scenes.

717
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:20,137
Scott: And this is sort of the same thing, kind of.

718
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,659
Scott: Basically you go around the table and everyone actually has two characters, a protagonist and an antagonist.

719
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,380
Rym: And you have two shot sides of your sheets on the front shot side.

720
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,199
Rym: I keep like shooing everything today.

721
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:33,219
Rym: I have my character, the protagonist.

722
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:39,358
Rym: Now, every protagonist is for a particular issue, but it can't be the issue that you as the player own.

723
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:39,895
Scott: So.

724
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:40,418
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,639
Scott: So that's why I didn't own piracy, even though I added to the game, because my protagonist was for piracy.

726
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:45,976
Scott: Yep.

727
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,800
Rym: My protagonist was like foreign containment policy.

728
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:51,679
Rym: But the issue I own was economic force.

729
00:34:53,801 --> 00:35:02,700
Scott: So anyway, what happens is on somebody's turn, at least on the first turn, right, that you take as a protagonist, you say, what are you doing that day?

730
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,499
Scott: It's like, hey, what are you doing today?

731
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,560
Scott: And you say what you're doing that day.

732
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,299
Rym: So let's go through the first round of the game, because it actually, like all the examples of stuff came up.

733
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:21,877
Rym: So I was like, all right, you know, my protagonist for this force policy, I decided he is the leader, like he's the military leader of like the biggest and like the USA of this outer world.

734
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:30,500
Rym: So I'm like, all right, I am before the Senate because I decided, you know, my antagonist is the president, like the other side of the government, the civilian government.

735
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:31,758
Rym: And I'm like, all right.

736
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:38,779
Rym: And I am advocating that we launch a preemptive strike against this plant, like this one colony that has fallen to piracy.

737
00:35:40,183 --> 00:35:42,380
Rym: And I had all these goals and, you know, we're going to get all the mechanics.

738
00:35:42,763 --> 00:35:44,940
Rym: So, you know, the way we play the game is all right.

739
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,792
Rym: Everyone who's not involved in the scene just played like some senator or like some member of the press and like threw questions at me or just kind of.

740
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:54,377
Rym: they played a character and did whatever they want with it.

741
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:59,740
Rym: And meanwhile, the antagonist played the president and was like basically fighting against me.

742
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,860
Rym: And we argued and played the scene out for a bit.

743
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:03,178
Rym: And then eventually it came down to.

744
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,839
Rym: So what do you want to achieve?

745
00:36:05,242 --> 00:36:06,078
Rym: You know, burning wheel stop.

746
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:17,593
Rym: So I'm like, I want to achieve a media blackout and followed by that under the course of the media blackout, we fucking invade and colonize and conquer and fix this colony of all the pirates.

747
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,620
Scott: So when it's when it's your turn, you basically tell a little story about what you want to do and what you want to achieve.

748
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:33,219
Scott: And then your antagonist, the person sitting to your right or your left, your left comes and they, you know, come at you and try to fuck up whatever you were trying to do.

749
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,040
Rym: But they have to do it in an oblique way.

750
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:36,109
Rym: So the way it works is.

751
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:37,500
Rym: I stated my goal.

752
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:41,593
Rym: I'm going to divide my dice between attacking and defending basically different kinds of dice.

753
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,680
Rym: Again, forgetting the mechanics, my antagonist doesn't just fight against me directly.

754
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,860
Rym: He'll roll defense against what I wanted to achieve.

755
00:36:49,302 --> 00:36:51,719
Rym: He'll also have his own oblique goal.

756
00:36:52,601 --> 00:37:01,121
Scott: So like, let's say Rym is a soldier and he wants to, you know, defeat some enemies in a war.

757
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:01,604
Scott: Right.

758
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,040
Rym: So my role is pretty much do we win the battle or not?

759
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,280
Scott: Right.

760
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:17,120
Rym: So rims offense dice are win the battle, win the war and the antagonist defense dice are prevent Rym from winning the war zoom in and out as far it could go down to a fistfight or all the way out to like two civilizations, like one of them.

761
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,500
Scott: So then the antagonist comes up with something else.

762
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:21,680
Scott: He doesn't you know, it's not winning or losing.

763
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,560
Rym: So he might even be like the president orders an assassination of you to prevent this military coup that they see coming.

764
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:27,841
Rym: Yeah.

765
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:28,786
Scott: OK, so now the office.

766
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:31,160
Rym: now I'm like, oh shit, I got to defend against that.

767
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,923
Rym: I don't want to die.

768
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:38,040
Scott: The offense dice of the antagonist are for the assassination and the defense dice of Rimmer against the assassination.

769
00:37:38,141 --> 00:37:39,440
Scott: So maybe both things will happen.

770
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,979
Scott: Maybe neither one will happen.

771
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,657
Scott: Maybe one will happen and the other won't.

772
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,715
Rym: So say I lose one.

773
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:45,883
Rym: You know what?

774
00:37:45,943 --> 00:37:48,500
Rym: I lose my winning the war or I lose the other one.

775
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:49,945
Rym: I'll have these links.

776
00:37:50,086 --> 00:37:53,240
Rym: They're kind of like contacts like my daughter or my manliness.

777
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:54,900
Rym: And I could say, you know what?

778
00:37:55,301 --> 00:38:05,082
Rym: I want to reroll by risking this link, by risking some horrible complication come up with by the antagonist about this, like, oh, your daughter died in the battle, things like that.

779
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:07,819
Rym: And the antagonist can do the same thing with their links.

780
00:38:09,985 --> 00:38:11,519
Rym: And then you kind of play it all out.

781
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:15,782
Rym: And once we've rolled the dice, all the other people who aren't involved in the left rights.

782
00:38:15,822 --> 00:38:25,547
Scott: Yeah, because you're taking turns and only two people are going at a time, everyone else at the table just participates by throwing in like little dice, you know, one dice.

783
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:27,939
Rym: And whoever is the highest role at any moment can be like, you know what?

784
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:30,559
Rym: I'm going to tip it in favor of him getting what he wants.

785
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:36,960
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much just the audience votes on which way they like it to go, you know, based on what they're hearing from the people.

786
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:47,440
Scott: So you want to role play really well because you're trying to convince that you're going to entertain the audience and also convince them that the direction you're taking the story is the direction you want to go, that their dice will help you get your way.

787
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:54,819
Rym: And it's interesting meta, because sometimes the audience will push it toward what their own protagonist wants in an oblique way.

788
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:57,159
Rym: You know, they're metagaming and it works.

789
00:38:57,562 --> 00:39:01,383
Rym: And sometimes they'll say, you know what is totally fucking awesome if you get assassinated.

790
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:13,580
Scott: It's also, you know, what I like about it is that because all these guys are sort of separate, right, you don't really need to have the protagonist like meet up with each other at all, you know, or anything, be in a party or even know each other.

791
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,980
Scott: It's like all these separate stories of a world.

792
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:23,939
Scott: It's like it's almost like Hyperion, right, where you have for most of the book, you have all these separate characters in the same universe doing their separate things.

793
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,040
Scott: And then only at the end is it tied together.

794
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:28,420
Scott: But even in shock, it doesn't even need to be tied together.

795
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,620
Scott: So you actually get like more than one story instead of like this one cohesive story.

796
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,300
Scott: And it actually that a lot of the sci fi books are like quite like that.

797
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,680
Scott: Other role playing games don't really do a good job of telling that kind of story.

798
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:51,340
Rym: They also the stories all kind of link and like they still fit in the context because the issues and the and the shock are all the same in every character's story.

799
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:51,762
Rym: Yeah.

800
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:56,510
Rym: So everything kind of pulls together and you just keep going around until the story is resolved.

801
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:57,240
Scott: Yeah.

802
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,400
Scott: So, I mean, until one player can't be you can't be killed on the first go around.

803
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:01,926
Scott: Right.

804
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:03,140
Scott: Oh, you have a goal, by the way.

805
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,000
Scott: You just come up with a goal and that's what you're trying to get.

806
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,221
Scott: Yeah.

807
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:06,227
Rym: And you can be anything like.

808
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:10,680
Rym: my character's goal was the complete and total military subjugation of the entire Jupiter system.

809
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,466
Scott: Mine was a revolution because I loved the, you know, the the, you know, like Captain Harlock.

810
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:17,360
Rym: I love Nova.

811
00:40:17,742 --> 00:40:20,340
Scott: He loves Earth, but Earth is currently a piece of shit.

812
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:21,959
Scott: So he wants a revolution on Earth to fix it.

813
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,520
Scott: So Earth is not a piece of shit anymore.

814
00:40:24,384 --> 00:40:25,580
Scott: And I achieved that perfectly.

815
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,298
Scott: I was one hundred percent win.

816
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:27,902
Rym: Yep.

817
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,240
Rym: But the system like it made a good story.

818
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,339
Rym: It was really fun to play.

819
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:33,506
Scott: It didn't take that long.

820
00:40:33,566 --> 00:40:35,859
Scott: It didn't take a lot of preparation, but it didn't take.

821
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,728
Scott: it wasn't, you know, difficult to learn anything.

822
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:42,980
Rym: things that make it really fun are one because you go around and you can't kill anyone till the second time around.

823
00:40:43,562 --> 00:40:44,820
Rym: People fucking go out for blood.

824
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:54,424
Rym: So the first time around is like the setting up and then the next one around is like people die and everything like just accelerates to the end because on turn one you can't kill anyone.

825
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,320
Scott: So what you do is you basically give yourself a soft toss.

826
00:40:57,601 --> 00:40:57,882
Scott: Right.

827
00:40:58,103 --> 00:41:00,777
Scott: And then on turn two, you try to hit a home run every turn afterwards.

828
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,239
Scott: You try to hit a home run.

829
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:07,871
Rym: The antagonist, they basically, you know, they don't have a skill for rolling like you do because they play.

830
00:41:07,891 --> 00:41:08,860
Rym: They don't just play a character.

831
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,423
Rym: They play.

832
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:13,000
Rym: all the forces of the world are right against you, your protagonist.

833
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,321
Scott: Yep.

834
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:17,659
Rym: So they have like 14 or some number of dice for the whole game.

835
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,342
Scott: Period.

836
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:23,880
Rym: And they think they pick for each, you know, go around how many they'll roll.

837
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:25,520
Scott: They have a maximum of six, right?

838
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,123
Scott: Something like.

839
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:26,324
Scott: Yeah.

840
00:41:26,345 --> 00:41:28,840
Scott: So it's like, OK, I got in this whole game we're going to play.

841
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:29,530
Scott: I can have 14 dice.

842
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,120
Scott: So, OK, what's I'm trying to do?

843
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,047
Scott: Oh, he's trying to do this.

844
00:41:33,128 --> 00:41:34,639
Scott: Well, I only use three dice now.

845
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:36,680
Scott: Oh, he's trying to do something really awesome.

846
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,800
Scott: I'm using six, making sure that doesn't happen.

847
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,945
Scott: You know, fuck him.

848
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:41,980
Scott: OK, I better save him for later.

849
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,540
Scott: He's not doing something that big right now.

850
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:45,219
Scott: I'll let him get away with this real easy.

851
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,560
Scott: Oh, now I got to make it hard.

852
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,160
Scott: So the antagonist is really they have this difficulty meter and they can use the amount of the difficulty meter they want to use each time.

853
00:41:53,341 --> 00:41:57,022
Scott: And at the end of the game, they use eventually use the whole difficulty meter and that's they're done.

854
00:41:57,243 --> 00:42:09,076
Rym: Now, the other thing related to this that makes the game really, really fun is that because you play a protagonist and the antagonist, you kind of get to do all the stuff that you might have done in another role playing game, but you didn't.

855
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:10,940
Rym: because you didn't want to risk your character.

856
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:12,459
Rym: You kind of get to play.

857
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,980
Scott: Yeah, because I mean, I definitely I don't know if you're supposed to write like favor the protagonist or the antagonist.

858
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,020
Scott: I guess your protagonist has a goal which makes you favorite a little more.

859
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:26,384
Rym: I kind of used my antagonist to further the goals of my protagonist because I thought it was interesting that way.

860
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:31,240
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, my antagonist, I was basically just like, you really care about the antagonist.

861
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:40,300
Scott: I'm not invested in them because I didn't really, you know, so I was mostly just trying to, you know, use the rules with the antagonist, be as much of a dick as possible.

862
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:45,362
Scott: And, you know, really what you're forced to do right when you're a protagonist, you can fail if you want to.

863
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:53,060
Scott: When you're an antagonist, you're forced, you know, mechanically to come down as hard as possible on the person you're antagonizing.

864
00:42:53,602 --> 00:43:06,462
Rym: Now, the only, I guess, drawback I could see in this game, like the major one, and it's not necessarily a drawback, it's kind of like how burning a wheel really only works well if you're already kind of experienced in role playing, like it's kind of like the advanced tool.

865
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:09,740
Rym: Shock requires that you are pretty creative.

866
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,519
Rym: You don't know, you don't have to be a good storyteller.

867
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:18,402
Rym: It basically, if you were creative at all, it'll funnel your creativity into an awesome story.

868
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:32,780
Rym: But if you're like, if you have zero creativity, you'll sit there and they turn to you like, all right, you own like nuclear weapons as the shock, like, oh, shit, nuclear weapons or the policy of like mutually assured destruction.

869
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:34,560
Rym: Tell us about that in this world.

870
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,080
Rym: Like if you freeze there, you're going to have some trouble.

871
00:43:37,441 --> 00:43:38,109
Scott: I'm not freezing.

872
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:39,000
Scott: I'll tell you what, you know what?

873
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,240
Scott: Mutually assured destruction, it already happened.

874
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:41,884
Scott: And you know what?

875
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:44,720
Scott: We're there's still some people alive, but you know what?

876
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,586
Scott: There's still some news left.

877
00:43:45,646 --> 00:43:46,977
Scott: It could happen again easily.

878
00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:49,480
Scott: So and that would be pretty awesome.

879
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:49,962
Scott: Right.

880
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:51,131
Rym: So you've got to be able to.

881
00:43:51,151 --> 00:43:52,400
Rym: you got to be able to think on your feet.

882
00:43:52,942 --> 00:43:56,979
Rym: And be able to listen to someone else's cool idea and shit all over it.

883
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,980
Scott: And also lots of cool ideas and they all get to happen for awesomeness.

884
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,143
Rym: I will probably talk about this game again once we've played it on our own and read the rules.

885
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,219
Scott: Yeah, I got to order a coffee.

886
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,880
Rym: So this is all based on one playing.

887
00:44:09,543 --> 00:44:11,680
Scott: But there's also an expansion like Horizon something.

888
00:44:12,142 --> 00:44:12,406
Scott: Yeah.

889
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:13,259
Rym: Or Human Contact.

890
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:14,302
Scott: Yeah.

891
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:20,560
Scott: Anyway, the other the thing that I also like about this game a lot is that most RPGs require a lot of preparation.

892
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,559
Scott: Either a GM has to prepare or players had to prepare.

893
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:27,080
Scott: And there's like this huge like setup of some kind, right?

894
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:27,643
Scott: Like dread.

895
00:44:27,703 --> 00:44:31,767
Scott: Well, the GM has to come up with the questionnaire or use the pre-built one or and it takes a while.

896
00:44:31,787 --> 00:44:35,143
Scott: Everyone's just sitting there writing answers to questions or burning wheel.

897
00:44:35,183 --> 00:44:38,400
Scott: Everyone has to make characters, the GM has to cover the setting.

898
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:39,041
Scott: Right.

899
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:42,840
Scott: There's a lot to do before you can play in this game.

900
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:44,349
Scott: You don't need to prepare beforehand.

901
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:48,329
Scott: You can just be like a board game like, hey, let's shock because the preparation is part of the game.

902
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:50,580
Scott: and but the preparation isn't boring.

903
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,219
Scott: Sitting around rolling up characters, everyone gets drained.

904
00:44:53,802 --> 00:45:00,060
Rym: It's actually feels like you're playing as soon as you start building the world because we started having debate like gender issues, you know, like someone owned that issue.

905
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:00,784
Scott: And that was me.

906
00:45:01,025 --> 00:45:03,860
Rym: Yeah, but it really got really interesting, really quick.

907
00:45:03,921 --> 00:45:05,074
Rym: And everyone got invested.

908
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:05,500
Rym: It's a game.

909
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:12,942
Scott: Yeah, because you're collaborating in the preparation part, whereas I feel like when you're rolling up characters for D&D or burning wheel, there's less collaborating going on.

910
00:45:12,983 --> 00:45:14,240
Scott: You're picking your own life paths.

911
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,140
Scott: You're not, you know, telling you're not picking other people's life.

912
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,960
Rym: There should be more collaboration.

913
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:20,026
Rym: But that's just a minute.

914
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:23,083
Scott: We can come up with a system where everyone gets to pick everyone else's.

915
00:45:23,244 --> 00:45:25,120
Scott: You pick life paths in a shared way.

916
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:37,922
Rym: Well, that's the old classic like Dungeons and Dragons scenario where you tell a character to make like a 15th level awesome bad ass, give them all these rules, and then you take all their character sheets away, give them level one characters and say, these are your enemies.

917
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,379
Rym: I like that idea.

918
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,158
Rym: Of course, it really works best if the players don't know what's going on.

919
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,104
Scott: Yeah.

920
00:45:45,124 --> 00:45:46,520
Scott: Well, now they all know you just give it away.

921
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,201
Rym: Yeah.

922
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:48,207
Rym: Well, no, you got to get a trick.

923
00:45:48,227 --> 00:45:50,140
Scott: them like shock shock does it without trickery.

924
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:51,760
Scott: And it's also science fiction.

925
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,323
Scott: And you know what?

926
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:56,284
Scott: It's really hard science fiction role playing games that are good or few and far between.

927
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:56,546
Scott: Right.

928
00:45:56,606 --> 00:45:59,320
Rym: Most of them are just D&D with like lasers.

929
00:45:59,580 --> 00:45:59,962
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

930
00:45:59,982 --> 00:46:00,163
Scott: Like, you

931
00:46:00,183 --> 00:46:09,381
Rym: know, you don't notice how many sci fi quote unquote role playing games have melee combat being equally effective to all other forms of scientific combat, like

932
00:46:09,401 --> 00:46:17,618
Scott: space lasers or their sci fi RPGs, which means when you want to do spaceships, you stop and play a turn based strategy game of spaceships.

933
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:19,980
Scott: Yeah, it's not really that exciting.

934
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:21,568
Rym: So it was awesome.

935
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,360
Rym: And we'll talk about it again.

936
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:25,980
Rym: But I'd recommend if you're really into role playing, you check this shit out.

937
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:27,438
Scott: Yeah, I'm probably I'll get it.

938
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,300
Scott: And, you know, also free market is similar in this way.

939
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,880
Scott: You know, you can just whip it out anytime.

940
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,866
Scott: Just like, oh, let's play it.

941
00:46:33,108 --> 00:46:34,720
Scott: You know, you don't have to plan in advance.

942
00:46:35,181 --> 00:46:37,738
Scott: You don't have to be like, all right, everyone, come over to my house at one.

943
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,320
Scott: And we're going to play game for six hours.

944
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,043
Scott: Oh, my God.

945
00:46:41,163 --> 00:46:44,600
Scott: It only takes two or three, maybe four hours tops to play shock.

946
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:52,680
Rym: As an aside, we saw the final like what free market looks like, like the physical thing you get if you bought it as pictures on the Internet.

947
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:55,160
Rym: Yeah, but it is pretty substantial.

948
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:55,945
Rym: It is weighty.

949
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:56,691
Scott: Yeah, that is.

950
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:57,980
Scott: it's a hard game to run.

951
00:46:58,121 --> 00:46:58,888
Scott: I've played it once.

952
00:46:58,948 --> 00:47:00,280
Scott: I'm pretty confident that I could run it.

953
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,059
Scott: But it is also the kind of thing that you can just whip out.

954
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:08,260
Scott: The creation is a little less collaborative, but it's still all right.

955
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,364
Scott: So we will.

956
00:47:09,424 --> 00:47:12,580
Scott: we'll talk about free market once, you know, more than just me has played it.

957
00:47:13,185 --> 00:47:14,340
Scott: We get some more experience there.

958
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,359
Scott: And, you know, when the box shows up and such and such.

959
00:47:37,144 --> 00:47:39,260
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

960
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,440
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

961
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:49,820
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion, news and more.

962
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,740
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

963
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,500
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

965
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,300
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

966
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,440
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
