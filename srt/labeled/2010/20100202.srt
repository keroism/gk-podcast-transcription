1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,977
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, February 2nd.

2
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:12,698
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,004
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:17,249
Rym: We talk a bit about the nerd NYC recess.

5
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:22,078
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:27,196
Rym: So I got this brand new computer.

7
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:28,881
Rym: I can play pretty much any game.

8
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:30,848
Rym: I would ever wanted to play just perfectly.

9
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:36,230
Scott: really I have a computer that's like a year old or maybe and it can also play any game ever.

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,240
Rym: Yeah, shittily you get like 20 frames a second in Bioshock.

11
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:39,963
Rym: I watched you.

12
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:40,806
Scott: Not really.

13
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:44,059
Rym: Yeah, just fine It was unplayable on your PC.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,582
Rym: I tried it.

15
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:45,848
Scott: Yeah, you're just crazy.

16
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,899
Rym: Anyway, I've got this awesome PC.

17
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:49,462
Rym: It's all set.

18
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,170
Rym: What have I been playing for the last?

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,691
Rym: I don't know.

20
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,998
Rym: three days back man counter-strike.

21
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,522
Scott: It's might as well be pac-man.

22
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:58,030
Rym: Well, it is counter-strike source to be fair.

23
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:00,519
Scott: So it's pac-man.

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:14,583
Rym: miss pac-man The thing is I'm kind of happy that I'm doing really well at counter-strike like more so than I used to in the Source in my experience is much harder than regular counter-strike, but I'm doing the.

25
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:17,070
Rym: I'm doing better than I used to do in these games.

26
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:22,888
Rym: I don't know if it's the mouse It's the mouse or just the fact that I have a ping like I used to have at RIT.

27
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:25,015
Scott: again It's the mouse and the ping.

28
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,481
Rym: I think it's the mouse and the ping.

29
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:29,633
Rym: Yep, cuz I went back, you know at RIT It was like what's my ping?

30
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:33,164
Rym: I don't know six maybe seven if it's around 11.

31
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,247
Rym: I quit because fuck that.

32
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:40,688
Scott: Yep That's why my skills at FPS is greatly decreased when I left RIT cuz my pain greatly increased.

33
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:46,248
Rym: also We don't play every single day like we used to yeah multiple hours every single day.

34
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:47,072
Rym: Oh my god I remember.

35
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:48,138
Rym: I'd like come home from our.

36
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:49,022
Rym: I'd like from class.

37
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,410
Rym: You'd be at home playing tribes.

38
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:53,381
Rym: I just joined the game like an hour later.

39
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,364
Rym: You'd leave and go to class.

40
00:01:54,444 --> 00:01:55,408
Rym: I'd stay I'd keep playing.

41
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:56,010
Rym: you'd come home.

42
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,116
Rym: I just you know keep playing.

43
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:57,899
Rym: then I'd go to class.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,301
Rym: I come back.

45
00:01:58,342 --> 00:01:59,005
Rym: You're still playing.

46
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:04,353
Rym: Yep Stopped every now and then to like eat but I Eat it while playing.

47
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,137
Scott: Uh-huh.

48
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:08,110
Rym: Yeah, usually I'd make that kitsune ramen and then I'd eat it in my lap.

49
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,586
Scott: But I need some ramen.

50
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:09,889
Scott: you got me.

51
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:10,693
Scott: I got a ton.

52
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:14,549
Rym: I gotta take some but I get it all over my keyboard because I beat it.

53
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,920
Rym: But I'd be hungry, you know, I eat it too fast.

54
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,085
Scott: Just this weekend.

55
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,210
Scott: I dishwashed my keyboard.

56
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:22,321
Rym: Yeah, I can't really do that with my DOS keyboard.

57
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:23,105
Scott: It worked real nice.

58
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:23,507
Scott: It's now.

59
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:24,230
Scott: it's like super clean.

60
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,483
Scott: I got to do my one for home.

61
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:26,150
Scott: I did the work one.

62
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:31,025
Rym: I kind of want to take another DOS keyboard to work, but I think my co-workers would kill me.

63
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,630
Rym: Why click click click.

64
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,256
Scott: Just get the happy hacking keyboard.

65
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:36,239
Rym: I'm thinking about it.

66
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:38,285
Scott: We'll see if it's good for VIM.

67
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:41,516
Scott: cuz the escape key is so close But there's no numpad.

68
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:42,400
Scott: so you gotta get a numpad.

69
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,270
Rym: Yeah, you can get one of those like external numpad.

70
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,450
Rym: I got external numpads or the company that makes my awesome mouse.

71
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,609
Rym: They also make like dedicated gaming hand pads that I don't like those things that are shaped like a hand.

72
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:55,860
Rym: I don't know if they're actually shaped like a hand.

73
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,990
Rym: They're just kind of they've got buttons all over them.

74
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,079
Rym: They're like a button pad.

75
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,169
Scott: Yeah, I'm not I'm not a fan.

76
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:04,330
Rym: I figure hold out like a year and then I'll get an OLED one and I'll be all set forever.

77
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:05,679
Scott: Basically, I'm not a fan of it.

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,410
Scott: You know, I sort of changed my philosophy.

79
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,128
Scott: I'm not a fan of anything that's weird and custom because then when you're in a situation where you don't have it What are you gonna do?

80
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,673
Scott: right, so if you get used to playing like PC games with your weird hand thing and then you go to like some tournaments somewhere and Sure enough.

81
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,161
Scott: They don't have the weird hand thing.

82
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:23,609
Scott: Well, what are you gonna do with your regular hand?

83
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:28,449
Rym: The mouse I have at least gets around that the mouse holds all the configs in it.

84
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,085
Rym: Yeah, so no matter where I go no matter what I like that mouse.

85
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:31,910
Rym: It's so great.

86
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,530
Rym: I took me a long time to like configure it and tweak it and I'm still tweaking it.

87
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:38,010
Rym: I have a profile for every individual game and it's cool.

88
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,081
Rym: They have all these rules like alright in every game.

89
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:47,158
Rym: set the mouse sensitivity to zero Unmodified and then make all adjustments in this program.

90
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:50,909
Rym: set the windows sensitivity to this because this means zero.

91
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:53,363
Rym: So it's all 100% in the mouse.

92
00:03:55,072 --> 00:04:05,597
Rym: Mmm, of course that leads to some weird problems because Bioshock the mouse because the sensitivity is so low as far as Bioshock sees Basically doesn't work in the menu.

93
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:07,683
Rym: But once I start playing it's perfect.

94
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:09,790
Rym: That's because Bioshock's written shittily, I guess.

95
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:11,816
Scott: Yeah, there's stuff like.

96
00:04:11,857 --> 00:04:15,650
Scott: that is always weird with games like because not every game is programmed the exact same way.

97
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,459
Scott: Like my logitech mouse.

98
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:23,429
Scott: in the if you go to logitech settings There's a checkbox that says, you know, okay set some sense.

99
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:28,009
Scott: There's a sensitivity bar and then you can choose do you want to use this one or the windows one?

100
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,192
Scott: Right or both.

101
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:33,694
Scott: Yeah, and then there's a button that says okay when you start a game What do you want to do?

102
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:36,970
Scott: Do you want to use this sensitivity the game sensitivity the window sensitivity, right?

103
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,190
Scott: But it the detection of when you're running a game is not the greatest.

104
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:52,850
Scott: so sometimes it thinks you're playing a game when you're not and sometimes your thinks you're not playing a game when you are and Sometimes they'll get trapped like it'll know you started playing a game, but it won't know you stopped and your sensitivity is black.

105
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,790
Rym: So I remember I had a lot of problems.

106
00:04:55,871 --> 00:05:06,329
Rym: I made a custom thing because no one had a good one to actually Change between the sensitivity for a mouse and the sensitivity for a joystick inside of tribes - yeah tribes - could let you.

107
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,045
Scott: because basically, you know other games the you know the.

108
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:15,803
Scott: if you opened up the The terminal in the game the command prompt like in quake it was like a quick.

109
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:19,564
Scott: it's quick language, you know in Tribes, it was basically C++.

110
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:22,749
Rym: But I couldn't get that to work too.

111
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:33,770
Rym: Well, so I found an external app that was meant for all games any game that had vehicles and walking But it would pretty much hose my computer every time I stopped playing tribes and I'd have to reboot.

112
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:39,249
Rym: It says something about the priorities in my life that back then that the obvious solution was.

113
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,669
Rym: well I'll just reboot every time I finish playing a game.

114
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,802
Rym: Yeah, of course those days are back a little bit a little bit cuz.

115
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,790
Rym: I've been playing games like every day when I get home.

116
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,002
Scott: I've been playing Street Fighter 4 a lot.

117
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,965
Scott: Not every day though.

118
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:58,036
Scott: I haven't played it since last week So I played again probably tomorrow.

119
00:05:58,097 --> 00:05:59,221
Rym: What tier are you?

120
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:00,284
Rym: Are you top tier yet?

121
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,950
Scott: I'm on the lowest possible tier.

122
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:02,980
Rym: Can you check out of?

123
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:03,929
Rym: I don't even know I?

124
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,313
Scott: Well, I can.

125
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:10,890
Scott: I know that if someone throws me and I throw them at the same time Then it'll say technical and make a little blue swirly.

126
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:12,761
Rym: So what does that mean?

127
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:13,810
Rym: What's the gnosis there?

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,956
Scott: That means that you did basically you do the same thing as the other guy at the exact same time I hit him in the exact same spot.

129
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:21,187
Scott: then it basically like cancels.

130
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:37,214
Scott: It's like So if a guy's trying to throw you right you can't really block because you can throw someone who's blocking you can jump away from Them right, but then you're jumping away from them and maybe they'll like shoot a fireball real quick and you'll land on it And that'll hurt.

131
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:47,257
Scott: so if you know He's gonna throw You just push throw at the exact same time because you saw the throw coming a mile away and it'll make a blue swirly And then you're right next to him.

132
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:49,870
Scott: You didn't get thrown and then you can make a move, huh?

133
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:57,775
Rym: So you got any gaming news because I don't really have any gaming news other than the fact that Pax East is almost sold out.

134
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:01,650
Rym: There's only 600 tickets as of like four hours before we recorded this.

135
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,970
Scott: You know anime Boston is the week after Pax East, but we're not talking about it nearly enough.

136
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:08,630
Rym: Now we're going to anime Boston too, but none of you care because this is Tuesday night.

137
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,450
Scott: You know, there's gonna be gaming in anime Boston, too.

138
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,130
Scott: So, you know if you like anime even a little bit you should hang around the town all week.

139
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:18,495
Rym: Yeah, but me and Scott are gonna be around Boston even more awesome.

140
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:20,562
Rym: Yeah, anime Boston is gonna be pretty badass.

141
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:22,769
Rym: Of course, it sells out almost every year, doesn't it?

142
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:24,193
Scott: I think so.

143
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:24,936
Rym: Pretty sure it does.

144
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:25,839
Rym: It has big lines.

145
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,485
Rym: For all I know it's already sold out.

146
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:28,650
Scott: It deserves its big lines too.

147
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:34,510
Rym: So it does say one thing about Pax though, and you know, they've got Reed and everything behind the scenes But the Pax Hotel.

148
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:39,846
Rym: They got much better rates from the local hotels than anime Boston was able to get.

149
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:40,810
Scott: And they get free internets.

150
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,598
Rym: Yeah, that's the Pax policy.

151
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:44,767
Rym: If you stay in a Pax Hotel, free internet no matter what.

152
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,507
Scott: Yep And if the Pax Hotel doesn't do free internet, not a Pax Hotel.

153
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:48,989
Rym: Yep.

154
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:55,208
Scott: So yeah, I got a little bit of gaming news Dominion, very popular game lately.

155
00:07:55,228 --> 00:08:08,150
Rym: Yep Of course we had the problem that the game as fun as it was with the basic decks at least boiled down to Just make a money machine and then buy provinces or buy the witch and then make a money machine.

156
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:14,816
Scott: Basically every time we play Dominion a whole bunch with all sorts of combinations of cards from the regular set and from intrigue And all sorts of different people.

157
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:17,250
Rym: It wasn't just like a feedback loop like we've often run into.

158
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,919
Scott: Well, not all sorts of different people but enough different people.

159
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:33,360
Scott: and basically what happened is we determined that in order to win you should only buy like a handful of action cards and Get mostly money and then as soon as you have enough money buy all the provinces or buy duchies if you can't get provinces

160
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,900
Rym: Unless the game has too many attack cards and then you basically had to kind of go in for the long slog and buy duchies.

161
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:43,640
Scott: Yeah, but it was like a lot of cards were sort of useless.

162
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,812
Scott: Let you know like do you really need like the Chancellor or whatever?

163
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,740
Scott: Maybe not really, you know.

164
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,465
Scott: So whatever.

165
00:08:51,546 --> 00:09:04,417
Scott: so there was a seaside expansion that I knew existed but we hadn't gotten yet and I played it recently at a board game night a couple weeks ago and I played the seaside expansion and I'm playing right and I'm just.

166
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:05,220
Scott: I'm just like, you know what?

167
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,400
Scott: I looked around the all the ten cards because we played with all seaside cards, right?

168
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,789
Scott: And I looked at all the cards that were on the table and I picked one that I thought looked kind of interesting like the ghost Ship, which is which is sort of nice card.

169
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:22,850
Scott: So I'm like, okay, I'll get I'll just buy some ghost ships and Silver and gold and I'll be in this business, right?

170
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:34,207
Scott: So I bought the cars that sort of had obvious uses and You know, I started getting lots of money and I bought a province and the next turn I bought another province and I was like fuck.

171
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,090
Scott: Yes, that's right.

172
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:35,773
Scott: These morons.

173
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:37,900
Scott: They were buying action cars like nuts, right?

174
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,369
Scott: And another turn goes by.

175
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:43,383
Scott: I didn't get a province the next turn I didn't get a province.

176
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,159
Scott: again the turn after that this dude bought a province and a duchy on the same turn.

177
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:55,540
Rym: See I think what happened there is that it got the game got to the point to where there were enough Combos to where if you you can have this is only seaside cars.

178
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,754
Scott: This isn't have any Dominion or intrigue cards except for coppers and curses and we know whatever.

179
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:00,517
Rym: but think about it.

180
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:08,000
Rym: in the basic game It comes down to the fact that if you have eight money You should buy a province because that that's like just the way it works.

181
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,980
Rym: But you can't really build up enough momentum fast enough to do anything crazier.

182
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,459
Rym: There's no like late game because someone will end the game right away.

183
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:24,032
Scott: Yeah, so in seaside what they added was that some of the cards are orange and if a card is orange That means you play it and then it stays there and it does something next turn also.

184
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:29,820
Scott: So like the caravan you play it and You get plus one card plus one action.

185
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:40,238
Scott: So it's basically you know You just play them like crazy because you play one you draw a card you play another caravan you draw a card you play You play all your caravans that are in your hand and then the next turn.

186
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:45,060
Scott: If you let's say you played five caravans the next turn you start by drawing five cards.

187
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,459
Scott: So your turn begins with you having ten cards in your hand.

188
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:52,940
Scott: All right And there's a bunch of cards that basically they stick around for one turn and do something on the next turn.

189
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:55,640
Scott: One card that I thought was the most interesting was the Treasury.

190
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:57,043
Scott: I don't know.

191
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,453
Scott: I can't I don't have the specific exact wording of it.

192
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:04,532
Scott: Basically the way it works is You play it and it gives you some money, right?

193
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:15,812
Scott: And then if you Don't buy any victory cards right at the end of the then at the end of the turn all the treasuries that you played They don't go in the discard pile.

194
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:16,799
Scott: They go on top of the deck.

195
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:21,560
Scott: So basically what happens is if you have like five treasuries, they'll be on top of your deck.

196
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,498
Scott: You draw all five and I think they let you draw a card.

197
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:39,199
Scott: so then you're drawing five more cards and you basically have this pile of like ones that sits on top of your deck and you Keep redrawing them every single turn because they go right back to the top of the deck every time Until you eventually you buy a victory card, then they all get shuffled back in.

198
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:43,500
Scott: So it's like you can get six treasuries or even you don't even need six.

199
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,017
Scott: You just need like three treasuries and then draw three gold every turn.

200
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:50,529
Scott: and you buy gold Three monies and you buy gold.

201
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:56,280
Scott: you buy gold you buy gold you buy as many gold as you want You buy gold every turn and then eventually when you're satisfied you have enough gold.

202
00:11:56,702 --> 00:12:00,860
Scott: Let the treasuries get shuffled back in by a province by province by province by province.

203
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:06,807
Rym: Right, well what's interesting is the game kind of had stages and each expansion Gave us more.

204
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:11,193
Rym: gameplay like the original dominion was fun And then you know our group solved it and then there's more stuff.

205
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:12,619
Rym: and oh now we got to do different off.

206
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,655
Rym: now We solved it and then there's more saw.

207
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:15,320
Rym: now we solved it.

208
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:26,454
Scott: I want to get the seaside because the seaside makes the action cards just a little bit more powerful so that they're actually more Worthwhile than just buying silver and gold but as another dominion expansion that's coming out.

209
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:28,380
Scott: This is the news called alchemy.

210
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,920
Scott: I suspect it will involve turning things into other things.

211
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:33,604
Rym: I'm excited.

212
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:34,248
Rym: Dominion has.

213
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:42,400
Rym: every time I've started to Peter out and think yeah I'm kind of done with this game and expansion fixes every concern I have and makes the game brand new to me all over.

214
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,326
Scott: Yeah, what's kind of cool is?

215
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:46,504
Scott: it's like it's not collectible But you use.

216
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:49,320
Scott: they're still making big money off you because you're buying expansions.

217
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:52,240
Scott: But that's okay because it's not collectible, right?

218
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,860
Scott: I just buy the expansion and I'm done and I don't care if there's a hundred expansions or not because it's just you know.

219
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,173
Rym: But think of this already.

220
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:04,080
Rym: there are more Combinations than any human could ever play if they devoted their entire life from birth to death playing Dominion.

221
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,700
Scott: The thing is most of the combinations are the same.

222
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:06,821
Scott: It's.

223
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:12,520
Scott: you know, if I play with these nine cards and I switch one out It's depending on which one I switch out probably not making a big difference.

224
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:14,568
Rym: Well, it'll come down to.

225
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,117
Rym: does this game have the witch or not.

226
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:20,829
Scott: Yep So yeah, Dominion alchemy is coming.

227
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,419
Scott: Dominion seaside is good, you know.

228
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:28,463
Scott: Get all four sets mix them up have an awesome time Awesome.

229
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:31,040
Rym: So I got a couple of quick minor geek bites.

230
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:34,643
Rym: There's really nothing in the news that I cared that much about though There was that whole.

231
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:38,798
Rym: the prison won't let the prisoners play D&D anymore because they think it's gang related.

232
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,633
Scott: Whatever Yeah, and there probably is like a D&D prison gang or something.

233
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:43,436
Rym: That's kind of awesome.

234
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:46,075
Scott: I know I figure I just let those guys out.

235
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:46,640
Scott: I'd be like you're good.

236
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:49,880
Rym: I think I should email or I should just send a regular letter to that prisoner.

237
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,589
Rym: I mean that I found all the info on him.

238
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,856
Scott: Yeah, you can send letters to prison.

239
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:57,720
Rym: I should be like, hey Burning, can you send them books if I can burning wheel?

240
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:12,783
Rym: But I've been playing two games, you know I'm not gonna talk about counter-strike and I want to kind of get out my first impressions because they're games that I never actually Played before and I probably should have of course Psychonauts.

241
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:14,455
Rym: well for sideshow knobs.

242
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:20,740
Rym: It's like you That's that's one of those games that no one really knew about except the people who were like hardcore about it.

243
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,886
Scott: It's sort of like earthbound.

244
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:23,435
Scott: it's like there's a whole bunch of people who are like fuck.

245
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:24,869
Scott: Yeah Fuck.

246
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,341
Scott: Yeah But you know if you actually look around not that many, you know But it's.

247
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:29,542
Scott: it's.

248
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:33,197
Scott: it's one of those games of this like a loud internet voice for it and no other voice.

249
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:43,380
Rym: like no one I get the game that I'd always heard of my whole life, but until Yahtzee talked about it I didn't know anything about it other than there's a game called psychonauts that some of our friends won't shut the fuck up about.

250
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:48,076
Scott: Yeah, I mean I played it for a few levels, but that was about it.

251
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:50,142
Scott: I was not really Excited.

252
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:57,353
Rym: yeah, well the thing is it's one of those games that gets a thousand points for style kind of like Brutal legend, I don't know.

253
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,745
Scott: maybe it gets 500 points for style.

254
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:01,951
Rym: it gets not as many points as brutal legend.

255
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:05,300
Rym: brutal legend has the biggest disparity between style and gameplay.

256
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:06,604
Rym: Yeah, oh my god.

257
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:11,140
Rym: It pains me that brutal legend is not just a move is completely non brutal.

258
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:11,583
Scott: It should.

259
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:16,954
Rym: it should have just been an animated directed DVD movie Oh my god, or even just a live-action movie with Jack Black in it.

260
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:18,260
Scott: who knows whatever.

261
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:21,960
Rym: Maybe some Harryhausen eska puppets and claymation sure.

262
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:28,040
Rym: But anyway, I mean, I don't know the game has just enough dark humor and all that to where I really like the style

263
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:28,961
Scott: And I

264
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:35,294
Rym: don't know if it's because I haven't played a 3d platformer in a long time But it's it's filling in an itch that I've had for a long time.

265
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,460
Rym: That was wasn't scratched.

266
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,362
Scott: Yeah, the 3d platform That's the main.

267
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:50,640
Scott: the reason I never like finished the game is because the 3d platforming this of it is like not The greatest in my opinion, you know compared to say a mario 64 or mario galaxy or something like that.

268
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,743
Rym: That's my conundrum.

269
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:53,367
Rym: The last 3d platformer.

270
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:57,999
Rym: I played was mario 64 and then DS and I played halfway through sunshine.

271
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,284
Rym: I was kind of dropped it.

272
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,172
Rym: I never played galaxy.

273
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:03,220
Rym: I'm kind of behind on 3d platformers.

274
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,928
Rym: So I have a feeling that everything I'm getting out of the sideshow knots I'll get it a thousand times more over.

275
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:12,380
Rym: if I just play like a Nintendo 3d platformer then I won't care about the game anymore.

276
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,607
Rym: So yeah in the spirit of riding the smaller roller coasters before I ride the bigger ones I'm going to finish precise show knobs first.

277
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:24,340
Scott: Yeah when I played the site show knots I had already ridden the bigger rollercoaster.

278
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:29,640
Rym: Of course, we'll see a lot of people say that like once you get later in the game, there's weird and cool stuff.

279
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,392
Scott: Yeah, that's that's a go guy gar situation right there.

280
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:33,096
Scott: that I am NOT.

281
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:34,000
Rym: We'll see.

282
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,690
Rym: I'm gonna play your game kids and I tell you what.

283
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:42,594
Rym: if there is nothing surprising in this game I'm going to be very disappointed with every one of you who's?

284
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:43,900
Scott: I don't think I don't think anyone's lying.

285
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,674
Scott: I think there is something later in the game that's different but at least like the first three or so levels I played It was not there.

286
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:50,139
Scott: It was later.

287
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:54,113
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is people aren't gonna say, you know that like.

288
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:58,900
Scott: I don't doubt that the later episodes of go guy Gar good as good as people say, you know, I don't think they're lying.

289
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:01,698
Scott: I just think that it's you know, I got better things to do.

290
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,758
Scott: then You know go through a whole big show or skip a whole bunch of episodes and be confused.

291
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:07,319
Rym: Well, it's simple.

292
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:19,905
Rym: What if would Mario 3 be as good of a game if in order to get to the actual first level of Mario 3 You had to be hide lied No See angry video game.

293
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:20,528
Scott: nerd did highlight.

294
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:21,351
Rym: Oh my god.

295
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:23,260
Rym: I kind of want to play highlight again.

296
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:26,471
Scott: I want to basically make highlight only not crappy.

297
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:29,643
Rym: Yeah, but I'd like was by default It's crap.

298
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,660
Scott: All you have to do to make highlight not crappies play The Legend of Zelda?

299
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:38,005
Scott: Well, no, you just make highlight slower and actually make the sword come out just like Zelda But keep that same map and stuff.

300
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,660
Rym: So just make a Zelda see that has that map exactly.

301
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,840
Scott: But I like the way the highlight looks with the with the screens, you know.

302
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,320
Rym: And then I think you forget what is little mazes what it's like to actually play on that.

303
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:52,475
Scott: No, that's nuts because the game the controls are all fucked up.

304
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:55,366
Scott: you move around way too fast You can't tell when you're attacking and defending.

305
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:57,996
Scott: if you just fix the controls and attack or defend.

306
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:00,425
Scott: No, you got.

307
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:04,200
Scott: it actually has to be pressed once to attack once and you know what I'm talking about.

308
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:06,520
Scott: Yeah, if you change that part it would probably be alright.

309
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:14,080
Rym: But I feel like I'm gonna play psychonauts now Before I play other games that remind me why it's not the best game in the world.

310
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:22,316
Rym: But I start to understand why people were so obsessed with it for when it came out The camera was amazing compared to similar games.

311
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:23,440
Scott: Oh, that is true.

312
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:30,506
Rym: Is that the camera is great compared to any other game I can think of from any part of that era Mmm also.

313
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:32,553
Scott: remember though you're playing what I'm like steam, right?

314
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:32,975
Scott: Yeah.

315
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,560
Scott: Yeah a lot of people played this thing.

316
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,972
Scott: I'm like ps2 and such so it's it's a different experience.

317
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:38,754
Rym: Yeah, I know.

318
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,987
Rym: I mean I got my Xbox controller Screen HD.

319
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:43,075
Rym: Yeah, I got it right here.

320
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:51,593
Rym: All right in fact I'm hooking up my computer to my TV because it's on the other side of the room in the living room and I'm gonna use The wireless controller and I'm gonna play all these games on the TV.

321
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:52,155
Rym: Mm-hmm.

322
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:53,059
Rym: I'm excited about this.

323
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:55,635
Rym: He's got a run an HDMI cable right through that wall.

324
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:56,379
Rym: We'll see how that goes.

325
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,659
Scott: Good luck with it.

326
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:14,740
Rym: the other thing I'm playing is all those old total war games that my computer couldn't handle before because my fan of those I'm a fan so far but I feel like Everything that feels like it's strategic is actually just letting me win.

327
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:18,968
Scott: yeah, I mean I played the demo of like the first one ever when it was new.

328
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:24,640
Scott: right and Basically, the demo has you do the combat where you're controlling like these big armies and formations.

329
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:31,540
Scott: You got archers and pikemen and all sorts of stuff right out, but then right I actually watched someone play like for reals.

330
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:34,310
Rym: They just grab all the troops and send them straight in yet.

331
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,060
Scott: And and basically they never actually went into the combat.

332
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,799
Scott: They just play the game on the map and they just let the combat be like auto because that doesn't matter.

333
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:43,180
Rym: It gives me that option.

334
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:46,743
Rym: But I don't know that the whole point of the game is to learn like Formations.

335
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:50,376
Scott: right but that part doesn't matter because you just win if your army is the right size.

336
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:51,400
Scott: You just play the map game.

337
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:54,148
Scott: Yes, I'm playing just that's the reason that I was like.

338
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:57,940
Rym: well fuck that I'm playing just the actual combat apart.

339
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,400
Rym: I'm playing through all the historical things and the history is okay, and I feel like you can learn some stuff.

340
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,040
Rym: But so far, uh, you learn more from reading the Wikipedia article on infantry tactics than you do play in this game.

341
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:12,006
Rym: Yeah, so we'll see.

342
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:12,468
Rym: I'm gonna.

343
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:20,250
Rym: I'm gonna give it more of a go but the game is just not nearly as Interesting or strategic or tactical or anything is.

344
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,322
Rym: a lot of people have made it out to be because people can't tell when you Know.

345
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:24,472
Scott: you just put up the.

346
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:25,420
Scott: it's like security.

347
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:32,875
Scott: You just put up the illusion of security and people believe that there's a care where you know Regardless of whether that act whatever that is makes them more secure or not.

348
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:34,080
Scott: It's the same with strategy.

349
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,499
Scott: You just put something up that looks strategic and people believe you've made it more strategic whether you have or you haven't.

350
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,400
Rym: Yep, like I tried this one scenario a bunch of times and I realized there's guys on the wall.

351
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,382
Rym: So I sent archers in to basically pepper the walls where these other archers are to keep them away while my battering rams and ladders go up.

352
00:20:50,905 --> 00:21:08,891
Rym: and I tried with and without the archers over and over again and I'm pretty sure that the archers had zero effect at all because it just made more goons that got killed on the top And it's kind of just a glorified hard-to-control tower defense game Mmm, or tower offense but not impressed so far.

353
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,740
Rym: Give me another month and I'll say I'm not impressed again.

354
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,738
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

355
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:23,661
Rym: what do you got for me?

356
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:28,583
Scott: I got another funny webcomic I found called Scott meets Family Circus.

357
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:29,429
Scott: no relation to me.

358
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:50,810
Scott: This guy's name is Scott Gerdner and basically what he does is he has a little Tumblr blog and he makes a little comic and on the left side of the comic he puts up an actual Family Circus comic which I'm sure is probably illegal, but he's parodying but he's also reproducing, you know He's putting up the original and his parody together as opposed to just the parody.

359
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,950
Scott: So, I don't know if this falls into like a Garfield - Garfield situation or not.

360
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,090
Scott: But anyway on the right side, he puts a parody of that exact same comic.

361
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:06,338
Scott: so it's a pretty funny take on the Family Circus and I laughed at it and Rym also lulled.

362
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,622
Scott: so it's pretty good.

363
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:08,184
Scott: Check it out.

364
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:12,582
Rym: It's no John Hey But it's good.

365
00:22:12,603 --> 00:22:17,730
Rym: Hmm So my thing of the day is not gaming related, but it's just too cool to not talk about it.

366
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,055
Scott: I think it any wasn't gaming related.

367
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:20,059
Scott: You ever heard of Family Circus?

368
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,284
Scott: video game, of course.

369
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:22,750
Scott: Yeah, okay.

370
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:28,308
Rym: Anyway, I just I always think back to that Perry Bible Fellowship parody of Family Circus.

371
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:29,030
Scott: That's the best.

372
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:40,570
Rym: But Bill Watterson the the reclusive author of Kelvin and Hobbes Which to this day is regarded by most people is one of the greatest if not the greatest newspaper strip in the history of newspaper strips.

373
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:49,450
Rym: There's an interview with him online which might not seem that crazy until you realize that there really aren't interviews with him ever anywhere.

374
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:54,259
Rym: He and the thing is it's not like he's a hermit necessarily he just he's just normal guy.

375
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:59,807
Rym: his neighbors all respect his Anonymity and he just lives in his town and they do reporters ask about him.

376
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:01,235
Rym: They just say yeah I'm not gonna tell you.

377
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:08,890
Scott: so basically, you know, he's not like Like Steve Ditko who like won't appear, you know, this guy goes the grocery store and shit.

378
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,190
Scott: He just doesn't want to talk to anybody and it doesn't want to be bothered by fans.

379
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:22,290
Scott: He just wants to be able to live a normal life without you know Like a Hollywood situation or salesman or business people constantly body just wants to be able to live a normal life.

380
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:36,619
Rym: But what's really cool is that by and large not like a loner who hides away and doesn't talk to anybody, you know He's such a respected individual that the press and almost everyone involved has respected his Desire to remain mostly private.

381
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,828
Scott: and I haven't respected if people are trying to find him.

382
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:39,450
Scott: Oh, they just can't.

383
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:41,478
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

384
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:47,735
Scott: if you really want in the problem No, but the problem is if you try to if you try to go after him the wrong way You just won't get anywhere.

385
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:50,450
Scott: He just won't talk to you and it's like well, what did you get?

386
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,286
Scott: You got a picture of him walking down the street.

387
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:53,937
Scott: big deal Yeah, but there was.

388
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,150
Rym: you didn't get any videos of people like chasing him.

389
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:57,301
Rym: I'm sure if people try.

390
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:58,290
Rym: there were two videos of chasing.

391
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,666
Scott: I don't think that's gonna happen because then if you try to do that you could go to like jail.

392
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:03,570
Rym: now, it's okay.

393
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:10,255
Rym: It's fine to chase people with a microphone as long as you're not threatening them with the microphone Waving it over your head somehow.

394
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:14,550
Scott: I think that the local police in that area would have a disagreement regardless of what the law.

395
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:19,650
Rym: Maybe they just murdered anyone who went anywhere near him and buried the bodies.

396
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:21,677
Scott: Yeah, right next to cow.

397
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:23,750
Rym: Anyway, this article.

398
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:29,770
Rym: It's really cool to finally hear some of his thoughts on why Calvin and Hobbes was popular and what he was thinking in it.

399
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,856
Rym: It's about what you would expect but I'll note.

400
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:39,020
Rym: the picture of him in the article is a semi stock photo from 1986. they didn't take a picture of him.

401
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:40,426
Scott: He emailed him.

402
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,270
Scott: He didn't even go see him.

403
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:42,602
Scott: Yeah, I think so.

404
00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:43,470
Scott: How's he gonna get a picture?

405
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:44,411
Rym: I don't know.

406
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:47,259
Rym: Bob telephoto lens camp out Google Maps.

407
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,683
Scott: the thing that I the most.

408
00:24:48,864 --> 00:25:11,190
Scott: the other the only more recent thing I guess the second most recent thing I've seen in terms of trying to find him was a guy who like Ended up in like a diner in his town and he's pretty sure that he saw him in the back room At a table talking to someone like in the you know the dining room But he couldn't confirm or deny whether it was him or not and the people in the restaurant wouldn't help him out at all.

409
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,859
Scott: So and that was sort of like as far as he got.

410
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,220
Scott: Yeah.

411
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,083
Rym: I just thought it was cool.

412
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:15,645
Scott: Yep.

413
00:25:16,086 --> 00:25:22,609
Scott: So meta Minute is the off-forgotten meta minute metamucil.

414
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:27,080
Scott: No Okay, so what meta things do?

415
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,686
Rym: you're the one who reminded me to do it.

416
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:29,590
Rym: you got nothing to say.

417
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:30,836
Rym: What's all this?

418
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:32,163
Rym: What the fuck Scott?

419
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:33,350
Scott: Well, this Pax East.

420
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:36,090
Rym: Yeah, Pax East is probably already sold out.

421
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,490
Rym: But if you want to go to Pax you didn't pre-register and you're not going to pre-register right now.

422
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,276
Scott: You're done and there's anime Boston.

423
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:45,723
Rym: anime Boston might already be sold out.

424
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:46,325
Rym: I don't know.

425
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:47,890
Rym: you should go pre-register for that, too.

426
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:49,068
Rym: It's right after Pax.

427
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,446
Scott: There is the mocha the mocha arts festival the weekend after that right after anime Boston.

428
00:25:55,467 --> 00:26:00,022
Scott: Yep Do I was like what the one that's a week after that Nexus.

429
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:00,927
Rym: some atheist thing.

430
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:01,530
Rym: it's a ways off.

431
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,614
Scott: It's some skeptic thing.

432
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:03,698
Scott: I don't think it's an atheist thing.

433
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,606
Rym: Well, I think the two are hand-in-hand.

434
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:06,550
Scott: No, not necessarily.

435
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:10,641
Scott: There are a lot of people who believe in the jeebus, but also don't like fake medicine.

436
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:13,269
Rym: Yeah, but then they're not skeptical enough.

437
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,436
Scott: There Is I'm gonna update the website.

438
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:24,410
Scott: you're reaching soon with some stuff and Rym is still not doing any e-commerce.

439
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:27,483
Rym: Yeah, I'm having enough trouble with these new microphones in the new computer.

440
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,889
Scott: You could have done the e-commerce first.

441
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:33,530
Rym: Yeah, I could have but the old computer as I learned when I tried to boot it to put up a show.

442
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,961
Rym: We recorded and it didn't boot.

443
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:37,842
Rym: I Changed computers about the right time.

444
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:38,346
Scott: Uh-huh.

445
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,875
Scott: Sure Okay, that's good enough.

446
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:42,203
Scott: It's supposed to be a moment.

447
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:45,536
Scott: It's not supposed to be the meta hour Yep, nothing else.

448
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:46,961
Rym: And then that was there was a little bit.

449
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:51,558
Scott: I for someone who was so prepared to do the man I just want to start remembering you do it every time.

450
00:26:51,698 --> 00:27:02,230
Scott: Oh, oh the book club selection is still Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and you should read that first book only and the next Thursday show.

451
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,135
Scott: That's what it's gonna be.

452
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:05,530
Rym: Well, you're allowed to read the rest of them, but we're not gonna talk about.

453
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:15,604
Scott: Yeah, and if Rym doesn't read it by the next Thursday show, we're gonna do it anyway, and it's gonna be lulls Rym sucks, I'll do it from my memory of like 12 years ago.

454
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:16,848
Scott: Yeah, you should.

455
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:17,350
Scott: you should read it.

456
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,055
Scott: It only took me one night or two.

457
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:22,747
Rym: It's not a long book now and you know, you guys should read read.

458
00:27:23,983 --> 00:27:31,190
Rym: Yeah I Get the impression people don't read many of the books we're doing and I'm pretty sure most of the people that were looking point of Doing the book club is to make people read.

459
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:40,583
Rym: I'm pretty sure almost all of you who are looking forward to the next GeekNights' book club show on the hitchhiker's guide Are only looking forward to it because you already read the book a long time ago.

460
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:42,170
Scott: Yeah read again.

461
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:45,760
Scott: Yes, however, or for the first time over the weekend.

462
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:48,990
Rym: We went to the nerd NYC recess in Brooklyn.

463
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:50,215
Scott: yeah, I've been had.

464
00:27:50,235 --> 00:28:02,630
Scott: there's a group in New York City if you live in New York City called nerd NYC and They have all sorts of gaming meetups and they do it one They do a board game night at a coffee place once a month that I go that I've been going to like two months in.

465
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:10,650
Scott: They got some sort of Gotham Gaming Guild RPG meetup kind of thing you can and basically all this stuff is organized.

466
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,482
Scott: They have a PHP BB and all this stuff is organized there.

467
00:28:13,543 --> 00:28:20,630
Scott: So if you're looking for RPGs LARFs board games any kind of thing in New York City, they got it.

468
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:29,798
Scott: So they have this recess event that I think is you know somewhat, you know, once or maybe twice a year ish and It's not quite a gaming con.

469
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,834
Scott: however, it is not but it's not exactly a board gaming night either I'll put it this way.

470
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:37,685
Rym: It is not a gaming con, but it is bigger than several gaming cons I have been to.

471
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:44,312
Scott: yeah There were like a hundred something people there and it's two full days of gaming from like 11 in the morning to 11 at night Ish.

472
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:44,815
Rym: Yep.

473
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,490
Rym: We I will only went for one day and for two days.

474
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:56,577
Rym: But in general if you guys you know You always want us to do the GeekNights con and we're getting there where you know We got a lot of others probably gonna be pretty similar to that Basically a room full of tables.

475
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,328
Scott: hang out for a day, you know play games Yep.

476
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:09,258
Rym: But if you want that Desperately and you're not willing to wait for us to get to it and it's not at the top of my queue by any stretch If you go to these things, we're there.

477
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:14,422
Rym: you can just pretend it's a GeekNights event, even though it's not Yeah, there was a listener there said hi to us.

478
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:17,240
Rym: Yeah, there were a couple listeners I ran and I'm also you know, I'm starting to.

479
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,970
Scott: you know, like I've been going to these things.

480
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:24,710
Scott: So I sort of you know, I'm becoming some friendly with some of the repeat attendees, you know, I can recognize them.

481
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,553
Scott: They recognize me.

482
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:31,516
Scott: I know a few of their names, you know, I know who likes what games, you know There's some guys or it's like.

483
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,304
Scott: we know, you know, we're the sero guys.

484
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,469
Scott: We always played the sero.

485
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:36,417
Scott: We got things going on.

486
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:38,989
Scott: So it's it's a good group of people's there.

487
00:29:40,091 --> 00:29:40,231
Rym: Yep.

488
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:43,783
Rym: I mean the only big thing I did was play a paranoia game.

489
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:47,399
Rym: This is the third paranoia game I've played in my entire life.

490
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:57,890
Rym: Oh man as much as I love paranoia I'm not one to put forth the effort to run it because I have other things I want to run and Not that many people run it let alone.

491
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,937
Rym: Well, so I mean what.

492
00:29:59,957 --> 00:30:06,379
Rym: we had that LARP at RIT that we were both in like the tabletop paranoia LARP And I played it once halfway.

493
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,643
Scott: I mean, it wasn't a LARP.

494
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,228
Scott: It's just it's sort of a half LARP.

495
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:09,830
Scott: It's a LARP.

496
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:14,330
Rym: Well, I usually I call that a tabletop LARP where you're LARPing and that you're all first-person.

497
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:18,430
Rym: Yeah, and the rules are fast and loose, but you're still all sitting around a table.

498
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:20,056
Rym: It's just like instead of dice.

499
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:23,370
Scott: There are some physical elements involved like props.

500
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,300
Scott: It's basically a tabletop RPG with props.

501
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:30,470
Rym: Yep, but also drop some of the dice and Oftentimes people like in paranoia like zap.

502
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,792
Scott: They'll use the mechanic of if you want to shoot someone you yell like a gun at them and you go your finger guns And you go zap.

503
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:40,229
Rym: Yep, and then everyone goes zap all at once and if you don't immediately zap at someone you didn't shoot.

504
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:45,605
Rym: Whoever has the most finger bangs pointed at them dies.

505
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,350
Rym: I like that mechanic a lot.

506
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,330
Scott: It's a little bit of mafia mechanics there.

507
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,441
Scott: It is werewolf for those of you who are heathens.

508
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:53,250
Rym: the guy around the game was pretty awesome.

509
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:58,670
Rym: He ran just as well as Luke only without the tabletop LARP element with Morgan.

510
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:05,750
Rym: Yes, and the cool part is I ran it You know, I played in it and Emily played in it with me and she had never played paranoia before.

511
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,213
Scott: Did you have the soda now?

512
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:07,815
Scott: We didn't do this.

513
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:08,376
Scott: What the hell.

514
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:18,717
Rym: she didn't know anything about paranoia other than it's kind of Logan's runny and weird and Computer the colors nothing.

515
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:22,630
Scott: She didn't really didn't know about the computer and the colors of being happy communist or anything.

516
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,965
Rym: She pretty much knew all the stuff, you know from us.

517
00:31:25,005 --> 00:31:27,897
Rym: talking about the game She never read the books or played it or anything.

518
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:30,045
Rym: So so we started as blue.

519
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,896
Scott: We played as like oh shit I played anything but red.

520
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:33,880
Rym: It was great.

521
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,410
Rym: I gotta tell you I was yeah, you could do fucking crazy show.

522
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,490
Rym: Oh my god, we went into the fucking position equipment.

523
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:42,523
Rym: We went into R&D and I was like, I want exploding everything.

524
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:43,367
Rym: and they're like, here you go.

525
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:43,889
Rym: And here's a nuke.

526
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:45,761
Rym: Yeah that nuke.

527
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:47,190
Rym: we had a total party kill.

528
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:52,775
Rym: In fact, we had two total party kills because not only did the whole party die But because then the nuke went off.

529
00:31:53,236 --> 00:31:57,989
Rym: the computer NPC party that was sent to kill all of us was also killed.

530
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:01,330
Rym: nice But she had no idea was going on and we're blue.

531
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:04,750
Rym: So, you know I bust into the R&D department with all these reds and yellows.

532
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,096
Rym: I'm like, give me all your fucking shit.

533
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:08,727
Rym: and then I killed them all because they were clearly communists.

534
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:10,913
Rym: Of course It was great.

535
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:12,698
Rym: I love paranoia so much.

536
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:13,300
Scott: Let's see.

537
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,347
Scott: What game did I play Saturday?

538
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:16,490
Scott: I'm trying to even remember.

539
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:17,073
Rym: We played Dune.

540
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:17,334
Rym: that was it.

541
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:17,615
Rym: we came in.

542
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,981
Scott: we played Dune the board game.

543
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,943
Rym: Yeah, we played first, you know, I've done a whole show on.

544
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:24,150
Scott: so should we really discuss it again?

545
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,270
Rym: I got there before Scott got there.

546
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,001
Rym: So me Alex Jess and Emily are all there.

547
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:29,330
Rym: and you know, I had via plenty.

548
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:30,778
Rym: So we just played it with some guys.

549
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:36,827
Rym: All right the via plenty and then those two guys, you know We're talking to him like hey, you want to play Dune and they're like, what's Dune?

550
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:37,992
Rym: and we did the thing We always do.

551
00:32:38,032 --> 00:32:40,664
Rym: well Dune is an asymmetric, you know all the stuff that makes you go.

552
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,106
Rym: Holy shit.

553
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:41,869
Rym: I want to play that game.

554
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:48,169
Rym: So we all sat down and we played a full-on game of Dune all the way to the end.

555
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:50,082
Rym: I don't think we've only done that.

556
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,170
Rym: I think once before.

557
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,940
Rym: Yeah We always kind of stopped halfway through Or we don't have a full loadout or whatever.

558
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,218
Scott: trying to remember what I was playing while you were playing Paranoia because I was at the next table.

559
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:00,760
Scott: Oh, all right.

560
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,199
Scott: I was running my t and e. I ran t and e. That's what I was doing.

561
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,349
Rym: Didn't you also run doom?

562
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:14,890
Scott: No, they accidentally put my name on that but no But yeah, no, I ran a t and e. I taught some people to play t and e. there was one guy who was German.

563
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,881
Scott: He already started knew how to play so he sort of crushed it.

564
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,450
Scott: one guy was cool, but he didn't really.

565
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,476
Rym: He did not grok the fullness.

566
00:33:22,557 --> 00:33:23,740
Scott: Oh, he slowly he grok'd.

567
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:30,043
Scott: he grok'd more than that guy at anime Boston, but He didn't catch on until you know sort of halfway through.

568
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:36,910
Scott: the other guy sort of knew what was up But he was you know, he definitely had the potential but it was his first time playing so you couldn't beat the you know.

569
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:40,804
Scott: And then there was that guy's the second guy's girlfriend who was sort of like.

570
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:44,813
Scott: well, you know She just sort of she was like she you know She.

571
00:33:44,874 --> 00:33:52,557
Scott: I think she liked the game But she just sort of got tired of not being able to make progress or figuring out how to make progress and getting crushed By the guy who was good.

572
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:53,964
Scott: So she was just sort of like whatever.

573
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:54,768
Scott: Let's just get this over with.

574
00:33:55,631 --> 00:34:04,155
Rym: Yeah, one thing I can say about our Doona game though was that you know Normally you play at a con like this and if your game goes long and people have like another game They should be playing.

575
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,785
Rym: you can tell a lot of games.

576
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:06,710
Rym: You'll see people sitting around.

577
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,355
Rym: They're all antsy.

578
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,463
Rym: Like I just want this to end.

579
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:09,370
Rym: I want to go do something else.

580
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,958
Rym: This was not what I was bargaining for.

581
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:12,025
Rym: This wasn't as good as I thought.

582
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:12,770
Rym: whatever that is.

583
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,409
Scott: The problem is that I think a lot of gaming cons, right?

584
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:20,090
Scott: They do this game registration thing Which is where you got a at a certain time.

585
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:28,906
Scott: They open the registration and you got to sign up and say what game you're gonna play and then you have to start playing That game at that time and then you're in that game until it ends.

586
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:33,201
Scott: you've committed to it And you know, this is sort of a traditional gaming con thing.

587
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:38,478
Scott: all gaming cons are like this, you know But I think you just shouldn't do it at all.

588
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:40,185
Scott: Just have open gaming period.

589
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:41,088
Scott: don't have any.

590
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:47,449
Scott: you know If someone might want to schedule a game like say I'm running this at X o'clock, right?

591
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,400
Scott: But don't do registration just so.

592
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:52,290
Rym: how do you deal with the fact that all right, I'm running paranoia?

593
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:57,063
Rym: I mean you saw like a hundred everyone lined up way before the afternoon signups.

594
00:34:57,224 --> 00:35:02,125
Rym: The paranoia game was full at me Yep, and everyone behind me was like damn it.

595
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:03,090
Rym: I wanted to play paranoia.

596
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:08,290
Rym: So, what do you do when I schedule my paranoia game and there are 60 people standing there who want to play?

597
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:14,510
Scott: I think that what you do is you just have table and first first to sit down.

598
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,230
Rym: So the fat guy sits down at noon and just waits all day.

599
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:25,260
Scott: Or better yet, right the guy running the game just chooses who he wants to be in the game.

600
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:29,250
Scott: Because I think a lot of the times what happens especially with an RPG, right?

601
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:36,430
Scott: But the signups is that the person who signs up is the person who's you know The crazy guy who's gonna wait in the front of the line.

602
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:43,437
Scott: It was not necessarily gonna be the best at the game or have the best Resulting game experience in the RPG.

603
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:46,206
Scott: So you don't really want that guy in your RPG.

604
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,230
Scott: He's gonna make it less fun.

605
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,125
Scott: You want to pick who's gonna make it the most fun.

606
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:52,123
Scott: So Just pick just be a jerk.

607
00:35:52,505 --> 00:35:54,775
Rym: I think you should have both I think open gaming and sign up.

608
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,261
Rym: gaming have places especially.

609
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,405
Rym: remember these are you know?

610
00:35:57,706 --> 00:35:59,331
Rym: sit down play a German board game for a Couple hours.

611
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:01,919
Rym: These are four to six hours of like.

612
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,792
Rym: I am dedicated to this and the game only has a certain number of slots And all that.

613
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:10,150
Scott: That's the other thing is sometimes, you know, like Alex and Jess they signed up for something.

614
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:18,510
Rym: yeah, it uh Basically, I kept looking over at their table and we're playing paranoia like got one dude on the party is turning into a werewolf.

615
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:21,339
Rym: So he starts to like howl cuz.

616
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,430
Rym: he can't hold it in and to cover up for that in character.

617
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:34,559
Rym: he starts singing the bouncy bubble fountain food beverage theme song from the commercials in the game and we all start singing and Everyone at that table kind of looks over at us.

618
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,050
Rym: Like I want to be over there.

619
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:45,419
Scott: Yeah, I think Alex said that basically he was playing Spirit of the Century which is a game that has a lot of hype and I'm pretty you know, but Apparently someone was right at the game.

620
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,380
Scott: like the default theme in the game is like 20s Indiana Jones pulp adventure which I'm totally all about.

621
00:36:51,581 --> 00:36:52,965
Scott: but it seemed like Alex.

622
00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:56,095
Scott: they were using the system to play A D&D dungeon with.

623
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:57,819
Scott: you know, kill kill the rats.

624
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,650
Rym: That's like the opposite of the point of our beyond D&D panel.

625
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,080
Scott: So Alex was.

626
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,910
Scott: he was basically like yeah, you know He couldn't really tell if the system was actually good or not.

627
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:18,888
Scott: and I'm I don't know about that system because it gets a lot of hype but the book is very large and Whatever, but you know He had not a good time in that particular instance of the game because it was just here's the trouble.

628
00:37:18,948 --> 00:37:20,554
Rym: and you have the same Thing at like anime con.

629
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:28,841
Rym: so you've got a panel right say you walk into the panel expecting whatever and it's totally lame And you're like one of four people sitting in the room.

630
00:37:29,604 --> 00:37:31,290
Rym: You just get up and walk the fuck out.

631
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,740
Rym: Yes, what if you're the only guy in the room?

632
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:34,884
Scott: Yes, definitely.

633
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:42,969
Rym: So gaming cons though It's much harder to do that because one, you know, it's like if you walk out of a panel You're not hurting the panel.

634
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:45,697
Rym: You might hurt the panel's feelings But you're not hurting the panel.

635
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,170
Rym: you walk out of a game that only had six slots.

636
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:52,766
Rym: You are hurting the game and everyone playing in it and the feelings of the guy running.

637
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:53,670
Rym: It's like a twofer.

638
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:57,245
Rym: Yeah, and you committed to six hours of that game.

639
00:37:57,727 --> 00:37:58,410
Rym: What are you gonna do now?

640
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,395
Rym: All the other games are full.

641
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:00,621
Rym: you can go to open gaming.

642
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,330
Rym: But now, you know, you're not having the same experience.

643
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:04,908
Rym: What are all the people who are gonna play in that game gonna do?

644
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,412
Scott: Mm-hmm.

645
00:38:06,432 --> 00:38:11,370
Rym: I don't know how to get around that except maybe every game should have a 15 minute, you know.

646
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:19,490
Rym: Let's start and play and then after those 15 minutes Every game in the entire con stops has a 10-minute break and you're allowed to not come back.

647
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:23,387
Scott: I think one good way to do it his is is a possible solution.

648
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:23,748
Scott: You're right.

649
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:29,730
Scott: The thing is is that you know, it takes preparation and efforts to run an RPG, right?

650
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:40,709
Scott: And the thing is most people want to play in like these particular awesome RPGs But there's only a few people will run them and those people will only run like one and that's it.

651
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:44,570
Scott: He won't run it like three or four times right like we will because we're nuts.

652
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:54,597
Scott: But you should do is you should just have it RPG con and you say everyone who's coming to this con must bring prepared RPG right.

653
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:05,304
Scott: and basically what you do is you get a group of people and one of you starts running your game and At any time, you know, you know, who's gonna play in your game.

654
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,909
Scott: if everyone's running games You don't run them all at the same time.

655
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:12,722
Scott: You take turns running games and you keep shuffling and mixing it.

656
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:15,170
Scott: if someone's game sucks cuz you know people's games will suck.

657
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,810
Scott: In fact, most of them will you know everyone, you know, most people don't have the GM skills.

658
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,230
Scott: They know they don't have the GM skills, but they come prepared with a game.

659
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:34,115
Scott: Anyway, maybe they come prepared with like oh, I'll say my baby at least right and you know You can just stop playing game and start one at any time because as long as you can just get people together Someone's got a game.

660
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:42,069
Scott: Maybe someone who had a fun game will run their game twice You know if they start with one group and then maybe they'll get you know shift to other people and so that way it.

661
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:42,390
Scott: you know.

662
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:58,690
Scott: Basically, people are constantly starting playing or stopping playing RPGs the whole time and everyone's got something prepared So that you know no matter, you know, you won't get in a situation where it's like well There's five people free, but none of us are GM's, you know, everyone's gonna get prepared to GM something.

663
00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:03,459
Rym: Well, if you want to fit it in more with the the way these cons already work I think a compromise.

664
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:23,392
Rym: take the idea of you know The games all have like a 20-minute introductory period where like everyone sits at the table, you know goes over all the stuff They're gonna do and then you have the break and at the break anyone who wants to leave a game goes over to the games that they want to join and then if you don't leave your game then you just come back to the game that you want to stay in and Then any.

665
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:25,560
Rym: if you go to a game and there's an open slot you get in.

666
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:36,890
Rym: if you go to a game and it's full Or whatever then you keep reshuffling, you know You have this whole like 20 minute period Where eventually everyone's in a game they want to be in or they've bailed completely on the games that sucked.

667
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:38,439
Scott: Yeah, I think that's another thing.

668
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:39,770
Scott: It's like I was playing T&E, right?

669
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,960
Scott: I was teaching and then running it for people like I didn't even play.

670
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:49,120
Scott: I just taught it and then sort of watched and helped and there are people who were just looking for games to play.

671
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:54,502
Scott: but my game was full because it only had four seats and I was like listen just sit and learn how to play.

672
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:58,283
Scott: you don't need to write, you know Even though you can't play they're like no they don't.

673
00:40:58,343 --> 00:41:03,747
Scott: they didn't want to right Like if I couldn't get into an RPG, I'd be happy like to sit there.

674
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:06,257
Scott: but it's like nope There's X slots and that's it.

675
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:09,690
Rym: go out, you know, so I don't know might be a difference in culture.

676
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,191
Rym: I mean we're.

677
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:23,310
Rym: we spend most of our gamer time at either anime con gaming or like generic on you know Like Dragon Con ConnectiCon style gaming where it's kind of geeks all playing games as opposed to gamer only people playing games.

678
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:31,432
Rym: The crowd at the recess was definitely the Gen Con crowd and not the dragon con or ConnectiCon or packs or any of that Crowd.

679
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:31,895
Scott: I don't know.

680
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:34,470
Scott: I have a feeling dragon con is also sort of the Gen Con crowd.

681
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:40,710
Scott: I think so But not as much as much a little bit different because Dragon Con has all these sort of different tracks.

682
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,362
Scott: I think dragon is technology.

683
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:44,354
Scott: It's got skepticism It's got all sorts of.

684
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:50,821
Rym: I would guess based on what my friends to go to Dragon Con say that half the gamers There are paxi kind of gamers and half the gamers.

685
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,110
Rym: There are Gen Con kind of game is anyway.

686
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:54,955
Scott: So is that all you did?

687
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:55,336
Scott: Saturday?

688
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:57,182
Scott: was you played the paranoia and that was it.

689
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:59,870
Rym: pretty much paranoia and dune and hanging out.

690
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:06,470
Rym: Sadly, you know Saturday night we all you know, the our games all ended We all got together and they had the cool party at this bar down the street.

691
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:08,019
Rym: So like oh, yeah, let's all go down.

692
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,789
Rym: We have a drink say hi to everyone then go home.

693
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:16,370
Rym: We go down there and the stupid bar wanted a $5 cover charge and not paying five bucks to walk in say hi and leave.

694
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:19,604
Rym: Yeah, especially considering that the bar for five bucks.

695
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:20,890
Scott: I can get like five candy bars.

696
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:26,070
Rym: Sadly the bar looked like it was general admission and all the other bars around weren't super crowded.

697
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:32,205
Rym: There was no real reason for that cover charge Except for the fact that they're trying to game five bucks off of all these gamers who wanted to.

698
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:35,839
Scott: there's no cover charge If we would have gone over earlier when the other people went over.

699
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,573
Rym: so the cover charge started right as the event We were all leaving ended.

700
00:42:40,095 --> 00:42:41,018
Scott: Yeah, that's awesome.

701
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:46,377
Rym: Yeah, I don't know who's who is responsible for setting that up But not well executed apparently.

702
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:52,480
Scott: they just weren't that many other places to go like, you know, they didn't choose, you know It's like there was no real choice of place.

703
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:55,010
Rym: Yeah, I would have been having even on Sunday, right?

704
00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:02,897
Scott: So on Sunday, I went out just looking for a place to eat, you know for lunch and it was surprised How many places were just closed?

705
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:07,113
Rym: Well that part of Brooklyn is definitely not super happy or sit-down What are you talking about?

706
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:09,044
Scott: That is like the Happeningist area in Brooklyn.

707
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:09,829
Scott: That's where all the shit is.

708
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:12,078
Rym: But right around there no bars.

709
00:43:12,158 --> 00:43:13,363
Rym: No restaurants open on Sunday.

710
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,090
Scott: The restaurants are open there to sit down.

711
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:17,721
Scott: I'm talking about walk in get food lunch kind of place.

712
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:18,284
Rym: Oh, whatever.

713
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,590
Rym: I mean there was that muffin place.

714
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:21,636
Scott: Yeah, that's not really lunch.

715
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:23,686
Rym: That is dead paninis and all sorts of stuff.

716
00:43:23,706 --> 00:43:24,530
Rym: That place was awesome.

717
00:43:24,751 --> 00:43:31,542
Scott: Anyway, so on Sunday, I went back and in the morning I signed up to play Starfarers of Catan.

718
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:35,884
Rym: remember we played that that's a good game Except that it's kind of broken once you've played it too many times.

719
00:43:36,044 --> 00:43:41,798
Scott: Yeah with the encounters Yeah, but if you don't know what the encounters do it's real fun I think is we sort of messed up the game.

720
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:48,089
Scott: We played it a little bit wrong, you know in that We deployed the beginning colonies like incorrectly or whatever.

721
00:43:48,912 --> 00:43:53,990
Scott: But you know in remembering how to play I was like, oh, yeah this game is a good game.

722
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:55,557
Scott: And now I kind of want to like.

723
00:43:55,939 --> 00:44:04,070
Scott: I think that that's really it, you know I've sort of wanted to play settlers, but then I keep remembering that like yes settlers is kind of broken and bad.

724
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:06,830
Scott: You know, it's like settlers itself sucks.

725
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:16,230
Scott: So I definitely I think I want to get back and try to do Star fairs or cities and nights and start playing that because you know to revive the settlers and thisness of it.

726
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:25,270
Rym: One thing that was interesting I kind of I miscalculated and that I hope to recruit a whole bunch more Pax East enforcers at this con or at this event.

727
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:29,703
Rym: So, you know, I went around I was talking to people and surprisingly almost everyone I talked to.

728
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:32,978
Rym: the conversation was along the lines of well What's Pax?

729
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,349
Rym: What's Pax East?

730
00:44:35,654 --> 00:44:36,805
Rym: What do you mean it like e3?

731
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:37,048
Rym: What's e3?

732
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,500
Rym: Penny arcade like they did I there's a huge.

733
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:43,727
Scott: the thing is there what the there is.

734
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,999
Scott: I know that you know That's not everybody.

735
00:44:46,362 --> 00:44:47,370
Scott: You didn't get like a goods.

736
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:48,195
Rym: No, it's not like.

737
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:50,850
Scott: I asked everyone to the con company when I was at the board game night.

738
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:56,330
Scott: There was a girl I talked to and she was there and she told me that she made like the first penny arcade website.

739
00:44:56,598 --> 00:44:58,798
Rym: Wow I would pretty much say that I talked.

740
00:44:58,878 --> 00:45:03,440
Rym: I asked about to 10 people 10 or 11 people and Two of them that I talked to.

741
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,281
Rym: you know, my small sample size Knew what was up and the rest of them had never heard any of these things.

742
00:45:08,884 --> 00:45:09,045
Rym: Hmm.

743
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:10,190
Rym: It was just interesting.

744
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,888
Rym: It's kind of like you go to an anime con and everyone at least knows what comics are and you go to like.

745
00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:18,126
Rym: You go to like a bigger gaming con and like I had the trivia remember.

746
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:21,018
Rym: Oh, yeah The trivia.

747
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:22,650
Scott: so we do this trivia, right?

748
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,977
Scott: And so we're first we.

749
00:45:24,118 --> 00:45:26,050
Scott: it's it's just front row crew people on a team.

750
00:45:26,151 --> 00:45:27,445
Scott: But then we got some other people on.

751
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:27,910
Rym: it was great.

752
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,403
Rym: We named a team that had nothing to do with that.

753
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:31,690
Scott: We couldn't think of a team name.

754
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,350
Scott: So we went with the Ozamanga Diode team name of C cucumber.

755
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:38,010
Scott: But then they broke our team up because there are too many big teams.

756
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,450
Scott: So suddenly we were back to just FRC people again and some other team was team C cucumber, right?

757
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:48,450
Scott: But then the people that split up from us were no longer on team C cucumber.

758
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:56,570
Scott: So actually some people were on team C cucumber and none of them had chosen that name Right and our team ended up being named big fire.

759
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:03,038
Scott: but I think next time we have to go with experts of just I think experts of justice is a more Profound and awesome sounding name.

760
00:46:03,098 --> 00:46:05,610
Scott: and then there was one guy who we didn't know who was on our team.

761
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:10,486
Scott: Also, however, he filled out a lot because we did not have the knowledge that he had.

762
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:15,326
Rym: round one was geek And pretty much every team got all of them, right or almost all of them, right?

763
00:46:15,446 --> 00:46:19,582
Rym: Yep round two We had almost nothing because it went right into nerd.

764
00:46:19,622 --> 00:46:21,550
Rym: We had we were done at that point.

765
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,633
Scott: Yeah, basically, we're like.

766
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:27,570
Scott: all the questions were like aimed at not us not us at all except the whole time.

767
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,210
Rym: We're like, wow, there's like no anime questions here at all.

768
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:36,365
Rym: We're pretty much boned unless they ask about like old-school gaming or old-school like anime.

769
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:48,754
Scott: and then they ask one question Hooked on okay and everyone our whole table is like what and the whole rest of the room is like what the fuck They went back to like.

770
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:49,918
Scott: what's the name of the do?

771
00:46:50,299 --> 00:46:51,704
Rym: what's the name of this Harry Potter thing?

772
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:53,290
Rym: or what's the name of this?

773
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,701
Rym: Thing from the dark tower that I've never actually read.

774
00:46:55,721 --> 00:46:57,510
Scott: Yeah, there's all these good.

775
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,958
Scott: There's questions about like wheel of time and stuff.

776
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:03,690
Scott: I mean Alex could cover some of the fantasy, but even he couldn't cover all of it.

777
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,228
Rym: Yeah, there's the one Silmarillion question, but it was deeper like it was such.

778
00:47:07,308 --> 00:47:11,407
Scott: it was like What was the name of the dog they used to find like I don't fucking remember.

779
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:14,470
Scott: I read that book And I was yes, why can't the answer be a Luvitar?

780
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:15,411
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

781
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:18,103
Scott: I know you could have asked a hundred questions about the Silmarillion.

782
00:47:18,144 --> 00:47:19,550
Scott: that would have gotten but they asked like.

783
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,875
Scott: You know one of the thousand questions I would not have gotten but at least that's.

784
00:47:22,915 --> 00:47:32,690
Rym: what makes a good trivia is if they gave every question, you know 95 percent of the answer but only the true nerds know the extra five percent.

785
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,276
Scott: Yeah, it's like one of the asshole.

786
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:42,390
Scott: they had these asshole questions and one of them was like, you know name all the superheroes That were on this cover of this comic and I was like, uh, it was a defenders comic.

787
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,061
Scott: So I'm like trying to guess and I know some of the defenders.

788
00:47:45,121 --> 00:47:47,130
Scott: I got like doctor strange, you know.

789
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:55,583
Scott: And the thing is like I probably could have gotten it with enough time, but it was just like duh Like they played a sound from a video game and they're like they didn't ask.

790
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:56,728
Rym: what video game is this.

791
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,809
Rym: they ask Specifically what action is happening right now?

792
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:00,813
Scott: Yeah, and the dig dug.

793
00:48:00,954 --> 00:48:03,525
Scott: one like if they played a sound clip from dig dug.

794
00:48:03,545 --> 00:48:04,810
Scott: that didn't sound like dig dug.

795
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:09,766
Scott: It sounded like you know frickin like space some space shooting game or something.

796
00:48:10,026 --> 00:48:11,170
Scott: Yeah, even Rym didn't know it.

797
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:11,780
Scott: It was dig dug.

798
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:14,196
Rym: I know of course Honestly, I played dig does.

799
00:48:14,477 --> 00:48:17,629
Scott: he would have gone like if they would have gone doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

800
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:21,270
Rym: Then I would I had dig dug immediately, but that's the difference between a geek and a nerd question.

801
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:27,219
Rym: Yeah, and the other one he was burger time and I was like, it's just burger time, duh But I couldn't tell what the action was.

802
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,183
Scott: Yes, like is it?

803
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:29,870
Scott: is it when he's peppers the bad guy?

804
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,668
Rym: well, I thought it was peppers, but I realized I think what screwed me up there?

805
00:48:32,688 --> 00:48:36,378
Rym: I Only really played burger time on the Intellivision.

806
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:38,926
Rym: Yeah, not on the arcade.

807
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:41,325
Scott: I totally bite you totally bite you.

808
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:48,298
Scott: but yeah We sucked ass at the trivia and we want if we had like some of our other FRC people's there we probably would have done a lot better.

809
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:48,780
Rym: Oh my god.

810
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,496
Scott: Yeah between like katsu Pete Nury You know cater Adam there.

00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:02,545
Scott: Yeah, we got like they were like what planet are the ultramarines from?

815
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:10,742
Scott: and like the one guy We didn't know when any FRC had any clue right but the random guy the strange guy He was like it was like lotrim are.

Scott: but no was ultramar.

817
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:13,990
Scott: It was like Pete would have had that in like a second.

818
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,499
Rym: Yeah, Pete in fact would have punched all of us for not knowing it.

819
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,208
Scott: Yeah that the ultramarines are from ultramar.

820
00:49:19,228 --> 00:49:21,010
Scott: Yeah Yeah, we feel stupid.

821
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,977
Rym: But anyway, it was a good time.

822
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:24,961
Rym: It was really well run.

823
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:25,783
Rym: the questions were good.

824
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:27,709
Rym: I like the whole asshole question thing.

825
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,417
Rym: Oops banging into your microphone.

826
00:49:30,558 --> 00:49:31,703
Scott: Yeah, my headphones banged into him.

827
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:33,250
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what else you have to say.

828
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,027
Rym: I just thought it was a super.

829
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:38,626
Scott: well I I need to talk about what I did and the reason I went back on Sunday.

830
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,494
Scott: The primary reason was Later on Sunday.

831
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:48,639
Scott: I basically felt like a complete moron waiting in the front of the registration line, you know But I did wait in that front of registration line.

832
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:51,130
Scott: I ran out to lunch came back and got in the front of the line.

833
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:57,888
Scott: Also everyone liked oshi who I played it with oshi was pretty popular because people didn't know it But they loved it when I played it with them.

834
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:10,670
Scott: but I signed up and played free market for reals with Jared and these three other dudes and I am prepared to to spill all sorts of beans about free market, which which beans would you like to be spilled?

835
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:11,596
Scott: I don't know.

836
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,429
Rym: I'm not sure what I want to know about the game.

837
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:19,585
Scott: Okay, basically the way free market goes is it's the new RPG from Lucre and Jed.

838
00:50:19,665 --> 00:50:21,730
Scott: Jared Sorenson team up it.

839
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:23,688
Scott: The pre-orders are gonna be in March.

840
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:33,117
Scott: There's no dice and it goes something like this so you're on the space station and The space station gives you everything.

841
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:36,930
Scott: There's a computer on the space station, but it's not like Hal or the paranoia computer.

842
00:50:37,774 --> 00:50:41,130
Scott: It just sort of is brain, you know, it doesn't have any motivation or anything.

843
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:45,891
Scott: it just sort of provides everyone with food in the basics and That's it.

844
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:48,578
Scott: So you have to get the idea.

845
00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:50,162
Scott: the game is to get flow.

846
00:50:50,443 --> 00:50:56,802
Scott: you got to get flow and the way you get flow Is by you know doing various things like.

847
00:50:57,063 --> 00:51:01,379
Scott: you can friend people friending people, you know if people become your friends you get flow.

848
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:07,169
Scott: if you will give you like smiley faces or You know doing various things you can get flow, right?

849
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:25,140
Scott: so you got to get flow and So you have this character and your character has experiences interface Technology and memories and these things are what you use to get flow right and memories Turn into experience in this whole thing.

850
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:36,010
Scott: All right, so you basically All the people all the players join a mercy a Merc Z Right, and that is your group and your group has some sort of objective.

851
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,156
Scott: So it can just be whatever the hell you want.

852
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:39,660
Scott: Like you can just anything.

853
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,410
Scott: All right, so ours was like fucking teeth.

854
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:46,946
Scott: I think we called it like guts and gums and we're just like yet fucking teeth.

855
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:47,830
Scott: That's what we care about.

856
00:51:49,772 --> 00:51:55,310
Scott: And I was a. I was like a a cyber athlete of sorts, you know.

857
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,976
Scott: And the other with jouster.

858
00:51:56,996 --> 00:51:59,224
Scott: no, it was like we decide.

859
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:00,710
Scott: we just came up with shit on the fly.

860
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:08,689
Scott: so it was like it was called like schnoz ball or whatever and I didn't even make up what the sport actually was until I had to play it and what you know.

861
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:14,170
Scott: But basically, you know, you were playing this game and we're like, okay, how do we start?

862
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,057
Scott: So he's just like reading various like.

863
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:27,576
Scott: he starts off by telling us what we have in our like little Mercies area because space is a commodity like physical space is like rare because the space station was designed for 40,000 But there's 80,000 people.

864
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:30,517
Rym: So there's a movie.

865
00:52:30,637 --> 00:52:31,483
Rym: there were 80,000, right?

866
00:52:33,272 --> 00:52:39,430
Scott: So he's basically telling us like, you know This is the stuff you have right and we're like some and one of the things had to do with pets.

867
00:52:39,652 --> 00:52:41,870
Scott: So suddenly we start the game by going we got to make a pet.

868
00:52:43,074 --> 00:52:52,130
Scott: So we try to make this tooth fairy and The tooth fairy comes out all like nasty and gross and we're like, okay Well, let's let's make a movie with the tooth fairy.

869
00:52:52,491 --> 00:53:03,068
Scott: That'll be like a wicked YouTube type meme and spread over the whole space station and somehow we managed to pull it off where the tooth fairy became wicked popular across the entire station.

870
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:12,333
Scott: and suddenly people start calling us up like, you know, we created this mean people wanted to get like these pliers and pouches to pull their Teeth out or whatever.

871
00:53:12,353 --> 00:53:15,724
Rym: It all comes back to the Perry Bible Fellowship, right?

872
00:53:16,266 --> 00:53:19,724
Scott: So we're like, oh shit We got to make these pliers and things.

873
00:53:20,188 --> 00:53:22,958
Scott: So Basically, we realized that we all sweet.

874
00:53:23,018 --> 00:53:25,490
Scott: None of us had the printing experience, which means it sucks.

875
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:28,903
Scott: We suck at making things which is why our tooth fairy came out all nasty.

876
00:53:28,923 --> 00:53:37,530
Scott: So I Called up the guy who makes my sporting equipment, you know, and I'm like we need you to make this thing for us.

877
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,617
Scott: He's like, what are you gonna do for me?

878
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:40,669
Scott: So basically I had to like.

879
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:43,888
Scott: My rivals daughter was a fan of me.

880
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:49,710
Scott: So he wanted, you know, but my rival was also a customer of his and he wanted to make my rival happy.

881
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:55,250
Scott: So we took a memory out of me modified it and implanted it in my rivals daughter.

882
00:53:55,350 --> 00:54:04,277
Scott: So now she liked her father and not me and then I was in a sporting event with her father and I ripped his fucking Basically blew his teeth.

883
00:54:04,297 --> 00:54:10,870
Scott: I blew his skull in half and blew his teeth all over the crowd as we were Giving them all the pliers that they want.

884
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:32,038
Scott: So that's that's the kind of game that comes out of at a free market, but basically the way the game works is you have these cards and What the how you use how the challenges work use the cards to resolve the challenges and are really sort of crazy and incredibly difficult to understand way Which is I think a negative.

885
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,510
Scott: but at the same time he said that they did it that way on purpose.

886
00:54:36,113 --> 00:54:39,309
Scott: So it's like they made the challenges intentionally complex.

887
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:47,194
Scott: but even though the way the challenges worked with these cards and the conflict resolution and how many cards do you draw and what Do they do?

888
00:54:47,275 --> 00:54:48,910
Scott: and how do you figure out who wins?

889
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:57,081
Scott: Like you need like a reference sheet to learn figure this shit out like big time Even though that was really complicated for some reason.

890
00:54:57,121 --> 00:55:01,116
Scott: the way the game worked the role-playing like came real easy.

891
00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:09,690
Scott: if you couldn't tell you know, huh and Like, you know, basically everyone gets like one of these sort of like attaboy tokens.

892
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:10,687
Scott: That's sort of like, you know.

893
00:55:11,223 --> 00:55:18,136
Scott: Yeah If someone else does something awesome you throw your token at them and the rule is you only get one token per session to give To someone else.

894
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:23,430
Scott: when you give it to someone they get flow But one person can only receive one token per session.

895
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:28,284
Scott: So if you do ten awesome things in this ten players, you can't get nine tokens.

896
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:38,509
Scott: You can only get one and you know, so Throughout the game like everyone threw their token at me at some point and I was after the first one I had to say like I already have one like three times.

897
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:43,725
Rym: Well, we're kind of used to the whole burning wheel, you know crazy gaming stuff already.

898
00:55:43,745 --> 00:55:52,698
Scott: A lot of people aren't yeah But I definitely you know, I have the PDF for free market and if I could just get the cards I am totally prepared to run this game.

899
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:53,421
Scott: I think it is a game.

900
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:56,170
Scott: I could definitely run with awesomeness.

904
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,828
