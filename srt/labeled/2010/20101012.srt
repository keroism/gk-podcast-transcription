1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,575
Scott: It's Tuesday, October 12th.

2
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:12,180
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:13,019
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,170
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,140
Scott: Tonight, Boggle Boggle.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,956
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:27,599
Rym: Waka waka waka.

8
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:28,375
Scott: No.

9
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:32,420
Rym: I don't know why we thought that was a good idea for a title.

10
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:33,498
Scott: Why wouldn't it be?

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,224
Rym: I don't know.

12
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:35,799
Rym: It just seems... odd.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,997
Scott: What's odd about it?

14
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:38,440
Rym: Boggle Boggle?

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:38,848
Rym: Yeah.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,146
Rym: Why not just say it once?

17
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:41,999
Rym: Like Arakawa under the bridgey bridgey?

18
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:42,683
Scott: Yeah.

19
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:45,517
Scott: And because one of our most popular episodes was...

20
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:47,080
Rym: Boggle Boggle.

21
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:47,818
Rym: Exactly.

22
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:55,500
Rym: So, exactly 47 hours ago, I stopped drinking caffeine.

23
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:56,594
Scott: Alrighty.

24
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:57,726
Rym: Not permanently.

25
00:00:58,634 --> 00:00:59,279
Rym: I did a bunch of research.

26
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,580
Scott: Well, what's the point if it's not permanently?

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,201
Scott: Well,

28
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:16,200
Rym: because I got bored and I was reading something over lunch and I learned a lot, this was last week, about caffeine and the effects on the body and the fact that once you build up a tolerance, it takes 48 hours, almost exactly on average, to reach the peak withdrawal symptoms.

29
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:23,780
Rym: And then after that, by five days, all effects of caffeine are reversed and you're back to normal and your tolerance is zero.

30
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:30,180
Rym: So it's been a long time since I've experienced what caffeine does when you don't have a tolerance for caffeine.

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,620
Scott: So basically, it's kind of like, remember back in... It's hard to avoid though, because I mean, I don't drink coffee or soda, but I mean, if you eat a Hershey's chocolate bar, that's it.

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,439
Rym: There's so little, it basically doesn't count.

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,560
Scott: I'm just saying, it's still, you know, it's like you gotta get zero, otherwise you gotta add a few hours, you know.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,120
Rym: Yeah, but I'm right now at the peak of caffeine withdrawal, something I've not experienced in like four or five years.

35
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,979
Scott: What does it feel like?

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,860
Rym: It feels like a pounding headache.

37
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:55,356
Rym: Really?

38
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:56,339
Rym: That will not cease.

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,839
Scott: Yeah, you really have a big headache?

40
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,200
Rym: I have a crazy headache.

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,100
Scott: Did you take a Tylenol?

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,040
Rym: No, fuck that.

43
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:01,960
Scott: That's right.

44
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:02,659
Scott: I'm gonna man up.

45
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,219
Scott: That's right.

46
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,699
Rym: Actually, I'm gonna take some aspirin right after the show.

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:06,428
Scott: Yeah?

48
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:06,957
Scott: Yes.

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,679
Rym: There's no aspirin tolerance.

50
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:11,359
Scott: Yes.

51
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,580
Rym: But I'm interested to see, because caffeine is a performance enhancer in many ways.

52
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:22,620
Rym: But if you're a habitual user, it has kind of, it's like a pro and con thing, it's like a min-max.

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,319
Rym: Like in Fallout, when you take like the one medicine that gives you one thing but hurts you another way, like the rads.

54
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:27,917
Rym: Yeah.

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,279
Rym: So I'm trying to clear out my rads.

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:43,460
Rym: Much like, I think you've done this once or twice, remember the high school or college days when you'd have the plan of... If I don't masturbate for like a day, then it'll be way awesome when I do finally masturbate.

57
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:45,698
Rym: No, you never saved up?

58
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:46,159
Rym: No.

59
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:46,447
Rym: No?

60
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:46,956
Rym: No.

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,139
Rym: You just masturbated every day?

62
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:50,480
Scott: No, I just did whatever I felt like it.

63
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:53,839
Scott: Anyway, I'd feel like it and then I wouldn't feel like it.

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,717
Rym: I don't know, sometimes I have those days where I just always felt like it.

65
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,639
Scott: No, that's 'cause you got some heat.

66
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:03,140
Rym: Or I was just bored, like when the wand servers were down.

67
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,660
Scott: I just play some video games that weren't wands.

68
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:06,786
Rym: Like what?

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,660
Rym: I guess tribes.

70
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,539
Scott: And watch some animes.

71
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:11,960
Rym: Alright.

72
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:12,386
Rym: So?

73
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:13,879
Scott: So I got some news here.

74
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:14,377
Rym: Oh, do ya?

75
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:14,734
Scott: Yeah.

76
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:19,500
Scott: So, you know, we saw at PAX, Sonic 4.

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,638
Scott: And it was looking pretty good, wasn't it?

78
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,160
Rym: Yeah, it looks like they finally got rid of the stretchy werewolf and just went back to Sonic runs around the game.

79
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,740
Scott: Well, they got two games, actually, that are coming out.

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,020
Scott: Sonic 4, which is a two and a half D. It's like the old school Sonic side-scrolling game, but it's two and a half D. And that's what I've been asking for.

81
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,400
Scott: I've been like, you know, Nintendo sorta did it.

82
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:47,400
Scott: It's like, look, you have these old 2D games, just make the exact same game, only make it two and a half D. Use a 3D game engine, but just keep the camera to the side and move it, you know, don't move it in or out.

83
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,920
Rym: Or occasionally do something clever.

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,740
Scott: Occasionally, but keep that light.

85
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:53,420
Scott: You still want it to be fundamentally a side-scrolling game.

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,280
Rym: I mean, even in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you could throw the dude at the screen.

87
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,039
Scott: Exactly.

88
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,339
Scott: Alright, that's perfectly fine.

89
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:08,900
Scott: And you can make some really good games, you know, with the easiness of 3D engines and the good looking graphics without having to do sprites like the old days with the pixels, right?

90
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,920
Scott: And, you know, it'd be really awesome.

91
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,039
Scott: So they did that, they're coming out with Sonic 4, which is that.

92
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,840
Scott: They're also coming up with Sonic Colors.

93
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,000
Scott: And Sonic Colors is basically the werewolf game without the werewolf part, from what we can tell.

94
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:32,900
Scott: What's interesting is what they're doing is they're basically telling all the stores, you know, to try to take all the other Sonic games off the shelves, right?

95
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:41,960
Scott: The only Sonic games on the shelves, once these games come out, there's also a Kinect Sonic free writing game.

96
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,719
Scott: And I think Sonic 4 is also coming to DS or Sonic, something's coming to DS, I don't know.

97
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:51,520
Scott: They're basically trying to say, hey, get these old games off the shelves so that only the good Sonic titles will be on the shelf.

98
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,200
Scott: That way, if they can maintain the quality, you know, and keep only quality Sonic stuff available.

99
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,560
Rym: So how are they going to get them off the shelves?

100
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,840
Scott: I mean, they basically say, hey, don't sell these anymore or return them or sell them now before the new ones come out.

101
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,429
Rym: Yeah, but no one buys them anyway.

102
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:09,979
Rym: There's a reason they're on the shelves.

103
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:10,705
Scott: Right.

104
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,220
Scott: But, you know, they'll get into the discount.

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,700
Rym: Kind of like remember that GameStop we went to in Wildwood that had like five tables full of Madden games.

106
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,281
Scott: Yeah.

107
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:21,180
Scott: I mean, they'll at least get them into the discount bin and off the rack.

108
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,501
Scott: Right.

109
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:30,547
Scott: So that way, hopefully, you know, over time, the people will get a better impression of Sonic, you know, and they won't dilute the franchise.

110
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:34,480
Scott: if all the Sonic games on the shelves are good and they may keep that that way.

111
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:35,969
Rym: It's hard to say.

112
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:37,080
Rym: I mean, it'll take a while.

113
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,863
Scott: It'll take a while.

114
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:38,485
Scott: Gamers care.

115
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:42,520
Rym: But this could only affect people who are not hardcore gamers and don't know anything.

116
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:42,981
Rym: Yeah.

117
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:49,140
Rym: Because anyone who knows anything will either know what they did or will know, yes, the new Sonic games are better and I play those.

118
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:53,340
Rym: Or maybe I prefer the old shitty Sonic games because I'm a terrible person.

119
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:53,841
Scott: Yeah.

120
00:05:53,901 --> 00:06:03,900
Scott: I mean, the quote here from the from the person who works for Sega is we could make a lot of money on back catalog Sonic titles, but let's keep the number of Sonic games available under control.

121
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,920
Scott: Otherwise, you can have cannibalization if there are 10 Sonic games on the shelves with people seeing Sonic Rush DS or Sonic Rush Adventure.

122
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,420
Scott: This may not help our overall strategy, which is which is to make Sonic stop sucking.

123
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,340
Scott: And it looks like, you know, at least from these previews of Sonic for I mean, I'm going to get Sonic for it.

124
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:30,560
Scott: It's actually the episodic nous of it while sort of annoying is actually has a benefit in that I can try it out for less money than the whole game to see if it's any good.

125
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,351
Scott: And that I don't have to buy the rest of the levels.

126
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,660
Rym: And at the same time, it sucks.

127
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:44,160
Rym: Wasn't there the demo problem we learned about at the previous packs where if there is a short demo of a game available, sales tend to collapse because people realize, oh, that's what that game is.

128
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,024
Rym: I don't need to play anymore.

129
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:46,029
Scott: But there might not be.

130
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:47,616
Scott: The thing is, this isn't a demo.

131
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:48,420
Scott: This is you buy.

132
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:56,840
Scott: That's like saying, oh, man, Half-Life 2, episode two, you know, I guess no one will buy that if there's a demo called Half-Life 2, but Half-Life 2 is not free.

133
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:59,409
Scott: So, yeah, OK, so your demo is not free.

134
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:02,040
Scott: So you're still making money off all the people who buy the first part.

135
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:05,860
Scott: So and then maybe one day they'll buy the second part, you know, way later.

136
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,120
Rym: My only concern is, are they as are there any details on how they're trying to get these old Sonic games off the shelves?

137
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,740
Scott: Because I already stopped printing them and stop releasing new ones that way.

138
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,803
Rym: Oh, that's fine.

139
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:17,265
Rym: That's fine.

140
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:21,360
Rym: But the thing is, what do you do with the GameStop that has every Sonic title in a giant pile?

141
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:25,040
Scott: I'm sure they'll stay in a giant pile until the GameStop doesn't know.

142
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,963
Rym: See, I'm curious.

143
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:30,780
Rym: I wonder if they're going to pull strong arm tactics like a lot of manufacturers do with Amazon, where they pull that B.S.

144
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,560
Rym: where you see a thing in Amazon and it's like the MSRP is X, the real price.

145
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,069
Rym: We can't show you unless you add it to your cart.

146
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:41,039
Rym: But then when you add it to your cart, you see what the real price is.

147
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:43,459
Scott: Yeah, that's what happened with some of the TVs I was looking at.

148
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:43,861
Scott: Yep.

149
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,886
Rym: However, notice how Amazon changed it now.

150
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:51,440
Rym: Instead of having to add it to your cart, you click show me the price and it quote unquote adds it to your cart.

151
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,383
Scott: It depends on the item.

152
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:58,200
Scott: There are some items you can click show me the price and some you actually have to go like proceed to check out, like all the way.

153
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,562
Rym: I haven't seen that in a long time.

154
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:07,760
Rym: It was a recent change because, you know, almost all of the audio and video equipment I'm looking at, Amazon selling way under MSRP.

155
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:09,268
Scott: Interesting.

156
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,179
Scott: All right.

157
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
Rym: Because, you know, Project ST is coming along and I'm looking at HD cameras.

158
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,680
Rym: I luckily Amazon reviews saved me from buying one that was really cheap and really awesome looking.

159
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:19,859
Scott: But it wasn't good.

160
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:21,085
Rym: It was like a Canon one.

161
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:22,129
Rym: It was like six hundred bucks.

162
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,377
Rym: It looked super like good for like the HV 40, whatever.

163
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,082
Rym: I forget.

164
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:31,215
Rym: All I remember is I heard that one's good at everything we needed, except it's medium and low light.

165
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:33,059
Rym: performance was the worst.

166
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,807
Rym: Like if the lights don't have lights.

167
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:35,711
Rym: Yeah.

168
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,520
Rym: But even then, we need a good camera.

169
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:41,910
Rym: Like it was way under way cheaper cameras in bad light.

170
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:43,434
Rym: But it was great if you have awesome light.

171
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:44,116
Scott: Interesting.

172
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:44,598
Scott: Yeah.

173
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:45,159
Scott: All right.

174
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,066
Scott: So what you got over there?

175
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,180
Rym: Well, we were at the burning convention.

176
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:50,567
Scott: You want to talk about the burning?

177
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:52,436
Rym: I want to talk about the burning convention because it was.

178
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:53,320
Scott: Did you get burned?

179
00:08:53,901 --> 00:09:01,260
Rym: I got burned once because I, you know, with the New York Comic-Con and all the other stuff going on, I did not technically register to play games.

180
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:09,200
Rym: So I was not going to show up and like manhandle my way into a game that someone flew from like Seattle to be there to play.

181
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:09,922
Scott: Yeah.

182
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:12,653
Scott: I think there was at least one guy from the UK, I think.

183
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:12,974
Scott: Right.

184
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:13,295
Scott: Yeah.

185
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:13,596
Scott: Yeah.

186
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:14,520
Scott: It was pretty interesting.

187
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,532
Scott: Basically, on Friday, we went to the New York Comic-Con New Guiana Festival.

188
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:18,998
Scott: We'll talk about that another day.

189
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:19,079
Rym: Yep.

190
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,385
Rym: Some Wednesday forthcoming.

191
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:32,340
Scott: The only I will say, though, this is gaming related, that I forgot that Inafune, the creator of Mega Man, well, one of the, you know, effectively creator of Mega Man, it was obviously a team effort, right, was there.

192
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,348
Scott: And that was the only thing I forgot about and did not see.

193
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:37,100
Scott: I could have gone to Chile with him at the Capcom booth, whatever.

194
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,208
Scott: I'm sure I'll see him again someday.

195
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:44,625
Rym: There was also the fact that WotC was there and I did not realize, I don't even know when they announced it.

196
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,333
Rym: I'm just so disconnected from WotC's BS.

197
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:49,680
Rym: They have D&D Gamma World.

198
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,387
Scott: That's what everyone's talking about lately.

199
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:53,740
Rym: And I looked at the mechanic as far as I can tell.

200
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,206
Scott: It's D&D, but Gamma World.

201
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:55,467
Scott: Yeah.

202
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,540
Rym: It's literally, hey, you thought Gamma World was cool, right?

203
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,660
Rym: Well, we're going to put all the Gamma World proper nouns on top of your shitty same old Dungeons and Dragons.

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,322
Scott: That's exactly.

205
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,456
Scott: All they do is they sell a book that has different proper nouns.

206
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:06,959
Scott: That's all they do.

207
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:08,726
Rym: It's brilliant in a way.

208
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:09,188
Rym: Yeah.

209
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,077
Scott: I mean, they do change some numbers, right?

210
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:19,518
Scott: They have to be like, OK, look, instead of sword, it's slime laser and it does not a D8 damage.

211
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:20,379
Scott: It does a D6.

212
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,634
Rym: It does a D8, but you have the special D8 that you got to buy.

213
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:25,939
Rym: There's a picture of a laser on it.

214
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:27,102
Scott: Whatever.

215
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:27,985
Rym: I'm waiting for that day.

216
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:31,157
Scott: But yeah, I, you know, I went to the Comic-Con.

217
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:31,960
Scott: I took Friday off.

218
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,460
Scott: I went to the Comic-Con MFS Live Friday, so I had Saturday and Sunday free to go to the Burning Con all day, both days.

219
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,200
Scott: And I played in every session except the final one, because I was too tired.

220
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,820
Rym: Yeah, I remember Emily and I got back and you were just like passed out on the couch.

221
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,021
Scott: Yeah.

222
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:53,020
Rym: So that was part of the reason why I decided to give up caffeine for a while, because at the con, I drank like four Red Bulls.

223
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,363
Scott: That's too many.

224
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:59,220
Rym: And then I like I felt the Red Bull running out as we're hanging out on the couch and I was just done.

225
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,086
Scott: You know, you should do so.

226
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:00,308
Scott: Wait.

227
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:01,840
Scott: So what was the last time you had a caffeine?

228
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,099
Rym: Forty seven and a half hours ago.

229
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:13,920
Scott: You should you should call Conrad and challenge him to who has who can rack up more consecutive no caffeine hours, because maybe if it's a game might have to go into minutes.

230
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,386
Scott: I'm just saying we can talk.

231
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:16,927
Scott: We can get it.

232
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:21,500
Rym: You know, I think if I called Conrad and pointed, what did you got it?

233
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,980
Scott: What would it be fair to have a taurine, no sugar, but no caffeine beverage?

234
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,636
Rym: Yeah, but what would not be fair is drinking like a rana because that just metabolizes into caffeine.

235
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:31,620
Scott: Really interesting.

236
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:40,059
Rym: That's how I learned a lot about caffeine, but it is a performance enhancer and it decreases the risk of Alzheimer's straight up.

237
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,141
Scott: All right.

238
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:49,700
Rym: Anyway, I do want to point out with the comic con, though, and the gaming stuff, I kind of got on my caffeine tangent there because it's kind of on my mind because of this blazing headache.

239
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:50,367
Scott: That's fine.

240
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:51,154
Scott: You deserve it.

241
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:54,919
Rym: Is that Watsy?

242
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:03,760
Rym: It's weird how the perceptions of this con from us as like performers and people who work with the people on the back end went because before it was like, yeah, double con.

243
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:06,760
Rym: We'll do like five or six panels, all our awesome stuff.

244
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:14,500
Rym: And it looked like gaming was going to be a huge part because there was a lot of gaming at the New York Comic Con in previous years.

245
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,545
Scott: The biggest gaming was.

246
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:18,760
Scott: there was a Square Enix booth, which had a bunch of anime fans pretty thrilled.

247
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,281
Scott: Right.

248
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,820
Scott: And there was a. there was a Capcom booth, which is really the best.

249
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,739
Scott: And they because they had Marvel's Capcom three showing off.

250
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,905
Scott: We got all the guys.

251
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:28,493
Scott: That's definitely the game for a comic.

252
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:29,820
Rym: There was good art around that.

253
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,780
Rym: You know what I found out about Marvel's Capcom three?

254
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,484
Rym: Did you find out?

255
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,719
Scott: it has simple mode, you know, simple mode works.

256
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,708
Rym: Mega Man wins.

257
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,620
Scott: No, there's an attack button.

258
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:43,100
Scott: There's a special move button and there's another button.

259
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:44,428
Rym: I think I could be good at that.

260
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:46,158
Rym: So all you do is got no, no, no.

261
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,040
Rym: Fast forward to like a year from now, we've got this game.

262
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:54,080
Rym: You go online to play simple mode and some dude still just kicks our asses into the ground.

263
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,580
Scott: Apparently in simple mode, you only have access to a couple of special moves.

264
00:12:57,741 --> 00:12:59,337
Scott: It's basically like playing Smash Brothers.

265
00:12:59,418 --> 00:12:59,600
Scott: Right.

266
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:04,139
Scott: And when you play a non simple mode, you have a lot more moves available to you.

267
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:06,020
Scott: But it's you know, it's not simple.

268
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:18,240
Rym: But while there was gaming stuff prior to the con and based on previous comic cons, like gaming, because it's a thriving, vibrant industry, appeared like it was going to be a really big part of the comic con.

269
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,304
Rym: Like originally we were talks.

270
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:24,379
Rym: They were like, yeah, run all those awesome gaming panels you run at PAX, because we really want to ramp up the gaming.

271
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:29,720
Rym: And as the con got bigger and bigger and, you know, we eventually it did sell out on Saturday.

272
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:31,119
Rym: It was a frickin enormous con.

273
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:39,340
Rym: I think the hierarchy of industries at the very bottom is fan produced anime related stuff.

274
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:42,900
Rym: At that con, the bottom of the bottom was fan anime.

275
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,960
Rym: The anime artist alley was at the bottom left corner of the Javits.

276
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,765
Scott: Yeah, that was.

277
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:47,691
Scott: they separated it.

278
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,980
Scott: I kind of wish it would have been combined.

279
00:13:49,120 --> 00:14:01,220
Scott: They combined the dealers rooms, even though the exhibit hall, which was also the dealers room, right, was segregated, like all the old school, all the comic retailers in one corner and all the publishers in another area and all the toys in another area.

280
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,439
Scott: You know, the best booth is Bandai booth.

281
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,420
Rym: But the point I want to make is that so that's the bottom.

282
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,220
Rym: And above that was, you know, professional anime stuff.

283
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:13,760
Rym: And then like indie comics and then real comics and gaming.

284
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:17,480
Rym: And above all of that, far and away was Hollywood bullshit.

285
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,977
Scott: Yeah, Hollywood and TV.

286
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:22,740
Rym: Animal Planet had one of the biggest booths in there.

287
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,379
Scott: It wasn't that big, but it was the fanciest.

288
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,874
Scott: Yeah, it's all go inside.

289
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:26,420
Scott: You go inside.

290
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:28,052
Rym: I looked outside.

291
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:28,800
Rym: There's a video playing.

292
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,660
Rym: And as far as I can tell, it's promoting a show that is about like searching for Bigfoot.

293
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:33,309
Scott: OK.

294
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:33,860
Rym: Yeah.

295
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,500
Scott: That's why is that an animal plant?

296
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,000
Rym: The same reason Animal Planet's primary other programing seems to be midgets.

297
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,059
Scott: We're talking about the Burning Con.

298
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:40,809
Scott: Midgets?

299
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:41,219
Scott: Yeah.

300
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:41,899
Rym: Yeah, midgets.

301
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,800
Scott: Let's talk about the Burning Con.

302
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:43,340
Rym: And ghosts.

303
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,980
Rym: But it was weird that the New York Universal Comic Con was going to have this big gaming presence and Hollywood just kicked it right to the curb.

304
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,393
Scott: Yep.

305
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,099
Rym: So we had to get all of our gaming at the Burning Con.

306
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:57,960
Scott: Burning Con is pretty much just play burning games all weekend.

307
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,040
Scott: And that's exactly what I did.

308
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,400
Scott: And all the games were awesome to various degrees of awesome.

309
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,139
Rym: It was funny to be there.

310
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,300
Scott: Even the one that I ran.

311
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:12,700
Scott: And the weirdest thing that I want to say is that during the course of the weekend, everyone kept talking about this RPG called Apocalypse World.

312
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,117
Scott: And they keep telling me how awesome it is.

313
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,519
Scott: And then when I played free market, right, I was running it.

314
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,520
Scott: And they were all talking about this apocalypse world.

315
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:24,099
Scott: And they were like, that guy who just got up from the table was the guy who made it.

316
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:27,920
Scott: I was like, so the guy who made this game everyone was talking about played in my free market.

317
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,019
Scott: And, you know, they seemed like they liked it.

318
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,619
Scott: So I guess I did a good job.

319
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:32,419
Rym: We'll see.

320
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,080
Scott: We'll see.

321
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:33,739
Scott: We'll see.

322
00:15:34,321 --> 00:15:36,998
Rym: I played in one game that was basically, all right, 60 years.

323
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,499
Rym: You know, there was one of those like Rym games where someone makes a weird like setting and you play Burning Wheel in it.

324
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:42,640
Scott: I hate it when people do that.

325
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,660
Scott: I just want to play straight up.

326
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,560
Rym: Half the games there were like that.

327
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:44,860
Scott: I know.

328
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,679
Scott: I only played in straight up games.

329
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,320
Scott: I didn't plan any weird hacks or anything.

330
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,999
Rym: But it was all right.

331
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:52,620
Rym: It's like 60 years before Sauron and all this bullshit in the Lord of the Rings world.

332
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,940
Rym: And no man can kill the Witch King, right?

333
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,198
Scott: So, well, I mean, yeah, people could.

334
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,176
Scott: No man.

335
00:15:58,622 --> 00:15:58,818
Scott: Real hard.

336
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,397
Rym: No man.

337
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,109
Scott: OK.

338
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:06,479
Rym: So knowing that they form a squad of female assassins and we went off to try to kill the Witch King.

339
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,520
Rym: We succeeded in killing one Nazgul and then we ran out of time because it was one in the morning.

340
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,400
Scott: OK.

341
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,572
Scott: How about that?

342
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:19,800
Rym: But it was funny to see, you know, Luke, you know, he's there and all the people are there and they're so excited.

343
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:20,840
Rym: And he gave the keynote.

344
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,739
Rym: I'm glad that he actually had a keynote and called it a keynote, even though he should have done something about that UPS that was beeping throughout the entirety of it.

345
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:28,278
Scott: Yeah.

346
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,920
Scott: I mean, you know, it's not something he does that often.

347
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,758
Scott: He's got to build the skills.

348
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,240
Rym: Yeah, that's definitely true.

349
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,579
Scott: But then there's no way to better way to build the skills and do it.

350
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:44,157
Rym: The funny part was a lot of people traveled from way away to be here because burning wheel people who get into it are hardcore.

351
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:58,060
Rym: Like you get to a point where you realize, yeah, I'm one of those burning wheel people and to be in a place where it was all hardcore burning wheel people and all of the Luke was basically it was weird because they were kind of nervous around him.

352
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:00,980
Rym: But at the same time, gamers are generally more chill with each other.

353
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:02,219
Rym: They were also chill.

354
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,980
Rym: So people would be like, really, really nervous and like almost hero worshiping Luke.

355
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:10,617
Rym: But then, like, he'd start talking and then a second later, they're totally chill and just talking with him.

356
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:11,059
Rym: Yeah.

357
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,261
Rym: It's like the opposite of when we go to an anime con, there's the famous person and it's just.

358
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:18,040
Scott: he's not Gary Gygax.

359
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,958
Scott: He lives down the street.

360
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,159
Rym: It's like, well, he lives down the street from us.

361
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:25,255
Rym: He doesn't live down the street from everyone, but it's still.

362
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,140
Scott: it's like they were in his house the night before.

363
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:27,873
Scott: It's not like.

364
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,380
Rym: Yeah.

365
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,712
Rym: Though we do definitely, I think, take I don't.

366
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:37,942
Rym: we're too used to the fact that if we have a problem, like we have a rules issue, we just email Luke and he's like, oh, here you go.

367
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:39,776
Scott: He sort of gets it.

368
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,040
Scott: I sort of bother him, whatever.

369
00:17:41,402 --> 00:17:42,257
Scott: He doesn't like it.

370
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:42,595
Rym: Yeah.

371
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,018
Rym: Like Luke.

372
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,140
Scott: Now that I got your head is a big typo in this page of the book.

373
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,672
Scott: He's like, shut up.

374
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,580
Rym: We're trying to do dual witch.

375
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,140
Rym: And this happened.

376
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,610
Scott: What do we do?

377
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,238
Scott: What are you calling me?

378
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:04,980
Rym: All right, it may be a low energy show, but it's time for things of the day.

379
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,325
Scott: My thing today is rims.

380
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:09,840
Scott: headache may grow large anyway, so here we go.

381
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,419
Scott: Check this out.

382
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,560
Scott: This is what I've always wanted.

383
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:14,820
Scott: And I think this actually proves a lot of points I've made in the past.

384
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:17,920
Scott: This is a thing called eight button Starcraft.

385
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:24,299
Scott: And this guy basically made a mod for Starcraft and it adds this little interface to the top of the screen with eight buttons on it.

386
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:32,000
Scott: And basically what the eight buttons are is there's one button for each of the major unit types in whatever race you've picked.

387
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:36,420
Scott: And there are three buttons below that, which is attack, retreat and expand.

388
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,480
Scott: So you pick a, you know, a type of creatures.

389
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:48,880
Scott: Let's say you're the Zerg, you pick Hydra list and then you pick expand and it'll just automatically expand your base in the most efficient way possible and build Hydra lists.

390
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:54,460
Scott: And then you click attack and it'll make the Hydra list that you have attack in the most efficient way possible.

391
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,480
Scott: And you don't have to do any micro or anything.

392
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:00,600
Rym: And I want nothing more than to play this.

393
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,858
Rym: I don't think I'll even bother playing regular Starcraft if I get my hands on.

394
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:04,678
Scott: this is totally awesome.

395
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,531
Scott: This is the way to go.

396
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:18,280
Rym: Uh, it proves the underlying problem with Starcraft and most RTS is I would argue the entire genre of RTS is as we know them, popular RTS is at least they're not strategy games.

397
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,500
Rym: They're, they're like fighting games.

398
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Rym: You're just, you have this top down view, but they're not that much different from a Soul Calibur or a Street Fighter.

399
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,780
Scott: Well, the difference is, right, is that you're the, the meaning, there are meaningful decisions, right?

400
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,559
Scott: When do you attack?

401
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,300
Scott: When do you retreat?

402
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,280
Scott: When do you expand?

403
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,540
Scott: How much, you know, that sort of thing.

404
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,880
Rym: There are meaningful decisions to be made, but there are perfectly optimal strategies to enact things like kiting.

405
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,979
Rym: The fact that I know exactly what I want to do.

406
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:52,640
Rym: I want this guy to, you know, do this thing, but the only way to make the game do that is to go click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, You have to physically do it.

407
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,340
Scott: And physically doing it is a solved problem.

408
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,916
Scott: There is a perfect way to execute and it's simply a matter of, can you execute it with your hands?

409
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,360
Scott: You know, otherwise, even though you made the correct decision, it won't happen.

410
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:08,000
Rym: DDR is the same way in some regards.

411
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,280
Rym: There are some songs I'm trying to beat all the max songs on maniac.

412
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:15,620
Rym: And there are some of them that I know exactly what the pattern is.

413
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,699
Rym: I simply cannot make my feet move fast enough to execute it.

414
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,920
Rym: Did I solve it somehow?

415
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:23,040
Scott: DDR is a game of dexterity.

416
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,660
Scott: It doesn't have the word strategy in the title.

417
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:30,400
Scott: Ah, but, but at least, at least it's dance dance revolution.

418
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:31,500
Scott: It's a rhythm game.

419
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,740
Scott: It claims that you need to be able to dance and have rhythm.

420
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,957
Scott: Starcraft is a game we have to craft and have strategy.

421
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:40,199
Rym: At no point do I craft stars.

422
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,139
Scott: No, that's, you know, play Minecraft instead.

423
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,719
Scott: You'll craft a mine real quick.

424
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:50,460
Scott: Um, but yeah, that's, you know, that, I guess it's not even just that.

425
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,639
Rym: It's not that like, if it were like Counter-Strike, I solved, I know what to do.

426
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:56,939
Rym: Shoot the guy in the head, shoot the other guy in the head.

427
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:59,320
Rym: But the execution of it is difficult.

428
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:02,360
Rym: And that's, what's interesting because the, the, I tried.

429
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,180
Scott: Well, but the thing that's the thing is the decision.

430
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:05,520
Scott: There is no decision to be made.

431
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,860
Scott: The decision is always shoot the guy in the head, right?

432
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:13,960
Rym: You know, it's, it's one of the other hair, but there's also the decision making aspects like go around the corner or not.

433
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:17,120
Rym: Do we storm the front or do we circle around back?

434
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,960
Scott: But the execution of that is trivially easy.

435
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,679
Rym: Circle around back.

436
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,480
Scott: The execution of circling around back is trivially easy.

437
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,220
Rym: No, not necessarily.

438
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,957
Rym: I mean, depending on.

439
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,680
Scott: You walk, you walk in the right direction.

440
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,337
Rym: No playing against good players or on a good team, like on a non-pub server, like 8v8.

441
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:38,172
Rym: Lately, I've been joining a lot of the pub tournament servers where they run tournament rules, but there's still a pub and it's much.

442
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,571
Rym: Counter-Strike is a whole different game on that.

443
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:46,240
Rym: If I were younger, I think I would consider planning again because it was such a different experience, whatever.

444
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,739
Rym: But like even the execution of circling around back, like what rate do you go?

445
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,879
Rym: You know, cover fire someone covering the hallway while someone moves up to the next cover.

446
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,520
Rym: It's very procedural.

447
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:03,420
Rym: There's a lot of very kind of not necessarily tedious, but there's a lot of dexterity based minimal elements bit by bit by bit along the way.

448
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:15,098
Rym: It's not trivial to execute even something as simple as storm the front, but in Starcraft, not only do you have to do all of that, but it's boring as fuck and completely uninteresting to kites.

449
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,678
Rym: That is not fun to do.

450
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:20,160
Rym: That is an artifact of old games that didn't have the ability to have good.

451
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:29,800
Scott: I actually saw some Blizzard, some chat, some Blizzard person made some comments and they were like, they basically ought to summarize it and paraphrase.

452
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:31,460
Scott: They know there's micro.

453
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,059
Scott: They know they could eliminate it.

454
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,398
Scott: They thought about eliminating it.

455
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:38,160
Scott: They, you know, they probably even made some tests where it was eliminated.

456
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,160
Scott: But, uh, but South Korea, well, no, but they basically said, look, no arts.

457
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,375
Scott: Yes.

458
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,360
Scott: That ever eliminated micro as increased sales dramatically.

459
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:48,238
Scott: So why should we do it?

460
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,799
Rym: See now what I would argue what they should have done.

461
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:52,620
Scott: They should make a different game.

462
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:55,537
Scott: That is, you know, they should let Starcraft be.

463
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:55,980
Scott: it's hard.

464
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:56,838
Scott: Starcraft self.

465
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:57,400
Scott: Exactly.

466
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,579
Scott: They should make, they should make Warcraft for an arts.

467
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:00,746
Scott: Yes.

468
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,498
Scott: That's easy.

469
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:04,257
Scott: You know, that doesn't have micro doesn't have micro.

470
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:05,553
Scott: Exactly.

471
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,440
Rym: Because the thing is Starcraft is a legitimate kind of game.

472
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:16,300
Rym: And while I don't like it and I will make arguments as to why it's not a good game from a lot of perspectives, it's a perfectly viable, popular game among hardcore people.

473
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,117
Rym: There's nothing wrong with that.

474
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:26,600
Rym: But the fact that that is the only direction that RTS have gone in the last decade really bothers me because it's an unexplored there's that we did all paddle about this.

475
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,280
Rym: It packs on, you know, why don't you just do something cool?

476
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:31,140
Rym: Do something interesting.

477
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,960
Rym: Why is no one making an RTS that isn't just the, oh my God, spam click fast.

478
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,195
Rym: He, he, he, he, he, he.

479
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,139
Scott: Anyway, that's my thing of the day.

480
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:40,060
Rym: That's your thing of the day.

481
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,180
Rym: So this is, I think, pretty cool.

482
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,998
Rym: I love it when people make, like remember that, uh, silent star wars, the silent movie star wars.

483
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:49,420
Rym: Yeah.

484
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:49,838
Rym: Yeah.

485
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:50,638
Rym: Well, this is like that.

486
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,380
Rym: It's a fifties horror sci-fi movie trailer to inception.

487
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,339
Rym: That is actually crazily well done.

488
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,580
Rym: It's in the style and it's actually accurate to the movie.

489
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,000
Rym: However, spoilers.

490
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,200
Rym: Okay.

491
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,597
Rym: Yeah.

492
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,620
Rym: Old movie trailers spoiled the shit out of things.

493
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,180
Rym: And in true fashion, this spoils the shit out of inception.

494
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,560
Scott: Alrighty.

495
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:12,260
Scott: So the meta moment.

496
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:13,538
Rym: Oh, you said it.

497
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,300
Rym: Usually I say it anyway.

498
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,159
Scott: They've met a moment.

499
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,180
Rym: So we got no conventions until MAGFest.

500
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:19,994
Scott: Are you sure?

501
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:24,600
Rym: Uh, what other convention are we going to after MAGFest?

502
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,369
Scott: It's good.

503
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,716
Rym: Magfest is in like January or February.

504
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,528
Rym: All right.

505
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,578
Scott: So that's, that's soon.

506
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,000
Scott: But there's also holidays, which means there'll be holiday type events.

507
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,338
Scott: Who knows?

508
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:36,300
Scott: Um, there is a book club.

509
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,699
Scott: The book club book is currently world war Z.

510
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,740
Rym: I don't want to read that by max Brooks.

511
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,658
Rym: You realize since you picked that book, I've read three other books because my brain is like, don't, I don't want her.

512
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:49,600
Scott: I haven't started.

513
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,159
Scott: I haven't started it yet, but I got it.

514
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:51,959
Scott: I'm going to read it soon.

515
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,719
Rym: I just read, I just like blew through the second lock lab or a book.

516
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:55,938
Scott: I'm going to read it soon.

517
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:56,455
Scott: All right.

518
00:24:56,781 --> 00:25:01,480
Rym: You know, I haven't started, but whatever, by the way, as a total aside for book club interested listeners.

519
00:25:01,862 --> 00:25:05,239
Rym: Remember the lives of Locke Lamora and how we weren't, you know, we'll see where it goes with the sequel.

520
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,060
Rym: I will not spoil anything.

521
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,200
Rym: The sequel proves that the series is not bullshit.

522
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:10,700
Scott: Okay.

523
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,119
Rym: The sequel picks up where it should have picked up.

524
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:17,400
Rym: And the problem that is introduced is the problem that needed to be introduced.

525
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:18,099
Scott: Okay.

526
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:20,760
Rym: I'll leave it at that, but I was pleased already.

527
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,840
Scott: So, uh, also, you know, we have a forum and a website from recruit.com.

528
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,940
Rym: Oh, we were scraping the bottom of the barrel for meta.

529
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,580
Scott: Now you should go to it, you know, just cause people don't.

530
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:35,020
Rym: No, I, there's been a recent change in the past at a con.

531
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,500
Rym: Someone would come and be like, Oh my God, you're Rym and Scott.

532
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:37,898
Rym: Hey.

533
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:40,059
Rym: And usually when we ask, Hey, are you in the forum?

534
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,495
Rym: They're like, I read it, but I don't pose.

535
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:46,040
Rym: this past weekend.

536
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,200
Rym: Almost everyone I ran into had a forum account and had posted at least a couple of times.

537
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:51,424
Rym: Whoa.

538
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,194
Scott: All right.

539
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:52,830
Scott: Yeah.

540
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,580
Scott: Go to forum.

541
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:54,899
Scott: And we also have a Twitter account.

542
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:55,679
Scott: It's GeekNights.

543
00:25:56,142 --> 00:26:01,305
Scott: And, uh, we have a thing that's automatically tweeting out links to old episodes once a day.

544
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,659
Scott: So I know cause we only do two a week.

545
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:05,560
Scott: Maybe you're a relatively new listener.

546
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:07,619
Scott: You want to catch up on old shows.

547
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:11,340
Scott: It'll just, it'll, you know, sort of alert you of an old episode once a day.

548
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:15,380
Scott: So you can use that to, uh, you know, keep track of your potting or whatever.

549
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,000
Scott: And I'm gonna, someone requested.

550
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,995
Scott: I make some RSS feeds.

551
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,659
Scott: So I'm going to get around to that and it'll be, it'll be all good.

552
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,280
Rym: Yeah.

553
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:25,860
Rym: However, you should bear in mind that we've been doing GeekNights since 2005.

554
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,740
Scott: Some of the old episodes, it's random.

555
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:29,459
Scott: Remember, I'm not picking these by hand.

556
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,740
Scott: Quality may vary, will vary greatly.

557
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,520
Rym: You might get the masturbation episode.

558
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,000
Rym: Take a look at the title before you, uh, you might get the, the first episode we ever put up on Halloween.

559
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,532
Scott: Yeah.

560
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:45,040
Scott: You might 2005 look at the episode title before you choose whether or not you can listen to it or not.

561
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,339
Rym: I realized in the opening of the show, we should probably start saying the year.

562
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:49,797
Rym: Why?

563
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,380
Rym: Because we don't say that.

564
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,879
Rym: And now we've had how many?

565
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,080
Rym: It's October something.

566
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:56,319
Scott: That's fine.

567
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,600
Rym: You can kind of tell by the audio quality, I guess.

568
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:01,460
Scott: I don't think it's a problem.

569
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:02,539
Rym: It might be.

570
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,040
Rym: We're like, yeah, we're going to be at Otakon next weekend.

571
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:07,319
Rym: We're doing these panels.

572
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,859
Scott: Anyone, you know, we say we're going to be at Otakon next weekend and someone goes, doesn't go to the Otakon website.

573
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,879
Scott: They deserve what they get.

574
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:19,660
Rym: Oh, there's some funny, this is total inside baseball.

575
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:21,299
Rym: I haven't told Scott yet.

576
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,540
Rym: I was talking to Daryl Surratt and he pointed out something funny in the Otakon forum.

577
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,598
Scott: He pointed out to me.

578
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,237
Rym: Oh, well then I'll leave it at that.

579
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:27,997
Scott: All right.

580
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:29,600
Rym: So boggle boggle.

581
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:30,818
Scott: Oh yeah.

582
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,620
Scott: So, you know, I was thinking about the game boggle.

583
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:34,800
Scott: Cause I saw it somewhere.

584
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,798
Rym: No, no, no, no, no.

585
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:42,259
Rym: We basically, you were like, we had the boggle boggle episode and we needed something, you know, we needed something to rhyme.

586
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,639
Rym: And I was like boggle boggle.

587
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,380
Scott: Is that a remember?

588
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,451
Rym: That's how we decided.

589
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:47,039
Rym: I have the chat.

590
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:49,340
Rym: I can pull up the transcript of the conversation.

591
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,519
Scott: I did see a game of boggle recently though.

592
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:54,280
Rym: Are you sure that wasn't confirmation bias?

593
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,877
Rym: Because if it wasn't, then you know what it is.

594
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,340
Scott: Confirmation unbiased.

595
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,338
Rym: Synchronicity.

596
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:08,060
Scott: Anyway, so boggle, it's a game where you take a bunch of cubes, they have letters on them and you shake up the cubes inside a little plastic box.

597
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:18,300
Scott: And then you take the lid off and you've got a grid of letters and you try to find as many words by, you know, that are made up of adjacent letters as you can before the timer runs out.

598
00:28:19,342 --> 00:28:19,554
Rym: Adjacent.

599
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,280
Scott: Uh, no, I thought you could also go diagonally.

600
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,380
Rym: I always played orthogonal.

601
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,199
Scott: I thought diagonal was also an option.

602
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,118
Rym: If it was then.

603
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:37,100
Rym: Anyway, I only ever played boggle like a handful of times when I was a little kid because my grandma had it laying around her house and my brother and I would find it, play it for like a little while, get bored and then move on to other things.

604
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:48,400
Scott: I kind of like boggle better than a word search, like a straight up word search on paper that you buy in a book because you know, the word searches that are done on paper because they crafted by a human.

605
00:28:48,942 --> 00:28:51,454
Scott: You know, there's sort of, I think some of them are automated.

606
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:54,360
Scott: now, but you know, the old ones used to be hand human made.

607
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:56,440
Scott: You can sort of like figure them out.

608
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,809
Scott: It's like, Oh, there's obviously a word.

609
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,260
Scott: there is obviously a word there.

610
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:13,160
Rym: Now, now, now when I was in middle school, a lot of times if there's a substitute teacher or like in, you know, crappy teachers, they'd, they'd have an assignment like make a word search with the 10 like bro cab terms from whatever and then trade them with other people.

611
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:22,860
Rym: I would basically make mine consists of nothing but all of the words mixed up, spelled slightly incorrectly and have no correct spellings anywhere.

612
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:26,980
Rym: So what I would always do if you're going to point that out, I would make it legit.

613
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,059
Rym: There were, they were all in there except one.

614
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:31,639
Rym: I'd always leave one out because I'm a Dick.

615
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:37,620
Scott: But yeah, you know, boggle is like, it's not a fancy game.

616
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:39,580
Scott: It's not a hard, really hard game.

617
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,299
Rym: It's barely a multiplayer game.

618
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:43,680
Rym: At best it's multiplayer in the same way.

619
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,580
Rym: That's a racing game in the same way that how long does it take you to run a mile?

620
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,959
Rym: It takes me this long to run a mile.

621
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,040
Scott: I guess I win, but you know, it is actually sort of a quality for what it is is quality, right?

622
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:56,620
Scott: You actually need a big vocabulary.

623
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:59,740
Scott: You got to have quick eyeball searching skills.

624
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,619
Scott: You know, you got to, you know, it's actually a skill based game and the best person does win unless you cheat.

625
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:15,000
Rym: But at the same time, it primarily, I mean, I guess if we're going to have a moral to this episode, it's that games that appear on the surface to be very similar actually test very different skills.

626
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:15,820
Rym: If you don't pay attention.

627
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,480
Rym: That's absolutely true, which is true of all gaming.

628
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,838
Rym: Yeah.

629
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,300
Scott: Boggles boggles prime.

630
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:27,080
Scott: You know, boggle test vocabulary, but primarily it tests, you know, quick looking Final Fantasy tests patients.

631
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,839
Rym: World of Warcraft test boredom.

632
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:37,980
Rym: I think they both test patients, but boggle really is just, you know, do you have good?

633
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,197
Rym: Are you not dyslexic?

634
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:43,780
Rym: And do you have a large vocabulary of like three to five letter words?

635
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,435
Scott: Well, I mean, sometimes you can find really big words and boggling.

636
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:51,500
Rym: pretty rarely, though, because of the statistical, like the way the dice would fall.

637
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,980
Scott: That is one thing is that each die only has six letters on it.

638
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:59,540
Scott: And so you're not really going to get a whole bunch of alphabet every time.

639
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:06,459
Scott: It would be cooler if you had a boggle where each die was actually a 26 cider, you know, and that way you never knew what was going to show up.

640
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:12,579
Rym: Not only is that not a perfect shape, but there's basically unless you made it just a cylinder, you just digitize it.

641
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:13,259
Rym: Yeah, you could.

642
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:14,400
Rym: And it's digital online.

643
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:14,899
Rym: And you know what?

644
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,980
Rym: It looks like it emulates the original physical game.

645
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:17,458
Rym: Really?

646
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,445
Rym: The one I found is

647
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:29,560
Scott: the thing is, well, the reason that you need to emulate the region that they did that in the original game is not only because the physical limitations of dice to fit into the slots, but because that way you can get a nice mix of vowels and common consonants.

648
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:31,699
Scott: So you can actually get some words every time.

649
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:41,439
Scott: If you did exactly if you did 26, you know, ciders, then it's possible you get a fuck ton of cues and nothing to do with them and unplayable boggle figure.

650
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,039
Rym: Random aside, do you know what?

651
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,720
Rym: There are test symbols in the stock market that are not real, but have real market data.

652
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:47,514
Scott: OK.

653
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:48,813
Rym: And one of them is ZVZT.

654
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:50,134
Scott: OK.

655
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:53,715
Scott: So can I buy some ZVZT?

656
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:57,200
Rym: If you had an account that would let you.

657
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,838
Rym: Yes, you could.

658
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:01,140
Scott: And would I would actually be worth anything now so I can buy it for zero?

659
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:01,558
Scott: Yes.

660
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:05,800
Scott: I can just send in a thing that says I want to buy all this and it would just happen.

661
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,440
Rym: It's a little more complicated than that because there's no limit on ZVZT.

662
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,400
Scott: Can I buy all the boggle?

663
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,380
Rym: But I'd say boggle is really just a primitive form of more modern games like bookworm.

664
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,320
Scott: Well, I mean, bookworm adventures is pretty much boggle plus worms.

665
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,840
Rym: I really liked bookworm.

666
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,200
Rym: I played a fuck ton.

667
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,238
Scott: Well, there were different ones.

668
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,119
Scott: There was the there was the straight up original, but then there was the adventure questing one where you actually fought monsters.

669
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:32,139
Rym: I didn't play that.

670
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:39,940
Scott: Basically, what you would do is you would the worm would go up to a monster and you'd have to get enough words and big enough ones to kill the monster without getting hurt.

671
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,459
Scott: And then you would move on a little bit more.

672
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,618
Rym: So it's like typing of the dead.

673
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:44,117
Scott: Sort of.

674
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,360
Scott: Yeah.

675
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:45,379
Scott: But it's bookworm of the dead.

676
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,020
Scott: And, you know, there are levels.

677
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,799
Scott: There was experience and levels and leveling up and that sort of thing.

678
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:53,020
Scott: But it was sort of tacked on like puzzle quest.

679
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,640
Scott: You know, it wasn't the core.

680
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,719
Rym: People have made games like that.

681
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,920
Rym: It's a neat concept, though.

682
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,480
Rym: I think a lot of people have fantasized.

683
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,440
Rym: Like I play involved battle balls, right?

684
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:00,840
Scott: Yeah.

685
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:02,759
Rym: Imagine if battle balls was just battle balls.

686
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:11,260
Rym: But at the top was some like the dragon and the Mount Fuji were having this wicked, epic Pokemon looking fight that was choreographed based on how well you were doing.

687
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,278
Scott: And that's what Henry Hasserith was supposed to be.

688
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:15,952
Scott: That wasn't.

689
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:19,180
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, I actually think Boggle is a good game.

690
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,200
Scott: It's a good game to have.

691
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:28,450
Scott: If you know, if you want to whip something out really quickly and you're a very wordy kind of, you know, linguistic, lingual file kind of person, you know, Boggle is a good one.

692
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,180
Scott: It's small.

693
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,780
Scott: It's portable.

694
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:31,080
Scott: I think they even have travel Boggle.

695
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:33,298
Scott: And it's actually a game of skill.

696
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:44,732
Rym: It's also a good game to make your friends feel really stupid, especially if you've practiced, because if you break it open and figure out what's on all the dice, there are certain words that are very likely to be there and words that

697
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:49,920
Scott: are also words that people that are likely to be there that are words that people are unlikely to know.

698
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:50,499
Rym: Yeah.

699
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:51,939
Scott: And you could be like, yes, a word.

700
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,215
Scott: And then what you do is you just write your words down on paper while you're playing the game.

701
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,960
Scott: And at the very end, because of the timer, you can't dispute while the timer's running.

702
00:33:59,344 --> 00:34:00,799
Scott: You could dispute after you're done.

703
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,059
Scott: And then someone would be like, that word doesn't count.

704
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,605
Scott: And then you get.

705
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:04,880
Scott: then you get the dictionary out.

706
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:05,220
Scott: Right.

707
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:11,739
Scott: And actually, that's what I kind of like about Boggle is that any challenges or anything weird like that only matter at the end when you have time.

708
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,539
Scott: And it's not a pain in the ass to figure them out.

709
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:21,719
Rym: Unlike I don't mind Scrabble and the way it does it, because the Scrabble, it's more like the challenge in football or something like, do I challenge it or not?

710
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,598
Rym: I have to make a call.

711
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:23,638
Scott: I like that.

712
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:32,239
Scott: But, you know, it still interrupts the game in Scrabble, which is I don't like the penalties not big enough for getting caught and the reward for catching someone is not big enough.

713
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,000
Scott: That's true.

714
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,320
Rym: And in fact, it should be like you get punched in the face and you have to give up a foul.

715
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,760
Scott: I mean, look at football, right?

716
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,020
Scott: In football, if you challenge and you're correct, you just win.

717
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:43,320
Scott: You get your challenge, right?

718
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,900
Scott: If you're challenging, you're false.

719
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,239
Scott: You lose a time out in Scrabble.

720
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:50,018
Scott: If you challenge falsely, don't you lose a turn?

721
00:34:50,762 --> 00:34:50,911
Scott: Right.

722
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:52,119
Scott: That's a huge penalty.

723
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:55,480
Rym: Not near the end of the game where you don't have any you don't have shit to play anyway.

724
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:56,359
Scott: That's true.

725
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:05,399
Scott: But if you challenge and you're if you get challenged, all that happens is you take your tiles off the board and you lose the turn.

726
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,499
Rym: Are you sure that's all that happens?

727
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:07,172
Scott: I don't know.

728
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:08,820
Scott: That's what I remember.

729
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,880
Scott: It might not be correct.

730
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,818
Scott: Someone can correct me.

731
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,260
Rym: I mean, it might be a situation like Monopoly where fucking no one knows how Monopoly is actually played.

732
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,540
Scott: The penalty for challenging needs to be less than the penalty for actually getting successfully challenged.

733
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,379
Rym: I think the penalty should be pretty high, but the penalty for being caught should be even higher.

734
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,320
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

735
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:32,520
Scott: The penalty for fucking up and getting caught should be a lot worse than the penalty for challenging falsely.

736
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,839
Scott: That way, because otherwise people are going to hesitate to challenge when they should.

737
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:38,839
Rym: So Scrabble hint.

738
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,376
Rym: Pro tip.

739
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:43,120
Rym: If you want to win at Scrabble, trick all of your friends.

740
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,900
Rym: Be like, yeah, let's use the OED, the Oxford English Dictionary on a bridge.

741
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:49,060
Rym: And they'll probably be like, yeah, whatever.

742
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:50,620
Rym: We don't care what dictionary we'll just play.

743
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,160
Rym: And then just fucking make words up.

744
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,379
Rym: Odds are they're in there.

745
00:35:54,801 --> 00:36:03,240
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I used L-A-Z-E-R and I was like, I was like, I looked up and it was like, you know, it was like archaic something, something.

746
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,139
Rym: It was Lazar.

747
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,080
Rym: And then Lazar was an archaic form of Lazar.

748
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,080
Rym: And I forget the definition, but it's got to just spell those.

749
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,380
Scott: There's no way that those are in the Scrabble dictionary.

750
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:18,440
Scott: They're only in the OED because it's got every fucking word and every root of every English word imaginable.

751
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:18,668
Scott: Yeah.

752
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,040
Scott: But also you just write any old thing in there and you'll you'll get a point.

753
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,200
Rym: You want to win at Scrabble.

754
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:27,288
Rym: You've pretty much got a big vocabulary, but everyone assumes that's the only thing you need.

755
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,100
Scott: That is actually the least important skill.

756
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,920
Scott: You need to memorize these very specific two letter words for Scrabble.

757
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:34,339
Rym: Not every two letter word.

758
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,780
Rym: There's only twenty six times twenty six and most of those aren't even words.

759
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:39,400
Scott: Yeah.

760
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,080
Scott: You know, you have to memorize all of the two letter words and then you can win.

761
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:45,360
Scott: You'll have to be way better at Scrabble than anybody.

762
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,999
Rym: All the two letter words, if you can.

763
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,399
Rym: Pretty much every weird three letter word.

764
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:54,880
Scott: And every word that has like you, you know, because there's a lot of them, like you, you eat, right?

765
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,456
Scott: Is not a word.

766
00:36:55,844 --> 00:36:56,920
Scott: There's all sorts of crazy.

767
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,600
Rym: Well, that's the word in Spanish.

768
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,080
Rym: Yeah.

769
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:05,399
Scott: But I mean, there's all sorts of crazy things that are words that you wouldn't realize are words, you know, that you can score big points on.

770
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:12,260
Scott: And because they're not a word that people use every day, most people would never even use them in Scrabble unless they're Scrabble players.

771
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:19,659
Scott: And that's what bothers me is that Boggle is actually a game of mostly your actual vocabulary because it's all about speed.

772
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:24,400
Scott: So you can't do a two letter word in Boggle, I don't think.

773
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:30,800
Scott: But Scrabble isn't about just your regular old everyday vocabulary and how big it is.

774
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:33,060
Scott: It's also and there's no timer either.

775
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:37,920
Scott: It's mostly about did you memorize these specific Scrabble things?

776
00:37:38,141 --> 00:37:42,919
Scott: So it's like even if you're better at vocabulary, you might lose to someone who's just better at Scrabble.

777
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,660
Rym: Now, to be fair, a lot of games are like that.

778
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:53,500
Rym: Even if someone's really smart, if I've just played Puerto Rico a shit ton more than them, I am much more likely to win Puerto Rico because I know Puerto Rico specific things.

779
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,200
Scott: That's true.

780
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,960
Rym: But Scrabble, I guess, just tricks a lot of people who think like I used to think I never played Scrabble.

781
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,540
Rym: I was like, oh, I have an awesome vocabulary.

782
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,720
Rym: I'll fucking rock this game.

783
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:03,819
Rym: And instead of rocking, I got wrecked.

784
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:07,120
Rym: I mean, neither one of those words on the triple word score.

785
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,238
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's a general problem when you have a game of knowledge versus a game of skill.

786
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,640
Rym: Scrabble, there's some decisions to be made, but isn't a vocabulary game by definition, a game of skill or game of knowledge.

787
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:20,258
Rym: How many words do you know?

788
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,460
Scott: Well, no, because in Boggle has the skill of quickly recognizing them because the timer is involved.

789
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:27,520
Rym: I think knowing the words is equally important.

790
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,100
Scott: It is equally important, but there is a skill factor.

791
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:33,620
Scott: But, you know, Scrabble is just mostly knowledge.

792
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,420
Scott: It's like 90 percent knowledge, 10 percent skill of picking the right spots.

793
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,438
Rym: But see, I wanted it.

794
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:45,180
Rym: I guess my my assumption when I first played Scrabble as a kid was I assumed that it was testing just knowledge.

795
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,660
Rym: How great is your vocabulary?

796
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,759
Rym: Yeah, I got wrecked because it tested these other skills I didn't think about.

797
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,919
Rym: Yeah, of course, back then I thought Monopoly was a good game.

798
00:38:53,961 --> 00:39:02,220
Scott: The other thing about Scrabble is that it does have a luck factor, which, you know, you don't you don't think is significant because there's so many tiles in the bag and you keep drawing.

799
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:04,140
Scott: But it's actually pretty significant.

800
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:10,399
Scott: Someone always gets screwed with useless letters and someone else always gets a really good word and it's just complete luck.

801
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,999
Scott: Whereas in Boggle, you're all looking at the same thing.

802
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:18,699
Scott: So you could you know, you have equal chances of winning, which I think is actually makes a little bit more fair.

803
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,100
Rym: Scrabble also has the the mechanics of the board itself, and you've got the strategy of blocking or building out.

804
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,184
Scott: Yeah, but it's so.

805
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:31,139
Scott: it's so obvious because the only thing you have to you basically do whatever move you can find that gets you the most points.

806
00:39:31,683 --> 00:39:33,675
Scott: And the only thing is, well, you go in order.

807
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,300
Rym: Only question is the same strategy as Carcassonne.

808
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:39,580
Rym: First, do the most for yourself.

809
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:45,680
Rym: If you cannot do enough for yourself for it to matter, go down a notch and hurt someone else as much as you can.

810
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,500
Scott: You can't really hurt someone else in Scrabble.

811
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,460
Scott: What you can do is you can look at their tiles and figure out what you can look at their tiles unless you're cheating.

812
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,100
Scott: But you can go into the spot that's the easiest to go to make it hard for anyone else to go.

813
00:39:58,141 --> 00:40:08,180
Scott: And you can also say, oh, this move is three points less than that move, but it makes it really hard for anyone to use that triple word score, which it will otherwise be made available.

814
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:14,339
Scott: So I'll do that to, you know, make it harder for other players rather than, oh, man, this move gets me a ton of points.

815
00:40:14,483 --> 00:40:14,979
Scott: But you know what?

816
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,980
Scott: It puts this E right out there where anyone can get a triple word score way easy.

817
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:21,420
Scott: So it actually adds up to less points in total for me.

818
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,760
Rym: You know, left right actually matters a lot in Scrabble, too.

819
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:25,360
Rym: It does.

820
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:27,800
Scott: Going first, you get the double word score right at the beginning.

821
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:30,120
Rym: You know, that's not a double word score.

822
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:30,858
Rym: That's just a star.

823
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:32,260
Scott: No, that's double word score.

824
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,100
Rym: No, it's not.

825
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:34,440
Scott: Yeah, it is colored the same.

826
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,699
Rym: You're not supposed to count it like that.

827
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,820
Scott: Actually, you are really.

828
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:38,599
Scott: I'm pretty sure you are.

829
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:39,399
Rym: Let's look it up right now.

830
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:52,400
Rym: A player begins the game by placing a word on the star square at the center of the board.

831
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,180
Rym: The star square acts as a double word score.

832
00:40:55,541 --> 00:41:00,460
Rym: I said the star square does not act as a double word score for subsequent players.

833
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:01,079
Rym: So you were right.

834
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:02,319
Scott: Yes, that's correct.

835
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,500
Scott: Whoever goes first gets a free double word score.

836
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:08,319
Scott: And then it's really hard to get a double word score immediately off of that.

837
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:11,359
Scott: So and it's like a two player game.

838
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,460
Scott: Then that's in a four player game.

839
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:16,380
Scott: It actually sort of balances out, but not in a two player game.

840
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:20,499
Scott: Going first is a pretty good advantage, depending on the tiles you initially draw to.

841
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:27,870
Scott: If you initially draw shit tiles that could actually screw you because your first word will be like at or something like that, you know.

842
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:40,989
Rym: Honestly, though, Scrabble aside, I mean, everyone knows Scrabble, but a lot of my favorite games in the genre of knowledge and words and that sort of stuff, I guess not just knowledge, because that would also include like Trivial Pursuit and all that BS.

843
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:41,968
Scott: Yeah, I don't like that.

844
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:45,590
Rym: We should do a show on that at some point, but that's way out of the scope of this.

845
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,810
Scott: Yeah, we're looking at word games here.

846
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:52,890
Rym: We got some obscure or at least relatively obscure games of that ilk that I don't think many of you have played that you can get a hold of.

847
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,209
Rym: They're actually pretty fun, like like Probe.

848
00:41:55,591 --> 00:42:00,609
Scott: Well, Probe is this game that like my grandma had in the closet that like my mom had when she was a kid.

849
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,570
Rym: And basically your grandma probed you in the closet.

850
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:03,655
Scott: It's a really.

851
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,290
Scott: it's a probe is great for making jokes about probes.

852
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,910
Scott: It's this really old game that I don't think has been reprinted in forever.

853
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:13,430
Scott: And what it is, it's versus Hangman.

854
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:13,701
Scott: Right.

855
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:16,610
Scott: So you make a word and you added these cards.

856
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:24,629
Scott: You have a deck of cards with the alphabet in it and you make a word in a little tray and you have to get other people's words one letter at a time.

857
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:25,769
Scott: Like Hangman.

858
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:31,890
Scott: And you can actually use these different blank cards to trick people into thinking your word.

859
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:32,770
Rym: That's the best mechanic.

860
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,410
Scott: The word is longer or shorter.

861
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,190
Rym: So say my word is anal.

862
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:42,190
Rym: OK, I could put up to two of these blanks either in front of or behind my word.

863
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:42,339
Scott: Yep.

864
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:49,430
Scott: So you put one letter and you put one blank in front and people say banal and you go fail or they can get you.

865
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,829
Rym: They can you know, they're trying to figure out your word and they're like, hey, and they see the A and they're not quite sure what it is.

866
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,610
Rym: Or they can guess you got a blank and they can get you that way.

867
00:42:57,671 --> 00:42:59,309
Rym: But then you only have to reveal one of your blanks.

868
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,199
Scott: Yep, it's very.

869
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:02,490
Scott: I like probe a lot.

870
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,205
Scott: And I think that.

871
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,609
Scott: OK, I think it's really good for making jokes.

872
00:43:10,074 --> 00:43:10,286
Rym: It is.

873
00:43:10,752 --> 00:43:13,490
Rym: It was published in 1964.

874
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,069
Scott: God damn.

875
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,869
Rym: We actually played this a lot at RIT.

876
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,310
Scott: I don't think we played it that much.

877
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:18,567
Rym: We did.

878
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,229
Rym: There was that one.

879
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,370
Rym: It was but it was around after tribes kind of died in colony.

880
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:29,470
Rym: Remember, we'd all go into separate rooms and sit on dictionary sites for like 10 minutes coming up with the craziest fucking.

881
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,050
Scott: Yeah, we did that like a couple of times.

882
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,769
Scott: Not a lot.

883
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,323
Rym: We played it a lot for a while, but then we stopped.

884
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:37,850
Rym: like we played it a lot for like this three week span and then we stopped playing it.

885
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:38,749
Rym: Never really played it again.

886
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,750
Scott: Yeah, I still have it.

887
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,450
Scott: It's in my apartment.

888
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,529
Scott: We should we should play it.

889
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:45,210
Scott: We can definitely play it if anyone else out there wants to.

890
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:49,290
Scott: I'm sure you can find the rules on the Internet pretty easily and you know, to make it yourself.

891
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:51,178
Scott: I mean, you don't really need.

892
00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:53,790
Scott: you can just take pieces of paper and make this game.

893
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,350
Rym: Why don't we just make this digitally?

894
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:57,890
Rym: It's a game mechanics or fair game.

895
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:58,869
Scott: It's trivial.

896
00:43:59,712 --> 00:44:00,950
Scott: It's so easy to make this game.

897
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,150
Scott: It's just versus hangman.

898
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,910
Rym: I got to code a bunch of Java shit at work.

899
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,870
Rym: Maybe I'll and what you do is maybe I'll write this just to remember Java.

900
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,950
Scott: All you really need to know is the scoring mechanism.

901
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:12,170
Scott: And you could probably come up with a better scoring mechanism than the official one.

902
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:13,370
Scott: Probably.

903
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,141
Rym: Probably.

904
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:17,230
Scott: And then you just play multiple rounds and see what's the best score.

905
00:44:17,532 --> 00:44:19,130
Scott: It's good, though, with four players, right?

906
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,130
Scott: Because you have to guess against a person you can't just guess all about.

907
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,550
Rym: Well, only one person on board game geek is a fan of this game.

908
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:31,268
Scott: I think it'll be actually better than to do versus Wheel of Fortune than to do versus pro.

909
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:33,269
Rym: You know what I've got laying around?

910
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,630
Rym: I've got a board game version of Wheel of Fortune.

911
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,570
Scott: Yeah, there's also board game Jeopardy, which I've played back in the past.

912
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,410
Scott: I prefer video game Wheel of Fortune.

913
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:46,390
Scott: The only thing the only problem with video game Wheel of Fortune is that they all have the built in puzzles and you memorize them all.

914
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,449
Scott: You need to actually get one that we can load up.

915
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,150
Rym: Mine came with a lot of puzzles and an incredibly surprisingly complex mechanism.

916
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,830
Scott: Yeah, the other thing with board game Wheel of Fortune is that it's sort of like Clue where you have to close your eyes and you put the puzzle in.

917
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,550
Scott: Otherwise, you can't play because you just saw the puzzle.

918
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,330
Scott: And, you know, anyone can just look through the puzzles.

919
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:06,008
Rym: And then, you know, we should start playing again.

920
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:08,290
Rym: SNES and NES Family Feud.

921
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,410
Scott: That's like the best.

922
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:18,970
Rym: There's something about the like Nintendo versions of Family Feud because they're broken enough and difficult enough to try to guess what the thing's going after.

923
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:23,130
Scott: I had Junior Jeopardy on the NES, which actually I got pretty good at.

924
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:37,948
Rym: They also because you remember also for the fact that like when you're playing Family Feud, not only is it a busted ass NES game, you're trying to like type in the word on the NES, but it's from a culture that existed in the late 80s.

925
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:43,450
Scott: I mean, the other thing the only other good thing about the video game versions of the game shows is the buzzers, right?

926
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:51,470
Scott: Because I remember playing board game Jeopardy and you had a clicker and you just click it and it would be like judgment call who click first.

927
00:45:52,091 --> 00:45:54,270
Scott: Whereas if you had the buzzer on the NES, you just push the A button.

928
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,550
Rym: See, I had an advantage in high school.

929
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,430
Rym: I got into Quiz Bowl.

930
00:45:56,691 --> 00:45:57,369
Scott: You had a turbo button?

931
00:45:57,771 --> 00:46:03,908
Rym: So no, whenever I would like want to play a game like that at home, I just borrow one of the Quiz Bowl boxes.

932
00:46:04,355 --> 00:46:04,630
Scott: Yeah.

933
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:05,489
Rym: I just take it home.

934
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,569
Rym: We had, you know, eight buzzers, four per team.

935
00:46:08,273 --> 00:46:09,750
Rym: And it showed which team, which person.

936
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:10,709
Rym: It was actually pretty good.

937
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:12,089
Scott: Yeah, it's a good thing to have.

938
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,409
Scott: You can make one of those in Arduino real easily.

939
00:46:17,091 --> 00:46:17,428
Scott: Alrighty.

940
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,289
Scott: So, yeah, Probe is definitely a good one that people have not heard of.

941
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,729
Scott: And, you know, versus Hangman is not something people think of, even though everyone's played fricking Hangman.

942
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,070
Rym: No, we played this game Probe about as long as we played Mahjong.

943
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,410
Rym: Like it was that length of infatuation.

944
00:46:31,712 --> 00:46:32,389
Scott: I think it was less.

945
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,270
Rym: No, we didn't play Mahjong that long.

946
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,770
Rym: We got sick of Mahjong by quick.

947
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,549
Rym: That was like three weeks.

948
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:39,130
Scott: The thing is, it's weird.

949
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,576
Scott: It's like Jewish Lady.

950
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:45,810
Scott: Mahjong is probably a worse game, but it's actually sort of a better game at the same time, right?

951
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,490
Scott: Because it's got this betting factor, but the game itself is kind of weird.

952
00:46:49,911 --> 00:46:54,670
Scott: But then actual Chinese Mahjong is just fucking gin rummy with a little bit extra on there.

953
00:46:55,432 --> 00:46:58,329
Scott: And so it's actually, you know, it's completely almost luck.

954
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:02,028
Rym: It's slightly better of a game than Michigan rummy.

955
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:02,393
Scott: Yeah.

956
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,249
Scott: Michigan rummy isn't much of a game at all.

957
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:04,685
Rym: Really?

958
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:05,510
Rym: It's not a game.

959
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:10,150
Scott: But Michigan rummy is a good sort of party thing because you get the bowls with the chips and you do all this weird stuff.

960
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,390
Rym: Most people only know Michigan running a good ritual.

961
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,949
Rym: I think they only know it through Tripoli.

962
00:47:14,937 --> 00:47:15,590
Scott: I never played Tripoli.

963
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:16,409
Rym: Never played Tripoli.

964
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:16,698
Rym: No.

965
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:21,250
Rym: Tripoli was actually a really fucking dumb game, but it's really popular.

966
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,490
Scott: Was it a word game?

967
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,590
Rym: Tripoli was three card games that you play.

968
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:37,889
Rym: Like first, I forget the order, but you play some card game and then with the same cards you play Michigan rummy and then in the end you do like a poker hand showdown and then you have chips for like all three parts.

969
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:38,889
Rym: It's dumb as shit.

970
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:39,347
Scott: Okay.

971
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:45,550
Scott: But yeah, the other word game that I want to talk about that a lot of people haven't played is Upwords, which is Scrabble.

972
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,049
Scott: Except you can stack out of Upwords.

973
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:50,470
Scott: I played it only a little bit because I didn't have it.

974
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,669
Rym: I was really good at Upwords.

975
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,066
Scott: Yeah.

976
00:47:52,090 --> 00:48:06,850
Scott: I mean, it's basically Scrabble, but you can stack the letters, which I think actually made it sort of better because, uh, you know, a lot of times in Scrabble you might have a great word and nowhere to put it, but in Upwords you could be like, Hey, I found a place to put it only if that E was actually an S instead.

977
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:07,848
Scott: And you're like, Oh, there we go.

978
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:08,629
Scott: All good.

979
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:17,327
Scott: It did have you get a lot more creative and you know that the fact that you could stack both increase the skill because you had to, you know, when you stack.

980
00:48:17,387 --> 00:48:23,449
Scott: the other word that you were stacking on top of still had to make sense, but at the same time you had a lot more options available to you.

981
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:28,048
Scott: So you could always, you could usually get a big word out there instead of always having to resort to a little word.

982
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:30,550
Rym: Of course it had some fiddly bits.

983
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:36,530
Rym: I mean, I think there's a limit on like stacking up to five because otherwise you're like put pot, put pot, pet, put pot, put.

984
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:43,830
Scott: And then, yeah, I mean, if I was playing, if I wrote the game of Upwords, I would say, you know, no two like letters could be stacked in the same spot.

985
00:48:44,252 --> 00:48:46,150
Rym: So I'm looking at the board game geek for that.

986
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:50,289
Rym: It's actually rated on similarly to, uh, bro, but many more people have rated it.

987
00:48:51,414 --> 00:48:53,150
Rym: It has a language dependence warning.

988
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,290
Rym: Unplayable in other languages.

989
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:56,775
Scott: Yeah.

990
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,128
Scott: I try to play in Chinese.

991
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:01,630
Scott: Yeah.

992
00:49:02,174 --> 00:49:04,490
Scott: Actually, that is kind of interesting to think about that, right?

993
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:09,670
Scott: There's all these games that are games of alphabets, but they only work because we have the English alphabet.

994
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,010
Rym: Well, many languages use a similar alphabet or the same.

995
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,289
Scott: I'm sure anyone had a Roman alphabet, but I mean, would it work in Cyrillic?

996
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,650
Rym: Uh, probably just, you have to make Cyrillic tiles.

997
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,970
Scott: That'd be, you know, I mean, there is elite Scrabble tile bag you can buy.

998
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:24,489
Scott: Yeah.

999
00:49:25,013 --> 00:49:25,810
Scott: I always wanted to buy that.

1000
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:26,230
Scott: Maybe I should.

1001
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,950
Rym: I wonder if there's a Japanese equivalent of games like Scrabble.

1002
00:49:29,573 --> 00:49:33,109
Scott: I do also wonder if there is, that'd be very interesting to see.

1003
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:33,806
Scott: Yeah.

1004
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:34,970
Scott: Japanese Scrabble.

1005
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,810
Scott: Cause it's Scrabble definitely seems like such an American thing.

1006
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:38,448
Scott: It does.

1007
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:43,250
Rym: I mean, they're, I mean, they're both like Hasbro, Milton Bradley kind of game.

1008
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:43,909
Scott: I'd be interested.

1009
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:49,309
Scott: I'd be very amazed if the history of Scrabble was that it was came from somewhere besides the United States.

1010
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:52,690
Rym: I could have come from Britain, but it doesn't feel like it.

1011
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:53,650
Scott: I don't, I don't.

1012
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:54,870
Scott: I think that's very unlikely.

1013
00:49:55,171 --> 00:49:58,910
Rym: It feels so much like one of those, like Americana games, like uncle Wiggly.

1014
00:49:59,332 --> 00:50:01,230
Scott: And it's weird because on the one hand, right.

1015
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:08,549
Scott: You'll have like regular, it's like a game that can regular old people will be like either into it or not into it.

1016
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:11,649
Scott: But also really smart people will be into it or not into it.

1017
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:14,050
Scott: You know, like people are super board game.

1018
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:19,370
Scott: People might not like it, but people who are super smart, but not board game people might really love Scrabble.

1019
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:31,228
Scott: So in 1938, architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation of an earlier game he invented called Lexico.

1020
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:32,284
Scott: Lexico.

1021
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,109
Scott: I want to play a Lexico.

1022
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:35,230
Rym: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1023
00:50:36,191 --> 00:50:38,829
Scott: Lexico sounds like a robot that lives in the Futurama world.

1024
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:46,590
Rym: But basically the game that we know as Scrabble today came from, uh, James Brunot, not, but who was from Newtown, Connecticut.

1025
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:47,368
Scott: There you go.

1026
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:48,150
Scott: Wow.

1027
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:48,607
Scott: That's close.

1028
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:49,210
Rym: Yeah.

1029
00:50:49,351 --> 00:50:50,180
Scott: Real close to what?

1030
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:51,901
Scott: I've been there.

1031
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:53,989
Scott: Geographically close.

1032
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,969
Rym: I've been to a lot of places.

1033
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:57,449
Rym: I mean, the land bridge, you know, Jersey is close.

1034
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:02,190
Scott: Anyway, do we have anything else to say about wordy games?

1035
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:05,550
Scott: I mean, do you want to talk about, uh, like cryptograms or anything stupid like that?

1036
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:06,450
Rym: I don't know.

1037
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:14,310
Rym: I, I like games like this, but at the same time I hate them because as a gamer who's played German board games now, I look at these games.

1038
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:14,930
Rym: I'm like, really?

1039
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:16,489
Rym: I'm going to play this.

1040
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,230
Rym: I'm going to just show off my vocabulary Wang.

1041
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:20,070
Scott: Yeah.

1042
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,649
Scott: I mean, that's the thing is I have this huge love hate relationship with these games.

1043
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:29,049
Scott: is that, you know, I like playing them, but I recognize they're not as good cause.

1044
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:31,650
Scott: they're knowledge games and not decision strategy games.

1045
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,850
Rym: Mostly knowledge games, but they serve a very different.

1046
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:35,218
Scott: Yes.

1047
00:51:35,813 --> 00:51:37,170
Scott: And I like Lang.

1048
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:43,390
Scott: I like using letters and stuff, but I recognize that it's stupid yet to use all these two letter words and the memorization.

1049
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:56,670
Scott: It would be much better if it was just actual real words, not that the two letter words aren't real words, but if it was, you know, testing your actual vocabulary and not some, you know, memorized vocabulary, you're never actually going to use in real life.

1050
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,950
Scott: And you know, it's, it's always, it's like back and forth kind of thing.

1051
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,842
Scott: And I guess the thing is I am, I'm at least happy they exist.

1052
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:15,410
Scott: because if you look at the shelf of crappy board games that you see at the toy store, all right, it's like, you look monopoly is terrible and all these games are terrible, but Scrabble is like, well, it's there, it's wicked popular.

1053
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:19,470
Scott: You can even buy it in any old drug store and it's actually got something to it.

1054
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:24,254
Scott: You know, at least there is a game that's popular among the normal mainstream board games.

1055
00:52:24,537 --> 00:52:25,810
Scott: that isn't just crap.

1056
00:52:25,891 --> 00:52:28,710
Scott: Like all the other ones that are, you know, and that's like, okay, good.

1057
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:33,050
Scott: We've at least got one good game in there, you know, that people are all about.

1058
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:36,550
Scott: And apples to apples is actually coming on pretty strong in that, uh, in that department as well.

1059
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,830
Scott: I saw apples to apples for sale and just like the Dwayne Reed.

1060
00:52:39,217 --> 00:52:39,407
Rym: Yeah.

1061
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:43,690
Rym: So however, apples to apples wall fun, I think is completely petered out for me.

1062
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:46,650
Rym: Dixit is a far superior game that achieves the same purpose.

1063
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,386
Scott: Absolutely.

1064
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:48,628
Rym: By removing the words.

1065
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:55,850
Scott: But I think that, uh, apples to apples, you know, could still get some play value if we had some new cards, you know, but not that many.

1066
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,130
Scott: I'd much rather play Dixit, but Dixit doesn't do the party though.

1067
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,050
Rym: There is a super Scrabble that Hasbro released.

1068
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:02,723
Scott: Really?

1069
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:03,269
Scott: What's in that?

1070
00:53:03,895 --> 00:53:05,450
Rym: There are many international versions.

1071
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:06,930
Rym: Here's one in Tagalog.

1072
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:08,309
Scott: What's Tagalog?

1073
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:09,188
Rym: Really?

1074
00:53:09,774 --> 00:53:10,310
Rym: Really, Scott?

1075
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:11,190
Rym: Really?

1076
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:12,548
Scott: What is it?

1077
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:13,348
Rym: It's a language.

1078
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:14,436
Scott: A language.

1079
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,106
Scott: where do they speak it?

1080
00:53:16,922 --> 00:53:17,050
Rym: Really?

1081
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:17,909
Scott: In Tag?

1082
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:19,409
Scott: I mean, there's no place called Tag.

1083
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:26,310
Rym: Anyway, Super Scrabble is relatively recent and I didn't know about it.

1084
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,088
Rym: I'm going to look into it.

1085
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:27,969
Scott: What's it got?

1086
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,010
Rym: I'm trying to figure that out.

1087
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,670
Rym: There's no pictures on the Wikipedia page.

1088
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:37,864
Scott: My parents actually had a, um, a Scrabble deluxe edition, which if you're going to play Okay.

1089
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,708
Rym: Here's the tagline on the box.

1090
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:43,229
Rym: More spaces, more tiles, more points.

1091
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:44,210
Scott: Okay.

1092
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:45,930
Scott: So it's, so it's epic levels.

1093
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,801
Rym: It's just bigger with quadruple word scores.

1094
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:49,559
Scott: Okay.

1095
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:54,010
Scott: But yeah, I really actually, uh, what was I told?

1096
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,310
Scott: So deluxe Scrabble, right?

1097
00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:04,820
Scott: So regular old Scrabble, which is what I have comes in a tiny box and it's really good cause it's portable and small and cheap, but it's basically a cardboard board and just a bag of tiles.

1098
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,309
Scott: and that's it.

1099
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:10,390
Scott: The deluxe Scrabble has plastic trays to put your tiles in instead of little crappy trays.

1100
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,609
Scott: And it's got pegs to keep score with.

1101
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,290
Scott: So you don't have to write the score down on paper.

1102
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,710
Scott: And it's got a board that's on a, that's on a spinning, uh, daisy kind of thing.

1103
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:23,929
Scott: So you can spin the border on the face, whoever's playing and by God, more board games fucking need that.

1104
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:29,429
Scott: Cause how many times do you fight over who's on the front of the board and who's sitting at the back of the board all the fucking time.

1105
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:36,530
Scott: So, uh, yeah, if you're going to play Scrabble for serious, you should invest in the deluxe edition if you're going to play it a lot.

1106
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:42,708
Rym: All right, Scott, it's Scrabble isn't in English, Afrikaans, Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish.

1107
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:44,150
Rym: It's in every fucking language.

1108
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,129
Rym: There's pictures of all of them.

1109
00:54:45,351 --> 00:54:45,930
Scott: That's pretty cool.

1110
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:46,310
Scott: I want to see.

1111
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:47,648
Scott: I want to see that.

1112
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:48,430
Scott: That'd be pretty interesting.

1113
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:49,769
Rym: Looking for the Japanese one.

1114
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,050
Scott: It would work really well in Hebrew.

1115
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,170
Rym: I don't know if it would work for Japanese at all.

1116
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:54,450
Scott: I'm sure it would.

1117
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,770
Scott: It just like hiragana's or whatever.

1118
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,530
Rym: There appears to not be a Japanese version.

1119
00:54:58,731 --> 00:54:59,004
Scott: Oh shit.

1120
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:02,789
Scott: What about, I'm sure that, you know, there's some languages that works and some, it doesn't.

1121
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,630
Scott: How would it work in Korean?

1122
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:04,950
Scott: Right?

1123
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,145
Scott: Cause you got to combine the leg.

1124
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:14,468
Rym: Maybe if they had transparencies like cells, like upwards and you have to form the characters like that.

1125
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:21,870
Scott: Maybe they have a different game that is sort of the same, but not because like the new pool game that we learned about from, uh, yeah.

1126
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:22,750
Rym: It's like the gas station.

1127
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:23,210
Scott: Exactly.

1128
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:26,930
Scott: If they have like a different game, that's their equivalent of Scrabble for their alphabet.

1129
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:29,930
Scott: And maybe we could adapt that game to English somehow.

1130
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:30,399
Scott: I don't know.

1131
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,350
Rym: Well, Scott, you really not know where Tagalog is spoken.

1132
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,247
Rym: Do you know anything about it?

1133
00:55:34,574 --> 00:55:35,270
Scott: I know nothing about it.

1134
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:36,650
Scott: I've never heard, I've never heard of it.

1135
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:39,070
Rym: You never even read like, I don't know, Cryptonomicon?

1136
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:40,110
Scott: Uh, Nope.

1137
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:41,449
Rym: No, you've never read that?

1138
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:41,755
Rym: No.

1139
00:55:42,231 --> 00:55:42,990
Rym: Oh, all right.

1140
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:44,129
Rym: It's Filipino.

1141
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:45,230
Scott: Oh, okay.

1142
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:46,059
Rym: Okay.

1143
00:55:46,613 --> 00:55:47,047
Scott: How about that?

1144
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,890
Scott: There you go.

1145
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:48,450
Scott: There you go.

1146
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:50,530
Rym: You can use that word the next time you play Scrabble.

1147
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,328
Scott: What does it sound like?

1148
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,709
Rym: I have no idea what Tagalog sounds like.

1149
00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:54,145
Scott: Okay.

1150
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:55,010
Scott: Check it out on YouTube.

1151
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,430
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1152
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:08,529
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1153
00:56:08,931 --> 00:56:13,970
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1154
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,890
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1155
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:21,630
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1158
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
