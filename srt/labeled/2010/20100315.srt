1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,608
Scott: It's Monday, March 15th.

2
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:12,371
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:13,094
Scott: I'm Riff.

4
00:00:13,154 --> 00:00:14,579
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,292
Scott: Tonight, whatever happened to programming?

6
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:18,399
Scott: I don't know.

7
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:19,747
Rym: You don't know?

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,375
Scott: I don't know.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,523
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:29,980
Scott: So today is a day to beware.

11
00:00:32,622 --> 00:00:35,893
Rym: You kept saying you had some sort of crazy thing to talk about.

12
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:35,993
Scott: I do.

13
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,020
Scott: And there's a reason you must beware.

14
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:41,153
Rym: Well, well, well, I point out it's no longer a secret to everyone.

15
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:42,940
Scott: No, it's not a secret to everyone.

16
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:48,519
Scott: But I don't know when, is the Ides just March 15th, or does it have some hours to it?

17
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:53,674
Scott: Like, you know, is it over at five o'clock or something like that?

18
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:55,520
Rym: I think Wikipedia can tell you that.

19
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:57,026
Scott: Oh, that's possibly true.

20
00:00:57,046 --> 00:01:00,882
Scott: But anyway, the Ides are, if not now, recent.

21
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:04,840
Scott: And they are to be bewared for many reasons.

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,096
Rym: Can you name any reason other than one guy got stabbed a long time ago?

23
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:10,678
Scott: I will tell you the reason.

24
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,760
Rym: And it's raining.

25
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:22,560
Scott: So, on Saturday, in a precursor to the Ides, right, the clocks were marched forward, which is a double-edged sword.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,431
Rym: So I actually had a problem this morning at work with that.

27
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,340
Rym: You know, we have, you know, a stock market and everything.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,444
Rym: So we made the time change.

29
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:30,553
Rym: And we're, you know, we're not stupid.

30
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:36,580
Rym: We're not like another unnamed company I worked for that shut everything down for an hour every year because they couldn't handle the logs going back in the fall.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,161
Scott: Mm hmm.

32
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:38,494
Rym: So we were fine.

33
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:48,860
Rym: But monitoring, you know, we have a thing that says, hey, if I don't see a log line from different things that are writing logs within, you know, a few minutes, send an error saying, hey, this thing's not logging.

34
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:50,966
Rym: They, and this is new monitoring.

35
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:54,199
Scott: Every single one of them went, oh shit, I haven't seen a log in an hour.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,017
Rym: Yep, and then a minute later, they're like, no, everything's fine.

37
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:57,420
Rym: Never mind.

38
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:59,500
Scott: It's not that big a problem.

39
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:00,602
Scott: Yeah.

40
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:06,440
Scott: So, you know, there was the, this, the, the prelude to the eyes in which the clock moved forward, which is good and bad.

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,131
Scott: It's good because now the sun is up at the correct time.

42
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:11,059
Scott: It's not dark right now, right?

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,234
Rym: I wish we'd just go to daylight savings time and never come back.

44
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:15,480
Scott: Let's never move the clock back.

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,809
Scott: Let's just keep it where it is forever.

46
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,279
Scott: That's what I would do if I was in charge.

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,022
Rym: Well, you know, they did.

48
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:20,086
Rym: And then it was undone.

49
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,792
Scott: We were that way.

50
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:22,354
Scott: Yeah.

51
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:28,820
Scott: But anyway, the, uh, but the problem with it is of course this weekend is an hour shorter.

52
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:30,443
Rym: Yeah.

53
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:34,498
Scott: So being an hour shorter, you need to get some more sleeps cause you lost some sleeps.

54
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:35,040
Scott: Right?

55
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:36,327
Rym: So when did you go to bed?

56
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:42,796
Scott: I went to bed pretty early last night, but then at four 30 in the morning, right?

57
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,077
Scott: Right.

58
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:48,180
Scott: I was awoken by a honking car horn.

59
00:02:48,660 --> 00:03:02,044
Scott: Now at first, at first I thought this car horn was, you know, perhaps some hobo had bumped into a car and set the alarm off, in which case it would stop shortly, you know, but no, it was not a hobo.

60
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,019
Scott: So the horn honked a bit more.

61
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:08,255
Scott: And notice it wasn't honking with a pattern.

62
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:19,346
Scott: You know, it was literally a human being honking a horn, you know, at, you know, some patterns they just decided and they didn't seem to be moving anywhere.

63
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:26,980
Scott: It wasn't like they were going down the street honking, like their cucaracha horn, you know, it was someone's pretty much sitting still right nearby honking.

64
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:30,919
Scott: So eventually I look out the window to see what the fuck.

65
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:40,616
Scott: And I see this car at four 30 in the morning, pulling out of a garage, you know, one of these really tight garages with the car just barely fits.

66
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:42,525
Rym: You know, did you see that video?

67
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:43,229
Rym: The German guy?

68
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:43,289
Rym: No.

69
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:46,480
Rym: Oh, I got, I make it make a thing the day later.

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,465
Rym: It's the guy who lives.

71
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:57,457
Rym: his driveway is the narrowest thing in the world to the point that he drives in, opens his car door directly into his house, gets into the house and then rolls the car forward to close the door.

72
00:03:59,621 --> 00:03:59,962
Scott: Whoa.

73
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:12,319
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so this van, it's like a mini van is trying to get out of this garage and there was a car parked right in front of the garage, but it's not blocking the garage straight up.

74
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,380
Scott: It's basically like the car is like, like six inches too far back.

75
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,978
Scott: So therefore the mini van can't get out.

76
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,437
Rym: So he's talking to make this jackass move his car so we can get out.

77
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:22,940
Scott: Right.

78
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:31,439
Scott: But he's really, there's no guarantee that that jackass is anywhere within hearing range or will wake up and isn't in like a basement or drunk or who knows what.

79
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,094
Scott: And he, this guy's waking up the whole neighborhood at four 30.

80
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:42,476
Scott: Well, this is why guns need to be legal because I would have just sniped that guy in the mini van from my balcony to his credit at RIT more than once.

81
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,155
Rym: I would, you know, be ready to go to class and I'd pull out.

82
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:49,579
Rym: Remember in colony, we lived in that cul-de-sac and someone would be parked, double parked in front of my car.

83
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:56,391
Rym: I would basically just go to my car and hold down the horn and wait, but not at four 30 in the morning.

84
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:01,905
Rym: Yeah, if it had, I didn't have classes at four 30 in the morning, but had I see, here's the thing, right?

85
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:07,217
Scott: If just looking at the situation itself, the guy blocking the garage is the jackass.

86
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:07,520
Scott: Yes.

87
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:10,400
Scott: As soon as this guy starts honking, the horn is the solution.

88
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,735
Scott: He is now also the jackass.

89
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:13,460
Rym: However, what do you do?

90
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,128
Rym: What recompense can he get?

91
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,299
Scott: He could have just called three run one.

92
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:18,987
Scott: It's New York city.

93
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,840
Scott: It would have been taken care of very easily.

94
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,966
Rym: The dude would have taken a while.

95
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:24,458
Scott: There was a chance the dude would have gotten a ticket.

96
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,647
Scott: It would have done way more damage to that dude and note would have done no damage to the neighbors.

97
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,660
Scott: Now I know that garage.

98
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,160
Scott: See that guy who was parking there.

99
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,060
Scott: I'm probably never going to know who that was or see him again, but that garage, I know that guy now, right?

100
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,419
Scott: I know that minivan now because he, that guy lives there.

101
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:52,922
Scott: So now he is a hated figure in the neighborhood and I know who he is and I'm sure all the other people in my building who are looking out the rear window know who that guy is now and also the building next to that and the building next to that

102
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:53,787
Rym: to it.

103
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:56,040
Rym: What if he did not want to harm the jackass?

104
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,285
Rym: He simply wanted to, maybe he was in a hurry, something really important.

105
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,030
Rym: He had to catch a plane.

106
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,794
Scott: So, okay.

107
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:02,524
Scott: So in this case, so what he did?

108
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:06,579
Scott: instead of, instead of harming, he basically, I don't want to harm the jackass.

109
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,544
Scott: I'll just harm all the neighbors who are innocent neighbors and bring no harm to the jackass at all.

110
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:13,680
Rym: This man exercised his right to free speech.

111
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,840
Rym: He was basically on the street saying to anyone who wishes to care.

112
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,169
Scott: He actually broke the law of no honking.

113
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:21,352
Scott: There's a huge find for honking, especially at four thirty in the morning.

114
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:22,400
Rym: There's no honking zones.

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,340
Rym: You got to find out if that's no honking zone or not.

116
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Scott: I'm sure four thirty in the morning, I, you know, police, they can come up with an excuse to charge you with anything they could have done, you know, disturbing the peace, whatever, whatever.

117
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,540
Rym: You're always of the mind that what if it was just free speech?

118
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,980
Rym: What if he was out spreading the word, the good word?

119
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,579
Scott: He woke me up, therefore he must die.

120
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:48,900
Scott: And the Ides of March shall be upon, I guess they were upon me, but I'll make it so that the next Ides are upon him.

121
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,251
Scott: Maybe I'll change his garage shut on March 15th, 2011.

122
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:51,593
Scott: Much sadder.

123
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,725
Scott: What's he going to do?

124
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,217
Rym: But also much more relevant.

125
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:04,024
Rym: You know, I built a new GeekNights computer and I passed off the previous GeekNights computer to Emily theoretically to use as a prime computer because it's a really fast computer.

126
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:06,860
Rym: Eh, USB bus dead.

127
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:11,578
Scott: How come all the computers remakes broken all the computers of Scott's?

128
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,760
Rym: The computer before this one still worked fine.

129
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,493
Rym: I threw it away because it was too old to be used for anything.

130
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:21,393
Scott: I would like you to prove that that computer would work.

131
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:22,219
Scott: I do not think so.

132
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:22,440
Scott: It

133
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:25,615
Rym: was working perfectly when I got rid of it with my faster computer

134
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:28,870
Scott: and then it sat in the hallway and

135
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:36,112
Rym: might've broke it at some point between when I took it out of the case and left it unprotected in the hallway for many, many weeks tripping over it several times.

136
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:39,085
Scott: All of my computers, no problems ever.

137
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:40,270
Scott: Zero.

138
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:48,190
Rym: The thing is I Googled around and the AB nine motherboard, which I'd picked for various reasons back in the day, I picked a shitty motherboard.

139
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,700
Rym: A lot of people had trouble with that motherboard.

140
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,585
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

141
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:51,431
Scott: I never pick shit.

142
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:51,995
Rym: Okay.

143
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:58,070
Rym: Back then though, when I bought it, the ratings were pretty high and all the reviews on new egg were like, yeah, it's a great motherboard and here's all the reasons.

144
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:03,681
Rym: And in fact, I got the AB nine pro because it was only like $5 more than the regular AB nine.

145
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:03,943
Scott: Yeah.

146
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,880
Scott: The thing is pro doesn't stand for professional on that motherboard.

147
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,274
Scott: It stands for piece of rotten rotten.

148
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:11,419
Rym: What rotten?

149
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:11,740
Rym: What?

150
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:12,963
Rym: That's right.

151
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,053
Rym: That's right.

152
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:20,874
Rym: So I, what I'm going to do with it is I'm pretty sure that there's a voltage drop on the USB bus, right?

153
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:25,080
Rym: I actually, for the first time in forever diagnosed a hardware problem.

154
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:30,760
Rym: So what I'm going to do is either, if I can't fix that problem, it's like a problem in the motherboard.

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,778
Rym: I'm going to turn it into the file server because that thing has 10 status.

156
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,539
Rym: I can make it basically a raid and make it the file server for like videos and everything over the files.

157
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:48,703
Rym: But it might be that the power supply that is feeding the USB bus, cause you know, there's different rails and everything, different voltages.

158
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:56,098
Rym: that power supply is a piece of shit that I bought at a store, no name brand to replace the other one that was incompatible with the motherboard in the first place.

159
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:57,704
Rym: It's possible.

160
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,238
Rym: the power supply is the fault and not the motherboard.

161
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,448
Scott: You know, I don't have these incompatibility problems.

162
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,131
Rym: Yeah.

163
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:05,966
Rym: Well I bought an AVID AB nine and that was my mistake.

164
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,159
Rym: I should have bought an ACEs with an Intel chip set.

165
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,303
Scott: Like I did.

166
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:12,833
Rym: You know, my new computer is ACEs.

167
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:16,128
Scott: Does that AB nine have a, uh, an enforce or something?

168
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:18,820
Rym: Uh, actually I don't remember or what?

169
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:19,764
Rym: I don't remember.

170
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,753
Scott: It has an ICH8R, right?

171
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:22,556
Scott: Which is Intel.

172
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:22,877
Scott: Yes.

173
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,792
Rym: However, my new motherboard has the ICH10R.

174
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:35,293
Scott: I don't know what my computer, my computer, my, the HTPC I just built has the H55, which is very apparently the new hotness.

175
00:09:35,494 --> 00:09:35,736
Scott: Yeah.

176
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:42,179
Rym: Sadly, you know, I was teaching Emily a bunch of stuff about why I built this computer cause she actually just ordered effectively the same computer I have now.

177
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:43,871
Rym: It's about $300 cheaper than it was before.

178
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:47,139
Rym: And she doesn't need a video card cause my old video card is fine.

179
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:49,608
Rym: The 7,900 will play half life too.

180
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:50,753
Rym: Yeah.

181
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:51,677
Scott: Well, yeah.

182
00:09:52,139 --> 00:10:00,320
Rym: But, uh, you know, the, I was trying to explain like the differences, you know, Northbridge, Southbridge and SAC, CAS latency and everything.

183
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,768
Rym: And I realized that about 80% of that stuff is completely irrelevant to anyone making a computer nowadays.

184
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:07,230
Scott: Yeah.

185
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,140
Scott: Pretty much like one weird thing though.

186
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,340
Scott: I do want to point out though, uh, my computer, this on my desk, right?

187
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:17,520
Scott: Which has DR 800 memory, four gigs dual channel, right?

188
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:31,242
Scott: In the windows, like, you know, the windows performance score thingy, it gets a pretty high score for memories, you know, my new computer, which has four gigs dual channel of DDR, like 1066 memory, right?

189
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:35,807
Scott: With a, with a, with a, uh, um, I three, right?

190
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:40,579
Scott: Uh, the memory score in windows is way lower and it's like, why?

191
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:42,569
Scott: It's also a dual channel.

192
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:43,777
Scott: It's supposed to be faster.

193
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:44,219
Scott: What's that?

194
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,585
Rym: Triple channel.

195
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:46,611
Scott: No, not triple.

196
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:47,678
Rym: I got triple channel.

197
00:10:47,758 --> 00:10:49,288
Scott: I didn't, this is a home theater PC.

198
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,320
Scott: It wasn't a, uh, you know, set the house on fire PC until some future crazy Matroska.

199
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:56,164
Scott: Yeah.

200
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:57,534
Scott: But I just thought it was really weird.

201
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,118
Scott: I'm like, huh?

202
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:13,980
Scott: And I'm like, I'm sure I could manipulate cause the motherboard is all those overclocking settings, which I just don't touch at all because I don't want to, you know, I'm no interest and I don't want to, I'd rather have a computer that works in as quiet than is 1% faster, but I'm sure I could modify some memory timings to, to fix that situation.

203
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,643
Scott: But who cares?

204
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:15,328
Scott: The computer works.

205
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:16,637
Scott: I don't need the faster memory.

206
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:17,000
Scott: It works.

207
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:19,008
Scott: So all right.

208
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:20,759
Rym: So you got any news for me?

209
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:31,112
Rym: I do have some news that windows phone seven series, I got to admit, it's real high on my list of maybe when I buy my next phone, I might go that route.

210
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:31,599
Scott: I know.

211
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:49,560
Scott: It's like you never would have thought you would go for the windows phone seven series and it came out and it looked like I expected it to look, you know, it looks like, you know, all the new Microsoft stuff looks, but they just had big announcements about it today, including the current, the MX at mix 10, which is a Microsoft event, right?

212
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:58,460
Scott: The one thing it's got right now, you know, that they've showed, that's like no other phones got, that's like, holy shit is fucking Netflix.

213
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:00,565
Scott: Holy shit.

214
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:02,072
Scott: That's a holy shit right there.

215
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:03,560
Scott: Iphone don't have no Netflix.

216
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,610
Rym: Just Netflix streaming.

217
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:05,136
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:11,364
Scott: You can, you apparently you'll be able to watch streaming Netflix on your windows phone seven series.

219
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:13,895
Scott: That's that is Android.

220
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:14,558
Scott: Don't got that.

221
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:18,457
Scott: Iphone, Iphone has like Netflix app that lets you like, you know, mott fiddle with your queue.

222
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,993
Scott: Free doesn't have that right now.

223
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,860
Scott: And it's like, whoa, windows.

224
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,229
Scott: That is fricking strong.

225
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,559
Scott: Cause it has silver light on it.

226
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:26,740
Scott: Right.

227
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,596
Scott: That's why they were able to do this.

228
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:29,100
Rym: Right.

229
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,537
Rym: Because Netflix uses the silver light DRM.

230
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:32,000
Scott: Yeah.

231
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,800
Scott: But it uses some other DRM when you're not using windows, but well, it doesn't work on Linux.

232
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,141
Rym: Well,

233
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:52,060
Scott: you can, I think you can install silver light on Mac actually, but, but yeah, it's like, you know, there, there are some Netflix streaming things that don't have silver light, but silver light is their default with the DRMs and such, but it's, uh, you know, Microsoft also, you know, they brought out this, uh, dev platform.

234
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:55,240
Scott: You can get today, you know, to start making apps for it and it's free.

235
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,509
Scott: So I'm going to try it out.

236
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,019
Scott: I tried out the Android one too.

237
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:10,962
Rym: I tried out the pre one and I was, it was easy to make apps, but I just have no desire to make an app because I realized the pre is basically being delegated all the way down to like the low end default crappy smartphone OS.

238
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:11,364
Rym: I think.

239
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:11,866
Scott: Yeah.

240
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:17,515
Scott: Well, I mean, it's, it's, it's like all the built in stuff on the pre works and is great, but that's all it does.

241
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:20,600
Scott: You know, it's like, it's like they made a bunch of stuff.

242
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,900
Scott: That's like the core functionality of a smartphone.

243
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:28,566
Scott: They polished it up real nice, but then they didn't give you any additional functionalities like say Netflix streaming.

244
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,052
Rym: Yep.

245
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:33,020
Rym: I mean, it's really sad too because I can't do basic stuff like iPhone and everything.

246
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,368
Rym: There's a Scott trade app.

247
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,991
Rym: Like all this stuff I use, there are apps that just would do it for me.

248
00:13:38,473 --> 00:13:42,433
Rym: And on the pre there's nothing like no reputable company has any app worth a damn.

249
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:43,780
Scott: Yeah.

250
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,228
Rym: And half the free apps have ads in them.

251
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:49,662
Scott: There's this whole iPhone apps also have ads.

252
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:50,366
Rym: Yeah.

253
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:56,932
Rym: No, this is not a thing that is unique to the Palm, but I'm talking about like the, even like the free apps that basically do nothing.

254
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:58,560
Rym: Like it's just a stopwatch.

255
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:03,771
Rym: You can pay five bucks for the stopwatch or it's free, but it has ads in it and it doesn't even work.

256
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:12,160
Scott: You know, I'm really like, I can't figure out like why they failed because it's like they had a great, the smartphone did a lot of stuff that no one else still is not doing right.

257
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,260
Scott: The I amming, you know, unified the email unified.

258
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,170
Scott: They're doing a lot of stuff that is just better.

259
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:18,920
Scott: The UI is pretty great.

260
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:28,546
Rym: You think the Google phone would have the Android universal search, but no, the pre, if you just start typing, it is the smartest thing in the world and figuring out what you want to do with whatever you're typing.

261
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:28,909
Scott: Yeah.

262
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:35,460
Scott: Well, I mean, all the phones have that, but the pre, I think I'm talking about the things that pre has, that no one else has, but nobody video.

263
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:44,379
Rym: I got to find if someone basically had a screen of like three smartphones and he types the same characters into each one, one by one and shows you how they're all reacting in real time.

264
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:47,717
Rym: The pre it reacts faster and picks better.

265
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:48,180
Rym: Yeah.

266
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,288
Scott: It also the camera is so fast compared to the other phones and they added video support to the camera that works just great.

267
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:54,831
Scott: Yeah.

268
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:57,263
Scott: Well the iPhone three GS has video.

269
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:59,660
Rym: No, I'm saying the pre didn't until just recently.

270
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,463
Rym: That was like.

271
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:05,938
Rym: one of the biggest problems with the pre is that you couldn't record video and then one day a random update appeared and it added it.

272
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:06,299
Rym: Yeah.

273
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:12,327
Scott: But it's like they have all this stuff, but it just like, I think it's just marketing or something that just, they can't get people on it.

274
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:22,068
Rym: You know, the other thing that bothers me is that the pre, I think at least the Palm pre that I'm using now has the best physical design of all the existing smartphones.

275
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,494
Scott: I don't know.

276
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:24,800
Scott: The nexus one is pretty hot.

277
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,122
Scott: Yeah.

278
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:27,820
Rym: But I like the fact that the pre has this tiny form factor.

279
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,549
Rym: It's really an itty bitty little phone.

280
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:30,152
Rym: Yeah.

281
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:35,280
Scott: It's also, you know, the, but the, the pre does have the keyboard, which the other people do not have.

282
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,541
Rym: Yes.

283
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,789
Rym: It is the keyboard that I like.

284
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,085
Rym: the fact that it's a vertical keyboard and not a horizontal.

285
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,240
Scott: It's probably the best one with a physical keyboard.

286
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:42,487
Scott: I would say that.

287
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,555
Rym: Yeah, you're right.

288
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:44,220
Rym: I should clarify.

289
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:48,067
Scott: If you have a physical keyboard, it's like if you want a physical keyboard, that's the best one.

290
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:48,531
Scott: You know?

291
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,940
Scott: But the thing is, I think the problem is even though it has a physical keyboard, right?

292
00:15:51,980 --> 00:16:01,100
Scott: It seems to me like the people who want a physical keyboard, right, are, you know, there's, there is people who they like write hold big emails on their thing.

293
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,978
Scott: In which case that keyboard doesn't really good for that, you know?

294
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:04,179
Scott: Yeah.

295
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:09,880
Rym: But I mean like what I do, my typical use is responding to basically GeekNights, PR crap.

296
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:11,380
Rym: Like I have to respond to people pretty quickly.

297
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,159
Rym: So I send fairly long emails from it on a regular basis.

298
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:21,279
Scott: The thing that really bothers me is not so much whether the, you know, I thought I really wanted a physical keyboard, but the thing is I never type anything really long.

299
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:25,480
Scott: The thing that bothers me the most is simply an unresponsive keyboard.

300
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:35,097
Scott: You know, it's like I want, I want, you know, on a phone, it's, why don't people program that, you know, every computer that has a user interface should be programmed in the following way.

301
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,700
Scott: The following way is user input takes precedence over all other processing.

302
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:48,820
Scott: If you're, my computer is encoding a video and decoding a video and playing a 3d game and I move the mouse, all of those processes should be paused.

303
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,560
Scott: Zero instructions executed.

304
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:56,486
Scott: If I need the CPU power to move the mouse arrow around the screen because the CPU is 100%.

305
00:16:56,486 --> 00:16:59,920
Scott: if I start typing something in a box in a web browser, right?

306
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,608
Scott: In a text box and all like a hundred I'm computing like pie out to the billions digit and the CPU is locked up.

307
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,640
Scott: It should just stop completely.

308
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,648
Scott: Stop figuring out the next digit of pie.

309
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,079
Scott: Give no instructions to that.

310
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,700
Scott: No CPU cycles to that process whatsoever.

311
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:27,339
Scott: If that makes it so that my typing in the box is 100% responsive and all phones, all desktop user interfaces, every desktop user application should be programmed in this way.

312
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,533
Scott: User input always comes first, whatever I'm doing and everything else takes a backseat.

313
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:33,798
Scott: Zero priority.

314
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:34,120
Scott: Nice.

315
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,426
Scott: Minus a thousand.

316
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,009
Scott: I don't care.

317
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:36,331
Scott: Right?

318
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:38,100
Scott: And this is how phones need to be.

319
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,247
Scott: Even the iPhone.

320
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:40,174
Scott: Oh, it's so beautiful.

321
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:40,920
Scott: Oh, it's so perfect.

322
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:54,580
Scott: I go to like NOAA.gov and I try to type in my zip code to check the weather and I push one and I have to wait like two seconds before it actually enters the one into the text box because it's busy processing some JavaScript on NOAA.gov.

323
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,087
Scott: Pause the JavaScript.

324
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:56,509
Scott: Just zero.

325
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,314
Scott: No, I don't care.

326
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:58,220
Scott: I am typing here.

327
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,304
Scott: Typing comes first.

328
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:00,471
Scott: Everything else comes last.

329
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:01,195
Scott: Right?

330
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:04,912
Scott: Pro, you know, there is no reason that computers can't be this way.

331
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:05,937
Scott: What?

332
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:06,560
Scott: No one does it.

333
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:07,123
Scott: Right?

334
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:13,959
Scott: I mean the Linux kernel added the preemptible kernel option, but even so still sometimes you're not preempting when you should be preempting.

335
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:15,740
Scott: So fucking get it right.

336
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:22,160
Scott: If you could actually make a user interface always number one priority, I wouldn't care about a software keyboard.

337
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,254
Rym: So here's something really interesting that the PRI did.

338
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:33,080
Rym: They had an update, you know, recently the one that added the camera functionality and there was a note in the bottom about some weird UI update and I read into it a little bit.

339
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,207
Rym: Apparently people had complained that web OS was unresponsive and they made changes.

340
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:42,820
Rym: But as far as I can tell, they didn't actually in any way make it respond faster.

341
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:46,500
Rym: All they did was make it appear to respond faster.

342
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,943
Rym: Like they made icons load immediately even before like the frame inside of it loaded.

343
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:56,399
Rym: So it felt like it was a lot more responsive, but it didn't actually speed it up or anything as far as I can tell.

344
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:59,000
Rym: And that seems to have allayed all the complaints.

345
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:14,580
Rym: I think the best philosophy for this sort of thing is that if you can't actually get the OS to respond to something, cause you might have a legitimate situation where you can't respond to user input or you can't make like icons load as fast as you should.

346
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,258
Scott: As far as I'm concerned, if that happens, then that's a bug, you know, but that's just me.

347
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,213
Rym: But what you should do is at least fake it.

348
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:22,260
Rym: Actually, we have a projector at work though.

349
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:34,408
Rym: This confuses people often where before when you plug it into a computer, it shows a windows desktop on the display immediately based on the last windows desktop that it had displayed.

350
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,740
Rym: So it looks like it's there right away.

351
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:45,031
Rym: Of course, if you actually try to move something, you realize it's just a screenshot and we, we basically have a game of how long does it take for the vendor to figure this out.

352
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:48,892
Scott: Oh, the people coming to sell you stuff.

353
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:49,638
Rym: Yeah.

354
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:49,880
Rym: Yeah.

355
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:51,240
Rym: I had a couple of meetings with them today.

356
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,960
Rym: That's why I wore the black blazer as opposed to my gray blazer.

357
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:56,259
Scott: Because you have to look good for someone to sell you stuff.

358
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,112
Scott: You're not selling, you're being sold too.

359
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,100
Scott: You should dress like a schmuck.

360
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:00,263
Scott: Yeah.

361
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:00,705
Scott: Come on.

362
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:01,348
Scott: What do you got?

363
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:03,980
Scott: You were selling, then you dress up nice.

364
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,729
Scott: Like please buy my thing, please.

365
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,995
Rym: Here's some strategy.

366
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:11,100
Rym: So, you know, three of us go to this meeting, I dress up like this and I don't talk.

367
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,860
Rym: I just sit there and watch everyone else grill the sales guy.

368
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:19,200
Rym: And I just sit there looking kind of very disapproving with a clipboard and I'm writing out, I was just doodling.

369
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:26,578
Rym: And then I asked like one question at the end and the guy was basically scared shitless of me as far as I could tell.

370
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,591
Rym: So you got to play these things out.

371
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:33,460
Rym: And basically my question was, so how much does this actually cost?

372
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:43,355
Scott: So there's someone's, you always pick one person in the meeting whose job is to act for the price, act like the person who's actually making the decision who does not want whatever it is.

373
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:51,768
Scott: And then ask for the prices and everyone else has all the other non price questions or ask like the serious question like, so what do you mean?

374
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:53,980
Rym: this doesn't support sending S and MP traps?

375
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:55,188
Rym: It's a monitoring suite.

376
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:57,040
Scott: Okay.

377
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:09,067
Rym: So I don't want to talk about all the whole history of this, but as you all know, there's been this long stupid history of the EU and the antitrust side of lawsuits with Microsoft.

378
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:12,580
Rym: And they came to the conclusion that, how are we going to get Microsoft?

379
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:24,500
Rym: We're going to force them to either not include IE, which is a stupid idea in windows or to include some various list of competitors to IE in windows.

380
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:35,585
Rym: And I think this is like the biggest example I've ever seen in technological history of completely missing the forest for the trees of completely saying, here's a problem.

381
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:48,368
Rym: The, you know, the Microsoft monopoly, we were going to solve it by picking the stupidest possible aspect of the problem and then having the stupidest possible solution to that problem, thereby solving everything.

382
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,095
Scott: So yeah.

383
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:58,071
Rym: All right, Microsoft, you have to put all the competitors, web browsers in your OS or, Oh, you shouldn't include a web browser.

384
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,741
Rym: So say Microsoft did the, all right, fine.

385
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:01,585
Rym: No web browser.

386
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,400
Rym: How are these people going to download Firefox?

387
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:06,580
Scott: Well, they gave you this.

388
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:07,689
Scott: That's the thing they did.

389
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:11,200
Scott: is when you turn the computer on, it makes you choose a web browser that it will then install.

390
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,260
Rym: So Microsoft in their infinite wisdom decided, and I think this is brilliant.

391
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:24,940
Rym: All right, we're just going to pick the top seven web browsers in the EU based on some dubious metrics, whatever they are, you got to pick one of them.

392
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:29,458
Rym: And the story here is that there are some weird freaking browsers.

393
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:30,929
Rym: There's no, no one's heard of in here.

394
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:37,345
Rym: And as far as I can tell, they're all basically either I E with a different interface or Firefox with a different interface.

395
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:38,271
Scott: Yeah.

396
00:22:38,371 --> 00:22:49,024
Scott: Well, I mean, the thing is when you, when you load up this, you know, European windows seven, right, it lets you choose between, you know, Firefox, I E Chrome opera and Safari, right?

397
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:50,110
Scott: It says here, pick one.

398
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:51,940
Scott: And they're in a different order each time.

399
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,360
Scott: But the randomness of that is actually, it was supposed to be random, but whoever coded it did it wrong.

400
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,317
Scott: It's like Chrome is more likely to appear in the somethings.

401
00:22:59,337 --> 00:22:59,700
Scott: I forget.

402
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,811
Scott: There's an article about it, but you can click more browsers and it'll give you like seven more choices of weird browsers that almost no one uses.

403
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:08,112
Scott: Yes.

404
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:13,332
Rym: Like green browser, which I'm going to quote this article from pcpro.uk.

405
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:18,539
Rym: green browser is your best choice of flexible and powerful green web browser.

406
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,021
Rym: Yeah.

407
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:23,377
Rym: Meaning essentially internet explorer bash with an ugly stick.

408
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:23,980
Scott: Yep.

409
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,828
Scott: And I don't know.

410
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:35,266
Scott: pretty much all the browsers that are in the, you know, more browsers section are either Firefox or internet explore that are sort of mashed up.

411
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:43,670
Scott: Like flock is a, is a is basically Firefox that's modified to have like all sorts of flicker and blogging integrated stuff.

412
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:45,460
Scott: It's basically Firefox with a bunch of extension.

413
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:49,518
Rym: Or a little bit of Polish schlepner gets the bonus points for good name.

414
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:49,900
Rym: Yeah.

415
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,046
Rym: But all it really is.

416
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:53,300
Rym: Oh, here's, here's the relevant quote from the article.

417
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:54,933
Rym: It's no racehorse.

418
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:55,640
Scott: Yeah.

419
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,918
Scott: I think there's another one that has, it lets you switch between Firefox and IE schlepner.

420
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:00,240
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,641
Scott: It comes with like the, you know, IE tab extension pretty much integrated into it.

422
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:06,977
Rym: And it's like, how stupid is the EU?

423
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:14,980
Rym: You know, all this fighting about Microsoft and their monopoly and whatever, and they decide to force them to install competitors product.

424
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:18,620
Rym: What if you sell a Ford car and they're like, well, let's say Ford made tires.

425
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,258
Rym: Well you have to give people the option of having Mazda tires and those tires.

426
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:31,522
Scott: It should be more like if Ford made tires and they said, no, you have to let people choose between Goodyear and Bridgestone and something, something.

427
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:32,065
Rym: Yeah.

428
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:36,971
Rym: But our radio, say Ford makes their, you know, the default radio that they contract out, whatever.

429
00:24:36,991 --> 00:24:38,840
Rym: And that's just in the car.

430
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,152
Rym: You know, buy a Ford car, you get the Ford radio.

431
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:43,568
Rym: And if they said, Oh no, that's anti competition.

432
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:49,568
Rym: You have to include these eight other radios, half of which either don't work or don't fit in the computer in the, in the car in the first place.

433
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:54,480
Rym: It's just, this is the sad conclusion of this whole Epic story.

434
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:08,585
Rym: And it's such a whimper, but I just, I foresee crazy problems going forward as people use these other weird web browsers and have, you know, there's going to be some sort of breach of IE and it's going to turn out that it's not a breach of IE.

435
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:14,967
Rym: It's a breach of one of these crappy web browsers that, I don't know, one third of people picked because it happened to be at the top when they pick web browsers.

436
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:22,260
Scott: Well, another thing is in order to, I think almost no one is going to pick one of those crappy ones because you have to click like, show me more to see any of those.

437
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:26,220
Scott: Most people are going to click IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or opera.

438
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:34,699
Scott: Cause those are the only ones that show up in your face and you're just going to pick one of them and you're not going to click on the tiny thing that says, show me more that then going to show you the crappy ones.

439
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,180
Rym: I feel like the real solution.

440
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,296
Scott: So I think it'd be like less than one fraction of 1% uses something else.

441
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:49,674
Rym: The real solution was to let Microsoft include IE and not bother with the browser war at all and focus on some other, more fundamental aspect of this whole antitrust thing.

442
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:50,076
Scott: Yeah.

443
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:57,197
Scott: How about, you know, focus on some Apple antitrust like, Hey, how come, you know, you can't sync your iPod with anything but iTunes?

444
00:25:57,257 --> 00:26:03,754
Scott: and Hey, how come iTunes won't sync with anything but an iPod and doesn't have a commanding market share of computers?

445
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:06,070
Scott: They do with, I'm talking about iPods here.

446
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,380
Scott: I'm not talking about the computer Mac.

447
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:08,832
Scott: Did I mention the Mac?

448
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:09,860
Scott: I mentioned the iPod.

449
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:15,506
Rym: This was to address the fact that Microsoft has the majority of the computer market for consumers.

450
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:23,783
Scott: Oh, you know how you could fix that force, uh, force companies that make software for windows only to make it for every cross platform.

451
00:26:23,964 --> 00:26:25,653
Rym: So, all right, this is the problem.

452
00:26:25,673 --> 00:26:26,940
Rym: The EU also has very little power.

453
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,008
Rym: Microsoft basically in addressing these EU complaints was saying, all right, we'll play by your silly.

454
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,215
Scott: Yeah, do whatever we don't care.

455
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:35,020
Scott: Just go away.

456
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:36,352
Scott: We'll do whatever silly thing you want.

457
00:26:36,372 --> 00:26:39,700
Rym: And really the EU, they screwed up and that they let Microsoft get away.

458
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,320
Rym: They didn't actually get Microsoft.

459
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,497
Rym: I don't believe Microsoft should have been gotten in the first place.

460
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:43,739
Rym: Yeah.

461
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:47,280
Rym: But all they did was force Microsoft to play by some arbitrary rule.

462
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,396
Rym: That's not going to affect anyone majorly in the long run.

463
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,484
Rym: And Microsoft said, all right, fine.

464
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:51,754
Rym: We did your stupid thing.

465
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:52,379
Rym: Are we done now?

466
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:55,680
Scott: It's pretty much just a stupid, you know, Europe versus us thing.

467
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:11,231
Scott: Basically Europe is finding that, you know, any us companies, right, that are so big and international that they need to do bit that they have a lot of business in Europe that the EU can basically extract money from the U S by regulating these U S corporations.

468
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:13,120
Scott: that happened to do a lot of business in Europe.

469
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:21,260
Rym: Look at how many times like say Germany is a big offender of this because they'll always try to hit some American companies saying, Hey, you showed some Nazi stuff that's against our law.

470
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:24,174
Rym: And luckily most American companies say, okay, whatever.

471
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:24,777
Scott: Yeah, sure.

472
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:25,340
Rym: Yeah.

473
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,123
Rym: Germany,

474
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:54,140
Scott: you know, like if they, you know, they didn't like Nintendo, you know, they could, uh, you know, go after, you know, Nintendo of Europe or whatever, even though it's a Japanese company, you know, it's like, you know, if the, if the U S was upset, they could do the same thing to Japan, you know, via, you know, Toyota or any other sort of, you know, Japanese company that's operating in the U S. So it's basically just a way to disturb the economies and pester other countries by pestering companies that happen to do international business.

475
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:55,900
Scott: So whatever.

476
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,095
Rym: It's just this whole situation really just, it's nothing more than nothing.

477
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:01,820
Scott: Yeah.

478
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, stuff like this does not happen nearly as often as it showed anymore.

479
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:25,700
Rym: And I th this has such an anonymous slash 4chan slash V vibe to it, especially if you look at this video or you look at these screenshots.

480
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:33,092
Rym: So I don't know how many of you are familiar with the max headroom broadcast signal intrusion incident of 1987 max headroom.

481
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,872
Rym: Are you familiar with max headroom?

482
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:38,515
Scott: Maybe.

483
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:39,198
Rym: Are you?

484
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:39,359
Rym: Yeah.

485
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,164
Rym: Are you really?

486
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:40,528
Rym: Yeah.

487
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:41,358
Rym: Okay.

488
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:52,062
Rym: Anyway, so max headroom interrupted television in Chicago, Illinois, like real broadcast television on November 22nd, 1987.

489
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:55,175
Rym: So I'm just going to read from this Wikipedia article.

490
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:56,716
Rym: that basically sums the whole thing up.

491
00:28:57,342 --> 00:29:04,619
Rym: This is like the bad-ass kind of futurism cyberpunk, you know, intercepting the broadcast and sending your own messages out.

492
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:13,040
Rym: But it's so random and 4chan-y and weird that I don't know, it's surreal.

493
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:16,759
Rym: It's surreal and cool in a way that very few pranks have ever managed to be.

494
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,044
Rym: So the first occurrence of the signal intrusion took place during a WGN TV channel.

495
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:25,620
Rym: nine live telecast of some prime time news show.

496
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:29,915
Rym: So the news shows on and then suddenly quote the station.

497
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:41,239
Rym: signal was interrupted for about half a minute by a video of a person wearing a max headroom mask standing in front of a swing sheet of corrugated metal, which imitated imitated the background effect in max headroom.

498
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:44,599
Rym: There was no audio, just a buzzing noise.

499
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:56,292
Rym: The hijack was stopped after 30 seconds or so when an engineer at WGN changed the modulation of their studio link to the John Hancock center transmitter blocking this interception transmission.

500
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:57,920
Rym: So think about that.

501
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:05,442
Rym: In the eighties, someone managed somehow to override real broadcast TV with his own broadcast TV.

502
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:06,146
Scott: Oh shit.

503
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:13,579
Rym: So later that night at 1115 PM, this is where it gets interesting during doctor who it was on TV.

504
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:26,080
Rym: The signal was hijacked using the same video that was broadcast during the WGN hijack, but this time with distorted audio, the person in the max headroom mask appeared as before, and this time he was saying that does it.

505
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,335
Rym: He's a freaking nerd for laughing and jeering.

506
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:32,779
Rym: Yeah, I think I'm better than Chuck Swirsky, freaking liberal.

507
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:45,579
Rym: He goes on to do strange things while periodically saying strange things like catch the way while holding a Pepsi can and he just gets more and more and more bizarre from there.

508
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:57,391
Rym: Some other person appears and this kind of happened and stopped and to this day no one has ever solved how they did it, who it was, why they did it, what they're trying to accomplish.

509
00:30:57,895 --> 00:31:00,710
Rym: And the person, no one ever claimed credit for it as far as I can tell.

510
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:02,258
Rym: And that's the end of it.

511
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,213
Scott: You want to, you want to, do you know about the Heidi game?

512
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:06,280
Rym: The Heidi game?

513
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:07,044
Rym: Yeah, not.

514
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:10,020
Scott: So in the year of, let me read the Wikipedia.

515
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,889
Scott: I forget what year it was.

516
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:15,127
Scott: 1968 there was a football game between the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders.

517
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:15,851
Scott: All right.

518
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:19,671
Scott: And this game was like, this was like a huge game, right?

519
00:31:19,993 --> 00:31:24,400
Scott: Like gigantic, you know, the Raiders were the AFL champions in the previous year, right?

520
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,145
Scott: These teams both had seven and two records going into this game and the game was back and forth.

521
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:30,855
Scott: It was a competitive, great football game.

522
00:31:30,895 --> 00:31:31,418
Scott: Holy shit.

523
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:31,720
Scott: Right.

524
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:44,800
Scott: And seven o'clock came around and at seven o'clock there was a movie Heidi sponsored by Timex that was supposed to go on at seven o'clock, but it was still like the third quarter of this crazy game.

525
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:49,660
Scott: So they had instructions to switch to Heidi at seven o'clock, no matter what.

526
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:55,140
Rym: Ooh, I remember as a kid being mad, every time the Simpsons was supposed to start, but stupid football.

527
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,800
Scott: And now the thing is people started calling in as it got close to seven.

528
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,780
Scott: Some people were saying, are you going to cut the game off?

529
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:02,869
Scott: Is the game going to keep going?

530
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,233
Scott: And some people were calling in to say, is Heidi going to go on?

531
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:05,760
Scott: Right?

532
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:11,080
Scott: The network was trying to call the stations to tell them to not put Heidi on.

533
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:12,704
Scott: Right.

534
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:14,920
Scott: To change the instruction, but they couldn't get through.

535
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:18,980
Scott: And Heidi went on and it was the famous Heidi game.

536
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:25,480
Scott: And you can get the rest of the chat, the details on the Wikipedia's and such, but this is a famous, famous television interruption.

537
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:30,559
Scott: When Heidi went on in the middle of the football game and barely anyone saw the rest of the football game,

538
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,413
Rym: but that was not a guy in a max headroom mask

539
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:34,915
Scott: breaking

540
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:36,059
Rym: into real TV,

541
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:44,317
Scott: but it was incredibly, you know, when Heidi went on the phone calls went, Holy shit.

542
00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:50,556
Scott: And it's the reason that they realized football was popular because Nielsen ratings, that's just bullshit.

543
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:50,799
Scott: Right?

544
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:57,056
Scott: But the Heidi game by putting Heidi in the middle of the football, they were like, Oh shit, the football is popular.

545
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:57,760
Scott: Right?

546
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,146
Scott: That's when they realized.

547
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:05,934
Scott: So anyway, my thing of the day, we've been singing Trilla, a little bit today, a little bit.

548
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:10,031
Scott: Do you know Rick Astley?

549
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:10,794
Rym: I may have heard of him.

550
00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:11,557
Scott: Rick Astley.

551
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:11,818
Scott: Yeah.

552
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:12,663
Scott: Some guy, right?

553
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:12,864
Scott: Yeah.

554
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:16,948
Scott: And you know, he's kind of cool because when everyone started, Rick rolling, he never gave up.

555
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:19,660
Scott: He, he knew that Rick rolling was, was awesome.

556
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,323
Scott: He got it.

557
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:21,349
Scott: He was in on it.

558
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,395
Scott: He knew what was up.

559
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:22,757
Rym: Yup.

560
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,318
Scott: You know, he went along with it.

561
00:33:24,661 --> 00:33:31,309
Rym: I have a feeling if you approached him and said, I would like to pay your appearance fee simply to Rick roll someone, he would say, all right, he's a gladly.

562
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:32,776
Scott: I'd be more than happy to.

563
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,262
Scott: Well, mr.

564
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:39,420
Scott: Tralala law, Edward Kiel is alive and well.

565
00:33:42,283 --> 00:33:43,228
Rym: So does he speak English?

566
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,132
Scott: No.

567
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:55,549
Rym: Cause I would say if there was, somehow if he like lived in America now or for whatever reason, I would be willing to pay to bring him to packs and put him up during the Q and a and Tralala.

568
00:33:56,173 --> 00:34:00,160
Scott: But anyway, here are, there are many videos and many interviews with him on the internet.

569
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:07,100
Scott: And I will link you to the specific one of him watching a bunch of other people trouble allowing on YouTube.

570
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,946
Scott: That's my fan while people are photographing him and talking to him and even trouble lows a little bit.

571
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:13,998
Scott: And he says, he says a bunch of stuff.

572
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,608
Scott: Like he's, Oh, that guy's got the good.

573
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:16,956
Scott: Oh, that guy's good at singing.

574
00:34:17,378 --> 00:34:19,458
Scott: You know, all the guys get a yellow tie just like me.

575
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:28,340
Rym: One of my biggest fantasies has always been to see historical people watching internet memes about them like George Washington watching Washington.

576
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:33,777
Scott: But anyway, this guy when, you know, towards the end, he says something that's pretty fantastic.

577
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:36,080
Scott: He's like, I don't consider this parody.

578
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,714
Scott: He's like look at the joy that these people are having.

579
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:39,659
Scott: Right.

580
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,418
Scott: And now I know the Edward Kiel and Rick Astley are of the same.

581
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,293
Rym: I caught him in the same cloth.

582
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:51,013
Scott: We need, we need them to do a partnership.

583
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:52,480
Rym: Someone who has money.

584
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:53,739
Rym: Make that hat.

585
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,929
Scott: We need both of these talented vocalists to have some sort of duet situation of trullo law.

586
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:08,739
Scott: Never give you up something, something, never going to troll low, low, never going to something along these lines needs to occur.

587
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:15,626
Scott: Perhaps even something as simple as taking the two videos and copying and pasting them together, right?

588
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:18,620
Scott: If not bringing the two men together in a physical space.

589
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:29,480
Rym: Now this gives me two ideas for packs because you know, packs, unlike most cons we go to has that, uh, come up to the microphone and it's, I mean, it's nominally a Q and a, well there's two microphones.

590
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:37,374
Scott: We could get in the same position in both lines and one person go up to the microphone and troll law and the person goes to the other microphone.

591
00:35:38,037 --> 00:35:40,779
Scott: and you know, Rick roll at the same time.

592
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,279
Rym: We could just time it and come up with some sort of bit where two people get to the microphone at the front at the same time and then do a bit.

593
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,079
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

594
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:56,559
Rym: But one thing to do is dress up as troll a low and either have a little speaker that'll play troll a low or be able to sing and actually troll a low.

595
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:08,145
Rym: The other thing is find out what it would take to get Rick Astley to come to the con with us and get him in line and perform perhaps the most epic Rick rolling that has ever been done.

596
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:11,239
Scott: He could wear like a, like a V mask, right?

597
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:16,940
Scott: So as soon as he gets up to the front, start singing and then take the V mask off mid singing.

598
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,424
Rym: Think about it.

599
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:20,047
Rym: He starts singing and people like, Oh, it's just a stupid Rick roll.

600
00:36:20,107 --> 00:36:20,892
Rym: You asshole.

601
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:22,300
Rym: But then it's really Rick.

602
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,243
Scott: That's right.

603
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:24,026
Scott: Oh man.

604
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:27,000
Scott: Or it's the thing is I think he lives in the UK though.

605
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:27,988
Scott: Yeah, you got to pay him.

606
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,360
Scott: We had to get him to come to Boston.

607
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,146
Scott: This can be a lot of monies.

608
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:30,469
Scott: Yeah.

609
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:31,539
Rym: Maybe, maybe impacts west.

610
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,229
Scott: That's gonna be more money.

611
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,600
Rym: So you got to really set it up.

612
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,810
Rym: So you get two guys, right?

613
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,940
Rym: You'd combine the two ideas.

614
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,691
Rym: One guy is two people.

615
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:40,516
Scott: Where does he live?

616
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:41,240
Rym: Right.

617
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:44,940
Rym: So it's me in a V mask and Rick Astley in a V mass.

618
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:47,170
Rym: We get up to the microphones at the same time.

619
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,120
Rym: I Rick roll in the V mass.

620
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,065
Rym: People go boo.

621
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,654
Rym: I rip off the V mass.

622
00:36:51,674 --> 00:36:52,680
Rym: People continue to boo.

623
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:54,647
Rym: He starts Rick rolling.

624
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:56,435
Rym: They go, ah, ha ha.

625
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,646
Rym: They coordinated it, but then they start to boo.

626
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:00,555
Rym: He rips off the V a mask.

627
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:01,420
Rym: It's really Rick.

628
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,669
Scott: That's a little complicated.

629
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:05,340
Rym: It is, but imagine the payout.

630
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,554
Rym: I'd be willing to put forth a secret.

631
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:13,105
Rym: If we took, the problem is if we took donations to try to do it, everyone would see it coming.

632
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:16,380
Scott: Oh, that is a problem.

633
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:19,372
Scott: Anyway, here's awesome videos.

634
00:37:19,392 --> 00:37:21,040
Scott: And there's many linked YouTube videos.

635
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:27,031
Scott: If you go to the related videos section, you can see this, uh, Edward Kiel, Trello low man being very cool.

636
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:28,237
Scott: He is an awesome dude.

637
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:29,685
Rym: That's, that's pretty Epic.

638
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:30,067
Rym: Yep.

639
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:32,060
Rym: So meta.

640
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:36,280
Scott: Oh man, we got met as we got conventions.

641
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:41,320
Rym: So this weekend is the last weekend where we are not going to be at a convention.

642
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,125
Scott: The convention after that will be PAX East in Boston the weekend after this weekend.

643
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,784
Scott: In other words, the weekend of March 19th to the 20th, nothing happening.

644
00:37:52,588 --> 00:38:02,900
Rym: The weekend of March 26, 27, 28 PAX East and the arcade expo East coast in the, uh, Heinz convention center in Baltimore, Baltimore, Boston.

645
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:04,165
Rym: Yeah.

646
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:10,791
Rym: We may be live streaming as myself, but we're doing, we're going to try, we're doing 3.25 panels at PAX.

647
00:38:11,394 --> 00:38:12,720
Rym: Most of them are on Friday.

648
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:14,243
Scott: That's good.

649
00:38:14,263 --> 00:38:19,960
Rym: Uh, we're going to coordinate something, some sort of meetup, some sort of event where I don't know, we'll figure something out.

650
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:33,391
Scott: So in April two, three, four, the next weekend in the same, same bad place, same, well, almost the same bad time, same bad channel, anime Boston, where we are doing four panels.

651
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:35,400
Rym: We're doing five panels.

652
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,022
Scott: Oh fuck.

653
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:38,053
Scott: We're doing, I believe anime.

654
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:39,160
Rym: You should see, okay.

655
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,053
Rym: Bite-size anime, anime openers from around the world.

656
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:46,300
Rym: And I'll point out guys, I'm going to spoil a tiny bit of that panel.

657
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:49,672
Rym: I have the Gundam wing opener in German.

658
00:38:49,692 --> 00:38:51,700
Rym: I have the Gundam wing opener.

659
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,560
Scott: People are just going to get it on YouTube themselves.

660
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,180
Rym: They won't need to come to the convention, but most people aren't going to know about this.

661
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,060
Rym: They're not going to listen to this.

662
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,020
Rym: We're going to get like random people at anime Boston.

663
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,826
Rym: Never heard of us.

664
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:01,755
Rym: That's come to this panel.

665
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:02,158
Rym: I hope so.

666
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,200
Rym: Gundam wing opener in Arabic from Saudi Arabia.

667
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,212
Rym: But then here's the gold.

668
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:12,840
Rym: So in Saudi Arabia, they have an English channel and an Arabic channel.

669
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:16,739
Rym: It was so popular that they then decided to put Gundam wing on the Arabic channel.

670
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:22,046
Rym: They took the Arabic opener to Gundam wing that they had made and translated that into English.

671
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:22,869
Scott: Oh snap.

672
00:39:23,452 --> 00:39:23,814
Rym: Oh man.

673
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:25,280
Rym: And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

674
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,578
Rym: That's not even dangerous.

675
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:32,308
Rym: So we're also doing the secret guide to running an anime club, AKA the panel.

676
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,059
Rym: we've done more times than any panel ever.

677
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:41,960
Rym: And I think we're doing, this isn't confirmed the how to run a panel panel as our throwaway panel.

678
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,460
Rym: What?

679
00:39:43,446 --> 00:39:43,667
Rym: Yeah.

680
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,216
Scott: Where did this panel come from?

681
00:39:45,236 --> 00:39:46,020
Rym: I put it in there.

682
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,760
Rym: Cause remember we have to do a minimum number of panels to get paid.

683
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:50,917
Scott: So why are we doing how to run a panel?

684
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,140
Scott: We could do, we have better panels than that.

685
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,020
Scott: Why don't we do like a comics for the manga reader or something?

686
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,653
Rym: Cause I, I put that one in, but they didn't want it.

687
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,106
Rym: Also that panel, we got to step it up.

688
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:01,315
Rym: The panel is kind of lackluster.

689
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:05,518
Scott: No, but I mean, it's better than freaking, uh, uh, how to run a panel.

690
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:05,960
Rym: Yeah.

691
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,320
Scott: But what's going to come to how to run a panel?

692
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,470
Rym: What panel will have more impact?

693
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:12,219
Rym: Uh, Harris.

694
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:14,302
Rym: Okay.

695
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:16,313
Rym: Remember we could just Rick roll that panel.

696
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:22,338
Scott: So the weekend after that, right, March 10th and 11th, I'm pretty sure, let me just double check it.

697
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:27,398
Scott: Is the mocha arts festival in New York city.

698
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:27,900
Scott: That's right.

699
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:29,633
Scott: 10th and 11th in the same building.

700
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:30,440
Scott: it was in last year.

701
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,517
Scott: It's gonna be a million degrees now.

702
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:35,858
Scott: Even if it won't be a million degrees because it's April, maybe that's why they move into comics.

703
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:38,253
Rym: I mean, this is ostensibly a comic convention.

704
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:39,460
Rym: It is awesome.

705
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,080
Rym: There is no human who would not enjoy themselves at the mocha.

706
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,720
Rym: If you're in New York city and you're a Linux nerd, you should be at the mocha.

707
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,069
Rym: You'll be pleasantly surprised.

708
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:48,096
Scott: You only need to come one day.

709
00:40:48,116 --> 00:40:55,067
Scott: You know, you walk in, you look around, you check out awesome arts and comics and things and you go home and maybe go out to dinner in the city.

710
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:55,632
Scott: It's a nice day.

711
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:55,914
Rym: Yep.

712
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,499
Rym: We'll be there.

713
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,250
Rym: You might be able to go out to dinner with us.

714
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,031
Rym: Uh, if you're not, if you can find us and we don't blow you off.

715
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:02,594
Scott: Yeah.

716
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,016
Scott: Yeah.

717
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:05,677
Scott: But you know, you'll probably see us walking around at the very least.

718
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:07,430
Scott: I mean, I'll probably go there just Saturday.

719
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:10,830
Scott: I don't think I'll go Sunday also, but you know, it's an awesome time.

720
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,176
Scott: The mocha, you should go.

721
00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:12,820
Scott: It's the win.

722
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:20,838
Rym: I believe the weekend after that, we have not confirmed whether or not we'll be there yet is nexus, which is a big rationalist thought atheist convention in the city.

723
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,180
Rym: Yep.

724
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:26,460
Rym: I haven't really planned much for that yet, but I'll note it because there's a decent chance we'll be there doing something.

725
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:26,980
Scott: Okay.

726
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:31,500
Scott: And the final meta, at least for now, there is more metas coming later.

727
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,986
Scott: Oh no, there's a book club is Carl Sagan's cosmos, the book, not the TV series.

728
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:40,260
Scott: And we are experimenting with streaming still.

729
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:51,300
Scott: We're going to try to do streaming at conventions and we're streaming GeekNights is and streaming some other things, but we are currently experimenting with Justin TV and it seems to be working better than you stream.

730
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:57,679
Scott: So make sure to follow GeekNights on Twitter to be alerted to any streaming events.

731
00:41:58,122 --> 00:42:03,387
Scott: And I'm going to try to like download all our recorded streams and put them some, you know, and work that all out.

732
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:10,677
Rym: So once I build that a server I was talking about, we're going to host video just straight up for streaming in addition to, you know, YouTube and whatever.

733
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:10,940
Scott: Yep.

734
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:18,677
Scott: So keep your eyes on front recruit.com's news section and uh, you know, the Twitter slash twitter.com/geeknights and such and such.

735
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:18,998
Rym: Yep.

736
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,135
Rym: I mean, don't expect, you know, we're, we're streaming this show, but it's basically just GeekNights.

737
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:25,080
Rym: We're not doing anything special.

738
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,005
Rym: It's mostly for us.

739
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,333
Rym: It's not for you if you enjoy it.

740
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:27,615
Rym: Great.

741
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:36,469
Scott: But this isn't, yeah, we're streaming GeekNights just to practice our streaming, but we are going to do other non GeekNights shows that are video shows specifically that are different.

742
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:37,919
Scott: So watch out for those.

743
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:47,620
Rym: So, uh, I believe you can introduce this because you're the one who brought this up when we were doing our, uh, our test screen test morning show the other day.

744
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,220
Scott: That is true.

745
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:52,911
Scott: So there was this article I read and the article was, is called whatever happened to programming.

746
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:56,850
Scott: And I read this article and I was like, good God, do I agree with this guy?

747
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:03,653
Scott: This guy is like speaking, you know, it's when you, someone says something and you're like, oh my God, you are so like speaking to me totally.

748
00:43:03,673 --> 00:43:04,396
Scott: Oh my God.

749
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,520
Scott: You know, like a, like a valley girl.

750
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,100
Scott: We'll talk about like a pop star boy band or a hippie.

751
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,957
Scott: We'll talk about the dead or something like that.

752
00:43:12,038 --> 00:43:12,260
Scott: Right?

753
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,949
Scott: So this guy was talking like that.

754
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,500
Scott: I was like, ah, he's so right.

755
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:20,020
Scott: And what this guy was talking about was how he learned to program, right?

756
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,380
Scott: When he was 14, he would write, let's see, I'll quote him exactly.

757
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:30,001
Scott: I'm not going to read his whole article, but he says when he was 14, he wrote space invaders in basic on a Vic 20.

758
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:42,844
Scott: He wrote a mud in sea on a terminal attached to a sun three, when he was 22, he wrote, uh, the guts of a text database system still in sea now on a sun three 80.

759
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:43,005
Scott: Right.

760
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:54,991
Scott: So, you know, this is the kind of coding that he was doing and the kind of coding that I learned to do right when I was a kid and also even in college was the same sort of stuff, right?

761
00:43:55,675 --> 00:44:03,992
Scott: It's you, you have these basic constructs of software programming, you know, if while variables, right?

762
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:07,528
Scott: Functions, you know, for loops, right?

763
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:14,140
Scott: These sort of basic constructs, depending on what language you're using and at what level you are, you know, if you're an assembly, you don't have those, you don't have those functions.

764
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:20,480
Scott: You have, you know, jump and, and, you know, move memory and these sorts of things, you know, and addition and subtraction.

765
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:36,819
Scott: But programming was all about, you know, you have to, you have to build this piece of software and you have, you have these basic components to work with and you had to create an algorithm mixing, you know, these simple constructs together to build a more complicated thing.

766
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:44,080
Scott: You know, the complex emergent behavior of a, you know, a system that is just a bunch of simple things arranged in a complex way.

767
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,129
Scott: And that is what programming is all about.

768
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,180
Scott: And that is why programming is fun.

769
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,399
Scott: It's like, aha, I need to write a hangman game.

770
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:52,215
Scott: And all I've got is variables and loops.

771
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:53,564
Scott: You know, how do I do this?

772
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:56,160
Scott: And you solve this problem using these tools, right?

773
00:44:56,822 --> 00:45:06,500
Scott: But nowadays at work, you know, the job that I have and most jobs that programmers have and most programming that is done is no longer this, right?

774
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,561
Scott: Most people who program are not doing this behavior that I was taught to do.

775
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:14,740
Scott: And most people were taught to do in, in college, right?

776
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:16,540
Scott: Or wherever they learn programming.

777
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:23,469
Scott: All people are doing now is they're taking libraries or frameworks and gluing them together, right?

778
00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:30,920
Scott: For example, I recently, wrote a small script that would go to Google docs, right?

779
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,840
Scott: Get all, figure out what documents I had, right?

780
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:42,060
Scott: Download any documents that were up there in a, in a, you know, PDF format or whatever, or doc format or whatever.

781
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:45,617
Scott: And then save those documents to Amazon S3, right?

782
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:51,976
Scott: So normally, right, if I was going to program this and say C from scratch, how would I do this?

783
00:45:52,038 --> 00:46:01,428
Scott: Well, I need to make a TCP connection to Google and that I would need to figure out their protocol and I would have to send over to construct a packet and send it over and such, right?

784
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:03,340
Scott: And I had to do all these, these little things.

785
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,760
Scott: And I had to, you know, with, with just the basic tool set, I'd have to construct all this stuff, but nowadays is the library.

786
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,899
Scott: So what I do in Python, I say, import G data, which is the Google data API.

787
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:19,863
Scott: Then I import Bato, which or S3, which is the Amazon S3 API, right?

788
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:23,460
Scott: And I say, G data dot, get list of documents.

789
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,500
Scott: Then I get this list of documents in memory.

790
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:29,540
Scott: And then I just have to manipulate it a little bit to change the format of it.

791
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:40,471
Scott: You know, maybe it's strings and, you know, I need to just change the shape of whatever that spits out and then need to take that new shape so that, you know, let's say Google data spits out a square, but Amazon S3 is a circle.

792
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:41,760
Scott: I just need to round off the square.

793
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:48,553
Scott: And then I say Amazon dot S3 put data, the square, the circle that I've now circled.

794
00:46:48,613 --> 00:46:49,239
Scott: And then it's done.

795
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,187
Rym: Think about your work.

796
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,180
Rym: You're, you're a programmer.

797
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:56,069
Rym: You know all about programming, like the basics of it, like, you know, bubble sort and all that kind of stuff.

798
00:46:56,753 --> 00:47:00,419
Rym: But, and then I, you know, even the code I write now is basically the same thing.

799
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:06,880
Rym: I spend the vast majority of my time coding in the design part first, which I like, you know, designing like, what do I want to accomplish?

800
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,597
Rym: What's my flow?

801
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:12,180
Rym: But then implementing it is 99% looking up the syntax of libraries.

802
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,593
Rym: Like what object does this take?

803
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:15,600
Rym: What does it output?

804
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,451
Rym: What's the name of the method I have to call?

805
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:18,859
Rym: What do I have to give this method?

806
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:25,213
Rym: It's there's at no point in my, like maybe 1% of the code I write is the part I care about doing the thing I want it to do.

807
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:29,299
Rym: But 99% of the rest of what I write is just the glue between the pieces.

808
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,278
Scott: Well, now see here, the, here are the problems with this, right?

809
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:34,267
Scott: Well, here's the good parts, right?

810
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:36,980
Scott: If you want to do something complicated, right?

811
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:41,080
Scott: Like, let's say, you know, copy all your Google docs to Amazon or something, right?

812
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:53,035
Scott: It's actually pretty easy for a normal person to read the documentation and sort of figure out how to do it, even if you're not so good at programming, you know, because you can just read and read and read and read documentation until there's an answer.

813
00:47:53,055 --> 00:47:57,940
Scott: And they say, Oh, use this line and that'll spit this out and then use this line to send it over.

814
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:58,460
Scott: Right?

815
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:12,565
Scott: So it gives normal people who actually dare to venture into the areas of writing code, you know, in Python or Ruby or something like that, vast powers to do advanced functionality that is not available in other software.

816
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:12,929
Scott: Right?

817
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:13,980
Scott: So that is a good thing.

818
00:48:14,421 --> 00:48:14,582
Rym: Yep.

819
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:25,160
Rym: And no one's going to argue that it's kind of like when we talk about, you know, changes in video games over the years or how eight bit 16 bit, we're never going to say you should go back to the crappy technology because it happened to make a few things better.

820
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,000
Scott: Now here are the problems with this, right?

821
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:35,520
Scott: Problem number one is that a lot of these libraries that you're, you know, importing to get these advanced functions from actually kind of suck ass.

822
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:44,340
Scott: So what happens is, you know, everyone out there who wants to do X, right, uses this library because it's the one, right, that's out there.

823
00:48:44,481 --> 00:48:45,530
Scott: And it has all the functions.

824
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:53,206
Scott: But if it sucks, now everyone using it is writing shitty software and nobody's making library itself any better.

825
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:59,680
Scott: Cause no, basically anything that happens in the library, even if it's open source, almost no one actually looks at the source of it.

826
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,399
Scott: No one's investigating how it works.

827
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,114
Scott: They're only concerned with their own code and as long as no bugs in the underlying code.

828
00:49:06,134 --> 00:49:13,999
Rym: I mean, my, my interaction with the Python SNMP frame or the SNMP like stuff is basically just, well, how do I make it work in my program?

829
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:16,197
Rym: I've never even looked at what it actually is doing.

830
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:16,439
Scott: Yeah.

831
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,960
Scott: And if it had a bug in it, right, what would you do?

832
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,295
Rym: I would code around the bug in my code.

833
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:26,800
Rym: I'd be like, all right, if I try to send a trap out through it, it sends the trap wrong cause it doesn't spoof the ID right or something.

834
00:49:27,141 --> 00:49:33,249
Rym: So I'll send it a fake ID and I'll make a wrapper around the library to send it this, the data it'll need.

835
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,220
Rym: So I know that then the output of it will be correct.

836
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,540
Scott: You might report the bug right on the, to the open source project.

837
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:41,828
Scott: If it is open source, right?

838
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:45,820
Scott: I mean the G data API, I don't know how it's, I think it's kind of open source.

839
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,536
Scott: I don't know exactly how open source it is.

840
00:49:47,557 --> 00:49:48,968
Scott: You know, I don't see why it would be closed.

841
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:52,640
Scott: Google does open source a lot of things, but you know, there are some things that aren't open source.

842
00:49:52,700 --> 00:50:01,600
Scott: So in that case it is a black box, but you know, very few people actually patch or will go and look at the code of anything, you know, to figure out what's going on underneath.

843
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:03,499
Rym: I think there's a far more subtle danger here.

844
00:50:04,203 --> 00:50:08,232
Rym: And I run into this a lot and it, a lot of times programming tasks seem very daunting.

845
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:16,119
Rym: and imagine a non programmer and you're trying to show them some code or they're looking at some code, like not teaching code, but real working code.

846
00:50:17,362 --> 00:50:29,539
Rym: It is 100% incomprehensible, even though most programming languages, like the structure of them is inherently readable, you know, make this variable, put something in this variable, do something with it, call this function, go here, you know, all this basic stuff.

847
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:34,420
Rym: But when your code basically is, use this function in this library.

848
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:36,860
Rym: Now take the output from that and use it in this library.

849
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,749
Rym: Now use this library.

850
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:38,640
Rym: Now use this library.

851
00:50:39,521 --> 00:50:43,799
Rym: It's all basically the wizard using magic words to make things happen.

852
00:50:44,403 --> 00:50:44,604
Scott: Yeah.

853
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:46,460
Rym: It's pretty much like it's just magic words.

854
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:46,641
Scott: Yeah.

855
00:50:46,661 --> 00:50:48,070
Scott: You're not solving a problem.

856
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,680
Scott: You're not coming up with an algorithm.

857
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:53,058
Scott: You're basically looking up in, you know, a spell book.

858
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:53,540
Scott: Okay.

859
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,580
Scott: What spells are available, right?

860
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,260
Scott: And one spell is upload to this and one spell is download from that.

861
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:02,916
Scott: And all these spells are already in these libraries, right?

862
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:03,700
Scott: These spell books.

863
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:15,259
Scott: It's like, all right, figure out which spells to cast in which order and how to get the, you know, the rabbit that's created by the first spell to go into the hat that, you know, the second spell needs.

864
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:20,900
Rym: So I want to turn this rabbit into a gold for some reason.

865
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,267
Rym: I want to make a gold rabbit.

866
00:51:22,348 --> 00:51:22,649
Rym: All right.

867
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,520
Rym: Or so, all right.

868
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:28,800
Rym: I don't have say the only spells I ever polymorph other, but it doesn't let me turn it into a mineral.

869
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:32,427
Rym: It only lets me turn it in another animal, but I have some other spell.

870
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:36,024
Rym: that's like turn person into stone and then I have some other thing.

871
00:51:36,085 --> 00:51:36,569
Rym: that's all right.

872
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:37,719
Rym: Turn stone into gold.

873
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:42,765
Rym: So I take these three spells and make this really clunky framework that turns the rabbit into gold.

874
00:51:43,026 --> 00:51:43,247
Scott: Yep.

875
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:53,915
Scott: Whereas if you were writing and say assembler, you probably could have in very few lines, turn the rabbit into gold and it would be if you did, if you're a quality programmer, it would have been a much more quality solution.

876
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,914
Scott: And the thing is, this isn't just libraries either, right?

877
00:51:57,196 --> 00:51:59,500
Scott: For example, let's say I want to make a website, right?

878
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,300
Scott: Now most websites out there don't really need to be high performance.

879
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:04,931
Scott: Super awesome, right?

880
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:06,180
Scott: You know, a blog, whatever.

881
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,997
Scott: But let's say you use Apache, the web server, you know, you put up some HTML files, the server serves them out.

882
00:52:12,037 --> 00:52:12,480
Scott: Very nice.

883
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,231
Scott: But let's say you need to do something advanced, right?

884
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:17,702
Scott: Like let's say Twitter, right?

885
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:27,100
Scott: Instead of say, you could write Twitter in, you know, you could, there are Twitter clones in every language now, you know, and you could use like mod Python on Apache, right?

886
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:32,138
Scott: You could also just write Twitter as a standalone application.

887
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:34,830
Scott: You know, it would open up port 80.

888
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,704
Scott: It would accept incoming connections on port 80, right?

889
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:40,447
Scott: You don't have Apache in the picture, you know, get all that stuff out of the way.

890
00:52:40,468 --> 00:52:42,320
Scott: I am writing a single program.

891
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,774
Scott: I could write it in freaking C or anything I wanted.

892
00:52:44,835 --> 00:52:46,041
Scott: It opens up port 80.

893
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,146
Scott: It acts as a web server.

894
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,840
Scott: It reads HTTP, you know, headers coming in.

895
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,924
Scott: It figures out what to do.

896
00:52:51,366 --> 00:53:03,219
Scott: And if I did do this, the performance of, you know, and the benefits of doing it well and the ability to scale and the ability to control every aspect of the program would be so vastly superior.

897
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:14,780
Scott: You know, I've heard things like mebo.com are written in C plus plus, you know, people are doing things like this, you know, it is not unheard of, but fewer and fewer people are doing things like this now.

898
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:21,576
Scott: One of the other negative effects of this that I see is that I think people are going to forget how to do this.

899
00:53:21,677 --> 00:53:24,835
Rym: Well, no, I think you end up having two different kinds of coders.

900
00:53:25,378 --> 00:53:40,900
Rym: I mean, people who are just practical coders, you know, working with real life code only who didn't study code independently of the real world applications who just have to get stuff done will be very proficient at knowing the names of all the modules and libraries and how to link them all together to be the glue.

901
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:45,858
Rym: But they can't actually address anything complex if the libraries don't already do it.

902
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:55,860
Scott: But I think that fewer and fewer people will, there'll be less and less people who know how to modify or write a library, you know, and then there'll be even fewer people who do it well.

903
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:58,059
Scott: So many libraries out there just suck.

904
00:53:58,461 --> 00:54:05,560
Rym: Well, the people, I think a university education or, you know, any sort of like theoretical education in coding will give you that.

905
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:12,975
Rym: I think it makes it a more subtle problem is that it makes it very difficult for people who want to learn how to code to get into it.

906
00:54:13,015 --> 00:54:22,897
Rym: because the old adage, and I used to agree with this a lot was, all right, if you want to learn how to code, the quickest way is to code something you need that works because you'll be motivated to finish it.

907
00:54:23,382 --> 00:54:28,560
Rym: But if you just code something that'll do what you need it to do, you're just going to take libraries and bang them together.

908
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:42,288
Rym: But if you learn how to code in a very simple, like that basic thing that we were talking about the other day, if you learn how to code something in basic, you're going to learn all the basic logic concepts of what coding means as opposed to the practical glue crap.

909
00:54:43,574 --> 00:54:52,780
Rym: Of course, in the end, the practical reality is that gluing different pieces of data together is 99% of what the world needs for everything.

910
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:53,764
Scott: Yeah.

911
00:54:53,784 --> 00:54:54,958
Scott: Well, that's, you know, that's the other thing.

912
00:54:54,978 --> 00:54:56,454
Scott: It's like, I'm sitting at my job, right?

913
00:54:56,475 --> 00:55:04,360
Scott: And it's like, I have the skills to write a library, you know, depending on the library, of course, I probably couldn't write libraries for certain things, but for other things I could do a pretty good job.

914
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,115
Scott: And for other things I could do a great job, but I never do.

915
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:07,195
Scott: Why?

916
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:11,814
Scott: Well, because at work, no one's ever going to pay me to sit around and do that.

917
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:17,038
Scott: when I could just reuse something and get the job done faster and save more, you know, there's no money reason to do it.

918
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:24,259
Scott: So fewer and fewer people are going to pay anyone to write libraries and basically shitty libraries will dominate and software will get shittier and shittier.

919
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:34,032
Scott: And I think actually if software didn't get shittier and people actually were writing their code better that we could get a lot more out of the hardware that we've got, you know?

920
00:55:34,052 --> 00:55:48,500
Scott: Uh, and right now I think that actually software might be getting shittier at a sort of, you know, dangerous rate to where like our hardware is, you know, we're not, we're really starting to lose, you know, it's like, you need to get that faster CPU only because the software is crappy.

921
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,720
Rym: I am somewhat hesitant to say that to go down that road.

922
00:55:51,820 --> 00:56:06,580
Scott: It's not for, I'm not saying for like normal people, but you'll notice it and say large, uh, applications and scaling big things, you know, like people are out there and what they're doing to scale things like Facebook and such, you know, is, you know, my website is too many visitors.

923
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:07,355
Scott: So what do I do?

924
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:12,687
Scott: Well, I'll just have more web servers and a load balancer and I'll get more database servers and more, right.

925
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:14,459
Scott: And men cashed and all this stuff.

926
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:24,431
Rym: But at the same time, be careful because so many people make the slippery slope argument of, we should just write everything in assembler because that is the way to get, you know, we're some fast hardware made us lazy.

927
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:24,571
Rym: Yeah.

928
00:56:24,852 --> 00:56:26,620
Scott: Sometimes you should though.

929
00:56:26,761 --> 00:56:27,424
Scott: And I think the thing is.

930
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:32,702
Scott: the thing is people are doing it zero times and they're the cases where they should write it in assembler, they're not.

931
00:56:32,783 --> 00:56:34,939
Scott: or the case of they should write it and see they're not.

932
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:44,020
Scott: Well, look at how Java does it with the Justin time compilation and like the way Java, a lot of those LLVM J I T things are going to help us out a whole lot.

933
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:49,131
Rym: But it's the idea that, you know, in an average program, you write 98% of the program uses like 1% of the resources.

934
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,740
Rym: You've got one tiny piece of your program that is the resource intensive part.

935
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:57,620
Rym: And it's usually orders of magnitude more intensive than everything else.

936
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,331
Rym: Cause that's where the work is done.

937
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:00,740
Rym: You know, that's like the loop.

938
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:07,034
Rym: In my case that scrapes the billion, well not billions, the tens of millions of log lines per second.

939
00:57:07,537 --> 00:57:11,860
Rym: And you know, does something with them like that part of the program is 99% of the performance.

940
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:17,420
Rym: That's the case where you hire someone or you let someone write an assembler program that does that perfectly.

941
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,636
Rym: And then you have people like me do the glue around that library.

942
00:57:21,656 --> 00:57:22,058
Rym: Yep.

943
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,822
Scott: Well, I mean, you look like in Python, you can see, cause.

944
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:32,060
Scott: in Python and many other high level languages, you can write like a part in C, you know, a lot of people write a game and then put the really intensive part.

945
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:43,980
Scott: They'll write in C and import that as, you know, the library will be C. Like SciPy is a science library for Python, but SciPy itself is written in C, you know, so SciPy is really fast and kind of awesome.

946
00:57:44,322 --> 00:57:54,658
Scott: And then you can just write easy Python code to use it, you know, and if people would do those things more often, even when they don't have to, right, we could get a lot more performance and a lot better things.

947
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:05,463
Scott: Now, the major problem that I have personally, and is why this guy, you know, with his article was speaking to me so much is that I hate writing this glue code.

948
00:58:05,484 --> 00:58:06,871
Scott: It is not what I learned to do.

949
00:58:06,931 --> 00:58:08,580
Scott: It's not why I like programming.

950
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,300
Scott: It's boring and sort of painful.

951
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,760
Scott: All I do every day is I have to look stuff up, right?

952
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:16,160
Scott: I look up the magic words and then I type them in.

953
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,670
Scott: I look up the magic words and I type them in.

954
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,305
Scott: I'm not solving problems, which is what I like doing.

955
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:21,972
Scott: It's not fun.

956
00:58:22,012 --> 00:58:25,559
Scott: It doesn't satisfy my, you know, it's not why I like coding.

957
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,695
Rym: I'm speccing out a huge program at work right now.

958
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:36,220
Rym: Like I'm, I'm speccing out the stuff that we're then going to write and we're going to outsource to some people, you know, some of the writing of it and modules and everything and speccing it out.

959
00:58:36,482 --> 00:58:40,832
Rym: When I finally had time to do it, you know, I sat down for three hours, like how am I going to architect the software?

960
00:58:41,194 --> 00:58:42,140
Rym: That was super fun.

961
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:44,773
Rym: Like that was the most fun I've had at work in a long time.

962
00:58:45,477 --> 00:58:48,539
Rym: And then it was like, all right, how, how are we going to actually code this?

963
00:58:49,221 --> 00:58:53,060
Rym: And then it was just looking up libraries, looking up the capabilities of them.

964
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:59,011
Rym: Actually writing the code is going to be horrifyingly tedious because no part of what we're doing is novel.

965
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,919
Rym: No part.

966
00:59:00,421 --> 00:59:06,410
Rym: What's novel is that no one has glued together all these individually solved problems together in a way that works before.

967
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:11,060
Scott: Now, you know, sometimes, you know, of course gluing, you know, creates many awesome things.

968
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,366
Scott: Look how many people have done some awesome stuff just by gluing Google maps to whatever or whatever.

969
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:15,688
Scott: Right.

970
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:17,480
Scott: You know, and that's it's so easy.

971
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,999
Scott: That's why so many people are able to do it.

972
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,078
Rym: Well, it's also the most important part of information technology right now.

973
00:59:23,118 --> 00:59:29,550
Rym: today is taking data sets that are not connected and somehow connecting them to accomplish some third goal.

974
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:29,853
Scott: Yes.

975
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:34,417
Scott: And it is wonderful, except for the fact that it is really the actual act of doing it.

976
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:38,056
Scott: You know, coming up with the idea to do it is solving a problem.

977
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:38,780
Scott: How do I do this?

978
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,111
Scott: How do I, you know, make podcasting better?

979
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,724
Scott: Oh, well, you do this and this and this and this and this and this.

980
00:59:43,885 --> 00:59:51,560
Scott: Well, think about a manual labor of actually creating that solution is horrendously painful and tedious and slow.

981
00:59:51,681 --> 01:00:03,135
Scott: And this is why so many people just say, fuck it and install WordPress rather than writing a blog or, you know, fuck it and using Ruby on rails instead of, you know, this is the same reason it sucks to be a DBA.

982
01:00:03,235 --> 01:00:10,399
Rym: And like at RIT, they tried to trick people into joining the database concentration and everyone took the first database database class and said, you know what?

983
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,022
Rym: Fuck this.

984
01:00:11,585 --> 01:00:14,220
Rym: Because the fun part is I've got two data sets.

985
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,538
Rym: I want to mash them together and do X and here's my process and here's, I want to accomplish it.

986
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:24,420
Rym: The not fun part is select X from table outer join blah.

987
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:43,485
Scott: The thing is actually SQL is kind of fun for me, especially, you know, not just normal everyday mundane SQL, but sometimes it's like you have some data arrangements and tables and it's like, I need to get this complicated query, you know, I need to figure out how many of these per those on Mondays, you know, something like that.

988
01:00:43,526 --> 01:00:53,040
Scott: And that, you know, SQL can be fun in that way, you know, and there's actually, that's sort of the problem is you look at things like, you know, there's a lot of ORMs out there and object relational mapper.

989
01:00:53,162 --> 01:00:58,419
Scott: If anyone doesn't know what that is, Django and Ruby on rails have these as many other things do.

990
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:30,060
Scott: Basically you can interact with a database without writing any SQL like Django, you know, which I use and it's, you know, what the front recruit.com runs on and that's what I use at work is, you know, it's a Python web framework and basically if you don't want to, you almost never have to actually write SQL, but it's talking to an SQL database, but you don't write any SQL, you do something like, you know, episode, you know, if I'm doing GeekNights, right, I would do episodes dot objects, dot filter, uh, you know, category equals Monday.

991
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:33,157
Scott: And that would give me a list of all the Monday episodes behind the scenes.

992
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:42,340
Scott: It's generating, you know, select from episodes, underscore episode, you know, where category equals, right.

993
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:45,400
Scott: So it's generating SQL, you know, and it's on the front end.

994
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,694
Scott: I'm just dealing with objects and this is really easy.

995
01:01:48,116 --> 01:01:50,528
Scott: The thing is, the SQL it generates is shit.

996
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,300
Scott: I can get just about any page on our site.

997
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:56,060
Scott: I can get all the data with one query, one clever query.

998
01:01:56,441 --> 01:01:59,817
Scott: Most of the time it's making like 10 queries because it's just stupid.

999
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:00,460
Scott: Right.

1000
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:05,807
Scott: But the only benefit of using an ORM is that it makes things easier for the developer to glue.

1001
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,440
Scott: It has no other benefit whatsoever.

1002
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:10,879
Scott: And it has this severe detriment of making really stupid SQL.

1003
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,449
Rym: So what if someone made better glue?

1004
01:02:13,489 --> 01:02:17,958
Rym: What if that wrapper was not technologically possible as a problem?

1005
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:24,912
Scott: No, because objects don't match to relational databases and object model and a relational model are not correlative.

1006
01:02:24,952 --> 01:02:25,857
Scott: You can't do it.

1007
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:29,840
Scott: You know, if you were going to use one of those no SQL databases, right?

1008
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:39,833
Scott: Like let's say CouchDB or Cassandra, which are becoming very popular, then you could have an object, which of course, as long as it's a object, you know, can correspond to the schema-lessness.

1009
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:41,902
Scott: if you're using a schema-less one, right.

1010
01:02:42,224 --> 01:02:44,680
Scott: You could, you know, have an object that maps, right.

1011
01:02:44,781 --> 01:02:46,260
Scott: And it works, would work a lot better.

1012
01:02:46,661 --> 01:02:51,120
Scott: The problem is, is that these no SQL databases are non-relational by nature.

1013
01:02:51,222 --> 01:03:03,859
Scott: That's sort of the point, you know, they sacrifice the relational features in favor of, you know, different abilities to scale and clone and have a bunch of servers really easily and such, you know, easier partitioning and things like that.

1014
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,460
Scott: The thing is they're non-relational.

1015
01:03:06,641 --> 01:03:12,436
Scott: So what do I do if I want to say code Facebook where Rym is a friend of Scott and I have these relations?

1016
01:03:12,597 --> 01:03:21,440
Scott: Well, basically what you end up doing is instead of doing joins on the database side, you end up coding the actual logic of a join in your program.

1017
01:03:21,621 --> 01:03:25,985
Scott: And now the server itself is doing the joining as opposed to the database server doing the joining.

1018
01:03:26,548 --> 01:03:26,750
Scott: Right.

1019
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:34,290
Scott: And it's going to be a lot less efficient than, you know, make a database of objects compared to Postgres, which is really good at fricking joining.

1020
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:36,763
Scott: compared to your Python code that's going to join.

1021
01:03:36,783 --> 01:03:37,327
Scott: Give me a break.

1022
01:03:37,549 --> 01:03:37,790
Rym: Yep.

1023
01:03:38,153 --> 01:03:44,039
Rym: So at the same time, the your Python code is easier for 99% of people to deal with than Postgres.

1024
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,683
Rym: I mean, I have trouble even installing Postgres and I use it as a professional on a daily basis.

1025
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:49,286
Scott: Yeah.

1026
01:03:50,432 --> 01:04:03,413
Scott: But anyway, it's, you know, it's just really, I want to write, you know, the kind of code that is, you know, the kind of code I learned, you know, take these simple constructs, loops, variables, you know, functions, et cetera, right?

1027
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:04,217
Scott: Even classes.

1028
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:08,984
Scott: And, you know, build up, write the algorithms, you know, make them better, make them fast.

1029
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:09,910
Rym: You know what you're saying?

1030
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,280
Rym: You're saying I'll paraphrase.

1031
01:04:12,062 --> 01:04:15,943
Rym: I should have stayed in college and gone into academia and gotten my doctorate in coding.

1032
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:17,858
Scott: Not really.

1033
01:04:17,879 --> 01:04:21,600
Scott: I mean, there are jobs out there you can get where you're still writing low level code.

1034
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,413
Rym: You know, you could have gotten a job like that with my company.

1035
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:26,522
Scott: Uh, no, not really.

1036
01:04:26,603 --> 01:04:27,306
Scott: Yeah, no.

1037
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:36,840
Scott: The guy needs to get a job, say like not writing, like an Android app, but writing Android itself, you know, like, you know, writing drivers for mobile handset,

1038
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:42,790
Rym: but you're just gluing the software and hardware together by calling the hardware, you know, effectively API

1039
01:04:44,075 --> 01:04:47,090
Scott: sort of, but sort of not, you know, you, you basically,

1040
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,739
Rym: I think the point I'm making here is just

1041
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,286
Scott: the thing is the hardware API

1042
01:04:50,427 --> 01:04:51,211
Rym: hard different.

1043
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:53,100
Rym: There's a long sliding scale.

1044
01:04:53,545 --> 01:05:00,396
Rym: And I think there are two factors here, two almost completely separate scales that right now, at least for what we do happen to correlate very strongly.

1045
01:05:00,456 --> 01:05:08,399
Rym: on one side, there's the, is this fun for me scale, which happens to correlate to, is this just coding around libraries and gluing things together?

1046
01:05:09,422 --> 01:05:18,445
Rym: And if we could somehow, I don't know if it's possible, break the two sliders so that it's fun to glue, which you know, what an example of that is.

1047
01:05:18,465 --> 01:05:25,358
Rym: Well, if everyone doubler and a very simple way, you, you made it really fun to glue things together.

1048
01:05:25,419 --> 01:05:28,637
Rym: Of course, you sacrificed every other aspect of gluing things together to do it.

1049
01:05:30,922 --> 01:05:31,244
Scott: I don't know.

1050
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:32,811
Scott: The thing is, right.

1051
01:05:32,952 --> 01:05:38,694
Scott: It's like when you glue things together, you have to do that little bit of work in between the, in between the two things you're gluing, right?

1052
01:05:38,714 --> 01:05:40,891
Scott: To make the match, to get the square peg and the square hole.

1053
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:46,620
Scott: And when you're working, say, to combine Google maps, that combining work is usually really boring and stupid.

1054
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:49,798
Scott: You know, Oh, I have to remove the space from the end of the string.

1055
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:52,940
Scott: Oh, I have to parse this XML to get the name of something, right?

1056
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,066
Scott: It's just really stupid shit.

1057
01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:56,480
Scott: If you're doing something on a lower level, right?

1058
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:02,181
Scott: That in between work of gluing, say a GPU to a game or something like that, right?

1059
01:06:02,201 --> 01:06:05,880
Scott: That in between square peg, you know, turn the square peg into a circle peg.

1060
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:10,299
Scott: So if it's in a circle, whole work is actually far more interesting work.

1061
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:13,600
Rym: Well, I think in that case, it's a lot more complicated.

1062
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,557
Scott: There's actually problems to solve rather than just things to do.

1063
01:06:17,577 --> 01:06:24,880
Scott: You know, you have to figure out, Oh shit, you know, this GPU only does this and this, you know, so I need to figure out something.

1064
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:32,499
Scott: There's actually a problem to solve as opposed to just, you know, uh, a magic word to figure out in some documentation.

1065
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:37,658
Rym: Well, you could go back to what you were doing before when you were working on, you know, like embedded stuff, batteries, things like that.

1066
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:37,860
Rym: Yeah.

1067
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,755
Scott: But I have to go figure out how to work on that again.

1068
01:06:40,775 --> 01:06:42,263
Scott: It's been so long, right?

1069
01:06:42,323 --> 01:06:44,374
Scott: That my skills in that area are depleted.

1070
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:45,319
Scott: I need to rebuild them.

1071
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,740
Scott: But yeah, in general, it's just, this is the way the programming is going.

1072
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,092
Scott: And I wonder, you know, it could be, there's going to be goods and there's going to be bads.

1073
01:06:54,152 --> 01:06:57,099
Scott: And I hope that, uh, we can, you know, figure something out.

1074
01:06:57,462 --> 01:07:04,320
Rym: I think good in the long run, but not for, I think from third factors and just the advance of technology, making things act differently.

1075
01:07:04,882 --> 01:07:10,119
Rym: I think the really important part of this is not the technology because the wrappers will eventually be really good.

1076
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:17,536
Rym: The problem is going to be the fun part because it'll never be more fun for people like you to write code, no matter how good the glue gets.

1077
01:07:17,556 --> 01:07:18,380
Rym: Yeah.

1078
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,470
Scott: I think that's why you look at like, what was that game with the, uh, the alchemy game?

1079
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:22,632
Scott: Yeah.

1080
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:26,363
Rym: The alchemy game, the codex of alchemical engineering is basically just doing the fun part of coding.

1081
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:27,556
Rym: I mean, I enjoyed that game.

1082
01:07:27,596 --> 01:07:27,960
Scott: Basically.

1083
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,298
Scott: That's the epitome of what the fun part of coding is.

1084
01:07:30,621 --> 01:07:32,050
Rym: Is that the epitome of a good game too?

1085
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:33,440
Rym: Because look, it was simple enough.

1086
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,428
Rym: You could brute force it.

1087
01:07:34,448 --> 01:07:35,839
Rym: It was a game that anyone could play.

1088
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:38,472
Rym: And yet it rewarded mastery.

1089
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:41,545
Rym: If mastery was your goal, yeah.

1090
01:07:41,585 --> 01:07:55,037
Scott: So that's, you know, that's the kind of code I like writing, but nowadays is pretty much like, imagine if you basically, it's like playing the codex of alchemical engineering with cheating pieces, you know, like, like, but they don't work just quite right.

1091
01:07:55,379 --> 01:07:55,600
Rym: Yeah.

1092
01:07:56,022 --> 01:08:00,114
Scott: But it's all, it's basically if you had that plus cheating pieces, well, the game becomes sort of boring.

1093
01:08:00,134 --> 01:08:02,979
Scott: It's like, oh, I just take this cheating piece and I win this level up.

1094
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:04,730
Scott: Here's the piece that beats level two.

1095
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,420
Scott: Oh, I need to beat level three.

1096
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,847
Scott: There's 10 level three.

1097
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:10,180
Rym: You'll have five pieces and they're all black boxes.

1098
01:08:10,422 --> 01:08:12,960
Rym: And you put something in one side and do something to it and stuff comes out.

1099
01:08:13,201 --> 01:08:15,812
Scott: No, you go on Google and you say, which piece beats level three?

1100
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:18,109
Scott: and someone says, oh, piece number four beats level three.

1101
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:23,368
Rym: But then someone else says, yeah, it only beats level three at first, but if you let it keep running, it randomly spits out salt.

1102
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:25,319
Rym: I just keep spitting out salt.

1103
01:08:27,384 --> 01:08:33,031
Scott: That's cause it's something bad in that black box that you'll never look inside something bad in method.

1104
01:08:33,352 --> 01:08:48,676
Scott: I think what I would just think anyone out there who was coding, you know, at the high level of gluing libraries together, my message to you is to just look when you're using something, let's say, you know, you're, you're writing something in, uh, you know, I guess, you know, try to use open source stuff.

1105
01:08:48,716 --> 01:08:50,106
Scott: First of all, that way you can look at code.

1106
01:08:50,608 --> 01:09:01,091
Scott: And then when you do use an open source library, let's say you use pie game to make a game, or let's say you use Ruby on rails to make a website, or let's say you use, you know, uh, Apache, right.

1107
01:09:01,173 --> 01:09:10,144
Scott: To make a web, you know, something, go look at the code of the thing you're using, cause that will help you a get a better understanding of what your program is really doing.

1108
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:10,908
Scott: Right.

1109
01:09:11,671 --> 01:09:13,319
Scott: Look at the code of Ruby on rails.

1110
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:15,346
Scott: Look at the code of pie game, you know?

1111
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:21,920
Scott: Uh, and then when you need to, don't be afraid to modify that underlying code because you know what?

1112
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:24,139
Scott: That underlying code is written by schmucks just like us.

1113
01:09:24,522 --> 01:09:26,399
Scott: They're not some geniuses who are better than we are.

1114
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,560
Scott: They're just other coders who decided to actually write something underneath.

1115
01:09:30,001 --> 01:09:36,756
Scott: You know, if you have maybe like some of them are geniuses, some of them are, but even so, the code is probably, you know, it's there.

1116
01:09:36,837 --> 01:09:37,319
Scott: You can read it.

1117
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,475
Rym: The thing is geniuses, the code's probably really understandable.

1118
01:09:41,019 --> 01:09:41,220
Scott: Yeah.

1119
01:09:41,461 --> 01:09:44,357
Scott: And even then even geniuses, the code isn't perfect.

1120
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:46,390
Scott: You know, it has gotta be something wrong with it.

1121
01:09:46,591 --> 01:09:57,553
Scott: Or you can, even if there's nothing wrong with it, you can probably, there's probably ways that you can modify that underlying code for your specific use case to make it a lot more useful to you.

1122
01:09:57,573 --> 01:10:06,102
Scott: And in which case, do it because, you know, as opposed to writing a huge, you might as a write a huge block of code on your side and the outside of the black box.

1123
01:10:06,122 --> 01:10:12,589
Scott: You could just write like one line inside the black box.

1124
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:13,413
Scott: that does everything.

1125
01:10:13,493 --> 01:10:18,054
Scott: So why would you, you know, just cause you're afraid to look inside, you've written way more code than you need to.

1126
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:18,659
Scott: Don't do that.

1127
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,377
Rym: Let's just return device.urandom add that to everything.

1128
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:21,659
Scott: Yeah.

1129
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:31,668
Scott: So look inside the black boxes when they're open source, fool around with them, learn how, you know, and then you'll be able to write your own libraries and maybe you'll write the next thing that everyone uses.

1130
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:32,855
Scott: That's like Ruby on rails.

1131
01:10:32,936 --> 01:10:36,900
Scott: That'll be, you know, as opposed to just being the next user of Ruby on rails.

1132
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:47,953
Rym: I just think the key is to focus on the enjoyment part because if coders want to enjoy this one type of programming, as long as they know that it is like, it exists and they can still do it despite the glue.

1133
01:10:47,973 --> 01:10:50,311
Rym: and the glue will still get done because that's where all the money is.

1134
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:52,928
Rym: The money's in the glue, the fun is in the rest.

1135
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:56,139
Rym: And as long as coders like to code, the rest is going to get done.

1136
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,758
Scott: Now the thing is the money isn't actually in the glue, right?

1137
01:10:58,778 --> 01:11:00,246
Scott: Well, I guess it depends.

1138
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:04,526
Rym: If you want to make between, you know, 60 and 110 if you want a job, right?

1139
01:11:04,586 --> 01:11:09,489
Scott: If you are a gluer, you will probably get a job, right?

1140
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:11,800
Scott: That pays money like me and Rym, right?

1141
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:17,211
Scott: However, if you want to make a product that you can sell, you want to make the piece that is being glued.

1142
01:11:17,271 --> 01:11:19,340
Scott: Google makes pieces to glue, right?

1143
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:26,217
Scott: Django and Ruby on rails are pieces that you glue and those people who make these things are making mad bank, right?

1144
01:11:26,378 --> 01:11:32,492
Scott: You know, through having consulting businesses or selling the product straight up or selling services associated with the product, right?

1145
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:36,896
Scott: So, you know, there is money in making the pieces to be glued, right?

1146
01:11:36,997 --> 01:11:39,089
Scott: And there, you know, Twitter is a piece to be glued.

1147
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:42,527
Scott: Think about it that Facebook is a piece to be glued, not the glue itself.

1148
01:11:43,371 --> 01:11:47,780
Scott: And there is jobs, you know, if you want to work for someone else in being a gluer.

1149
01:11:48,281 --> 01:11:55,425
Scott: So there's money all around, but a lot more people make money being gluers than making, you know, popsicle sticks.

1150
01:11:55,527 --> 01:11:56,660
Rym: There's no more demand for it.

1151
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:05,923
Rym: I mean, I guess when I say that's where the money is, is that 99% of what businesses need and what the economy, what everyone needs is two things that aren't glued together to get glued together.

1152
01:12:05,943 --> 01:12:07,960
Rym: So that's always going to be where the money is.

1153
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,000
Rym: Cause someone's always going to say, I want my sales force to connect to my blah.

1154
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:18,877
Rym: And then someone's gonna have to write some JMX adapter to or JDBC thing to like get the data, massage it and stick it in the other thing.

1155
01:12:19,078 --> 01:12:19,219
Scott: Yep.

1156
01:12:19,781 --> 01:12:25,320
Rym: And a lot of these things will get more and more custom as people, you know, internal, like I got to connect my particular sales force.

1157
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:30,025
Rym: That's these weird fields to this particular ticketing system that has these particular fields.

1158
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:30,407
Rym: Yep.

1159
01:12:30,688 --> 01:12:32,577
Rym: And that'll never be fun to do for anyone.

1160
01:12:32,959 --> 01:12:33,140
Rym: Nope.

1161
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:36,233
Rym: I think that's good enough.

1162
01:12:36,253 --> 01:12:36,639
Scott: That was good.

1163
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:45,700
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1164
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,518
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1165
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:55,889
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1166
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,808
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1167
01:12:58,929 --> 01:13:03,573
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

1170
01:13:08,306 --> 01:13:11,380
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1171
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,479
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1172
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:39,090
Scott: And I purposefully didn't put chase Gordon in this meta moment.

1173
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,929
Scott: I was going to do him in the Wednesday, Wednesday.

1174
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:47,770
Rym: I noticed something strange just because the people pointed it out in this, you stream, you basically close your eyes while you're doing the show.

1175
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:48,233
Rym: Yeah.

1176
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:49,000
Scott: What am I looking at?

1177
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,730
Rym: I don't know, but it just, it kind of, it looks funny cause your eyes are just closed.

1178
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,509
Rym: You're kind of just like looking down like I'm doing GeekNights now.

1179
01:13:55,011 --> 01:14:00,278
Rym: I'm nodding and I'm acting like I'm talking to someone, but as a closed, yeah, I'm not looking at anything.

1180
01:14:00,882 --> 01:14:02,330
Scott: If I was on video, I keep the eyes open.

1181
01:14:04,193 --> 01:14:06,890
Scott: Well, you know, I think I kept my eyes open when we did the show the other day.

1182
01:14:07,532 --> 01:14:07,773
Scott: Yeah.

1183
01:14:07,813 --> 01:14:10,610
Rym: So, you know, see what you should do is close your eyes during a panel.

1184
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:11,576
Rym: Cause it's really unnerving.

1185
01:14:12,602 --> 01:14:13,306
Scott: Why would I do that?

1186
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,281
Scott: Imagine that if I, yeah, I don't close my eyes during a panel.

1187
01:14:15,301 --> 01:14:17,870
Scott: Maybe if we did a whole panel, I don't think I've ever closed my eyes during a panel.

1188
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,097
Rym: And we did close our eyes.

1189
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,010
Scott: Cause I always look at the back wall or I look at people in the audience or hot girls in the audience or whatever.

1190
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:23,575
Rym: What if we did that?

1191
01:14:23,595 --> 01:14:24,970
Rym: We just, you know, we know what our slides are.

1192
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:25,735
Rym: We haven't memorized.

1193
01:14:25,755 --> 01:14:28,775
Rym: If we just kept our eyes closed for the whole panel, we'd fall off the stage.

1194
01:14:28,815 --> 01:14:30,164
Scott: You go, oops, trip over the wire.

1195
01:14:30,184 --> 01:14:30,767
Scott: That'd be great.

1196
01:14:30,989 --> 01:14:33,190
Scott: No, you can fall off if you want.
