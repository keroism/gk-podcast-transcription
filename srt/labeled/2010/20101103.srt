1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,287
Rym: It's Wednesday November 3rd.

2
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:10,970
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,058
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,587
Rym: tonight 2010 we review eaten of the East.

5
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:24,230
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,650
Rym: I Gotta say the year we've had like five years of GeekNights.

7
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:37,785
Scott: I don't think it sounds good when you say the year And it's also not necessary because if someone I'd like on the daily show any like real show.

8
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:42,921
Scott: It's like September 28th 2014 sounds good when they say because of their style.

9
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:47,721
Scott: if you could reformat the Opener somehow to get the year in I think it's fine.

10
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:49,087
Rym: You know it's blah blah blah.

11
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:49,991
Rym: 2010.

12
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,539
Rym: How does 2010 in any way sound bad?

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,603
Scott: It sounds bad?

14
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:53,864
Rym: Why?

15
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:54,807
Rym: what's bad about it?

16
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:55,730
Rym: It just sounds bad.

17
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,098
Scott: I was aesthetically displeasing to you.

18
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:00,205
Rym: I don't think anyone else cares.

19
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:01,550
Scott: I think it is not necessary.

20
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:05,170
Rym: I think it's very necessary because we've had five years of show.

21
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,140
Scott: Figure out what year the show they're listening to is.

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,722
Scott: I mean it's.

23
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:11,211
Scott: you know it might be hard to figure out the date and the Month.

24
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,499
Rym: it's all the iTunes users though.

25
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,525
Rym: They'll never come to the website.

26
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:14,190
Rym: They'll have no idea.

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,153
Rym: There's no way.

28
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:18,265
Scott: if they're using iTunes the date is in fucking iTunes.

29
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:21,323
Rym: only if they look at it I know it's also on your iPod.

30
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:28,824
Rym: Yeah, they don't look at it It's all right, but in there if they really need to know what year it is then they'll look Yeah, mark my words someday like Otakon.

31
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:33,890
Rym: like four years from now Someone's gonna call us and be like you said you were gonna be at Otakon.

32
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,542
Scott: That's their own damn fault for being a Moran.

33
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:43,692
Rym: see I can agree with a lot of your points But I can't agree that it somehow sounds bad to say the year It.

34
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:46,001
Scott: it sounds bad the way we have it structured.

35
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:47,970
Scott: why restructure it to get the year in there?

36
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,519
Rym: It's you know Wednesday November 3rd 2010.

37
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,926
Rym: No Scott sucks, and this is GeekNights.

38
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:56,650
Scott: It's no good.

39
00:01:57,254 --> 00:02:08,249
Rym: So I have been watching a bunch of anime lately And I've been trying to use the more legitimate means of watching anime Which doesn't matter because half the anime I want to watch aren't released in the US.

40
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:14,430
Scott: anime I'm watching right now is galaxy railways, which I bought completely legitimately from those incredibly inexpensive DVDs.

41
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:21,709
Scott: Yeah, and apparently there's a whole this is only the first 20 some odd episodes And there's actually a lot more that are not on DVD.

42
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:25,003
Rym: And I just got my try gun box set that I paid $30 for.

43
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:25,304
Rym: re-released.

44
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:27,473
Scott: That's less.

45
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:30,667
Scott: It's like only a little over a dollar per that per episode.

46
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:31,410
Scott: That's a good price.

47
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:34,130
Rym: Yeah, I think it's definitely worth it for one of the best anime ever.

48
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:39,150
Rym: I I hope it stands up because I haven't seen it in about seven years.

49
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,686
Scott: I haven't seen it in a long time, but I think it'll hold many times back then.

50
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:45,272
Rym: I think it'll hold up We'll see.

51
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:49,430
Rym: but so I'm watching that and I've been watching Eden of the East which you know obviously reviewing.

52
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:56,290
Rym: But I've been trying to watch a lot of anime through the anime news networks kind of hobo Hulu equivalent.

53
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,012
Rym: Why are you doing that?

54
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,036
Scott: Why don't you use a crunchyroll?

55
00:02:58,497 --> 00:03:00,845
Rym: So, you know, the East was released legitimately.

56
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:01,889
Rym: crunchyroll is not gonna have it.

57
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:05,646
Rym: Oh crunchyroll doesn't have it now because it's released legitimately.

58
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,390
Rym: I could get it.

59
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,997
Rym: I mean there are towards I could get.

60
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,324
Rym: so I go to the anime news network thing Which links to like the different websites and they've got a million anime.

61
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:15,590
Rym: You can just watch them subbed.

62
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,436
Rym: They've got dubs for a lot of the shows.

63
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:21,090
Rym: It's not that bad except the video quality is pretty low.

64
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:22,616
Rym: It takes forever to load.

65
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,930
Rym: the ads don't work at all.

66
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,428
Scott: It's a good thing.

67
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:31,330
Rym: It is a good thing except that every time it comes to the point where the ad would play and crunchyroll's ads works.

68
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,904
Scott: They're always watching these stupid skittles ads.

69
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,582
Rym: over and over again A pop-up appears over the video that you have to close.

70
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:44,675
Rym: that basically says trying to load ad Oh, and then it just immediately plays the rest of the episode Alrighty, so I can't really complain about that.

71
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,559
Rym: Except the pop-up keeps coming this kind of annoying.

72
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,653
Scott: and Well, imagine an ad every time that pop-up shows up.

73
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,160
Scott: and how glad you are is just a pop-up.

74
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,565
Rym: Even if the East has a really good opener It has that Oasis song.

75
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:59,279
Rym: like it's a solid anime opener the kind like a ghost in the shell openers.

76
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,509
Rym: Well, I'll watch it every single episode.

77
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:02,915
Rym: Like I'll just watch it every time.

78
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:04,926
Scott: I didn't watch it every time I watched it enough times.

79
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:11,112
Rym: Yeah, they changed the opener Because they couldn't afford to pay Oasis for the rights to the song.

80
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,460
Scott: How come the Japanese could afford it apparent?

81
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,627
Rym: I don't know what happened in Japan, but at least in the American release They changed it to this Japanese song.

82
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:24,427
Scott: and how come when the Japanese people pay how come that doesn't include the rights for The showing the show in every country?

83
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:26,996
Rym: because DDR was never even licensed in the US.

84
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,726
Scott: I know right it's like if I buy.

85
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:40,292
Scott: if I make a movie and I pay a Rym for a song he made to put in my movie Then I sell that movie in other countries.

86
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,939
Scott: I shouldn't have to pay again.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,926
Rym: Yeah, but copyright laws really broken.

88
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:47,980
Rym: so bullshit, but they made you know, right boy they made an opener.

89
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:49,972
Rym: It's they sorry.

90
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:50,799
Rym: Hi Ami sang it.

91
00:04:51,081 --> 00:05:05,236
Rym: It's really really stupid and it makes the show feel like a crappy kind of standard show Like watching the opener with that music has such a different vibe that I probably wouldn't have bothered with the show right away Had I seen that first?

92
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,460
Rym: Have the reason I watched Eden of the East was that I watched the Japanese opener and I was really intrigued.

93
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:13,352
Rym: Uh-huh, you know the abuse of greatness and all that it was.

94
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:15,019
Scott: isn't this the main bit for our show?

95
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,032
Scott: Yeah, so are you wasting it in your news section?

96
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:19,648
Rym: cuz I'm reviewing this meta stuff That has almost nothing to do with the show.

97
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:25,939
Rym: Well, you're reviewing the opener of the show right now Yeah, and the opener of the show is not on the legal way to watch the goddamn show.

98
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:31,220
Rym: So I just pirated blu-ray rips of Eden of the East and much better idea much better idea.

99
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,688
Rym: There's no broken ad that pops up every few.

100
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,149
Rym: Let's see.

101
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,654
Scott: Why are people pirating things?

102
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,340
Scott: because legitimate stuff sucks.

103
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:46,000
Rym: It was faster to download the torrent the blu-ray HD rip than it was if I added up all the delays.

104
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,720
Rym: I'm trying to watch the show on anime news network because it takes forever to load even on my files.

105
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,205
Scott: I don't know why crunchyroll doesn't have it.

106
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:54,153
Scott: I mean crunchyroll has other legitimate things.

107
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:57,582
Rym: I know there's definitely the Legit right.

108
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:58,465
Rym: It's trying something.

109
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:03,278
Rym: I mean this anime news network thing even pops up like watch it legally.

110
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,115
Rym: Oh, oh Yeah.

111
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:10,876
Rym: So, I don't know I'm not impressed but there is a lot of anime there and you can.

112
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:20,280
Rym: I would recommend if you're a punk Kid and you don't want to use bit torrent you can watch the show with the same impact on the anime industry Technically legally and still not see ads.

113
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:24,225
Scott: Well So check this out, right?

114
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:24,787
Scott: I'm checking.

115
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:30,531
Scott: normally when this remakes or nostalgia trips or whatever I'm like, ah, whatever fuck that shit.

116
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:31,415
Scott: All right, who cares?

117
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:37,491
Scott: but Somebody is gonna make a remake of Thundercats.

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,937
Rym: Wait, so Thundercats as far as I can tell was just an extended adolescence metaphor where his penis was a sword.

119
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:48,519
Scott: Yes.

120
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:55,480
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but anyway, the thing is about Thundercats why it is different from the other kid grew to symbolize his adulthood.

121
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,309
Scott: Is that why I was a kid, right?

122
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:04,292
Scott: I mean I liked all those shows the Voltron Transformers I liked GI Joe, but I really only liked the movie.

123
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:07,462
Rym: I didn't.

124
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:10,735
Scott: actually really I wasn't really much about GI Joe at all, but I wasn't.

125
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:11,860
Scott: you know, the other stuff was all great.

126
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:13,550
Scott: I love mask and he-man.

127
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:20,560
Scott: I did not enjoy Transformers that much but Thundercats was like for me at least was like the number one.

128
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,505
Scott: I mean Voltron.

129
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,238
Scott: the robot is the most powerful and of all nothing.

130
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:30,625
Rym: to be bold It is telling why I had far more Centurions toys than I did Thundercats toys Yeah, but thing is I most?

131
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:33,940
Scott: I mean, you know how every toy set had like a big toy, right?

132
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,886
Scott: Ninja Turtles had the sewer right?

133
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,656
Rym: I had that no and it was really chintzy.

134
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:43,815
Scott: and like The techno drone, you know transformers you could get fortress maximum.

135
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:45,260
Rym: I never had that right?

136
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,819
Scott: I mean there was always a big toy.

137
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:55,900
Scott: the only thing I ever had the big toy for Was the Thundercats lair with the friggin flashlight in the mouth and the opening hands of the tanks that rolled out.

138
00:07:56,181 --> 00:08:08,074
Scott: That's the only big toy for any of the action figures that I had and I had Frickin lino and panthro and the kids and I had this mum-ra playset where you would spin around and There'd be mother be old mum-ra.

139
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:08,779
Scott: It would be you know.

140
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Scott: Oh, I remember ads for that and you'd spin it around and then the big mom-ra would come out.

141
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,011
Scott: And then I also had the big mum-ra - and I had fucking.

142
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:18,496
Rym: I'd see the ads for that crap.

143
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:23,120
Scott: like right after double-day I had the snake mutant guy and the jackal mutant and I didn't have the bird mutant.

144
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:24,791
Scott: Anyway, I had I was.

145
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,139
Scott: Thundercats was like number one.

146
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,753
Rym: I never saw the first episode of Thundercats until a few years ago.

147
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,380
Scott: the first episodes the best ever said it.

148
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,303
Rym: I just never saw it.

149
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:33,869
Scott: It's also a Thundercats movie.

150
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,576
Scott: We're just like a multi-parter situation.

151
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:36,480
Rym: I never saw that either.

152
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,298
Scott: Oh, man, that's actually you know, it's like it's weird cuz but I did see the My Little Pony movie in theaters.

153
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,995
Scott: exciting Yeah, I think I did too.

154
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:45,930
Scott: So this remake of Thundercats, right?

155
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:47,760
Scott: Like why would I get excited about this?

156
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:53,522
Scott: You know There've been other remakes of things recently and they've been hit or miss and I don't really need to pay attention to that much Thunder.

157
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,229
Scott: what is interesting about this remake?

158
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:58,160
Scott: Well so far we have three facts about it.

159
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:01,933
Scott: I mean, there's a whole big article But there's really only three facts in the article that mattered.

160
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:16,491
Scott: fact number one The guy in charge of it is this Jalen ik guy and apparently he's the guy who did Batman brave in the bold cartoon Which is a very popular and well liked cartoon among the nerds, even though I've never seen it the nerds like it So that makes some people happy.

161
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:22,511
Scott: All right fact number two Snarf is in it, but he will only say snarf snarf.

162
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:23,394
Scott: He won't say anything else.

163
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:25,120
Rym: He's not gonna say Sam a flange.

164
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:29,220
Rym: Panther said Sam if I have a snarf could also say Sam a flange.

165
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,585
Scott: The thing is I'm like.

166
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,778
Scott: I kind of kind of understand that cuz you were changing the tone of the show.

167
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:38,472
Scott: if there's a talking Snarf who's sort of like, you know, he's not as he's not a Jar Jar Binks.

168
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:39,455
Rym: He's definitely the.

169
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,200
Rym: I don't know about this character.

170
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,718
Scott: yeah, he you know, he sort of throws it off if you go with the darker theme, which is what it's going for.

171
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,226
Scott: but I Like I actually don't find snarf to be annoying.

172
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,749
Scott: I think he's just fine, you know.

173
00:09:51,641 --> 00:10:02,871
Scott: anyway, the third and most important fact is that it is a joint venture between Warner Brothers who I guess owns Thundercats now and Studio four degrees C.

174
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:04,077
Rym: Oh shit.

175
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:13,338
Scott: Oh shit that is like doom stamp of platinum 4c is Hot hotness as hotness right.

176
00:10:13,398 --> 00:10:20,970
Scott: all these other remakes did not have like, you know Like huge awesome perfect studio of awesomeness on the list, right?

177
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,039
Scott: You know, so it'll be like that's.

178
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:31,102
Scott: basically it would be equivalently awesome if they said oh, yeah This is a joint venture between Warner Brothers and Studio Ghibli like oh snap.

179
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:35,970
Scott: or if they said yeah So she can come back from the dead to do Thundercats.

180
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:43,689
Rym: You know considering that it's a long adolescence metaphor where the sword is his penis and it grows every time he has to assert himself It should have been guy next.

181
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:46,909
Scott: That would have been a different show.

182
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:49,788
Scott: But anyway, yeah.

183
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:51,802
Scott: So I'm definitely gonna.

184
00:10:51,822 --> 00:11:00,820
Rym: oh, oh my god I got to make a little video mashup now of that scene from the beginning of the Ava movie and Just dub line of saying Thunder Thunder Thunder.

185
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,341
Scott: go for it.

186
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:01,823
Rym: I'll do it.

187
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,310
Scott: But anyway, this is a I'm liking this.

188
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:06,270
Scott: This is looking like it's going in a good direction.

189
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:11,736
Scott: Obviously judgment needs to be withheld until we see the real thing as with all things But I'm gonna.

190
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,644
Scott: I'm slightly looking forward to it.

191
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:16,729
Scott: I'm gonna keep my eye open my eye of Thundera.

192
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,227
Rym: So things of the day.

193
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:39,068
Rym: I fell into a deep nostalgia trip when I was watching something from the 70s and thought it looked really old and Then suddenly felt the urge to look at things from the 80s and 90s and realized that they look just as old.

194
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:47,294
Rym: so I have for you two TV shows that I watch and Enjoyed as a kid.

195
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:50,025
Rym: Alrighty, and it saddens me.

196
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:51,130
Scott: I was just talking about Thundercats.

197
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,380
Scott: Is it Thundercats now?

198
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,529
Rym: as much as this saddens me?

199
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:57,887
Rym: There's a YouTube comment on the first one that says quote better than the stuff on g4.

200
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,525
Scott: Okay, it must be video game related.

201
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,109
Scott: It's Captain N.

202
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:05,124
Rym: I kind of after captain is not better than g4 captain.

203
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:06,028
Rym: that is not better than g4.

204
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,923
Rym: But do you remember game pro TV barely?

205
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,530
Rym: or the one you probably remember video power.

206
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:15,630
Scott: I remember video power excellently.

207
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:20,410
Scott: I was so annoyed about video power because he would end when I got home.

208
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,450
Scott: So I get home and I'd see the velcro and I wouldn't get to see the dude for me.

209
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,060
Rym: It was on before I went to school.

210
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:25,664
Rym: It was not at 6 a.m.

211
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,034
Scott: Oh mine was.

212
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,563
Scott: it was only on right before I got.

213
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:34,569
Scott: I would get up at 545 like the middle middle school kids who got home a half hour an hour earlier got to see it.

214
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,689
Scott: The elementary school kids didn't get to see that shit.

215
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,408
Rym: So all I remembered about the show was kids play real video games and compete and it was awesome and wacky.

216
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:47,050
Rym: and then at the End whoever wins puts down a velcro vest and runs through a mini toy store.

217
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,659
Scott: No You actually had two people on your team and you could.

218
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,218
Scott: you had to take turns going in with the velcro and you had to tag out.

219
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:58,483
Rym: All I remember is that you would velcro games to your chest.

220
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:04,003
Rym: and if you Nintendo games if you made it out before The timer went off you got to keep all those games.

221
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,683
Rym: and if you found the secret game You want a special prize like a neo geo?

222
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:08,810
Rym: Yeah, holy shit.

223
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:12,464
Scott: And I mean think about you're a kid of one.

224
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:22,670
Scott: getting one video game is like Oh, I got one Nintendo game like a month And if that I got a lot less than that like one winner a few months, so you get a video game.

225
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:24,314
Scott: It's like oh my god I got a video.

226
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:25,439
Rym: watch these kids on TV.

227
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:31,690
Scott: if they win this game and they're less like video game every second They're going down the shelf being like game game game game game.

228
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:40,008
Scott: By being good at the games I was already good at he's velcro them to their bodies there this velcro suit and then they have to just leave.

229
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:40,489
Scott: and it's like.

230
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,708
Scott: It's like shoplifting Toys R Us with no consequences.

231
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:51,610
Rym: It was like Hey, remember that old contest with Toys R Us the you get five minutes and as many shopping carts as you.

232
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,482
Scott: Yeah, how many times did that ever actually happen?

233
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:55,367
Rym: Yeah, I believe it did.

234
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:55,769
Rym: I don't know.

235
00:13:56,731 --> 00:14:02,650
Rym: I just I saw videos of people winning it and I remember them like running down aisles with their hands out like grabbing toys.

236
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,070
Scott: I would have gone I would just gone to three aisles and they luckily these aisles are right next to each other.

237
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,813
Scott: So I was there.

238
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:11,769
Scott: us Nintendo tiger now would have gone to the video game aisle, right?

239
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:18,934
Scott: Then right next to the video game aisle and the Toys R Us was the Lego aisle and board game on all the leg And it was the same aisle.

240
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:28,430
Scott: so I could take a Lego from one side and board game from the other and toss him in And then run the hell out before time ran out and I would just get all the biggest Lego I'd be like, you know what?

241
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,817
Scott: $300 Lego castles fuck.

242
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:33,221
Scott: Yes, so you do.

243
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:36,190
Scott: now watching of the biggest castle video power again.

244
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,049
Rym: They're playing Megaman and that's cool.

245
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:45,170
Rym: But these kids I think that this was a pivotal moment for the two contestants in video power because they any good at Megaman.

246
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:46,638
Rym: Hey, they were okay.

247
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,749
Rym: They were as good as every kid was back then.

248
00:14:49,151 --> 00:15:02,556
Rym: They were like the legends but these kids have the look of children who came in with expectations had those shattered saw behind the veil now understand what the real world is and Are going to live productive lives.

249
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:09,390
Scott: then video power served a great purpose even though that is not the purpose It was trying to serve because it served for the greater good.

250
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,953
Rym: You can tell they were so excited because I would have been so excited but they have this look on their faces Like really?

251
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:18,230
Rym: This is what I was excited about for the last three years.

252
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:21,610
Rym: This is what I thought would be the climax of my life.

253
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,204
Scott: Well, I'm sure they got excited when they got to go velcro games Except for the kid who didn't get to go.

254
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:30,117
Rym: Yeah, that's very Blue shirt and he has a bowl cut.

255
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:30,759
Rym: He's kind of funny.

256
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,190
Scott: Yeah, those old video game game shows are were exciting.

257
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,066
Rym: What's weird is that TV from the 70s looks better than TV from the 80s and the 90s?

258
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:45,830
Scott: Well, the reason for that is that TV from the 70s that we still have available to us What we actually have the Masters from the studios.

259
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,070
Scott: But TV from the 80s that we still have available to us was mostly VHS and Betamax recordings.

260
00:15:50,218 --> 00:16:02,117
Scott: Yeah So it actually looked better on the television when you were watching it Even though the technology was largely the same because it was still mostly over-the-air broadcast color TV with no higher resolution or anything Even though the tubes improved in the 80s, right?

261
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,889
Scott: The signal really wasn't any different or better anything like that.

262
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,180
Scott: I guess the cameras also improved at the at the studios.

263
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:18,089
Rym: more than anything is that this old crap is terrible But the faux glamour that they were trying to convey now actually exists and is called the penny arcade Expo.

264
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:21,976
Rym: Anyway, that was a lot but I don't know.

265
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,887
Rym: I very much enjoyed watching these and also did not enjoy watching these.

266
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:33,410
Scott: Alright, so Today is an important day because something is being released and no it is not the Kinect which is also being released at midnight tonight.

267
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:43,082
Scott: Yeah It is a new album from Machine Supremacy and I like to pronounce the name of their band Maki Nai Supremacy because that's how it's spelled even though technically it's Machine Supremacy.

268
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:47,104
Scott: and this is important because What are you doing?

269
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:56,158
Scott: nothing, all right, this is very important because they only release like one album every couple years and Because they are like.

270
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:58,630
Scott: you might as well call them GeekNights the band.

271
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,914
Scott: Alright It is.

272
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:07,266
Scott: they are in a genre of music known as quote Sid metal because they say it is the chip that were the audio chip from the Commodore 64.

273
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:12,808
Rym: one of the few things I want to make happen at PAX that doesn't already happen is to have them do a concert.

274
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,954
Rym: Absolutely I would do almost anything to make that.

275
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:21,844
Scott: and basically they started as a Commodore 64 back cover band doing you know see Commodore remixes of Commodore 64 songs.

276
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:30,570
Scott: and Now they basically they're a metal band that incorporates these unique sound of the Commodore 64 into their music.

277
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:34,410
Scott: And they have a new album that just came out called a view from the end of the world.

278
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,479
Scott: It's also the title of the first song.

279
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:41,557
Scott: All right, but I want to prove to you that That they are GeekNights the band.

280
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:47,584
Scott: All right, and I don't know if they listen to GeekNights or what the hell But here are the lyrics to the.

281
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:53,123
Scott: the second Song on the on the album, which is called force feedback.

282
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,207
Scott: You ready for these lyrics room?

283
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:55,534
Scott: I'm ready All right, these are.

284
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,363
Scott: these might as well have been written by GeekNights.

285
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:58,006
Scott: Are you ready for this?

286
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,004
Scott: Okay Take a look across this vast uncharted battlefield.

287
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:02,667
Scott: I'm not gonna sing.

288
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:10,830
Scott: by the way You still don't know your enemy a bunch of pissed-off freaks with infinite mad skills and a newfound taste for blood.

289
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,279
Scott: We made this life.

290
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:13,386
Scott: You have no place here.

291
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:21,930
Scott: No, right This is the world you're in and this is where ours begins a borderless nation of thoughts to replace your Walden existence in space.

292
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:25,099
Scott: Sure, you already know that your age was long ago.

293
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,190
Scott: We augment reality online and you hail from ancient times.

294
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:31,258
Scott: We are like sleeper cells.

295
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:32,402
Scott: We hide in plain sight.

296
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:34,250
Scott: if you can't see you cannot fight.

297
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:39,250
Scott: This is a war between our culture and your laws with millions born into the cause.

Rym: Any other things of course as just as zombies are getting so played out.

324
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:35,710
Rym: Walking Dead's got his TV show now and zombies are like having this mainstream.

325
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,077
Scott: Yeah, I'm probably gonna watch that when I go home.

00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:39,348
Rym: I was gonna watch it, but I got a game night tonight.

327

Scott: There might be some GeekNights delays in a few weeks because it's gonna be Thanksgiving in the u.s.

331
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,470
Scott: We're gonna be eating turkeys and shit, which means you can't really podcast when you're full of turkey.

332
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,387
Scott: You could be sleeping and it's not because of whatever chemical that's tripped a fan.

333
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:00,170
Scott: That's something's bullshit.

334
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:00,975
Scott: It doesn't make you go sleep.

335
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:02,524
Rym: So Eden of the East he got.

336
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:05,776
Rym: she know Eden is Pretty much the newest anime.

337
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:12,123
Rym: I've watched all the way through almost all the way through in a long time Other than like, you know stuff from the 90s.

338
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:18,270
Scott: Yeah, I watched the first episode of the show a long ways back like maybe a year ago.

339
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,450
Scott: I think we all that many watched it together and I was like, oh, that's a really interesting and unique premise.

340
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:24,474
Scott: I'm interested in that.

341
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:25,498
Scott: I didn't finish watching you.

342
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,891
Scott: I just stopped and then recently I went back to it and I finished the whole Thing.

343
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:29,253
Rym: Yep.

344
00:21:29,374 --> 00:21:35,930
Rym: So the plot of Eden of the East not to spoil anything This is all pretty much first episode second episode stuff to see you.

345
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,813
Rym: You know what you're getting into.

346
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:42,708
Rym: it's the kind of show that you can sell to someone just by explaining the present the the whole That just explaining the premise the premise.

347
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:47,635
Rym: Girl from Japan is in America Standing for to the White House.

348
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:53,094
Rym: out of nowhere comes a naked dude with a cell phone a gun and amnesia Whoa.

349
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,976
Rym: And that's pretty much the plot.

350
00:21:57,578 --> 00:21:58,622
Rym: why is that guy naked?

351
00:21:58,983 --> 00:21:59,966
Rym: what's with the cell phone?

352
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:01,010
Rym: Why do you have a gun?

353
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,450
Scott: Yeah, you know the girls just like a normal Japanese tourist girl.

354
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,373
Scott: She's not like.

355
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:10,007
Rym: I'd argue that she's desperately cute and not like the main girl characters.

356
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:10,750
Rym: a lot of other anime.

357
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:14,870
Scott: She's I mean, she's not stupid in my way right like oh save me.

358
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,859
Scott: She's like a normal person who can take care of herself.

359
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,970
Scott: Yeah, but she's also not a. She's not crazy or weird or anything, you know.

360
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:39,083
Scott: she's intelligent and just a smart normal person and the only reason that she's there alone is because she was on like a trip with her school like a graduation trip or something and she She decided that she was gonna like, you know, they went to New York I think and she decided to take a side trip to DC because she want.

361
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:43,149
Scott: she thought that the White House is like the center Of the world and she wanted to see the center of the world.

362
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:45,321
Scott: You know, she had like a thing about it.

363
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:48,363
Scott: She's like well, I'm here I'm gonna go check it out and then go back on my own.

364
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:49,270
Scott: so she did so.

365
00:22:49,672 --> 00:23:00,850
Rym: What it's really about which is also not a spoiler because you get this pretty much right away Dude has a cell phone that has eight point two billion dot yen, which is like a hundred million dollars Which actually isn't that much money?

366
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:08,827
Rym: It's I'll take it and he has to spend it all and he'll die when he spends it all and he'll die if he doesn't Spend it all and he has to save Japan with it.

367
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:11,802
Scott: Well, yeah, and it's basically the phone.

368
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:16,630
Scott: he can call up on the phone and get anything He wants like he's in fact a sell-a-sell.

369
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:18,942
Rym: Skip all the kind of details.

370
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,410
Scott: you can call anything on the phone.

371
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:25,510
Scott: He could just be like kill so-and-so and then suddenly something will happen that will result in that person.

372
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,021
Rym: There's a great point where he's tested out and he calls the phone.

373
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,554
Rym: He's like, yeah, he basically says yeah I'd love the Prime Minister to say uncle.

374
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:39,426
Rym: and there's this live conference and the Prime Minister like gets a he's watching Japanese C-SPAN and then uncle uncle uncle.

375
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:44,357
Scott: And it's like why And it totally worked.

376
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:48,215
Rym: and it's this huge kind of spy Conspiracy technology.

377
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:52,025
Rym: half of it's about Google goggles and it goes in a lot of directions.

378
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,710
Rym: You really wouldn't have expected from the first episode.

379
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,437
Scott: Yeah, it's where it's like.

380
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:56,668
Scott: the first episode was so great And I just wanted it to go.

381
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,990
Scott: Basically, like what I wanted was to take the premise of the first episode and attack it straight on full force.

382
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:19,590
Scott: But it sort of diverges and gets into these other side Tangents and it's sort of like, you know There's all sorts of stuff going on and which thing is the primary thing sort of changes like it goes down these branches along the Way and gets away from the main thing of what the hell with the sell us out shit, right?

383
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,430
Scott: You know and naked guy who lost all his memories showing up, you know, it doesn't stick with that.

384
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:32,962
Rym: There's just something about that Naked dude with the gun of cell phone and amnesia and you throw that in in the first five minutes of the first episode of a Show with no backstory at all.

385
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:38,826
Scott: That's awesome But they sort of get away from it a little bit, you know, he's not naked.

386
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:40,887
Rym: much longer though Johnny's come up a lot.

387
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:47,490
Rym: In fact, I would say that's what the show is really about because in that episode There's a lot of English being spoken.

388
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:54,930
Scott: Surprisingly well for an anime there it is strange how much like English speaking is going on like the helicopter pilots all speak English.

389
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,464
Rym: Yeah, that female cop who's like, let me see your Johnny which I assumed meant.

390
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:03,557
Rym: Let me see your ID And he showed her as Johnny.

391
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:06,730
Rym: and then later there's a Johnny thief who yeah, Johnny thieves steal penises.

392
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:17,837
Rym: Yeah Well, she murders guys and cuts their penises off either before or after and she had a good reason for doing it I guess somewhat kinda.

393
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:21,630
Rym: that's one of those side plots that I really didn't care about.

394
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,132
Rym: I didn't.

395
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:25,624
Scott: I really have much to do with the main and it's not even that many episodes, right?

396
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:29,330
Scott: It's like 13 11 It's 11 episodes really it's not.

397
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:31,298
Scott: So have it.

398
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:32,730
Scott: Yeah, I haven't watched the movies either.

399
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:35,262
Scott: I heard that they were bad, but I don't know I got to watch them.

400
00:25:35,503 --> 00:25:36,830
Rym: So a little bit about this show though.

401
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:40,070
Rym: It's a production IG which is a plus one already.

402
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,370
Scott: Yeah, that's like, you know studio 4c is plus 10 but production IG is plus a lot.

403
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,823
Rym: Anyway, they did stand-alone complex and it was on no automata and they also did.

404
00:25:48,843 --> 00:25:50,127
Scott: Oh, no, that was all studio 4c.

405
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:50,609
Scott: Nevermind.

406
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,063
Rym: So The director Kenji Kamiyama is actually pretty well known.

407
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,790
Rym: It looks like he worked with Satoshi Konoha bunch.

408
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:59,274
Rym: He worked on minipato Jin ro.

409
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:03,750
Rym: he also happened to direct screenplay and write standalone complex.

410
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,999
Scott: This is a winning bus production IG rights.

411
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:06,662
Scott: He must work there.

412
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:08,730
Scott: Yeah, so there's obviously a winning guy.

413
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,169
Scott: They put the a-team at production IG on this job.

414
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:17,083
Rym: now Sometimes when you say like oh so and so like so and so's show like this guy directed this It's easy to say like.

415
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:17,850
Rym: oh he directed it.

416
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,023
Rym: But all these other people is based on a manga or anything.

417
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:20,989
Scott: just he just wrote it.

418
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:28,230
Rym: He wrote the script the screenplay did the storyboards for a bunch of the episodes was the original creator and the director.

419
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,049
Scott: So who wrote the movies that people supposedly say also him?

420
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,477
Rym: Okay, so this is basically him.

421
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,290
Rym: all the way except for the character designs themselves.

422
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:42,166
Rym: They actually got Chica Umino who did a honey and clover and I love the character designs.

423
00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:43,873
Scott: Okay, they're really good They're pretty good.

424
00:26:43,913 --> 00:26:44,557
Scott: The girls cute.

425
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,205
Scott: Well characters are distinct.

426
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:47,010
Scott: You can tell them apart.

427
00:26:47,291 --> 00:27:07,541
Rym: Saki the main character, you know, the girl who meets the naked guy with a cell phone gun and amnesia is Really cute with like kind of this big cheeks and a wide face with like a wide thin smile And all the characters do this thing which I mean I haven't really read much of honey and clover but Emily's read a lot where they'll like put their hands up in an X and Like make a funny face whenever anything scary happens.

428
00:27:07,822 --> 00:27:09,448
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's a classic thing.

429
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:14,805
Rym: Yeah That's basically the closest to super deformed or anime BS that the show gets to.

430
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:16,090
Rym: it's really cute.

431
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:19,917
Scott: So is this a good show?

432
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,063
Scott: I think it's.

433
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:22,630
Scott: I think it's mostly a good show, right?

434
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,430
Scott: It's like it's not an amazing show like oh my gosh.

435
00:27:25,772 --> 00:27:29,110
Scott: But I think what it is is sort of has a little bit of the Death Note problem, right?

436
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:39,219
Scott: Cuz in Death Note, there's like a two parts of Death Note, you know There's the first half and the second half and the first half is so good that even though the second half I still think is good is not as good as the first half.

437
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:47,025
Rym: the relativity of it makes it seem like the second half Like if I drank a glass of $500 Kings fee and then after it I had $100 Kings fee the $100 Kings fee.

438
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:55,288
Rym: It's still really really really good and expensive and valuable, but I just had the $500 Kings fee.

439
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:56,090
Rym: exactly, right?

440
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,790
Scott: So I think the first episode of Eden of the East remember there's only 11 right is a really good episode.

441
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:04,422
Scott: I like you can't have a better first episode of anime.

442
00:28:04,442 --> 00:28:08,861
Scott: that makes me want to see the rest of the show But after that it sort of goes.

443
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,407
Scott: it doesn't go down in the shitter.

444
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:11,210
Scott: It just goes down.

445
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:14,690
Scott: You know, it's not as it doesn't stick with what it started.

446
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:23,748
Rym: the rest of the show does not give me the same feeling because what I liked about the show and they're mostly in the first episode that one the character is really cute and they react in surprising ways and the plot was interesting.

447
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:31,438
Rym: and aside from all the Johnny's there were a ton of movie references that were kind of integrated with the plot of Eden of the East.

448
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:37,295
Rym: but we're also kind of these meta references and they were all over the place and it just worked really well.

449
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:42,174
Rym: and the kind of budding pseudo romance between Saki and Akira who's the?

450
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:46,010
Rym: you know, the man the naked guy who on nakeds was just really charming.

451
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:55,322
Rym: There's a lot of charm in the first episode and there was charm in the second episode and the charm kind of Went away and got replaced by a solid B anime.

452
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:58,923
Rym: Yeah, if it had kept the charm up It would have been a B plus a minus.

453
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:06,470
Scott: Yes The problem was is how do you keep up the charm while also making progress on this dark intriguing?

454
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:08,530
Scott: You know sci-fi plot, right?

455
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,144
Scott: It's like they when they started to investigate like the parts with the doctor.

456
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:13,550
Scott: That was pretty awesome.

457
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:21,423
Scott: But then when they got further into the parts with the Johnny thief and the hacking fat guy You know, I guess the hacking fat guy had a little bit of charm.

458
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:23,972
Rym: So there's a guy in the show Itazu.

459
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,936
Rym: they call him pants cuz.

460
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:26,684
Rym: the kanji of his name could also be right everywhere.

461
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:27,488
Scott: He never wears pants.

462
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:27,990
Scott: He's Rym.

463
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:39,060
Rym: Well, he used to wear pants and he became a hikikomori because one day he was sitting, you know He just graduated he wasn't doing so well in life and his pants were hanging up to dry and they blew away And he never left the house again.

464
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,247
Scott: You only had one pair of pants.

465
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:40,629
Scott: That was it.

466
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:53,410
Rym: He didn't have any others but to his credit He's the hikikomori scary dude, and when you finally meet him in the show and they show him to you He's fat and disgusting But at the same time he is a legitimate awesome smart hacker.

467
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:54,190
Scott: He's not you know.

468
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:07,198
Scott: I think it's actually a pretty good portrayal of a hikikomori right because a lot of the portrayals You see like in welcome to NHK or whatever are Perhaps too realistic Scary people you'd never want to be around.

469
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,930
Scott: but this guy it's like he's actually not a bad guy.

470
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,830
Scott: He's not really bad or evil or freaky or disgusting.

471
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:17,146
Scott: He's just a guy who doesn't go outside, but is otherwise.

472
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:17,990
Scott: he's a smart hacker.

473
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:24,160
Scott: He's fat just because he doesn't go anywhere not because you know, and it's like, you know It's like I at first like I didn't want.

474
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,030
Scott: you know, I'm not gonna like hikikomori character.

475
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,378
Scott: I can be like all day get him away.

476
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:30,360
Scott: But you know, I kind of was like hey I could do it This guy is alright.

477
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:31,189
Scott: I'm with this guy.

478
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:37,146
Scott: But yeah, at least that part of the show though, even though the character was alright, it was dragon.

479
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,250
Rym: because it got a little too.

480
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:44,816
Rym: Death node II almost like it started getting into all the procedural Bs of the mystery.

481
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:48,350
Rym: Yeah and look at something that ghost in the shell standalone complex first gig.

482
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:51,921
Rym: The main mystery was hardly addressed in most of the episodes.

483
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:53,525
Rym: There was individually awesome.

484
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:57,836
Rym: Yes, they stood alone From the complex episodes.

485
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,790
Scott: Well, I mean with only 11 episodes you've kind of got to use every episode.

486
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:02,332
Scott: But

487
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:19,470
Rym: at the same time unlike Death Note while it's doing this procedural stuff The Akira is kind of hiding a lot of information from probably the only person in the world He can actually trust to help him out Which doesn't really make a lot of sense both for his character and for the charm of the first episode.

488
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:21,335
Scott: Yeah, also they they don't.

489
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:26,150
Scott: it's like they give the viewer a lot of information, but they don't give you all the details.

490
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:30,185
Scott: So even after the whole show is over you still have like all these question marks.

491
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:38,450
Rym: that is just like, all right Worse they give all this information to you and to him but not to sake who is arguably the main character.

492
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:47,348
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of it's like even though she is technically the main character like she's actually getting less screen time as the sucks because I wanted her to be more.

493
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:50,724
Rym: the Interaction between her and Akira was like the best part of the show.

494
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,010
Scott: That's what the show is supposed to be about.

495
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,376
Scott: That was what the first episode was.

496
00:31:53,396 --> 00:31:53,597
Rym: Yep.

497
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:56,430
Rym: And then the second best part of the show was him fucks in with the phone.

498
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,193
Rym: Yeah, okay.

499
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,699
Scott: So here how about this?

500
00:31:58,779 --> 00:31:58,960
Scott: right?

501
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,450
Scott: so they bring in when they go back to Japan, right?

502
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,662
Scott: There's all those like sake's friends like the club.

503
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:04,124
Scott: She's in.

504
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,693
Rym: I hate all of them Why don't know.

505
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:07,322
Scott: but like what is their club that they're?

506
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:08,570
Scott: what is their club trying to do?

507
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,896
Scott: Aren't they like they have a goal?

508
00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:11,142
Rym: or they were trying to form a company?

509
00:32:11,203 --> 00:32:12,590
Rym: remember and then it didn't do so.

510
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,359
Rym: Well, and then but it's John I love this character.

511
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,927
Rym: She's like a cute nerdy cute girl.

512
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:18,850
Rym: Who's also a hacker?

513
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,175
Scott: What about the guy who lives in the desk?

514
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:22,222
Rym: Oh, yeah that guy never mind.

515
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:24,170
Rym: cuz we just watched Sanjuro not that long ago.

516
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:25,980
Rym: He reminded me the guy who hid in the closet.

517
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:27,810
Rym: Yeah, who would open the door and say something.

518
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,596
Rym: They're like good point.

519
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:30,067
Rym: and then he's like back into the closet.

520
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:35,710
Scott: I go But the thing is is that it's like where that came out of nowhere.

521
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:39,230
Scott: It's like suddenly she's at this club and they were doing something and there was no explanation.

522
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:44,690
Scott: Like we I'm in a club and we were you know, it would have been fine except that then that club.

523
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,557
Rym: So I was confused way too much.

524
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:48,886
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't confused for like 10 minutes of like.

525
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:49,850
Scott: who are these people?

526
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,913
Scott: What are they doing?

527
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:52,401
Scott: What relation do they have to the characters?

528
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,109
Scott: already know they just didn't explain it all.

529
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:02,623
Scott: They just went right into it and it took me like at least an episode and a half to figure out like what the fuck These people about it was almost going in an interesting.

530
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:10,810
Rym: so important because you know Saki has this adventure with this mysterious guy and they have this kind of really interesting and charming interaction.

531
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,170
Rym: And then the show's following that and it's good.

532
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:29,550
Rym: And then it has a kind of Frodo situation where she's had this experience and she can't go back to normal life and they dwell on that for a little while and Then it just kind of drops that thread when actually that was that thread would have kept the show better than the phone thread.

533
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,796
Scott: Well, the thing is right.

534
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,890
Scott: if you that's a good thread, you know can't go back to the normal life.

535
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:38,569
Scott: But if you look at Frodo, right, they save that thread for the end.

536
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:48,453
Rym: While they save that thread for the end Frodo doesn't go back to Hobbiton halfway through the books and just like putts around for a couple of chapters Exactly.

537
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:49,901
Scott: He goes back to Hobbiton at the end.

538
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:51,710
Rym: Saki goes back to her normal life.

539
00:33:51,971 --> 00:34:00,301
Rym: She has her Frodo moment for like two episodes and then just goes back to the club and the club's really important because they made Google goggles, why is that Google goggles thing even there?

540
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,890
Scott: That is that's like what their company was trying to make, right?

541
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,844
Scott: They were trying to make Google goggles and sell it.

542
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:11,330
Rym: That was their product Yeah, but the fact that that mattered so much just did not jive with what I liked about the show.

543
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,842
Scott: Yeah, it's like what this case this thing came out of nowhere.

544
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,735
Scott: these characters came out of nowhere And you know, it's like.

545
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:19,748
Scott: I don't think he planned out the whole thing before he started.

546
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,650
Rym: Of course the tertiary con didn't plan out paranoia agent.

547
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:24,217
Scott: So yeah, but I mean he didn't plan the end.

548
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:25,201
Scott: this guy didn't play the middle.

549
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,070
Rym: and really what is it with the word Johnny?

550
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:28,429
Rym: Why did they use the word Johnny?

551
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:33,870
Rym: They don't know any other words so much to refer to both penises and skeleton otaku aliens?

552
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:34,592
Scott: I don't know.

553
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:35,315
Rym: remember.

554
00:34:35,335 --> 00:34:38,550
Rym: the skeleton otaku alien shoves his head like up the guy's shirt.

555
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:41,650
Rym: Yeah, I promise the show is not as weird as I'm making it out to be.

556
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,590
Scott: I would say some things about the ending of the show, but I know you didn't let watch the last two episodes yet.

557
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:46,735
Rym: Yep, we don't want to spoil it.

558
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:49,110
Rym: We'll eventually review the movies that people say they're terrible.

559
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:53,810
Rym: I don't know, but once I finish the show we'll do a spoiler episode.

560
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:57,398
Scott: The end of the show the last two episodes.

561
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,828
Scott: they answer one of these questions right that you have but it's not.

562
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,350
Scott: it's like.

563
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:06,730
Scott: You know, sometimes there'll be things that are unexplained and there'll be things that are you know mysteries, right?

564
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,957
Scott: and you actively want to know them and They don't answer all of them.

565
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:13,910
Scott: And in fact, they answer one that was a mystery.

566
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,710
Scott: It was an unknown but you weren't even asking it or thinking about it, but they answer it and that's the big reveal.

567
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:23,704
Scott: It's like oh, come on Why did you give me something I cared about like who is the supporter?

568
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:24,326
Scott: or something like?

569
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:25,009
Rym: they tell you who?

570
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:27,877
Rym: mr Altas I'd always it's guys.

571
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:28,419
Scott: it though.

572
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:29,903
Scott: It was that's a question that you're asking.

573
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:32,070
Scott: So then it's not something to answer.

574
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:37,553
Rym: It's something you're actively questioning to sake and Akira Get together.

575
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:42,830
Scott: if it's something that you're actively questioning like I really want to know this then they don't answer.

576
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:48,410
Rym: But if it's something they're gonna be like the cell phones were powered by nuclear power, you know, the battery was infinite.

577
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:48,952
Scott: You know how.

578
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:53,227
Scott: there's things you know, you don't know and there's things you don't know.

579
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:53,870
Scott: you don't know.

580
00:35:54,492 --> 00:35:55,698
Scott: It's one of the things you don't know.

581
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:56,381
Scott: you don't know.

582
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:58,953
Scott: not one of the things you know, you don't know Huh?

583
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:00,744
Rym: Like why do you get rid of his memory?

584
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,629
Rym: or how or what the fuck?

585
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,456
Scott: Here's the priority you can't.

586
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:04,762
Scott: it's something you think it up.

587
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:10,609
Rym: So it's always gonna be this one thing funny I mean you kind of find out that he erased his own memory like they get to that pretty quick.

588
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:17,150
Rym: and then the question that two episodes before the end has not been answered yet is What was his plan?

589
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:27,186
Rym: He erased his own memory and left himself on purpose naked with a gun and a cell phone in front of the White House And somehow that was supposed to further his plan.

590
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:30,789
Rym: Yeah Does that get answered?

591
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,275
Scott: Maybe he's just being selfish.

592
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:36,384
Scott: I wanted to get away from whatever horrible things.

593
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:37,970
Rym: He knew his dog is really cute.

594
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,209
Scott: It's actually a Galaxy Express episode about that.

595
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:49,239
Scott: You know where there was a. I mean a Galaxy Express a Galaxy Railways or episode where they go to this planet where there's a Some kind of elf creature that steals memories.

596
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:52,130
Scott: So it's like this is lady who's like, oh, please steal my memories.

597
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,838
Scott: They're so horrible and the other people like.

598
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,330
Scott: I don't want you to lose any memories no matter how horrible they are.

599
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,555
Scott: They're mine, you know.

600
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:00,749
Rym: and that kind of message, you know, there's an a on flux episode about that, too.

601
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:02,880
Rym: Ah, it's actually a really good episode.

602
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:03,504
Rym: Very interesting.

603
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:03,845
Scott: Yeah.

604
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:04,589
Scott: All right.

605
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:13,981
Rym: So all in all the show is like a solid B show Like I'm enjoying it about as much as I enjoyed like scrap princess Let's say standard B to watch.

606
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:14,966
Scott: why not go for it?

607
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:16,633
Rym: pros I mean the show.

608
00:37:16,713 --> 00:37:18,620
Rym: the characters are really cute and really good.

609
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,550
Rym: The first two episodes are just incredibly charming.

610
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:32,786
Rym: Just don't be disappointed too much when that awesome like charming interaction with the characters the cute dog with the wings Just kind of takes the back burner to this club and Osugi and all these other characters.

611
00:37:32,806 --> 00:37:37,890
Rym: You really don't care about Mm-hmm, and then the plot gets kind of Death Note II but not in a good way.

612
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:41,260
Rym: He doesn't just call chewy stuff like.

613
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:47,280
Rym: he does things that spend his money to solve problems When there were probably much better ways to go about that.

614
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:53,570
Rym: Yeah, he makes a lot of really dumb mistakes Yeah, and the show kind of protects him from that.

615
00:37:53,610 --> 00:38:00,010
Scott: I would have almost rather seen a show where it was like what would happen if you got me like got the telephone.

616
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:03,580
Scott: I just do the same exact thing.

Scott: Oh my god.

618
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:07,070

Rym: Mm-hmm in the beginner, you know in the opener.
