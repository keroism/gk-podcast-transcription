1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,517
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 23rd, 2010.

2
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:21,217
Rym: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight Pac-man Let's do this.

3
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:33,238
Rym: So Scott pop quiz was Davy Crockett a real person or not.

4
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:41,987
Rym: I'm Leaning towards not because we just had a discussion about this and I feel the need to bring this up live Because he is in fact a real person.

5
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,531
Scott: So Davy Crockett was real.

6
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:43,872
Scott: Yes.

7
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:44,675
Scott: When was he real?

8
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:44,735
Scott: 18?

9
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:45,276
Scott: What 17 what?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,726
Rym: Well through 18 what he lived a while.

11
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:51,756
Scott: Okay, so he was not there for say the Civil War.

12
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:52,900
Rym: Oh, he was there for the Alamo.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,834
Scott: Oh, but I thought that that was just like, you know, the album.

14
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:59,869
Scott: I know the Alamo is definitely Was definitely real.

15
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:01,179
Rym: Yeah, Pee-wee's bike was down there.

16
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:08,650
Scott: I know the Alamo is real, but I did not think that there was a. you know The the Davy Crockett part of the tale was real.

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,140
Rym: Yeah, there was Davy Crockett king of the wild frontier.

18
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:14,178
Scott: What was he actually like as opposed to?

19
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:16,407
Scott: What he was like?

20
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,740
Rym: in the fables there's a whole Wikipedia page about him.

21
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:20,383
Rym: You can read it.

22
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:24,236
Scott: Was he actually awesome or was he just you know fabled like it was?

23
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:25,380
Scott: he's someone who was talked up.

24
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:31,279
Scott: He seems fairly awesome to be honest But how much of that is like fake history?

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,924
Scott: I want to read.

26
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:35,979
Scott: I want to read like the Howard Zinn history of Davy Crockett.

27
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:50,203
Rym: It's just because a minute before the show I was like blah blah blah Davy Crockett because we were looking for examples of like Politicians from the boonies and Scott's like, yeah, Davy Crockett wasn't real I'm pretty sure.

28
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:51,729
Scott: I'm still not quite sure.

29
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,395
Rym: is real, you know, you have a computer.

30
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:54,680
Rym: you could just look up on Wikipedia.

31
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,412
Rym: I couldn't have made an article this elaborate that quickly.

32
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:58,577
Scott: someone else did.

33
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:01,799
Scott: I mean There's gonna be a page about him whether he's real or not, right?

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,188
Scott: Yeah, but I bet there's a page on ball Bunyan.

35
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,620
Rym: Yeah, it probably says Paul Bunyan mythological, dude.

36
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:10,679
Scott: But Paul Bunyan was real.

37
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,820
Scott: Oh He's the blue cow was so the other weekend.

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,197
Rym: Well, Robert Coo was in the city and he had a little meetup gathering that we went to and it was pretty goddamn awesome.

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,172
Rym: I Will note for the listeners here that I removed a good 15 seconds of gum smack.

40
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:27,938
Scott: So Rym you owe me like 25 cents.

41
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:29,664
Rym: Yeah captain.

42
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,877
Rym: I'm gonna chew gum right before we record an audio show.

43
00:02:32,897 --> 00:02:36,808
Scott: Hey Needed to chew some good Tastes good.

44
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,600
Scott: But anyway fake watermelon flavor.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:52,909
Rym: It was fun primarily because it was the first time I think in my entire life where I've spoken to Robert Coo in any Capacity other than in regards to like a specific issue at PAX Professional work like we got to deal with this thing.

46
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,214
Scott: thing is normal guy.

47
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:55,640
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

48
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,276
Rym: Scott has a reputation for being a hater.

49
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:02,600
Scott: now Yeah, everyone say whenever I meet anyone they always seem to think either I hate them or I hate everything.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,490
Rym: Do you ever wonder that maybe that is a defect of the womb?

51
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,253
Scott: I don't know.

52
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,340
Scott: Do you think I hate everyone?

53
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:10,148
Scott: Everything.

54
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,219
Rym: Well, you're a hater now.

55
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,148
Rym: Okay, but the important part is the coup.

56
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:18,080
Rym: man had a bag full of this game called banana grand.

57
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:21,754
Scott: Yeah, the game itself comes in a bag, but then he had a banana.

58
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:25,940
Scott: He had a bag of bananas So he basically had like a whole bunch of copies of this game.

59
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,620
Rym: He had a bag of bags of what are scrabble tiles and it's funny.

60
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,780
Rym: We just did a stupid episode on word games boggle boggle and we didn't know about banana grams.

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,700
Scott: If only we had known it would have been the perfect addition to that episode.

62
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:45,977
Rym: Suffice it to say banana grams is basically real-time directly competitive Scrabble, but everyone has their own board and you're just fucking going for it.

63
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:46,580
Scott: It's awesome.

64
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:47,724
Scott: I just played.

65
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:50,133
Scott: I just played my co-worker and I just I crushed him.

66
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:52,060
Scott: I was like peel peel peel peel peel.

67
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,120
Rym: Yeah, there's a nice intern.

68
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,747
Rym: It's one of those games where it has its own terminology and you kind of get used to it Like I'm gonna peel.

69
00:03:57,868 --> 00:03:59,235
Rym: Oh, no, I'm a rotten banana.

70
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:00,040
Scott: Yeah, there's a bunch.

71
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:02,840
Scott: It's all banana language and it actually works out, right?

72
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,342
Scott: It's like you.

73
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:12,400
Scott: you peel to you know, and there's a bunch and you when you win you say bananas and If you lose if you cheat and you have a word that's not a word rotten banana.

74
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,290
Rym: Now the rules are not necessarily perfect.

75
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,100
Rym: So I feel like after right, I think the rules are definitely perfect.

76
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,325
Rym: They're not perfect in one regard.

77
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:23,000
Rym: They do not explicitly state that you should agree to a dictionary ahead of time.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,672
Scott: It says it says use any available dictionary.

79
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:26,013
Rym: All right.

80
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,399
Rym: I have a French dictionary with me.

81
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:29,369
Rym: All right, so I can use French words.

82
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:34,508
Scott: now the nice life they're in there In an available dictionary, yes, I have.

83
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:37,800
Rym: in fact, I have a dictionary of some functions that I wrote in Java.

84
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:39,829
Rym: I have urban dictionary.

85
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,095
Rym: I have the OED.

86
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,200
Rym: I have dictionary.

87
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:42,924
Rym: I just wrote.

88
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:43,929
Scott: I think it's.

89
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,915
Scott: it doesn't say use it.

90
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,105
Scott: I think the language.

91
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:52,588
Scott: use any available dictionary means that you pick one dictionary But it does not say so by suggest.

92
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:55,580
Scott: that implies that you use one dictionary that is available.

93
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,935
Scott: So whichever one it is that you pick is the only one.

94
00:04:58,035 --> 00:04:58,800
Rym: I pick one.

95
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,907
Rym: Someone else picks another one.

96
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:02,000
Scott: now, I know everyone has to use the one.

97
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,264
Rym: That's what I was saying.

98
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:03,585
Rym: that what?

99
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:10,553
Rym: if you want to play this game and your friends are assholes aka they're like us you have to agree to a dictionary ahead of time.

100
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:16,716
Rym: you get everyone to say okay and Don't even try to challenge words mid game.

101
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:17,520
Rym: It just doesn't work.

102
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,429
Scott: just while the rules say that you shouldn't they?

103
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,478
Scott: basically the way it works is you don't?

104
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,500
Scott: you know, You can play the whole game and it doesn't matter.

105
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:34,460
Scott: You know You don't check anyone's words during the game and at the end of the game when someone says they've won You stop and you see if they've actually won and if they haven't they get the ultimate penalty.

106
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,568
Rym: So it's a penalty for not having a like.

107
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:42,235
Rym: a full set of actual words at the end of the game is basically You lose and you're done and you have no chance of winning.

108
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:49,017
Scott: You're the rotten banana Yeah And so it's like instead of slightly punishing you along the way for putting out a bad word like Scrabble?

109
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,876
Scott: does they just give you The ultimate punishment for having any words at all that are wrong at the very end?

110
00:05:53,916 --> 00:06:03,451
Scott: and that is you lose Which is fairly elegant because otherwise if there were a challenge It would slow down the whole game and you had in the middle of the game You'd have time to sit there and think which would be unfair.

111
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:05,420
Scott: In fact, I would start where speed matters.

112
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:07,515
Rym: I would start challenging people just to get the time.

113
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,180
Rym: if I needed it.

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Rym: Like I got a new cue and I got to do something with it.

115
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,409
Rym: I just feel like I challenge everyone's goddamn words.

116
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:18,470
Scott: I think though it would be pretty cool to play the game Digitally, right and you know, you could.

117
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,260
Scott: there's two different ways to make it happen digitally.

118
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:28,620
Scott: Obviously you could just play it, you know straight up with like iPads or on computers And then it would just put big red blocks around any words that were invalid, you know.

119
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,820
Scott: So you would know in real time if your words are wrong and no one would ever get anything wrong.

120
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,320
Rym: As a side this would be a good candidate for a game to get ported to Xbox Live.

121
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:36,740
Scott: Well, here's right.

122
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:49,734
Scott: What I think they really want to do is take like the Kinect or something or the Sony eye camera Right and have it look at a table full of tiles Right and then it would look at the words and it could.

123
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:56,220
Scott: basically if you had some sort of light Mechanism it could shine lights on so you could still play with the tiles on a table off camera.

124
00:06:56,361 --> 00:07:00,640
Rym: I have all the tiles I need to make any word I want and I just swap them in the whole game and cheat.

125
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:03,814
Scott: I see you're cheating by having a second set of banana grams tiles.

126
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:05,240
Rym: You really think that wouldn't happen.

127
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:10,850
Scott: All right, but that's just that's at least.

128
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:13,380
Scott: that's not a flaw in the game though, that's you cheating.

129
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:21,430
Rym: Yeah, at the same time though, if you're gonna play a game online where the rules are only enforced by not saying online I'm saying just as an aid to play in person.

130
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:22,194
Scott: Oh, that'd be cool.

131
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,320
Scott: You know, that'd be cool.

132
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:29,020
Rym: Anyway, banana grams is not only awesome, but it's going to be like the hot sensation at PAX East.

133
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:31,291
Scott: It's definitely coming up big mark my words.

134
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:33,000
Rym: A lot of people are gonna be playing this game.

135
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,186
Scott: I think it's just gonna.

136
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:39,000
Scott: it's gonna be like the next apples to apples, right right now You can get apples to apples in like the Duane Reade.

137
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:45,629
Scott: You're gonna see banana banana grams in the Duane Reade right next to the Scrabble and monopoly Within you know six months or so.

138
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,540
Rym: a word of warning because ku told us like what this game was all about.

139
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,403
Rym: So we looked online.

140
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:53,257
Rym: they make all these other games like apple grams and such and you know what.

141
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:54,000
Scott: ignore that shit.

142
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,365
Rym: They all suck.

143
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:57,132
Scott: only banana grams that get the banana.

144
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:58,959
Scott: ignore all other fruits except apples.

145
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,359
Scott: to apples Which is I don't think it's the same company.

146
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,003
Rym: There's no way.

147
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:03,767
Scott: but it is weird.

148
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:06,157
Scott: There are a lot of fruit themed games.

149
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:06,920
Scott: I think we should wait.

150
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:08,365
Rym: How is that weird?

151
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:09,007
Rym: Why is fruit?

152
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:19,836
Scott: I mean eventually you have run Renaissance Europe war or Fantasyland with dragons and can I get trains trains trains and fruit fruit?

153
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:21,502
Rym: Yeah, it's fine I think.

154
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:28,552
Rym: the next stop I note there is precedent because as you may recall Arms you may recall and I mock hair or D mock governments.

155
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:31,120
Rym: You can bet on the square tomatoes.

156
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:33,967
Scott: We need the the vegetable game.

157
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:36,696
Rym: Oh, there was that game for the NES.

158
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:37,498
Rym: Oh my god.

159
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:38,260
Rym: What was it called?

160
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:42,597
Rym: You were basically a cucumber and it was like shadow gate and you went around.

161
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,573
Rym: you met Percy the parched persimmon and it was like a man.

162
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:46,774
Scott: Yes.

163
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:50,044
Rym: It was like a puzzle-solving Crazy ass game.

164
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:52,632
Scott: It was princess tomato that maybe that was it.

165
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:54,096
Scott: That was a side-scrolling.

166
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,945
Rym: now, then this is a different game I'm pretty sure.

167
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,699
Rym: I gotta I gotta figure out what this game was.

168
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:07,713
Scott: So, yeah banana grams, all right, so gaming news Gaming news is getting kind of light because they were talking about.

169
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,480
Rym: there's tons of stuff to talk about.

170
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:12,320
Scott: Oh, it seems like there was a bunch of holiday release action.

171
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,900
Scott: And now it's just like alright everyone go spend your goddamn money, right?

172
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:19,032
Scott: And there's no real action gonna happen until after the holidays.

173
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:20,720
Scott: and there's new releases again, you know.

174
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:27,563
Scott: because if you were gonna release a holiday game, it better be out now because Black Friday is Three days.

175
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:29,552
Scott: So all the holiday games are out.

176
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:31,440
Scott: today was Tuesday the game release day.

177
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,759
Scott: So instead of talking about game release I could talk about something else that happens every year, right?

178
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:47,527
Scott: Maybe we'll move it to the meta moment for the the remainder of the year, but the child's play has Rebegun, ah child's play.

179
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:49,252
Rym: I gotta go send some DS's or something.

180
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:52,641
Scott: Empty your wallets for the children's Empty?

181
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:53,123
Rym: You know what?

182
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:53,765
Scott: You know what?

183
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:54,708
Rym: Banana grams.

184
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:56,274
Scott: Oh my god.

185
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:58,040
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna send two copies of banana.

186
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,310
Scott: I'm gonna send a banana grams to every hospital and all the child's play Every hospital, that's not that much money.

187
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,140
Rym: Yeah, I don't know how many hospitals they have now.

188
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:05,986
Scott: Oh, that's true.

189
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:06,992
Scott: They might have had a ton.

190
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,060
Scott: I might not be able to afford it.

191
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,993
Scott: So everybody send one banana grams to the children's hospital.

192
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:13,057
Rym: Let's make this a thing.

193
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:15,799
Rym: Let me hear you Let's make banana grams the gift.

194
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:19,355
Scott: The thing is the other bet the bad games apple grams.

195
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:24,060
Scott: and when you know all those Yeah, they are better for they're better for the children's even though you might not like them, right?

196
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,908
Rym: So also, you know sentiment sentiment apples to apples.

197
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,273
Scott: then all the children's will play together.

198
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:31,244
Rym: banana grams better for the smarter children's Definitely.

199
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,390
Scott: There's some other good game.

200
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:33,738
Scott: You could send a settlers to the hospital.

201
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:34,040
Scott: Why not?

202
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,340
Scott: I'm sure there's like a some teenage kid there who's like, oh man settlers in the hospital.

203
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,289
Rym: That's about you realize that the blows mine the president here.

204
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,640
Rym: Is that some sad kid is gonna get Twilight struggle?

205
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:47,130
Scott: Don't send Twilight struggle to the hospital.

206
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:49,160
Scott: They actually have Amazon wish list.

207
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,839
Scott: You just pick it off the list and you know, so there you go.

208
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:56,700
Rym: So in non child helping news, in fact, perhaps the opposite of this child killing news.

209
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,875
Rym: We haven't talked much about the fact that farm Ville is getting a city Ville.

210
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:06,348
Scott: that is basically fake Sim City But there's already like 20 farm Ville's right?

211
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:09,659
Scott: There's like there's a there's the farm and there's a city.

212
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,265
Scott: Yeah, a frontier.

213
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:12,751
Rym: this stuff is getting off the home.

214
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:15,140
Scott: There's a fantasy, you know, they got every theme.

215
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,862
Scott: They got it covered.

216
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:27,136
Rym: what I do want to talk about because I realized something recently that scares me is the civilization network Which is basically Civ 5 came out and is very popular even though multiplayer is broken and I hate you guys.

217
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:36,280
Rym: on that aside Sit the civilization network is basically let's take Civ 5 and mash it up with farm Ville and Facebook and make it shitty.

218
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:37,504
Scott: It's gonna be terrible.

219
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:40,435
Scott: They're basically slapping a Civ theme on a crappy.

220
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:42,347
Scott: You remember that there was that game We played.

221
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:43,600
Scott: what was that one?

222
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,203
Scott: It was like all.

223
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:51,040
Scott: you had a city and they're all the different buildings in it and all you did was wait until you you For the time to elapse and then you upgraded a building Tim Tower.

224
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:55,080
Scott: No, remember everyone was playing it for like a day or two and they were like, oh fuck this.

225
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,552
Rym: There was that one where we made Greek city-states.

226
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:58,356
Scott: Yeah, that was that.

227
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,060
Rym: Yeah, that was the one.

228
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:00,785
Scott: Yeah, that's basically what this is gonna be.

229
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:02,089
Rym: what amazes me though.

230
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,093
Rym: And here's the scary part.

231
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:05,280
Rym: So it's a Facebook whatever game.

232
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:11,934
Rym: apparently The guy who designed Civ 2 and Alpha Centauri Brian Reynolds.

233
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:13,379
Rym: He works for Zynga.

234
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,105
Scott: now Mmm, how about that?

235
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:26,218
Rym: and my worry is that it's weird because I don't consider social Well what we call social games to be in any way like in competition with actual games like they're.

236
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:29,000
Rym: they're not even gay They're a different class of entertainment.

237
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:34,140
Rym: I don't know what to call it yet, but it kind of bothers me that that's what we're calling social games.

238
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,920
Rym: I mean to me a social game is like mafia.

239
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:43,400
Scott: Yeah, or any Mario game on any game that is multiplayer is thereby social?

240
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:47,060
Rym: I would argue not multiplayer games that don't involve player interaction.

241
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:50,900
Rym: They can be social but the social is not an obligatory component of them.

242
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:52,588
Scott: Here's the thing right is it's tough?

243
00:12:52,628 --> 00:13:08,260
Scott: because you think about something like a race Right, and it's like there's some races where it's just go as fast as you can But then you look at something like roll to the ages which appears to have no interaction But you can roll the pestilence and poison everybody, right?

244
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:16,373
Scott: So there is a little bit, you know or like, you know NASCAR you think everyone's just racing But or f1 everyone's just racing, but you can crash into somebody.

245
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:17,998
Rym: So what worries me here?

246
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:18,440
Rym: the reasons.

247
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:20,816
Rym: I mean, we don't have any details about this game yet.

248
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,786
Rym: So Theoretically, it could be awesome.

249
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,134
Rym: It could just be like it's not it's not gonna be.

250
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:29,967
Scott: it's gonna be less complicated And less good than Civ Rev there.

251
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:30,829
Scott: So that's guaranteed.

252
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,394
Rym: Well Civ Rev was basically.

253
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:34,260
Rym: baby wants to play Civ the game.

254
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:37,231
Scott: Yes, this is gonna be less than that, which means it's gonna be.

255
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:39,359
Scott: but you know, really small baby wants to play Civ.

256
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,100
Rym: There was a non-zero chance that maybe this was going to be a good game in some way.

257
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Rym: maybe they're going to take advantage of the social nature of Facebook to make like 40 person like everyone's got a civilization awesome.

258
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:55,410
Rym: Here are the statements that make me believe that is the opposite of the truth.

259
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:55,711
Rym: one.

260
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:58,460
Rym: It is quote a fully persistent environment.

261
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:01,127
Scott: They turn down down.

262
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,320
Rym: So that means that there's no way it's actually a competitive game.

263
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,250
Rym: Yeah, because then you know, I started first.

264
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:10,450
Rym: my Civ has nukes you have sticks Yep, and two free to play.

265
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,180
Rym: Yep free to play is what DDO did.

266
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,971
Rym: It's what every like Korean model MMO is doing.

267
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:17,296
Scott: my only hope right.

268
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:18,200
Scott: and also a Facebook.

269
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:22,760
Scott: I think this is also the hope of say, you know, the the people working on it, right?

270
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,688
Scott: Is that you know if they can?

271
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:27,220
Scott: right now, let's say you're a Farmville person, right?

272
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,780
Scott: So they get all these people to play Farmville and some people just farm it up a little bit.

273
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,345
Scott: But some people they farm it up a lot.

274
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:36,560
Scott: right if there was a Farmville that was actually hardcore, right?

275
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:42,952
Rym: If it wasn't necessarily good by our standards But if it were not this you're not graduating from Farmville to anything.

276
00:14:42,993 --> 00:14:46,940
Scott: you graduate from Farmville to more Farmville Mate, they're all eventually to death.

277
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:58,540
Scott: I. the fact that this game is free tells me that they're hoping that they can get these people who are not Gamers right who have no interest in games to graduate from baby Civ, right?

278
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,580
Scott: I think this is also why they made Civ Rev.

279
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:06,434
Scott: They want people to graduate from that Civ up to the bigger Civ and Because it's.

280
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:14,487
Scott: you know If it's too difficult to make a game with a with a learning curve where you can start easy and get harder as you go On the game, you know, it's Civ.

281
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:16,256
Scott: it throws a lot at you right from the get-go.

282
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:18,465
Scott: pick a science What are you gonna build in your city?

283
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,348
Scott: Where are you gonna move?

284
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:22,340
Rym: your warrior frames already got spearmen around your city, right?

285
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,825
Scott: You know, it throws a lot of you right from turn one and even though turn one is a lot simpler than later turns It's still a lot.

286
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,820
Scott: if you've never played games before right?

287
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:38,013
Scott: So instead of making Civ scale up from you know, baby Civ up in the same game They're trying to make a separate game and you can graduate up to the big boy game.

288
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:39,900
Scott: now what and that might work.

289
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:48,480
Scott: I think that there are some people who might get hooked on the baby Civ and then they're gonna Advertise the advertised for the real Civ in the baby Civ and people graduate.

290
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,132
Rym: Well, it's tough to say because it really depends on how they design the game.

291
00:15:52,473 --> 00:16:12,591
Rym: the crux of it is whether or not it is Actually a game because if it is not a game at all Then this is kind of a false path where it's going to take people from things that aren't games to something that isn't a game that has the same name as something that is a game and I think that's a Less easy jump to make through the real game versus.

292
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:27,300
Rym: if this is a game even if it's a very easy game If there's actually something going on, that is my obi-wan that this game is not great But it has some sort of decision-making that actually matters and has some way to fail.

293
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:38,086
Scott: I think that what's gonna happen right is Even more likely is people will play the baby Civ and they'll graduate and then they won't like the big boy But they might like Civ revolutions.

294
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,995
Scott: Yeah, but Civ Rev is basically they did sort of dead.

295
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:43,203
Rym: Yeah, but they maybe they'll bring it back I don't think.

296
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:45,837
Rym: maybe they'll put it on Facebook and you have to pay for it.

297
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:46,359
Scott: I don't know.

298
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:47,024
Scott: I don't know.

299
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,071
Scott: I don't know what's gonna have to.

300
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:49,300
Scott: five is gonna be around for a while.

301
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:59,280
Rym: These games usually last a few years Yeah, and they're it's sort of a perpetual seller too Even though I'm basically not playing any more Civ 5 until I have pit boss and can play by mail.

302
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:04,700
Scott: Yeah, that that's they definitely said that's it come in in the next big patch is the the pit boss and all that stuff.

303
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:16,450
Rym: So but anyway things of the day daddy two things of the day.

304
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:20,030
Rym: Well, you can't do that cuz I got to use a normal one and I think this is really cool.

305
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:26,109
Rym: You might have seen it on Kotaku, but it's a cute little song that tells you how to draw Mario and it works.

306
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:29,789
Rym: Okay, I tried to draw Mario and I got almost Mario.

307
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:33,349
Rym: Mmm, interesting, but the song is stuck in my head.

308
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:36,763
Rym: So I figured she'd be stuck in your head too much like GGG.

309
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:40,844
Rym: you get GGG stuck in your head You know, but I got this Mario song stuck in my head.

310
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:41,548
Scott: You watch the GGG.

311
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,270
Rym: I yes once and I've never watched it again.

312
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,274
Scott: Why don't you watch it again?

313
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:48,550
Rym: Cuz I don't want to get it stuck in my head, but the girls are real hot.

314
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:51,262
Rym: I've still got the Tetris song stuck in my head.

315
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:51,866
Rym: I'm good with that.

316
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:53,983
Rym: Okay Every day at work.

317
00:17:54,024 --> 00:18:00,861
Scott: I'm sitting there like Anyway, because that's the rings true.

318
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,530
Rym: So my other thing is the day.

319
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,730
Rym: The reason I give to is that you may not want to click on the second one.

320
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:16,450
Rym: This is disturbing But it's not disturbing because of any graphic ness or sex or like ultra violence or any of the things you'd expect.

321
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,843
Rym: It's disturbing in a Jesus Christ kind of way.

322
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:21,290
Rym: a bunch of people in the forum.

323
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:29,106
Rym: We're talking about flash games and I saw someone say like oh man I played covetous and I was like covetous little flash game.

324
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:29,869
Rym: All right, whatever.

325
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,896
Rym: I'm game I'll play it and I'm about to go to bed.

326
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:32,358
Rym: I sit down.

327
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:33,483
Rym: I played this little flash game.

328
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:37,708
Rym: It's like a minute long Jesus fucking Christ.

329
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:39,952
Scott: It's weird.

330
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,434
Scott: I don't know.

331
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,263
Rym: It's it's just you got to admit it is disturbing.

332
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:45,650
Rym: It is not scary, but it is disturbing.

333
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:46,670
Scott: I wasn't really disturbed.

334
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,590
Scott: I was just like a weird internet game and it has this interest.

335
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,810
Rym: It's an idea where you have a game where ostensibly your utility is to win the game.

336
00:18:54,192 --> 00:19:07,473
Rym: So the game presents you with this very simple challenge You can't lose at this game and yet going through the challenge will make something horrible happen But yet you're obligated to go through it as the player which makes an almost more visceral Response.

337
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:10,050
Rym: that had a similar thing been made as an animation or a movie.

338
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:11,517
Rym: It is.

339
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:12,530
Rym: it's much like passage.

340
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,143
Rym: It's proof that games are art on a fundamental level.

341
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:21,899
Rym: for anyone who's stupid enough not to believe that You've been too much high praise in this little crappy flesh And also our friend Conrad.

342
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:22,681
Rym: he was working late.

343
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:25,410
Rym: So he was like, what's that creepy flash gave you mentioned?

344
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,233
Rym: I'm like covetous.

345
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:27,257
Rym: and two minutes later.

346
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:30,269
Rym: He messaged me with the exact words Jesus fucking Christ.

347
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,942
Scott: Okay So anyway, you know holidays are coming right.

348
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:38,247
Scott: black Friday is Friday.

349
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:45,090
Scott: this Friday So I I was thinking hey, we should have a GeekNights' gift guide, but there's a problem with that.

350
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,301
Scott: That would require effort on our part to make a gift guide.

351
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:50,750
Scott: so well, I don't want anything me either.

352
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,532
Rym: I mean things.

353
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:56,709
Rym: I want a Miata a beach house a garage to put it in.

354
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,887
Scott: Otherwise, keep the car, right?

355
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,537
Scott: But apparently right boing-boing.

356
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:07,390
Scott: put up a gift guide and the boing-boing gift guide is 90% identical to the geek.

357
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,590
Scott: That's gift guide or what the GeekNights gift guide would be gig nights gift guide.

358
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:20,305
Scott: It includes such items as an Arduino a big-ass tub of Lego you know a copy of Minecraft who you know?

359
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:28,204
Scott: a Stylophone which is basically a musical Synthesizing device with a little stylus right?

360
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:43,765
Scott: No banana grams banana grams Remote control helicopter, you know, though I get and something I did not know existed that is relevant to this episode Which is pac-man moleskine, there's a special limited edition pac-man moleskine.

361
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:45,490
Rym: are the pages different or just the outside?

362
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,154
Scott: I don't know.

363
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:47,530
Scott: I think just the outside.

364
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,960
Rym: I just put a sticker of pac-man on.

365
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,570
Scott: my moleskine idea comes with some pac-man stickers.

366
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:54,809
Rym: All right, not that bad.

367
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:56,117
Scott: You know it.

368
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:56,560
Scott: look at it.

369
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,198
Scott: It's actually pretty vent, you know It's got a lot of pac-man styling going on.

370
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:03,124
Scott: It's not it's not light on the pac-man.

371
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:04,850
Scott: It's got a lot of fruits man.

372
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:05,547
Scott: What's are the fruits?

373
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:09,516
Scott: Oh Nanograms pac-man fruits.

374
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:17,610
Rym: So before we get into the real stuff, you know, we got the meta moment Which we've forgotten off non lately, you know There's one thing I've always wanted to include in the meta moment that I keep forgetting to include.

375
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,150
Scott: Yeah, that is corrections of things we get wrong.

376
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:23,245
Rym: We never get anything or how we get things wrong.

377
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:23,970
Scott: pretty much all the guys.

378
00:21:24,171 --> 00:21:25,398
Scott: Yeah, we never remember.

379
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:34,570
Scott: I want to from now on if we get something wrong Remind us, you know two weeks afterwards because if it's I get something wrong on a Tuesday I want to correct it the next Tuesday episode.

380
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:37,881
Scott: So remind us of the corrections to put in the meta moment.

381
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:40,310
Scott: if we when if what not when if when?

382
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,774
Scott: We get things wrong.

383
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:45,167
Rym: You might have to remind us repeatedly because we are also very forgetful.

384
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:46,092
Scott: Yeah It's like.

385
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:48,968
Scott: I'll remember I got it wrong, but I'll forget to put it in the meta moment.

386
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,635
Scott: So That's meta.

387
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:51,584
Scott: Number one meta.

388
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:54,674
Scott: number two MAGFest.

00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:55,742
Rym: we're gonna be at mag fest.

Rym: We're part of the mag nine.

391
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:59,690
Rym: We're doing one panel and we're sitting out a bunch of other panels.

392
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:05,088
Rym: The rest of the time you will find me halfway to completely ragingly drunk wandering around.

393
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:09,270
Scott: being awesome You'll find me playing fidget games and board games.

394
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,695
Rym: We'll likely be at anime Boston.

395
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:15,687
Rym: We will definitely be at PAX East doing tours to three panels.

396
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:16,228
Rym: give or take.

397
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:19,436
Scott: we'll say There's a nerd NYC recess.

398
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:22,345
Scott: That's the same weekend as mag fest.

399
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:23,067
Scott: So we're not going to that.

400
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:23,869
Rym: No, we're not going to that.

401
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:31,770
Scott: And Thanksgiving send me your cornucopias and nobody has sent me a cornucopia.

402
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:36,290
Rym: Last but not least the book club look was Max Brooks World War Z. We're done with it.

403
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,434
Rym: We're gonna do the show real soon.

404
00:22:37,474 --> 00:22:39,883
Rym: So if you haven't read it yet, hurry up read.

405
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:40,445
Scott: I got.

406
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:41,650
Scott: I still have to read it.

407
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,376
Scott: What sucks?

408
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:43,890
Scott: I'm still only a third of the way through.

409
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:48,889
Rym: If you haven't read it by now you're not gonna like my review.

410
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:56,830
Scott: You know, how can anyone believe that our review is fair and unbiased?

411
00:22:57,872 --> 00:22:59,847
Rym: This book until I read it?

412
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,596
Scott: Yeah Yeah, anyway Nobody's gonna believe you if you act that way.

413
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:06,559
Rym: act what way?

414
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:12,520
Scott: being honest about what I believe no being all honest It gives it an impression of prejudice.

415
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:14,970
Scott: ask anybody by being completely honest.

416
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,619
Rym: So you're saying I'm not being honest.

417
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:19,666
Rym: I secretly like this god-awful book.

418
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:24,069
Rym: No You're not denying that the book is god-awful.

419
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,413
Scott: I'm not saying either way.

420
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,639
Scott: What I'm saying is that people got off.

421
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,349
Scott: people will believe that you were knocking it before trying But I read it a while ago.

422
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:41,210
Rym: I'm just saying that you it's gonna be difficult to convince people otherwise In fact, so what if I waited until the show and then said the same thing that it was awful?

423
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,893
Scott: He will believe it.

424
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,117
Rym: I don't think so.

425
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:43,680
Scott: I think they would.

426
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:48,387
Rym: I think anyone who likes these zombie books is gonna hate us No matter what after that review and we'll see.

427
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:51,888
Rym: So pac-man.

428
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:55,741
Scott: Oh We had another more meta though, there's too much meta.

429
00:23:55,902 --> 00:24:04,588
Scott: what other meta do we have that Just in time for Black Friday for all your shopping needs despite the lack of a GeekNights' gift guide.

430
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:09,141
Rym: All right The GeekNights store went live as of Sunday and no one noticed.

431
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:12,392
Scott: one person just noticed and they were complaining that we don't ship To Canada.

432
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:13,718
Scott: Can we do we ship to Canada?

433
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:16,168
Rym: I ship to wherever Google will ship if Google won't ship to you.

434
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,424
Scott: I'm sorry No, well, how can we fix that?

435
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:19,029
Scott: We'll look into it.

436
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:19,592
Rym: I don't know.

437
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:21,863
Rym: I set it up to go to anywhere that Google check out.

438
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:22,606
Rym: We'll let it go.

439
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:29,769
Rym: All right Maybe because I only set up USPS as a thing because that would be USPS ships to Canada.

440
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:30,481
Rym: Yes I don't know.

441
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:36,510
Scott: So, yeah, if you want a GeekNights t-shirt we currently only have one t-shirt design.

442
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:37,355
Rym: It's the old one.

443
00:24:37,496 --> 00:24:38,119
Rym: Once we sell out.

444
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:38,924
Rym: We'll have to order more.

445
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:39,950
Scott: We're gonna have to order more.

446
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,977
Scott: Did you actually put in like the inventory in there?

447
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:42,840
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:46,333
Rym: Okay, so it will sell out when it cares about the inside stuff We've got.

449
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:49,048
Scott: I just want to make sure that it'll say sold out when it's sold out.

450
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:51,659
Scott: Yeah taking orders and we don't have anymore.

451
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:52,281
Rym: No, it all works.

452
00:24:52,362 --> 00:24:54,550
Rym: I don't the listeners don't care about all the back-end stuff.

453
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:55,550
Rym: I even put this in the meta.

454
00:24:55,791 --> 00:25:02,850
Scott: I just want to make sure that you know, we don't get like a thousand orders in for sure It's we don't have and then we're gonna get a thousand orders.

455
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,553
Rym: It could happen.

456
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:07,030
Rym: I have a feeling there are about two people are gonna order a t-shirt in the next few weeks.

457
00:25:09,432 --> 00:25:12,781
Rym: You know also I point out you could have just asked me that any time.

458
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:18,844
Scott: I You know for people to see what the you know to make sure that they're not waiting.

459
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:21,842
Scott: if people might you know Think that they're gonna be waiting for a long time.

460
00:25:21,883 --> 00:25:22,869
Scott: if that we don't have enough shirts.

461
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:31,574
Scott: okay, that's For their benefit, you know, so pac-man championship edition DX all pac-mans I want to do.

462
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:42,734
Scott: if we haven't done any show on any pac-mans I want to talk about all pac-mans but the reason that we came up with the idea to talk about pac-mans is because the pac-man championship edition DX which is The awesome.

463
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:46,230
Rym: I don't however want to bother talking about the history of pac-man or anything.

464
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,869
Rym: I just want to talk about pac-man is games.

465
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,513
Scott: Yeah, we don't need.

466
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,090
Scott: you can look at the history of pac-man and only canonical real pac-man games.

467
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,997
Rym: I don't want to talk about pac-man jr.

468
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,844
Scott: But that's a real pac-man game.

469
00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:57,249
Rym: Yeah, it's not a good game.

470
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:58,604
Scott: How about pac-man world - I?

471
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,060
Rym: Never played that pac-man world - it's right over there.

472
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,444
Scott: You have a copy of it on your shelf.

473
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:05,889
Rym: How the fuck did that get there?

474
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:14,494
Rym: Ah There it is, oh my god That is perhaps the worst game I've ever seen.

475
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:15,897
Scott: It's not that fits not.

476
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:17,600
Rym: Custer's revenge is at least a game.

477
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,237
Scott: I know this is worse games.

478
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:21,360
Scott: How is it compared to ET?

479
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:24,370
Rym: You know what ET not that bad.

480
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:26,881
Scott: Oh, I see you come around on that one.

481
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:28,147
Rym: ET is the worst game.

482
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:43,190
Scott: I've beaten Anyway, so pac-man Champion edition DX right is basically the idea here as they wanted to make a pac-man game for the 360 But they wanted it to be like, you know, like big, you know and have championship miss.

483
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:46,930
Scott: And if they just went with regular old pat, you know, they had to come up with some spin on pac-man.

484
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,089
Scott: so the spin they came up with is have a fucking ton of ghosts.

485
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,510
Scott: and The thing with having a ton of ghosts is that the old maps don't work.

486
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,555
Scott: So they came up with all new maps.

487
00:26:54,635 --> 00:26:57,128
Rym: also the old like fundamental game mechanics don't work.

488
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:57,550
Rym: that well.

489
00:26:57,851 --> 00:27:05,764
Scott: No, I mean the original pac-man is mostly once you've figured it out, you know Once you know how to avoid the ghosts and you know how to clear the board.

490
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,090
Scott: It just gets faster.

491
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,619
Scott: So your reflexes need to improve but it was hurt.

492
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,485
Rym: the power pills last less laws.

493
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:12,930
Scott: power pills last less long.

494
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,129
Scott: so you need to be more accurate in getting the ghosts right next to you and you get the power pill.

495
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:19,115
Scott: and Other than that though.

496
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:20,842
Scott: Once you've maxed the game out.

497
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,550
Scott: you've maxed it out, right?

498
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:26,205
Scott: At that point once it's maxed out you just it's just endurance.

499
00:27:26,366 --> 00:27:27,855
Rym: like as a kid in the Atari I'd play mrs.

500
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,368
Rym: Pac-man all the goddamn time.

501
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:31,598
Rym: 7800. so it was a real pac-man.

502
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:33,163
Rym: It wasn't like that abortion.

503
00:27:33,203 --> 00:27:33,605
Rym: That was the.

504
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:34,950
Rym: you know, hundred pac-man.

505
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:45,687
Scott: You know, the first game system ever had was 2,600 and the first video games ever played were 2,600. so I actually Was sadly thought that that 2,600 pac-man was the pac-man.

506
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,355
Rym: God Scott I never knew for

507
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,883
Scott: a long time and really

508
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:49,446
Rym: sad

509
00:27:49,466 --> 00:28:07,006
Scott: when I was three That was like the only game I played and I didn't even I like I had such a poor Understanding when I was that young that like I would just start the game and I would set it on like level 8 because I Was I didn't realize I would just start at level 1. just you know, cuz you could pick any level to start at.

510
00:28:07,328 --> 00:28:22,369
Scott: and I Didn't realize like I didn't fully comprehend much like I didn't fully comprehend drawing in the lines Right that I was supposed to get all the dots Like it wasn't all there in the early days

511
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:32,750
Rym: Even when I was older like when I was eight or nine I would play games not necessarily pac-man but more complex games Where I realized looking back I wasn't good at them because I wasn't actually trying to win.

512
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,949
Rym: I was just kind of like dicking around in these games.

513
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,530
Scott: Yeah, I didn't you know, so this is when I was like three or four, right?

514
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,416
Scott: I was real little.

515
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:42,312
Scott: not fully get in the pac-man But I was playing.

516
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:55,150
Rym: but my trouble with miss pac-man and then pac-man in the arcade and everything was that very rarely Would I die like me and not having the skill to continue going would not stop me.

517
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:59,046
Rym: What would stop me is that it's been 45 goddamn minutes and I'm bored.

518
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:06,370
Scott: Yeah I mean, you know, that's why I prefer games like say Galaga where you go and die It's like you're gonna die.

519
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:26,164
Rym: Actually, I'm not impressed much with the twin galaxies records or any of that sort of stuff and this is why pac-man fundamentally wouldn't have worked as a modern game because Basically the skill cap is actually other than going for endurance and perfection Relatively low and these ultra high scores are just a matter of patience

520
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:27,067
Scott: and practice.

521
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:32,290
Rym: patience in practice But mostly patience and endurance of just being willing to sit there forever.

522
00:29:32,411 --> 00:29:40,990
Scott: I once played Dig Dug for like three hours and then I just got sick of it and turn it on Not like kaboom right where it just gets faster faster faster faster, and you're gonna you're gonna lose at some point.

523
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,270
Rym: Yeah, you're really good max it out and then it does and then you can just like max out the score completely.

524
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,376
Rym: I just never got that good.

525
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:50,070
Scott: Yeah, but I mean look at for the perfect example of endurance, right?

526
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,730
Scott: Look at the guy who was the high score for asteroids.

527
00:29:51,790 --> 00:30:01,610
Scott: he had his own asteroids machine and he videotaped himself which is a legitimate way of getting a twin galaxies score and he basically Played so well that he would get a zillion extra lives and then he would go to the bathroom.

528
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,842
Scott: He'd eat lunch, you know and the game would just sit there.

529
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:08,890
Scott: and in asteroids You don't die that often because the asteroids move kind of slow.

530
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:17,689
Scott: So if you just beat a level and then you sit still in the middle there, you know You might get hit a couple times, but if you just got ten lives You're not gonna lose them all, you know.

531
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:22,110
Scott: And this guy would get enough lives to go off of the board because that's how the scoring mechanism works.

532
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:32,950
Scott: you know you you can get just tons and tons of extra lives and then he would just come back when he was ready and Rack up a zillion more extra lives in a zillion more points and then go about his daily business.

533
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:33,331
Rym: Oh, it's.

534
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,163
Rym: it's basically a fundamental design flaw of any competitive game.

535
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:51,559
Rym: where you can reach a point We're like all players are relatively equal and it comes down to something like endurance or time Especially in video games when there's like there's nothing to differentiate the high-level players quickly Yeah, or like you can have the same problem as pitfall.

536
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,970
Scott: right where basically pitfall you finish it you get all the treasures.

537
00:30:55,471 --> 00:31:01,550
Scott: So people basically end up playing, you know a perfect or near-perfect pitfall and then that's it.

538
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:13,630
Scott: so there's like X number of guys in the world who can pretty much beat pitfall almost or completely perfectly and There's no way to differentiate between them because they all hit max at the game.

539
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,462
Rym: I mean the only way to do it is whoever did it first.

540
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:20,890
Scott: Yes, however Pac-man championship edition DX has solved this problem.

541
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,257
Scott: They've taken the basic mechanics of pac-man.

542
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:26,527
Scott: eat all the dots power pills let you eat ghosts ghosts.

543
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,590
Scott: Try to chase pac-man.

544
00:31:29,732 --> 00:31:30,477
Scott: The bombs are new.

545
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:32,610
Scott: you push a bomb and all the ghosts go back to the middle.

546
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,996
Scott: But you only have a limited number of them.

547
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,030
Rym: I found that I have infinite of them because I get them so frequently.

548
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:45,861
Scott: Yeah, well, it depends like if you're doing a time trial mode, which is the mode I actually like the most You only get so many bombs and you're probably not in the way.

549
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:54,268
Scott: to get more bombs is to eat ghosts that are carrying them right, so You're not likely to eat a lot of ghosts because that takes time away.

550
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:59,846
Rym: Yeah Now I play an expert all the time now, so you only get three bombs on expert.

551
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:12,089
Scott: Yeah Yeah, the way the game works basically is each level each course has sort of a pattern to it You know and some of them the patterns sort of easy and obvious Like in the first course is challenge two.

552
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:17,247
Scott: I don't know why challenge two is the first course and challenge one is harder, but whatever don't you recognize?

553
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:17,910
Rym: challenge one?

554
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,527
Rym: Okay, never mind anyway anyway.

555
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:25,535
Scott: But Challenge two right.

556
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:31,548
Scott: you just basically go to where the fruit is and then follow the dots go to and then a fruit appears And you go for that fruit and you follow the dots and that's the pattern.

557
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:36,527
Scott: But saying challenge one it's much more difficult to follow the plus even the simple pattern.

558
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,210
Rym: This is a brilliance.

559
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:41,870
Rym: All right, you're following the pattern you're doing good you cock up once and suddenly it's gay.

560
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,863
Rym: You're all over the place now running from ghosts hitting bombs.

561
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:46,330
Scott: Yeah, you got to get back in that pattern.

562
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,803
Scott: Also, even when the pattern is obvious, right?

563
00:32:48,823 --> 00:32:49,990
Scott: It's like all follow this pattern.

564
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:52,270
Scott: There's also the mechanic of waking up the ghost, right?

565
00:32:52,370 --> 00:33:00,459
Scott: There's sleeping ghosts around the map and if you go near them They wake up and they start they join this chain gang of ghosts that is chasing you down Which is the crux of the game.

566
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:03,081
Rym: This is a game and the first time I played it I'm like, this is fun.

567
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:03,589
Rym: This is fun.

568
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:08,506
Rym: And then suddenly I was like wait a minute if I get a power pill and then I ate like 200 ghosts.

569
00:33:09,775 --> 00:33:17,789
Scott: I think it actually maxes out because I've reached a point where I had a huge chain of ghosts and I would wake up more ghosts from their sleep And they would just sort of fly off the screen.

570
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:22,510
Scott: I was watching them and I was like, oh they're not even joining the pack because this pack is so big.

571
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:27,950
Rym: Well one it depends on like if you're when you grab fruit and more importantly are you doing the ghost challenge?

572
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:28,963
Rym: You're just in the normal game.

573
00:33:28,983 --> 00:33:29,430
Scott: That's true.

574
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:29,973
Scott: It's like cuz.

575
00:33:29,993 --> 00:33:31,864
Scott: there's different modes, right and there's the.

576
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:34,315
Scott: there's the score mode Which is play for X minutes.

577
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:35,038
Scott: get the highest score.

578
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:42,427
Rym: you can brilliant the fact that it's minutes as opposed to lives Yep, and because that makes this game right you do direct competition course.

579
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,190
Scott: You do have lives.

580
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:46,746
Scott: Yeah, you do but it's much better for come for competitive purposes.

581
00:33:46,787 --> 00:33:50,577
Scott: get the most points You can in five minutes get the most points You can attend men a tournament in.

582
00:33:50,617 --> 00:33:55,630
Rym: this is basically like what the wizard should have been Yep, then this ghost combo mode.

583
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:57,138
Scott: The only thing that matters is how many?

584
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,746
Scott: what's your biggest ghost combo?

585
00:33:59,108 --> 00:33:59,390
Scott: and that's it?

586
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:12,686
Scott: It gives you like ten minutes, but you basically hit select and end as soon as you've gotten your big combo Yep, and then There's time trial mode Which is the mode I like and that is get X fruits as fast as you can.

587
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:13,790
Rym: and there's ten.

588
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:21,030
Rym: It's actually really cool how it does it because you have to do like ten courses of varying difficulty And then your aggregate times are what puts you in the leaderboard?

589
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:24,880
Scott: Yeah And so and the thing is it adds up right your.

590
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:25,724
Scott: all these different.

591
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:27,409
Scott: every course has all these different modes.

592
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:31,830
Scott: Some of the courses of different modes like the half-track course only has time trial modes.

593
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,216
Scott: It doesn't have any score modes.

594
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,197
Rym: My favorite one so far was the dungeon because it changes Constantly, I like the dungeon.

595
00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:39,284
Scott: I like the half-track.

596
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:40,270
Scott: I like the highway.

597
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,722
Scott: I think the highway is the best designed one.

598
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:48,187
Scott: Highway is the most fun because It lets you go off the edge and come around the other side a lot.

599
00:34:48,348 --> 00:34:51,319
Scott: Yep But you know the.

600
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,489
Scott: the thing is I totally lost it.

601
00:34:54,052 --> 00:35:04,090
Scott: All right It adds up your scores on your time trials and your high score mode and everything together and it looks at your world Ranking of all the players playing this game.

602
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,154
Scott: This is pretty much real time.

603
00:35:05,194 --> 00:35:09,852
Rym: like every time I log in it shows you've dropped X number and I gotta like get better scores To get up to.

604
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:14,230
Scott: so you're competing against everyone in the world who's also playing this game, which is apparently is right now.

605
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,698
Rym: Oh, it's like 30,000 people.

606
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:17,850
Scott: It depends tens of thousands of people, right?

607
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:26,287
Scott: So depending on which mode like you can see like oh only like a few thousand people have actually played the darkness mode Time trial all the way through, you know

608
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:35,279
Rym: My overall worldwide ranking like as of the last time I checked which was last night because it gives you the overall Ranking aggregate of everything you've done is like 1002 out of 28,000.

609
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:41,521
Rym: Yeah, I'm in the hundreds I think somewhere and I'm basically individual ones.

610
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:42,766
Rym: I'm all over the place some of them.

611
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,550
Rym: I'm in the double digits.

612
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,470
Scott: Yeah, some of them I'm no good and some of them I'm like insanely good.

613
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:47,802
Rym: So it's amazing playing cuz.

614
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:54,398
Rym: sometimes I'll do a round I think I did really badly and then my rank is way way low or well way high I guess or I'll do one.

615
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,130
Rym: I think I was doing awesome that I look and I'm like at the bottom of the pack.

616
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:57,713
Rym: I'm like what.

617
00:35:57,954 --> 00:36:01,754
Scott: what I really like is how the game really is true to its name of Championship Edition.

618
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:09,850
Scott: right a lot of games have the word Championship Edition, but this one really is Championship Edition, for example Let's say you do a time trial in 30 seconds and you do the time trick.

619
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:21,770
Scott: You want to try it again to see if you can beat your time it as when you get to 20 seconds It starts counting down 10 9 8 like there is no reason to play unless you are going to beat your previous score.

620
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,355
Scott: You know, it's pretty much you.

621
00:36:23,575 --> 00:36:28,470
Scott: only the game is entirely focused on get the high score improve improve improve do better.

622
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:32,670
Scott: You know get become the best in the world get an s-rank and everything go go go.

623
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:35,350
Scott: There is that is the only focus of this game.

624
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:40,910
Rym: This game has to be at some point of the Omega thon because it's too perfect for that.

625
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:45,430
Scott: Yeah, I only wish there was some sort of multiplayer or even co-op mode.

626
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:47,377
Scott: There's two of you working together.

627
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:49,906
Scott: get the highest score as a team.

628
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:51,110
Scott: That would be off the hook.

629
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:55,124
Rym: Well, we do have the other pac-man game that was delayed.

630
00:36:55,184 --> 00:36:55,927
Rym: that's coming out.

631
00:36:55,967 --> 00:37:04,583
Scott: Yeah, there is a game I saw at PAX that is coming out eventually or at least it's a prototype or something Which is pac-man battle royale and basically pac-man battle royale.

632
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:06,490
Scott: is you know a four player?

633
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:12,229
Scott: Everyone plays pac-man at the same time and you can turn into a big pac-man and eat the other pac-man's.

634
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:14,360
Scott: You know, I mean pac-man verse.

635
00:37:14,822 --> 00:37:16,370
Scott: which did we ever talk about that on the show?

636
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,400
Rym: I don't know, but it's one of the most brilliant games ever made.

637
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,304
Scott: we talked about versus.

638
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:21,950
Scott: that's the Miyamoto pac-man, right?

639
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,347
Rym: We talked about that at PAX in egregiously unrealized potential.

640
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:25,770
Rym: That's true.

641
00:37:26,052 --> 00:37:39,064
Scott: So pac-man verse if you haven't ever heard of it or played it It's a pac-man for the GameCube and the way you have to play it is you need one game boy advance Connected to the GameCube and you need three GameCube controllers, I believe right?

642
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:50,408
Scott: Yes, and one person with the Game Boy Looks Game Boy Advance looks at the screen on the Game Boy Advance and on that screen They play regular old pac-man like straight up.

643
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:57,094
Scott: But the other three people with the GameCube controllers look at the television and on the television They're playing.

644
00:37:57,635 --> 00:37:58,337
Scott: I'm a ghost.

645
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:02,630
Rym: eat pac-man and I can only see the area directly around me.

646
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:06,089
Scott: Yeah, and some if you eat a fruit you can get a slightly bigger view.

647
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:08,419
Scott: But the Pearson playing who's pac-man?

648
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,142
Scott: can see the whole map.

649
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:10,990
Rym: I'm so goddamn good at that game.

650
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:24,816
Scott: The game is really really good but what pac-man battle royale is is everyone is pac-man and this ghosts and You're trying to get the high score and beat everyone else, right and they're still working on that game But it looks promising at least.

651
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:29,070
Rym: but in terms of the experience of playing this new pac-man it is intense.

652
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,638
Rym: The music is pumping the style.

653
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:32,730
Scott: It's got the best fucking music style is off the.

654
00:38:32,972 --> 00:38:36,071
Scott: Oh, it's got the best fucking style styling.

655
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:40,344
Rym: it is amazing that this is a true and proper sequel to pac-man.

656
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:44,696
Scott: you could basically call this pac-man - I Think there was a pac-man - wasn't there?

657
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:47,850
Scott: No, this is now pac-man - this is as far as I'm concerned.

658
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,479
Scott: This is the pac-man that matters for the modern day, right?

659
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:53,569
Scott: You know, the old pac-man is an important historical artifact.

660
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:56,410
Scott: You know, you should probably play it sometimes learn about it.

661
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:03,179
Scott: You know get good at it if you must but if you really want to care about pac-man in the year 2010 It's pac-man CEDX.

662
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:04,728
Scott: That is the pac-man to pay attention to.

663
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:07,706
Scott: One person did point out though that it's an Xbox 360 game.

664
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,449
Scott: I don't think it's out for any other systems.

665
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,559
Scott: It might be but I don't think so.

666
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,010
Scott: at least the world rankings aren't definitely not.

667
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:21,167
Scott: I just realized how sad that is for Nintendo that world rankings are definitely not including anything but the Xbox 360.

668
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:27,290
Scott: So You're probably not going up against too many Japanese people which is why we're able to get such high scores.

669
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:32,700
Scott: Granted it is strange.

670
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:34,230
Scott: It's like the world championships.

671
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:36,980
Scott: You know all these twin galaxies are very u.s.

672
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,750
Scott: Centric in terms of the Donkey Kong's and the pac-man's.

673
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:49,990
Scott: You know the Japanese people might dominate at the fighting games and that sort of thing But maybe they're not really there for 40 hours playing a boring game that they've already saw.

674
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:55,830
Scott: They're not really dominating at these old-school, you know games, you know, at least as far as I know.

675
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:57,358
Scott: I think I blame it.

676
00:39:57,901 --> 00:39:59,550
Scott: I'm just gonna pull this right out now.

677
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:03,867
Scott: I blame it on the fact that they're mostly concentrating on the no skill RPG games.

678
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:07,649
Scott: No That's a burn is a burn but they are good at the fighting games.

679
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:12,730
Rym: Well, I mean if we're talking about Japan or just Asia in general cuz what about South Korea?

680
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:15,169
Scott: I was saying South Korea is not the same.

681
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,155
Rym: I was only talking about Japan.

682
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:19,350
Rym: Yep I don't know.

683
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:31,830
Rym: I think America might have more to do with the fact that the games were the focus of our culture like the games themselves Were the cultural focus where in Japan I think in the long run the characters and the nostalgia became more of the focus.

684
00:40:32,252 --> 00:40:35,412
Scott: No pac-man fever that wasn't from America It was.

685
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:39,505
Rym: but that what the focus of fandom was still on playing the games in the arcades.

686
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,010
Rym: and then arcade culture died.

687
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,950
Rym: But Japan still has arcade culture.

688
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:47,990
Rym: So maybe rather than thinking back fondly on the games that were in arcades people are still in arcades.

689
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:55,190
Scott: I also think that part of it was You know, there was a significant difference between our arcade culture and Japan's arcade culture.

690
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,456
Rym: Well theirs was like they had.

691
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:02,120
Rym: I love those those sets that had like two Opposite side screens and you'd fight with each other.

692
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,330
Scott: Yeah, well virtual on but it was sort of you know virtual on the sideways.

693
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:15,612
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is right is if you look it's like It's sort of a weird thing because look around at the arcade cabinets in the arcade right an old-school arcade and a lot of them Are Japanese.

694
00:41:15,712 --> 00:41:19,140
Scott: most in fact, you know, you got the Namco's and the Konami's and all that, right?

695
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:22,637
Scott: But pong was totally u.s.

696
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:23,520
Scott: Thing, right?

697
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,750
Scott: So I think what happened is we had this old-school arcade culture.

698
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:31,349
Scott: That's you know, this old retro, you know thing that you know.

699
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:42,183
Scott: It is as large place in the US because of pong right and the games that followed including the ones that came from Japan like pac-man in Japan because our case actually stuck around.

700
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:53,578
Scott: they're not a retro thing they're a constant thing even though they might be from what I hear diminishing right and As a result, you know The old goes out and the new comes in.

701
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:56,388
Scott: here the old went out and no no new came in.

702
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:02,049
Scott: So pac-man is still pretty much like, you know top tier arcade stuff in the US.

703
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:03,596
Scott: We didn't really replace it.

704
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:10,550
Scott: Whereas pac-man over there is like, you know It's old because now they're playing Street Fighter, you know, they replaced it and stuff.

705
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:13,560
Rym: But at least all that aside this game is fucking awesome.

706
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:19,650
Scott: Yeah, you got to play pac-man zedx, you know You have any other like pac-man memories?

707
00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:26,470
Scott: I know that I when I was a kid I had this vinyl record that had like a pac-man story and possibly some music on it.

708
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,461
Rym: I vaguely recall a pac-man cartoon, but it was terrible.

709
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,010
Scott: I think the vinyl record was related to the cartoon.

710
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,220
Rym: I mean really miss pac-man was my game because I had the Atari 7800.

711
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,082
Rym: I had miss pac-man 7800 at the real.

712
00:42:39,062 --> 00:42:39,248
Scott: you know

713
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:54,550
Rym: I played the ever living crap out of that game as a kid and I It's amazing because a lot of these like a lot of games that I think oh, I'll practice and get good like Street Fighter I mean fighting games didn't appear until I was much older and I did not try to get good at them as a kid.

714
00:42:54,631 --> 00:43:00,625
Rym: I didn't practice and it shows today Like I play Super Street Fighter despite all my trying and practicing not so good.

715
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:03,878
Rym: and yet finally Pac-man makes a comeback a game.

716
00:43:03,918 --> 00:43:04,782
Rym: I played the fuck out of.

717
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:06,549
Rym: I'm pretty goddamn awesome at it.

718
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:10,705
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing was is like I played that pac-man on the 2600 but then the 2600 broke.

719
00:43:12,314 --> 00:43:14,996
Scott: So I didn't really play it when I was older So didn't get good at it.

720
00:43:15,056 --> 00:43:22,909
Scott: and then not that it mattered to getting good at 2600 back And then I mostly played NES and I wasn't about to buy pac-man for the NES even though it did exist.

721
00:43:23,592 --> 00:43:25,219
Scott: Why would you buy pac-man for the NES?

722
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:28,533
Rym: of course back when I had an NES, you know, I'd play pac-man Arcades.

723
00:43:29,036 --> 00:43:30,785
Scott: Yeah, the thing is even arcades.

724
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:36,829
Scott: by that time I was playing like Ninja Turtles and x-men and you know, obviously I'd alternate I'd go I'd play the.

725
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:40,610
Scott: I played a pac-man once in a while in the arcade.

726
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:47,190
Scott: I didn't avoid it entirely But I wasn't throwing quarters into it to actually get any good or any memories or any experience.

727
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:52,215
Rym: See after our quarters in because it was the only game that was one quarter And that's pretty much.

728
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:58,077
Scott: what I would do is I would basically play all the two quarter games and then at the very end of The day when I had one quarter left I played one round of pac-man and I left

729
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:04,503
Rym: and later on before things ended remember those pseudo 3d Hologram looking Sega games that were like you're a cowboy don't die.

730
00:44:04,524 --> 00:44:05,467
Rym: Yeah, those are a quarter.

731
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,455
Rym: I played the crap out of those two.

732
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:09,323
Scott: really those those would be like a dollar.

733
00:44:09,444 --> 00:44:10,890
Scott: I was cuz it's a fancy hologram.

734
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:11,614
Rym: They were a quarter.

735
00:44:11,675 --> 00:44:12,762
Rym: cuz no one liked him anymore.

736
00:44:12,802 --> 00:44:14,090
Scott: That was way later.

737
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:19,350
Scott: Yeah, when people realize they're actually kind of terrible all those things were was a TV with a mirror and a dome.

738
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:20,474
Rym: Yeah, but it looked good.

739
00:44:20,975 --> 00:44:21,557
Scott: It looked all right.

740
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:24,086
Rym: It was just video was basically Dragon's Lair.

741
00:44:24,387 --> 00:44:27,009
Scott: Yes, basically There was a fighting game though that was in that thing.

742
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:30,244
Rym: There was and there was always a line for that and that one was still a doll.

743
00:44:30,284 --> 00:44:31,770
Rym: It was a terrible game.

744
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,578
Rym: Yeah, there was always a crazy line for it by the.

745
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:39,869
Scott: if you're gonna play that you might as well have played by killer instinct Where you can just type in a combo and walk away from the?

746
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:42,877
Scott: Even though I could never do that other people could.

747
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:46,371
Rym: the longest lives I ever saw were to this day for Mortal Kombat 3 More.

748
00:44:46,391 --> 00:44:55,630
Scott: look I saw the longest lines from Mortal Kombat 2 and Super Street Fighter 2 turbo And that was you know that was the big ones and where I came from anyway.

749
00:44:56,691 --> 00:44:58,398
Scott: Any other Pac Man's notes?

750
00:44:58,538 --> 00:44:58,699
Scott: No.

751
00:44:58,719 --> 00:44:59,562
Rym: I think I'm petering out.

752
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:00,626
Rym: I love this game.

753
00:45:00,727 --> 00:45:04,060
Rym: Pac Man is back And I feel like I also.

754
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:11,110
Scott: I just want to say I love Pac Man style in general Not so much Pac Man himself was kind of doofy, but the ghosts right thought Clyde watch out.

755
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:12,215
Rym: So what's your job?

756
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:15,210
Rym: I don't remember the names, but what's your favorite style in the game?

757
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,874
Scott: Inky-pinky Blinky and Clyde.

758
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:22,650
Rym: because like there's styles ranging from like a Lego looking thing to a retro thing to like line art.

759
00:45:23,132 --> 00:45:26,689
Scott: I said I like this the style that I believe it on the default style for each level.

760
00:45:27,021 --> 00:45:28,053
Scott: Yep But I like the.

761
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:29,820
Scott: I like the one that's in challenge to.

762
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:32,289
Scott: you know that the first one and I like the dungeon one.

763
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,062
Rym: I love that also ultra retro one.

764
00:45:35,183 --> 00:45:36,730
Scott: Yeah, and the half one is alright.

765
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:42,388
Rym: In fact the dungeon one is almost more retro than is possible like it's worse than the original Pac Man.

766
00:45:42,468 --> 00:45:45,970
Rym: Yeah Which makes it kind of endearing in a Minecraft kind of way.

767
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:47,660
Scott: Yeah It's kind of like a minecraft.

768
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,406
Rym: music is just well.

769
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:51,065
Rym: I feel like we could do a whole panel at like a Pac's.

770
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:57,609
Rym: that was just Music and games and how very few games have gotten it right of messy games that have done it right.

771
00:45:57,669 --> 00:45:57,870
Scott: tribes.

772
00:45:58,571 --> 00:46:00,135
Rym: Wait wait wait.

773
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,360
Rym: done it right because there's different ways to do it right.

774
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,430
Scott: tribes to doom Mega Man Zelda Pac Man CEDX.

775
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,389
Rym: We're talking about the kind of music that pumps you up and keeps you pumped up.

776
00:46:10,691 --> 00:46:22,630
Rym: Yeah, because doom 2 and doom had some of the best music for them And tribes to just think it's perhaps remember had that dynamic music.

777
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:25,063
Rym: We're depending on what was going on around you in the game.

778
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:26,109
Rym: the music would change.

779
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:32,546
Scott: Mostly what it would do is it would just choose Whether it should restart the track or increase the volume or decrease the volume.

780
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:33,610
Scott: It wasn't that dynamic?

781
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,522
Rym: no, it was more dynamic than you remember.

782
00:46:35,562 --> 00:46:40,086
Rym: you would add loops as Like if you got into a firefight with someone or your health was low.

783
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:47,157
Rym: it would add loops Uh-huh, and in the beginning, I mean remember it would play the normal music and then it when it was loading That was pretty much the key is.

784
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:52,630
Scott: all the songs and tribes to were designed Such that they would start while the loading screen was there And

785
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:53,153
Rym: then you hit the

786
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:59,009
Scott: ground and it would slowly build up and then as soon as the game started That would be like the go go go part of the song.

787
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,156
Rym: They're like, yeah, come on.

788
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:00,539
Rym: Come on.

789
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:02,410
Scott: Yeah, it'd be like you're sitting there while it's loading.

790
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:07,979
Rym: It's like well, I mean meanwhile even counter-strike today great game And I'm waiting for my next round.

791
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,003
Rym: I'm not sitting there going.

792
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:09,304
Rym: Yeah.

793
00:47:09,364 --> 00:47:09,886
Rym: Yeah, come on.

794
00:47:09,926 --> 00:47:10,127
Rym: Yeah.

795
00:47:10,147 --> 00:47:10,930
Rym: Yeah, I'm just sitting there going.

796
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:13,309
Scott: Yeah, when tribes 2 is loading it like.

797
00:47:18,392 --> 00:47:22,547
Scott: And then as soon as the game started back tent tent tent tent tent tent tent.

798
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:23,470
Scott: it was awesome.

799
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,118
Scott: And pac-man does the same thing.

800
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:26,042
Scott: This is my Batman.

801
00:47:26,203 --> 00:47:27,710
Rym: I sweat a lot playing this back.

802
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,219
Scott: The thing is the original pac-man.

803
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:31,050
Scott: or I think about the music in the original pac-man.

804
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:31,924
Scott: It was basically we.

805
00:47:34,891 --> 00:47:35,654
Scott: And how did that?

806
00:47:35,714 --> 00:47:36,698
Scott: how was that not?

807
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:38,826
Rym: annoying is all it was annoying.

808
00:47:38,946 --> 00:47:40,030
Rym: I turned the music die.

809
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,006
Rym: I basically muted it every time I played him as pack.

810
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:47,030
Scott: really Because if you just listen to that we on its own you're like shut it off.

811
00:47:47,911 --> 00:47:53,449
Scott: But if I actually go to an arcade machine and play pac-man the we doesn't bother me for so I don't know what it is, dude

812
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:59,230
Rym: If we ever do a panel on game music I'm gonna have a clip of that and just play it in the background for like five minutes while we're doing the panel.

813
00:47:59,734 --> 00:48:00,982
Scott: No, I just piss people off.

814
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:01,788
Rym: It would make a good point.

815
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:18,472
Scott: Remember pac-man Cheetah man, it's just the siren What?

816
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:27,970
Scott: well I wonder I would like to know you know, cuz there's always those fun facts about old games Right what made them choose that siren as the pac-man noise and what made them, you know?

817
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,000
Scott: I mean I could understand the waka waka waka waka.

818
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,950
Rym: Well pac-man was originally puck manage.

819
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:35,730
Scott: I know that there's nothing to do with the siren or the waka waka waka.

820
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,943
Scott: I want to know where this though a siren and the waka waka came from.

821
00:48:38,386 --> 00:48:42,681
Rym: and also the When you died, that's a generic sound in death sound.

822
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:44,707
Scott: Yeah, but they came up with it, right?

823
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:45,650
Scott: So who came up?

824
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:50,650
Scott: I'm pretty sure games before pac-man had similar deaths, but who came up with that particular sound and when he was working on it?

825
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:51,173
Rym: I don't know.

826
00:48:51,193 --> 00:48:57,787
Rym: It's like asking a Foley artist like alright in this movie What made you think to make the like the claws sound just like this?

827
00:48:57,808 --> 00:48:58,390
Rym: it's like I don't know.

828
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:03,323
Scott: I took a watermelon I shot it and then Yeah, but you know for other things people do have.

829
00:49:03,403 --> 00:49:04,750
Scott: you know, there's origin stories.

830
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:12,247
Rym: I mean, I made some sound effects for some people's games at RIT just for my music classes and I basically just made like whatever.

831
00:49:12,368 --> 00:49:16,823
Scott: I was Use my thing of the day from a couple weeks ago the FS 6 or whatever.

832
00:49:16,843 --> 00:49:17,084
Scott: Yes.

833
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:20,472
Rym: I should have used that in 2003.

834
00:49:20,472 --> 00:49:22,720
Rym: I basically just dicked around in a synthesizer.

835
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,229
Rym: then I was like, alright, that sounds good, but that's the death sound.

836
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:25,630
Rym: whatever.

837
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,101
Rym: It was just a random sound that I thought sounded cool.

838
00:49:28,402 --> 00:49:30,230
Rym: There was no rhyme or reason at all.

839
00:49:36,805 --> 00:49:39,340
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
