1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,136
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, April 20th.

2
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:11,838
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:13,402
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:22,688
Rym: Tonight on the DS heroes of Might and Magic Tonight on the DS Might and Magic clash of heroes.

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:25,902
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:33,350
Scott: So you remember that show we did where we talked about how people literally do not see the text on the computer screen.

7
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:35,676
Scott: They literally do not see.

8
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:38,948
Scott: I have found another example of literally do not see.

9
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:39,590
Rym: all right.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,273
Rym: What do you see?

11
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:43,870
Scott: pedestrians literally do not see anyone on a bicycle?

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:53,850
Scott: Basically, you know, they're there's they're getting ready to cross the street and the red and white lights That doesn't mean shit to them, right, you know, just like you and me red and white light doesn't mean shit, right?

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:01,876
Scott: So as soon as the last car is gone, and they don't see any cars coming that it's time to go They do not see bicycles.

14
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:09,230
Scott: there could be a hundred bicycles behind that last car and they'll just go, right See what I've discovered is that I at least myself see the bicycles.

15
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:11,983
Rym: But is that just possibly because of the zebra storyteller?

16
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:13,350
Rym: because I am in fact a bicyclist?

17
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:14,680
Scott: So, you know what the solution?

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:24,410
Scott: that there is solution though Yeah, you have to use your gay ass Bell which is required and all Noise-making device is required on all bicycles and yet to use it.

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:33,210
Rym: So I actually I had a trouble with that when I was a kid because I did not have a bell on my bicycle Or horn is required by law at least in the city.

20
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:40,879
Rym: I was one stopped by a police officer When I was young and he said, you know you ran a red light and all these other things.

21
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,389
Rym: then he's like and you don't have any sort of noise-making device.

22
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,875
Rym: and I got into a long argument.

23
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:55,830
Rym: and finally he let me go on the grounds that I can clap loud enough to Constitute a noise-making device of the proper decibel level, but you can't do it while your hands are on the handlebar.

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,425
Rym: Yeah, but I can ride without my hands on the handlebars if you can't do that.

25
00:01:58,446 --> 00:01:59,190
Rym: You shouldn't be biking.

26
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:04,715
Scott: I'm just saying is that the point is that it you know, that's like saying oh well It's okay to have.

27
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:07,950
Scott: you know, your car has this safety device, but it requires two hands.

28
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,318
Scott: You have to take your hands off the wheel.

29
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:10,990
Scott: Yeah, but I can drive with my knees.

30
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,610
Rym: Okay, you can yell out enough to and the thing is but I really don't feel like yelling proper way around.

31
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,070
Rym: This is one really you should just yell get the fuck out the way as you're going.

32
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:28,870
Rym: But if that if you don't feel like it Why don't we just make a bell that is actually a little mp3 player and a loudspeaker that plays your voice or maybe some?

33
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,070
Rym: Better stronger voice yelling get the fuck out the way.

34
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,033
Scott: well They'd have to.

35
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:43,830
Scott: so happens that there is a crude and lewd a rap song that I remember from the olden days because I think my brother used to To quote it quite often in the ruder and or luder than get the fucking out the way.

36
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:49,669
Scott: The chorus of the song I believe is pretty much move bitch get out the way and that's pretty much it.

37
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:52,524
Scott: It's just like move bitch get out the way.

38
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:53,450
Rym: So maybe that's the solution.

39
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:54,789
Scott: The way bitch get out.

40
00:02:56,952 --> 00:03:02,870
Rym: The thing is my problem isn't so much that the bicyclists just they keep running the fucking red light and hitting me.

41
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:05,830
Rym: It's not the fact that I just go and I don't see him.

42
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:08,325
Rym: I see him that I go anyway because they got a red light.

43
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:16,092
Scott: Yeah It's interesting like which bicycle people will stop for red lights and which won't and when they'll stop at a red light and when they Won't.

44
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,810
Scott: and you know, I've sort of found a happy medium.

45
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:22,810
Scott: Of course, you know when I started out, I just stopped at everything for the full duration.

46
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:29,540
Scott: But now it's like okay if I'm on the left side of the street right next to the sidewalk And I'm making a left turn and I'm gonna stay next to the sidewalk.

47
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:31,950
Scott: I can just go whenever it's okay to go.

48
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,230
Rym: I thought really, you know, I follow California rules.

49
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:44,850
Rym: I don't know what parts of California do this But apparently there are places where the law is that for bicyclists stop signs count as yield signs as opposed to stop signs.

50
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:55,869
Scott: you know if it's like if it's like a one-way if I'm crossing over a one-way and I see that there's no car on the Right and they have a stop sign there and there's no one stopped at the stop sign Then you can just go right across, you know

51
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,512
Rym: the rationale.

52
00:03:56,532 --> 00:04:02,689
Rym: think of this is that it the the disruption caused to traffic by bicyclists stopping and starting again because of the time it Takes to get up to speed.

53
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:09,799
Rym: It's safer for them to just basically run stop signs as long as they would have had the right of way Otherwise by treating it a yield regardless.

54
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,990
Scott: They still stop far more often than everyone else.

55
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:22,849
Scott: The other weird thing I'll see people do right is like this is bicyclists to just like hate Stopping and what they'll do is they'll get to a light or something Around right waiting to go.

56
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:30,670
Rym: So I I've discovered those people almost Universally just don't actually know how to ride their bike and they have their seat way too high.

57
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:35,769
Rym: So when they stop the bike falls to the side and they can't easily kind of jump to get it up again.

58
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,701
Rym: Every person I've ever seen doing that has their bike configured incorrectly.

59
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:41,006
Scott: I see the thing is I?

60
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,250
Scott: some of the people I see doodling.

61
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:49,050
Scott: It's like they just don't want to lose, you know momentums That's what I see a lot, but it takes more work to maintain that doodly-doodly-doodly.

62
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:51,458
Scott: I don't know as me.

63
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,303
Scott: I'm not the doodler.

64
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:53,630
Rym: I might just stop it.

65
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,390
Rym: I just continue rolling because rollerblades are the best of both worlds.

66
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:09,070
Scott: I guess if I can jump on the sidewalk and in and out of people and just go But only if it's really empty Yeah, and only if I really have to like, you know There'll be three cars stacked right and I can't get in between.

67
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:22,850
Rym: What amazes me is it was it's so annoying on the sidewalk because there's slow people just kind of waddling around People people walking I've realized and the faster you're going the more you notice it are Incredibly erratic in their movements.

68
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,179
Rym: They kind of just drift to the left drift to the right arm flying out with a cigarette on the end of it all over The place.

69
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:35,677
Rym: Yep but I ended up walking the route that I normally rollerblade because I wanted to sit down somewhere else everyone to restore and put on my blades.

70
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:41,370
Rym: and Normally when I rollerblade on the sidewalk I'm slowed down by the slow people in my way and I get kind of irritated.

71
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:44,760
Rym: So I walked and it was equally irritating.

72
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,204
Rym: I went just as fast I had.

73
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:47,126
Rym: I've been rollerblading.

74
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:48,290
Rym: people are just slow.

75
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:52,843
Rym: The people are also anyway, yeah, but I've been playing a lot of DDR.

76
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:55,170
Rym: Uh-huh, and I'm very happy in the kit.

77
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,285
Scott: So you realize yeah, I would be playing DDR cuz I got it all set up.

78
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:00,234
Scott: I got the step mania I got these songs.

79
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,499
Scott: I got my pad.

80
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,904
Scott: I got the home theater PC.

81
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:04,289
Scott: Yeah, but you know, what?

82
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:10,568
Scott: Reason I'm not playing DDR is because instead I am doing things that are the opposite of shit.

83
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,008
Scott: talking meanwhile you Shit talking still about what?

84
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:23,859
Rym: e-commerce anything other than that everything such as any all shit, I Would like one piece of shit.

85
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:25,249
Scott: every poop you have talked it.

86
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:34,806
Rym: That's That's the private Twitter Can't lift ten poops, but you realize there's a new version of step mania.

87
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:39,193
Scott: That's like alpha alpha alpha Really and it uses I'm not sure which one I have It's got.

88
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:48,469
Rym: you would know it looks completely different from the one you know in love okay, but I tried it because there was this crazy delay like so profound that I could not dance.

89
00:06:48,489 --> 00:07:03,949
Rym: and Basically, what I discovered was that there is a point one one two Millisecond delay between me stepping on an arrow that arrow being transferred to the ps1 controller to the ps1 to USB converter to the Mac.

90
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:05,714
Rym: That is the problem.

91
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:13,296
Rym: the fucking Mac and the way it handles the USB device that I plug my ps1 controller into Introduces this point one millisecond delay.

92
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:17,549
Scott: This is why you know OS X is really just not you can't be.

93
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,881
Scott: you know Even though like steam is coming out for it.

94
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,430
Scott: The gaming is just gonna be terrible.

95
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:26,447
Scott: It does absolutely no support for input devices or any of these things.

96
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,130
Scott: that it was amazing.

97
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,932
Rym: I tried it.

98
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:30,160
Rym: I used the keyboard and I used a gamepad.

99
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,330
Rym: that like other things that I plugged in and there was no delay.

100
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:35,264
Rym: It was only and there's no delay in Windows.

101
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:38,780
Rym: if I use that device It's just that device in OS 10 causes a point.

102
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:40,487
Rym: one one two millisecond delay.

103
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:47,563
Scott: exactly Games right people don't realize PC games computer games and even console games.

104
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:53,118
Scott: They basically just need like raw Hardware access like full-on.

105
00:07:53,178 --> 00:08:02,049
Scott: right but OS X with all its niceties and user interface What all these Steve Jobs things when you when you build an application on top of that?

106
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:03,694
Scott: That's fine.

107
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,990
Scott: if you're making like a web browser or something, you know, something like that.

108
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,710
Scott: But if you're making a game you need that shit to get out the way.

109
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:17,708
Scott: Right, you just need the hardware in your game and you need everything else to move aside.

110
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:24,118
Scott: interesting You know, that's why like Microsoft DirectX is called, you know That's why it was called direct from the beginning.

111
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:34,668
Scott: right is because it basically let you bypass like all this, you know It was a new API to go direct between your program Direct X then the drivers and you basically went around all those windows.

112
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:40,390
Scott: bullshit Grabbed your full-screen display device and through your 3ds up there, you know, that's what DirectX and directory.

113
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,210
Rym: What's interesting though?

114
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:49,213
Rym: Is that all that precision for gaming is actually pretty shitty if you use it in the rest of the computer like OS 10 is a Wonderful experience.

115
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:50,679
Rym: until you want to play a game on no, it's.

116
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,401
Scott: it's a pretty.

117
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:52,707
Scott: I think it's a terrible experience.

118
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:56,561
Rym: all around though My I've got that SteelSeries laser mouse, which I still.

119
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,830
Rym: I recommend that to anyone who cares about their input.

120
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,213
Rym: This mouse is maybe I should get like I cannot Express to you.

121
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:06,989
Rym: I can't even begin to overstate how wonderful this mouse is.

122
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:09,470
Scott: I mean the thing is so I plugged it.

123
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:10,614
Scott: We need to be so.

124
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,943
Scott: he needs to gut like a regular old logitech mouse.

125
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:17,398
Scott: put it in the same exact case as that one And then do the double-blind test to see.

126
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,270
Rym: you know, yeah, the thing is I've done customizations with this mouse.

127
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:25,190
Rym: You know within the individual like the response rate that you can't do in software with a logitech.

128
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,979
Scott: Yeah, but has it helped you or not?

129
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:27,502
Scott: We don't know.

130
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:28,044
Rym: I think so.

131
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:30,472
Scott: It could be psychosomatic Plus.

132
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:31,274
Rym: it just feels nice.

133
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:37,500
Rym: It doesn't work so well in OSM though, but all that aside speaking of raw Input and playing games.

134
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:39,069
Rym: There's been a lot of buzz about the.

135
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:46,906
Rym: so You know people always talk about when the next-gen shooter comes out Even though the next-gen shooter has always been like five gens back if you count old PC shooters.

136
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:50,939
Rym: Yep, but Body count apparently everyone's talking about it.

137
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:52,946
Rym: Like it's the new first-person shooter.

138
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:53,709
Scott: I've never heard of it.

139
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:55,159
Rym: I'd never heard of it is it?

140
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:59,923
Rym: but there's a bunch of buzz about it And I what I want to skip to is they make a huge.

141
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,690
Rym: just tell me if you've heard this before.

142
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:02,834
Scott: The dike.

143
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:03,677
Scott: it's a dike atana.

144
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:04,158
Scott: Let me guess.

145
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:05,222
Rym: It's not a dike atana.

146
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:05,724
Rym: It's not.

147
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:07,149
Rym: we have revolutionary AI.

148
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:09,825
Rym: It's another claim that has been made in the past.

149
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:12,611
Scott: All right Quote.

150
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:14,300
Rym: it is not just about effects.

151
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:15,425
Rym: It's about access.

152
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:19,902
Rym: in body count You can blow chunks out of interior walls your fortune.

153
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:20,865
Scott: Yeah faction.

154
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:23,533
Rym: It is the blow shit up Game they make.

155
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:29,588
Rym: they keep talking about how you want to hide behind a crate and check out the business shoot a hole in the crate and then peek through the hole.

156
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:32,777
Rym: and That's all anyone has to say about this game.

157
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:37,356
Rym: other than you can crouch and then and here's where everyone They lost me.

158
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:44,910
Rym: and then you can use the left stick to peek Do a little peek and peek around the corner like this is some new revolutionary thing that no one's thought to do.

159
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:45,452
Scott: Yeah, okay.

160
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:57,130
Scott: So soldier of fortune had peeking right mech warrior 2 for MS das Tie fighter and any various other descent any number of 3d games or you know games that were at least in quote.

161
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,910
Rym: It's natural.

162
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:05,633
Rym: It's allowed to control units adaptive and it will surely consign the whole locking on mechanic to the graveyard of cover system history The first way.

163
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:06,936
Scott: it's a console game.

164
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,921
Rym: the first I said left stick.

165
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:12,834
Rym: Oh, right the first post on slash dots Mm-hmm.

166
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:14,550
Rym: I'm going to read it in its entirety.

167
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:22,930
Rym: Will this also be available on a system with an input controller suitable for shooters like say a mouse?

168
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:34,210
Rym: It amazes me that for all I pay attention to gaming I'd never heard of this game and a lot of people are talking about how they think it's gonna be this next-gen game.

169
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,650
Rym: But it looks like it's just rehashing a bunch of tricks from games five and ten years ago.

170
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:48,310
Scott: And then basically we had Halo which was like Goldeneye Unreal tournament level of game and now they're stepping up to like the soldier of fortune level of game on the console.

171
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,886
Scott: So how many years will it be before you've got like?

172
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:58,427
Scott: and I'll never Never will there be NS level or tribes to level of game on the console.

173
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:06,429
Rym: It will never happen Considering I had difficulty mapping enough buttons in weapons factory on my keyboard, which is plenty of buttons.

174
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,215
Rym: So What do you got for me captain news?

175
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:21,519
Scott: So I said before on the show a long time ago I think around the time that you know bionic commando and Megaman 9 bionic commander re-armed and 3d 3d by yeah, no died.

176
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,753
Scott: I had a commander reunder.

177
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:27,346
Scott: Megaman 9 came out that Capcom was the company that knew the business right.

178
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:34,383
Scott: and in terms of all game Developers, you know at the time The only ones who are really know what was up was Capcom.

179
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:38,257
Scott: and well Capcom had their event in Hawaii And they had a nice Hawaiian theme.

180
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:39,903
Scott: they had captivate 2010.

181
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:41,430
Scott: Capcom captivate pretty good, huh?

182
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,569
Scott: Yeah, and it was cool to have it in Hawaii, which is sort of like the Japan us halfway point, you know.

183
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:50,570
Scott: But anyway, they came out with a whole bunch of announcements.

184
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,749
Scott: First of all, I didn't realize it was next week, but Super Street Fighter 4 is coming next week.

185
00:12:55,411 --> 00:13:06,131
Scott: But on June 15th, it's gonna have a DLC tournament mode and basically the online multiplayer features of Super Street Fighter 4 are going to be Insane.

186
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:12,410
Scott: you can have group battles where it's like us four versus you four, you know, so it's like oh you better fight this guy.

187
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:14,443
Scott: Oh you bet, you know that kind of stuff going on.

188
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,470
Scott: right team teamwork.

189
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:16,313
Scott: They got.

190
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:23,282
Scott: tournaments were like the tournament guy can like manage the bracket and like you can start up a tournament But not everyone actually has to be connected at the beginning.

191
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:26,828
Rym: Oh Goro design tournaments you could.

192
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,034
Scott: yeah You know you could.

193
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:36,296
Scott: so it's like I can set up a tournament for eight people and if only two people are there they play their bracket and then we wait for everyone else to show up and then they you know We could do it like that.

194
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:39,390
Scott: You could do basically all sorts of wicked awesome stuff.

195
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:44,010
Rym: This is not good is gonna be like it's not good at all because I gave up fighting games.

196
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:46,360
Rym: I've not played fighting games in a long time.

197
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,922
Rym: Mm-hmm.

198
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:48,870
Rym: I don't really want to go down that road again.

199
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,154
Scott: Oh you gave up fighting games.

200
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:53,766
Scott: Well, you might be interested to note the the trailer for Marvel vs.

201
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:59,159
Scott: Capcom 3 Including now that there's two really interesting things.

202
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,063
Scott: number one, right?

203
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:06,045
Scott: I know it's probably not gonna happen, but They really just need to come out with thousands of characters in one game.

204
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:06,608
Scott: why not?

205
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:15,807
Scott: I mean, you know Marvel's Capcom 2 had an insane number of characters But why can't they just have it where they have every character at least every character that anyone cares about.

206
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:21,109
Scott: or in the very least Is it really gonna take them that long to make every character if they had a nice enough sprinkling of?

207
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:26,346
Scott: The the weird ass care at least at least 50, you know or a hundred.

208
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,516
Scott: then I would be like, okay That is enough character.

209
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,749
Rym: I'd be okay with reskins like in smash.

210
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:32,850
Scott: Yeah, you don't want reskins.

211
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,480
Scott: But what you can do is you can do sort of like.

212
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,190
Scott: you can like patch together things, right?

213
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,690
Scott: For example, like, you know Iron Man shoots a blast of fire from his fist or whatever, right?

214
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,332
Scott: And then Silver Surfer can have the same, you know blast.

215
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:52,450
Scott: but then Silver Surfer also has like a flying move and you can give him the same flying it like attack with a Surfboard that spider-man has when he swings on a rope, you know.

216
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,655
Scott: So you can mix it up like that.

217
00:14:53,997 --> 00:15:07,172
Scott: where there's just this there's a set of moves and each character sort of has different Combinations of the pre-existing moves as opposed to say Mortal Kombat where it's the exact same character in a different color But anyway Right.

218
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:11,790
Scott: So the other interesting things about this number one right Resident Evil dude is in the game.

219
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:12,873
Scott: So they're really.

220
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:13,997
Scott: they're getting creative like.

221
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:20,177
Rym: the greatest thing is the picture here and it shows like all the characters standing there ready for their Melee, he's just holding his gun.

222
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:21,121
Rym: Like hey guys.

223
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,410
Rym: Yeah, they I fear for the martial arts term.

224
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:29,990
Scott: I'm hoping to get really creative with which characters they bring in especially on you know, I guess on both sides, right?

225
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,670
Scott: It's like on the Marvel side.

226
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:37,249
Scott: They should start bringing in like some cosmic outer space dudes, which didn't make a really big presence in the.

227
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,297
Scott: you know They had Thanos.

228
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:44,639
Scott: I guess, you know maybe bring in like Ego the living planet something like that, right?

229
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:45,481
Scott: That'd be freaking awesome.

230
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:47,587
Rym: This is where you lose me right Galactus.

231
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:48,149
Scott: That'd be cool.

232
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:55,368
Scott: But maybe if in Capcom side why not bring in like Phoenix Wright why not bring in?

233
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,981
Scott: I don't know Frickin, I can't even think anything.

234
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:07,070
Scott: but you know, there's plenty of Wood man wood man, you know some of the man's cuz they had Megaman but they didn't have proto man, right?

235
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:07,411
Scott: Or don't?

236
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:08,319
Scott: no one can be proto man.

237
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:08,783
Scott: Just dr.

238
00:16:08,824 --> 00:16:12,202
Scott: Wily straight up He comes out flying in a giant machine and you do damage to him.

239
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,850
Scott: the machine blows up and then he's just standing there.

240
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,526
Rym: Maybe all of his attacks are just bringing other robot masters to do their man.

241
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:19,530
Scott: Oh, that'd be freaking awesome.

242
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,259
Scott: I'd be great like wood man move.

243
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,646
Scott: Oh, what's the move for quick man?

244
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,028
Scott: I forget.

245
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:23,370
Scott: Oh shit.

246
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,215
Scott: So anyway, but the other the engine.

247
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:36,210
Scott: other interesting thing is that the rent they got this MT framework, which is like Capcom's internal Engine they're using for this game Apparently the like the in-game models.

248
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:42,210
Scott: They look like just like art straight from a Marvel comic book like it like you're playing the game and just your guy on screen.

249
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:49,450
Scott: It looks like some dude drew it and it's a you know Any still image looks like it was drawn on a Marvel comic book page every single one.

250
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,750
Scott: It's like unbelievable that they and these aren't even like final images.

251
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,036
Scott: They're still doing work on this.

252
00:16:55,136 --> 00:17:04,170
Scott: but they ever they put up these screenshots or of like, you know Rendered models and it looks like just you know, like some dude drew it and I'm like they just copied that have a comic book.

253
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,732
Rym: That is weird.

254
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:08,869
Rym: Oh, they look a lot more like a straight up still then something that would actually be fluid.

255
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:13,670
Scott: It looks like someone drew it inked it and printed it and that you know, but it's a 3d model somewhere.

256
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,055
Scott: So that's kind of crazy.

257
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:18,367
Rym: Then they also announced that they're releasing the sequel to Okami.

258
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,357
Scott: finally Oh that no, it's not a sequel.

259
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:20,839
Scott: Apparently.

260
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:26,877
Scott: It's a I don't know what they called it The DS sequel to Okami.

261
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:27,982
Rym: Oh, come again.

262
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:34,546
Scott: No, I read that it was the DS spiritual successor not sequel spiritual success.

263
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:47,890
Scott: Yeah So you'll be able to take your DS or whatever and paint every single tree in the whole world with your stylus Which would be you know, maybe gonna be a lot better than doing it with you know, the Wiimote.

264
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:53,390
Rym: There's a chance they didn't follow the same Mechanic of do a million boring things for 40 hours that are coming.

265
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,030
Rym: I'm gonna take a wait-and-see approach on that but what I'm most excited about is still bionic commander.

266
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:58,790
Rym: We are because what did we say way back?

267
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,307
Rym: We said the remake is the awesome game and that 3d one is gonna fail.

268
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:03,950
Rym: and what happened?

269
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:04,513
Scott: It was right.

270
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:06,262
Rym: The 3d one was a disaster.

271
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:07,729
Rym: I don't think anyone even remembers it.

272
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,900
Rym: And yet bionic commander rearmed was crazy popular.

273
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,870
Scott: The thing is I'm worried because bionic commander rearmed too.

274
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,850
Scott: It looks like they have it right, but I didn't hear any music.

275
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:23,827
Rym: So, I don't know if the music is as good because the music honestly I'll say straight up was half the game solid half of what made that game awesome.

276
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,875
Scott: and number two You can jump.

277
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:26,940
Scott: so it's like well, what the fuck?

278
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,325
Scott: This isn't even bionic commando anymore.

279
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:29,450
Scott: What the hell is this jumping?

280
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:32,522
Rym: My only hope is that jumping is not always available.

281
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:34,390
Scott: No, it looks like jumping is always a bit.

282
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,990
Scott: Oh, maybe there could be an item that allows the jumping but it looked like it's just a tiny hop.

283
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:43,130
Scott: So it's like they'll have something just out of the reach of your hook and you jump a little bit and now you can hook It.

284
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:45,077
Rym: it'll only be worth it if he actually goes doesn't?

285
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:50,955
Scott: it doesn't look to me like he can jump, you know Marioing anything that's.

286
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:53,970
Scott: no it looks like it's a very tiny jump, but it's a jump nonetheless.

287
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:57,570
Rym: I am NOT dubious only because that they you know.

288
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,610
Scott: The thing is there might be situations you have to like use the jump to go over a bullet or something.

289
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,210
Scott: It's like a dodging bullets with jumping is annoying.

290
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:10,050
Rym: The thing is I trust them because rearmed was one of the most satisfying gaming experiences I had since portal.

291
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,181
Scott: Yeah, at least it graphically looks pretty much right in line.

292
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:15,047
Scott: Yeah, Mega Man 10 is already out.

293
00:19:15,128 --> 00:19:16,924
Rym: So I didn't even be.

294
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:21,547
Scott: nine Capcom is still what I said, you know how maybe a year ago.

295
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,209
Scott: if not, right?

296
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,160
Scott: Capcom is still the number one game company right now.

297
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:29,610
Scott: if game companies want to make money do a Capcom's doing.

298
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:31,300
Scott: They got it, right.

299
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:32,149
Scott: You got it wrong.

300
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,714
Rym: So things of the day.

301
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:47,920
Rym: Oh shit This is just too funny and I have to push off another thing of the day just to get this out here.

302
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:59,142
Rym: You might have seen it but Kotaku has a short little story about a concerned parent who Discovered that his son had been banned from Xbox Live until the year 99 99 Mm-hmm.

303
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:00,286
Scott: So why did?

304
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:01,551
Scott: why did it ban you until 1999?

305
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:04,040
Scott: Why don't they just say permanent ban?

306
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:05,713
Scott: Why do they have to set a date on it?

307
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:06,480
Rym: I don't know.

308
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:14,839
Rym: I kind of like the idea though of that ban because theoretically, you know in the year 99 99 that kid can show his dick again.

309
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:16,285
Scott: Theoretically, I guess.

310
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:17,771
Rym: so the father, you know didn't.

311
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,920
Scott: he could also just get another account.

312
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:20,523
Scott: It's not like.

313
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:21,890
Scott: that's the only thing I understand about this.

314
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,855
Rym: God is Xbox Live.

315
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,780
Rym: You're paying for gold.

316
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,916
Rym: You have to give up all your shit to make a new account.

317
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,839
Rym: Yes Oh big deal that most people care about that.

318
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,147
Rym: All right, someone cared enough to get.

319
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,933
Scott: all you want to do is play games online.

320
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:34,057
Scott: You can just play.

321
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:34,800
Scott: get another guy.

322
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:41,252
Rym: Yes, but if someone cared enough to get their reputation get their points and get all these things They're not gonna give them up just to get a new account.

323
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:47,500
Rym: Mmm, but Regardless, I mean, I think you just put too much on the stock and the fact that other people care about these things.

324
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,160
Rym: Okay, the father posted in the public Xbox forum, you know, hey, that's a pretty cool dad.

325
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:53,379
Scott: He's smart enough to go do that.

326
00:20:53,801 --> 00:21:08,759
Rym: I would like to know why my son's account was banned until 31 12 99 99 without any notification and The response from the Xbox Microsoft enforcer guy was and I quote Your son was exposing himself on camera in Uno.

327
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:11,207
Scott: Yep, that's pretty typical of Uno.

328
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:14,657
Scott: I mean basically the chat roulette of Xbox, right?

329
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:16,406
Rym: I Mean, it's not like.

330
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,957
Rym: Uno is a game That's for sure.

331
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:20,968
Scott: That's it.

332
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:21,940
Scott: that's it okay.

333
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:28,720
Scott: So I've always said and I'm pretty sure it's true right that the read that you know We look at all this bad typing on the internet.

334
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,440
Scott: You're like people saying I love you and they spell love Lu V and these little you and letter R.

335
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:35,939
Rym: It's just people who don't know how to type.

336
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,106
Scott: Yeah, I think you know a lot of.

337
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:43,420
Scott: I think older people attribute it to kids with like having no grammar or no writing skills.

338
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:47,440
Scott: But I really think it's just no typing skills and that that you know.

339
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,705
Scott: They still they can't type.

340
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:58,940
Scott: so they're hunting and pecking and trying to use as little few letters as possible and also Texting, you know on a cell phone with digits one through nine because most kids don't have smartphones that have full keyboards or whatever.

341
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:08,175
Scott: So, you know doing that, you know that typing leads them to you know Right in this way and then that writing in that way carries back to writing by hand and so forth.

342
00:22:08,998 --> 00:22:19,260
Scott: So I Think that this person here on this website I'm linking to which is called hyperbole and a half dot blog spot comm made a bunch of funny comics.

343
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:27,067
Scott: How every time they see some bad writing on the internet they imagine that it's a person with just two fingers and one of them is mangled.

344
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:40,530
Scott: and how they imagine, you know, whatever someone writes a lot as one word and not two words that they imagine this monster called the a lot and they draw the a lot and there's a picture of an a lot.

345
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:48,660
Scott: and then you know, there's a picture of Someone caring about this a lot and a picture of a lot of fire and a lot of mist

346
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,010
Rym: I think you got to actually see these things and

347
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:57,599
Scott: a lot of straw and a lot of beer cans And it's it is a pretty funny comic that you should

348
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:02,740
Rym: Feel like we could use this in the forum because you know for a long time we had the moderators.

349
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:11,940
Rym: We currently have basically no moderators, but us and one or two people again, but we Would correct the grammar and spelling of the kids in the forum.

350
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:18,957
Rym: Maybe a better way is to have an a lot style comic for every common mistake and just stick it into the post of anyone who fails.

351
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:33,019
Scott: Mmm, the thing is it would be ideal to have the the comic appear as some sort of metadata and not actually in the post Itself true, but that would require you to write some sort of plug-in maybe when vanilla 2 comes out, right?

352
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,589
Rym: Yeah No We're not investing time in writing something for the current.

353
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:39,118
Scott: when vanilla 2 comes out and we switch to it and whatever.

354
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:49,540
Scott: whenever I can Make like a plug-in where a moderator can click and they'll be like a they could there'll be a list of grammatical mistakes And they can click the checkboxes right and basically you'll get the badges will appear on the post.

355
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,591
Rym: Right, that'd be perfect.

356
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:53,943
Scott: And basically they'll be Negative.

357
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:54,485
Scott: see the thing is.

358
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:57,579
Scott: well negative badges work, you know, it's all this whole psychology thing.

359
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:03,211
Rym: Right, maybe someone will collect the bad bad As the problem right is like.

360
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:05,020
Scott: if you want to use the badges negatively.

361
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:05,924
Rym: Well, I wanted one.

362
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:13,022
Rym: one way around it is to have punishments for we're in the meta Moment, by the way, cuz we're talking meta shit about the show It's right.

363
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:21,761
Rym: I'm feeling I want a cat-like typing filter When you are actually typing a post, I don't know I'm gonna.

364
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:25,755
Scott: I'm gonna beta test putting this stupidity filter on there, you know that one.

365
00:24:25,775 --> 00:24:27,120
Rym: Yeah, that one worked pretty well.

366
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,359
Scott: Yeah, it's surprisingly well.

367
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:34,216
Rym: So also meta stuff the book club book right now is still Carl Sagan's cosmos.

368
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:34,798
Scott: Yeah, what do we do?

369
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:35,380
Scott: that episode?

370
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,979
Rym: Well, have you read it yet?

371
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,646
Scott: Maybe I'll add it to this Amazon order.

372
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:39,911
Scott: cuz you don't want to lend me here cop.

373
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:42,100
Rym: cuz I'm reading mine and I'm enjoying.

374
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:45,016
Rym: Book is cuz I haven't been reading it that much.

375
00:24:45,258 --> 00:24:47,285
Scott: No I'm gonna air.

376
00:24:47,326 --> 00:24:48,292
Scott: I'm getting it on Amazon.

377
00:24:48,313 --> 00:24:49,279
Scott: Let me find a cheap coffee.

378
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,860
Rym: I've been reading more and more Java lately because I'm learning to write better Java because I'm basically transitioning and being a freaking developer.

379
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:57,283
Scott: Lucky you.

380
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,774
Rym: I'm not happy but I convinced everyone we're switching to get.

381
00:24:59,794 --> 00:25:00,738
Rym: Mm-hmm.

382
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:01,843
Scott: Oh shit How about that?

383
00:25:01,863 --> 00:25:03,650
Scott: I think it'll learn how to use it.

384
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:05,256
Scott: Do you know how to use it?

385
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,160
Rym: I'm working on it.

386
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,454
Rym: I'm setting up the server and setting up all the procedures and stuff.

387
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,840
Scott: Well, how are you setting up the server?

388
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,541
Rym: Well doses.

389
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:15,369
Rym: It's a Tuesday not Monday.

390
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,853
Rym: We'll talk about this on a Monday.

391
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:18,277
Rym: I think all right.

392
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:19,970
Rym: I Think that's it.

393
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:28,469
Rym: Pax is a long way away, but we'll be there doing panels and if you want to go to Pax West PAX Prime You should buy our badges now.

394
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,234
Rym: They're gonna sell out.

395
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:32,106
Rym: get hotels to Mm-hmm and kinetic.

396
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:32,367
Rym: on.

397
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,497
Rym: if you want to do an awesome gaming panel, we are still accepting submissions.

398
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:36,863
Rym: very soon We're gonna search.

399
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:38,151
Scott: there's not to be a gaming panel.

400
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:39,680
Scott: could be any panel, but it is Tuesday.

401
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:42,540
Rym: So I would assume if you're listening now you want to do a gaming panel.

402
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,860
Rym: We've got a lot of good gaming panels already.

403
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,494
Rym: You would not feel left out or alone if you were doing a gaming panel.

404
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:49,820
Rym: plenty gaming panel friends.

405
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:52,090
Rym: I don't think we have much else.

406
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,120
Scott: That's about it every.

407
00:25:55,223 --> 00:26:00,400
Scott: all the used cosmos copies on frickin Amazon are all hardcover.

408
00:26:01,272 --> 00:26:01,739
Scott: What the hell?

409
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:06,900
Rym: Actually the the soft cover I have right now because I don't know where my original copy went.

410
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:09,880
Rym: I bought at Wildwood for like a dollar.

411
00:26:10,522 --> 00:26:12,790
Scott: You know one new from six bucks fun.

412
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,396
Scott: Okay, anyway, whatever.

413
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:17,425
Rym: Okay, so Might and magic.

414
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:22,158
Rym: we're not going to talk about the might and magic franchise or all the associated cruft.

415
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:23,864
Scott: It's a good series Man, it's all I'm always.

416
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:27,097
Scott: I do want to say though that might magic is one of those gaming franchises.

417
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:27,640
Scott: That's old.

418
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,888
Scott: There's a lot of games in it, right?

419
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,177
Rym: It appeals to a surprising demographic.

420
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,020
Rym: Yeah, what you would expect?

421
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,963
Scott: Oh, it's out there.

422
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:35,447
Scott: people has name recognition.

423
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:37,893
Scott: The thing is it's like, okay.

424
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:40,280
Scott: It's obviously not crazy popular.

425
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:49,171
Scott: It's not like Mario, you know, it's not like I don't know Friggin any Sonic the Hedgehog any.

426
00:26:49,553 --> 00:26:51,120
Scott: it's not, you know Street Fighter, right?

427
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,962
Scott: It's like there are these.

428
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,726
Scott: it's weird how there's these sort of mid to low-end gaming franchises Manage to stick around.

429
00:26:58,766 --> 00:26:59,088
Scott: it's like.

430
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,231
Scott: it's a franchise.

431
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,559
Scott: a lot of games say might magic on them.

432
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:03,704
Rym: They're not.

433
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:09,508
Scott: it's not crazy popular, but it's around and somehow it sticks around Despite not being one.

434
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:12,280
Rym: they were pretty crazy popular during the PC.

435
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,800
Scott: Yeah for a very short time.

436
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,694
Scott: But think about the number of people who played them in those olden days.

437
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:18,040
Scott: not a large number at all.

438
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:50,280
Rym: But I think what it is more is that I believe the demographic of a lot of the might and magic games skews a lot more to road toward girls surprisingly and at least in my experience, but also toward people who are Either almost off the radar on gaming like they're not online and vocal about their gaming but they play might magic and they like these games and the other types of people who play it a lot are the people who even if they're on the radar are not the people who Go to gaming websites and participate in like the online gaming culture.

439
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,920
Scott: Do you think there's a whole bunch of might and magic?

440
00:27:52,180 --> 00:28:01,060
Rym: Players out there who just aren't talking because they just sort of sit home play So or in the very least they talk to each other And they go to those like might magic fan sites, which they're surprising.

441
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:07,280
Rym: I'm sure there's probably plenty of this but we're talking about one recent might and magic game clash of heroes on the DS.

442
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,231
Scott: Yeah, it's not heroes of might and magic.

443
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:14,231
Scott: It's might and magic clash of heroes And it is not heroes of might and magic because that would be silly.

444
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:14,933
Rym: Yes.

445
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:17,120
Scott: Here's a mighty magic clash of heroes.

446
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:19,069
Rym: Yeah, you know, I kind of wish it was named that now.

447
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:20,596
Scott: It's yet this.

448
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:21,380
Rym: it's basically.

449
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:26,536
Rym: There is technically an RPG in here, but no not really.

450
00:28:26,556 --> 00:28:27,700
Rym: it is tacked on.

451
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:30,880
Scott: It has an RPG like Advance Wars has an RPG?

452
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,121
Scott: No,

453
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:37,880
Rym: no, no, Advance Wars was an engaging thorough story compared to might and magic clash of heroes

454
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:46,355
Scott: Like the part where you walk around the map at least in Advance Wars is just a map and you click on the next dot and then you fight and clash of heroes.

455
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:48,999
Scott: at least you do A little bit of stuff on the map.

456
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,241
Scott: but

457
00:28:49,381 --> 00:29:02,640
Rym: there's a guy with a purple bandana who says I sure like my purple bandana and right next to him is a guy who Says I will pay you a whole bunch of money if you find a guy with a purple bandana and kill his ass Yeah, and then you go back to the guy with the purple bandana.

458
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,119
Scott: That's a lot more than Advance Wars, which says click on the next city to fight.

459
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:11,317
Rym: But Advance Wars you had the romance between the characters least in the old games romance in this.

460
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:15,496
Scott: Yeah Yeah between night guy and woodsy girl.

461
00:29:15,597 --> 00:29:17,367
Rym: Oh fuck that You know where the best romances.

462
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:22,488
Rym: so far you haven't gotten it to this part But in the demon level you meet this succubus who won is totally hot.

463
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:29,707
Rym: Oh shit hot like actually totally hot both literally and figuratively And she basically joins her party.

464
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,340
Rym: she's kind of a bitch but whatever but there's definitely sexual tension there.

465
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:41,120
Rym: But it is so tacked on it is so flimsy, but it's just an excuse to play a puzzle game with a theme.

466
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:43,568
Scott: Yeah, I was kind of really surprised.

467
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:47,000
Scott: every might and magic game I've ever played right including Kings bounty, right?

468
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,595
Scott: Which is also people don't realize this, you know is a is my magic game right?

469
00:29:51,957 --> 00:30:00,540
Scott: sort of secretly is The way they work generally is you walk around a map and you're sort of doing this town castle management kind of thing.

470
00:30:01,043 --> 00:30:12,738
Scott: But you're also sort of managing this army and then you're also when you get into a fight there's a little there's like a tiny hex map and you move your units around and Fight and that's what it might imagine game is all about.

471
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:17,440
Scott: But this game has basically nothing to do with those at all whatsoever.

472
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:26,839
Scott: I can't even find any connection at all period except for the fact that as you walk around You can purchase units at certain stops and that's it.

473
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,639
Scott: And in no other way does it even resemble might magic any any other might imagine game I've ever seen.

474
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:46,139
Rym: now The thing is despite the theme Basically having nothing to do with the game whatsoever Yeah, I mean it makes so little sense and it even breaks down internally when you try to figure out like what's actually going on with the plot.

475
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,851
Rym: and How come you fight everyone you talk to with an army?

476
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,420
Scott: You don't fight everyone you talk almost everyone.

477
00:30:54,332 --> 00:31:03,207
Rym: Okay Just the logistics of this do not make any sense, but had it just been the puzzle game It wouldn't have been as fun.

478
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:17,529
Rym: They did the theme for somehow it adds something to the game surprisingly and it basically just tricks you into Playing a series of puzzles that are kind of match up the colors with a little mechanic of making a little wall Different factions to do different things.

479
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:20,220
Scott: I think the puzzle game on its own would have been just as fun.

480
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,077
Scott: The thing is you the part of the you need to keep the theme on the puzzles, right?

481
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:36,403
Scott: Because the puzzles it's like you look at say magical drop, but it's a very similar puzzle game to this right and You know, it's got the same sort of action pull off the bottom and push back up right up match up three colors in a row To act to.

482
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:41,700
Scott: you know score but the this the combat and this has a theme like you choose different units.

483
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:55,447
Scott: they got swordsmen and spearmen you got big Knights and angels and Demons and all sorts of skeletons and all that sort of stuff and they actually attack and do damage and you build walls and You have different items and different powers.

484
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:56,752
Scott: So it's like they.

485
00:31:57,154 --> 00:31:58,499
Scott: it's sort of like puzzle quest, right?

486
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,559
Scott: Puzzle quest was sort of like the first in this.

487
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:10,220
Scott: Okay, we have a puzzle game But we've also got sort of an RPG combat thing attached to what's basically Tetris or bejeweled or whatnot, right?

488
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,220
Scott: So this sort of takes it a step further.

489
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:17,860
Scott: It makes a better puzzle game and instead, you know puzzle quest the RPG part was sort of external, right?

490
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,820
Scott: You'd play bejeweled to get mana to play magical gathering in puzzle quest.

491
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:23,988
Scott: But in this you are.

492
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:29,106
Scott: the puzzle is the RPG Combat II part at the same time.

493
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:29,828
Scott: It's merged.

494
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:30,188
Scott: It's not.

495
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:34,460
Scott: it's not like they tacked on this combat to a puzzle to magical drop.

496
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,607
Scott: It's magical drop of fantasy.

497
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:40,099
Scott: It is the magical drop is the fantasy combat together.

498
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,280
Rym: now I think for people like us it wouldn't matter that much.

499
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:54,615
Rym: I mean look it's a game that we still love to this day is Battle balls where the theme is just pictures in the background and you're fighting with balls or cod crap to Sakura Tetris One of the best Tetris is except for I guess DS Tetris is better.

500
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:57,553
Rym: Yeah, probably Yeah, but we like that stuff.

501
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:07,217
Rym: people like us will play The versus puzzle game in any context if the versus puzzle game is good Especially if it's direct versus like doing damage to someone.

502
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:12,240
Rym: Yep But the theme of this game kind of adds a much more universal appeal.

503
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:17,500
Rym: But I think it really just serves the same purpose as the character you pick in the background of battle balls.

504
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,060
Rym: That has no effect on the game whatsoever.

505
00:33:19,803 --> 00:33:27,419
Rym: It just adds this kind of element and also because of the different factions are different You know the skeletons or the elves or whatever and they're really different too.

506
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:31,395
Rym: It adds a huge kind of paper rock scissors or in the very least.

507
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:33,026
Scott: It's not a paper rock scissors I think it's just.

508
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:36,140
Scott: you have to play differently Not necessarily.

509
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:39,816
Rym: I'm pretty sure that certain factions can just kick the shit out of certain other factions.

510
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:40,398
Rym: you think so.

511
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:47,880
Scott: cuz I Get the feeling that every faction is sort of equal, you know I mean your units might not be leveled up or you might choose the wrong units.

512
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,249
Rym: You know versus everything's leveled up all the way.

513
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:51,032
Scott: That's the only part.

514
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:51,213
Scott: that's.

515
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:52,940
Rym: it's definitely what makes this game.

516
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:53,984
Rym: Is that the RPG?

517
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:54,326
Rym: whatever?

518
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:57,880
Rym: it's kind of fun leveling your guys up and whatever cuz you don't really have to grind.

519
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:02,300
Rym: But when you play versus it just gives you everyone all maxed out.

520
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:08,199
Rym: Everyone's maxed up level up all the way and then you both pick an artifact Yeah, and everyone has access to every artifact.

521
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:12,900
Rym: The only unlocking in the game at all is you have to beat the that part of the game of a given character.

522
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,565
Scott: maybe didn't beat the necromancy level.

523
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:19,478
Scott: then you can't use necromancy stuff like skeletons and wraiths and whatever in the.

524
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:22,248
Scott: You know the verses which is fine.

525
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,139
Scott: You know, that's I've seen a lot worse unlocking than that.

526
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:36,233
Rym: The only thing that really bothers me is that I kind of wish there were more things to do in the versus mode Like it's one situation where they made the versus mode great.

527
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:37,820
Rym: It's just a direct straight-up competition.

528
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,433
Rym: They didn't do anything stupid like Pokemon games tend to do.

529
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:44,346
Rym: it was exactly what I wanted But as a result, I just want more.

530
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:47,996
Rym: I want like 2v2 maybe some team fights.

531
00:34:48,397 --> 00:34:49,540
Rym: I want different battle modes.

532
00:34:50,663 --> 00:34:53,600
Scott: I think it would be cool if there was like some sort of mode, you know.

533
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,280
Scott: If you could like just give me allow me to modify the rules a little bit.

534
00:34:57,481 --> 00:35:05,173
Scott: You know like tweak the number of guys that get sent in or yeah Cuz maybe I want to play a versus with two really low-level guys.

535
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,500
Rym: Yeah, you can't do that.

536
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:07,564
Scott: Yeah stuff like that.

537
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:13,505
Scott: I don't know or like, you know versus no big guys, you know Just like be like no big guy mode.

538
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:14,247
Scott: That'd be cool.

539
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:14,869
Rym: Now.

540
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:18,500
Rym: I still haven't actually played this game much with humans.

541
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:20,138
Scott: I played it once.

542
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:21,123
Scott: Versus against.

543
00:35:21,284 --> 00:35:23,894
Scott: Alex are waiting for our food in a fancy restaurant and you know what that.

544
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:26,740
Scott: for the one time we played it It was crazy epic.

545
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:27,362
Scott: Like.

546
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:30,713
Scott: I come out like I played this a lot more than Alex has cuz.

547
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:36,518
Scott: I played it for you know weeks and he only Played it like, you know since he bought it which is after I told him about it because you didn't buy it, right?

548
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,025
Scott: Maybe I should.

549
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:40,440
Scott: I'm gonna buy it for the Xbox instead of the anyway.

550
00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:45,840
Scott: So I come out with this huge devastating combo and bring his health halfway down.

551
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,920
Scott: He's like, oh shit and then we keep playing and he starts whittling me and whittling and whittling and I can't really mounting strong defense.

552
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:54,712
Scott: And he's got a big guy charging up and I don't have an.

553
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:59,179
Scott: I use my big guy right away I don't have another one coming in and it's not looking too good.

554
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,394
Scott: And we're basically at the point where he's got stuff charged up.

555
00:36:02,776 --> 00:36:09,320
Scott: as soon as it lets loose I'm dead right and I've basically just I was like, oh I lost it's over.

556
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,975
Scott: But I charged up the only guy I had on the screen and yeah, I just went out.

557
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:14,019
Scott: whatever I can't win.

558
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,622
Scott: Then my one guy Frickin.

559
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:22,820
Scott: he activated on the turn right before and I didn't think he was gonna do enough damage to win.

560
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:23,698
Scott: So I had wrote him off.

561
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:31,871
Scott: He busted through a tiny broken wall and a couple units and he had exactly enough life left to do the eight damage Necessary for me to win.

562
00:36:32,073 --> 00:36:37,500
Scott: exactly enough You know damage and he was down to zero and I won and I would have lost in the next turn.

563
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,931
Scott: So that is a friggin balanced awesome multiplayer right there.

564
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:43,660
Rym: I want to play a lot more of this game online with people.

565
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,648
Rym: I just want to fight actual humans.

566
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:45,969
Scott: I don't know.

567
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:47,394
Scott: Does it the DS play online?

568
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,940
Rym: I don't even look at them.

569
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,312
Scott: I know the Xbox will play online in the very least.

570
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:52,780
Rym: I'll play with people at the next packs.

571
00:36:53,269 --> 00:37:00,684
Rym: Oh for sure These people better have this game to play because the single car you can play it seems to only let you play nights Mmm and nights.

572
00:37:00,745 --> 00:37:01,146
Rym: I don't like.

573
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,572
Rym: I personally like the nights.

574
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:04,420
Rym: I like being the elves or the undead.

575
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:08,680
Scott: So I kind of like the big guys on the nights like the angel and the giant armored dude.

576
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:11,193
Rym: Yeah, but that's skeleton night in the.

577
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,560
Scott: he's pretty dangerous.

578
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,365
Scott: The thing is I like with the spider cloak.

579
00:37:14,385 --> 00:37:16,010
Rym: He'll do like 190 damage.

580
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,660
Scott: Yeah, the thing is in terms of walls, right?

581
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,560
Scott: I like either the skeletons or the elves because the skeletons they have the walls that sort of build up when the skeletons get crushed.

582
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:29,840
Scott: But the elves actually I think of the slightly better walls because they just rebuild themselves.

583
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,900
Scott: So you can build like a tiny wall and you don't have to keep stacking it.

584
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,456
Scott: It'll just sort of grow on its own.

585
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:44,440
Rym: But at the same time the stacking is usually because the you can do some pretty amazing combos in this game despite the limitations Though I do wish there was a way to play with a slightly deeper and wider field.

586
00:37:45,361 --> 00:38:00,658
Scott: Yeah, I think the thing is is like when they've designed the game they built it like exactly Definitely because it's like okay if you build any walls at all We're not going to give you have only five spaces, which means you can't build, you know, the six tall You know double fusion behind it, right?

587
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:08,847
Scott: You can only do that on an empty row and they you know We only gonna give you this many wide so that you can't just you know It's not a multiple of threes.

588
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:17,608
Scott: that way you can't just build a wall straight across perfectly You know, you're gonna have some funkiness going on there and that forces you to you know Manipulate your units cleverly and such and such.

589
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,920
Scott: so they balance it to the perfect height and width for the rule set they had.

590
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,820
Scott: But if they allowed you to go bigger and wider it could get pretty interesting.

591
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:29,900
Scott: But I think it also might not scale well because it would just be like it would just be more.

592
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,045
Scott: It's like oh, well great.

593
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:31,225
Scott: Now.

594
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:32,310
Scott: I basically it's like playing.

595
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:40,200
Rym: you might as well just play three games at once that are separate A little bit but it'd be interesting to play a similar game on a slightly larger scale.

596
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:44,940
Scott: I mean like would Tetris be any better if you made it taller and wider unless you also made it different.

597
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:52,679
Rym: That's exactly what I'm saying a slightly different game just with the slightly larger more zoomed out scale to it But otherwise similar in the way that you go about it.

598
00:38:52,860 --> 00:39:01,672
Rym: Hmm, it's definitely it shows the triumph of a game that has a very small number of rules But yet has emergent strategy.

599
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:07,680
Rym: just by the interaction of those rules I mean get three guys in a row vertically and they start charging their laser.

600
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:16,634
Rym: Yet another three guys Vertically that will finish charging at the same time and are the same color as someone else already charging and they link up and they both Do more damage together.

601
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:22,260
Rym: Mm-hmm If you make a guy of the same color and type behind a guy who's already charging his laser double laser

602
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:25,830
Scott: Yep, you can even get like triple laser quadruple laser and

603
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:31,399
Rym: every big guy and most of the little guys have some weird special power But they're still very they're deterministic.

604
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:37,280
Rym: They're things like this guy does X more damage under y situation or this guy doesn't take damage when defending.

605
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,240
Scott: Yep, this is also, you know get three guys wide and they make a wall.

606
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:42,834
Scott: but what if you get?

607
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:49,140
Scott: you know You got three guys wide and you delete a unit and now you got three guys wide and three guys tall at the same time.

608
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,130
Scott: You basically get a wall and a charged laser.

609
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:52,880
Scott: you like get extra stuff for doing that.

610
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,739
Scott: Yep, you also get like extra turns because they only give you three actions per turn.

611
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:02,080
Scott: But if you delete guys and your deletion makes things happen, then you get extra moves.

612
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:07,380
Scott: So like you delete a guy that makes a wall it charges two lasers, but with that one deletion.

613
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:08,446
Scott: Well, guess what?

614
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,075
Scott: now you've got like three extra actions.

615
00:40:10,135 --> 00:40:14,863
Scott: with those extra actions You could bring in extra units and build two more lasers and you know You can get.

616
00:40:14,904 --> 00:40:18,003
Scott: you really get the machine rolling that way Pretty good.

617
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:19,167
Rym: It's just.

618
00:40:19,227 --> 00:40:28,209
Rym: it's a solid game and I'd recommend, you know, anyone who's in this DS drought right now This game is pretty much up anyone's alley, you know, I think the DS I don't know if it's in like the biggest drought.

619
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:31,160
Scott: It is a slight drought compared to where the DS was before.

620
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:33,568
Scott: But you know the DS really is.

621
00:40:33,628 --> 00:40:36,156
Scott: it's like the sleeping giant, you know, it's always there.

622
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:38,322
Scott: people don't talk about it too much But it's freaking.

623
00:40:38,342 --> 00:40:39,686
Scott: everyone's got one.

624
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:47,991
Scott: It's got piles of awesome game like babies fashion like babies fashion You know and I think because people don't pay attention to it pretty much.

625
00:40:48,252 --> 00:40:55,855
Scott: if someone does make a really great DS game That isn't like, you know Nintendo pretty much anyone but Nintendo makes an awesome DS game.

626
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:57,299
Scott: No one will know about it.

627
00:40:57,742 --> 00:40:58,929
Scott: It'll be completely mystery.

628
00:40:59,352 --> 00:41:00,620
Scott: What like this game was.

629
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:04,434
Scott: But then as soon as people discover it, it's like holy shit.

630
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:10,460
Scott: There's an awesome DS game We didn't know about discovered, you know, hidden grail and that's exactly what clash of heroes is.

631
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,628
Rym: I have to take a moment though.

632
00:41:11,668 --> 00:41:18,934
Rym: The the tacked out RPG is Dangerously cheesy like there's some fucking dialogue.

633
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:20,660
Scott: It's just a generic RPG.

634
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,440
Scott: You know how many DS games have like just generic fantasy RPG attached to them?

635
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:33,307
Rym: but the the reason it feels so tacked on primarily is that you move around by moving between These dotted nodes and they'll be like a guys.

636
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:39,166
Rym: It looks a lot like that fight that bastardized Final Fantasy mystic quest Uh-huh.

637
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:40,679
Rym: It looks a lot like that.

638
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:47,273
Scott: There's you know, I've played a lot of DS games that are sort of you know Generic fantasy RPG and this is pretty much the same as all the others.

639
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:48,638
Scott: at least this one is a little bit better.

640
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:50,303
Rym: arts and Yeah, the arts good.

641
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:51,367
Rym: No, I think about the music.

642
00:41:51,387 --> 00:41:55,700
Rym: The music sounds really good, but it sounds almost exactly like the music in Wesnoth.

643
00:41:56,762 --> 00:42:01,647
Scott: Yeah, it's like when I started playing the game, you know You know, I was like, huh?

644
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:02,852
Scott: Where is the?

645
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:04,520
Scott: you know this music?

646
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,572
Scott: I've heard it before somewhere and I was like, you know at first I'm like.

647
00:42:07,613 --> 00:42:13,700
Scott: this seems to sound exactly Like a lot of other music from you know, DS fantasy games, you know.

648
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,360
Scott: It just sort of felt like that even though I couldn't figure out exactly which game.

649
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:19,899
Scott: But then as soon as someone said Wesnoth, I'm like, huh?

650
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,478
Scott: Yeah, this you know.

651
00:42:21,881 --> 00:42:32,259
Scott: I don't know if it's DS games in general or Wesnoth in this game or what but it is a style of music That just seems to be the music used in these fantasy games And I don't know what's up with it.

652
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:41,278
Scott: But it's sort of weird because it's not great like I wouldn't put on my iPod But it's catchy and you sort of remember it in this weird way and it's also sort of fitting.

653
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:41,700
Scott: I don't know.

654
00:42:42,942 --> 00:42:44,858
Scott: But yeah, it's it's fantasy musics.

655
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:54,170
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
