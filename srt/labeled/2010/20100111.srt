1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,626
Rym: Hey, it's Monday January 11th.

2
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:12,489
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:17,360
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight our CES commentary roundup.

4
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:36,110
Scott: So Rym I see you Haven't put your pants on since what yesterday.

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,375
Rym: Yeah, they're pretty much off.

7
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:38,880
Rym: I had to put them on for work.

8
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:40,771
Scott: Did you like not do any laundry?

9
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:42,180
Scott: Oh you did put pants on for work.

10
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:43,960
Rym: I figured for work.

11
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:53,799
Rym: I should put pants on because No one at my office would have had any idea about this except for the fact that one guy was like Yeah, there are all these people on the subway yesterday, and they just didn't have any pants on.

12
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:57,318
Rym: And I was like I was one of those people.

13
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,006
Rym: What was going on?

14
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:00,633
Rym: and I was like well, I just forgot my pants.

15
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:02,119
Rym: I don't know what was up with all those assholes.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,009
Scott: Yeah, actually on the stop right before Union Square yesterday.

17
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:16,639
Scott: You know I also happen to forget my pants just randomly, but like The the co-worker that I work with the most just happened to get on the same exact subway car that I was on.

18
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:28,380
Rym: So my thing of the day from our triumphant return was of course the improv everywhere International no pants day on Sunday, which as we said we participated in myself Scott Emily Judith and Natalie.

19
00:01:28,762 --> 00:01:31,759
Scott: I think though it's gonna be a problem because like too many people know what's up.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,422
Scott: You know this.

21
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:40,788
Scott: it's hard to freak squares when like they saw it on the news this morning or something You know and people just come up and ask you like so you guys You stand on this train into Union Square.

22
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:41,531
Scott: You're gonna transfer.

23
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:42,816
Scott: It's like you know.

24
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:43,700
Scott: There's no more.

25
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:45,105
Scott: I forgot my pants.

26
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:54,738
Rym: the trouble with that is that you still get people because remember for all the people that are hip in the City there are twice as many people who don't say anything, and there's looking at you like what the

27
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,832
Scott: fuck It's true, but but it's

28
00:01:57,872 --> 00:02:04,040
Rym: generally a hip and techie city So it's difficult to get away with any sort of large public flash mob.

29
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:10,180
Rym: That's why the true great flash mobs of improv everywhere are the private ones like let's go to Best Buy.

30
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:11,431
Scott: Yeah, it's a good one.

31
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:12,480
Rym: That's still my favorite one.

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,819
Scott: Well, just keep an eye on their website because I'm sure they do lots of New York action that we can be involved in.

33
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,829
Rym: Yeah, but no pants was very near and dear to me.

34
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,443
Rym: I mean we have our own custom no pants card and nanofictionary Mmm.

35
00:02:24,684 --> 00:02:25,509
Rym: I should have brought that.

36
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,099
Scott: oh yeah, right the no pants guy.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,023
Rym: I didn't even think to.

38
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:30,553
Rym: we should have played some nanofictionary, but it's funny.

39
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:30,915
Rym: How you know.

40
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:34,100
Rym: they separate us into groups and It's always great.

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:46,829
Rym: It's very rare for Scott and I to be members of the following crowd as opposed to the people organizing it like a con or An event like this mm-hmm, and it was cool to be in the audience of a group of people organized by someone Who is very competent at crowd control?

42
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,270
Rym: Yeah?

43
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:48,516
Rym: I mean he got everyone together.

44
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:49,520
Rym: He did all the right things.

45
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:50,599
Scott: It was so cool out.

46
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,927
Scott: It's like all they had to organize this thing.

47
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:59,577
Scott: it was basically one website and like ten generals with with Megaphones that was all they did to organize.

48
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:01,224
Scott: like Thousands of people

49
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:12,772
Rym: he walked around and he saw people who obviously had done this before and knew what was up And he made them like team captains gave them all a number and in a stroke of brilliance that I never thought of and I Plan to use this at every freaking anytime.

50
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,460
Rym: I need to divide a crowd up, and it's large.

51
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:20,140
Rym: He asked everyone to go to the number of the group that matches the last digit of their cell phone number.

52
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:29,354
Rym: Yep, it was brilliant, so we all split up and in my group only works if you're dividing people up into ten groups Yeah, or you know if your number is even or odd.

53
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:30,258
Rym: there's all sorts of ways.

54
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,677
Scott: yeah I'm just saying it's you know.

55
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,633
Rym: But I go to my group and the team lead there is like.

56
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:38,596
Rym: so I need a volunteer to Basically go first and be the odd man out.

57
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:43,540
Scott: I'm like yo Yep, and then I go actually originally scheduled to go second.

58
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:48,736
Scott: But the guy who was gonna go first was he wanted to stay with his girlfriend or whatever.

59
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:49,378
Scott: so that I was.

60
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:50,922
Scott: I was promoted To going first.

61
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,213
Rym: I basically got on the train and looked around and there were.

62
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:58,976
Rym: there were a bunch of normies on my car When our group got on yeah surprisingly crowded for a weekend train.

63
00:03:59,178 --> 00:03:59,600
Rym: It was great.

64
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:02,760
Rym: I sit down I look around and I just say oh shit.

65
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,788
Rym: And then I just take my pants off and put him in my bag and sit back down.

66
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,839
Rym: like there we go And people just kind of look at me.

67
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:17,740
Rym: I had a line so set but no one asked me when I was taking my pants off Why I was taking my pants off because I had this surreal stroke of genius.

68
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,785
Rym: I wanted to say if anyone asked me.

69
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:20,507
Rym: Oh, well.

70
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:25,950
Rym: I just forgot I was wearing him Like Stephen Wright must have come to me from the grave.

71
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:31,476
Scott: So I just got on the train and it was so quick into the next stop that I had to hurry up to take Them off quickly enough.

72
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,964
Scott: you know I get was mostly getting the shoes off Getting the pants off getting the shoes back on getting the pants in the bag.

73
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:38,350
Scott: It was it was difficult operation.

74
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:41,510
Rym: It was great standing at that next stop because that we were the ones who got to stand.

75
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:45,409
Scott: Yeah, so me and ram are standing like 20 feet away from each other on this subway platform.

76
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,300
Rym: That's real nonchalant like he's standing there like just a commuter guy.

77
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:51,050
Rym: I'm standing there playing my DS kind of spread eagle.

78
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:52,895
Scott: It was cold.

79
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:54,581
Rym: It was fucking cold.

80
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,710
Rym: Good guy really cold, but it was great.

81
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:06,810
Rym: I one by one like normal people would walk up and their little conversation would be going along and they kind of just Like stop talking for a minute and look around Giggle or something and then just try to avoid all of us.

82
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,995
Rym: But they couldn't because there was one of us like every 20 feet Mmm.

83
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:12,810
Scott: Yeah, the thing was is like at the next stop.

84
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,505
Scott: No one got on my car even though it was the same exact car that I got off of.

85
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:19,464
Scott: so I was like uh-oh Did we mess up this or something?

86
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:19,847
Scott: and then?

87
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:23,130
Scott: You know eventually people did get out of my car.

88
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,517
Scott: I was not like left alone.

89
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:26,950
Rym: my car had a few extra pencils people yeah.

90
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,717
Scott: And then was awesome is like Times Square because we only had people going down to Queensborough Boulevard And that was our entire group.

00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:37,477
Scott: It's like perfectly timed.

93
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:43,721
Scott: all these other people who I assume must have been on like the seven train Transferred onto our train from the seven.

94
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:46,150
Scott: so it was like ah look at all these people just joined us.

Scott: Awesome.

96
00:05:48,651 --> 00:06:00,223
Rym: But one of my favorite moments was I got to the place you know Union Square And I went over to the Starbucks And there was like one guy in there other than me with no pants on and no one really noticed him except for a few People are kind of staring at him like that guy's no pants.

97
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:00,746
Rym: What's he fine?

98
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:01,370

Scott: Yeah, I just I worry about the future.

139
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:36,381
Rym: if too many people You know no pants will no longer be a freak the squares.

140
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,410
Rym: It'll just be like a national holiday.

141
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,620
Scott: Yeah, I think we need to mix it up a little bit.

142
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:45,244
Scott: It needs to be no shirt Just underwear only.

143
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,677
Rym: I'd rather wait until at least March.

144
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,487
Scott: We should also move it to a non cold time of year.

145
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:53,310
Scott: You know it's the point.

146
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:56,028
Scott: No, you know it's not fair right to Sydney right?

147
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:59,890
Scott: Sydney Did it at the same day which means it was really nice and warm there?

148
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:02,209
Scott: They should have to move there six months over.

149
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,092
Rym: Yeah They should.

150
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:08,962
Scott: or maybe what we could do is in compromise make it twice a year six months I think so everyone gets both sticks.

151
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,375
Rym: It's not so bad You know what the people in like.

152
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:12,139
Scott: you know Florida.

153
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:13,223
Scott: They never have a problem.

154
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,538
Scott: They're like yeah, it's Jamaica No pants day.

155
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,770
Scott: what they have pants in Jamaica.

156
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:18,557
Rym: It's not so fans.

157
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:18,818
Scott: ever.

158
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:21,930
Rym: if I was in Jamaica bad except for the fact that we were on the end.

159
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,144
Rym: So we had to stand on the platform.

160
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:25,110
Rym: That's above ground.

161
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:33,188
Scott: Started with like the Williamsburg people we could have taken the L And it would have basically been like yeah, we're underground the whole time.

162
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:33,650
Scott: big deal.

163
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:40,940
Rym: I gotta say though it was funny that the crowd of people who showed up to do this Was very reminiscent of the crowd that showed up at PAX West.

164
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,707
Scott: all people our age who are cool and hip.

165
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,890
Rym: I mean We are no old people no kids our group.

166
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,370
Rym: We were all arguing about homeopathy and all that stuff and then these two cute cool girls come over.

167
00:08:51,450 --> 00:09:00,530
Rym: They're like hey, yeah, yeah, we heard conversation, and that's something that's kind of up our alley My name is blah, and we hung out and then this guy and this girl with two ferrets came over.

168
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,223
Scott: Yeah ferrets did the ferrets take the pants off?

169
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:05,310
Rym: uh?

170
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,952
Rym: I don't know.

171
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:10,263
Rym: I've never seen a ferret wear pants But maybe the fur counts in which case I don't want to see them.

172
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,631
Rym: take that off mmm Cuz.

173
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,039
Rym: there's kind of scraggly and wrinkly.

174
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:14,386
Scott: go look on you.

175
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:21,070
Scott: go on the internet We got to search for like hairless ferret always got to search for ferret and pants or hairless mongoose or something.

176
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,769
Rym: At least we didn't miss the fancy pants parade.

177
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:32,670
Rym: That song was stuck in my head for most of the event as was that Seinfeld episode with naked guy on the subway anyway.

178
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:38,650
Scott: so This show that we're gonna do today is mostly about CES the consumer electronic show.

179
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,655
Scott: But I want to talk about.

180
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:42,930
Scott: is that Leo Laporte you know from the twit network?

181
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:44,718
Scott: They did a big thing at CES.

182
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:44,919
Scott: you know.

183
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:48,756
Scott: he would always talk about how you shouldn't go because you can just read it All in a gadget, and there's no reason to go.

184
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:51,489
Scott: yep, but he got sponsors that sent him there, so he went.

185
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:56,137
Scott: and You know I was one day I was watching him live just to you know.

186
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:03,623
Scott: see what he was doing at the CES and apparently he had the biggest number of Like live viewers he ever had ever during that time that I was watching.

187
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,048
Scott: so something about it was.

188
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,138
Scott: I think it was cuz it was Friday he was at.

189
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:07,801
Scott: it was CES.

190
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:08,545
Scott: There's a big event.

191
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:27,330
Scott: He was live there I you know and I was watching him operate and I realized The only difference between us and him at this point right is a. he has a professional radio voice because he's a professional radio guy Right - he has sponsors and money to buy better equipment.

192
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,409
Scott: now He doesn't buy super professional equipment like TV networks, but he has more equipment than we do.

193
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:34,155
Rym: you know He's basically one step up from us.

194
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:37,065
Scott: if I can buy multiple HD cameras.

195
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:40,240
Scott: He can buy better microphones He can buy a caster.

196
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,552
Scott: He could buy any number of computers He needs.

197
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:42,773
Scott: right.

198
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:46,044
Scott: he can buy wireless cards to get on evdo networks or whatever.

199
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:46,325
Scott: you know.

200
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,194
Scott: he could buy one cell phone from every Network.

201
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:52,121
Scott: he's right yeah, and He has enough money to hire people to help him.

202
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:58,921
Scott: other than that like watching him operate I was like oh my god It's just like when I had to run the panel all day at Connecticut.

203
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:02,049
Scott: only he's running a podcast all day at CES.

204
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:08,370
Scott: Oh God, I just I felt like I was at Connecticut again like he was talking about how the Convention Center is so dry.

205
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:13,694
Scott: Hey, my throat is dried out, and you know I was like ah It was like I was.

206
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:16,767
Scott: I was taken back right into Connecticut.

207
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:17,430
Rym: Oh my god.

208
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:29,870
Scott: So just knowing that he was doing going through that and he was doing basically the same thing I was like yeah, I can do everything he can do except have professional radio voice and have more monies.

209
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:40,909
Scott: so If anyone wants to give us more monies and maybe give us some radio voice training We can put on a Leo Laporte show for you, please sponsor us.

210
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:43,900
Scott: We can put on a show just as good as he can.

211
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:45,346
Scott: we've done it before.

212
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:46,330
Scott: we can do it again.

213
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:47,914
Scott: Call me.

214
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:48,782
Rym: I don't know.

215
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:51,636
Rym: at the same time Think back to all those cons.

216
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:54,550
Rym: It's real fun, and we like doing this, but it sucks.

217
00:11:55,557 --> 00:12:02,218
Scott: But if you get paid big money yeah, imagine if someone are you understand like what his sponsor is paid for.

218
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:08,844
Scott: they bought him a a Broadcasting platform right because there's all these broadcast platforms you can buy.

219
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:11,797
Scott: you know like when you're at New York comic-con There's like up on the site right.

220
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,990
Scott: so they paid for him to get a broadcast platform.

221
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:17,160
Scott: They had a t1 sent to the broadcast platform right.

222
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:20,410
Scott: so already that's so worth what right they paid for it.

223
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,780
Scott: I have like these banners hung up.

224
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,868
Scott: that was like to it at CES.

225
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,310
Scott: They paid for you know advertising and all the programs it paid.

226
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:28,414
Scott: Oh, they paid for it.

227
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:32,410
Scott: They gave him a car to drive their plane tickets in first class.

228
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,641
Scott: Well what I was thinking is to get the equipment there.

229
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,630
Rym: We wreck ourselves at conventions anyway.

230
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:48,253
Scott: So if someone paid me to wreck myself at a convention That's great, and they paid for the staff and the food and the went to parties and yeah, and hey We're going to PAX.

231
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:55,690
Scott: if anyone would like to sponsor GeekNights at PAX East slash West give us a broadcasting platform inside the email.

232
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:05,829
Rym: Remind all of you will be doing a ton of panels at PAX East and if you have not pre-registered for PAX East yet Do it today.

233
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:08,343
Rym: They're going to sell out I guarantee you.

234
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:12,741
Rym: and for the talk about this tomorrow Yeah But I you know tech people is that you should go to PAX East to.

235
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:14,388
Rym: the hotels are almost all sold out.

236
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:16,907
Rym: get your hotel Right now or you're not gonna go to PAX East.

237
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:24,290
Scott: yes There is a good chance that more than ten percent of the PAX East panels will be by us or associates.

238
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:36,086
Rym: Oh, yeah, well the good chance is pretty much a hundred percent But it might be as high as sixteen percent depending on what we find what the final contract is yeah It also depends on a lot of other factors that may or may not change.

239
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:37,212
Scott: so yep We'll see.

240
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:40,070
Rym: oh my god, but I do want to talk a little bit.

241
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:54,529
Rym: There is a story about CES vendors being kicked out of their hotel rooms around Vegas during CES and supposedly what they were doing in the hotel rooms was Demoing products and and basically doing what they would have done on the floor of CES.

242
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:56,383
Scott: They've always done this in their hotel room.

243
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:56,665
Scott: this

244
00:13:56,705 --> 00:14:13,334
Rym: all happens a lot I know, but the point is a whole bunch of hotels according to this report Kicked them out of their hotel rooms even the large like business suites and everything For on the grounds that they were using the rooms for this and no one can really figure out What the deal was.

245
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:20,268
Rym: and people are speculating that maybe CES was going after the people who were doing this But not actually paying for space at CES.

246
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:23,790
Scott: Well first of all I think the space at CES was sold out.

247
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,529
Scott: I can't confirm that but um you know when you look at it They have multiple halls, and they're all full right.

248
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,763
Scott: Secondly it is a common occurrence.

249
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,290
Scott: This has been going on for a very long time.

250
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:41,330
Rym: This is a normal tech conference thing like yes, even like tech conferences I've been to there's like hotel room suite parties and hotel room demonstrations.

251
00:14:41,551 --> 00:15:06,770
Scott: Also, it's completely normal and not out of the ordinary whatsoever for what usually happens is if you have a really niche Sort of area of consumer electronics or whatever what happens is like oh yes consumer electronics shows in the convention center But actually some guy rented out the ballroom at the Sheraton and all like the audio file Companies are in there like this audio at CES, but all the audio file stuff is at the Sheraton.

252
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:09,799
Scott: There's nothing to do with CES It's just they cuz CES.

253
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:17,009
Scott: at the same time this niche Sets up in a hotel ballroom and pretty much every hotel ballroom is set up with some niche of CES.

254
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:24,303
Scott: You know something that really wouldn't justify Getting tables at the big show But people who are into that will know to go to the hotel ballroom.

255
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:25,849
Rym: people are reporting to that.

256
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:33,507
Rym: Apparently all the vendors who were doing this who had rented floor space at CES had no problem.

257
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:44,269
Rym: Oh Really yeah, I've seen multiple reports of that and this I mean I can't say I don't know, but it does reek of some sort of agreement between the hotels and CES.

258
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:52,830
Scott: I think that somebody could investigate get a lawyer and maybe you know find some Bad competition something something.

259
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:54,416
Rym: Yeah, I don't know that.

260
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,250
Rym: I know I was reading not a lawyer.

261
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:07,150
Rym: I was reading about all the weird laws about hotels and There are a lot of crazy weird laws about hotels and what they can and cannot do and when they're forced to give you a room And how they can't turn you away unless they think you're gonna.

262
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:12,330
Scott: Then that's something I should learn because it's like I know all the rules of like what they can do if you're renting and what?

263
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,339
Scott: They can do if you.

264
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,148
Scott: you know.

265
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:21,990
Scott: It's always good to learn about the rules of what someone can and can't do to you like what kind of cop do to you And if he stops you on the street knowing what a hotel can do to you.

266
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,927
Scott: I think it's a very important thing that I must learn.

267
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:26,096
Rym: Well, we haven't.

268
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:28,210
Scott: what are your rights as a hotel guest?

269
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,978
Rym: We only really need to know that if we decide to try to ever run big room parties I said the hotel on fire.

270
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:34,527
Rym: Uh, I don't know.

271
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:45,237
Rym: on one hand I'm kind of sick of room parties at conventions try to steal some towels But on the other hand It would be fun to put on a room party like in the old days at a convention like packs not like an anime con Cuz.

272
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:46,570
Rym: no one's old enough to drink at an anime.

273
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:51,889
Scott: I think our plan of getting a hotel ballroom for the night party and doing overnight gaming is all right.

274
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:53,315
Rym: Here's the one problem with that.

275
00:16:53,616 --> 00:17:06,685
Scott: If anyone would like to sponsor overnight gaming in a hotel ballroom at PAX East or West or West GeekNights at front road crew All we need is enough money to rent out the ballroom and rent a bunch of tables.

276
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,630
Scott: We can take care of the rest.

277
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,869
Rym: All I have to say to that is John Dvorak dot org slash blog.

278
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:22,646
Scott: Yeah, if if Best Buy or some other company would like to you know Lend us a bunch of TVs and video game consoles for our overnight sponsor the GeekNights at packs.

279
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:26,303
Scott: Yes Geek that's appropriate.

280
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:26,464
Scott: I go.

281
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:36,996
Rym: No, so things of the day.

282
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:44,210
Rym: the illustrious Daryl Surratt sent this to me and he basically said that Someone who had some shitty reporter job.

283
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,360
Rym: This was his ultimate moment.

284
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:53,700
Rym: He'd been waiting his entire life to write the headline and I quote Skywalkers in Korea cross Han Solo.

285
00:17:55,722 --> 00:18:13,698
Rym: Apparently there is a high-wire championship in Seoul right now where they got I think 18 people who are professional like walk on the high high tightrope whatever guys and They're going across this river on this one and one point two inch thick wire, it's the Han River.

286
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,125
Rym: Yes Yeah, and they do it solo.

287
00:18:16,406 --> 00:18:17,148
Rym: It's our race.

288
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,355
Rym: Whoever does it the fastest wins.

289
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:22,508
Scott: Whoa What if you fall you fall in the river?

290
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:23,634
Rym: Oh, yeah, do you die?

291
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:24,619
Rym: I don't know.

292
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:30,319
Scott: I mean if you're in the middle of the river, maybe you'll be alright because it's kind of shallow depending on how high you are.

293
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:32,698
Scott: But I mean towards if you're near the edge.

294
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:39,758
Rym: Oh To quote the article the iron cable was supported by 72 foot high towers on either bank of the river.

295
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:43,187
Rym: a Safety net was deployed under the sections of the wire over the riverbanks.

296
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,519
Rym: Otherwise, the Walker's faced a plunge into the swirling gray water.

297
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:48,948
Scott: Yeah, all right.

298
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:49,794
Scott: Well, it depends.

299
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:50,317
Rym: how high was it?

300
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:52,088
Rym: 164 feet?

301
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:53,196
Rym: no, no, no higher than that.

302
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:56,955
Rym: But uh, I'm not getting read the whole article.

303
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:57,840
Rym: You can read the article.

304
00:18:58,181 --> 00:19:03,540
Scott: However, I'm just questioning whether a fall into the water meant death or two people fell into the water and they did not die.

305
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:04,384
Scott: All right, that's good.

306
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:07,497
Rym: But it was a competition and I thought this is really cool

307
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:18,280
Scott: reminds me I watched this video of that guy was bungee jumping and his friends were like, oh right when he was about to jump They're like, oh no wait, and they threw a rope over the edge to make it look like his rope and messed up.

308
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,886
Rym: That's messed up.

309
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:20,892
Scott: They're like.

310
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:22,180
Scott: you thought you were gonna die.

311
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,611
Rym: Wow, it was a kilometer long cable.

312
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:27,218
Scott: Well, that's a big cable.

313
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,947
Scott: Yeah Of course this cables a lot longer than that.

314
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:31,954
Scott: They go across the whole ocean with internets.

315
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:33,820
Rym: There are much more important cables.

316
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:34,887
Scott: Yes much more.

317
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:35,431
Scott: All right.

318
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:40,732
Rym: I like the idea of Competitions like this just direct competition on something very specific and weird.

319
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:41,213
Scott: Mm-hmm.

320
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:42,216
Scott: What was the winning time?

321
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:43,802
Rym: I Don't know.

322
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:45,774
Rym: I didn't read the article and there's two pages of it.

323
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:46,620
Rym: I don't want to click on next.

324
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:53,391
Scott: I would have just ran because if I already have tightrope skills, you know It's all about the confidence and building up the the rhythm and the.

325
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,558
Scott: you know, I don't know.

326
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:56,240
Rym: It's a kilometer.

327
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,094
Rym: Can you even run a whole kilometer?

328
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:01,705
Scott: Oh shit Good god Cuz you're thinking of.

329
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:06,528
Rym: like when you're trying to walk out of railroad tracks you start to fall You run to get as far as you can before you fall.

330
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:07,070
Scott: exactly.

331
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,254
Rym: gotta run a whole kilometer.

332
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:09,056
Scott: Oh god.

333
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:14,694
Scott: Yeah Surprised anyone made it 18 contestants from nine countries.

334
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:15,236
Scott: No.

335
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:23,905
Scott: Well, so There's a programming language called APL and if you'd have asked me like a week ago, like what's APL I'd be like It's a programming language.

336
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,020
Scott: I don't know anything else about it other than there's a programming language called APL.

337
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:34,880
Scott: But apparently APL is really good at doing like, you know grids and two-dimensional array type operations, right?

338
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:37,169
Rym: Ah, like making 2d game.

339
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,445
Scott: Well, basically like making the game of life and This is a YouTube video.

340
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:46,899
Scott: a guy shows you how to make the game of life and basically one line of APL.

341
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:56,440
Scott: And it's like you watch this and you know Like I don't understand that the specifics, you know of how APL works and all these things.

342
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,097
Scott: But I you know, I can understand sort of I can follow him see what he's doing and it's pretty epic.

343
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:03,220
Scott: and it you know.

344
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:09,079
Scott: It makes you want to learn APL, but then you go wait, I'll never use that for anything useful But it's still pretty awesome.

345
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:14,140
Rym: That's the kind of thing if you're a punk kid and you're in some sort of tech school like CS or software engineering.

346
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:15,407
Rym: Do stuff like that.

347
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:16,694
Scott: Yeah, it's it.

348
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,784
Scott: this is an epic epic Programming video.

349
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:23,240
Rym: So I think we just jump right into all the CES news.

350
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:31,084
Rym: Obviously if you want to know all of the CES news or you want the details just go to like Engadget and read The text is there.

351
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:35,279
Rym: We're not gonna talk about how many pixels wide X was and how many jiggawatt?

352
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:41,100
Scott: We are going to comment on how useless half of this shit is ha ha ha ha or how useful a very small portion of it.

353
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:46,358
Rym: I gotta start by talking to how freaking awesome that micro vision laser projector gun was.

354
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:48,406
Scott: All right Tell me about the micro vision laser.

355
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:49,210
Scott: Basically good.

356
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,612
Rym: It's the.

357
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:51,500
Rym: it's this projector that uses lasers.

358
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:54,212
Rym: So it's super focused like no matter where you point it.

359
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:56,000
Rym: Every pixel is like a dot of laser light.

360
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:58,989
Rym: It's like 800 by 400 something pixels.

361
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,212
Rym: It's super bright.

362
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:00,834
Rym: It's awesome.

363
00:22:01,075 --> 00:22:02,820
Rym: It's the kind of thing they're gonna stick on the phone soon.

364
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:03,839
Rym: It's really really tiny.

365
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:10,120
Rym: So to demo it they stuck it on a gun and they set it up such that the gun had motion sensors.

366
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:15,820
Rym: And as you moved the gun around the room, it showed you what you would see in the game.

367
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:24,065
Rym: It was basically like you had a gun and on the wall in front of you was always a screen showing you what was there In real time, but so but if you're looking up It's the gun.

368
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,540
Scott: if you aim the gun at the ceiling you see you can see the sky, right?

369
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,017
Scott: Yes, but if you're aiming at the sky with the gun, you can't really see in front of you.

370
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:37,320
Rym: Yeah Yeah, it was basically just an awesome demo of how crazy cool this projector is.

371
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:42,160
Scott: It was pretty cool, but be even cooler is if it projected everywhere and then to the gun just controlled the gun.

372
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,646
Rym: Well that that's the holodeck.

373
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,208
Rym: that's next.

374
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:47,200
Scott: see they already have that, you know, they've rooms you can do that in.

375
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,345
Rym: Yeah, they're not so great.

376
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:59,974
Rym: I think my my bag is still with the augmented reality Mm-hmm, but this was just a cool tech demo and you know We talked about this almost a year and a half ago when the first inklings of this technology was appearing.

377
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:08,580
Rym: but portable projectors Within the next year or two at anime conventions are going to be the most annoying thing in the world.

378
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:12,220
Scott: Yeah, pretty much everyone projects of anime onto a wall somewhere.

379
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,597
Scott: I mean they're worried now about like you sharing songs with your friends, right?

380
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:17,520
Scott: or you know?

381
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,660
Scott: I mean you read that FBI warning the beginning of a movie.

382
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:19,921
Scott: You know what?

383
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:24,820
Scott: It says you may not show this you may not have a public showing only private home viewing only.

384
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:28,520
Scott: Dude, what happens when anyone can project any movie onto any wall?

385
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:41,739
Scott: People are gonna go download a cam of like avatar Projected onto a wall with their cell phone in 3d and hand out glasses to everybody and watch it on like the side of a building And all the homeless guys will walk over.

386
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:46,016
Scott: That is what they should be worried about and you know, what is nothing they can do.

387
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:46,920
Scott: So worrying is useless.

388
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:47,750
Scott: Don't worry about it.

389
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,317
Scott: Just deal with it.

390
00:23:48,560 --> 00:24:02,785
Rym: however it's gonna be pretty badass because the one thing is the anime con culture has the Some guy's gonna bring like his computer and like laptop and screen and everything to play like his stupid game and show people music videos or something and People are gonna like gaming.

391
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,420
Rym: cons primarily aren't willing to deal with all that BS.

392
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:08,791
Scott: We don't have to everyone cell phone.

393
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,220
Scott: Basically, you'll turn yourself on sideways.

394
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:15,134
Scott: It'll be a game controller and a projector simultaneously and you just pull.

395
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,607
Scott: so your friend will pull out his cell phone Connect to you.

396
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:18,636
Scott: He won't even connect to you.

397
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,880
Scott: I guess they might have to connect with bluetooth or Wi-Fi or something.

398
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:26,600
Scott: And now you each have your own screen projected on the wall and you're playing a fighting game against each other or something.

399
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,146
Rym: That is gonna be awesome.

400
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:31,640
Scott: So you just walk up to you see bump into someone on the subway like hey, what's up?

401
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,664
Scott: Hey, let's play a game.

402
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:35,018
Scott: All right, you aim your phones at the wall and just play a game.

403
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:41,899
Rym: However, once they're ubiquitous enough to where they're everywhere, you know Like you can assume that most cell phones have them like how most cell phones have cameras today.

404
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:44,208
Rym: Go see it's gonna happen.

405
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,295
Scott: Oh, yeah go see on the wall.

406
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:54,460
Rym: It's gonna happen a lot But we have to wait until there's that peak where they're not Common enough to where everyone's used to them like laser pointers.

407
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,320
Rym: Remember when laser pointers first got popular and for like a year, they're just red dots everywhere.

408
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,492
Rym: As soon as they got cheap enough when they're ubiquitous and novel go see everywhere.

409
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:06,060
Rym: once they're ubiquitous and non-novel that problem will disappear.

410
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:10,080
Scott: Yeah, but people still use them for like a game on the wall or that sort of stuff.

411
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,879
Rym: Yeah, I don't want to talk about all the different projection things beyond that.

412
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:17,835
Rym: Portable projectors are going to be huge within the next year at the convention circuit.

413
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:22,592
Rym: Mm-hmm Okay, I guess I have to bring everything up.

414
00:25:22,632 --> 00:25:23,737
Rym: captain forgot his laptop.

415
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:24,460
Scott: No, I got one.

416
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,036
Scott: So there was this, you know guitar called the you rock guitar.

417
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:30,280
Rym: Oh, that thing's pretty cool.

418
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:33,125
Scott: So what it is, it's a guitar But it doesn't.

419
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:37,522
Scott: you don't have to tune the strings and I don't think they break either because it's a MIDI controller It's right.

420
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,388
Scott: See you play it like a guitar.

421
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:42,640
Scott: you hold down strings and strum them and pluck them and whatnot, right?

422
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:51,867
Scott: However, it's a MIDI controller so You can use it to control any MIDI anything and it just has USB cable that comes into it and plugs right into the front Of your computer and you're good.

423
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:56,510
Scott: and it works pretty well with I guess the default Apple MIDI thing like.

424
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,899
Scott: that's what they tested it with, you know.

425
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,149
Scott: Secondly I'm pretty sure that you can play rock band slash guitar hero with it Somehow even though I didn't read how that works.

426
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:07,514
Scott: It works apparently, right?

427
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:09,080
Scott: So that's already two things.

428
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:10,073
Scott: It does three things.

429
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:15,700
Scott: it does Right, you can sort of like there's a there's a dial and you can dial up all these different instruments.

430
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:26,760
Scott: You can play like, you know, even sounds that normal guitars usually can't make but you can like put it in like You know metal mode and go dah dah dah dah and you can put an acoustic mode and all sorts of you know modes.

431
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,038
Rym: Does it have both squiggly and mealy?

432
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:37,352
Scott: It has like ten squealies and ten mealy's and apparently you can download more squealies and more mealy's right because it's like it's you know Internet's.

433
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,789
Scott: Then on top of that, it's got background music.

434
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:50,920
Scott: So like you could put down like, you know, the blues, you know Or whatever or like some jazz and it'll go it'll just start making like a background music like doo doo doo doo And then it's up to you to play in front of that, right?

435
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:56,100
Scott: So, you know you gets all sorts of backing tracks, you know, you could put like some, you know metal backing track.

436
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,740
Scott: It'll like play a drum like digga digga digga digga digga and then you go.

437
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,567
Rym: Now this is interesting in a lot of ways.

438
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,571
Rym: I mean think about what happened with auto-tune and how we like more and more.

439
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:22,004
Rym: celebrity singers aren't actually necessarily that good but you can make them sound good and eventually the technology is gonna get to the point to where you can have a fake guitar and if it like a microphone and Everything and you won't be able to tell that it's augmented and basically everyone will be able to sing Whatever is in their head

440
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:25,862
Scott: everyone be able to be a rock star and sound like exactly what you know They imagine.

441
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:30,740
Rym: almost I wonder what that's going to do for a lot of culture and media.

442
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:43,539
Rym: I mean, there's no way around it's gonna get to the point to where there will be people who everyone's a rock star Or no in the very least where anyone who has any idea in their head that is musical We'll be able to get it out.

443
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:51,049
Rym: If Lee at least if it's single person music or maybe single person and backing tracks We'll be able to kind of get it out there in a listenable form.

444
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,903
Rym: that is going to kill the majority of like generic Pop music.

445
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:56,787
Scott: Well, I mean think about it.

446
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:59,680
Scott: What if anyone in the world was good at programming?

447
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,794
Scott: Well, there'd be no job for a programmer, right?

448
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:02,418
Scott: What if you know?

449
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,480
Scott: What if everyone in the world could make music them?

450
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,380
Rym: You know job for musicians if everyone in the world was good at music if everyone in the world could play the every instrument?

451
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:24,780
Rym: Very well, not, you know perfectly not virtuoso, but very well effectively even if they had no training You will drive up the demand for and value of the virtuosos the crazily talented and skilled people.

452
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:33,180
Scott: Yeah, but you will destroy the market for anyone who is just really really exactly what I was gonna say Which you know what those virtuosos will be hired to do.

453
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:38,240
Scott: They'll be hired to make the music and all that stuff that goes into the instruments that everyone else is playing.

454
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:39,987
Scott: Right Dave.

455
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:41,580
Rym: This is probably Dave Riley's paradise.

456
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:45,765
Rym: He will just be singing non-stop for the rest of his life wandering around the city Maybe but he is.

457
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:48,259
Scott: let me I didn't finish telling you about the things this guitar does.

458
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,715
Scott: This guitar you can put it into you rock mode and what it does.

459
00:28:52,776 --> 00:29:10,620
Scott: and you rock mode is Let's say you put on a backing track that's in the key of f-sharp, right and you rock mode it will disable all notes that are not in the key of f-sharp and If you try to play a note that's in the key of f-sharp It'll sort of make the guitar hero like you suck noise like growl, you know that that sort of oops noise.

460
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:21,344
Scott: So you put it in this mode and you just sort of a met you to learn which notes are available and which ones aren't And you will always be in key Right, and it's all digital.

461
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:26,863
Scott: so like your technique doesn't matter that much as long as you hit the right note and it just gotta Have rhythm.

462
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:30,660
Scott: I think yeah, I mean, yeah, it'll be all your rhythm timing and hit the right note.

463
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:34,539
Scott: It won't matter like, you know other things because it's a MIDI controller It's not you know.

464
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:34,781
Scott: This

465
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:35,544
Rym: is a good way to learn

466
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:38,878
Scott: as a whammy bar to for like which pitch shifts if you if you whammy it

467
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,570
Rym: you'll learn How to be a mediocre to average improvisationalist,

468
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:49,191
Scott: but I mean and this thing is, you know expandable though, you know People are gonna firmwares this thing and but they really it's.

469
00:29:49,552 --> 00:29:57,040
Scott: it's good to see someone actually take this technology That is incredibly old and actually push it to its limit or close to its limit or further.

470
00:29:57,683 --> 00:29:57,823
Rym: Not.

471
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:01,177
Rym: so they're not pushing it to its limit because you could do this a lot better in a studio you could.

472
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:06,760
Rym: they're taking What is just good enough for consumers and making it mass-market and they're also make you know.

473
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,889
Scott: But I think the things that they're doing are things that could have been done a while ago, you know They just weren't, you know, they could have.

474
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,400
Scott: someone could have made a device like this, you know ages ago.

475
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:17,030
Scott: What are they gonna do?

476
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:24,840
Rym: I don't want to talk about this in depth So eventually it'll get to the point to where you can augment your own performances in real time to sound like whatever you want.

477
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:31,580
Rym: What are they gonna do when I can perform stairway perfectly like Led Zeppelin entirely by myself?

478
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,426
Rym: I'm not playing a recording.

479
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:34,570
Rym: I'm performing.

480
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,517
Rym: Yeah, what's that gonna do?

481
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:39,206
Scott: I'll just record Myself playing stairway.

482
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:42,780
Scott: I'll push I'll make an mp3 of me singing it and I'll listen to that.

483
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:44,346
Scott: Listen to it.

484
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:47,718
Scott: It's exactly the same as the original studio recording if not better.

485
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:51,940
Rym: Here's the thing I would have to pay statutory royalties as a cover if I performed it.

486
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,003
Scott: It's a lot like five bucks.

487
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:59,423
Rym: However, if everyone just records their own version of everything that ruins Everything.

488
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:03,100
Rym: when it comes to IP rights, it sure does but that's all pie in the sky.

489
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,740
Rym: It's gonna be at least a couple decades before we get anywhere near that.

490
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,920
Scott: We're still gonna get much closer in the short term.

491
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,680
Scott: It's gonna be a lot easier for people to play much better music with a lot less musical talent.

492
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:22,860
Rym: I foresee a lot more cosplay skits and an Improvisational fun like public things happening that are good as opposed to horrifying or no.

493
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,220
Scott: It'll just improve the quality of no talent.

494
00:31:26,402 --> 00:31:35,080
Scott: You know the same way that like, you know Like GTR turns the no talent driver into a doesn't crash or like a better camera can turn a YouTube video better.

495
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:36,900
Scott: You know, it's that same kind of thing.

496
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:47,168
Scott: It's like let's increase the quality of the tools make them easier such that the quality of amateur production will increase without Necessitating amateurs learning anything.

497
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:49,897
Rym: what it really reeks of it's the idea of intelligent defaults.

498
00:31:49,937 --> 00:31:50,720
Rym: taken to the extreme.

499
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,827
Rym: It's playing default songs that are pretty good.

500
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:55,175
Rym: Yeah, it's got it by that logic.

501
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:56,780
Rym: and acoustic guitar is Linux.

502
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,414
Rym: You got to figure out all this bullshit about it.

503
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:00,399
Scott: You gotta tune it.

504
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:05,736
Rym: There's tablatures and that's even like the like my break someone using tabs.

505
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:07,000
Rym: that's like downloading the rpm.

506
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,287
Rym: You gotta compile that yourself.

507
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:10,260
Rym: Mmm, so let's move on.

508
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:13,800
Rym: Nintendo hinted that maybe they might possibly have Netflix.

509
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:16,952
Scott: Like hitting that Nintendo would have net.

510
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:20,404
Rym: and Nintendo was like, yeah The no one.

511
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:21,450
Rym: there was nothing clear here.

512
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,616
Rym: All I have to say is it doesn't matter.

513
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:23,460
Rym: It's too little too late.

514
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:23,861
Rym: There's no.

515
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:28,758
Rym: no one who wants Netflix on a device doesn't already have another device to do it.

516
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:33,458
Scott: at this point You know and it points out now people don't seem to realize is they don't look often at the US.

517
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:35,806
Scott: Japan Divide on these things right?

518
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,531
Scott: the Xbox had the Netflix.

519
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,337
Scott: That's a US device.

520
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:40,440
Scott: the ps3 had the Netflix.

521
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,468
Scott: Does it even have it now?

522
00:32:41,528 --> 00:32:42,294
Scott: I'm pretty sure it does.

523
00:32:42,354 --> 00:32:44,405
Rym: Yes, three does I believe it got it late.

524
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:48,340
Scott: if it did it got it after the Xbox did which is because they're Japanese.

525
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,335
Scott: They don't have Netflix really and you know, they might have something else, but they don't have Netflix.

526
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:53,780
Scott: Yeah, it's not on their radar.

527
00:32:53,941 --> 00:33:01,314
Scott: well, I think this is why Nintendo is is missing out on a lot of things because Nintendo of America, you know, we think about like Reggie and stuff.

528
00:33:01,374 --> 00:33:02,760
Scott: Reggie can't really do that much.

529
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,039
Scott: He doesn't make any games.

530
00:33:04,301 --> 00:33:05,305
Scott: They know what's hardware.

531
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:09,179
Rym: Nintendo of America has always known what's up and Nintendo of Japan often will.

532
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,420
Scott: Nintendo Japan is where everything happens.

533
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,840
Scott: Nintendo of America is basically just salespeople that just take stuff from Nintendo of Japan and market it in the US.

534
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:21,500
Scott: They don't really have too much say in what gets made or how it's made.

535
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,440
Rym: I mean look in the old days you had Nintendo Japan saying Americans are too stupid to play our games.

536
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,925
Rym: We'll give them the easy modes.

537
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:28,446
Rym: Now.

538
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:32,680
Rym: You have Nintendo Japan saying why would anyone want to rent videos on a console?

539
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,248
Rym: No one does that here.

540
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,020
Rym: Why would anyone do it in America?

541
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:39,071
Scott: Yeah, I mean Nintendo of Europe is the same way.

542
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:40,920
Scott: It's basically just a selling company.

543
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:46,880
Scott: It's all salespeople and Nintendo of Japan makes everything and it's just up to them to sell it to Europeans.

544
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:59,020
Scott: You know and I think in the longer run this is gonna start to hurt Nintendo because Even all these normal people who bought all sorts of Wiis and made them so much money are not buying that many Wii games.

545
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,749
Scott: they're only buying like three.

546
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:07,098
Scott: Wii Sports is Wii fits and Mario and Their Wiis are collecting dust and they know it.

547
00:34:08,483 --> 00:34:09,928
Rym: Thing is they made a profit on all the Wii.

548
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:17,871
Scott: Yes, but in the long run when they have to come out with Wii 2 People are gonna see there We won with this pile of dust and they're not gonna buy Wii 2.

549
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:20,360
Rym: the thing is the normal people might the muggles my I don't.

550
00:34:20,741 --> 00:34:22,166
Scott: I don't think so.

551
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,429
Rym: Nintendo's real problem.

552
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:26,260
Scott: They'll buy DS 2, but I don't know if they'll buy we.

553
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,601
Rym: You know what?

554
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:29,516
Rym: We shouldn't talk about Nintendo's problems because that is a Tuesday show.

555
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:30,000
Scott: That's true.

556
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,339
Rym: There's been a lot of augmented reality stuff at CES.

557
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:44,580
Rym: I don't get into all of it but there are a couple of different like glasses and they all look stupid and they're pretty poor but I Really want augmented reality to be awesome, but it's at least five to ten years out sadly.

558
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,172
Scott: Yeah, I mean MIT has that thing.

559
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:53,760
Scott: I forget what it's called But basically it to wear this big Electronic thing around your neck and it's smaller than this kind of thing has ever been but it's still too big.

560
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,320
Rym: I really just want my glasses now to have a wireframe overlay so I can tag people as stupid or not stupid.

561
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,327
Scott: Yeah, you only have two tags.

562
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:11,360
Rym: Well, you know that would suffice for the majority of what I do Mmm, I mean second would be having the the Grand Theft Auto arrow pointing where to go when I'm driving or walking.

563
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:12,024
Scott: Yeah, we need that.

564
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:13,915
Rym: and then the stupid not stupid tag.

565
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:16,700
Scott: Mmm All Right.

566
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,568
Scott: So let's talk about this boxy box, right?

567
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:19,572
Scott: It's really pretty.

568
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,580
Scott: It's a really nice looking box, right?

569
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,263
Scott: It stands.

570
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:25,420
Scott: they made it that way so that it stands out in your home media center.

571
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,660
Scott: You know apart from all the normal boxes that way it'll get attention to people come over to your house.

572
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:31,999
Scott: I think that was a good decision for marketing and such.

573
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:34,871
Scott: It's also pretty powerful box.

574
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,163
Scott: It's gonna run boxy pretty damn Well, you know.

575
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:42,460
Scott: considering that's all it's designed to do and if you just want to have boxy, this is not a bad idea.

576
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,169
Scott: However, there is a problem with the boxy box.

577
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:48,300
Scott: The problem is that all it does is run boxy.

578
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:49,404
Scott: I could go and buy.

579
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:50,047
Scott: it's gonna blow up.

580
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:53,000
Scott: I mean all it does is run boxy, but it is cheap.

581
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,509
Scott: It's only like they said it's gonna be like $200, right but for $4.99.

582
00:35:55,509 --> 00:36:04,302
Scott: ish I can go get an aces triple-e 1501 which runs boxy just as well If not better.

583
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:11,959
Scott: and also is a computer with Windows 7 which means it can do any anything like, you know run an emulator.

584
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:16,491
Scott: You know run Windows Media Center extender, so it could be a DVR.

585
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:19,220
Scott: it can do all sorts of stuff because it's a computer.

586
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,288
Scott: It's basically a netbook without a with.

587
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:25,479
Scott: that's not a laptop and you could plug it into your TV with H You know an HDMI cable.

588
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:28,560
Rym: Well, there's a lot of competition in this space now, too.

589
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,039
Rym: I mean, there's that pop box that a lot of people are talking about.

590
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:34,939
Scott: Yeah, and I mean there's a company they made this thing called the new box.

591
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,679
Scott: Basically, all it is is a netbook just like I you know a net top just like I said.

592
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:46,360
Scott: only They just pre-installed pretty much every media program in the world on it and also there it is slowly.

593
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,738
Rym: Actual televisions are having more and more of this functionality just built in even though they implemented shiddily and drme.

594
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:55,440
Rym: It's there Mmm, and there's the problem that you know, well not really the problem.

595
00:36:55,802 --> 00:37:01,100
Rym: I was looking at the Mac minis because I was thinking you know Maybe buy the new Mac mini at some point get rid of the old one.

596
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:08,219
Rym: I don't know what to do yet But they very clearly and prominently suggest on the Mac mini site and Apple now hook it up to your TV.

597
00:37:08,582 --> 00:37:12,366
Rym: It's an amazing media PC Mmm, and it is.

598
00:37:12,386 --> 00:37:13,351
Rym: I mean it really is.

599
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:13,512
Rym: it's.

600
00:37:13,612 --> 00:37:19,260
Rym: it's more expensive than everything else But it has some of the most beautiful form factor there is for that sort of thing.

601
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:24,700
Scott: The thing is I think the aces is a better choice than the Mac mini right now because it has windows 7 emulato.

602
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:31,341
Scott: It can do more than the Mac mini can do right and it's cheaper by like over $100.

603
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:34,031
Rym: The only thing the Mac minis got going right now is the.

604
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:35,818
Scott: the aces has an HDMI output.

605
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:42,199
Scott: with the Mac mini you need to get like a mini display port to HDMI converter and a special optical audio cable and a.

606
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,271
Rym: All the Mac minis got going for it.

607
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,880
Rym: Is that OS X is really pretty though?

608
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,639
Rym: That's not really a deal maker right there.

609
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:53,336
Rym: And the form factor is perfect because it's completely a hundred percent silent and tiny.

610
00:37:53,497 --> 00:37:54,660
Scott: the other the other one smile.

611
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,363
Scott: It's silent tiny.

612
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:56,770
Rym: Also, is it actually silent?

613
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:57,976
Rym: A lot of people said it's not.

614
00:37:58,017 --> 00:37:58,660
Rym: it makes a little word.

615
00:37:58,961 --> 00:37:59,242
Scott: I don't know.

616
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:00,005
Scott: I had to go listen to.

617
00:38:00,046 --> 00:38:02,195
Scott: I don't know either but it looks silent and tiny to me.

618
00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:03,380
Rym: It looks silent.

619
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:07,554
Rym: So I want to talk about this really quick.

620
00:38:08,016 --> 00:38:08,640
Rym: the Zomteather.

621
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,297
Scott: Oh wait I forgot one thing though about the boxy box the boxy box remote control.

622
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:14,240
Rym: Oh my god.

623
00:38:14,722 --> 00:38:17,834
Scott: Ah, if they don't sell that fucker separately, I swear to God.

624
00:38:17,894 --> 00:38:26,306
Scott: basically what it is on one side It's you know four arrows with a button in the middle You know just like the Mac mini the the Apple remote sort of only a little bit bigger.

625
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:30,752
Scott: on the other side is a keyboard Genius.

626
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:35,250
Scott: why do we have that stupid full-sized, you know wireless keyboard in the living room all this time?

627
00:38:35,351 --> 00:38:39,115
Scott: We could have had a remote control like that because that remote didn't exist yet Even though it should have.

628
00:38:39,557 --> 00:38:44,390
Scott: Oh God if they sell that remote control separately I might just buy two and if they don't sell it separately.

629
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,683
Rym: I might just buy a boxy box because you get the fucking remote control.

630
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:51,960
Rym: I'll sell the boxy box on eBay With boxy box no remote control.

631
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,024
Scott: one hundred and fifty dollars.

632
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:54,329
Rym: You don't need the remote.

633
00:38:57,191 --> 00:39:00,356
Rym: So the Zom wireless tether all it is Bluetooth device.

634
00:39:00,596 --> 00:39:02,859
Rym: you you link it to your phone or something.

635
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,586
Rym: if you get too far away from your phone and starts beeping to remind you that you left your fucking phone behind.

636
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,890
Rym: Oh, I think that's a pretty cool.

637
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:11,340
Scott: Wait a minute.

638
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,730
Scott: So what if you forget the tether?

639
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,494
Rym: Well, I don't know.

640
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:15,679
Rym: I didn't look into it more than that.

641
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,347
Rym: You put the tether on your keychain.

642
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,389
Scott: Ah What if you get your keys?

643
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,210
Rym: Well, maybe get two tethers and tether them together.

644
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:26,250
Scott: I guess one thing that's good about it though is like if you know it also acts as a speakerphone.

645
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:32,040
Scott: Okay, one thing that is good about it is like, okay Let's see you have the phone but you forgot your keys, right?

646
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,924
Scott: Yeah, I'll be.

647
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,194
Scott: if you have the keys and forgot the phone It'll beep.

648
00:39:35,636 --> 00:39:37,770
Scott: so you can't go wrong in both directions.

649
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:45,204
Rym: Of course if you forget all of your do everything at the same time You're in the I'm one step away from being a hobo situation.

650
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:46,227
Rym: There's really nothing you can do.

651
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:49,630
Scott: Anyway, yeah I'm gonna get stuck outside and not be able to call anybody.

652
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:56,410
Rym: You know what I realized if it weren't for the fact that I Almost know Emily's number by heart like I could probably dial.

653
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,694
Scott: I don't know anyone's phone number.

654
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:06,244
Rym: if I was like out somewhere like in the street and I lost my wallet and my cell phone There is almost no way for me to get help.

655
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:07,650
Rym: No, not really.

656
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:13,394
Rym: I would usually have to go to a Starbucks beg them beg someone to let me use their computer to get on my email and Message someone.

657
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:15,364
Rym: Oh, no public library.

658
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:16,450
Scott: That's not a bad idea.

659
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,278
Scott: Just go find a computer with a web browser and you're okay.

660
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:27,465
Rym: magic Jack has that femtocell which is I Don't know that whole thing wallet shady.

661
00:40:27,485 --> 00:40:34,070
Rym: I Foresee many many more things like that that are not magic Jack but are just nerds doing it on their own.

662
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:36,830
Rym: Well my you know magic Jack made a femtocell.

663
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,450
Rym: So basically your cell phone will sync to it with GSM instead of anything else.

664
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:47,850
Rym: Yep, and then it's basically you can make calls like a real cell phone without any like no one knows but his voice.

665
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,454
Scott: Yes, it is Some people don't realize.

666
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:53,630
Scott: is that you know Verizon and Sprint with their CDMA of do whatever is right?

667
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,717
Scott: That's all proprietary technology.

668
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:59,410
Scott: If you want to connect to that kind of network, you need to buy chips from Qualcomm.

669
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:01,648
Scott: You know the company Qualcomm, that's what they do.

670
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:07,949
Scott: If you use GSM GPRS edge HSD PA that's all open source stuff, right?

671
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:15,242
Scott: There Pete that there were like tech conferences in Europe where nerds just set up their own GSM networks Just you know and handed out SIM cards.

672
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:16,530
Rym: now, you know, what's gonna happen?

673
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,750
Rym: Especially if there's more white space in the spectrum and all that sort of stuff?

674
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:26,893
Rym: we're gonna get to the point where either nerds just put open femto cells all over the place connected to the internet or I don't know.

675
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:30,010
Rym: the possibilities are endless and I don't want to sidetrack the whole show with them.

676
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,261
Rym: But that is cool and magic.

677
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:32,623
Rym: Jack.

678
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:41,455
Rym: while they reek of shady They seem to do what they say they do and that sort of thing is gonna completely screw Verizon and Sprint in the long run.

679
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:46,187
Rym: Yeah, especially because now Verizon saying yeah, no more unlimited plans possibly.

680
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:49,375
Scott: Well, another thing is that The femto cells.

681
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:55,582
Scott: the original idea was that like, you know, okay, I'm an AT&T customer But they don't really have service so much in my apartment.

682
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:57,250
Scott: Maybe it's blocked by the walls or something.

683
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,604
Scott: Yeah, so I go and get a femto cell.

684
00:41:59,644 --> 00:42:00,489
Scott: put it in my apartment.

685
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:08,240
Scott: now I have good coverage of my apartment - the problem is they wanted the customer to buy the femto cell Right and then keep it in their apartment.

686
00:42:08,261 --> 00:42:09,266
Scott: It's like, excuse me.

687
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:10,010
Scott: You've got it wrong.

688
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:17,730
Scott: You you should give me half off my plan for installing a femto cell and donating my electricity To your freaking network or not?

689
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:25,596
Rym: Just that the idea that just give them away for free to anyone who wants them and then you basically Increased your network a lot.

690
00:42:25,797 --> 00:42:32,224
Scott: You're not without having to wait for a lot less than the expense of building towers - yep In fact have multiple levels have like a tiny one.

691
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:33,130
Rym: That's just in a house.

692
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,055
Rym: It's kind of low-powered.

693
00:42:34,457 --> 00:42:37,070
Rym: have a more powerful one for nerds that just goes on the roof.

694
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,250
Scott: Well, yeah, you find out where someone's living before you figure out which one you're gonna give them.

695
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,904
Rym: Yeah, I mean think you say you live in a neighborhood with nimby So you get bad cell service because no one will let him build a cell tower.

696
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:48,215
Rym: if you live there Just have a roof tile.

697
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:51,046
Rym: That's actually a femto cell and now you've got great cell coverage.

698
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:54,234
Rym: Yep All that stuff is cool.

699
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:55,718
Scott: Mm-hmm.

700
00:42:55,758 --> 00:42:57,865
Rym: There's the Ford sinking Google stuff.

701
00:42:57,885 --> 00:42:58,828
Rym: They talked more about that.

702
00:42:58,868 --> 00:42:59,650
Rym: There were some demos.

703
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:05,130
Scott: Yeah, the Ford sink is looking like you're finally gonna have basically a computer in your car that you know.

704
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,877
Scott: Does everything that your computer does.

705
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,950
Scott: you can check your emails and your sports and two items of note?

706
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:23,903
Rym: The long run of this is cars that talk to each other and you'll basically have real-time traffic data That is accurate and rerouting and all that stuff and you'll have an ad hoc network effectively of all the cars which alleviates a lot of problems with coverage.

707
00:43:23,943 --> 00:43:24,928
Rym: internet in the car all the time.

708
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:30,490
Rym: and As far as I can tell there's a podcast button or channel to start.

709
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:37,968
Rym: I think we're finally getting to the point to where in cars which is where most People who aren't in major cities with mass transit listen to the radio.

710
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:43,089
Rym: now We'll be able to just listen to a podcast like it's radio and not know that it's not radio.

711
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:49,950
Scott: Yeah That's you know, that was the thing I wanted for podcasting all along was you know, it needs to just be on-demand audio.

712
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:58,570
Scott: You know someone browses through a directory of audio content pushes a button It just plays immediately and all the content is in the library all the time that not even just that with these cars.

713
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:05,090
Rym: It's also got to have these serious equivalent where someone makes podcast quote-unquote stations that aren't live or anything.

714
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,490
Rym: It's just playing something all the time and people smell a lot of satellite radio.

715
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,778
Scott: There are channels that just play podcasts in order.

716
00:44:10,938 --> 00:44:11,179
Scott: Yep.

717
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:14,230
Rym: We looked into doing serious long time ago, which is only pain.

718
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:19,430
Rym: It was too much of a hassle to conform to the standard to fit like in the time slots and stuff.

719
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,305
Scott: They also support things like stitcher.

720
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:26,150
Scott: with stitcher What you can do is like let's say you know that you drive an hour in the morning and an hour on the way home.

721
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:40,550
Scott: Right with stitcher you can be like, yeah I want to listen to the traffic for this area then the weather then this news guy then this news guy then You know this, you know band and then and then it basically puts together every day.

722
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:42,562
Scott: You know the thing for you to listen to.

723
00:44:42,582 --> 00:44:43,770
Rym: stitcher is pretty cool.

724
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,670
Rym: I actually I've been using down my pre through the beta and everything and we should interview them.

725
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,095
Rym: Actually, I've emailed him a bunch of time.

726
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:53,510
Rym: No, did you cuz way back when their podcast like directory had almost nothing I wanted in it.

727
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,944
Rym: I was like your thing sucks and I listed like everything I wanted to listen to.

728
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,330
Rym: they didn't have that day.

729
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,893
Rym: They emailed me.

730
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:00,744
Rym: They're like, those are all added anything else we should add.

731
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:04,179
Rym: Yeah No, and they're like any suggestions anything anything.

732
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:06,750
Rym: and they're like, yeah, it looks like you do a radio show blah blah blah.

733
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,793
Rym: So they're cool people.

734
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:08,154
Scott: Yeah.

735
00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:09,238
Scott: All righty.

736
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,215
Rym: Yeah, there's that mobile credit card swiper for the iPhone Brilliant.

737
00:45:15,235 --> 00:45:17,167
Scott: Yeah, can I say really been around for a while?

738
00:45:17,268 --> 00:45:19,697
Rym: I know But there was something about it here.

739
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:22,345
Rym: They'd announce something about it at CES.

740
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:22,927
Rym: I don't know what.

741
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:23,670
Rym: mm-hmm.

742
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:25,503
Rym: Oh, I think this is a different one.

743
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:27,453
Rym: No Regardless.

744
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:32,790
Rym: I look forward to the day to where everyone has a card scanner or the equivalent.

745
00:45:33,253 --> 00:45:35,590
Rym: And if I want to give money to Scott, I just swipe my card on.

746
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,204
Scott: Why do we look at I'm swiping a card into someone's phone, right?

747
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:40,910
Scott: Why don't we just bump our phones together?

748
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:47,690
Rym: Seriously well because Bluetooth and every every information sharing thing like that has always been crippled by bullshit.

749
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:55,507
Rym: yep, and This swiping a credit card is the only thing that's not crippled by bullshit because the credit card companies want you to swipe it as much as possible.

750
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,360
Rym: Nvidia ion Demonstrated it's everything it lived up to be.

751
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,107
Scott: Well, that's what's in that aces.

752
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:03,790
Scott: I was talking about.

753
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:10,010
Scott: Yeah, basically if people still don't know I've talked about it before I think the Nvidia ion is a GPU.

754
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:11,615
Scott: That's really cheap, right?

755
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:15,346
Scott: It's not gonna run the latest and greatest games, but I probably play half-life.

756
00:46:15,646 --> 00:46:16,850
Scott: It'll play old games.

757
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,157
Scott: Yeah relative, you know, it might even play half-life - who knows.

758
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,090
Scott: but what it is is a very low power very inexpensive GPU.

759
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,489
Scott: So what you can do is you can get a cheapo computer like a netbook with the Intel atom CPU.

760
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,774
Rym: We're talking on netbook.

761
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:30,640
Rym: That's like you can make a computer.

762
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,530
Rym: That is the size of like my three harmonic is sitting next to each other.

763
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:34,715
Scott: Well, maybe not that small.

764
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:36,162
Rym: I'm looking at a picture of one right now.

765
00:46:36,202 --> 00:46:37,308
Rym: That's that's this big.

766
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:38,895
Rym: Okay It's the entire computer.

767
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:41,770
Scott: So and then you put the Nvidia ion GPU next to it.

768
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,440
Scott: It doesn't use that much more electricity.

769
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,050
Scott: So your battery life isn't gonna get killed.

770
00:46:45,130 --> 00:47:01,918
Scott: Yeah, right, but you now have a GPU which means that if you're gonna use your netbook for things like watching Flash videos right watching any sort of video that can be accelerated by the GPU doing anything HD Doing anything with only a little bit of 3d in it.

771
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,363
Scott: now you can do it.

772
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:13,770
Scott: You can have a really low power Cheap inexpensive tiny computer that could actually like play HD videos that you downloaded from iTunes or whatever.

773
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:15,225
Scott: That is crazy.

774
00:47:15,286 --> 00:47:18,758
Scott: It's like You know, it's not like a Ferrari.

775
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:28,130
Scott: It's like, you know, it's almost like a Taurus SHO, you know It looks like a normal slow black car, but secretly it's pretty fast.

776
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:35,441
Scott: Not Ferrari fast not Porsche fast, but like, you know Mustang fast, but doesn't look like a Mustang at all.

777
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:37,290
Scott: It looks like a Pete looks like a piece of crap.

778
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:41,186
Scott: There's the and cotton, you know only cost what a piece of crap costs.

779
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:44,379
Rym: also Open peak made an atom-powered.

780
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,270
Rym: They call it the pro frame VoIP phone.

781
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,978
Rym: It's like it's a business e VoIP phone like all those VoIP phones.

782
00:47:49,038 --> 00:47:50,262
Scott: I mean, have you seen true phone?

783
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:52,870
Rym: I believe yes true phone.

784
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:56,351
Scott: It's like TRU phone and a lot of people in Europe use it Apparently.

785
00:47:56,391 --> 00:47:59,181
Scott: what it is is I think it's an app you can get for most.

786
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:07,009
Scott: I think it's on iPhone and it's iPhone Android web, I forget which ones it's on and which ones is not on but they want it to be on all of them.

787
00:48:07,029 --> 00:48:16,189
Scott: and Basically, what it does is you know, you can you know have Skype and then you can call Skype people for free But then you got to pay for anyone else.

788
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,439
Rym: No this is like a VoIP phone to replace my VoIP phone.

789
00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:25,241
Rym: the one up there and every business e VoIP phone is Has the old-school interface that old-school business people are used to.

790
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:33,323
Rym: this one has a big color touchscreen Multi-touch icons like all the user interface that I want my phone.

791
00:48:33,363 --> 00:48:39,210
Rym: if I want to dial someone's number and I don't know their number I have to type their name in like I'm texting it just awful.

792
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:41,036
Scott: Now what the true phone does?

793
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:45,290
Scott: it lets you call Skype for free unless you call a gizmo for free.

794
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:50,170
Scott: It lets you call without anything anyone that it can call for free over some sort of VoIP.

795
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:56,150
Scott: It will call for free and if it has to use the actual phone lines, then they'll charge you money.

796
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:01,809
Scott: But what they charge to call anyone in the US on any phone, you know calls to any phone in the?

797
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:03,095
Scott: u.s Like three cents a minute.

798
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:13,769
Scott: So people in the in Europe are like true phone Using that for my international calls or even you know non international calls because it's just incredibly cheap for the.

799
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:20,515
Scott: you know Even when it does charge you money and if it can make a free call for free it will every single time Which is pretty awesome.

800
00:49:20,596 --> 00:49:28,983
Rym: So if you're looking to save money on lots of international calls true phone I think we should wrap this up with perhaps the most important part of CES.

801
00:49:29,064 --> 00:49:32,455
Rym: Mm-hmm the in gadget crap gadget No and catchy.

802
00:49:32,796 --> 00:49:42,430
Scott: So yeah and gadget goes around and they love to find, you know Well, they have the curves right which is the keeping it real fake Which is all like the the boot, you know the thing that looks like an iPhone, but it's not an iPhone.

803
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:45,042
Scott: But that CES they do the crap gadget.

804
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:46,870
Scott: They basically find gadgets that are crap.

805
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:53,770
Rym: Those shoes that are ugly high-heeled plastic pink shoes that are also speakers.

806
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:55,780
Scott: I think that they're only speakers.

807
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,989
Scott: I don't think they're you supposed to wear them?

808
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,920
Rym: Yeah, apparently everyone kept asking them.

809
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:01,347
Rym: So do I wear them or what?

810
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:03,711
Scott: Yeah They're.

811
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:05,517
Rym: they're horrifyingly ugly.

812
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:09,290
Scott: I don't understand why you would want speakers that look like high-heeled shiny shoes.

813
00:50:09,691 --> 00:50:16,489
Rym: There's that finger ist which is basically a giant ugly keyboard to stick on your iPhone and then try to play it like a guitar.

814
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,053
Scott: Alright, no.

815
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:23,129
Rym: Yeah, I see the picture of the iPhone screen and they draw like a bunch of strings on it.

816
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,806
Scott: Yeah, I like the polar bear television set is a stuffed polar bear with a television and it's.

817
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:29,050
Scott: I think that's my favorite one.

818
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:29,713
Scott: That's definitely.

819
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:30,516
Scott: that was the first one.

820
00:50:30,596 --> 00:50:31,861
Scott: It was the most obvious.

821
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:37,570
Scott: but audience is that for I mean I could see like I think you're supposed to use it like a kids room, you know to make like a cute TV.

822
00:50:37,711 --> 00:50:39,930
Scott: But they already have like, you know the Mickey Mouse TV or whatever.

823
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:44,691
Scott: I guess I could see that being you're gonna get any television just put a cute bezel on it It's not.

824
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:50,524
Rym: I could see that being in the like den of some sort of ultra modern fancy apartment.

825
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:51,586
Rym: just cuz it's weird.

826
00:50:51,606 --> 00:50:56,645
Scott: I Being in like the safari lodge as the TV set cuz it fits in.

827
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:57,448
Scott: there's that wrist.

828
00:50:57,468 --> 00:50:58,972
Rym: cell phone There's.

829
00:50:59,033 --> 00:51:06,683
Rym: it's like this wrist like holster for your cell phone But the pictures of it show someone putting an entire freaking iPhone in there.

830
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:08,067
Rym: Yeah, it's like gigantic.

831
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:08,669
Rym: It's like a wrist.

832
00:51:08,689 --> 00:51:12,421
Scott: brace On my iPhone might be wider than my wrist.

833
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:14,450
Rym: Let me say mine is a lot wider.

834
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,116
Scott: Yeah, mine is definitely wider than my wrist.

835
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:17,140
Scott: Look you can see it.

836
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:19,448
Rym: My pre is even wider than my wrist.

837
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:20,698
Rym: granted I have tiny wrists.

838
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:23,113
Scott: I also have a very tiny wrist One.

839
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:23,475
Rym: I don't get.

840
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:24,078
Rym: that's on here.

841
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:26,190
Rym: It looks like a good idea.

842
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:32,870
Rym: It's a tiny DV camera that police officers can wear like on their chest to record everything they're doing.

843
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:34,114
Scott: That's good.

844
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:34,997
Scott: Yeah, that's great.

845
00:51:35,418 --> 00:51:39,110
Rym: However, the company that makes it they called it the ghost scam.

846
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:43,768
Scott: Okay Not a very good name.

847
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:45,876
Scott: Sure, it's not like the ghost cam.

848
00:51:46,097 --> 00:51:47,221
Rym: It says go scam.

849
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:51,034
Rym: It just has really really bad Graphic design.

850
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:51,475
Rym: on the ad.

851
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:55,770
Rym: it shows like this really old cop standing there with the thing kind of like photoshopped onto his.

852
00:51:56,482 --> 00:51:58,877
Rym: It's bad But the product I feel like.

853
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:04,309
Rym: by law every police officer on active duty should have a camera recording everything They do while they're on duty except maybe peeing.

854
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,752
Scott: hmm Okay.

855
00:52:06,992 --> 00:52:12,349
Rym: Yeah, I don't have a lot else to talk about CES why a lot of things went down at CES.

856
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,718
Scott: You can go read all about him on the internet.

857
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:15,300
Scott: Yep.

858
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,665
Rym: 3d was making a big jump.

859
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:17,729
Scott: Let's talk about some 3d.

860
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:23,088
Rym: Let's talk about that because Nvidia has been on the 3d boat forever, but no one knows.

861
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:27,130
Scott: that's one You know, they're looking for any area in which they can sell you something new.

862
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:33,678
Scott: It's like well if everyone if we can get everyone to start making 3d games and you need an Nvidia card to play those games In 3d at least.

863
00:52:33,939 --> 00:52:36,370
Scott: then we will be able to sell a lot of Nvidia product, you know.

864
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:38,158
Scott: And then we can also sell glasses.

865
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:40,349
Scott: Well, you know, that's they're looking for.

866
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:48,250
Scott: As far as 3d goes I think that the you know Like people are liking it right now because it is pretty awesome.

867
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:51,319
Scott: You know If you're if you're the kind of person that it doesn't make you sick.

868
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:55,013
Scott: and even the thing is even people who complain about it Making them sick.

869
00:52:55,735 --> 00:52:56,338
Scott: They go see it.

870
00:52:56,398 --> 00:52:57,863
Scott: Anyway, they say oh man, it was awesome.

871
00:52:57,884 --> 00:52:58,666
Scott: But I got nauseous.

872
00:52:58,747 --> 00:52:59,570
Scott: I would you do it again?

873
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,828
Scott: Yeah, it's like okay.

874
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:04,678
Scott: and second of all People already have glasses.

875
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:07,250
Scott: It's sort of problematic for them to wear other glasses.

876
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,521
Rym: Yeah That's why they always make the things really big and you stick them in front.

877
00:53:10,561 --> 00:53:11,806
Scott: and then there's the like.

878
00:53:11,907 --> 00:53:16,426
Scott: I've never been to one That has these but some people go to the ones that have like the battery-powered glasses.

879
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:17,450
Rym: Oh, yeah, there's the shit.

880
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,434
Rym: Well, there's shutter glass.

881
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:19,619
Scott: I've never used those ones.

882
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:20,925
Rym: There's the polarized ones.

883
00:53:20,945 --> 00:53:22,110
Rym: There's the red and blue ones.

884
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,210
Scott: There's a people talked about like the ones of the batteries.

885
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,670
Scott: I was like what the hell are you talking about?

886
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:28,259
Scott: I've never seen one of the battery in my life But I guess they exist.

887
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,997
Rym: people have said that those Give you the most options.

888
00:53:31,017 --> 00:53:33,450
Rym: like you can make the best 3d with the shutter glasses.

889
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:34,675
Scott: But how do you like?

890
00:53:35,036 --> 00:53:37,527
Scott: if it's so it it's shuttering open and closed all the time.

891
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:38,230
Scott: Is that what it's doing?

892
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:40,922
Rym: Yes, so fast that basically so so you can.

893
00:53:40,982 --> 00:53:42,589
Rym: it synchronizes with the screen.

894
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:43,955
Scott: Oh, so there's no.

895
00:53:44,115 --> 00:53:46,304
Scott: so you don't see black see something.

896
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:46,966
Scott: don't see something.

897
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:47,870
Scott: see something don't see something.

898
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:51,847
Rym: No, it flickers so fast that it like imagine does it make noise while it's flickering like?

899
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:52,449
Rym: I don't know.

900
00:53:52,811 --> 00:53:53,334
Rym: Imagine this.

901
00:53:53,636 --> 00:53:53,938
Rym: imagine.

902
00:53:53,958 --> 00:54:05,250
Rym: you've got a screen to say 120 Hertz Mm-hmm, and the shutter glasses are going in each eye at 120 Hertz offset And then the screen is flipping between the two images that together create the 3d in your eyes.

903
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,377
Scott: Synchronize the glasses with the projector.

904
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,164
Rym: I think there's a way to do that.

905
00:54:09,184 --> 00:54:10,630
Rym: I mean, I don't know a lot about the technology.

906
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:11,114
Scott: Yeah, it's.

907
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:13,370
Scott: and then you know, I like the ones without the battery.

908
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:17,808
Rym: There are also a lot of multiple demos of different technologies of glasses free 3d.

909
00:54:18,953 --> 00:54:21,727
Rym: Of course the consensus so far has been that it's not that 3d.

910
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:24,356
Rym: Yeah, and it's kind of blurry.

911
00:54:24,497 --> 00:54:31,238
Scott: basically what seems to have happened here right is that Panasonic had a 3d TV Right with an actual release date.

912
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,088
Scott: Everyone else is sort of like yeah, we're gonna do 3d.

913
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,430
Rym: Well, because all the technology manufacturers realize that look at Avatar.

914
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,874
Rym: Look how crazy it is in the theaters.

915
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:42,061
Rym: Even if people pirate the movie.

916
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:49,343
Rym: They want to go into the theater to see the awesome 3d Mmm, once people have 3d TVs that gimmick disappears.

917
00:54:49,664 --> 00:54:51,350
Scott: something else really interesting is that?

918
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:56,185
Scott: Apparently like it doesn't cost that much to add 3d to the TV.

919
00:54:56,285 --> 00:54:57,550
Scott: It's they can just sort of tack it on.

920
00:54:57,674 --> 00:55:06,038
Scott: Yeah So if they can do something like that to sell everyone a new TV that they just sold them HD TVs Big money for them.

921
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:08,170
Rym: I wish this was gonna happen a little bit sooner.

922
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,557
Rym: I would wait until the 3d wave starts.

923
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:13,645
Rym: my I'd buy the best 2d TV money could buy.

924
00:55:13,725 --> 00:55:24,048
Scott: a guy at work was looking actually a Projectors and he said that there was a 1080p Projector with 3d abilities that was actually cheaper than a 1080p projector that didn't have 3d.

925
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:29,930
Rym: The only reason I didn't I'm not getting a projector just yet Is that a 52 inch TV is as big as I need in the room.

926
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:32,442
Rym: Anyway a projector would just be overkill.

927
00:55:32,683 --> 00:55:37,950
Scott: also a projector is very annoying You see to put all the equipment in the back and then get the wiring and the pain.

928
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,230
Rym: That would be fine because I wouldn't put anything in the front.

929
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,015
Rym: I don't have a we.

930
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:43,170
Scott: I guess there'd be nothing in the front.

931
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:49,030
Rym: The problems are one the blacks aren't that black and I'm not gonna get that expensive Sony thing with the black screen.

932
00:55:49,331 --> 00:55:50,994
Scott: I don't even know if that's still around anymore.

933
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,240
Rym: There's got to be somewhere or that technology and to the bulbs do burn out.

934
00:55:55,341 --> 00:56:03,277
Rym: So you basically you need to have a projector and a TV and you only use the projector for like movies and the TV for Like playing my video games.

935
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:09,035
Scott: Maybe personally like I'm not you know, I'm only partially excited about 3d.

936
00:56:09,055 --> 00:56:17,854
Scott: It's like yeah It would be pretty cool if I could watch like a hockey in 3d But I'm not gonna pay money for that for a very long time.

937
00:56:17,914 --> 00:56:21,559
Scott: However, however glasses Imagine it's like I gotta buy all these glasses.

938
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:26,615
Rym: I'm playing an FPS that just has natural 3d while you're playing.

939
00:56:26,796 --> 00:56:26,996
Scott: Yeah.

940
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,643
Scott: Yeah be pretty good Wouldn't?

941
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:36,458
Rym: I wouldn't spend $1,000 on it, but I'm not gonna buy all new monitors Yeah, but what I would do is I would just upgrade when it was time to upgrade and I'd get 3d.

942
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,121
Rym: Yeah,

943
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:56,000
Scott: I foresee, you know, it's like they're being a big 3d push now, but remember the initial HD push right was Like in the late 90s, right and it wasn't until like the late 2000s that eight, you know Everyone's got HD or at least a lot of people have HD and not even the majority have it yet.

944
00:56:56,421 --> 00:57:01,580
Scott: So and no one cares about blu-ray or anything and a lot of people are putting standard def content into their HD TVs.

945
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:07,258
Scott: So I think it'll be probably 10 years before before a lot of people actually have 3d.

946
00:57:08,223 --> 00:57:11,783
Scott: you know as many as have HD now and Before.

947
00:57:11,823 --> 00:57:16,320
Scott: there's like a standard and there's a lot of actual, you know 3d content.

948
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:29,956
Rym: The real drive right now like all the trends are toward digital distribution distribution That is going to take precedence over even high def and I think a lot of people are more interested in getting media easier Than getting high quality media.

949
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:35,680
Rym: Mmm, I mean look how you know people watch entire movies and TV shows on YouTube.

950
00:57:36,282 --> 00:57:38,669
Rym: Yeah, people are willing to put up with really bad quality.

951
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:42,060
Rym: They just want the content and they're not even willing to pay for the content.

952
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:48,616
Scott: Yeah, they're much more excited about a boxy box than they are about day TV a goat seat projector.

953
00:57:48,878 --> 00:57:58,210
Rym: Yeah This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
