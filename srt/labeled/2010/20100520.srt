1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,775
Rym: Hey, it's Thursday, May 20th.

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:20,199
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight one of the most important things in all of human civilization That has brought us from the depths of bread.

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:30,720
Scott: Let's do this Way to go Rym the manly.

4
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,548
Rym: I see I feel weird if we just say bread.

5
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:34,170
Rym: It's too short.

6
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,460
Rym: You know the music comes in.

7
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:36,569
Scott: we're gonna know that's not it.

8
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:37,800
Scott: Oh, you know you're bullshitting.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,884
Scott: you told me two seconds ago It was because like you couldn't figure out how to get the opener to sound better.

10
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:45,549
Scott: your technological failure.

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,578
Rym: now It's more.

12
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:47,870
Rym: It's just a cadence fail.

13
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:52,341
Rym: You know if you say the opening and it's too short in GeekNights Then the music sounds weird.

14
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:57,625
Rym: if you come to cut it off right away And if you let it go on too long after that it also sounds weird because you said so little.

15
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:00,278
Scott: I'm sure there is a. This is a false dichotomy.

16
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:02,130
Scott: There is a. there is a third solution.

17
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:03,053
Rym: I think it just.

18
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:07,269
Rym: it's fine, and you're just weirdly oversensitive to things that you find corny.

19
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:08,056
Rym: We're not.

20
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:09,348
Rym: we're not doing the show on stool.

21
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:11,798
Rym: You laughed at that.

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,444
Scott: you left.

23
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:14,754
Scott: That's a Poop.

24
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:20,730
Scott: joke is like the opposite of corny unless of course there was corn in the poop which is a totally different situation.

25
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:39,410
Rym: So all that aside I realized you know we did the show last night, and there's an there's an anecdote in my life That is it's very rare that I ever have an opportunity to use it in any capacity Because the situation the setup for it basically can't happen anymore, and it's such a specific.

26
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,758
Rym: So I what are you talking about?

27
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,070
Rym: so in the last show we're talking about command and conquer and like RTS's and things right.

28
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,116
Rym: So when I had command and conquer this is this is a witty ball Mo from early Rym.

29
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:56,382
Rym: I was playing with my friend in high school And he was using the old 486 in our house And I had the Pentium Pro with a null modem between him.

30
00:01:56,944 --> 00:02:05,350
Rym: now the Pentium Pro was fine But the 486 had a trouble where sometimes the mouse driver Which is freaked the fuck out and the mouse would go all over the place, and you couldn't do anything.

31
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:07,457
Rym: So we flipped coins.

32
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,687
Rym: he got the 486 and we started to play.

33
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:10,330
Rym: command and conquer.

34
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,783
Scott: Do you ever have a boot disk that was like mouse dot exe followed by the game?

35
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:14,325
Rym: Yep?

36
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:16,351
Rym: That's how I ran doom 2.

37
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:18,296
Rym: Okay, or sometimes I hold f5 to boot.

38
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:23,549
Rym: type mouse dot exe then type high mem then type mem maker then type doom 2 dot exe.

39
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,869
Rym: Sometimes I often would not load the sound card driver if I was playing multiplayer because it slowed me down too much.

40
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:40,810
Rym: So we're playing and in the middle of the game You know a game of command and conquer the mouse bugs out on him And there's no way to fix it short of reboot, so he says Rym what the fuck.

41
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:47,989
Rym: How am I supposed to play command and conquer if the shitty ass computer's mouse just breaks, and I said well I guess your only option is to conquer.

42
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:59,682
Rym: Since he couldn't command anymore I thought it was great And I had to get that out because I will rarely have times in my life where I can ever even get you like you Took the corny pills this morning.

43
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:00,469
Scott: I think that's what happened.

44
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:02,377
Rym: Well, we'll see this afternoon.

45
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:03,784
Rym: It's it's.

46
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:08,075
Scott: it's already like 6 p.m All right captain.

47
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:11,589
Rym: so what do you got for me in this Thursday front half of GeekNights?

48
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:11,970
Scott: Nothing.

49
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:12,915
Scott: It's so boring.

50
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:14,040
Rym: There's plenty of stuff on the internet.

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,723
Rym: You're just jaded.

52
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:15,768
Scott: There's nothing.

53
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:18,299
Scott: anyway I could tell you a weird story about the subway.

54
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,870
Rym: It doesn't involve a fat and/or crazy lady.

55
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:24,164
Scott: No, it was actually just one of those slightly weird situations.

56
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:31,029
Scott: You know we're standing on the subway I'm playing some game on my iPhone and suddenly a couple of people are like whoa whoa.

57
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:32,157
Rym: So there was.

58
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:32,823
Rym: there was a hubbub.

59
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:33,609
Rym: there was a hubbub.

60
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,390
Scott: I turn around and like this you know I'm trying to figure out what's going on.

61
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:44,065
Scott: But apparently they're paying attention to this girl Who looks like she's just hugging this dude that she was with and I think they would.

62
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:54,903
Scott: those two people were talking when I got on the subway, so I was like uh But apparently like she had some seizure or something And she just like leaned on the guy and then she was better.

63
00:03:54,923 --> 00:04:00,970
Scott: yeah, that's sort of thing gonna happen Yeah, but then it was all like the two people who were involved.

64
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,890
Scott: You know the the dude and the girl who like had the problem were all like making nothing of it.

65
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:13,443
Scott: They were like yeah, whatever and that some other people were like you should go the hospital, dude Probably and they're just like whatever.

66
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:14,229
Scott: It's all good.

67
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:18,630
Rym: I mean if they have a problem that they have under control then they probably know exactly what they need to do.

68
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,072
Rym: I'm sure this has happened to them before yeah But it's like.

69
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:28,774
Scott: you know she got off the subway and was all wobbly and it was just like uh It's really not a problem Are you sure?

70
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,629
Rym: well at least you know it does speak of New Yorkers and the whole people.

71
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:35,020
Rym: Despite the common perception of New York City people basically jump.

72
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:40,677
Rym: if there's any excuse for a hubbub to happen and for someone to be The good guy like a hundred people are jump on it.

73
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:48,410
Scott: It's pretty yeah, I mean, it's it's like people mind their own business Unless there's a problem in which case they want to fix it.

74
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,105
Scott: You know and the thing is quite often people are stupid like remember.

75
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,069
Scott: This is very similar story.

76
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,420
Rym: I think I know which one you're gonna train.

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,089
Rym: when the woman's like friend was having a heart attack or something She went to go pull the emergency brake.

78
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:04,588
Scott: No, no the one where you had like the weird guy who wouldn't tell what was wrong with the woman.

79
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:07,609
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah, that was even worse.

80
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,139
Scott: Yeah, same kind of thing those were.

81
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:10,982
Rym: you know where the dude was?

82
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:13,152
Rym: just you know with a girl who was kind of moaning in Pain.

83
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:15,305
Rym: and then when someone asked him like hey, is she all right?

84
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:16,010
Rym: Do you need any help?

85
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:16,935
Rym: He was like man.

86
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:17,579
Rym: mind your business.

87
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:18,565
Rym: Just leave us alone.

88
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:27,650
Rym: mind your business Yeah, which immediately aroused the suspicion of everyone in the world And the guy just got more and more loud and angry the more people tried to help out.

89
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,835
Scott: This guy wasn't loud and angry.

90
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,410
Scott: They were just sort of quiet and like whatever, but it was still weird.

91
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:38,534
Rym: Yeah, well you know it brings me back to when we were in colony, and that's the biggest thing I miss about college.

92
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:41,385
Rym: isn't so much the clubs the hanging out or the infinite free time.

93
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:52,407
Rym: no responsibility I miss all those things But I miss living in a world where just random crazy bullshit will happen to you like you know coming home one day And there's just a couch out of fire in front of the door.

94
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,312
Scott: That was.

95
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:58,894
Scott: that was at night while we were sitting in our you know Apartment.

96
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:04,089
Rym: I remember the next morning when I go out And there's the skeletons of a couch out there because they hadn't gotten rid of it.

97
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:05,498
Scott: yet What did you think would be out there?

98
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:06,384
Rym: I don't know.

99
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:08,353
Rym: maybe they'd moved it Maybe two couches.

100
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:18,070
Rym: what would have been funny if there was another couch unburned and the burn couch was gone Like a practical joke or maybe a Phoenix Phoenix couch.

101
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:21,999
Scott: So I think you know you know couch.

102
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:36,989
Rym: I Think it is worth noting at least that today was in fact the much controversial Draw Muhammad day or everybody draw Muhammad day Which seems to have drawn a Facebook group for it and an equally large Facebook group against it.

103
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:40,661
Rym: People in Pakistan lost their shit and Pakistan like banned face.

104
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:43,670
Scott: none of the other Muslim countries lost their shit I don't know.

105
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,079
Rym: I think.

106
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,557
Rym: one Pakistan is more Actually has internet.

107
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:55,849
Rym: Yeah, yeah that I think that's one big part of it and to Pakistan is probably not as good at covering up dissent as say Saudi Arabia or Iran.

108
00:06:56,652 --> 00:07:02,835
Scott: Mmm, and three Pakistan was video of this lady driving a car in Saudi Arabia Which she's not allowed to do.

109
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,990
Scott: yeah, because she's you know has boobs and vagina.

110
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,879
Scott: Yeah, that is against law.

111
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,470
Rym: I also have boobs, but not having a vagina is key.

112
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,006
Scott: It's against the law there, but she did it anyway, and there's a video.

113
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:14,409
Scott: It's pretty cool.

114
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:18,684
Rym: She just driving around like like you do at least like you should be able to do.

115
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:24,060
Rym: yeah, but also Pakistan I think a couple years ago banned YouTube for a while.

116
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,330
Scott: Yeah, didn't they break YouTube because someone fucked up the something something.

117
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,445
Rym: Yeah, there was all sorts of weirdness with Pakistan, but now this time they went crazy.

118
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,036
Rym: like they banned Twitter They banned blackberry.

119
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:50,909
Rym: apparently they were blocking blackberry messages into the country and all sorts of craziness at least until the end of the month to Prevent anyone from getting more angry about the fact that people in America and much of the rest of the world where people are free Are drawing pictures of Muhammad like hugging kittens and eating ice cream?

120
00:07:52,972 --> 00:08:08,265
Rym: It's pretty epic though, I wish I would have had time But now that I have a real job where I can't just like BS around at work I wanted to make a Muhammad on the go much in the vein of Lord of the Rings on the go or Prince of Nothing On the go, but I didn't have time to make the seed picture.

121
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:11,744
Rym: so all of you out there Make Muhammad on the go.

122
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:12,690
Rym: you would make me so happy.

123
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,650
Scott: I think what disappoints me the most is that everyone draws Muhammad in sort of a stereotypical way.

124
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:18,699
Scott: It's always like a bearded.

125
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:23,678
Scott: You know you know Skin dark skinned guy with the turban.

126
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,130
Rym: I drew a dot and a cat all right that I called Muhammad.

127
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:33,749
Scott: So I mean people I want to see like like wasp businessman, and then it says Muhammad.

128
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:40,289
Scott: underneath I want to see like you know a little girl in a frilly tutu, and it says Muhammad.

129
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,855
Scott: That's what I want to see right.

130
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:45,648
Scott: I mean why everyone's just sort of you know at the one hand.

131
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,801
Scott: It's like aha We're getting their religion blah blah blah.

132
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:55,443
Scott: We you know we got them, but on the other hand We're just propagating this you know stereotype Which is sort of not.

133
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,450
Rym: well it depends.

134
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,668
Rym: I mean in the very least historically we have a good idea of the vagueness of what Muhammad would have looked like.

135
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:07,090
Scott: yeah Cuz you know Jesus looks a lot like the pictures of Jesus people draw are a lot like what Jesus looked like.

136
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:14,020
Rym: Well the thing is there are there have been pictures of Jesus continuously And they're all influenced heavily by Byzantine art and all that stuff.

137
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,029
Rym: so we lease we know the artistic progression of like kind of.

138
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:20,069
Rym: why That fictional characters portrayed that way.

139
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:25,090
Rym: But with Muhammad like some I mean the problem is some people are just drawing like turban guy.

140
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,204
Scott: Yeah, but I wonder like what if I draw Muhammad?

141
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:31,534
Scott: right, but it's not the Muhammad It's just this guy.

142
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:32,640
Scott: I know his name is Muhammad.

143
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,068
Scott: He works at the bodega.

144
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,056
Rym: well What is another prejudice stereotype?

145
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:42,929
Rym: what I should do is take a picture of Muhammad Ali and say I assert that Muhammad Ali is in fact the reincarnation of the Prophet Muhammad who looks identical to him.

146
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:47,150
Scott: I could just draw Muhammad Ali and then be like aha lol yeah.

147
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:49,195
Scott: Or what if I draw right?

148
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:56,924
Scott: like you know the the the wasp businessman a little girl in a tutu right with boxing gloves and I say Muhammad parentheses Ali.

149
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:00,718
Rym: It's interesting how this you know.

150
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:04,494
Rym: the mainstream media talking about this They didn't have a lot to say.

151
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:08,628
Rym: they mostly focused on the fact that Pakistan lost their shit and the controversy surrounding it.

152
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:16,250
Rym: this Holiday really only existed on the internet where it's a big deal, and I have a feeling it's going to happen every year henceforth.

153
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,998
Scott: Yeah, just right next to talk like a pirate day.

154
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:22,110
Scott: Yeah, maybe we should have talked like Muhammad day.

155
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:24,754
Rym: What would you say?

156
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:26,242
Rym: how about dress like Muhammad day?

157
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:28,113
Scott: I Would be.

158
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:31,897
Scott: I would just wear my normal clothes and be like hey How do we know mom?

159
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,950
Scott: it didn't have awesome geeky t-shirt?

160
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,164
Rym: What is interesting is that it's kind of dressing like my friend Muhammad.

161
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:38,630
Scott: He works at the company on the next floor.

162
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:39,559
Scott: He's also a programmer.

163
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,690
Rym: this can almost be used.

164
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:48,170
Rym: It's gonna cut a lot of cool people off the internet But it's sort of a litmus test of whether or not you can actually engage in a free society.

165
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:59,368
Rym: Because look if the nations where people are so angry about it block all the means of free exchange where these pictures might appear They're basically cutting themselves off from what is the internet?

166
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:04,444
Rym: And I wonder what the consequences of that are going to be 10 or 15 years down the road.

167
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:04,765
Rym: if so

168
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:11,648
Scott: if we if the free Countries just continually to freely express themselves, and they keep doing it a whole bunch and not

169
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:12,150
Rym: just this but

170
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:26,630
Scott: The non free countries will will just keep having being forced to basically you know they won't be able to filter They'll be forced to completely cut themselves off And we'll like split the world into the free world and non free world and the divide will grow.

171
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:30,390
Rym: I mean, I think that's the way to go with China especially I mean Google took the first step.

172
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:36,490
Rym: But imagine if bit by bit no no outside entity in the world would kowtow to China's censorship demands.

173
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:38,081
Scott: They wouldn't have an internet.

174
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:39,430
Scott: They would have intranet of China.

175
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:49,264
Rym: Yep, now the thing is China scarily is at least technically competent enough to have a reasonably workable national firewall Which is kind of sad, but that's cuz Cisco did it for them.

176
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:53,748
Scott: It wasn't China being smart It was paid someone you know a zillion dollars to do it.

177
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:55,770
Rym: So I don't know it.

178
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:57,290
Rym: I just it was worth mentioning.

179
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:10,179
Rym: I don't want to turn the whole show into a Muhammad show though I will note right now that if you're watching the you stream that is not in fact Rym and Scott But it is the exact representation of Muhammad sitting next to Muhammad Talking into microphones.

180
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:11,770
Rym: Oh, and I'm drinking alcohol.

181
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,115
Scott: I think we need you know.

182
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:17,855
Scott: I mean the you stream is awesome and everything and it's it's helping us out and more people are Watching it, but I want to.

183
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:19,302
Scott: I don't want to interact with it.

184
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,412
Rym: cuz then it's like we're never You know.

185
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:23,555
Scott: because it's like.

186
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:28,008
Scott: then the people who most people isn't the podcast just that doesn't.

187
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:28,750
Scott: it's not good for them.

188
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:29,910
Scott: It's the same way.

189
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,238
Scott: I don't like to do stuff that Acknowledges the community or the forum or anything.

190
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:35,225
Scott: cuz then people most people aren't in that.

191
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,170
Scott: so if they listen to the show and we Do that all the time it really makes them outsiders.

192
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:46,623
Scott: I guess some of them will you know take that as a clue and join in but most of them will just be like turned Away, well one way to handle that.

193
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:47,570
Rym: I guess you know it's Thursday.

194
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:51,010
Rym: We talk about whatever we want instead of you know sequestering it all in the meta moment.

195
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:52,796
Rym: I feel like the best way to handle that.

196
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:58,310
Rym: if you have the you know the resources to make all the media you want to Make is to have your real thing.

197
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:05,890
Rym: You know like GeekNights the show and then independently you have like one other show that is the community show that's focused at those people.

198
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:11,010
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean this is what stack like if we did the couch Which is the video of us hanging out on the couch?

199
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:19,710
Scott: This is what Stack Overflow learned right is they made Stack Overflow and the thing was is a lot of people would make post questions on Stack Overflow about Stack Overflow.

200
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:24,076
Scott: They'd be like should Stack Overflow Changed this to work this way.

201
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:27,990
Scott: right and the thing is people who come to Stack Overflow itself.

202
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,321
Scott: They're not supposed to be talking about Stack Overflow.

203
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,270
Scott: They're coming to get help with their technical problem.

204
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:39,906
Scott: So eventually they made meta that Stack Overflow Which is a Stack Overflow for Stack Overflow and nothing else right to talk about.

205
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:40,969
Scott: it's that right and?

206
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:48,748
Scott: Keeping the meta separate from the actual thing is incredibly important because the meta 99% people don't care about that.

207
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:53,710
Scott: yeah I mean like all our listeners who are in the put it in the face of the people who don't care about it at all.

208
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:57,710
Scott: Right then it really makes your thing shittier.

209
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:05,155
Rym: There has to be a big separation between the meta and the thing which is also kind of a shout-out now to all of you Listeners who aren't in our.

210
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,845
Rym: you know the GeekNights community in the forum and all that BS.

211
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:14,109
Rym: because you know our Hardcore listeners the ones that hang out in our forums always ask us things like why didn't you do a show on X?

212
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,949
Rym: You know we all want a show on X And they'll all talk about like do this do this do this do that.

213
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:26,965
Rym: But the emails we get from all you guys and the interaction with them like the majority of the listeners is Very different from them and you guys want very different things.

214
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:27,790
Rym: as far as I can tell.

215
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:46,270
Scott: Yeah, you know you see the same pattern over and over again like uh you know people on the internet They complain about X. You know, but 99% of the people don't say anything and you know what they want the opposite of X. or You know everyone says oh Nintendo do this, but what sells you like we fit which nobody wanted right?

216
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,670
Rym: We fits not a bad game the thing is what bothers me about it.

217
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,450
Rym: The only thing that bothers me about it is that DDR is a much better exercise platform.

218
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:57,820
Scott: It's not about real exercise about pretend to exercise.

219
00:14:58,121 --> 00:14:59,966
Scott: you wouldn't be able to sell real exercise.

220
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:00,709
Scott: It wouldn't be fun.

221
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,008
Scott: It would hurt the fat people.

222
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,856
Scott: Plus you know DDR is not accessible.

223
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:06,639
Scott: It's very difficult.

224
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,565
Rym: Yeah, it always amazing.

225
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:09,167
Scott: anyone can do.

226
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:11,436
Rym: step on the things I always kind of forget.

227
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:26,379
Rym: You know we've been playing DDR for like a decade and yet You know like Emily's playing DDR again now that we've got to set up in the apartment and everything and you know watching her learn and progress like through like a one foot to a two foot to a three foot to a four foot and Reminded me of how much of my life.

228
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,967
Rym: I kind of invested in DDR.

229
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,521
Scott: It's it's how much you fell under the spell of DDR.

230
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,550
Scott: you allowed the computer to infect your brain.

231
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:41,370
Rym: Well regardless your body in one way or another I spent a scary amount of time mastering that skill.

232
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:44,926
Scott: Yeah anyway, yeah.

233
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:47,957
Scott: So I want to talk about.

234
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:52,799
Scott: so I get there's so much tech stuff going on especially with the Google I/o that I got to offload some of it to today.

235
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,366
Rym: Oh, no it is Thursday.

236
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:54,607
Rym: Well.

237
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:56,735
Rym: You know affectionately I like to call Thursday the lounge.

238
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,541
Rym: whatever like that whatever.

239
00:15:58,561 --> 00:15:59,625
Rym: that thinks everything's corny.

240
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:00,649
Scott: You're being real corny.

241
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,610
Scott: right now I can tell you that you're being like ultra corny.

242
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:04,595
Scott: So there's this problem.

243
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:12,070
Scott: that was basically the problem of Google accounts that has existed for a long time And it goes something like this right you have a Google account.

244
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,693
Scott: It's your you know.

245
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:16,190
Scott: use it for Gmail use it for reader use it for wave use it for everything.

246
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,481
Scott: That's Google all right, and then you have Google apps.

247
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:25,870
Scott: because you don't want your email address to be at gmail.com You want it to be at your own domain.com, so you get Google app which is still already.

248
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,833
Rym: That's the minority of.

249
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:30,184
Scott: yeah, Google apps is meant for schools or offices.

250
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:34,564
Scott: right can get their own private Google So they can use all the Google stuff, but it's their own right.

251
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:35,770
Scott: so we have one of those.

252
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,703
Scott: It's totally sweet, and you get.

253
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:38,146
Scott: you know.

254
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:43,750
Scott: you get You know mail and Doc's and calendar and all you know all the good stuff is in there.

255
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,619
Rym: I mean like all the front row crew.

256
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,708
Rym: people have front row crew email address.

257
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:56,558
Scott: the problem Is is right like I'll go and I'll try to use like some Android phone or something and it'll be like yeah You want to use Google latitude.

258
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:59,270
Scott: give us your Google account, and I can't use my apps account.

259
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:00,778
Scott: I got to use the regular one.

260
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:02,085
Rym: a couple of things were smart now.

261
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:03,010
Scott: I got two accounts.

262
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,027
Scott: It's like ah fuck me.

263
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,569
Rym: Yeah, a couple of things were smart and if I put in the full address with the at they would figure it out.

264
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,675
Rym: But most things would not.

265
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:13,050
Rym: especially Google made things yeah like Google reader.

266
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:14,935
Scott: You can't use my app.

267
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:15,116
Scott: good.

268
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:16,701
Scott: There's no reader in apps right.

269
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:23,396
Scott: all we want is to be able to use our Google apps Account with all the Google stuff And I won't need a regular Google.

270
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:25,203
Rym: is I got to get rid of my old gmail account?

271
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:28,057
Scott: even stuff like feed burner or Google Analytics or ad.

272
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:30,050
Scott: where to be YouTube yeah?

273
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,474
Scott: I gotta have like these separate account.

274
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:36,572
Rym: our YouTube is associated with some bullshit account that I made a long time ago to set up YouTube.

275
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:40,068
Scott: yeah, so I think they've made some progress in fixing it.

276
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:42,160
Scott: for example They just added wave rights now.

277
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,703
Scott: We have you know we got front-row crew wave But from what I can tell front-row crew wave is just wave and I can totally it.

278
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,092
Scott: totally you know mixes in with the actual Wave.

279
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,550
Scott: just fine, so I never need to use the other account on wave.

280
00:17:54,671 --> 00:18:03,719
Scott: I can use my front-row crew account on wave and it's all good, and I logged into something else I think it might have been calendar or Docs And it said which account do you want to use?

281
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,470
Scott: and it said this one or the front-row crew one?

282
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,516
Scott: And I was like oh my God I've never seen this before.

283
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:15,326
Scott: so I think there they might be Spreading that out across the board, and I hope that I can one day like try to use.

284
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:20,947
Scott: you know Google I don't know feed burner And it'll say which account you're actually what I really want to use.

285
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:21,570
Rym: I want to wait.

286
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,977
Rym: I want to talk about this a lot on Monday.

287
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:31,027
Rym: Is that Google predictive engine Google voice Google latitude Google Google predictive that I really want access to that, but they're not going to give it to me.

288
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:31,790
Rym: I'm a terrible coder.

289
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:33,661
Scott: Well, you can just get it right.

290
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:34,566
Rym: I mean no there.

291
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,250
Rym: It's right now.

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,241
Rym: It's super invite only and it's kind of like you know.

293
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:38,569
Rym: propose like what do you want to do with it?

294
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:40,869
Scott: And I don't know what are you gonna do with it?

295
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:42,334
Rym: I got some ideas.

296
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:48,397
Rym: basically I want to put in stock market data and see what it predicts in a black box Whatever that.

297
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,650
Rym: and I want to put in listener.

298
00:18:49,771 --> 00:19:02,350
Rym: I want to put in basically listener numbers from GeekNights right because I can Export that from the feed burner and the libsyn and everything and I want to compare it to The titles of the episodes and the text of the thing and see if there any weird correlations.

299
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:03,213
Scott: Mmm.

300
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:04,099
Scott: That's not a bad idea.

301
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,321
Scott: Yes.

302
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:05,630
Rym: I want to just do cool stuff like that.

303
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,614
Rym: I mean, it's just an API.

304
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:10,006
Rym: I can write little Python apps to like interact with it, but we'll see.

305
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:10,648
Rym: maybe I'll get in.

306
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:20,368
Rym: So to get back on track.

307
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,940
Rym: I think we're derailing a little bit things of the day.

308
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,227
Rym: I tried to say that as corny as possible.

309
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,155
Scott: Are you trying to be corny gray?

310
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:28,857
Rym: Yeah now I am.

311
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:37,260
Scott: You know like I have to in response to your anti corn You want to read some some like Marvel two-in-one?

312
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:39,907
Scott: 80s and 70s and whatever.

313
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:42,700
Rym: so you got a thing of the day for me because I got something pretty amazing here.

314
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
Scott: Yeah, I just want to you know, I couldn't really find an awesome thing a day.

315
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,602
Scott: But I just want to you know remind people that in the California far away from here All right.

316
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:57,613
Scott: this weekend May 22 and 23 is the Maker Faire Which is you know, always the awesome.

317
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:02,949
Scott: if you want to see Shit people made in you know, the Arduino.

318
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:04,112
Scott: is it full of corn?

319
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:08,285
Scott: make magazine boing boing kind of style Of making stuff.

320
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:11,020
Scott: then you want to go to the Maker Faire.

321
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:17,900
Scott: It's in San Mateo County event center from 10 to 8 on Saturday and 10 to 6 on Sunday.

322
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:21,820
Rym: It is funny how that kind of really does define a genre of making.

323
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:25,340
Scott: This is like the one kind of thing that we don't have here, right?

324
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,480
Scott: It's like we've got comic cons, you know, even though San Diego's out west we got New York.

325
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,584
Scott: We got some other ones, right?

326
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:31,608
Scott: We got anime cons.

327
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:32,290
Scott: We go to con.

328
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:33,374
Scott: we got gaming.

329
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:39,111
Scott: now that we got PAX East and such We don't have like a Maker Faire in the east or things like burning.

330
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:39,633
Scott: Oh, no way.

331
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:45,083
Scott: It says world Maker Faire, New York City 2010.

332
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,112
Scott: Wait, I gotta go look at this.

333
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:52,853
Scott: Whoa, wait, okay September 25 and 26 at New York Hall of Science.

334
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:53,436
Scott: Oh crap.

335
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:54,360
Scott: I guess we're going to that.

336
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,251
Scott: Yeah, there's a double thing of the day.

337
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,177
Rym: Not bad.

338
00:20:57,237 --> 00:21:00,192
Scott: When is The New York comic-con.

339
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:01,760
Rym: I think it's October.

340
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:10,481
Scott: It's October, okay, it's soon after the world Maker Faire, but okay, we're going to the world Maker Faire, New York City 2010.

341
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:20,530
Rym: so In Philadelphia an event happened that will basically settle anytime you ever argue like, you know I'm from Detroit and the cops are real hardcore there now.

342
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,252
Rym: I'm from LA.

343
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:23,200
Rym: the cops like we'll just beat you up for nothing there.

344
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:24,638
Scott: Well, no, what do you mean?

345
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,161
Scott: We're not.

346
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,210
Scott: we don't care how how tough the cops are.

347
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:32,347
Scott: we care how disgusting the people are and we know that in Things Philadelphia has the most disgusting thing.

348
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,654
Rym: Uh, I would take issue with that.

349
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:36,439
Scott: Who do you think is more disgusting Oakland?

350
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:40,526
Scott: What's wrong with Oakland?

351
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:42,073
Rym: the Raiders mostly.

352
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,017
Scott: so that's it.

353
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:50,244
Rym: so anyway Philadelphia actually wins this fight because there was a situation and this is my thing of the day Just the whole.

354
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:51,653
Rym: you can read the entire story.

355
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:52,538
Rym: I will summarize it.

356
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:57,213
Rym: There's a group of people who are members of an organization that they called move.

357
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:05,923
Rym: in the end of the 70s a bunch of them were arrested after a shootout that ended with a police officer dying and nine of them went to jail.

358
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:12,779
Rym: and the ones who didn't go to jail moved to Philadelphia moved to her neighborhood bought a house and Preceded to be jackasses.

359
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,650
Rym: They fortified it.

360
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:16,420
Rym: they stocked up supplies.

361
00:22:16,861 --> 00:22:21,593
Rym: They had loudspeakers that 24/7 played weird like anarchist propaganda.

362
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:36,779
Rym: They built like steel bunkers on the roof and Basically the stench from this place coupled with the severe health hazard and the rats and everything what was coming to a head Mmm, so Philadelphia police went to deal with that.

363
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,552
Rym: I'm gonna fast-forward through the part that you can read on Wikipedia.

364
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:42,940
Rym: They bombed the entire city block.

365
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,787
Rym: Everything burned down.

366
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:48,360
Scott: they fucking way with an airplane that had a bomb that falling out of it.

367
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,933
Scott: So they basically they just walked in.

368
00:22:50,953 --> 00:23:01,765
Rym: they put a bomb on the ground and wine trouble Evacuated the entire city block the night before saying yeah take a change of clothes We're gonna get rid of those jerks and then you can come back in the morning you know the next day.

369
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:15,767
Rym: and then there was a shootout and During this a police helicopter or something like that with a guy who had made a bomb officially out of c4 a large amount of c4 a Surprising amount of c4.

370
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,737
Scott: they don't take that much at c4.

371
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,860
Rym: They dropped it on top of the building to blow up the bunkers so they could then finish the gunfight.

372
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,100
Rym: The bomb blew up much of the building and set the rest of it on fire.

373
00:23:27,702 --> 00:23:29,909
Rym: The fire spread to the entire city block.

374
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,214
Scott: So the bomb wasn't.

375
00:23:31,414 --> 00:23:32,197
Scott: they didn't make a bomb.

376
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:32,980
Scott: That was too big.

377
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:34,446
Rym: So the bomb was too big.

378
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:35,672
Scott: the fire was too big.

379
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:39,595
Scott: The bomb was also too big But the explosion isn't what got the rest of the block.

380
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:42,551
Rym: It was the fire no, but yeah, yes, but the explosion spread.

381
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:51,736
Rym: the fire caused the fire and Despite all the fire department hanging out right there So the fire department tried to fight the fire and the people inside kept shooting at them.

382
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,509
Rym: Oh so I.

383
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:58,393
Scott: Why didn't they use poison gas right with poison?

384
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,560
Rym: Yeah, they already fired tear gas at the building.

385
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:00,981
Rym: That's not.

386
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:03,870
Scott: I mean poison gas like you're right.

387
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:04,392
Scott: Yeah.

388
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:05,495
Scott: I mean you're shooting at them.

389
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:06,839
Rym: You're already children in there.

390
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,065
Scott: You're already shooting at them.

391
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:11,153
Scott: You're already trying to murder the women and children.

392
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:12,900
Scott: I murdered them too, right?

393
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:17,920
Scott: Least with the poison gas you would do the same amount of murdering but you wouldn't burn down the whole block.

394
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:28,896
Rym: Basically what it came down to is this was the most over-handed Inept police respect, you know people talk about like Waco and what was good what was bad and you know the catastrophe there or a Ruby Ridge.

395
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,247
Rym: This one takes the keg.

396
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:41,791
Rym: This is just police and civil servants Dealing with the situation in perhaps the worst Possible way and it ended up in just disaster.

397
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:44,984
Scott: and it I mean they could have like thrown like if they just wanted to set It on fire.

398
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:47,019
Scott: They could have just thrown like one molotov over there.

399
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:49,848
Rym: They could have just waited.

400
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:51,794
Rym: They didn't have that much food in there.

401
00:24:51,814 --> 00:24:53,860
Scott: I thought you said that they stocked up.

402
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,808
Rym: Yeah, but not enough they could have.

403
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:56,190
Rym: they could have.

404
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,279
Rym: it would have been cheaper to just surround the place.

405
00:24:58,641 --> 00:24:58,902
Scott: Keep it.

406
00:24:58,942 --> 00:25:01,416
Scott: Well, I assume they cut off the water and the electricity, right?

407
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:01,919
Rym: I don't know.

408
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:06,013
Scott: I mean you cut off the water and it's only a matter of time.

409
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:10,209
Rym: cut off water cut off electricity Tear gas constantly and terrible music.

410
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:13,160
Scott: Oh, and if they have a well though, you had to like poison it or something.

411
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:17,640
Rym: I'm sure they could have dealt with the well or special forces or something.

412
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,414
Rym: This is amazing and you should read the entire story of this.

413
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:23,317
Rym: and it gets worse.

414
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:32,054
Rym: the city Rebuilt the whole block for all the people who got kicked out With some of the most shoddily put together houses the world has ever seen to this day.

415
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:34,240
Rym: That neighborhood is a festering disaster.

416
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:37,059
Scott: We should go to that neighborhood just to be lol.

417
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:47,456
Rym: The story that the multi decade-long story of this debacle is an amazing thing to read about Mmm, so that is my thing of the day.

418
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:54,825
Rym: So the meta moment.

419
00:25:55,025 --> 00:26:00,600
Rym: next Thursday's show which is two Thursdays from now, we will be doing the GeekNights book club cosmos.

420
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,620
Scott: Oh shit, Carl Sagan's cosmo had a lot of time to read this people a lot of time.

421
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:14,860
Scott: If you care at all about science about humanity about astronomy If you're a human being and you're listening to this show and you didn't read the book you suck.

422
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:17,156
Rym: It's one of the more important books ever.

423
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:17,478
Rym: read it.

424
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:19,466
Scott: I wouldn't say that.

425
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:25,606
Rym: I would say that because it got an entire generation of American scientists a world Scientists into science.

426
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:28,655
Rym: it spawned a generation that I don't think we have an equivalent.

427
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:35,891
Scott: No, it's no Shakespeare It's no Out there in importance, I mean, you know, it's.

428
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:38,037
Scott: it's not any more important than earlier.

429
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:40,445
Rym: best-selling book Well, but best selling.

430
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,188
Rym: in what regard?

00:26:41,248 --> 00:26:42,613
Rym: I mean New York Times bestseller.

432
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,657
Scott: I don't know.

00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:44,460
Scott: It's a best seller.

00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:45,789
Scott: Who knows what that here's?

Scott: a lot of books are best-selling.

436
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:52,893

Scott: what would make you go to the website every day and So tell me and or at least not once in a while, of course along those lines We're not.

446
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:39,338
Rym: I mean, do you want to talk about the wave you gonna wait?

447
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,112
Rym: hmm, if you got basically if anyone out there wants to Collaboratively help us make show notes and things just you know, we're gonna.

448
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:48,300
Scott: I'm gonna start doing all that kind of stuff.

449
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:51,331
Scott: Yeah, the site is gonna have a lot more stuff.

450
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:53,720
Scott: I got some ideas, but I need other ideas.

451
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:00,187
Rym: We got a pipe and a hopper and the hoppers is coming along more than you'd expect except Rym's hopper Which he just shit talks.

452
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:03,000
Rym: My hopper is basically completely clogged until Connecticut happens.

453
00:28:03,322 --> 00:28:05,818
Rym: Yeah, you're just at least until the schedule goes to print.

454
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:10,996
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so so bread bread.

455
00:28:11,016 --> 00:28:13,405
Rym: Oh, man You guys definitely people.

456
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:17,436
Scott: there's the two things people ask for right our food shows and zombie shows.

457
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,880
Scott: and the zombie shows are never gonna happen.

458
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,342
Scott: It's never.

459
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:21,291
Scott: but you know food shows.

460
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:27,818
Scott: we thought the food shows are played out But you know what we'll give you is by the last food show ever at least for a while.

461
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:30,164
Scott: Yep But anyway, we'll talk about bread.

462
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:36,703
Rym: Bread is in fact a staple food prepared by cooking a dough of flour and water and possibly more Ingredients.

463
00:28:36,723 --> 00:28:39,358
Scott: Rym said that he was gonna read Wikipedia whenever he had nothing to say.

464
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:41,197
Scott: So now here he goes.

465
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:44,246
Rym: It is amazing.

466
00:28:44,627 --> 00:28:53,831
Rym: what if you ever get really bored find a Wikipedia article on something just so basic like bread or walking.

467
00:28:53,851 --> 00:29:04,593
Rym: and It is interesting to read a very deep discussion of something so simple and kind of the weird Associated facts and just sentences you would never expect to see in the rest of your life.

468
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:06,502
Scott: I Don't know.

469
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,240
Scott: The thing is let's talk about some breads, right?

470
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,825
Scott: It's a bread your favorite bread Scott.

471
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:15,359
Rym: if you had to pick right now one bread with you had to pick one bread right now.

472
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:16,804
Rym: Oh, I don't know.

473
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,069
Scott: I can't pick one bread.

474
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,992
Scott: That's impossible.

475
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,180
Rym: I think I would just have to go with some sort of like peasant bread.

476
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,748
Scott: It depends on what you need right like.

477
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:43,510
Scott: if I need a sandwich right like a big long sandwich I got to get that de Bellas bread, but if I need like, you know Sandwich right then I got to get my home pride, but if I need to Get some pastrami you need some Jewish right?

478
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:43,811
Scott: I need like.

479
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:44,754
Scott: yeah, I need like a ride.

480
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:45,738
Rym: Maybe a marble rye.

481
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:46,400
Scott: I don't know.

482
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,837
Scott: It's a different bread for a different time, you know.

483
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:52,769
Scott: and to stain You know, maybe I need a garlic bread.

484
00:29:53,352 --> 00:30:00,639
Scott: Maybe I need You know a bread, you know, if I'm having a burger I need like a bun with all sorts of sesame seeds all over it.

485
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:03,960
Scott: But if I get in a bagel, I might need everything bagel.

486
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,771
Scott: I need all kinds, you know And it's each variety of bagel a different bread.

487
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:08,795
Scott: or is bagel a bread?

488
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,540
Scott: bagel is a bread But everything bagel is not a different bread.

489
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,894
Rym: Bagel, you know, I think the toppings of a bread are independent of the bread itself.

490
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:19,619
Scott: So two different rise, right?

491
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:22,509
Scott: So it's not two different kinds of bread.

492
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:24,395
Rym: I think a rye is rye.

493
00:30:24,415 --> 00:30:25,719
Rym: now there's different grades of rye.

494
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,629
Rym: I mean at the top is like but I mean you got.

495
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:28,855
Scott: you got rye with seeds.

496
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:29,900
Scott: you got rye without seeds.

497
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,352
Scott: You got rye with like that.

498
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,320
Scott: They had a rye at the store.

499
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:40,919
Scott: They like a euro rye rye, which wasn't real pumpernickel and then they had real pumpernickel rye and then marble rye.

500
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,751
Scott: You know, I mean those different bread.

501
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:47,387
Rym: Yeah, cuz they all have different constituent elements But they're all under the subset of rye.

502
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:48,491
Scott: but but everything.

503
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:50,660
Scott: bagel and garlic and garlic bagel and onion.

504
00:30:51,082 --> 00:31:00,818
Rym: Well when you when you make a seeded rye you put the seeds in as an intrinsic part of making the bread When you make everything bagel, you kind of add them to the already effectively bagel bagel.

505
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:02,178
Rym: What if you got?

506
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,565
Scott: Raisin bagel that are actually is.

507
00:31:04,585 --> 00:31:08,460
Scott: there's something in the bread now that's different cuz it's mixed in our whole grain bagel.

508
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:10,371
Rym: I don't know about whole grain bagels.

509
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:11,337
Rym: That's some bullshit right there.

510
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:13,806
Scott: You know, you got it in free.

511
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:14,528
Rym: go to subway.

512
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:15,793
Scott: They give you like five choices.

513
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,478
Rym: There's no breaded subway.

514
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:18,285
Rym: Yeah, there is Bread.

515
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,059
Rym: That is a bread like substance.

516
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:22,986
Scott: No, see, I mean Taco Bell.

517
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:28,705
Scott: you could say that that is a Mexican food was the last time you ate at a subway Quite recently.

518
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:32,340
Rym: when cuz I ate at a subway a couple days ago cuz I was desperate and I was in a hurry.

519
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,450
Scott: I was in Brooklyn a couple months ago.

520
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,620
Scott: I had a subway that bread just and actually know it.

521
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,168
Scott: I'm feeling like going to subway right now after the show.

522
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:39,670
Scott: Really?

523
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,533
Scott: I don't know.

524
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:41,295
Scott: I just feel like it.

525
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,303
Scott: Ah What do you mean?

526
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:43,966
Rym: Uh, it's just.

527
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:47,000
Rym: it's so I'd all Wonder bread is below subway bread.

528
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,260
Scott: Okay, that's true.

529
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:54,280
Rym: I think what's ruined me is I have a very skewed perspective on bread now.

530
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,414
Rym: But right by the way is probably the most important food to be like.

531
00:31:57,454 --> 00:31:58,700
Rym: I eat more bread than anything.

532
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:02,908
Scott: Yeah, I know right and the thing is like I eat more bread than anything But it's also even in the city.

533
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:03,913
Scott: It's like hard to get.

534
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,240
Scott: you got to go like the place.

535
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,925
Rym: What are you got?

536
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:09,206
Rym: Well, maybe just cuz I work across from Grand Central I go to the hot and crusty.

537
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,700
Rym: the hot and crusty is great or I go to the Grand Central Market.

538
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,906
Rym: There's even more bread in there.

539
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:14,373
Scott: Yeah, but there's also sorrows.

540
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:24,612
Scott: if you really want some shitty bread Overpriced shitty bread, but I mean, you know, it's hard, you know, there's places that have breads But it's hard to find the exact breads that I want at.

541
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:26,020
Rym: you know, like what bread do you want?

542
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,885
Scott: Like I can't find a good rye bread that's fresh near me, you know hot and crusty has it Yeah, but nowhere near me.

Rym: There's got to be a Jewish bakery around.

547
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,734
Scott: Trying to find what I'm going to all these different places.

Scott: So you're at one place.

569
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:29,017

00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:07,819
Rym: So I'll basically cut like a couple of pieces of fancy like nice bread and I'll cut up some cheese Get some olives some nuts for that and eat all that together.

603
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:11,797
Rym: So I'll eat like three or four slices of bread every day.

604
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:17,256
Scott: when there's bread I'll eat like, you know that and it's not just hanging out of my mouth in the morning.

605
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:21,016
Rym: if there's bread I'm gonna make that like garlic bread or something with dinner.

606
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,864
Rym: That's just obvious I don't know.

607
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:27,240
Scott: I'll eat like, you know, the the Sutton coming out of my you know, a piece of toast.

608
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:37,479
Rym: Actually what I'll do a lot too is the toppings on the bread I'll take like one of those peasant style, you know Like the big round white like kind of doughy open bread like you had an Italian restaurant.

609
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:42,495
Rym: I'll do the the olive garden or the macaroni grill thing or I guess the Italian thing.

610
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:46,411
Rym: you put the olive oil and the pepper And the vinegar on a little plate.

611
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:48,381
Scott: I Don't know.

612
00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:58,420
Scott: I'll have the piece of toast hanging out of my mouth in the morning and then you know on the way home You know when I get home, maybe I'll eat something a little bit more bread and then I have a sandwich for lunch at work.

613
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:01,971
Scott: You know, it comes on some breads, but that's pretty much it.

614
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:09,927
Scott: I don't you know, I don't eat, you know vast quantities I eat, you know the correct amount Quality fairly vast quantities of bread.

615
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,959
Scott: then compared to you you do I think you need vast quantities of bread compared to most people.

616
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:16,129
Rym: People showed him you supposed to see what.

617
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:17,940
Rym: like 11 servings of grains per day.

618
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:24,168
Scott: Yeah, but I mean I eat lots of grains that are not bread like what like a melba toast That's a bread or a corn chip.

619
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:25,433
Rym: Do crackers count.

620
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:32,376
Scott: Yeah, of course, you know He's a bowl of cereal, you know, all these things are grains but are not.

621
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:33,640
Scott: you know bread straight up.

622
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,037
Rym: So I actually don't eat many of those things except crackers.

623
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:39,091
Scott: Oh, see I eat lots of things that are grains but are not.

624
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:40,758
Rym: I don't eat cereal because I can't stay.

625
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:41,260
Scott: no bread.

626
00:36:41,462 --> 00:36:44,902
Rym: I just can't drink milk Like cheese.

627
00:36:45,143 --> 00:36:48,151
Rym: you're supposed I like milk in things like god.

628
00:36:48,452 --> 00:36:51,160
Rym: well coffee effectively, but I don't like just milk.

629
00:36:51,702 --> 00:36:53,490
Scott: You got a dry cereal.

630
00:36:53,531 --> 00:36:54,133
Scott: It's just like bar.

631
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:54,435
Rym: Actually.

632
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:55,460
Rym: I usually eat cereal dry.

633
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,445
Rym: I'll get like granola or something.

634
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,630
Rym: Just put it in a cup and just drink it.

635
00:36:57,831 --> 00:37:03,239
Rym: Yeah, you drink you just drink Into my mouth, I mean why dirty a spoon?

636
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:05,796
Scott: Well, I mean you could just get a granola bar.

637
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:08,673
Scott: in that case Why no granola bars are so fucking dry.

638
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:14,260
Rym: every granola bar I find is either moist and juicy in that fake way that I can't deal with anymore.

639
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:16,648
Rym: It's the same moistness that you get in like a Twinkie.

640
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,460
Scott: No, the moistness of a Twinkie is different from like the kudos bar.

641
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:23,829
Rym: Yeah, the kudos bar still feels like weird to me.

642
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:24,210
Rym: I don't know.

643
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:30,005
Scott: I like the kudos bar because I like chocolate or or the the The what's the name?

644
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:33,038
Scott: the captain the the oatmeal guy the chewy bars.

645
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:35,084
Rym: Those are good Yeah, but they still.

646
00:37:35,124 --> 00:37:42,130
Rym: they feel weird to me compared to fresh granola, which is not dry ass But it's not wet either just kind of in between.

647
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:46,691
Rym: I can't stand those dry bars Like the nature's harvest whatever.

648
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:47,998
Scott: Oh God there that stuff.

649
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:48,360
Scott: I can't eat.

650
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,560
Rym: They basically just cut my throat all the way down.

651
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,546
Scott: Yeah, too scratchy.

652
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:53,660
Scott: and you know, I gotta have the chew with this chewy ones.

653
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:59,100
Scott: But I could see I do know the fake chewy like the cupcake with the white swirl on top, right?

654
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,562
Scott: Yeah, that's that fake, you know, okay, that's that preservative mushiness That's just discussed.

655
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:04,203
Scott: when I was a kid.

656
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:10,694
Rym: My favorite thing in the world was the orange version of that Cuz there's the chocolate one that all of normal kids ate.

657
00:38:10,714 --> 00:38:11,599
Rym: then I had the orange one.

658
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:14,516
Rym: This day I could not tell you what that flavor was.

659
00:38:14,536 --> 00:38:15,300
Scott: I don't know.

660
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,305
Rym: It was not orange nor was it vanilla at RIT.

661
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:23,104
Scott: I ate like the you know, fake preservative donuts and Cupcakes a couple times.

662
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:27,320
Scott: I never had a vending machine when I was desperate for like something that actually had weight to it.

663
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,103
Rym: So I never ate those.

664
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:31,154
Rym: but what I would eat is Krispy Kremes in explicable.

665
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:32,679
Scott: I ate all those a whole bunch too.

666
00:38:35,642 --> 00:38:36,204
Scott: Is there any?

667
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:38,856
Scott: there's got to be one in the city somewhere right I did.

668
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:39,820
Rym: Krispy Kreme is shit.

669
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:42,709
Rym: No, it's only good at RIT cuz we were poor.

670
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,514
Rym: There's a lot of calories in those things.

671
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:45,979
Rym: Those are some shit-ass.

672
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,103
Scott: no No, they're awesome.

673
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:48,006
Scott: They're terrible.

674
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:49,009
Scott: No, they're amazing.

675
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,073
Rym: They're terrible donuts.

676
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:52,180
Rym: Why do you think the company is doing terribly?

677
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,619
Scott: Because they've screwed up business-wise not because there was anything wrong with the product.

678
00:38:57,122 --> 00:38:58,286
Rym: Those are not donuts.

679
00:38:58,688 --> 00:39:00,576
Scott: They're just you and your donut, whatever.

680
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:01,620
Scott: Nobody agrees with you.

681
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:05,520
Rym: What do you think a real donut is fried dough from a baker?

682
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,182
Scott: Yeah, okay.

683
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:10,380
Scott: Listen, most people they like the kind of donuts that you don't like.

684
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:18,800
Rym: Yeah, I know but that day if you if you want to eat some weird at like, you know The things Dunkin Donuts makes you're fine too, but that's that's some bad stuff.

685
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:20,303
Scott: It's awesome.

686
00:39:20,906 --> 00:39:22,813
Rym: I don't know how you can eat that stone and Dunkin Donuts.

687
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:25,586
Scott: bagel hover on the other hand is the worst bagel in The entire universe.

688
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:27,922
Scott: I don't know anyone eats that bagel Like.

689
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:29,067
Scott: I'll eat those like I've.

690
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:29,328
Scott: you know.

691
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,220
Scott: bagel from the grocery store is it can actually be pretty damn good.

692
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:36,585
Rym: Bagel from Dunkin Donuts is like oh god I mean to me like a real donut.

693
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:37,628
Rym: like take a cider donut.

694
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,935
Rym: that is a form of a real donut.

695
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:40,918
Scott: cider donuts.

696
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:47,610
Rym: a donut It is but it's a special kind of what is a normal donut You know makes it good donuts a glazed donut from Krispy Kreme.

697
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,340
Rym: You know what top-hot donuts are real fucking donuts.

698
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,151
Scott: You know Krispy Kreme also a donut.

699
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:53,419
Rym: Nah, it's not a donut.

700
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:55,290
Scott: Krispy Kreme is a donut.

701
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,920
Scott: You're making like a No True Scotsman argument.

702
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,411
Scott: You're just done.

703
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:57,780
Scott: That's it.

704
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,280
Rym: Go look at the definition of a donut and how to make one and look at how Krispy Kreme makes a donut.

705
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,843
Scott: You're done.

706
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:03,874
Rym: Krispy Kreme is a donut in the same way.

707
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:11,279
Rym: No True Scotsman game over Scott, Krispy Kreme is a donut in the same way that Taco Bell is a taco, but it's not.

708
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,085
Rym: well How not?

709
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:19,115
Scott: no true Scotsman no true taco Because the Taco Bell does not actually contain what is required by the definition of taco.

710
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,740
Rym: What is the definition of a taco?

711
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:25,220
Rym: What is not in a Taco Bell taco, it's fun to say there's no meat in but you know what there's meat?

712
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:25,963
Scott: No, it's not.

713
00:40:26,043 --> 00:40:26,465
Scott: That's me.

714
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:27,007
Scott: It's not.

715
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:29,377
Rym: it's better meat in there than there isn't a Burger King.

716
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:30,863
Scott: It's soy It's it's not.

717
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:31,886
Scott: there's no actual meats.

718
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:34,112
Scott: The percentage of meat is not high enough.

719
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:34,875
Scott: You can measure.

720
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:36,480
Scott: you can measure with a ruler.

721
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:41,091
Rym: Wait, you just went from no meat to small amount of meat.

722
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:41,632
Rym: You're slipping.

723
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:47,600
Rym: Well, I mean there might be Yours clearly committing the no true taco fallacy.

724
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:50,331
Scott: Well, I mean how much grain does it I mean?

725
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,520
Scott: is a bread still a bread if it has like corn syrup in it?

726
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:55,160
Rym: Well, I guess we have to go by the definition of bread.

727
00:40:55,561 --> 00:41:00,739
Rym: So to go back to Wikipedia bread is a staple food prepared by cooking a dough.

728
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:03,959
Scott: Nothing's bread because there are definitely no staples in the bread that I eat.

729
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:09,560
Scott: I don't know if you got some swing line in your bread by cooking a dough of flour and water.

730
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:10,383
Scott: So what if?

731
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:12,412
Scott: so if you make it with corn chip is not bread.

732
00:41:12,473 --> 00:41:14,140
Scott: No, so what if I make corn bread?

733
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,396
Rym: No, no corn flour corn bread is not flour.

734
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:16,820
Rym: You're fine.

735
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:19,460
Scott: So it has to be flour of some grain.

736
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:26,262
Rym: So yes, but if I flour flour is a powder made of cereal grains other seeds or so What roots?

737
00:41:26,844 --> 00:41:27,868
Scott: or seeds or roots?

738
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:29,233
Scott: so it has to be milled?

739
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:31,160
Scott: Yes, you actually have to mill the grain.

740
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:38,991
Rym: So if you whole grain bread is not bread because there's no flour, you know, cuz they know the whole not Scott they're not just using the whole grains.

741
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:40,858
Rym: if they were doing that it wouldn't be bread.

742
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:46,240
Rym: It's mostly milled grains and they leave some of them unmilled which is fine in all these definitions.

743
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:49,880
Scott: So the breads that say 100% whole grain are false advertising.

744
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:55,280
Rym: Well, the whole grain also matters whether or not they leave like the husk on whether or not they leave the germ in there.

745
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,184
Rym: There's all sorts of stuff.

746
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:59,480
Scott: I don't know enough about grains really except they taste good.

747
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:00,219
Rym: I mean great.

748
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:10,120
Rym: We do not know if it was beer or bread that came first But beer or bread according to a lot of people is the absolute origin of human society and settlement.

749
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:13,132
Rym: Yeah, pretty much we couldn't have that until we invented one of the two.

750
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:17,190
Rym: beer probably came first At least from the things I've read but those could be biased.

751
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:17,572
Rym: I don't know.

752
00:42:18,899 --> 00:42:22,834
Rym: Oh Apparently bread should be stored in a container such as a bread box.

753
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:23,296
Scott: Oh shit.

754
00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:24,400
Scott: I don't store my bread in a container.

755
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,000
Scott: I just sort of leave it in the plastic bag and make sure it's tied up.

756
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:30,353
Rym: Uh, I actually put it in the bag, but then I put it in a small cabinet.

757
00:42:30,393 --> 00:42:31,818
Rym: that functions much like a bread box.

758
00:42:32,723 --> 00:42:33,267
Scott: Mmm, why?

759
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:35,159
Scott: why do you need to store your bread in a bread box?

760
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,440
Rym: Less chance of contamination by what other bread mold?

761
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:43,433
Scott: You know bread just gets moldy no matter what I do with that.

762
00:42:43,453 --> 00:42:52,340
Scott: my bread doesn't you know, it takes You know, the thing is it but by the time it gets moldy, you know If it gets moldy, it's been there for a long time and it's usually because I want to.

763
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:53,865
Rym: I will differentiate.

764
00:42:53,886 --> 00:42:55,552
Rym: there are two completely different kinds of bread thing.

765
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:57,760
Scott: Is that looking at you're like, oh my bread doesn't get moldy.

766
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,763
Scott: Yeah, well you eat the bread.

767
00:42:58,823 --> 00:42:59,887
Scott: You need a half a loaf.

768
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:01,532
Rym: That's what I'm saying to bread.

769
00:43:01,553 --> 00:43:03,780
Rym: I don't buy pre sliced bread.

770
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,558
Rym: Uh-huh ever I buy loaves of bread and I use that ugly knife to cut slices every time I want them.

771
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:19,571
Scott: See I We got to talk about the knife in a second But I like to buy a pre sliced bread depending on the kind of bread You know like the only see.

772
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:21,000
Rym: even I learned at the Zaya.

773
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,660
Rym: They don't make that many of them but that fancy the bread I get the sugar bread the white bread.

774
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:29,180
Rym: You can get that on slice and on sliced bread like like a rye bread.

775
00:43:33,092 --> 00:43:34,841
Scott: I try to slice the rye bread with a knife.

776
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:36,289
Scott: that slices come out too thick.

777
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,840
Rym: Get a bread mitre a mitre.

778
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,224
Scott: Yeah, what the hell is that?

779
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:43,030
Rym: You've obviously never done woodworking.

780
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:43,874
Scott: I don't think you have.

781
00:43:44,718 --> 00:43:46,950
Rym: I don't have one because I can cut fucking straight.

782
00:43:47,452 --> 00:43:49,920
Scott: But if you can't cut all the slices it perfectly.

783
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,532
Scott: every slice of rye bread when you go through that machine is like exactly like One centimeter.

784
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:59,190
Rym: So if you really can't do that and you want to have the perfect bread just get a bread mitre.

785
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:04,970
Scott: The other thing is that when I cut the bread right with a knife you make a mad crumbs fucking everywhere.

786
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:09,670
Scott: All right, and if I let them pre slice the bread crummage not an issue.

787
00:44:10,372 --> 00:44:17,866
Scott: So I like to keep the crummage to a minimum and get the pre slice bread depending on the kind of bread You know I realize people might be thinking I'm talking about the hats.

788
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:24,534
Rym: a Mitre is basically a box and use a special saw in it that has slots to make sure you cut things in the exact right Positions.

789
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:26,790
Scott: see I can cut the you know straight up and down.

790
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:29,421
Scott: The problem is cutting exactly one centimeters with.

791
00:44:29,702 --> 00:44:33,898
Scott: so that's why I guess I'm having the bread, you know Be it takes care of that situation.

792
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:34,640
Scott: Yeah.

793
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,343
Scott: All right.

794
00:44:35,564 --> 00:44:36,567
Scott: We got to talk about the knife.

795
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,330
Scott: So this is knife.

796
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,117
Scott: What's the find the exact name of the knife?

797
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:40,924
Rym: Oh, yeah, I'll look it up.

798
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:41,526
Rym: you talk about.

799
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:42,530
Scott: it's this yellow knife.

800
00:44:42,671 --> 00:44:43,093
Scott: It looks.

801
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:46,531
Scott: you look at this knife and it looks like the kind of thing that being grandma's kitchen Like.

802
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:49,590
Scott: it's all ugly and yellow and you're like what the fuck is that thing?

803
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,168
Rym: It's part of a whole set and all the other pieces in the set are really cool-looking.

804
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,438
Rym: The what the bread knife is just weird-looking.

805
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:57,466
Scott: Yeah, so it's like this yellow knife.

806
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,290
Scott: It's totally weird.

807
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:05,643
Scott: It is the best bread cutting knife in the universe in terms of like cutting a loaf The pure komachi bread knife by shouldn't.

808
00:45:05,924 --> 00:45:06,447
Scott: yeah, that's it.

809
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:12,350
Scott: so The thing is with this knife, it's serrated in such a way that you never had to sharpen it, right?

810
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,252
Scott: Well, it's serrated.

811
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:18,109
Scott: knives usually don't sharpen anyway, but it's serrated in both directions was sort of like these humps.

812
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:24,973
Scott: So when you push it forward it cuts and when you pull it backward it cuts but it cuts the same way whether you're going Backwards or forwards.

813
00:45:25,394 --> 00:45:30,710
Scott: so when you cut a bread with it you look at the bread and it's like this absolutely smooth cut.

814
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,183
Scott: It looks like you cut it with like the bread slicing machine.

815
00:45:33,223 --> 00:45:34,370
Scott: It's like so smooth.

816
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:40,667
Scott: It's straight down the middle and it makes minimal crummage compared to other knives Of course depending on the kind of.

817
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:47,281
Rym: well The reason for that primarily is that any time you've had trouble cutting bread with a bread knife It's not really a bread knife.

818
00:45:47,402 --> 00:45:47,764
Rym: Look at the.

819
00:45:47,805 --> 00:45:48,086
Rym: look at the.

820
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:48,670
Rym: we'll link to this.

821
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,193
Scott: We learned this.

822
00:45:49,234 --> 00:45:51,630
Scott: we went to the store right where I bought a bunch of knives.

823
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:52,890
Rym: I wasn't even there as you and Emily.

824
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:58,852
Scott: Yeah And this guy he's like we're looking for a bread knife and a whole bunch of them say bread and we're like which one should We get?

825
00:45:58,892 --> 00:45:59,555
Scott: that one looks weird.

826
00:45:59,576 --> 00:46:02,150
Scott: He's like no, that's a deli guy finally comes to help us.

827
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,195
Scott: He's like that's a deli knife.

828
00:46:03,517 --> 00:46:07,013
Scott: It just says bread on it so we can actually sell it, you know He's like here.

829
00:46:07,053 --> 00:46:07,856
Scott: you want this one.

830
00:46:08,418 --> 00:46:12,548
Scott: It's an ugly duckling, but it works and I'm like you sure he's like Oh, yeah.

831
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:19,776
Scott: So I trusted the big fat knife selling guy at the store and boy am I glad I trusted that guy Because he knews about knives.

832
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,282
Scott: He works in the knife store.

833
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:22,907
Rym: So well, how many knives did he have?

834
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:23,570
Scott: kitchen store?

835
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:24,585
Scott: Yeah, like a hundred knives.

836
00:46:25,412 --> 00:46:26,295
Scott: It's the kitchen store.

837
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:30,370
Scott: but as like this great knife section they actually have a knife club and I'm in the knife club there.

838
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:31,713
Scott: It's pretty awesome.

839
00:46:31,974 --> 00:46:33,800
Rym: Plus this bread knife 20 bucks.

840
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:37,784
Scott: Yeah 20 bucks for the only bread knife You'll ever need for the rest of your life.

841
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:38,250
Scott: Why not?

842
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,962
Rym: You might eventually bust it and have to get another one like 40 years.

843
00:46:41,022 --> 00:46:42,570
Rym: How could you possibly break it?

844
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,255
Rym: I don't know if you don't.

845
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:47,790
Scott: if you have a marble cutting board It's a good thing to get as a gift for people, you know.

846
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,568
Scott: Like if you don't have one cuz like here I bought you this bread knife.

847
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:51,132
Scott: It's.

848
00:46:51,212 --> 00:46:53,746
Scott: and then they use it and like holy shit, you know and you add it.

849
00:46:53,766 --> 00:47:01,278
Scott: see if they eat bread It's something they'll actually use a lot and will actually make a difference in their lives as opposed to if you get them Like I don't know an expensive appliance.

850
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:01,600
Scott: They never.

851
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,030
Scott: they use like once in a blue moon like a bread maker.

852
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:10,112
Scott: Yeah, it's a great the great knife the pure komachi Awesomeness.

853
00:47:10,354 --> 00:47:10,596
Rym: Yep.

854
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:12,087
Rym: Ah, you should get a bread.

855
00:47:12,107 --> 00:47:15,921
Rym: minor though Cuz remember if you don't slice your bread it lasts a lot longer.

856
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:18,870
Scott: Let me go on Amazon and search for bread miters.

857
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,150
Rym: I don't know if anyone makes bread miters specifically.

858
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,855
Rym: I mean it develops.

859
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:23,910
Rym: we had one we made ourselves that we use forever.

860
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,210
Scott: You know what?

861
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,258
Scott: They have those those bread like shoots.

862
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:32,884
Scott: you like send the bread down the chute and there's a chainsaw in there Basically or spinning and it goes near and slices it perfectly in half.

863
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:34,370
Scott: I like that action.

864
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,850
Rym: You just get a whole bread cutting machine this element like creating barrel.

865
00:47:36,991 --> 00:47:40,230
Scott: Yeah, but that's not something you have for a house with what an apartment would be awesome.

866
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,696
Rym: No, you know you have your loaf of bread.

867
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:42,238
Rym: people come over.

868
00:47:42,258 --> 00:47:43,725
Rym: You're like, all right guys want some sandwiches.

869
00:47:43,865 --> 00:47:47,018
Scott: Oh I see how the bread miter works.

870
00:47:47,058 --> 00:47:48,885
Scott: Yeah, that's not really gonna work.

871
00:47:48,905 --> 00:47:52,203
Rym: for the rye bread though You'd have to get one that was the right size and shape.

872
00:47:52,223 --> 00:47:53,350
Scott: Yeah, I don't think they have one day.

873
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:54,890
Scott: Oh, there's only three on Amazon.

874
00:47:55,191 --> 00:47:55,714
Rym: You can make one.

875
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:56,236
Rym: when I was making.

876
00:47:56,257 --> 00:48:00,098
Scott: there is this one that was good for cutting bagels exactly in half Wouldn't bagel miter.

877
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:01,710
Rym: I actually get a bagel miter.

878
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:06,127
Scott: They also have baguette miter and a French minor, but they don't have a rye miter.

879
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:07,396
Rym: I'm surprised.

880
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,710
Rym: didn't you ever take like a shop class?

881
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,330
Rym: Miters sawing is like one of the first things you learn with that flat backed weird back.

882
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,935
Scott: Yeah, now I know what a miter is.

883
00:48:13,955 --> 00:48:15,399
Rym: It's also a funny hat.

884
00:48:16,362 --> 00:48:17,003
Scott: It is indeed.

885
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,290
Scott: Okay, so this I can't find a rye miter.

886
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:26,446
Rym: Uh, there's got to be some like Jewish deli site that has like the miter the perfect miter.

887
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:29,393
Scott: I can't find one anyway Do we?

888
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:31,124
Scott: how much longer do we have to talk about bread?

889
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:32,150
Rym: I think we can cut it off.

890
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,856
Rym: We I really fucking like bread.

891
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:41,190
Rym: I think my let's just go down, you know favorite breads like overall man I like so many bread cuz I really like like peasant bread like the white.

892
00:48:41,391 --> 00:48:46,209
Rym: I like like they're really crusty on the outside like spirally rolls with poppy seed on the inside.

893
00:48:46,711 --> 00:48:50,730
Rym: It's like really airy and loose, you know, basically I don't like any bread.

894
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:51,192
Scott: That's like.

895
00:48:51,272 --> 00:48:55,998
Scott: I like breads that have a lot of substance, but I don't like them to be like heavy in the stomach You know, it's like.

896
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,130
Rym: well, it depends.

897
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:58,816
Rym: I mean, I like a good pumpernickel.

898
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:02,949
Rym: if the mood is right pumpernickel is not heavy in the stomach of real pumpernickel is.

899
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:05,239
Scott: no It's not I'm talking about like these breads.

900
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,528
Rym: We didn't even tell you know, what pumpernickel bubble.

901
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:09,030
Rym: save that We don't tell the list.

902
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:14,939
Scott: I'm talking like you go to the grocery store and there's a bread and it says like 12 grain and you bite into it like One bite and you're full cuz.

903
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:16,389
Rym: well that is a separate issue.

904
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,050
Rym: I found that seems weird lately and a lot of foodies are talking about this more and more.

905
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:28,170
Rym: There seems to be this war on white bread because you know Most people think white bread think Wonder Bread or you know slice bread in a bag from the grocery store.

906
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:33,838
Scott: The thing is the problem with those breads is white bread, you know Wonder Bread I think to white bread in general I don't like.

907
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:39,590
Scott: but like I get like, you know home fried wheat bread Which you know, I mean it still has corn syrup in it.

913
00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:56,650
Scott: man They need to open up a pond cotillion in Queens.

914
00:49:56,951 --> 00:50:02,510
Scott: Instead of going to Subway after the show I could go there and get the baguette sandwich another poor place to work.

915

Rym: Yeah, actually I wouldn't get a sandwich though.

933
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:45,839
Scott: Yeah, it's all about the high quality crust But the thing is the crust has to have like a flavor.

00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:56,290
Scott: no the crust like brings all these great flavors, and then the inside has to be nice and squishy But it also has to have you know a flavor.

937
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,058
Scott: But hey, you know the thing is I don't like it.
