1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,970
Rym: Hey, it's Monday January 25th.

2
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:12,673
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:14,599
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:18,239
Rym: tonight We talk a little bit about tablets ahead of the Apple tablet.

5
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:32,320
Rym: Well, I actually bought my new computer.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:40,260
Rym: It's sitting completely built and really unnecessary new computing completely built and working and prosthetic long sitting next to me right now.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:50,056
Rym: But I'm still doing GeekNights on the old computer because the whole point of this was that I can set everything up on the new Without interrupting GeekNights any further than we've already interrupted it for the past.

9
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:53,829
Scott: all the holidays and moving You're always like the slowest to set up computers.

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,793
Scott: if I get a new computer.

11
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:57,342
Scott: It's working like the next day 100%.

12
00:00:57,342 --> 00:01:09,280
Rym: Well, no problem I didn't get all the parts until you know not that long ago and the day the video card came yesterday or earlier The day the video card came it was booted and then I went out of town for the whole weekend.

13
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,167
Rym: So I just got back.

14
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:13,798
Scott: I don't go out of town when computers are coming in the man.

15
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:14,841
Rym: Yeah I was.

16
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:22,442
Rym: I was debating skipping my out-of-town obligation, but I'm glad I didn't because it was actually really fun and relatively productive Mm-hmm.

17
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:28,521
Rym: All right, but I don't really want to talk about that what I was doing cuz that's like anime stuff that Monday people don't Care about.

18
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:32,895
Scott: I said there's not a topic of conversation for this moment in time.

19
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,600
Scott: No, it is for a later time.

20
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,752
Rym: But the computer, you know a couple of notes.

21
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:44,200
Rym: for a hundred and fifty bucks I got a 32 gigabyte solid-state drive and I installed windows on that.

22
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:48,960
Rym: This wouldn't have worked if I'd gotten the bigger windows with that stupid XP compatibility mode.

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,700
Rym: But the only thing I needed that XP compatibility mode for was cool edit and I decided I'm not gonna bother with cool edit anymore.

24
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,084
Scott: Oh, that's why okay.

25
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:57,205
Scott: Yeah.

26
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:58,389
Scott: Yeah the windows.

27
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:01,860
Scott: I don't understand why anyone would buy the professional version.

28
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,410
Rym: It's really there's one reason to.

29
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,980
Rym: if you're a company you need it to do all the domain stuff.

30
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:13,221
Rym: What do you need it to do if you want to like connect to the domains in certain ways like you really need that version There's.

31
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:14,828
Scott: I'm trying to find the stupid chart.

32
00:02:14,888 --> 00:02:15,511
Scott: Oh, here's the chart.

33
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:15,852
Scott: Okay.

34
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:16,454
Scott: Yeah.

35
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:17,720
Scott: Yeah the domain joining.

36
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:19,379
Scott: You need to do that.

37
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,505
Scott: But the thing is right.

38
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:25,046
Scott: if you are a company and you're buying like that Then you're.

39
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:26,391
Scott: you have like a site license.

40
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:27,154
Scott: so that shit don't.

41
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:35,860
Scott: it doesn't matter nearly as much Yeah as if you're buying an individual copy, which is why you know, it's like I think they could actually help themselves out a lot.

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,390
Scott: It's like okay for home people.

43
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:41,240
Scott: They should only have Home premium and that's it, right?

44
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:50,492
Scott: Because if the home premium were sort of halfway between the price of the home basic and the home premium I take issue with them even calling it home premium because there's no non premium version.

45
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,599
Scott: Well, no this home basic there is.

46
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,907
Scott: yes It's basically useless Wow.

47
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:56,509
Scott: It's big.

48
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:57,532
Scott: It does nothing that you need.

49
00:02:57,693 --> 00:02:59,458
Scott: I didn't even it doesn't have Windows Media Center.

50
00:02:59,538 --> 00:02:59,819
Scott: It doesn't.

51
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:03,112
Rym: Right media center is not that on useful.

52
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,900
Scott: Okay, so here I got the chart, right?

53
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:07,440
Scott: So yeah, you want you don't want home basic.

54
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:10,291
Scott: I know is it called?

55
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:11,696
Scott: it's called starter edition.

56
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:12,479
Scott: Wow, right.

57
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:20,539
Rym: What I don't get is the home like the ultimate version doesn't offer anything to make it worth the money at all All right.

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,800
Scott: So yeah.

59
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,420
Scott: So the professional one gives you XP mode which is pointless because why do you need XP mode?

60
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,905
Scott: I can just get virtual box for free again.

61
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:35,322
Rym: corporations need it because it is better than It is.

62
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,979
Scott: virtual is all it is is like Microsoft Virtual PC.

63
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,727
Rym: No, I mean the reason.

64
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:43,020
Rym: as far as I can tell it makes the Windows install much bigger.

65
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:51,120
Rym: That's the main reason I didn't get it because if I got the XP compatibility mode Windows would not have fit on the 32 gigabyte solid-state drive.

66
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:56,360
Rym: I would have had to buy the 64 gigabyte solid-state drive which would have made my computer stupidly more expensive.

67
00:03:57,382 --> 00:04:03,455
Rym: That is pretty much the reason I did not get any version But home basic because I didn't want to get a bigger solid-state drive for the OS.

68
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:05,443
Scott: Mm-hmm No, but I mean like.

69
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:08,753
Scott: they sell home premium professional and ultimate right?

70
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:10,720
Scott: These are the three versions they sell, you know.

71
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,820
Scott: Why do they even sell the professional and the ultimate like individually?

72
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,839
Scott: You know who you know, I mean in stores, you know.

73
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,004
Scott: I mean I could understand that they should have them in like a secret place on the website for the few people that actually need That yeah,

74
00:04:24,024 --> 00:04:28,465
Rym: and then like a link like I'm a business person who needs one more license Like you click here and they've got that

75
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:36,040
Scott: right there aren't that there are very very small number of actual people who need Professional and ultimate on an individual, you know retail

76
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:38,510
Rym: I would argue Microsoft is very smart with the ultimate.

77
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,916
Rym: ultimate doesn't offer any tangible benefit Really?

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:50,302
Rym: Well by selling it in the store if you have home basic premium and ultimate with the black People that don't know better will say yeah, I want the biggest one I want it.

79
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:53,360
Scott: I want the one that goes to like sell a few copies of the biggest one.

80
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,320
Scott: But I think that they would do a lot better by you know, reducing consumer.

81
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,043
Scott: Remember that guy.

82
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:07,354
Scott: he talked about how when people are given a whole bunch of choices on their 401k of what to pick A lot of them just end up not picking because the choice is too difficult with Windows.

83
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,460
Rym: That's not an option for most people.

84
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:10,358
Rym: They're not gonna use Linux.

85
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:21,540
Scott: No but I'm saying is that a lot of people might choose Mac instead whereas they should just say go to the store and it's just Windows 7 and there's only one of them and it's all premium and it's you know.

86
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,920
Rym: I point out the vast majority of people will never buy a Windows operating system.

87
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,178
Rym: They will buy a computer that just has a Windows on it and they don't know or care about that.

88
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:35,172
Scott: beyond the point Might sell more retail II and make more money.

89
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:36,758
Scott: if they did what I said, I think they would.

90
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:37,420
Rym: I don't think they will.

91
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:38,840
Rym: I think those people just buy a new computer.

92
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:50,017
Scott: Yeah I think that is a problem is that there are a whole lot of people out there like there can basically break their computer and a software way and they get rid of the hardware and We need to do something about.

93
00:05:50,037 --> 00:06:00,807
Rym: of course We have the opposite problem of Scott and I had acquired enough hardware to build like four or five working computers But it was so much of a pain in the ass to get all that old Athlon All working with itself.

94
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:03,780
Scott: the problem is that we were trying to dispose of it responsibly.

95
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,252
Scott: We could have just thrown it in the trash.

96
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:05,817
Scott: like 90% of people.

97
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Rym: There's a lot of people like we could have taken all that and made a whole bunch of working computers.

98
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:14,233
Rym: But we have more computers than we need working already

99
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:23,351
Scott: and there's plenty of places you always see on the news Like we take old computer parts and make working computers and then we give them to poor people and I'm like, dude I'll totally bring my computer parts to one of those places.

100
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:27,414
Scott: They're so hard to do those places Like there weren't any nearby.

101
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:28,380
Scott: I searched on Google.

102
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,540
Scott: It's like all those like only maybe two of those and they're in California or something.

103
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:31,882
Scott: It's.

104
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,759
Scott: there was no one in the area who would take our stuff.

105
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,035
Rym: there was one in like the Bronx that we had to go to during the day between like 8 a.m.

106
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:39,296
Rym: And 5 p.m.

107
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,170
Rym: and Physically give the stuff to them and pay them for the privilege.

108
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,280
Scott: Yeah, it's like no, that's just not gonna happen.

109
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,156
Rym: And sadly you wonder why you find so many, you know dangerous toxic computer components.

110
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:52,160
Rym: just throw it out in the woods.

111
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:53,065
Rym: It's why?

112
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:58,899
Rym: it's because if you're a responsible person you'll do it But if you're if you don't care, it's a lot cheaper to just chuck it.

113
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:01,009
Rym: Yeah, and there's no way to catch these people.

114
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,953
Scott: No, there's no way to.

115
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:07,473
Scott: and the thing is even though there are Responsible ways to get rid of things there aren't.

116
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:09,760
Scott: they're not everywhere and they're not all convenient.

117
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:13,019
Scott: If you're not convenient and you're not everywhere you might as well not exist.

118
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:18,680
Scott: It's like ego because the amount of coverage you're getting is basically not enough to make a difference.

119
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:29,779
Scott: You need to you know if you want to Be a computer recycling place You need to accept things From anywhere and you need to not charge people money to take their stuff and you need to be open at all hours.

120
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,772
Scott: people need To be able to walk up at like, you know 9 p.m.

121
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:34,479
Scott: After work and drop off their shit.

122
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:36,960
Rym: But uh, you know other interesting notes.

123
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:52,700
Rym: I got that and tech 900 that everyone's getting because it's pretty much the best non crazy expensive PC like mid-tower ATX case there is except it's kind of ugly but It's super ugly but functionality wise it is pretty much great.

124
00:07:52,921 --> 00:08:01,190
Rym: In fact, the inside of it is a lot better than the much more expensive much more quote unquote Nicely designed case that I had for my old computer.

125
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,053
Scott: That looks a lot better.

126
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:03,660
Rym: Yeah, the old computer looks a lot better.

127
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,288
Scott: That's the intake p180, right?

128
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:07,740
Rym: Yeah, it's got that nice door on the front.

129
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,480
Rym: It's got like the really cool cable chain.

130
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,580
Scott: I have the intake solo, which is just perfectly fine and normal except that the front door is kind of blue.

131
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:19,693
Rym: Oh this front door people were like the front door is gonna break off immediately.

132
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:21,860
Rym: and I broke the front door off immediately.

133
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:23,550
Scott: Yeah, they're really bad with doors.

134
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:24,798
Rym: thing is the door.

135
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:27,459
Rym: I don't know I never opened it anymore because I don't need my DVD drive.

136
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:36,318
Rym: Yeah But I realized more and more that all the cut all the things that the more expensive cases have to offer are things that I Don't need anymore.

137
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:44,087
Rym: I mean I used to need like the ability to pull out my hard drive cage because I'd like swap out hard drives install new Hard drives, I never opened this p180.

138
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,272
Rym: I built it.

139
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:46,857
Scott: She's got an acrylic cowboy.

140
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,987
Rym: I Like the acrylic cowboy.

141
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:50,859
Rym: There's a lot of cool cases like that.

142
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,341
Rym: now There's all.

143
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:54,592
Rym: there's a whole bunch of competition in the like acrylic cowboy market.

144
00:08:54,652 --> 00:09:01,959
Rym: in the exposed motherboard case I guess strata Mmm, some of them look pretty cool, but I worry about dust.

145
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,911
Scott: Well, it's not supposed to be something that you use.

146
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:07,200
Rym: some of these are definitely use all the time cases.

147
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,949
Rym: I question the logic there.

148
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:11,100
Scott: the acrylic cowboy is not a use all the time case.

149
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:16,520
Rym: All right, but I did go with the GTX 260 as opposed to the 250 for the Nvidia card.

150
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,440
Scott: Oh, you didn't listen to those ATI fanboys.

151
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,187
Rym: Alright kids and I will say this.

152
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:22,809
Rym: Yes.

153
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:27,944
Rym: The ATI cards are more powerful per dollar at the price point I was looking at.

154
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,959
Rym: however, I need it to work in Linux.

155
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:32,724
Rym: That's it.

156
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:35,240
Rym: And I do not trust ATI for shit in Linux.

157
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,507
Rym: I've had too many bad experiences and no one.

158
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:43,299
Rym: there is no evidence that the ATI drivers are as good as the Nvidia drivers in Linux or at all.

159
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:44,703
Rym: I'm not gonna.

160
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:50,838
Rym: I will not speak on that part because I don't know enough about it and I'm not going to fall on my old man prejudices.

161
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,420
Scott: Old man, I mean, it's just like, you know, and people talk about these things.

162
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,300
Scott: They just you know, all they look at is like these benchmarks and the prices and they'll for example, right?

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,072
Scott: We had to do is something that I know 100% sure, right?

164
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:06,060
Scott: We were talking in the forum also about monitors, right?

165
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:09,696
Scott: And of course people didn't know what the hell they were talking about except for me because I know what

166
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:22,015
Rym: I think is when I was researching monitors way back I agonized over the decision and I looked at like the specs of the ultra sharp versus the non ultra sharp versus like some other non Dell and I was like, ah, and finally I was like, you know what?

167
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:23,160
Rym: I'm just gonna do what Scott did.

168
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,225
Rym: I'm just gonna buy the ultra sharp.

169
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:26,575
Rym: I'll just buy the nice one because everyone says it's better.

170
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:26,996
Rym: You know what?

171
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:27,820
Rym: It's perfect.

172
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:30,960
Scott: Yeah, the thing is people like Scott Johnson, right?

173
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:38,757
Scott: It was a big new egg sale during like Black Friday, whatever He bought like two big ol LCDs that were wicked cheap like a hundred something bucks.

174
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:40,082
Scott: And he was like, oh, yeah I'm so awesome.

175
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:44,200
Scott: I got these giant cheapo LCDs and I'm like these LCDs are not so great.

176
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,660
Scott: First of all, they have a glossy screen which gets lots of glare in the Sun, but that's just a personal preference.

177
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:55,405
Scott: You know, maybe you don't have any Sun and then it looks kind of nice, you know, I mean I mean is I'm 50/50 on glossy But I don't like the glossy at all.

178
00:10:55,565 --> 00:11:00,160
Rym: It depends like some laptops get away with it, but that's that's a preference, right?

179
00:11:00,602 --> 00:11:02,609
Scott: The point is that people look at all these stats.

180
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,874
Scott: They look at maximum resolution.

181
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:05,320
Scott: They look at refresh rate.

182
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:08,773
Scott: They look at contrast ratio, which is usually completely false.

183
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,115
Scott: You know what?

184
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,480
Scott: It's like thread count, right?

185
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,979
Scott: You can't look at contrast ratio.

186
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:19,060
Rym: The most important things kids that everyone forgets to look at is one how well does it swivel and tilt?

187
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,271
Rym: Yes, that is more important than half the other stuff on it.

188
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:24,380
Rym: Yeah, two it's better.

189
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:26,688
Rym: It better have at least one if not two DV eyes.

190
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:27,712
Rym: Otherwise, what's the point?

191
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:28,936
Scott: Yeah, what inputs does it have?

192
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:29,900
Rym: and three?

193
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:35,917
Rym: Check out the horizontal and the vertical viewing angle because those cheap LCDs usually have a shit.

194
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:38,168
Scott: vertical viewing angle That's true team.

195
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:40,220
Rym: They can't swivel that well, so you're fucked.

196
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:45,020
Scott: But the most important thing to look at is just simply what kind of screen is it, right?

197
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,980
Scott: I mean the thing is these days they pretty much people know, you know, at least tech people know.

198
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,414
Scott: They know LCD and they know plasma right?

199
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:53,400
Scott: They know the difference.

200
00:11:53,661 --> 00:12:02,100
Scott: They might even know the difference between like an LCD that uses cathode Lighting for its backlights and an LCD that uses LEDs for the backlight.

201
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:14,386
Scott: yeah, they might even know the difference when the LEDs that are backlighting it are just on the edge of the monitor or when They're directly behind the screen which is even better because then you get a nice even lighting and you don't have sort of this Messed up kind of contrast.

202
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:18,920
Rym: go even the old LCDs remember they even have one passive matrix versus active matrix.

203
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:28,340
Scott: Yep They even have ones Nowadays where the LEDs are sort of in an array behind the screen and if one area of the screen is dark It'll turn the LEDs off to get a better contrast ratio.

204
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:47,300
Scott: The only problem with that is on the edges of like, you know sharp things you might have sort of, you know artifacting going on, but anyway, what people don't look at is the most important thing is that most TFTs, which is an LCD screen these days that you buy in a computer monitor or even a television are twisted pneumatic, right?

205
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,708
Scott: That's how they work.

206
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:55,100
Scott: and a twisted pneumatic TFT is only capable of displaying six bits per color.

207
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,307
Scott: That is six twelve eighteen bit color.

208
00:12:57,628 --> 00:12:58,612
Scott: two to the 18th.

209
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:06,839
Scott: power is like two hundred something thousand so the monitor is only capable of displaying physically two hundred thousand something colors.

210
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:17,814
Scott: an IPS screen is the only LCD monitor that is capable of actually displaying 16.7 million colors, which is what your computer is rendering.

211
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:27,625
Rym: That's why you bought that expensive ATI video card that renders 32-bit color except I will point out back in the days of CRT's where you didn't have to worry About that CRT.

212
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:29,941
Scott: I mean, yeah CRT could always display 16.

213
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,426
Rym: There was that long period.

214
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:36,984
Rym: but when LCDs just could I remember you bought one of the first LCDs with a low enough refresh rate To actually work for gaming.

215
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,450
Scott: Yeah, the 12 millisecond.

216
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:38,771
Scott: Yes.

217
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,614
Scott: Yes Samsung's.

218
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:41,460
Scott: Yeah, of course now my tea like one of them's right over there.

219
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:41,782
Scott: I see it.

220
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:44,698
Rym: I think mine has a six millisecond my TV claims to have.

221
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:52,320
Scott: I think a IPS monitors do have you know lower refresh rates than a twisted pneumatic, but they still get 60 Hertz, which is enough.

222
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:53,988
Scott: That's perfectly fine.

223
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:56,299
Scott: That was more than they way used to be a long time ago.

224
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:59,340
Rym: Yeah, I'm happy to get 60 FPS in every game.

225
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,770
Scott: I felt like you guys have these.

226
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:25,717
Scott: like you'll see a guy you'll have like You know three video cards lined up rendering these beautiful 32-bit color scenes and he'll only be seeing 200,000 you know Like a mere fraction of the color of the different colors, you know They'll be like like a leaf and leaf love like a thousand different greens and he's only seeing like three different greens Because he's monitor his poop and he doesn't even realize it because people can't actually tell what their eyeballs think

227
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:25,898
Rym: about.

228
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,465
Rym: like I was trying To buy a TV, right?

229
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:40,834
Rym: I end up getting that one a pretty nice Samsung but the what I noticed was that there were like four different price classes in the 52 inch range and If you didn't know what all these specs mean there's like you.

230
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:41,416
Rym: look at them all like.

231
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:51,100
Rym: these TVs are all identical Except that one of them cost three thousand dollars more than the other one Mm-hmm, and it had to do with like what kind of backlight what kind of refresh rate and all that stuff?

232
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,740
Rym: Well, I don't want to say all that stuff because half of the matters and half of its bullshit.

233
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,452
Scott: Yeah, like even some of it does matter like contrast ratio does matter.

234
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:00,940
Scott: The thing is the number they tell you is wrong.

235
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:06,940
Scott: Yep, it's like if you go to the store to buy some like I was just saying You know the thread counts on sheets.

236
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:07,964
Scott: They don't.

237
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:09,510
Scott: most of those are lying to you.

238
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,634
Scott: Like you see go to the store.

239
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:11,477
Scott: It'll say like 1000 thread count.

240
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:13,906
Scott: It might be like 500.

241
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:20,336
Rym: they could just lie on that shit or they they use some other Definition that doesn't quite jive with what's really there.

242
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:34,864
Scott: on average It's actually if you go on the internet you can go and it'll tell you which brands of different bedsheets and it'll say Reported thread count actual thread count and some of the brands have you know slight differences like, you know reported 500 actual 475.

243
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:44,478
Scott: Some are like reported a thousand actual 100. so You can usually tell though by the price of the sheets and also by opening up and feeling that

244
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:52,432
Rym: yeah Well think about it you get what you pay for and while it's easy to overpay for something that doesn't live up or doesn't do What it says it does a

245
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:53,060
Scott: monster came.

246
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:53,542
Scott: It's

247
00:15:53,884 --> 00:16:06,660
Rym: equally easy to buy something that is cheaper and not Understand why it's cheaper and the fact that the more expensive one is actually superior And a lot of times the more expensive option is a better value per dollar

248
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:07,743
Scott: Mm-hmm, which

249
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:13,980
Rym: honestly it sucks if you don't have enough money to buy the best value per dollar part like processors, right?

250
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,785
Rym: I got the core i7 920.

251
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:19,723
Rym: Okay, it's it was like $288.

252
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:20,025
Rym: Okay.

253
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:29,080
Rym: Now if you look at the curve It's the best dollar per performance in the Intel core i7 because the next one up is like $480.

254
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:36,290
Rym: Oh, yeah, and the next one after that is like seven and they're only marginally faster and the next one under it They're basically the same thing only crook slightly.

255
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:39,281
Rym: So but the next one under it is like $250.

256
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:43,514
Rym: So there's obviously like the price per dollar gets to this maximum value point.

257
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:49,880
Rym: if you buy something more than that You're basically saying I'm willing to spend a ton of money for like a 1% performance increase.

258
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:56,179
Rym: But if you buy below that you're basically saying I didn't have enough money to buy the maximum value and it totally sucks for me.

259
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:58,533
Scott: Yep That's just said.

260
00:16:58,777 --> 00:16:59,559
Rym: yeah Of course.

261
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:10,075
Rym: Really if you're gonna buy under the maximum prep like the optimal price point on the highest end Intel like the i7 You should go buy a dual core instead because you'll probably be better to do.

262
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:11,460
Scott: I was still holy shit awesome.

263
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:12,523
Scott: I mean I have one.

264
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:16,420
Scott: it's already wicked old, but it's still one of the fastest and best chips out there.

265
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,490
Rym: Yeah, I mean the core tube solo back in the door.

266
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,738
Rym: the core solo was pretty good.

267
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:22,339
Scott: It's okay.

268
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,640
Scott: I mean, I have one of my laptop and it's a little a for its time.

269
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:27,740
Scott: Yeah, it has a little trouble with high def YouTube.

270
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:33,426
Rym: I want to point out for anyone who doesn't realize when I bought the new but that's also partially because it has the Integrated Intel graphics.

271
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:38,366
Rym: I ended up having to buy six gigabytes of RAM and I didn't want six I only wanted four.

272
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:39,010
Rym: I wanted exactly.

273
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,357
Scott: there's no reason to have six.

274
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:43,840
Rym: However Triple channel I needed three dims.

275
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,900
Rym: So basically my choices were three gigs of RAM not enough obviously or six gigs of RAM too much.

276
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,719
Rym: So I had to buy the stupid six gigs.

277
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:56,260
Scott: Luckily, I would have done the same thing if I had also the triple channel.

278
00:17:57,464 --> 00:17:59,611
Rym: They have this pack of three two gigabyte dims.

279
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:02,080
Rym: that is cheaper than a lot of four gigabyte.

280
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:05,560
Scott: If only you could have gotten three one and a half gigabyte dim.

281
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:12,500
Rym: I know I considered getting six one gigabyte dims just to fully load out all my dim slots, but now that's stupid.

282
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,960
Scott: Yeah, because in the future you might buy be able to get like three, you know, maybe something crazy will happen.

283
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,240
Scott: There'll be some crazy app that just uses shit ton of RAM.

284
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:23,477
Scott: You'll be able to buy like three four gigabit days ago.

285
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:23,939
Rym: tick tick tick.

286
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:30,507
Rym: My philosophy was right with RAM is that that's one of the biggest things you can revitalize a computer with when the RAM it uses Is dirt cheap.

287
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:31,620
Scott: Oh you want to hear funny story?

288
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,218
Scott: So my aunt right she had a computer and the computer was really slow.

289
00:18:36,258 --> 00:18:40,598
Scott: and Blair Right and it was obviously because she filled it with full of crap with some e-machine, right?

290
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,688
Scott: It was like the company that made.

291
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,979
Scott: it was a machine, but it was just a PC.

292
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:45,951
Scott: So I check it out and I'm like, alright.

293
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,520
Scott: Alright, there's nothing really wrong with it.

294
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,292
Scott: It's just full of Blair and she really didn't have anything on it.

295
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:51,960
Scott: All she did was like go to Facebook and stuff.

296
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,157
Scott: So I'm like, oh, I'll just wipe it.

297
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:54,785
Scott: So it had a Vista disk.

298
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:55,266
Scott: it came with.

299
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,260
Scott: so I reinstalled the Vista and it worked and it was significantly better.

300
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,398
Scott: But it was still slow and I realized it basically only had 512 megs of RAM yet.

301
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:03,880
Scott: It shipped with.

302
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:07,000
Rym: My video card has more than that.

303
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,574
Scott: So 512 megs of RAM is not enough to run the Vista that this thing came with.

304
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:15,642
Scott: so obviously it was one of those You know bargain-basement piece of craps Monitors.

305
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:17,132
Scott: so, you know, I she gave.

306
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:18,220
Scott: I was at her house.

307
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:23,460
Scott: So we took her credit card who went to Newegg and I ordered the maximum two gigs of RAM for that computer.

308
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,192
Rym: It's probably dirt cheap by that point.

309
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:26,199
Scott: It was like 40 bucks.

310
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:29,619
Scott: I was like this as soon as you put this in the computer, it's gonna be amazing, right?

311
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,180
Scott: So they ordered it and it showed up and I explained to my cousin like how to install it.

312
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,252
Scott: I'm like, you know, well you put it in these slots here, right?

313
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:42,439
Scott: I Hear I heard the other day for my parents that they tried to put it in while the computer was on and they fried it.

314
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:45,232
Scott: Turn it off.

315
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,020
Rym: It's like I thought you were going to say and the computer was a thousand times faster.

316
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:53,737
Scott: It would have been if they would have turned the computer off before putting it in there.

317
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:54,845
Rym: man You know, what's really?

318
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:56,259
Scott: I told them but they didn't listen.

319
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:57,445
Scott: It's like I did.

320
00:19:57,505 --> 00:20:02,547
Scott: turn the computer off unplug it put the things in the servers I work with we can.

321
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:10,214
Scott: hot-swap RAM CPU motherboards Yeah, so I'm just like so maybe they didn't throw it out.

322
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,800
Scott: Maybe there's a chance actually get this.

323
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,398
Scott: There's a slight chance that it works and if I go there I can check it out and see what the situation.

324
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,650
Rym: one thing I Didn't do cuz I'm gonna buy a NAS instead.

325
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:23,646
Rym: I just have one physical hard drive I bought like the best value like cheapest 650 gigabyte hard drive there was.

326
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:32,636
Rym: that was fast just to put like all my games and stuff on and all my like working files With a HCI which now is supported well and fully in both Linux and Windows 7.

327
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:34,864
Rym: Mm-hmm I tried it.

328
00:20:35,225 --> 00:20:41,399
Rym: I can mount and dismount and connect and disconnect Sata drives without powering off the computer.

329
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:47,637
Rym: Mm-hmm, so I could have used one of those back planes and had a raid 5 in the computer.

330
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:49,284
Rym: That's hot-swappable Right.

331
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:52,020
Rym: I didn't because I'm gonna make an I'm gonna get a NAS or something.

332
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,960
Rym: But it's really cool that that is kind of come to fruition to where I can do that with just commodity hardware.

333
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:57,663
Scott: Yeah, why not?

334
00:20:58,005 --> 00:20:58,146
Rym: Yeah.

335
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,733
Scott: All right, you want to see some news?

336
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:03,331
Rym: Yeah, we should get away from my computer But my computer is a tiny god.

337
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:04,999
Rym: I'm very very happy with it.

338
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:10,100
Scott: so You know when you're backing stuff up right, you know.

339
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:17,100
Scott: And you need to back it up permanent Like most people nowadays are using something like Amazon s3 to back up on the Internet's because you need the remote backup.

340
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:22,740
Scott: Or maybe they're backing up onto actual hard drives because a one terabyte hard drive is fucking cheap as all hell, right?

341
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,492
Scott: You just be like BAM hundred bucks back up a whole terabyte of stuff.

342
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:27,622
Rym: Maybe you have some regulatory Requirement.

343
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:30,915
Rym: it has to back things up onto an immutable media like some sort of optical things.

344
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:32,260
Rym: So you can't change it later.

345
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:39,404
Scott: Well, yes says many people do have these government requirements or perhaps, you know physical requirements You know the.

346
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:54,499
Scott: for their own security desires They want something to be on a physical thing that they own not on anyone else's computer not on some hard drive that might crash but on a tape or a disk that is permanent that they can then copy and ship one to one place and keep one in another place perfectly safe.

347
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,169
Scott: and they own it and it's in a safe and no one can get to it.

348
00:21:57,189 --> 00:21:59,598
Scott: and Mostly companies need to do this.

349
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,104
Scott: not normal people but companies.

350
00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:05,188
Scott: and the thing is many companies do this You know with maybe a blu-ray or something, right?

351
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,076
Scott: But how much does a blu-ray hold like?

352
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,610
Scott: I don't know not that much really like 30 gigs something like that, right?

353
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,570
Rym: It's amazing how fast a physical media like that becomes obsolete in the modern day.

354
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,730
Rym: That's why I don't care about blu-ray because it's gonna be completely supplanted by digital.

355
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:26,282
Scott: Yeah, blu-ray blue blu-ray can have 50 gigs for a dual layer disk.

356
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:29,774
Scott: Oh 200 gig 200 gig disks are available Right.

357
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:31,368
Rym: All right, that's that's that's.

358
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:34,177
Scott: It's like I'd rather buy the one terabyte hard drive.

359
00:22:34,217 --> 00:22:36,985
Scott: Yeah for like said problem is they're not immutable.

360
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:41,800
Scott: But anyway, so You know many places though are very old.

361
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,409
Scott: They still use magnetic tape.

362
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,985
Rym: I'll just note at least that magnetic tape has a lot of advantages.

363
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:53,840
Rym: depending on what you're trying to do Magnetic tapes can hold a fucking shit ton of data.

364
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,988
Scott: So, um, you know a while ago, right?

365
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:12,095
Scott: There were they released eight terabyte magnetic tapes, but IBM and Fujifilm They just invented a new magnetic tape that they advertised in a in an awesome old-school Advertisement, right?

366
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:15,365
Scott: That's all like, you know UNIVAC magnetic tape.

367
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:16,107
Scott: It's black and white.

368
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,170
Scott: It's pretty good, right?

369
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:18,775
Scott: Guess how much this met.

370
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:19,739
Scott: run real of this.

371
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:27,610
Rym: new magnetic tape can hold you wouldn't to quote Futurama You wouldn't ask unless it was either a really really big number or a really really small.

372
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:32,976
Scott: So they now they just invented and are selling 35 terabyte magnetic tapes.

373
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:34,881
Rym: now think about that.

374
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:38,570
Scott: It is rare that there that's 35 hard drives, right?

375
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,584
Scott: So think 35 hard drives, you know, you know what a hard drive looks like.

376
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:42,146
Scott: just imagine 35 of them.

377
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:46,602
Scott: Now one roll of tape it can hold all that.

378
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:48,669
Scott: that is how good this magnetic tape is.

379
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:50,690
Rym: order of magnitude.

380
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:58,812
Rym: It is very rare that things jump by an order of magnitude from one from one technological step from 8 to 35.

381
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:04,987
Scott: So 8 16 so more than five more than four times as much per tape as before.

382
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,614
Rym: One thing I love in general There's you could

383
00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:16,740
Scott: back up like even if you have a shit ton of data like, you know A place like where Rym works might have you could get a few days on one Or maybe even a few weeks on one of those tapes.

384
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:18,730
Scott: It might be worth getting the system that uses them.

385
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:28,129
Rym: It's just frightening and amazing and awe-inspiring that just in the last five years or so The technology related to computers has been increasing at it.

386
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:40,708
Rym: Like there are discoveries on this magnitude on a fairly regular basis right now And I think computing as we know it within 10 years is going to be almost Unintelligible and indistinguishable from what we have now.

387
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:48,630
Rym: Like if you think computers from 10 years ago look crappy We're gonna get to the point to where a computer that's six months old looks like cuneiform on a clay tablet.

388
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:52,145
Scott: Oh, they actually they put them in uh in cartridges nowadays.

389
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:55,980
Scott: You don't actually need the roll of tape They just have a tape thing and you slide it in and you're all done.

390
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:58,250
Rym: Uh, it's been that way for a long time.

391
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:01,802
Rym: No, in fact at ibm, we had these gigantic awesome robots.

392
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:02,344
Scott: I'm watching.

393
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:09,870
Scott: i'm watching videos of uh, You know tape reel cartridges at ibm right now you should find videos of like our ibm archive robots in the warehouses.

394
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:13,909
Rym: They they basically the warehouses move the tapes around on their own, right?

395
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,089
Rym: Yep We also have new physical things around.

396
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:22,468
Rym: They're cute because they'll if I get in their way when they're like puttering around with something They'll be like, please get out of my way.

397
00:25:23,032 --> 00:25:24,237
Rym: Please get out of my way.

398
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,483
Rym: I need help.

399
00:25:25,644 --> 00:25:26,729
Rym: Please get out of my way.

400
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:29,197
Scott: Will they really say I need help?

401
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:31,550
Scott: I need help and you'll have to pick one up and shove it to get it in.

402
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:32,902
Rym: No, these things were bigger than me.

403
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:33,589
Rym: they would kill a man.

404
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:34,936
Rym: Oh, they there were.

405
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:36,524
Scott: why are they saying please get out of my way.

406
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:42,497
Rym: They should be like get out the way Get the fuck out the way Some of the warehouse.

407
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:52,049
Rym: So, you know speaking of advancement like that this article is just crap.

408
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:53,897
Rym: but The article raises a point.

409
00:25:53,957 --> 00:25:57,050
Rym: i'm coughing out here because we're you know, we've already talked a lot about my computer.

410
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,690
Rym: So i'd feel guilty bringing up the news.

411
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,465
Rym: But the fart conversation is kind of interesting.

412
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:03,455
Rym: remember that woman Amy who was.

413
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:03,796
Rym: he did.

414
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:11,445
Rym: she did a ted talk about prosthetics because she's missing two of her legs And she has prosthetic legs that are better than real legs for running.

415
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:22,667
Rym: Yep, and more there are more and more articles like this kind of pop sci or commentary or op-ed articles talking about the fact that You know What are we going to do when people get to the point of?

416
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,250
Rym: Like electing to have surgery to have a prosthetic that's better than their real body.

417
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,906
Rym: I mean are people going to start our pictures going to cut off their arms get a prosthetic.

418
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:31,830
Rym: Is that legal?

419
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,053
Rym: Is that like?

420
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:34,159
Rym: what's that going to do to sports?

421
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,265
Rym: What's that going to do to society?

422
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:35,989
Rym: Should we allow it?

423
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,050
Rym: And I just want to nip all this in the bud by saying yes is definitely going to happen.

424
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,156
Rym: There's nothing we can do about it.

425
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:44,850
Rym: And the future of our society is cybernetics and ghost in the shell.

426
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,197
Scott: yeah, I mean everyone's always.

427
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:54,702
Scott: you know, I took how many classes at rit that were all about like Technology and ethics and the scary cyborg future.

428
00:26:54,762 --> 00:26:56,770
Scott: and yeah, I took like 10 classes on that.

429
00:26:57,052 --> 00:26:59,510
Scott: It should have been like a you know, a special minor or something.

430
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,455
Scott: But were you in the same boat?

431
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,761
Rym: I was where every class.

432
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:05,159
Rym: the conclusion in the end was It's going to advance.

433
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,185
Rym: It's all going to happen.

434
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:06,950
Rym: It can't be stopped.

435
00:27:07,131 --> 00:27:10,682
Scott: Actually the conclusion of most of my classes was just like yeah.

436
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:13,410
Scott: Well, you know technology itself isn't evil.

437
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:14,094
Scott: You know, there's.

438
00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:16,370
Scott: you know, an atomic bomb just sitting there isn't bad.

439
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,570
Scott: Just people picking one up and dropping one on someone is bad.

440
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:25,907
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it's like, you know We should always try to invent new sciences that use it responsibly and not for evil.

441
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:30,113
Rym: and you know I think it's more than a lot of people They make.

442
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:33,785
Rym: they beg questions whenever these arguments come up, you know, someone will the question.

443
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:35,230
Rym: the articles always say things like.

444
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,806
Rym: But you know, it'll be a bad thing or they imply that it'll be bad that people augment themselves.

445
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:42,090
Rym: or are they even human?

446
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,949
Rym: That's the biggest question.

447
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:47,950
Rym: If someone starts modifying their body to that extent for no good reason are they even human anymore?

448
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:48,792
Scott: Well, if some?

449
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:52,150
Scott: well, that begs the question is the lady who just lost her two legs human?

450
00:27:52,190 --> 00:28:00,101
Scott: Yes So if I put on a super leg to be a kicker in the nfl or something Then I am also still human as human as that lady.

451
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:03,050
Rym: that is the uh ship of thesius conundrum.

452
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,744
Rym: You know if we have thesius's ship it was the ship that he went out.

453
00:28:07,964 --> 00:28:09,309
Scott: Oh your favorite ship of thesius.

454
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:11,863
Rym: I remember Yeah, he kicks everybody's asses with this ship.

455
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:18,870
Rym: so the people say all right We're gonna save this ship forever and they put it in a dry dock and they're like look that was thesius's motherfucking ship.

456
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:23,570
Rym: So, you know a hundred years go by and one of the planks of wood rots because it's an old ship.

457
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:26,010
Rym: So to repair it they replace that one plank of wood.

458
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:29,750
Rym: Is it still thesius's ship fast forward a thousand years?

459
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,862
Rym: They've replaced every single plank one by one over a thousand years.

460
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,630
Rym: Is it still thesius's ship?

461
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,202
Rym: Take the same concept and apply to your human brain.

462
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:40,760
Rym: if you replace one brain cell with a chip That does the same thing that brain cell did.

463
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:41,947
Rym: are they still human one?

464
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:46,743
Scott: It's 100 identical in every single way to that brain cell.

465
00:28:46,783 --> 00:28:49,090
Scott: In fact, no forget to forget doing a chip, right?

466
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:59,550
Scott: They make an absolutely 100 perfectly identical Brain cell in a thing and then they surgically replace the other one in the exact same position.

467
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:03,484
Scott: So not even a question about like electronics in here it's a brain cell.

468
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:05,250
Scott: it's just one they made outside.

469
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:07,040
Scott: It's exactly the same as the one that's inside.

470
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,568
Rym: still humanship of thesius all that.

471
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:13,830
Rym: so To get back to the big question the big question, you know people ask are they even human anymore?

472
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,042
Rym: The real question is does the word human even mean anything?

473
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:18,729
Rym: Yeah, it's not a matter of humor.

474
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,348
Rym: now We're all just consciousnesses that may or may not have free will.

475
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:25,215
Scott: yeah I mean, it's it's pretty much.

476
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:37,499
Scott: the problem is that people attach, you know, these semantic, you know words Uh to emotional ideas that really have no Real connection to the realities of our universe.

477
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:44,318
Scott: So when we learned any, you know, when the the we discover New disturbing, you know realities of our universe.

478
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:53,785
Scott: they disturb because they conflict with the existing realities Upon which you know all our current assumptions of language and everything else are based on.

479
00:29:54,086 --> 00:30:02,790
Scott: so when the foundation is shaken Everything else would be shaken on top which is you just have to sort of Shift over and get an earthquake proof building and then you'll be all right.

480
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:22,286
Rym: well which is interesting because I just picked up uh our scout backers neuropath and As far as I can tell the whole kind of thread of the book Is basically the idea that it takes a whole bunch of characters And confronts them with the reality that everything they do is a product of everything that came before them and cause and effect and that they probably don't have any free will.

481
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:24,234
Rym: and That's one thing.

482
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:27,908
Rym: I mean philosophers have debated that point for as long as there have been people.

483
00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:35,790
Rym: the point this book brings up is What if you have a world now where science has basically proven all of that to be true?

484
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,761
Rym: What if you prove that you don't have your own free will?

485
00:30:37,862 --> 00:30:44,450
Scott: well, it doesn't matter because things Things were going to turn out that way anyway, and things will turn out the way they were going to turn out.

486
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,356
Scott: So it doesn't change.

487
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:51,409
Scott: Yes knowing it doesn't change it But at the same time only knowing for sure that it's not there can change it.

488
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:56,970
Rym: Yep, but it raises an interesting question of how Does that does it affect a society?

489
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:08,890
Scott: It's like how inventing time travel can't change anything because if you do invent time travel you would have invented time travel And any time travel to the past that could have affected the past before you currently has already happened.

490
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:15,990
Rym: Well, unless unless you have time lords that stop you and there's some sort of intergalactic police But everything that they have done will have already happened.

491
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:24,990
Rym: Maybe or maybe time is non-linear and there's just this one long contiguous time frame That follows the protagonist's point of view and that's the only actual timeline.

492
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:27,944
Scott: But then that that one is completely not going to.

493
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:29,070
Scott: you're never going to you know.

494
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:32,206
Scott: If someone changes something in the past, you're not going to know it now.

495
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:32,769
Scott: You're not going to go.

496
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,124
Scott: Someone just changed the past.

497
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,413
Scott: fuckers It's you wouldn't?

498
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:37,175
Scott: you wouldn't even know.

499
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:40,970
Rym: you might if you're the protagonist and the entire frame of reference of the universe is around you.

500
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:49,198
Scott: If if you are the time traveler, then you would know that you change the time but your actual time personally Would just be what it is.

501
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:55,130
Rym: it would be like going on vacation to the past Unless it was bill and ted where you know, you say things like man.

502
00:31:55,733 --> 00:32:02,266
Rym: It was so great after we solved all this stuff where we went back and put the blah in the blah And then the blah and the blah is there as long as they remember to do it later.

503
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:05,164
Rym: Yeah Yep, god, I gotta watch that movie again.

504
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:09,020
Rym: That movie was fucking awesome but anyway, I just I I don't know.

505
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:22,989
Rym: I wanted to bring this up because it It's becoming more and more likely that in our lifetimes We're all going to have to confront the reality of the fact that we are likely going to take human consciousness Break it down and put it for real in a machine.

506
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:24,273
Rym: Yeah, like.

507
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:25,820
Rym: I have no doubt that in my lifetime.

508
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,553
Rym: We will see a ghost in the shell style person I stand.

509
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:30,300
Rym: I believe that a hundred percent.

510
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,389
Scott: Yeah, but I don't believe ray curves while he's a nut.

511
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:36,970
Rym: Actually, no, I I think that shiro has a better handle on what's actually going to happen.

512
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:48,969
Rym: Yeah, I mean well the thing shiro has the right balance of People are fucked up and will do weird stuff and have gigantic butts but at the same time the science will be there.

513
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:54,230
Scott: Mm-hmm Kurzweil thinks that like if he eats vitamins like a thousand vitamins a day is gonna live forever.

514
00:32:54,290 --> 00:33:00,997
Rym: So now the way to live to forever is to put your brain in a robot body and then eventually put your brain's brain In a cybernetic thing.

515
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:02,324
Scott: i'm going for a jamison body.

516
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:02,867
Scott: I know about you.

517
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:10,230
Rym: Oh, man I'm hoping at least if they get to jamison technology before I die Then I can go to jamison and hold out until I can be the major.

518
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:14,230
Rym: Yeah, I realized talking to emily, you know, we're watching ghost in the shell standalone complex again.

519
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,913
Rym: You know I'm watching that.

520
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:24,870
Rym: reading neuropath and reading this article all at the same time made me think about this a lot And emily said man I hope I live long enough to just be able to have the major's body.

521
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,608
Rym: And I realized that my only response to that is so do I?

522
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,178
Rym: Mostly because I also want the major's body.

523
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:34,330
Scott: Here's something I realized right just now two seconds ago.

524
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:38,329
Scott: It's kind of good that i'm practicing playing some street fighter because you know what?

525
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:42,950
Scott: In the See where you're going in the ghost in the shell world, right?

526
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:49,510
Scott: You know, no one can really have the major's body because it's so incredibly difficult to control that kind of body.

527
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:53,790
Scott: It's just really really fucking hard And that's why people have jamison bodies.

528
00:33:53,911 --> 00:34:00,413
Scott: Like if you put jamison's brain in the major's body He'd probably just stumble around like a doofus if he could even stand or walk The major.

529
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:01,459
Scott: is that fucking hard?

530
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,890
Rym: the major is only the way she is because she was kind of Fucked as a kid and put into these like she lived.

531
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:08,120
Scott: Yeah, she was in that body since she was like zero.

532
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:10,270
Scott: so she's an expert at controlling cyborg bodies.

533
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:14,628
Scott: She basically had played street fighter constantly because it's so complex.

534
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:20,989
Scott: just walk You know let alone do the thing She does like jump off a building or kick someone's ass and do martial arts.

535
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,770
Rym: She gets the point of playing street fighter on like 10 simultaneous games and kicking ass in all of them.

536
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:40,650
Scott: Yeah, so, you know by practicing street fighter and get keeping my brain able to do you know complex physical coordinated things like that I am increasing my abilities to perhaps control a more complicated and advanced cyborg body in the future.

537
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,257
Scott: So maybe I won't have to be in a jamison.

538
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,829
Scott: Maybe I could be more like, you know, you want to be in chun li?

539
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:46,389
Scott: No, not really.

540
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:49,664
Scott: But you know the thing is in all reality.

541
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:51,010
Scott: I would probably be more like togas.

542
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:55,409
Scott: I'd be like the guy who's just you know doing nothing and i'd be cool because I was the mostly human guy.

543
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:59,495
Scott: Nah, except you'll be old But togas is the best guy.

544
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,378
Rym: I don't know.

545
00:35:00,438 --> 00:35:01,301
Rym: I think it's weird.

546
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:10,930
Rym: I've realized that by and large it's girls Who like the major is their favorite character and by and large guys like togasa bato and aramaki equally.

547
00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:12,629
Scott: Uh, aramaki is totally awesome.

548
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,237
Scott: Togusa is the best dude.

549
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:18,887
Rym: I think togasa has the uh, awesome badass, but understated.

550
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:26,365
Rym: He's the hachiroku exactly, but bato has the Dude, I should just put my brain in hachiroku and aramaki is just astro boy.

551
00:35:26,386 --> 00:35:27,229
Rym: Yeah.

552
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:37,487
Rym: So Anyway things of the day.

553
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:41,319
Rym: as I go back to college humor because this is too cool to pass up you suck.

554
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,845
Rym: This too shall pass.

555
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:48,580
Rym: It's a marching band video that is totally awesome and not on a football field.

556
00:35:49,103 --> 00:36:07,740
Rym: I don't want to say anything else about it other than it is totally fucking awesome Especially when they use the camouflage and I like things that start really small especially musical acts Like you start with just freddie mercury singing and then one by one you keep adding backup dancers and backup singers Until there are 10 000 people on stage in a spectacle.

557
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:14,736
Rym: That's pretty much all I want out of life and this video does that to a small degree Except without freddie mercury because no one could ever get anywhere close to that.

558
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:18,876
Scott: All right So Rym likes to complain a lot about this thing.

559
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:22,790
Scott: that is true About the devorahi keyboard and how you know.

560
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:23,653
Scott: people don't realize.

561
00:36:23,753 --> 00:36:25,920
Scott: maybe some people don't realize this but there is a you know.

562
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,903
Scott: You look at your keyboard.

563
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:27,987
Scott: It's a qwerty keyboard.

564
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:28,248
Scott: Why?

565
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,195
Scott: because you look at the top left and it says q-w-e-r-t-y.

566
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:38,400
Scott: All right, the qwerty refers to the arrangement of the letters, you know, why aren't they in alphabetical order?

567
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,446
Scott: Why aren't they in some other order?

568
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:40,687
Scott: Right?

569
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:43,858
Scott: So devorak was this guy not john c devorak?

570
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:44,460
Scott: a different devor?

571
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,007
Rym: I believe you mean john devorak.org slash block.

572
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:51,780
Scott: No anyway, and he decided he came up with a different layout for the keyboard, right?

573
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,684
Scott: And what you know?

574
00:36:52,865 --> 00:36:56,863
Scott: his logic, you know, if you just think about it common sense wise Make sense.

575
00:36:56,943 --> 00:37:02,320
Scott: The devorak keyboard has the most frequently used letters near the index finger and on the home row.

576
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,853
Scott: So like the home row is like a o-u-r-s-t or something like that.

577
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:08,792
Scott: I forget exactly what it is But it's like a-o-u-r-s-t-l.

578
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:18,989
Scott: So like, you know, you're basically you have the least you theoretically you have the least finger movement while typing If you get used to that layout as opposed to the qwerty layout.

579
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:23,507
Scott: and there's all sorts of fud, you know out there Talking about how.

580
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:29,231
Scott: uh, you know, the devorak keyboard is better you can type faster and it's better ergonomically speaking and it's just better.

581
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:34,531
Scott: and people just don't use it because there's some sort of Evil monopoly something something we're not going to get into it.

582
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:37,383
Rym: Don't even it's wrong It's not better.

583
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:50,180
Rym: And in fact, it's worse for the single reason that even if it is marginally better from a efficiency standpoint The whole world uses qwerty and you're at a disadvantage if you're required to use this one special weird one to type, right?

584
00:37:50,260 --> 00:38:00,520
Scott: Well, it says here in this article at reason.com They typing errors the standard typewriter keyboard is exhibit a and the hottest new case against markets.

585
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:07,841
Scott: But the evidence has been cooked and basically what happens is in all kinds of economic debates people always talk about you know How.

586
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:16,268
Scott: oh, well, whoever's first to market or achieve mark or achieves market dominance early wins even if they're not superior Because you know that.

587
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,760
Scott: and then the qwerty is like the example of that, you know.

588
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:25,933
Scott: And sometimes they try to use like vhs is the example of that like oh beta max is better But vhs won because it was first or something like that conflated though.

589
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:28,222
Rym: I mean beta max was and basically Right.

590
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:52,889
Scott: So basically here's a gigantic article that talks about not only presenting all this evidence that no dvorak isn't actually better But b this whole market theory of first to market or first to market dominance is complete bullshit and better things do win quite often You know, I mean look the xbox 360 was first in this console generation And you know, it's beating the ps3 But the ps3 is still alive and the we is out selling them both.

591
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,540
Scott: So first to market didn't mean dick squat, right?

592
00:38:57,183 --> 00:39:04,580
Scott: so Check out this article and learn some stuff and do not use the dvorak keyboard and anyone who uses dvorak keyboard is not your friend.

593
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:14,348
Rym: So We got to talk about the stupid apple tablet because everyone else I want to talk about just about the apple tablet.

594
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:22,920
Rym: I want to talk about tablets in general because they're this weird Market space that's always been really niche and there's been booms and busts of tablets more than once.

595
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,580
Scott: Well, I think the problem with the tablet right is that the tablet was sort of an obvious idea.

596
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,400
Scott: It wasn't like some you know, it was one of those things like everyone was imagining it even before we could make it, you know.

597
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,226
Scott: So, you know, it was.

598
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:39,662
Scott: it was very quick for someone to make one as soon as they could because it was just so Obvious.

599
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:41,128
Scott: everyone was always thinking about it.

600
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:42,252
Scott: Oh, of course a computer.

601
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:45,012
Scott: That's just a screen that you hold like a book duh.

602
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:47,519
Scott: So, you know, they finally made some.

603
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:55,820
Scott: Well, actually they've made them for a very long time for as long as they'd have touch screens and they've had You know different varieties of resistive touch screens for quite a while.

604
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,909
Scott: They they were just sort of expensive and difficult to get you know, but they were around In like the 90s.

605
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:02,420
Scott: you can get a touchscreen they existed.

606
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:31,636
Scott: But it wasn't until like the early 2000s when microsoft actually came out with like microsoft windows tablet pc edition And like viewsonic and all these other companies they made tablet pcs that you know were just The screen and and with a stylus because it resistant resistive and they had a thing where they had an on-screen keyboard And you would you know, you could write actually handwriting and they had a pretty good handwriting recognition thing Sort of like the newton did you know, which is also sort of a tablet pc.

607
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:32,640
Scott: It was just smaller.

608
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:41,480
Scott: and the thing is these things kind of sucked because Well, you know the battery life was poop because you know laptops were also poop in those days.

609
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,111
Rym: The touch screens were nothing like modern touch screens.

610
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,160
Scott: No, they were terrible touch screens.

611
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,868
Rym: Handwriting recognition was not great.

612
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:51,499
Rym: Like it was good great relative, but it wasn't good.

613
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:56,912
Scott: and two Writing is a lot slower than typing And they didn't have any sort of custom user interface.

614
00:40:56,932 --> 00:41:00,189
Scott: like you had a palm pilot which had you know A little area you could draw on.

615
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:01,760
Scott: that was touch sensitive, right?

616
00:41:02,341 --> 00:41:07,100
Scott: And those are all right because the whole thing was made assuming that you were going to do that.

617
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:16,560
Scott: But a tablet pc was just a copy of windows your web browser that was on there Or you know was not designed to be used with you know, the tabletness.

618
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:28,740
Scott: So basically you would touch the location bar And then you would have to use the handwriting recognition to put in a url or the on-screen keyboard And then you get a web page and it's like you couldn't pinch and zoom in or scroll it easily.

619
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,240
Scott: You had to like use the stylus on the scroll bar to go up and down.

620
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,933
Scott: You couldn't just sort of scroll up and down with your fingers or whatever.

621
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:40,879
Scott: So they're pretty much Absolutely terrible and useless and they never sold and they couldn't even think.

622
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:44,894
Scott: you know They made these things and they said well, you know who the hell wants one.

623
00:41:44,935 --> 00:42:01,642
Scott: What force they tried to think like Oh, well You know doctors are going to want one because they stand up and use the computer like they are imagining like a doctor standing next to a patient's bed with this tablet pc instead of a you know, a clipboard full of stuff or like Maybe someone who's out in the field like a construction site will use it because they have you know Pretty much.

624
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:09,638
Scott: they imagined any job they could think of where they could imagine a person holding a clipboard And they thought that that was the person who needed the tablet pc.

625
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:23,939
Scott: now I will admit they're forgetting that all of those people on their clipboards had like these very custom and specialized forms that they were Filling out that they would need to write custom applications for to go on the tablet pc and those applications were never written.

626
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:34,220
Rym: Yep plus the fact that a lot of the data entry stuff in like hospitals or Construction sites or anything that they did have on their old like unique like terminals connecting to a mainframe.

627
00:42:34,961 --> 00:42:37,650
Rym: They weren't going to hire anyone to write any custom software.

628
00:42:38,051 --> 00:42:42,860
Scott: and also if you think about it right a doctor takes out a clipboard And he's got a lot of stuff to write on there.

629
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:49,681
Scott: Maybe it's going to take him a lot longer to write it with even if you're good handwriting nation in virtual keyboard versus, you know Dr.

630
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:51,968
Scott: Scrawl on the on the piece of paper, right?

631
00:42:52,048 --> 00:42:55,880
Scott: So the tablet pcs were just completely terrible for everyone.

632
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,505
Rym: Well, I think straight up.

633
00:42:57,565 --> 00:42:59,611
Rym: the way to analyze this is look at the modern market.

634
00:43:00,053 --> 00:43:02,400
Rym: There are two primary in my opinion.

635
00:43:02,521 --> 00:43:05,459
Rym: Well, I guess now there are three markets for a tablet pc.

636
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:13,619
Scott: I'm talking like a large tablet like and all of the people making them are completely ignoring these markets And they're going for markets that do not exist.

637
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:20,300
Rym: And the weird thing is these three markets are almost all completely mutually exclusive in terms of what the people want in their tablet.

638
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:25,380
Rym: Exactly market the first because they're the easiest ones the people who want something new and shiny.

639
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,212
Rym: They want a crazy apple tablet that looks all fancy.

640
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,920
Scott: They'll buy whatever you make so it doesn't matter.

641
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,729
Rym: Yep, make it really expensive and shiny.

642
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,517
Rym: It's just a gigantic iphone.

643
00:43:33,537 --> 00:43:34,000
Rym: They'll be happy.

644
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:35,568
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't matter what it is.

645
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:36,393
Scott: It could be poop on a stick.

646
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,700
Scott: They'll buy it now market.

647
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:45,500
Rym: The second is artists, but the vast majority of tablet pcs are terrible for drawing compared to like a waycom or a cintiq.

648
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,945
Scott: Yeah, well, here's the problem right?

649
00:43:47,046 --> 00:43:47,307
Scott: is that?

650
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:47,608
Scott: okay?

651
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:52,366
Scott: the waycom tablet even the you know, the cheapo waycom tablet Which doesn't which isn't a screen?

652
00:43:52,427 --> 00:43:55,620
Scott: It's just a touch pad right is good for artists.

653
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,092
Scott: It has the pressure sensitive pen thing and right, you know, and it's.

654
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:00,376
Scott: it's still pretty good.

655
00:44:00,476 --> 00:44:04,859
Scott: and you know, even the cheap one It's just smaller and it's not as good as the more expensive one.

656
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:07,787
Scott: Of course It's more expensive one is greatly superior, but it's still good.

657
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:15,280
Scott: The thing is the touchscreens on you know tablets and uh You know iphones, right?

658
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:22,980
Scott: They have the resistive touchscreens like the ds We have to use a stylus and they have capacitive touchscreens like the iphone where you have to use fingers and a stylus doesn't work.

659
00:44:23,722 --> 00:44:28,720
Scott: And the thing is capacitive touchscreens are very precise, but they can't really do pressure sensitivity.

660
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:34,626
Scott: All they can do is sort of, you know, multi-tracking of you know, multi-fingerness multi-touch And do it fast.

661
00:44:34,786 --> 00:44:36,271
Scott: Yeah, and they can do it precisely.

662
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:41,953
Scott: and they can tell taps apart from drags But they can't tell like hard and soft presses.

663
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:43,780
Scott: They have no idea really, you know.

664
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,270
Scott: So those don't really work for drawing.

665
00:44:47,691 --> 00:44:49,657
Scott: and the resistive ones, you know.

666
00:44:49,878 --> 00:44:53,374
Scott: or the you know Those don't really work for drawing either because they're so imprecise.

667
00:44:53,474 --> 00:44:57,975
Scott: only the waycom style Sort of electro ones where the pen has some magic in it.

668
00:44:58,336 --> 00:45:05,260
Scott: those ones Actually work for drawing but they never put those in the screen of any laptops ever part of it.

669
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,364
Rym: I mean look at a waycom.

670
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:07,287
Rym: there's no screen under.

671
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:11,365
Rym: they don't have to worry about like the durability of the screen anything like that Scratching it.

672
00:45:11,385 --> 00:45:11,708
Rym: Yep.

673
00:45:11,788 --> 00:45:13,300
Rym: It's just an input device.

674
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,960
Scott: Well, I was about to say they have the cintiq and the cintiq is exactly what you are saying.

675
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,575
Scott: It is the waycom screen on top of a monitor.

676
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:24,683
Scott: The problem is It's not a laptop or a tablet it's a monitor.

677
00:45:24,703 --> 00:45:32,060
Scott: you have to plug it into the wall and connect it to a computer with like a dvi cable and usb cable and It takes a lot of electricity and it's gigantic.

678
00:45:32,421 --> 00:45:38,560
Scott: You can't like bring this thing, you know around with you and walk around drawing trees or whatever you're gonna do, right?

679
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,995
Scott: You have to put it on your desk, you know, and it's it's your monitor.

680
00:45:43,055 --> 00:45:43,818
Scott: It's gigantic.

681
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:50,315
Scott: It's heavy It's expensive and I really don't understand why there really isn't a technological reason.

682
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:51,077
Scott: they couldn't put.

683
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:57,806
Scott: you know waycom Screens, you know on a laptop it can totally be done Uh, and they just don't.

684
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:07,900
Rym: well the one argument at least is that things like photoshop a lot of the software you would use If you're drawing is, you know, pretty heavy footprint relatively, especially, you know, manipulating large image files that sort of thing.

685
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:09,888
Scott: You so so you can make a lat.

686
00:46:09,908 --> 00:46:15,069
Scott: they have laptops core 2 duo 2 gigs of ram I mean solid-state drive you would put.

687
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,900
Rym: you can put a photoshop on there as light as my ultra portable.

688
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:20,310
Scott: It'd be like a normal 15-inch laptop.

689
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,945
Scott: Yeah, plus you'd want it to be a normal 15-inch laptop So you get more room to draw.

690
00:46:23,965 --> 00:46:28,919
Scott: it'd be harder to draw I imagine on like a tiny weird laptop, you know Like a netbook, you know have a lot of room on there now.

691
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:37,999
Rym: Well, you could go one step further and have the cintiqi style screen That can be detached and used as a cintiq style screen at home or you stick it to your laptop.

692
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:43,157
Scott: The thing is if you could do that you could sell that for a lot of money because it's sort of like.

693
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:54,840
Scott: hey this Not only is it a laptop, but you can plug this into your desktop computer And you won't need to buy a cintiq also so you can use this to draw On itself or on any other computer with a usb cable.

694
00:46:55,221 --> 00:47:00,520
Scott: You could probably charge fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars for that just because it's doing the work of two devices.

695
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:04,680
Rym: Yep, I guess that's the second market segment that really is not being addressed at all.

696
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:12,040
Scott: No, and there's a lot of money to be made there even though it's you know, it's it's a it's you know Definitely a vertical market of just artist people.

697
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,980
Scott: There's enough of them out there.

698
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:20,019
Scott: I think that if you made a product that just blew everyone away You'd pretty much sell one to every single one of those people no matter what.

699
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:24,600
Rym: And and plus it'd be kind of one of those obligatory purchases for people in certain markets.

700
00:47:25,013 --> 00:47:32,679
Rym: Yeah You might even have like situations where it's like like every film every like animation school Every like art school is gonna have to have these for their students.

701
00:47:32,941 --> 00:47:36,501
Scott: Yeah, like kids who are going to art school, you know, they would all you know It's like.

702
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,789
Scott: well which computer should I buy going to art school?

703
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,560
Scott: Well, duh the only one that's actually an art computer.

704
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,390
Scott: Now the third obviously the one to get market segment.

705
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:53,275
Rym: probably the easiest one to make a profit on Are the doctors the construction people the business people who basically need portable rapid.

706
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:55,000
Rym: I am walking around data entry.

707
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:56,892
Rym: These need to not run windows.

708
00:47:56,932 --> 00:48:05,820
Rym: They need to run a proprietary Operating system or something built on linux that has a very customizable plug-in style interface for data entry.

709
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,593
Scott: Well, I think the way to make money got to be cheap.

710
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:12,740
Rym: They got to be durable They got to be extensible and you got to get a bunch of third-party vendors on board to make stuff for them.

711
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:25,249
Scott: Well, I think the way to do this actually is not to make a tablet platform or maybe at least not Publicize the fact that it's a platform but instead to make custom devices sell, you know, dr pad and you just it's.

712
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:38,144
Scott: it's called the dr pad and that's it has Hospital software on it already and you sell it as part of a system because you're providing it to hospitals And you don't actually sell it, you know on newegg or whatever, you know It's companies.

713
00:48:38,184 --> 00:48:41,600
Scott: go around and make sales calls and try to sell this whole system to companies.

714
00:48:41,901 --> 00:48:45,562
Rym: There are a million things like this part of the yeah, but they're terrible They're.

715
00:48:45,602 --> 00:48:57,019
Rym: they use these custom non-tablet just horrible to use devices And it was easier for me when I worked at that hospital back in the day When I was trying to do an inventory I walked around holding a laptop that was open typing.

716
00:48:57,742 --> 00:49:02,314
Scott: I actually think you know apple basically only makes products for you know consumer stuff.

717
00:49:02,775 --> 00:49:06,028
Scott: if there was another company that came out I think there's even more you can make.

718
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:13,077
Scott: apple actually I think would make more money If they stopped making consumer devices all together just like well poop forget that right?

719
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:13,780
Scott: maybe you know.

720
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:31,268
Scott: Keep the ipod division open and what they would do is they would just go to different vertical markets And basically make a well-designed product because there are no well-designed vertical products And they would just dominate every vertical market one at a time by introducing a well-designed Market dominating thing into each and every one.

721
00:49:31,288 --> 00:49:34,459
Scott: and the best part is they basically and the money you make there is enterprise money.

722
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,490
Scott: That's not like, you know, hundred dollar ipod money.

723
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:40,803
Scott: This is like ten thousand dollars a piece of money You can make.

724
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:47,140
Rym: they could do the same thing that mobling and nintendo do Once you capture like two or three of these vertical markets.

725
00:49:47,581 --> 00:49:56,480
Rym: There is so much overlap in what each market requires that you basically did most of your work already And you could have a fairly small development team, you know, you've already made doctor.

726
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,995
Rym: basically what dentist pad so you can make.

727
00:49:59,015 --> 00:50:03,380
Rym: uh I kept thinking of fake doctor things like chiropractic and homeopathy.

728
00:50:03,661 --> 00:50:08,120
Scott: Yeah, basically what you would do is apple would spawn off a new company for each mark in each market.

729
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,305
Scott: So they would make apple.

730
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:21,869
Scott: they would make apple med and that would only make apple's Awesome design devices for medical verticals and they would be like apple, you know, uh Something else like one example charting.

731
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:30,840
Scott: once you apple restaurant and it would just be like, you know Apple point of sale machines for restaurants with the whole, you know Once you make the like charting is the hugest thing in hospitals.

732
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:33,800
Rym: That's hard for people to do reliably especially with technology.

733
00:50:34,283 --> 00:50:39,832
Rym: If you just made if you made the charting technology work There are like 10 separate vertical markets.

734
00:50:39,852 --> 00:50:41,238
Rym: you could take over with that alone.

735
00:50:41,399 --> 00:50:43,928
Scott: Yep And you know people just don't go for that.

736
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:55,480
Scott: That's why everything you ever that's why everything people use at work is horrible And poorly designed and terrible because the companies that know how to design things don't go into those markets And it's just these terrible old nasty companies.

737
00:50:56,101 --> 00:51:00,960
Scott: If someone hired some designers and went in to the verticals, they would rake in the dough.

738
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,201
Scott: There was

739
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:19,263
Rym: an article a long time ago about why you see certain kinds of businesses in certain places like in airports On military bases stuff like that and it had to do with the fact that The companies that get these large enterprise style contracts are not the companies that make the best product or have the best pitch or have The best price.

740
00:51:19,524 --> 00:51:23,320
Rym: they're the companies that have the best skill at negotiating the bureaucracy.

741
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:30,079
Rym: So their primary skill is getting into these big contracts not necessarily executing them Yep.

742
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:44,456
Scott: So if you could put together some people who could make a better quality product and also the people who are better at getting into These projects, you know contracts and navigating bureaucracies You could just pretty much blow every single competitor out of the water.

743
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:45,180
Scott: They have no chance.

744
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:56,640
Scott: This is why you know things like oracle and cisco have way more money than anyone else, you know Compared to say apple because you know or uh anyone cool because cool people can't do that kind of stuff.

745
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,580
Rym: Only the boring people can get in even though there's more money in the borrowing if you're willing to do the boring.

746
00:52:01,681 --> 00:52:03,192
Scott: But that's because no one that's.

747
00:52:03,212 --> 00:52:04,300
Scott: but no one does the boring.

748
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:13,966
Scott: Well, if that's I think the the biggest, you know You could take over the world be even bigger than google bigger than anyone else if you manage to be the first company To do the boring.

749
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,900
Rym: Well, this is what high school guidance counselors need to remind people.

750
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:21,500
Rym: They got to go to these kids and be like look You could be a professional juggler and live your life that way.

751
00:52:22,082 --> 00:52:24,575
Rym: Or you can make a ton of money by doing the boring shit.

752
00:52:24,615 --> 00:52:29,620
Rym: No one else wants to do Yep, and then retire at 30 and live with your millions and go juggle for fun.

753
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:35,140
Scott: Or you can work in a gas station because you guys you did terribly in school and you're obviously a moron.

754
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:39,400
Scott: That's all you're gonna be in life, I just hate to break it to you.

755
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,591
Scott: I know i'm supposed to worry about the self-esteem bullshit.

756
00:52:41,611 --> 00:52:43,039
Scott: But listen, you gotta face reality here.

757
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:45,326
Scott: kid The gas station.

758
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:47,754
Scott: maybe you could be the gas station manager and you know what.

759
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:51,146
Scott: if maybe you work at it learn some mechanics Maybe you can be the gas station owner.

760
00:52:51,347 --> 00:52:52,271
Scott: That's about it for you.

761
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:54,120
Rym: You know, there's another tack to take with those kids.

762
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:59,400
Rym: It's not a federal crime if you don't rob a federally protected institution.

763
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,524
Rym: Here's a mask.

764
00:53:00,825 --> 00:53:01,730
Rym: This is your best shot.

765
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,679
Scott: Yes, rob this non-federal credit union.

766
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,615
Scott: Rob this, you know illegal bookie or you know what kid.

767
00:53:09,655 --> 00:53:10,640
Scott: he's breaking the law, too.

768
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,242
Scott: He's not gonna call.

769
00:53:11,262 --> 00:53:11,805
Scott: you know what kid?

770
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:15,620
Rym: you got about a 20 chance of making it through college and coming out.

771
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,188
Rym: Okay, take all this college money you saved up Red or black.

772
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:26,732
Rym: you got better odds All right, all right, but so what's going on with apple?

773
00:53:26,772 --> 00:53:28,740
Rym: because they've you know, they're gonna announce all their shit.

774
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,130
Rym: I'm not even gonna bother i'm gonna predict right now.

775
00:53:31,571 --> 00:53:33,740
Rym: They're catering to the first market.

776
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,229
Rym: We talked about shiny useless bullshit.

777
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,040
Rym: their tablet is going to be a gigantic ipod touch.

778
00:53:39,602 --> 00:53:43,558
Rym: Probably now it's going to be between the ipod touch and the iphone touch.

779
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:46,627
Rym: Here's the thing They're gonna have like one pseudo killer app.

780
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:50,820
Rym: Like it's also a universal remote that synchronizes with all your apple stuff.

781
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:54,299
Rym: Yeah, probably and maybe it'll even sync over the air, but that's it.

782
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,755
Scott: Well, the thing is right even though they will probably just cater to that first market.

783
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:07,778
Scott: there is actually A reason that I would want a tablet and this is something, you know I know exactly what you're gonna say and it overlaps with the shiny thing market.

784
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:08,280
Scott: No, it doesn't.

785
00:54:08,381 --> 00:54:09,209
Rym: I think it does a little bit.

786
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:10,300
Scott: What do you think i'm gonna say?

787
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,296
Rym: You're gonna say you want something you can lay down in bed and surf the web.

788
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:13,678
Rym: That's right.

789
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:24,660
Scott: That's right, because right look at this I wake up in the morning, you know And if you're in your bed or on your couch You people have laptops and netbooks and things but they're uncomfortable.

790
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:32,772
Rym: That's why you see people with like the snuggie and the weird little like pillow that holds the laptop on a tray But even then it sucks your wrist start hurting.

791
00:54:32,832 --> 00:54:34,120
Scott: It's just not comfortable, right?

792
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,660
Scott: And pre also like on a on a on a plane on a train.

793
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,410
Scott: It's not comfortable to use a laptop and i'm not doing.

794
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:44,505
Scott: if i'm doing coding or if i'm doing writing something I need the keyboard.

795
00:54:44,525 --> 00:54:45,450
Scott: I need to swing it out.

796
00:54:45,731 --> 00:54:47,640
Scott: But if i'm not I don't need the keyboard.

797
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,205
Scott: It's just making things uncomfortable.

798
00:54:49,607 --> 00:54:58,080
Scott: and basically a big ipod touch would be pretty good for those situations You know because I basically lay in bed with the iphone but it's small and it sucks and it's uncomfortable.

799
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:05,614
Scott: so the thing is Is you know a lot of times, you know, my ipod is too small.

800
00:55:05,715 --> 00:55:06,497
Scott: i'm in my house.

801
00:55:06,618 --> 00:55:07,220
Scott: So what do I do?

802
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,035
Scott: If I want to like browse the web with the computer attached to the tv.

803
00:55:11,055 --> 00:55:15,517
Scott: now i've got to use like You know a keyboard and a mouse all the way over to the tv.

804
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:16,724
Scott: that sucks Right.

805
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:19,360
Scott: or I can go sit at my computer, but i'm sitting at a desk.

806
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:21,580
Scott: It's not as comfortable as lying on a couch.

807
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:24,151
Scott: Well, I only want to sit at the desk to do work.

808
00:55:24,653 --> 00:55:27,651
Scott: or you know something like, you know Playing fps where I need a mouse.

809
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:28,740
Rym: Here's what I have to say about this.

810
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:40,960
Rym: All this is is very simply a convergence between iphone and kindle And when those two things combine it's basically either what apple is making or what all that technology is going to converge upon.

811
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:49,382
Scott: So the world does need I think You know some sort of computer that you can use from the couch or the bed or wherever Right.

812
00:55:49,402 --> 00:55:51,629
Scott: that doesn't have this stupid keyboard always in the way.

813
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:52,773
Scott: the thing is.

814
00:55:52,793 --> 00:55:54,880
Scott: I think the product apple will make.

815
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:59,859
Scott: You know regardless of any other rumors if they even come out with a tablet who knows maybe they'll come out with like.

816
00:56:00,182 --> 00:56:01,839
Scott: You know the apple poop on a stick.

817
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:05,474
Rym: Right, I poop I poop every day every day.

818
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:15,716
Scott: Um, right Regardless of what they come out with it could be You know, it might be too limited as apple products always are.

819
00:56:15,736 --> 00:56:16,640
Rym: they're going to announce it.

820
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,644
Rym: It's going to be really shiny.

821
00:56:17,664 --> 00:56:18,186
Rym: It'll look great.

822
00:56:18,548 --> 00:56:21,340
Rym: They'll announce one, you know, pseudo killer app.

823
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,120
Rym: That's just killer enough to where the people who are waiting for it are gonna buy no matter what.

824
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,095
Rym: Yeah, and then they'll have one half like half.

825
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:31,594
Scott: It could be like the apple tv where it just doesn't have enough functionality.

826
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:33,140
Scott: It's you know, it can't do everything.

827
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,560
Rym: I'll bet they're pseudo like their secondary thing not their main killer app.

828
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:39,039
Rym: I'm, not sure what the main quote unquote killer app is going to be.

829
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:43,202
Rym: I think the secondary thing is they're going to have some sort of like e-reader Like.

830
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,900
Rym: it'll do what a kindle does but you know you can do it.

831
00:56:46,021 --> 00:56:53,092
Scott: Yeah, they'll be like well it reads books and magazines in full color and has a great You know touch screen user interface for doing so and all those books and magazines.

832
00:56:53,193 --> 00:56:54,136
Rym: It'll cost money.

833
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:58,390
Scott: and our drm It'll probably and has a web browser, but the web browser doesn't have flash.

834
00:56:58,471 --> 00:57:06,040
Rym: It'll probably run itunes natively and It'll like do all the media stuff natively but also sync up with all your apple stuff in your house.

835
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:14,421
Scott: Yeah, it's just gonna be like well it can do all this cool stuff but only if you have other apple stuff and only if you buy movies on whatever and it's You know.

836
00:57:14,582 --> 00:57:22,220
Scott: if it's too limited it's probably gonna have this great interface and it'll probably Theoretically have all that awesome functionality that I want to be there.

837
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:31,313
Scott: But that all that awesome functionality Will probably be missing a few things that annoyed the hell out of everyone like no copy paste and you know What they're gonna do and it's only gonna really work 100 perfectly.

838
00:57:31,373 --> 00:57:35,000
Scott: if everything in your house is apple They're gonna buy all your media from apple.

839
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:37,532
Rym: They're just gonna wait until a competitor appears.

840
00:57:37,593 --> 00:57:39,060
Rym: that does those other things, right?

841
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,468
Rym: And then suddenly all those features will appear like they always do.

842
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:43,415
Scott: Yeah, see i'm hoping right.

843
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:55,040
Scott: i'm beginning to gain more Hope that the there are other companies that can actually come out and design something You know as well as apple has designed it while also providing all the necessary functionality.

844
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:59,720
Scott: If you looked at how boxy totally shredded the apple tv times a billion, right?

845
00:57:59,881 --> 00:58:03,799
Scott: The thing is boxy's actually probably selling more mac minis than apple is.

846
00:58:04,913 --> 00:58:08,872
Scott: um You know, but their boxy box should actually do a lot to stop that right.

847
00:58:08,912 --> 00:58:11,040
Scott: and the roku not a bad user interface either.

848
00:58:11,181 --> 00:58:14,236
Scott: Yeah, they split out the xbox 360 windows media center.

849
00:58:14,276 --> 00:58:15,060
Scott: pretty good, right?

850
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,338
Rym: I'm glad I got the original roku.

851
00:58:16,379 --> 00:58:21,360
Rym: now They have like the the non hd version the hd version the 802 like all these different versions.

852
00:58:22,221 --> 00:58:26,517
Rym: Mine because I got it originally is cheaper than the biggest version has everything that one has except 802 11n.

853
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:31,180
Scott: Ah, yeah, I think you know, so We'll see what happens here.

854
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:37,779
Scott: but I definitely you know I am sort of looking for a computer that I can just use on the from the couch or the bed.

855
00:58:37,819 --> 00:58:40,470
Scott: because You know, I I see I have no interest.

856
00:58:40,631 --> 00:58:42,600
Scott: people always think about this tablet like bringing it places.

857
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:48,120
Scott: I really I would only probably bring it if I was going on a trip, you know to read stuff on a plane or something.

858
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:50,493
Scott: I would probably never bring it You know to.

859
00:58:51,701 --> 00:58:53,309
Rym: You know, I wouldn't bring it on the train.

860
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,500
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't bring it to work or around town.

861
00:58:56,444 --> 00:59:00,180
Rym: The only reason I don't buy a netbook and carry that everywhere with me is because I own an ultra portable.

862
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:01,834
Rym: That's not that much bigger than a netbook.

863
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:14,970
Scott: Yeah Um, but yeah I definitely am looking for a way to like read some websites From my couch as opposed to having to go sit at my desk all the time It is going to be I I predict about a year.

864
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:21,200
Scott: read some web comics from my couch read comics from my couch Which yeah, which I can do already but non-paper comics.

865
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:23,960
Rym: It's going to be about a year and a half before what you want exists.

866
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:25,870
Scott: That's my prediction, but I am looking for it.

867
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:26,796
Scott: And you know what?

868
00:59:26,876 --> 00:59:35,541
Scott: There is a Very very very very very tiny chance that maybe apple will just be like, yeah, we made this totally awesome open tablet platform with My.

869
00:59:35,682 --> 00:59:42,200
Rym: I mean it's gonna fall short in in the in the exact same distance from glory that nintendo and apple always do.

870
00:59:42,723 --> 00:59:48,900
Rym: They come just high enough to where you want it But not high enough to where it's good enough to do what we really wanted to do.

871
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:59,442
Scott: Also, it seems that a lot of rumors are pointing heavily towards some sort of you know Cellular connection right so that you'll you know, it'll connect to at and t or verizon or something And then

872
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,051
Rym: they'll suck they'll solve the wrong problem

873
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:08,476
Scott: They'll subsidize the cost of the tablet and you just pay like 30 bucks a month so that you can write.

874
01:00:08,697 --> 01:00:16,609
Scott: it's like, uh, no Sorry, I really have no interest in having this connect to the cell phone network because it's never leaving my house ever Right, and

875
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,931
Rym: clearly

876
01:00:16,972 --> 01:00:22,740
Scott: I have no interest in you know Getting cellular data to it because anything I want to put on it i'll put on it with a usb stick.

877
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:28,838
Rym: Like i'm saying apple and nintendo will very often solve the wrong problem and everyone forgets what their original problem was.

878
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:32,539
Scott: Yeah Uh, they just they bombed the wrong place.

879
01:00:34,982 --> 01:00:39,520
Rym: So my prediction is I will be disappointed and sales are going to be really high for this thing.

880
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,087
Rym: It's probably going to sell out whatever it is.

881
01:00:41,168 --> 01:00:41,811
Scott: I don't know about that.

882
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:46,751
Scott: My prediction is it'll be about Equal to macbook air right?

883
01:00:46,832 --> 01:00:58,254
Scott: It's going to be sort of like, you know Whoa, it's incredibly thin and there's a few things that are really cool about it and interesting and whoa, look at that You know, there's a feature there and a piece of software there that I really wish I had.

884
01:00:58,294 --> 01:01:08,655
Scott: those few things are awesome But the whole package too much money and or Has things I don't want and is not really something i'm gonna buy.

885
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:13,620
Scott: when you summon all interesting this This doesn't matter to apple and it's going to be too closed too close.

886
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,108
Rym: This doesn't matter to me in regards to apple.

887
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,560
Rym: what this is causing me to do is not go out and buy it or whatever.

888
01:01:20,281 --> 01:01:33,780
Rym: The fact that this is coming out is causing me to not buy a kindle or a nook Because I realized after they announced this that all these technologies are converging And i'm not going to buy any product in any of those like lines until they converge on some sort of.

889
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:42,235
Rym: Hey, you know the the thing that is a kindle and is a tablet and is all these things and never leaves my house And i'll put two of them in the library.

890
01:01:42,255 --> 01:01:42,899
Rym: and that's the end of it.

891
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,028
Scott: Yeah, I have no plans to buy any of these.

892
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:48,321
Rym: that is the product I will buy and it will come out in about 1.5 Years.

893
01:01:48,361 --> 01:01:55,330
Scott: if you had not noticed I have not been bought or planned to buy any of those things either, you know Because I need openness I need you know, I can't.

894
01:01:55,351 --> 01:01:56,154
Scott: the technology's not.

895
01:01:56,174 --> 01:01:59,304
Scott: it's like look at this right with The ipod right.

896
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:09,380
Scott: the ipod is the thing that apple needs to learn from right because they made it so they should know That the only reason the ipod succeeded right at all is because it could just play fucking mp3s.

897
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:17,809
Scott: Right if the ipod cannot play mp3s and could only and was limited only to the drm Music files in the itunes store.

898
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,635
Scott: The ipod would have been a bust.

899
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:20,940
Scott: It would have not gone anywhere.

900
01:02:21,141 --> 01:02:22,869
Scott: Nobody would have bought one ever.

901
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:25,180
Scott: It would have been a flop, right?

902
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:29,850
Scott: But now when they make something like, you know the iphone.

903
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:33,480
Scott: Oh, well, you can only make apps that we approve, you know.

904
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:42,696
Scott: It's like uh, you realize if you made the iphone so that it could just run any app Android and palm and blackberry would basically all be at zero.

905
01:02:42,776 --> 01:02:49,860
Scott: now as opposed to Slightly competing with you and ganging up on you and such it, you know, it's like oh, we're doing just fine.

906
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:56,120
Scott: We sold a bajillion abs, you know, it's like you would have sold, you know, and they think oh Well, if we would have made it open we wouldn't have sold that.

907
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,980
Scott: No, if you would have made it open you would have had 100 market dominance, you know.

908
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:32,520
Rym: I can sum this up really simply unless you have money to burn Never buy a technological gadget style product when it is clearly on a convergence course course with some other products in the same line because whenever there are two products converging The point at which they converge is where you want to be because that is where suddenly Like all this functionality opens up like web 2.0 When suddenly like the social stuff merged with the static pages merged with the hosted cloud stuff Suddenly all the crazy ideas were just like common sense and just all happened at once.

909
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:34,689
Scott: See, this is why the apple tv failed.

910
01:03:34,749 --> 01:03:38,324
Scott: the apple tv right was limited in functionality It can only do.

911
01:03:38,344 --> 01:03:41,520
Scott: it can only interact with the things you bought on itunes and such and such.

912
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,818
Scott: Well, because media centers whereas the boxy could do everything and that's why the boxy is the win.

913
01:03:46,858 --> 01:03:52,340
Scott: it can play Youtubes you can visit hulu.com in it even though the hulu app is sort of gone, but you can you know?

914
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:56,574
Rym: Because dvrs and media centers and all those things were all converging toward one point.

915
01:03:56,634 --> 01:04:04,220
Rym: and we're just about to be at the point Of perfect convergence, yep at which everyone will buy the perfect product at that time or maybe they'll be two competitors.

916
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:12,070
Scott: So apple needs to learn that lesson and they need to make the tablet be able to just read, you know Free ebooks from whatever they don't.

917
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:15,966
Rym: they don't need to do it at all because what they need to do now Is make their product.

918
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:18,599
Rym: that is on the convergence path, but not there.

919
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:18,840
Rym: yet.

920
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:28,960
Rym: All the people who don't realize this are going to buy it now and then they're going to add functionality Just as the convergence is happening to maintain their market share and people like us wait until the convergence.

921
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,254
Scott: Yeah, but you see this is where it's like.

922
01:04:31,294 --> 01:04:32,239
Scott: yes that will work.

923
01:04:32,481 --> 01:04:33,933
Scott: Yes, that will make them a lot of money.

924
01:04:34,014 --> 01:04:39,366
Scott: But the thing is They could make a billion times more money If they just went.

925
01:04:39,386 --> 01:04:47,727
Scott: if you just it's like oh, we don't need to score a goal now Let's just go to like center ice and hang out, you know, you know, all right, let's move it Let's go across the blue line and hang out.

926
01:04:47,747 --> 01:04:49,895
Scott: It's like just score the goal now.

927
01:04:49,915 --> 01:04:50,980
Scott: What are you waiting for?

928
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:51,803
Rym: It's more of a risk.

929
01:04:51,863 --> 01:04:56,300
Rym: It's not as guaranteed because the convergence line, you know, it's an empty net.

930
01:04:56,663 --> 01:04:57,774
Scott: It's not like the goal.

931
01:04:57,815 --> 01:04:58,280
Scott: He's there.

932
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,226
Rym: You got to understand.

933
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:02,417
Rym: with a business all these lines are converging.

934
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:10,698
Rym: on a point If you take one of those lines and you think you know where they're all going to converge and you jump all the way out There early you might just have made another newton.

935
01:05:11,288 --> 01:05:18,920
Rym: No and remember also apples changed a lot and the the apple of today is not the old wasniac kind of apple of.

936
01:05:19,303 --> 01:05:34,659
Rym: Let's just go for it and make a newton They're not going to go for it and make the convergence point which has a risk and a high possible payoff When they can do the follow the convergence line and wait until other people force us to change And make guaranteed money all along that line.

937
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:37,006
Scott: They can make more guaranteed money.

938
01:05:37,026 --> 01:05:42,313
Rym: if they listen to me guaranteed money now is worth more than slightly risky money Later to the vast majority of investors.

939
01:05:42,555 --> 01:05:45,999
Rym: I disagree But that's why I invest in the companies I invest in.

940
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:53,474
Scott: Uh, if I was in charge, uh, you know, and I had some resources I would i'll admit I would not invest in apple.

941
01:05:53,494 --> 01:05:57,573
Rym: if you were in charge in apple I would invest in competitors to apple.

942
01:05:57,794 --> 01:05:57,975
Scott: Why?

943
01:05:58,055 --> 01:05:59,040
Rym: so I don't know.

944
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:02,140
Rym: I I don't think the market would be kind to that sort of risk.

945
01:06:02,682 --> 01:06:07,700
Rym: And right now I think it's too soon to jump to the convergence point because I think well, well, here's an example, right?

946
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:08,321
Scott: All right.

947
01:06:08,401 --> 01:06:11,232
Scott: So right now, uh apple computer, right?

948
01:06:11,292 --> 01:06:13,420
Scott: What's what's the actual market share of max?

949
01:06:13,581 --> 01:06:14,687
Scott: It's like less than 10 percent.

950
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:16,920
Scott: It's you know, I mean you see a lot of them out there.

951
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,565
Rym: I'm talking about just the tablet thing.

952
01:06:18,605 --> 01:06:19,649
Rym: What's the point of convergence?

953
01:06:19,929 --> 01:06:27,960
Rym: It might be between tablet pc and Uh kindle nook kind of thing, but it might be a three-way convergence also with cell phone.

954
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:32,780
Rym: It might be a four-way convergence also with augmented reality and that's the wild card.

955
01:06:33,181 --> 01:06:40,799
Rym: If augmented reality comes up faster than anyone expects then the conversion point gets pushed a lot further out and is a lot more important to society.

956
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:57,100
Rym: Hmm I mean if deno coil happens But not too long after the conversion point that apple would jump to if you were in charge Apple's fucked at that point because they've made a future newton and it's totally made obsolete 10 minutes later by deno coil.

957
01:06:58,062 --> 01:07:01,460
Scott: Yeah, but I mean it's like if someone else is working on that already.

958
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:12,348
Scott: It doesn't matter what you make now because the the tablet they release now whether it's a whether it's good or double plus good If deno coil comes out tomorrow It's fail either way.

959
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:14,120
Scott: that has nothing to you know, that makes no difference.

960
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:18,398
Rym: I like how you say something like double plus good, especially thinking back to old apple advertising.

961
01:07:18,819 --> 01:07:19,973
Scott: Yeah What do you think i'm doing here?

962
01:07:19,993 --> 01:07:20,398
Scott: stuff?

963
01:07:21,442 --> 01:07:22,166
Rym: Yeah, I got you.

964
01:07:22,186 --> 01:07:22,327
Rym: I don't.

965
01:07:22,488 --> 01:07:24,319
Rym: I don't know how many people would have caught that out there.

966
01:07:24,803 --> 01:07:26,091
Scott: Don't don't give it away.

967
01:07:26,192 --> 01:07:27,077
Scott: It just ruins it.

968
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:42,655
Rym: But the the real trick where you want to be is you've got to be the dark horse that forces the convergence line way out Which used to happen a lot more often from companies like apple and I don't know where it's going to come from right now.

969
01:07:42,695 --> 01:07:53,567
Rym: It might be google It might be someone out of nowhere But i'm waiting for the dark horse to suddenly announce some crazy like altered virtual reality kind of technology That just throws everybody off their game.

970
01:07:53,788 --> 01:07:59,840
Scott: I think the big problem is that just there aren't enough Product, you know quality product designers in the world.

971
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:13,329
Rym: There's a lot of people out there who can sort of get the right idea about something into a situation where there's not enough Talent in a lot of industries and it's surprising how hard it is to get skilled people Above a certain line in all levels of technology.

972
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:24,700
Scott: Yeah, there's just you know, so it's like apple has these designers and And nobody else, you know, even if they can you know, look at look at make the computer kde or gnome.

973
01:08:24,841 --> 01:08:27,618
Rym: They are not uh, the best interfaces in the world.

974
01:08:28,001 --> 01:08:29,225
Scott: Yeah, people just can't.

975
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,714
Scott: they just aren't people available to do this.

976
01:08:31,754 --> 01:08:33,460
Scott: no matter how much money you're willing to spend.

977
01:08:34,162 --> 01:08:42,546
Scott: It's like all these people already have jobs working at places like, you know, palm and apple and wherever And you just can't get a designer.

978
01:08:42,607 --> 01:08:44,131
Scott: They just they don't do not exist.

979
01:08:44,152 --> 01:08:47,546
Scott: There aren't enough of them, you know, and They're.

980
01:08:47,688 --> 01:08:55,920
Scott: even if you have bajillion dollars They're not going to switch jobs or you know It will take so many bazillion dollars to hire them that you can't get anyone else.

981
01:08:56,461 --> 01:08:59,149
Scott: And therefore even if you have all the right ideas, aha.

982
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:02,439
Scott: This is the exact specifications for a product that is going to win.

983
01:09:03,301 --> 01:09:06,658
Scott: It just can't happen because you can't get the people that can make it exist.

984
01:09:07,081 --> 01:09:08,165
Rym: well, what would be interesting.

985
01:09:08,285 --> 01:09:10,332
Rym: imagine if this is getting way out there we should.

986
01:09:10,853 --> 01:09:14,825
Scott: or also you can't even get the uh, The economy of scale at the factories.

987
01:09:15,066 --> 01:09:31,091
Rym: imagine if what we did is at a much broader level forced through political reform To make education in america better to the point that it found anyone with the capability to succeed In you know, very specific and crazy areas and gave them everything they needed to succeed.

988
01:09:31,473 --> 01:09:34,020
Rym: and you you greatly raised the bar.

989
01:09:34,381 --> 01:09:39,359
Rym: Like right now we've got this like, you know less than one percent of you know, ultra geniuses in any given field.

990
01:09:39,761 --> 01:09:45,160
Rym: Then you've got like the one percent of the really skilled people and then there's this sharp drop off after that.

991
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:55,507
Rym: What if 25 of it people were at my level and then instead of there being like 0.1 above what I do There was 0.0001?

992
01:09:55,507 --> 01:10:01,869
Rym: because there's so much more pool talent at the like high-end pool That you've raised the bar on the low level.

993
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:07,832
Scott: all those talented people would be paid and appreciated a lot lot less Yes, but at the same time the total output would increase a lot.

994
01:10:07,852 --> 01:10:10,359
Rym: You've raised the bar of society heavily Yes.

995
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:17,059
Scott: So the result of that the gdp would greatly increase due to the increased output and the people at the top would make a whole lot more money.

996
01:10:17,723 --> 01:10:22,640
Scott: But because you know, no individual worker to be more skilled than the other workers They wouldn't be paid significant.

997
01:10:22,781 --> 01:10:30,048
Rym: That is the problem of the more you increase the average skill the more you decrease the value of the work In the current basic economic system we have.

998
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:33,920
Rym: obviously you could try different systems, but uh everything we try fails.

999
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:41,353
Rym: Yeah, but if we could solve that well, you know if we could solve that the allocation of scarce resources We saw yes, it's turtles all the way down.

1000
01:10:41,373 --> 01:10:42,519
Rym: We know I think we're done.

1001
01:10:48,942 --> 01:10:51,480
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
