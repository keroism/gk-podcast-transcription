1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,298
Rym: It's Monday, December 13th.

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:12,020
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:20,507
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight in the year of our Lord 2010 we talked about Abstraction.

4
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:24,237
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:32,258
Scott: So apparently Rym tells me that he is illicitly modifying the shows.

6
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:34,929
Scott: GeekNights what evidence have you?

7
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:35,972
Scott: you just said so.

8
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:37,879
Scott: when prove it a minute ago?

9
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:43,300
Rym: If I go back to the audio record it appears that a minute ago, there is no audio.

10
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:48,720
Scott: Well, you know I could just go and get any of the mp3s and I could listen to them until I hear shit.

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,463
Rym: The Marantz was not.

12
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:53,019
Scott: I got to delete that until I hear some illicit edits that you may have made.

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:04,391
Scott: So if anyone you know if you are misjudging you may be misjudging Rym Falsely positively and misjudging me falsely negatively.

14
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,240
Rym: What kind of edit do you think I could have made?

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,720
Rym: It's not like I can really do like add words that you said you could cut out.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,596
Scott: Yeah, you know I've said pretty much almost every word in my vocabulary through the course of this show so you could cut and paste them together Making me say pretty much anything.

17
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,879
Rym: That'd be way too much effort.

18
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:25,795
Scott: I'm just saying you admitted to illicitly adding things to the show one.

19
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,878
Rym: You have no evidence of that.

20
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:29,423
Rym: and to And to.

21
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:33,879
Rym: the last time I did that was when you were chewing that just admitted that you're gonna do it.

22
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:38,220
Rym: But you were chewing that goddamn gum, I edited out like two minutes of you gum smacking.

23
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,652
Rym: Well, come on, I replaced it with me saying Scott was chewing gum for two minutes.

24
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:43,514
Scott: Yeah, I don't do that.

25
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:45,039
Rym: Nah, no, nah.

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,894
Rym: Anyway, maybe if you learn audition and audio engineering you could take this over.

27
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:51,937
Scott: It's not I haven't just.

28
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:52,780
Scott: I just wouldn't care.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,344
Rym: I'll just send you.

30
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:55,880
Rym: I'll just send you the raw wave and then you can edit it together.

31
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:57,699
Scott: I'll just turn it into mp3 and upload it.

32
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,757
Rym: Well with like five minutes of us arguing about what the show's gonna be on.

33
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:06,940
Scott: Yeah Because then people will see the truth, you know, we saw an edited truth.

34
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,210
Rym: we said we were gonna do that a long time ago and we never did.

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:18,863
Rym: if do one special show where we just record the Whole conversation before and after the show and then like we put up that week the show and then the next week We put up the making of.

36
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:22,834
Scott: yeah, there's not much making of just now there was not really.

37
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:27,356
Rym: apparently you have all these accusations Wild accusation that you just admitted to.

38
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:27,920
Scott: you confessed.

39
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,591
Rym: Oh cuz you think I'm not gonna edit that out.

40
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,820
Scott: you confessed to the comfy chair.

41
00:02:33,523 --> 00:02:35,029
Rym: You realize I could edit this whole thing out.

42
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,414
Rym: I could start the show right now.

43
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:51,620
Scott: Yeah anyway So, you know, I got all kinds of Arduino and electronic stuff and I did never really, you know Like I did a whole bunch of just you know, follow the instructions kind of things to make stuff But I didn't really make anything on my own initiative because they didn't really have an idea.

44
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:56,260
Rym: It's kind of like when I learned to cut like I had to learn C sharp to do a web service at work.

45
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:59,214
Rym: So I made kind of half of a program.

46
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:03,069
Rym: cuz I thought oh, I'll make my own Like I'll make a shitty little ticketing system just to learn.

47
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,940
Rym: and I got I don't know a day into that and I just stopped.

48
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:15,413
Scott: yeah, so But I actually have something I want to make and I'm gonna make it and the thing that's good about it is it's mostly crafty Right, the actual electronic part is like five minutes almost right?

49
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:17,040
Scott: So here's what I'm gonna make ready.

50
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:19,731
Scott: Remember that thing the shocking roulette.

51
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,380
Scott: you put your finger in it and go dig it again.

52
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:27,239
Rym: We thought about buying that at RIT to decide who goes first in Puerto Rico, well, that's the point of it, right?

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,924
Scott: But I got a better idea.

54
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:32,036
Scott: I'm gonna make pretty much the same thing with an airsoft gun.

55
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:33,160
Scott: That's a good idea.

56
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,224
Rym: Same thing with rat tracks.

57
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,287
Scott: It's not a bad idea.

58
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:40,704
Scott: I'm gonna make basically as small as possible the ultimate Boardgame gadget.

59
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:43,840
Scott: right and what it's gonna do is gonna do many things that you need in board game.

60
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,780
Rym: All I need is a turn taker timer.

61
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:52,880
Scott: Okay, it's gonna have turn taking timing with chess turn taking timing mode for multiplayer to like a players.

62
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,174
Scott: Oh, it's gonna have a lot of players tons, right?

63
00:03:55,596 --> 00:04:03,388
Scott: It's gonna have Choose a player at random for whatever you might need to do that, you know going first turn, you know all kinds of stuff right.

64
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:07,747
Scott: it's gonna have Forget the other things.

65
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,500
Scott: I was gonna have not much else apparently.

66
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:14,320
Scott: Oh, it's gonna have like money counting for games or you don't want to use the stupid paper money.

67
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,560
Scott: You can actually have money for each person, right?

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,324
Rym: So and so how?

69
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:19,672
Rym: so this is just software.

70
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,920
Rym: then what do you need the Arduino for?

71
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,485
Scott: Well, cuz it'll be a nice little.

72
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:25,940
Scott: it won't be just like a computer program on your you know, laptop.

73
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,574
Rym: I mean what am I gonna put it on the money counter monopolies.

74
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:29,178
Rym: when I pull a 500 out?

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,559
Rym: It says Rym has taken 500 monopoly dollars.

76
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:39,130
Scott: They'll just be like, you know up and down You know, I mean you could do.

77
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:46,570
Rym: I mean I used to do that when as a kid I'd always sit there with my calculator and I would do all my money and that's how I would do it Do and then everyone else would accuse me of cheating.

78
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,142
Scott: Yeah, those one other thing I was gonna have.

79
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,445
Scott: turn time taking.

80
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,611
Scott: choose player at random shocking.

81
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:53,915
Scott: No shocking.

82
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:54,596
Rym: Why not?

83
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:55,880
Rym: The shocking is all I wanted.

84
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,491
Rym: I didn't care about the random.

85
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:58,417
Scott: I could roll a frickin.

86
00:04:58,477 --> 00:05:02,553
Scott: Oh Quizbowl buzzing in like D. Ah, I cuz independently.

87
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,200
Rym: I was actually thinking about just buy.

88
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:06,940
Rym: I thought about making one and then I saw that they're so cheap.

89
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,478
Scott: Anyway, you could read like the same LEDs that will like one of them will light up to say who you know.

90
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:13,462
Scott: choose player at Random.

91
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:16,940
Scott: you could use those same ones for who buzzed first, you know.

92
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,080
Scott: So it's got a lot of reuse going on and they can make it a just nice small little compact thing.

93
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,820
Scott: So you keep it in your bag and we go to play a board game.

94
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,940
Scott: You just put it in the middle of the table and it's just got a little 16x2 LCD screen and a bunch of LEDs and some buttons.

95
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:32,464
Rym: See I was thinking about making just the quiz bowl thing because I you know I knew how to make them.

96
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:36,383
Rym: I help people make them for my high school all the time because we couldn't afford to buy the One so we'd make.

97
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:41,040
Scott: no this will be money-saving right because you don't need any more electronics to add these extra purposes.

98
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:48,515
Scott: You know, you have the same number of buttons and the same number of LEDs But you just add extra software and you get more functionality out of the same hardware.

99
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:50,040
Rym: You really need the shocking though.

100
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,487
Scott: The shocking requires extra hardware.

101
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:57,180
Rym: Yeah, just a monetizer on it spins in a circle and shoots.

102
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:01,623
Scott: That's all you I'm gonna do.

103
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:02,186
Scott: LEDs.

104
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:03,633
Rym: You ever put your finger in that shocking thing.

105
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:04,920
Scott: It actually kind of hurts.

106
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:16,980
Scott: I've done the one where you You know you have the the metal twisted wire and you get the hoop and you try to guide the hoop along the wire without touching the Wire with the hoop and you put your finger on a thing and if you mess up it will shock you.

107
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,872
Scott: Well, if your fingers are also on the shocking pad, I've done that.

108
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:26,987
Rym: I Could see this being useful but the reason I didn't actually make one was that it's Cheaper to buy one.

109
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:27,530
Rym: if I can't.

110
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:31,128
Rym: even if it takes me like a half-hour to make it It's cheaper to just buy one by what.

111
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,931
Scott: a quiz bowl buzzer like 40 bucks Arduino and one Arduino is 30 bucks.

112
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:38,533
Scott: It's pretty close.

113
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:38,835
Scott: Yeah.

114
00:06:39,136 --> 00:06:40,331
Rym: Yeah, plus it depends I mean.

115
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,122
Scott: But the thing is.

116
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:48,530
Rym: but can get the fancy quiz bowl ones that have like the different lights for teams multi-team interaction Networking them across room.

117
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:50,000
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna have to go and try to you know.

118
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,200
Scott: The thing is I have to scavenge up like some good buttons that are good for hitting.

119
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,972
Scott: I'm thinking I might get that that thing from staples.

120
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:56,855
Scott: What's that?

121
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,920
Scott: You know the red easy button?

122
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,128
Rym: Yeah, you can get better buttons.

123
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:01,232
Scott: I need a good though.

124
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:03,300
Scott: No, that's good that you can hit hard and frequently.

125
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,869
Rym: I'll show you some places to get buttons.

126
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,780
Rym: You know, I've said this sounds dumb.

127
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:10,371
Rym: I actually do have good knowledge on buttons specifically.

128
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,240
Rym: I know I remember when I made that hard DDR pad.

129
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:16,520
Scott: Yeah, well, I need something that you can punch with your fist and has a nice cable on it.

130
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,074
Rym: Yeah, I did a lot of research into switches and buttons And you know ribbon switches are actually what you want.

131
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:28,195
Rym: if you want to make a DDR pad Just a long ribbon and if you squeeze it anywhere it goes off.

132
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:28,877
Rym: Uh-huh.

133
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:30,684
Rym: Yeah All right.

134
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:34,680
Rym: So the news apparently is Gawker which is something I mostly ignore.

135
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:37,300
Scott: Well, so Gawker if you don't realize this, right?

136
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,880
Scott: There's a whole bunch of blogs out in the world.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:55,772
Scott: Some of the most popular blogs actually are part of this company called Gawker media and they're actually in New York And the company consists of many blogs such as Gawker Kotaku Gizmodo io 9 And a bunch of other ones that I remember.

138
00:07:55,893 --> 00:08:01,374
Scott: Yeah life hacker life hacker I think apparently flesh bot if let's bust the porn blog.

139
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,120
Scott: Yes, basically just porn.

140
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,649
Scott: It's not even really a blog.

141
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,527
Scott: doesn't have stories about the porn industry Just has hey check out this porn.

142
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:10,654
Rym: that spin is spawned on the Wikipedia page.

143
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:12,179
Rym: Jezebel for celebrity sex.

144
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:15,814
Scott: Yeah, great basically, you know company.

145
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:19,748
Scott: yeah anyway Pretty much the only Gawker thing.

146
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:36,798
Scott: I even pay attention to is Kotaku and the only reason I Prefer Kotaku over joystick is because I think joystick is you know, while it's high quality Kotaku Definitely focuses more on like, you know, the Japan stuff because they actually have people in Japan So that that helps them but all the other Gawker blogs that can give shit about.

147
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:40,554
Scott: but anyway They fucked up right at Gawker.

148
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:41,460
Rym: now you fucked up.

149
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:45,640
Scott: They fucked up big time in the security department of computers.

150
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:58,224
Scott: So what happened was somebody through some probably very easy means Managed to steal everything from Gawker the source code to their blog software, which I'm pretty sure is just regular old blog software That's slightly modified.

151
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:01,556
Rym: I highly doubt they have anything particularly special.

152
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:05,940
Scott: It's just probably a CMS Just like you know, it's a WordPress kind of thing or movable type or one of those.

153
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,064
Scott: I don't even know which one they use.

154
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:14,952
Scott: and then they stole their entire database for all their blogs Including all the use names and passwords for posting comments and such.

155
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:16,980
Rym: but but of course they were encrypted.

156
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:17,970
Scott: Yeah, they were.

157
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:20,772
Scott: they were indeed But they made a very big mistake.

158
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:21,960
Scott: and this is is that you know?

159
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:44,840
Scott: I mean you can get all the details of this story elsewhere on the internet but the one thing I really want to focus is on is the storing of the passwords in the database right because Most of the stories you're gonna read on the internet won't discuss this very technical topic in any depth to where you'll actually understand what's going on, but It's a very important topic and all the other parts of this story are discussed everywhere in great depth.

160
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,547
Scott: So anyway, here's the way it works, right?

161
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:47,912
Scott: I have a website.

162
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:49,639
Scott: I want you to log into the website.

163
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:51,130
Scott: It means you need to.

164
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:58,692
Scott: every time you go to the website You type in a username and a password and you push submit and when you register at the website You also type in the password right to.

165
00:09:58,994 --> 00:09:59,919
Scott: you know to tell me what it is.

166
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:08,060
Scott: Now I just write down the password in the database But that means anyone who gets the database can see everyone's password and then log in as anyone.

167
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,680
Rym: I have worked at places where I had to change my password into system and it was old and no one could tell me how.

168
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:20,140
Rym: So breaking into the system and looking at the database I could see everyone's passwords and just do an update statement to set a new password for myself.

169
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:32,420
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you have access to the actual database server You can edit any of the passwords easily but to read the password is a different story Especially since many morons in the world use the same password on every website.

170
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:39,186
Scott: So if you get their seemingly innocuous blog comment posting password You could probably get into their bank account.

171
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:40,451
Rym: Yep, cuz oh.

172
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:42,900
Rym: and then once you get email email is like the gateway to everything.

173
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,011
Rym: It's like the chart at our wag of who is slept with who.

174
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:48,700
Rym: yeah, you can get to someone's email You can get to every other thing they've got.

175
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,160
Scott: Yeah And this is the thing is that most people use the same password everywhere.

176
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:56,380
Scott: Right, and when most you hear stories about like oh he hacked to myspace he hacked Facebook.

177
00:10:56,521 --> 00:11:01,847
Scott: usually it's just they had a really shitty password and someone guessed it or Saw it or figured it out.

178
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,740
Rym: cuz passwords and databases are hashed or munched or something, right?

179
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,386
Scott: So the way right?

180
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:06,780
Scott: so here's the part I want to talk about.

181
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,328
Scott: So we need to fix this.

182
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,097
Scott: You can't just have a password in the database.

183
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:10,600
Scott: It doesn't work.

184
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,740
Scott: So what the solution is is we encrypt the password, but how can we if we encrypt the password?

185
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,488
Scott: Then we could just decrypt it.

186
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:22,600
Scott: right if I use a code of like, okay We're gonna take every letter in the password and make it go up by one.

187
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,697
Scott: So if your password is a BBB will change it to B C C C and then right.

188
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:34,200
Scott: that doesn't work either Cuz as soon as someone knows the code they can reverse the code, but thankfully in maths, there are one-way transformations, right?

189
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,599
Scott: So we have hashes that are one way, you know, you just probably heard of things like MD 5 or sha1 or des.

190
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:42,251
Scott: Right, so you encrypt something.

191
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:44,060
Scott: basically, it's a one-way math.

192
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:48,480
Scott: So if it's one way though, how can we get it back and figure out if it's the right password?

193
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,518
Scott: Well, here's what you do, right?

194
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,920
Scott: Let's say your password is the letter a and I pipe it through MD 5 and outcomes blaga blaga blaga, right?

195
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,060
Scott: So I write blaga blaga blaga in the database.

196
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:05,480
Scott: so now you come to the website again and you type in a. I Type I take that a and I run it through the same.

197
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,376
Scott: You know gristmill and outcomes blaga blaga blaga and I can check to see if the blaga blagas match.

198
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:22,212
Scott: and if they match Then I know that you just typed in the right password even though I Don't I didn't know what the right password was because the right password was not in the database and also Because of maths that I'm not going to explain.

199
00:12:22,694 --> 00:12:24,000
Scott: you can't take the blaga blaga.

200
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:31,200
Rym: I want to tell the listeners because this applies to me as well Anytime we say math that we don't want to explain that is code for math that we don't particularly know.

201
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:35,000
Scott: I know it By heart, you can't go backwards, right?

202
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,360
Scott: So if I just say here Rym his blaga blaga tell me what the password is Rym will have no fucking clue.

203
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,628
Scott: There's no way for him to know now.

204
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:42,580
Rym: What I could do is brute-force it.

205
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:51,993
Scott: yes, and this is actually something that is many many people have done because actually it takes less than a fraction of a second to Doing it to do an MD 5 of anything

206
00:12:53,020 --> 00:13:03,120
Rym: which as an aside is why one of the most important things for security is on your outward facing portals to Slow down to throttle the rate of login attempts as people continue to fail.

207
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,726
Rym: Yep That is one of the surest ways.

208
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:17,080
Scott: or to lock out accounts after a certain number of false attempts Which means so many work blackberries get locked out because yeah stupid They stay but anyway or to have some physical thing like a Yuba key or RSA secure ID.

209
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,904
Rym: So I went to log on to server fault the other day to ask a question about DRBD and it was like What's your Yuba key?

210
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:25,111
Rym: And I was like, oh fuck I own a Yuba key.

211
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:27,500
Scott: Yeah, where is he on the keychain?

212
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:29,974
Rym: I found it and I plugged it in and it worked.

213
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:30,598
Scott: Yeah.

214
00:13:30,618 --> 00:13:34,169
Scott: There you go It only works 32,000 times that I had to give you a new one running out.

215
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:35,614
Scott: I know right?

216
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:36,336
Scott: It's very slowly.

217
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:43,320
Rym: Um, but anyway So I've used my Yuba key more times to show other people how it works than I've used it to actually log into anything.

218
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,842
Scott: That's fine.

219
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:44,124
Scott: I'm gonna.

220
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:44,425
Scott: I can.

221
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,740
Scott: I can incorporate into anything we've got, you know, we should do it on the website.

222
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,702
Rym: I think I could do that.

223
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:51,830
Scott: Um, anyway, I have it on one of my WordPress blogs the.

224
00:13:52,391 --> 00:14:00,640
Scott: so we MD 5 is not the greatest idea because Somebody out there and many people have done this is they just get the MD 5 of everything they are.

225
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,390
Scott: What's the MD 5 of a and they write it down?

226
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,040
Scott: What's the MD 5 of B and they write it down?

227
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,380
Scott: What's the MD 5 of C and they write it?

228
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,536
Scott: Yeah.

229
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:14,520
Rym: So if I look in your database and I find herp to derp de bar in the password hash And I know that herp to derp de bar is what happens when I put welcome into the text prompt.

230
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:20,576
Scott: Yeah Basically people have these thing called rainbow tables and they just is basically they've written down.

231
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:26,560
Scott: you can just download these things Every or the vast majority of the most common passwords.

232
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:29,168
Scott: You know MD 5 hashed so you can.

233
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:33,420
Scott: just they can just if they have the MD 5 hash even though it's not reversible math.

234
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:37,740
Scott: They've done the one-way math for almost every possible password.

235
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:40,780
Scott: So they just look up what your password is and this big ol list.

236
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:50,760
Rym: It's kind of like when you do complex integrations where sometimes there is no or like complex factoring where there is no procedure That is guaranteed to work that a human can follow.

237
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,710
Rym: I mean computers can follow, you know PNP.

238
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,700
Rym: they can follow algorithms that will eventually guaranteed find an answer.

239
00:14:57,222 --> 00:15:05,040
Rym: But humans don't have that luxury and a lot of times the way to solve an integral is to look up how to solve it Because someone else already figured out the optimal path.

240
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:09,058
Scott: Now there are some things that you can do to help this.

241
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,931
Scott: for example Some people use salts and what a salt is is okay.

242
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:32,940
Scott: instead of just running your password upon its own Through the one-way math We're gonna take your password and also your username and the date that you joined This website and put them all together and then run that through the one-way math and that helps quite a bit right because now Someone, you know can't just sit there getting pat guessing passwords.

243
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:40,820
Scott: They also have to guess You know The the time you joined and they have to know that that's what the salt is in order to actually get the password.

244
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:42,679
Scott: It becomes a little bit more difficult.

245
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:47,837
Rym: Or they have to pull some sort of taiko brahi math where they figure it out indirectly, which is not likely.

246
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:48,840
Rym: that is solving.

247
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:56,780
Scott: I mean the thing is in this case It wouldn't have helped because they have access to the database and the source code of the block of the Gawker website.

248
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,637
Scott: So they know what the salt is because they can see the salt right in the source code of the website.

249
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,383
Rym: Oh Snap.

250
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:07,174
Scott: so with that knowledge and with you know, the thing is Gawker wasn't even using assault.

251
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,119
Scott: They were just using straight-up des, right?

252
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:14,720
Scott: Oh So you can see the source code and they have the hash password so they can figure out everything.

253
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,889
Scott: You know They just have to go and they they just had to get their tables.

254
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,860
Scott: and they can because des is pretty fast to calculate.

255
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:21,163
Scott: They can.

256
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:22,980
Scott: just they don't have a table already.

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,653
Scott: They just generate a new table and it's gonna take them a few days.

258
00:16:25,673 --> 00:16:27,441
Rym: They try to cover it up, but it's too late Right.

259
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:28,325
Rym: I've seen everything.

260
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:30,414
Scott: So what is the solution to this problem?

261
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:31,840
Scott: Well, you might be thinking well.

262
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:34,770
Scott: Rym and Scott are always talking about public key private key.

263
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:36,315
Scott: Isn't that the right solution?

264
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:37,900
Scott: No, that actually doesn't work at all.

265
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:40,087
Scott: Yeah, what are you gonna do?

266
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:44,100
Scott: Okay, so I'll encrypt my password with my private key and send it to you.

267
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,983
Scott: Okay.

268
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:46,847
Scott: Yeah that fails.

269
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:53,620
Scott: Okay, so I'll encrypt my password with your Public key and send it and it there's no way to do it.

270
00:16:53,981 --> 00:16:59,980
Rym: You use a public private key system of X key exchange that lets you log into the site, but then isn't you?

271
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,979
Scott: Well, that's s is okay.

272
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,904
Scott: So I like this.

273
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:05,760
Scott: the login to the site is SSL so nobody can just sniff my password off the network.

274
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:16,207
Scott: But you still have to store something in your database that you can Decrypt to verify that the password that I have sent to you is the correct pass kind of like a lot of people carry their private Keys around on a USB stick.

275
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,640
Rym: that's well and good unless someone has access to USB stick.

276
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,131
Scott: Yeah, you could do an SSH model.

277
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:34,220
Scott: We're basically instead of giving you a password I give you my public key and you store that in your database and then I log into the website with a challenge response By by because I have my private key on my computer.

278
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,190
Scott: That's far too difficult.

279
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:37,300
Scott: No one will ever be able to do that.

280
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,409
Rym: You do that for things like government secrets.

281
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,899
Scott: that Oh WikiLeaks or as you know, your servers with SSH.

282
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:49,439
Scott: Yeah, all right That's not gonna work for logging into websites just like Yubikey and RSA secure ID aren't really gonna work for logging into websites.

283
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:58,540
Scott: people Can barely handle, you know Wow and PayPal using physical login mechanisms, you know They're not gonna be able to handle it for every single website in the world.

284
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,960
Scott: So the correct solution at least as of right now is actually a thing called bcrypt.

285
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,725
Scott: Bcrypt isn't really mathematically much different than using you know hashes on assault You know with a one-way math.

286
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:19,500
Scott: the one thing that bcrypt actually has an advantage of though However, is that it's actually kind of slow, right?

287
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:31,980
Scott: You can still generate a rainbow table for bcrypt But it'll take you a fucking long as time and you might be saying well So as soon as we wait a couple years bcrypt will be dead because I'll just use a faster computer and that'll be that.

288
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:33,919
Scott: Right, I can figure out all the bcrypts.

289
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,795
Scott: well bcrypt actually has options where you can tell it how long you want it to take.

290
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:43,425
Scott: so it can actually as Computers get faster.

291
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:53,800
Scott: You can just keep changing the number that you're telling bcrypt Right to go slower and slow until basically you can always make it so that it takes like five minutes.

292
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,545
Scott: Did you know to jet?

293
00:18:55,625 --> 00:19:00,560
Scott: even if you make it take two seconds to generate you the password with bcrypt, right?

294
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:05,020
Scott: And you keep changing it as computers get faster so that it always takes two seconds.

295
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:09,416
Scott: That's still two seconds times the number of passwords.

296
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:10,199
Scott: It's gonna take them.

297
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,727
Scott: Centuries do remember.

298
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:14,740
Rym: it's not a number of passwords until they get yours.

299
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,687
Rym: That's just even to generate the tables.

300
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:17,992
Rym: Like if you're gonna brute-force it.

301
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:18,674
Scott: Yeah, they had.

302
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:20,200
Scott: you know, remember this is one-way math.

303
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,400
Scott: They can't just take it and you know, look up and go backwards from the from the encrypted stuff to get the password.

304
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,866
Scott: They actually have to try every password in the universe until they find a match for You know the what you've got.

305
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:35,140
Rym: think of it as like a CAPTCHA system for computers.

306
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:43,433
Rym: We've got a human who wants to connect and say you give them increasingly difficult to solve Mathematical CAPTCHAs as they continue to fail to log on.

307
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:44,237
Rym: so there's some.

308
00:19:44,297 --> 00:19:50,980
Rym: it takes more Actual real entropy universe destroying efforts to get in to make one more attempt.

309
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:55,540
Scott: Yep, so if you're worried about your database being taken from your website, right?

310
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,040
Scott: And you actually have you know.

311
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,097
Scott: If you're just using software that someone else wrote like WordPress or something just let it be don't you know?

312
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:03,060
Scott: worry too much about it.

313
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,106
Scott: Just keep it up to date with the security, you know 2650 users in their database.

314
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:10,534
Rym: We're using the password either password or QWERTY.

315
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:11,959
Scott: Yeah, I mean our.

316
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:14,460
Scott: You know my WordPress blogs.

317
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,942
Scott: I added Yubikey to them because I know WordPress is all frequently has security holes and I'm always updating it to make sure but I Haven't really changed.

318
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:27,542
Scott: It still uses whatever WordPress uses for encrypting passwords, you know, but if I make my own site Right.

319
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:31,320
Scott: I'm doing the bcrypt and the salt and the hole, right?

320
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:31,720
Scott: You got it.

321
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,289
Scott: I'm going full-on to make sure that that shit is working.

322
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,818
Rym: and also maybe Yubikey as an aside salt does it like.

323
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:57,440
Rym: this is just One very specific application of salt like I don't know if Firefox still does it but back in the day Mozilla to your profile directories would be you know Your username and then a dot and then a bunch of random characters so that worms and things that might try to exploit profiles Couldn't easily figure out what your profile was based on when you logged in or anything.

324
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:03,766
Scott: They could just go into the profile folder and see that there's only one folder in there And that would be the only folder in there.

325
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:04,428
Rym: Yeah, it was you.

326
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,893
Rym: I mean it was this.

327
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:11,740
Rym: this is a primitive mechanism from Yeah, anyway.

328
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:12,785
Scott: But you see this is.

329
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:19,800
Scott: this is what how you have to store passwords in Databases to let people log in without giving all the passwords away, right?

330
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:26,811
Scott: And this is why you should never you know when steam or any of those other people tell you Don't tell anyone your password.

331
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:29,483
Scott: even the company that you are You know working with.

332
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:34,340
Scott: don't even tell your password to your bank because the bank doesn't know the password.

333
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:37,100
Scott: They've just got a database full of gobbledygook, right?

334
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:48,309
Scott: So there's no reason to ever tell anyone in the universe your password ever because they don't need to know it in their database, right and You no one else needs to know it.

335
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,815
Scott: only you need to know it.

336
00:21:50,237 --> 00:21:53,458
Scott: so don't tell anyone Because of this stuff that we are saying right now.

337
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:56,620
Rym: So I'll talk about this briefly because we went on for a while about the other thing.

338
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,860
Rym: I want to make sure people understood this very important personal security information, but it looks like good things are on the horizon.

339
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:07,420
Rym: There's an article on slash out talking about this, but we might slowly see the end of VGA.

340
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,126
Scott: VGA cables.

341
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:09,812
Scott: Yeah, they're not.

342
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:10,880
Scott: I mean they're already dead.

343
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:17,040
Rym: Pretty much every projector in the business and convention world has just a VGA input.

344
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:22,020
Scott: Well, no, no I mean most of the projectors that I've seen in recent history have all kinds of inputs.

345
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:26,105
Scott: The thing is people always use VGA Because the least common denominator.

346
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:31,400
Scott: and even if someone has DVI or HDMI or DisplayPort output it can always be converted to VGA.

347
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:44,179
Scott: So rather than provide a litany of different cables for different occasions and different laptops They always just give you a VGA and then Completely fail at every convention because they forget to bring their adapters if they even have it.

348
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:46,432
Scott: Yeah, but I mean you can just go and get.

349
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:47,840
Scott: they have the adapters they exist.

350
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:53,639
Scott: So it's it's just the fact that it's the least common denominator, you know, that's the only reason it's still around on the projectors.

351
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:55,505
Scott: It doesn't really need to be.

352
00:22:55,525 --> 00:23:05,506
Scott: I mean we could probably provide DVI and start giving to the finger to the few people who have Only VGA is their option, but the problem is at the same time laptop I mean my laptops VGA only.

353
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:09,560
Scott: really mine has a. mine has a VGA output, but it also has some other option.

354
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:10,719
Rym: What other option does it have?

355
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,463
Scott: Let me take a look.

356
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,880
Rym: I mean, it might have a DisplayPort which is starting to be more common.

357
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:19,305
Scott: No, I guess doesn't have any.

358
00:23:19,446 --> 00:23:20,850
Scott: I thought I had another option now.

359
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,603
Rym: so uh, we got the V to DVI only projector Not what.

360
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:25,469
Scott: oh, no, I sorry.

361
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:27,220
Scott: It does have a different option, but I need the docking.

362
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:28,646
Scott: I need the docking station.

363
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,875
Rym: You're gonna bring your docking station to do a presentation.

364
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:32,119
Scott: I don't have a docking station.

365
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:45,250
Scott: But you know, I've seen plenty of laptops, you know, most of them nowadays the newer ones have DisplayPort or HDMI or Not as many as you think Many of you guys around.

366
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:58,260
Rym: but VGA is still pretty much the standard on projectors mostly I think I think the biggest reason why we haven't been able to just kind of chuck it as quickly as we have other things Is that VGI day is such a long history and a lot of people are really cheap

367
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,390
Scott: You know, the other thing

368
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,439
Rym: is that they're not replacing.

369
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:01,647
Scott: The other thing is right.

370
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:03,920
Scott: take for example, my TV was stolen, right?

371
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,298
Scott: they also stole my HDMI cable said to buy some new ones.

372
00:24:06,318 --> 00:24:11,040
Scott: and But so I when I got I got a new TV before I was able to get new HDMI cable.

373
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,980
Scott: So for a day or two, I plugged in my HD PC to my new TV with a VGA cable.

374
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:16,923
Scott: You know what?

375
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:21,417
Scott: It was that you know, 1080p full HD on a VGA cable.

376
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:23,082
Scott: just fine It was.

377
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:38,780
Scott: I really couldn't tell the difference between the HDMI cable and the VGA cable Other than the fact that the video driver was a little flaky that using different, you know I had to set it differently Yeah, and I had to push like the auto sync button and also it didn't doesn't an audio over the VGA cable.

378
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,200
Scott: But other than that the actual video quality after I you know, got it aligned was identical.

379
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,465
Rym: Yeah, but they're the one.

380
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:49,138
Rym: it's a little because I was playing around plugging my computer and different things in with.

381
00:24:49,158 --> 00:24:52,069
Rym: you know HDMI versus the VGA and the VGA.

382
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:53,073
Rym: for summary.

383
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:53,836
Rym: It's a little fuzzy.

384
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:56,325
Rym: I didn't know There's an over scan.

385
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:57,329
Scott: I mean it's LCD.

386
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:57,911
Scott: you can't really.

387
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:02,311
Scott: I got I had under scan with the with HDMI But then I fixed it cuz the ATI driver sucked.

388
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:03,235
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

389
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:04,100
Scott: ATI driver you suck.

390
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:11,975
Rym: But basically Intel is taking the first step and by 2015 They're gonna stop supporting VGA and all of their client processors and chipsets.

391
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:12,818
Scott: No good idea.

392
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,369
Scott: Yeah I mean this is it doesn't matter though, cuz okay.

393
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,594
Scott: We'll stop supporting VGA.

394
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:19,583
Scott: So everyone have DVI With adapters.

395
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,493
Scott: Yeah, you know what really needs to happen.

396
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:24,922
Scott: is we just need to be like, you know You need to.

397
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:28,800
Scott: when you go to a place right you do the slow transition.

398
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,971
Scott: You know instead of just having a VGA cable be the only thing.

399
00:25:32,312 --> 00:25:36,931
Scott: when you hook up a projector at a conference or in a Conference room have a DVI cable there.

400
00:25:37,091 --> 00:25:39,000
Scott: also have an HDMI cable there.

401
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:42,280
Scott: Also have these other cables next to the VGA cable.

402
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:56,389
Rym: So that is why I wanted to bring this article up because if you look at the trend of computing in technology history Very rarely has the non backward compatible kind of long change thing Been the one that failed when there's a race.

403
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:00,578
Rym: and in this case, I mean look at most projectors now I said they'll have VGA.

404
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:01,704
Rym: Usually.

405
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:03,597
Rym: they also have as video and RCA.

406
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,760
Scott: Yeah, it's because they you know, they're not expecting computers.

407
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:10,534
Scott: Most of them are not meant for computers primarily even though that's what they use for primarily.

408
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:14,028
Rym: but all the old Computers like old laptops I had at work.

409
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,579
Rym: They'll have as video out some of them.

410
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:28,271
Rym: Yeah So basically what's gonna happen is it's kind of like we've got this queue and now we're dropping RCA and s video off the end and VGA is gonna be the old ass connector on everything.

411
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:32,579
Rym: but new things coming out are slowly probably going to have Like DisplayPort and VGA.

412
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:39,160
Scott: I think really what we need to have is you need to have HDMI because right the HDMI also has audio.

413
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:52,705
Scott: So as soon as people can realize that and it actually starts to work If you hook up your laptop with HDMI and the audio also works Right and the video on the projector without having to have the separate tiny little wire I agree.

414
00:26:52,766 --> 00:27:07,014
Rym: However, it is annoying to me personally Only because when I you know running conventions and doing things like that if I'm in charge of a room I often want to do very weird and specific splits to different devices.

415
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:10,525
Scott: I'm not saying remove the headphone hole Right, it's just.

416
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:10,766
Scott: I know.

417
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:11,329
Scott: I agree with you.

418
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:19,679
Rym: in the vast majority of cases in the modern world There's no reason to have these separate audio and video chains because very rarely do you want one and not the.

419
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:27,204
Scott: you know Plus if it's a fancy room right that HDMI cable is not gonna go directly into the projector sending its audio into the projector Which is really dumb.

420
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:32,880
Scott: It's gonna send it into some sort of room mixing machine, you know And then it's gonna forward the video to the projector.

421
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,191
Scott: We were spoiled forward the audio to the speaker system by RIT.

422
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:40,628
Rym: to this day when I give a presentation somewhere Nobody has a setup like RIT did.

423
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,532
Scott: No, not at all.

424
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:52,088
Scott: every room the wall jacks the podiums Yeah more laptops should have HDMI or mini HDMI and it should come with the appropriate adapters to go to VGA because it's still necessary.

425
00:27:52,108 --> 00:28:10,587
Scott: and then when people if you set up projectors and conference rooms make sure to provide multiple different ways to connect so that people will use you know, the one that is the best and they won't you know I mean if people have see that the HDMI cable fits they're gonna choose that over the VGA Which requires screwing in and it's all kind of funky.

426
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:15,061
Rym: I actually have a non screwing VGA cable has little clips that go like a kunk Interesting.

427
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:24,570
Rym: Yeah, so anyway things of the day.

428
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:26,517
Scott: So check it out.

429
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:34,094
Scott: It's say it's hockey season So it's about time to do some hockey things today As we want to.

430
00:28:34,174 --> 00:28:37,650
Rym: as I recall we have had multiple hockey fight weeks in the past.

431
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:39,108
Scott: I think we only had one hockey fight week.

432
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:42,860
Scott: This is a pretty good stick right this guy.

433
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,386
Scott: I'm not even sure what league this is.

434
00:28:44,426 --> 00:28:47,075
Scott: It's some minor league Not too many spectators league.

435
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:47,837
Rym: All

436
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:59,522
Scott: right, but this dude he picks up the puck on his stick something pretty much any hockey player can do When he's behind the net and he pretty much plunks it onto the goalie's head and then it bounces off the back of the goal He said into the goal.

437
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:00,070
Scott: brilliant.

438
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:04,561
Scott: This would not work in You know more professional leagues because someone would have hit him.

439
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:09,280
Scott: if you notice there was a guy standing right there Basically watching him do it in the NHL.

440
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,790
Scott: The guy would have just hit his stick and taken the fuck, right?

441
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:15,906
Scott: It's only works because it's amateur hour, but it's still pretty awesome, right?

442
00:29:15,926 --> 00:29:24,133
Rym: It's one of those moves You're like, oh snap kind of like the the little league football trick plays exactly or the kids stealing home plate Exactly.

443
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:25,340
Scott: I love that love this.

444
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,090
Rym: So I don't have a video or anything.

445
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:34,650
Rym: I'm gonna try to not use College Humor, you know cop-outs for a while, but I Would I wanted to use this on a Tuesday, but I haven't used College Humor in forever.

446
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,876
Scott: This is the first time in a long time,

447
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:51,349
Rym: but basically this is an opinion piece on the New York Times You know, whatever by David Brooks, but it's called the triumph of hope over self-interest And it's an interesting article that if you boil it down is basically Why do poor people vote to give rich people more money?

448
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:55,350
Rym: And the statistic is really interesting.

449
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,496
Rym: I actually want to use this.

450
00:29:56,557 --> 00:30:03,450
Scott: the next time we do a game theory panel this statistic Are there studies to back up whatever hypothesis this this this guy is presenting here?

451
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,250
Rym: Oh, there's one study and then a couple of other kind of tentatively linked to study.

452
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:11,090
Scott: We could actually probably study this psychological phenomena with some sort.

453
00:30:11,151 --> 00:30:12,330
Rym: Yeah Well, he makes sort of game.

454
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:24,889
Rym: He makes some interesting points that if you notice and this is all just conjecture the people who tend to vote against tax increases For the wealthy even though they're poor tend to live in less affluent areas where they feel like they're richer.

455
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:30,311
Rym: They feel like they have more money when actually they're you know in the bottom 50% Mm-hmm.

456
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:37,922
Rym: So the interesting statistic is that and this was from 2000 and apparently it's worse now I'm trying to find the more recent study.

457
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,030
Rym: It's behind a paywall.

458
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:49,920
Rym: They ask people one if they believe that they are in the top 1% of wage earners 19% of Americans think they are the richest 1%.

459
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,384
Scott: Oh boy.

460
00:30:51,885 --> 00:30:53,770
Rym: I thought it'd be like 5% 6%.

461
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,395
Rym: no 19% of Americans.

462
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:58,638
Scott: I know the top 1% of America has like 25% of the wealth.

463
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:09,758
Rym: So so so so a further 20% expect Realistically that in their lifetime.

464
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,652
Rym: They will be in the top 1%.

465
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:16,079
Scott: Already know you're not you're not in the 1%.

466
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:27,030
Rym: the odds of you being in the 1% are 1% less than 1% 39% of people think they're rich and as a result think that the rich shouldn't be taxed when in actuality They are some of the poorest.

467
00:31:27,672 --> 00:31:31,885
Scott: Uh-huh, and it's it's an interesting article that so that's that's the actual.

468
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:33,450
Scott: there was actual study behind those numbers.

469
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,521
Rym: Yeah, those numbers are a sir a post-election survey in 2000.

470
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:36,862
Rym: Okay.

471
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:39,170
Rym: Well, I'd love to see today's day.

472
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,262
Scott: I would love to see today's date is of course the economy got bad.

473
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:44,250
Rym: So maybe people be like I'm not rich anymore.

474
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:48,690
Rym: Yeah, I'd say my house went under so I'm gonna try to find some more data, but it's an interest.

475
00:31:48,770 --> 00:32:00,610
Scott: Yeah, I would be very surprised if there's any homeless people who are not also crazy people who said I'm in the richest one You don't even have a house dude, I mean, ah, but he doesn't have a phone so he's not gonna get pulled.

476
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:06,842
Rym: But this is an example, you know Monday people can talk about this a lot of game theory.

477
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,814
Rym: game theory perfectly models the behavior of Rational actors.

478
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:11,980
Scott: That's what I was just gonna say.

479
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,670
Scott: We need to study this with a game.

480
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:22,128
Scott: Yes, we need to have a game where you know, we make people think There's taxes and you have to vote on the taxes.

481
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:26,445
Scott: Straight up you vote on the taxes for the next turn.

482
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:30,499
Scott: Yeah But you you get tax this turn.

483
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,206
Rym: I notice you're not voting for the tax increase.

484
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:34,370
Rym: anything you tear to share.

485
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:39,432
Scott: I'm in the top like 20%.

486
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:40,295
Rym: It's an interesting article.

487
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:42,886
Rym: I thought I'd do something more erudite than a guy getting hit in the nuts.

488
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:46,416
Scott: All right Meta moments meta moment.

489
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:52,514
Rym: We're going to be at MAGFest doing free panels not Simultaneously, that's good.

490
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:53,718
Rym: What is our panel?

491
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:57,590
Rym: And then we're also going to sit on two of the mag nine gaming intellectual panels.

492
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,280
Rym: I think it's technical changes in game design and Achievements in metagaming.

493
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:03,389
Scott: Yeah, I wonder how those are gonna go.

494
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:04,614
Rym: I think they'll be interesting.

495
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:11,863
Rym: the people everyone else on the mag nine seems intelligent about games and We were encouraged to disagree.

496
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:13,150
Rym: I don't know if you read that email.

497
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,533
Rym: They're like.

498
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:21,935
Rym: I would hope that you will Disagree with each other forthwith in order to make the panels interesting and not just yes, man Uh-huh.

499
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,830
Rym: I plan to disagree with people.

500
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,247
Scott: Yeah, that's gonna go.

501
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:36,210
Rym: well The book club book is hyperspace Michio Kaku's hyperspace a snap The last book club book was World War Z. You can listen to our show from last week.

502
00:33:36,732 --> 00:33:38,279
Rym: We also have a book club book site.

503
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:39,243
Rym: I don't think we put it up yet.

504
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:40,227
Scott: No, I got.

505
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:40,890
Scott: I gotta work on that.

506
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:41,735
Rym: Okay, it's almost done.

507
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:42,681
Rym: I did all the data entry.

508
00:33:42,842 --> 00:33:43,889
Scott: All right, do we add World War Z?

509
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:45,735
Rym: No, that's your book.

510
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,524
Rym: Okay, gotta add your own books from now on.

511
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:48,510
Scott: All right, I'll add it.

512
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:50,316
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX East.

513
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,390
Rym: we're gonna be at you know, anime Boston all those other conventions and icon.

514
00:33:55,971 --> 00:34:00,790
Rym: We're not gonna be a Katsucon which only comes up because someone emailed us asking about Katsucon panels.

515
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,748
Rym: We quit that staff like a year and a half many years ago years ago.

516
00:34:06,036 --> 00:34:07,330
Scott: You can buy t-shirts.

517
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:12,570
Rym: You know GeekNights t-shirts the original series are actually selling out pretty quick.

518
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,635
Rym: We have very few left.

519
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:16,768
Scott: and then you know, you got to buy them all before you get more.

520
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:22,065
Scott: So Oh and as we have a counter-strike server, yes, yes dot front row crew calm.

521
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:23,110
Scott: Did you test if that works?

522
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,393
Rym: Uh, yes, it does.

523
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:27,364
Rym: Okay, also GeekNights dot dine DNS calm.

524
00:34:27,444 --> 00:34:30,196
Rym: also the IP address in the forums It's currently.

525
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:33,170
Rym: it might go down tonight because I got to put the computer I built back together.

526
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:35,460
Rym: Yeah, but we're gonna start hosting.

527
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:37,270
Rym: this is kind of a test and it seems to be going well.

528
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:46,500
Rym: I'm gonna try to host a lot more game and file and servers for you people because I got crazy files and Someone in the forum is running a minecraft server.

529
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,629
Scott: It's actually this they're Devon a second go of it.

530
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:51,080
Rym: Yes There's prior Toria, which they built.

531
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,264
Scott: Well, no, I think they have another one.

532
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:53,289
Rym: Yeah now it's second this.

533
00:34:53,670 --> 00:35:02,244
Scott: Okay, so, you know if you want to play Minecraft with people join the guides forum join the forum And I guess you know, I guess if you fuck around they'll ban you.

534
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:03,047
Scott: we have nothing to do with that.

535
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,092
Scott: It's unofficial It's not.

536
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:05,296
Scott: it's not officially endorsed.

537
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,904
Rym: It is unofficial, but it is endorsed as in.

538
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:08,727
Rym: I endorse it.

539
00:35:08,868 --> 00:35:10,849
Scott: All right Well, they have one.

540
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:16,350
Rym: I guess the gist of this is that we have a lot of listeners who you know Kind of shy away from all the community around GeekNights.

541
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:28,050
Scott: But really I think the community around the front row crew and GeekNights I mean if you're stronger than GeekNights itself if you listen to this show Every day, I mean sir, you don't want to connect with the other people who do the same thing.

542
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,095
Scott: I mean the people.

543
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:32,250
Scott: there's only very few people out of the seven billion people on earth.

544
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,850
Scott: There's a ridiculously small percentage of people who listen to this show with any frequency.

545
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:49,440
Scott: So if you're doing that and there are other people who are doing that Those are probably people who are on earth have a great more in common with you than any other people's on earth And you probably would you know want to connect with those people.

546
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:49,601
Scott: it

547
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:53,949
Rym: is telling that many people who don't listen to podcasts anymore I mean, I don't really listen to podcasts

548
00:35:54,872 --> 00:35:55,214
Scott: They

549
00:35:55,235 --> 00:36:01,490
Rym: you know, they go to our panels at cons and everything But they hang out in the forums to this day because the forum community is kind of an independent body.

550
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:04,404
Rym: Yeah, and it's not scary like the penny arcade forums.

551
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:05,088
Rym: It's legit.

552
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:09,612
Scott: Yep All right, so Abstraction.

553
00:36:09,874 --> 00:36:12,146
Scott: Yeah, we sort of came up with this idea.

554
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:12,830
Scott: Who knows how to go.

555
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,396
Rym: I didn't want to talk about home networking.

556
00:36:14,678 --> 00:36:15,601
Scott: No, we already did that.

557
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:17,690
Rym: We talked about our own home network.

558
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,373
Scott: That's the same thing.

559
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,016
Rym: I don't know.

560
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:21,085
Rym: Would you guys want to hear about port forwarding?

561
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:24,254
Rym: Okay, whatever Listeners back me up.

562
00:36:24,857 --> 00:36:26,805
Scott: Yeah, they want to hear about anything that they'll.

563
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,090
Scott: they'll take any show they can get.

564
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:28,572
Rym: No, they won't.

565
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:30,320
Rym: they want a zombie show and a food show.

566
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,390
Rym: Yeah and a port forwarding home networking show.

567
00:36:32,932 --> 00:36:36,930
Scott: Anyway, I wanted to talk about abstraction because it relates to the networking situation.

568
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:44,093
Scott: It's also widely misunderstood and it's also pretty much what you know, the core concept of pretty much modern Computing.

569
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:57,348
Scott: for anything, you know beyond a user level right anything deeper than a user level You have to understand what abstraction is and you have to be able to recognize layers of abstraction and the connections between them and You know what abstraction means.

570
00:36:58,431 --> 00:37:04,070
Scott: Right, and we also use this term a lot when talking about board games and RPGs where it means the exact same thing.

571
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,119
Rym: It always amazes me in my professional career.

572
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:08,730
Rym: I run into people who ostensibly went to computer school.

573
00:37:09,372 --> 00:37:26,219
Rym: They've done learn the computers and it's not that they don't know some particular thing like how to do abstractions or instances or interfaces or whatever in a particular language or the OSI model but they just never like learn coding enough to know the fundamentals of How to write code or how to.

574
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:30,885
Rym: I've got a fit like I. they don't understand abstraction Which is like the core of modern coding, right?

575
00:37:30,926 --> 00:37:34,390
Scott: So it To give you an idea of what abstraction is, right?

576
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,430
Scott: Let's talk about, you know, the OSI model of networking which is something you should learn also.

577
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,630
Scott: So it's we're gonna give you two birds for one stone.

578
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:44,950
Rym: If you learn Cisco, you probably think there are five but technically there are seven layers.

579
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:53,887
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is the top layer is the application layer and the thing nowadays The application layer can have multiple application layers and often does so.

580
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:54,690
Scott: shit gets crazy.

581
00:37:55,171 --> 00:38:00,327
Scott: But it's really only seven layers, you know in the classical you remember that I could.

582
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:01,833
Scott: I'm gonna look them up the internet Really?

583
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:09,404
Rym: I remember most of the physical data link network transport session Presentation application because presentations all the encryption and stuff.

584
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:09,786
Scott: Yep.

585
00:38:10,047 --> 00:38:10,510
Rym: Took me a while.

586
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:12,950
Rym: See the thing is the OSI model.

587
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,582
Rym: It's funny because it's an abstraction and it's very important.

588
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:22,755
Rym: and yet TCP IP Which is kind of based on the OCI OSI model is Not seven layers.

589
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:25,668
Rym: They actually only break down to five layers and most people only know that.

590
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,062
Scott: yep Anyway, but what an abstraction layer is?

591
00:38:29,102 --> 00:38:30,570
Scott: think of it like a cake, right?

592
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:34,769
Scott: You know, you have a layer cake or each layer rests upon the layer below it.

593
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:49,507
Scott: so each layer is a layer of abstraction and what it does is basically it allows you to Interact with a technology or a system right while hiding Everything that can be hidden and only you know fulfilling certain functions.

594
00:38:49,948 --> 00:38:52,522
Scott: for example Think about your car that you drive right.

595
00:38:52,783 --> 00:39:01,914
Scott: when you're driving this car You're stepping on a gas pedal and a brake and you're spinning a wheel the gas pedal abstracts a throttle mechanism That is surprisingly complex.

596
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:03,699
Scott: Yeah, so they're inside the car.

597
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,785
Scott: what happens when you step on the gas pedal?

598
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:07,913
Scott: is this ludicrously complex system Right.

599
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:09,040
Rym: Well, well, it depends.

600
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,659
Rym: in in older cars like my car There's a wire that just opens or closes a hole.

601
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,325
Rym: Yeah, pretty much but opens or closes more or less doesn't completely, you know.

602
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:28,109
Scott: in many cars nowadays They'll actually, you know stepping on the gas pedal will go to a computer which is calibrated to think Okay stepped on it this much.

603
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:35,007
Scott: So he wants to go this much faster and you know The automatic transmission might change gears and then when he said quickly you stepped on.

604
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:38,263
Rym: when you step off It'll keep going at full speed until it crashes and you sue somebody.

605
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:43,650
Scott: Yeah, you know, there's various Various, you know things that go on thrust from stepping on a pedal, right?

606
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:54,939
Scott: so this simple mechanism of pedal goes up pedal goes down is abstracting this complex system of Pistons spinning and going up and down.

607
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:59,330
Scott: and you know gas, you know moving around and air intakes opening up.

608
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,174
Rym: We have technical people.

609
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:01,722
Rym: I mean, let's talk about accessing web page.

610
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:06,270
Rym: I got Firefox open right now All right, so Firefox is displaying a web page.

611
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,758
Rym: I'm communicating with something.

612
00:40:07,778 --> 00:40:09,829
Rym: say I connect to Scott's server over at his house.

613
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:13,685
Rym: Firefox doesn't know anything about the voltages on the wire.

614
00:40:14,027 --> 00:40:14,629
Scott: That's for sure.

615
00:40:15,494 --> 00:40:18,568
Rym: It doesn't even know anything about MAC addresses or data lakes.

616
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:27,264
Rym: In fact there's stuff at both ends because you kind of have to go down through the layers of abstraction all the way to the bottom and Then all the way back up to the top again.

617
00:40:27,284 --> 00:40:30,133
Rym: So basically, you know We've got all these layers.

618
00:40:30,293 --> 00:40:42,110
Rym: if Firefox at the top is my application layer and I'm connecting to Apache on Scott's server Which is an application in and of itself The application only knows that it's talking to another application.

619
00:40:42,592 --> 00:40:43,476
Scott: Yeah, I mean when you're right.

620
00:40:43,496 --> 00:40:50,030
Scott: if you let's say I was gonna write my own web browser in C Let's say right C knows how to work a computer, right?

621
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:57,839
Scott: So in C, I would be doing things like moving bits around in memory and flipping Transistors and moving data between RAM and the CPU.

622
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,130
Scott: and you know writing and reading data from input output devices, right?

623
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:03,796
Rym: But I don't have to write.

624
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:07,570
Scott: set the voltage on this pin to six volts.

625
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:12,831
Scott: You never had to write that because that is something that is hidden from you on the layer that you are working on Right.

626
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:23,682
Scott: So in order to do networking on the internet as the most of the networking that you're gonna do in your life there are actually seven different layers of This kind of extraction going on right.

627
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:30,627
Rym: the bottom layer, of course being Electricities or electrons or that's the same thing or photons is what I meant to say.

628
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:31,290
Scott: Oh photons.

629
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:39,037
Scott: Yes It could be optical you're correct, you know, it's basically the electricity the lights the you know Whatever some sort of physical hardware.

630
00:41:39,098 --> 00:41:49,529
Scott: It could actually be like somebody's hand taking up You know a plastic tube and moving the plastic tube from one shoot to another shoot and then the tube goes flying away, right?

631
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,729
Scott: Whatever the physical thing is that makes the data move is the bottom layer.

632
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:57,666
Rym: So think a simple example to just have two computers.

633
00:41:57,686 --> 00:41:58,430
Rym: They're on a local network.

634
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,650
Rym: You just want to have them talk to each other directly.

635
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:05,490
Rym: So the computers at the lowest level that you know layer to the so-called data link layer.

636
00:42:05,972 --> 00:42:08,825
Rym: They know, you know, they have an abstraction of the physical layer.

637
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:16,037
Rym: They know something like Send data to this address on The network in quotes.

638
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,964
Rym: it knows there is the network.

639
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:21,601
Rym: I can send stuff to it Yep, and I can get stuff from it.

640
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:30,850
Rym: That's all it needs to know Yep, and then then you know every layer up only needs to know the layer underneath it Yep, so the network the layer three is like the network layer, right?

641
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:37,077
Scott: And that's where you start getting the switching and the routing going on, you know, if you just that's IP Yeah, a data link Mac addresses.

642
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:38,622
Rym: So, you know, I connect out.

643
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:41,050
Rym: so IP address I have and ports that's transport layer.

644
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:44,063
Rym: So I connect to port 80 that's the transport layer.

645
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,750
Rym: that says, you know, what am I connecting to?

646
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,898
Rym: How am I connecting TCP UDP all that stuff?

647
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,770
Rym: and then so where am I connecting the next layer down?

648
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,570
Rym: That's like your address the IP address and then once you get through the switches and routers.

649
00:42:54,931 --> 00:42:59,626
Rym: Your Mac address doesn't travel all the way through Mac addresses is just local computers next to each other talking.

650
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:04,783
Scott: Mm-hmm Actually, I don't think a lot of people understand how Mac addresses work.

651
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:08,189
Scott: we should we should like all right Let's say we can cover that very quickly.

652
00:43:09,752 --> 00:43:10,555
Rym: Well, what about it?

653
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:12,242
Rym: I mean, it's actually not a quick thing to cover.

654
00:43:12,282 --> 00:43:16,230
Scott: if you if they don't actually know how it works No, that's what I'm saying is it's it's pretty quick, right?

655
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,529
Scott: It's basically when you plug your computer in with a wire, right?

656
00:43:20,652 --> 00:43:23,310
Scott: On a LAN over the hub, that's not a good, okay.

657
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:26,081
Scott: Basically, what happens is if you want to send you want to send.

658
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:32,088
Scott: I want to send a packet from my computer to rims computer Right and there's ten computers on this network and they all just have wires going into a hub.

659
00:43:32,831 --> 00:43:36,225
Scott: So how does my packet get from my computer to rims computer the hub?

660
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:37,570
Scott: a hub doesn't know anything.

661
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:41,264
Scott: All a hub does is take every packet going in and send it out to everybody.

662
00:43:41,405 --> 00:43:42,750
Scott: All right, it doesn't it doesn't know shit.

663
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:44,977
Scott: So everybody sees the exact same thing.

664
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:48,810
Scott: So how do I talk to just room without talking to anyone else?

665
00:43:49,031 --> 00:43:50,316
Rym: Alright, listen, we can go up a level.

666
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,803
Rym: So, you know my IP address.

667
00:43:52,185 --> 00:43:52,446
Rym: Okay.

668
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:53,350
Rym: Alright, so what does it do?

669
00:43:54,350 --> 00:44:03,090
Scott: Okay, so I'm just curious here how much you know this how much I know this Alright, so I decide that I'm going to send write something to rims IP address.

670
00:44:03,371 --> 00:44:06,650
Scott: So first my computer looks at its network configuration.

671
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,069
Scott: It looks at the subnet mask.

672
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:16,090
Scott: Alright, and if the IP address is in the subnet mask Then it knows that Rym is on the local network and he is not on a remote network.

673
00:44:16,713 --> 00:44:17,718
Rym: That's a roundabout.

674
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:19,830
Rym: yeah, that's kind of true that is correct.

675
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:23,730
Rym: Yes, well it more has to do with whether or not you have a specific route.

676
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,010
Rym: You know at a higher level part of the pro.

677
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:31,510
Scott: I was about to say if the IP address is not in the subnet mask, then it will look at the default gateway.

678
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:33,497
Rym: Yeah, but then it still does the same thing.

679
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:44,905
Rym: because if you connect to the default gateway the router, you know The router that you've got connecting your computers to the internet old listeners you connect to that IP and then that basically makes its own Connection out to whatever you're doing.

680
00:44:45,128 --> 00:44:48,383
Scott: Yep Anyway, so let's say I'm gonna send the packet to Rym.

681
00:44:48,423 --> 00:44:49,730
Scott: He's in the local network, right?

682
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,298
Scott: So he's in within the side.

683
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:59,673
Rym: that was the first thing that comes out of your computer The very first thing when you're trying to send data to me on the local network and all you know is my IP I believe the ARP.

684
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:01,218
Scott: Yes, the ARP is the first thing.

685
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:03,206
Scott: so that stands for I have no clue.

686
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:06,156
Rym: address resolution protocol Alrighty, it's actually pretty straightforward.

687
00:45:06,256 --> 00:45:13,038
Scott: So the ARP goes out and it says hey, I'm looking for this Address and then rims.

688
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:16,434
Scott: computer would say hey, that's me I got that address.

689
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:17,517
Scott: So I go aha.

690
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,223
Scott: I see Rym over there.

691
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:20,788
Rym: Well, I don't just say I've got that address.

692
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:26,865
Rym: I say I Own that Mac address which it figures this out on the physical level with a bit mask.

693
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:32,305
Rym: and then it responds and says Not only do I know is that me here is my Mac address.

694
00:45:32,325 --> 00:45:38,086
Rym: and then Scott's computer says Okay, and caches that and then sends to the IP address of me the actual data.

695
00:45:38,106 --> 00:45:41,053
Rym: He wanted to send but Encapsulated in that.

696
00:45:41,093 --> 00:45:46,549
Rym: you know that that that IP packet that data is itself encapsulated into.

697
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:59,770
Rym: I Don't want to get into the technical details of frames and windows and everything But it's basically encapsulated in one thing that says deliver me to this Mac address and the thing that delivers it Which is just the wire doesn't know shit about IP addresses.

698
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:06,650
Rym: All it knows is it takes it and it sends it to you know switch that Mac address or if it's a hub everybody.

699
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,227
Rym: Yep.

700
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:09,857
Scott: So that's that's how that works right.

701
00:46:09,877 --> 00:46:10,720
Scott: you can see others.

702
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,005
Scott: you can see how these layers right.

703
00:46:12,025 --> 00:46:16,909
Scott: so if I'm working with IP Addresses I don't have to think about the Mac addresses because that's just.

704
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:18,677
Scott: you know I'm one layer above that shit.

705
00:46:18,978 --> 00:46:20,464
Scott: if I'm working with Mac addresses.

706
00:46:20,484 --> 00:46:27,129
Scott: I don't have to think about Electricity right electricity is just taking care of I guess a simple way to explain it the OSI model.

707
00:46:27,832 --> 00:46:30,650
Rym: Abstracting this out is the same as encapsulation.

708
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:43,610
Rym: The physical layer is like an envelope that holds everything above it and inside of that There's an envelope of the data link and inside of that There's an envelope with the network and you open all the envelopes and seal all the envelopes up and down the chain at both ends.

709
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:46,850
Scott: Yeah, imagine if like there were there's a post office.

710
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:50,130
Scott: Well, there is a post office right and they have the address of your house.

711
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:55,590
Scott: But then the envelope gets to your house and it says, you know apartment 1a in this building.

712
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,610
Scott: But then you open the envelope and it says deliver to the desk.

713
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:01,943
Scott: So now you've got an address within an address.

714
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:02,969
Scott: You got to go find that dog.

715
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:04,876
Rym: I heard you like to dress see.

716
00:47:04,896 --> 00:47:12,610
Scott: so then you bring the envelope to that desk and the guy at the desk opens the envelope And it says this will be delivered to drawer number three in this desk.

717
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,473
Scott: So now he has to put it in.

718
00:47:13,494 --> 00:47:20,810
Rym: drawer number three addresses an envelope like that and then inside I got an envelope that was like your right front pocket, right?

719
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:29,710
Scott: So then in drawer number three There's a midget and that midget opens up the envelope and it says give it to the third dust mite from the left Any right, so that's that's how this works.

720
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:37,979
Rym: I apologize that we keep saying the same thing over and over again But I realize every time I've ever taught this I mean, I've actually taught classes on this stuff Mostly to like high school kids back when I was IBM.

721
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:38,240
Rym: Mm-hmm.

722
00:47:38,863 --> 00:47:45,423
Scott: I always had diagrams that I pointed at examples Plus even if you explain to people they still don't sort of understand.

723
00:47:45,443 --> 00:47:47,475
Scott: and the thing is this is not just Networking right.

724
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:51,114
Scott: pretty much everything you do in computing Follows this model, right?

725
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,238
Scott: So I'm a programmer right?

726
00:47:52,258 --> 00:47:53,121
Scott: So I'm programming.

727
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:55,430
Scott: I don't have to think about the transistors flipping anymore.

728
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,785
Scott: I mean I could I was programming an Altair right, but I'm not.

729
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:04,990
Scott: so on top of that You've got you know, you've got the machine the assembly language in the CPU.

730
00:48:05,211 --> 00:48:15,450
Rym: But Scott you're writing a program that itself Simulates the physical interactions of transistors and then you use those transistors to build the OSI model again on top of it.

731
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,946
Scott: Well, I could even do some FPGA and then she gets real crazy.

732
00:48:18,007 --> 00:48:20,212
Rym: Oh, man Right.

733
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:30,490
Scott: So and then on top of that you've got a programming language like C where C, you know abstracts away a lot of the machine Language, but it doesn't abstract away things like memory management, right?

734
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:35,950
Scott: But then you got a computer programming language like Java or Python or Ruby which abstracts.

735
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,850
Scott: It's even a layer on top of C where it abstracts away the memory management.

736
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,301
Scott: This is the garbage collector and those sorts of things.

737
00:48:42,342 --> 00:48:54,990
Scott: You don't have to think about the RAM anymore You know, all you have to think about is you know, just these concepts of variables and you know Moving data around and you don't even have to really think about the hardware of the computer at all in a way.

738
00:48:55,150 --> 00:49:02,179
Scott: And then on top of that you might be using an application that you know For example something like game maker.

739
00:49:02,379 --> 00:49:05,750
Scott: right game maker is a program that is written in another programming language.

740
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,764
Scott: You can use it to make a game Right with just a GUI by clicking on pictures or flash.

741
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:12,010
Scott: you can do the same thing, right?

742
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:16,190
Scott: You know, but and then flash has action script which is then again a layer on top.

743
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:16,451
Scott: You know

744
00:49:16,712 --> 00:49:29,742
Rym: when I was really young like way young and I was playing with Q basic on the school's computer Yeah, I had this sudden revelation when I realized that the interpreter I was using was written in a language Yeah, that it was like I suddenly was like wait a minute.

745
00:49:29,963 --> 00:49:30,224
Scott: Yep.

746
00:49:30,485 --> 00:49:31,490
Rym: What's at the bottom?

747
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,069
Rym: Yep, and then that started my long road to where I am now.

748
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:40,032
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you want to I mean this is the one thing that confused me for the longest time turtles all the way Down right?

749
00:49:40,092 --> 00:49:43,187
Scott: It is turtles all the way down is how do you translate from?

750
00:49:43,207 --> 00:49:43,850
Scott: you know?

751
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,690
Scott: How do you get to difference between typing in letters down to the electrons?

752
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,814
Scott: It seems like there's some sort of barrier in between.

753
00:49:49,874 --> 00:49:50,976
Scott: How does that shit work?

754
00:49:51,217 --> 00:49:55,948
Scott: That's assembly, right and Pretty much the way it works is.

755
00:49:56,068 --> 00:50:06,280
Scott: you know, this is this assembly language and an assembly language, you know If you look at assembly language the way people type it it looks like, you know move L percent RDB space.

756
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:09,473
Scott: You know, you know percent our DQ.

757
00:50:09,553 --> 00:50:11,120
Scott: It's basically just binary.

758
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:14,906
Scott: That's what it looks like when you're typing it in.

759
00:50:14,966 --> 00:50:24,995
Scott: but the fact is that directly translates to something like zero zero one zero one zero Right and that zero one zero zero literally translates to zero.

760
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,940
Scott: turn this trend turn this wire.

761
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:28,405
Scott: No electricity one.

762
00:50:28,727 --> 00:50:30,714
Scott: this wire has electricity zero.

763
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:33,042
Scott: This wire does not have electricity Right.

764
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,627
Rym: So now think about that.

765
00:50:34,707 --> 00:50:40,127
Scott: when all those payments on the bottom of your CPU are gonna have electricity going into them or out Or not.

766
00:50:40,147 --> 00:50:46,220
Rym: when you're writing Applications you it is no different than physically controlling machines.

767
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,340
Rym: You're physically controlling real moving things with mass, right?

768
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,458
Scott: So if you have a 64-bit processor, that means that the instructions are 64-bit.

769
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,817
Scott: So imagine you have 64 on and off switches in front of you.

770
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:00,932
Scott: That's it Yeah and you well and so you turn them on and off.

771
00:51:01,093 --> 00:51:05,852
Scott: and this you know, There's two to the power of 64 different combinations of ways.

772
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:09,003
Scott: You can turn them on and off which is a lot It's bajillions.

773
00:51:09,023 --> 00:51:12,376
Scott: All right, and that is the number of possible instructions.

774
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:13,038
Scott: There could be.

775
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:26,632
Scott: obviously They don't actually have that many instructions because you don't need that many Right, but that's how many instructions there could be and each so multiply might be zero zero zero zero one two one zero Right, whatever, you know 64 ones and zeros.

776
00:51:26,832 --> 00:51:28,600
Scott: one combination of them is multiply.

777
00:51:29,224 --> 00:51:31,820
Scott: So then after that you got to say well, which numbers do you want to multiply?

778
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,371
Scott: So there's two more 64-bit numbers which are in binary.

779
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:42,242
Scott: and then so if you send all those bits into the CPU Outcomes the other end the multiplied, you know The two numbers.

780
00:51:42,363 --> 00:51:45,793
Scott: another 64-bit number which is the multiplied number is the result.

781
00:51:46,034 --> 00:51:46,836
Rym: That was a pretty good.

782
00:51:46,977 --> 00:51:47,960
Rym: we abstract all that.

783
00:51:48,262 --> 00:51:50,260
Rym: Yeah, we abstract all that because it's boring.

784
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,496
Scott: I don't have to remember right what the bits are to.

785
00:51:53,596 --> 00:52:04,500
Rym: actually, you know Tell an x86 CPU to multiply two numbers by each other to conceptualize it a little more simply like to back up even and abstraction Is like an analogy and note how I used a simile.

786
00:52:06,442 --> 00:52:13,109
Rym: But in that when you abstract something like say I'm trying to program a Scott simulator Okay, I'm going to abstract Scott in a way.

787
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:18,612
Scott: He's not gonna program like the lungs breathing You know, that's that's not the point of the Scott simulator.

788
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:21,902
Rym: No, I might make a very detailed Abstraction.

789
00:52:22,323 --> 00:52:25,873
Rym: it might approach a real Scott but much like analogies.

790
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:29,786
Rym: if your if your analogy never breaks down It is not an analogy.

791
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:30,790
Rym: It is the thing.

792
00:52:31,091 --> 00:52:40,280
Rym: if I'm able to perfectly emulate Scott Absolutely, actually every single sub, you know sub atomic particle then I have made a Scott.

793
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,202
Rym: Yeah, straight up.

794
00:52:41,222 --> 00:52:43,308
Rym: There's no difference between that Scott and this Scott.

795
00:52:43,428 --> 00:52:47,720
Rym: Mm-hmm except locality, but that's yeah, you get the point.

796
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,793
Rym: So say I want to write a ticketing system.

797
00:52:51,054 --> 00:52:52,420
Rym: I want to track problems.

798
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:54,607
Rym: I'm abstracting problems.

799
00:52:54,928 --> 00:52:58,780
Rym: a lot of people who just get into programming don't actually abstract enough.

800
00:52:58,821 --> 00:53:01,325
Rym: They think too close like alright I'm making a ticket.

801
00:53:01,365 --> 00:53:08,297
Rym: tickets are like this and they've kind of worked through when really they should back up and say What am I trying to accomplish and then abstract that?

802
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:12,712
Rym: All right What are the basic components of a problem?

803
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:24,620
Rym: Well a problem has a person who opened the problem It has a solution and as the steps I took along the way to fix it It has the money it cost the time I spent on it, you know all these things and that is abstraction.

804
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,420
Rym: You're abstracting a problem into something that you can then do something with.

805
00:53:27,681 --> 00:53:37,600
Scott: Yeah, I mean because the reason that works, you know abstraction is progress right is because number one We've solved most of the problems of the world right especially on low levels, right?

806
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:41,411
Scott: For example, we've solved the problem of HTTP, right?

807
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:44,480
Scott: I mean there are perfect implementations of HTTP stacks.

808
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,220
Scott: They're perfect effectively perfect implementations of TCP IP stacks.

809
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:53,880
Scott: You're not gonna write a better TCP IP stack or you're not gonna write a better HTTP client or server.

810
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:55,530
Scott: It's not likely right.

811
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:57,240
Scott: what you want to write is a website.

812
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,952
Scott: Technically you could write a website in assembly language, right?

813
00:54:02,012 --> 00:54:04,420
Scott: You would have to write a TCP IP stack.

814
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:08,633
Scott: You have to write, you know an HTTP client and a server.

815
00:54:09,054 --> 00:54:10,980
Scott: you would have to write all the memory management.

816
00:54:11,442 --> 00:54:14,516
Scott: You would have to write an HTTP, you know all this stuff you would have to write.

817
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:21,563
Scott: instead You just want to reuse the stuff that's already been written and you only want to worry about the problems that you Care about.

818
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:25,520
Scott: the things that you care about are what do my website look like and how does my website work?

819
00:54:25,982 --> 00:54:38,080
Scott: and if you actually have to Rewrite or think about the electricity on the wire, which is something that's happening when you're visiting a website While you're making your website, you're never gonna solve any website problems.

820
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,920
Scott: You know, where would Google be if they actually had to worry about the electricity on the wires directly, right?

821
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,340
Rym: Well, they don't because there's a lot of it.

822
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,089
Scott: It costs a lot of money saying if they had to worry about that from the beginning They only wanted to solve the problem of searching.

823
00:54:49,189 --> 00:54:55,400
Scott: if they had to solve the problem of electricity and on a wire Before they could solve the problem of searching they never would have solved the problem of searching.

824
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:55,683
Scott: Of course

825
00:54:55,703 --> 00:55:08,438
Rym: this gets into even not just abstraction But also, you know standing on the shoulders of giants that every human alive today At least if you live in a society that is free and you are not Disadvantaged due to the fact that we're not as humans that good at this stuff.

826
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:11,580
Rym: yet You know society and being nice to each other and everything.

827
00:55:12,282 --> 00:55:21,000
Rym: You basically have this huge set of resources that are the consist Consituent knowledge of everyone that came before and most of it's on the internet.

828
00:55:21,562 --> 00:55:27,987
Rym: So you start at this high level and you can pick very high level problems to solve because you're not worried about Instantiating food on a given day.

829
00:55:28,188 --> 00:55:28,750
Scott: It's like all right.

830
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:31,100
Scott: Think about something that's more accessible to computers, right?

831
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,500
Scott: Let's say you're a chef, right?

832
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:37,616
Scott: Imagine if you wanted to become a chef you had to reinvent knives and knife sharpening.

833
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:42,424
Scott: you had to reinvent forging Right, you had to reinvent Mining of metals.

834
00:55:42,705 --> 00:55:44,893
Scott: you had to reinvent, you know the fire.

835
00:55:44,913 --> 00:55:47,604
Scott: you had to reinvent ovens You had to reinvent.

836
00:55:47,725 --> 00:55:49,655
Rym: I like how fire gets a definite article right?

837
00:55:49,675 --> 00:55:50,620
Rym: I know I go too far.

838
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:52,240
Scott: Oh my god.

839
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:56,000
Scott: Imagine if you had to reinvent all those things and build your own oven.

840
00:55:56,181 --> 00:55:57,286
Rym: Oh, you mean like a bunch.

841
00:55:57,467 --> 00:55:59,920
Rym: you mean like if a biologist had to reinvent calculus.

842
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,883
Scott: Yeah You know.

843
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:07,118
Scott: or make your own knives while someone might really like to do that and I say go for it.

844
00:56:07,138 --> 00:56:07,640
Scott: That's awesome.

845
00:56:07,841 --> 00:56:17,780
Scott: Right, it's not gonna cut a tomato, but right if your job is chef You're really want to just think about the recipe and the preparation of the food to make it as good as possible.

846
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,500
Rym: It also to use a less, you know silly example because this is kind of silly to think art.

847
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,030
Rym: I want to be a chef.

848
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:22,560
Rym: I want to do all this.

849
00:56:22,862 --> 00:56:26,400
Rym: What if you're a chef and you really focus on cutting the tomatoes into?

850
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:33,031
Rym: Absolute perfect cubes when really that's not the important part That's not the part that you want to get to.

851
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:36,967
Scott: it might be depending on what you're doing But it's rarely most likely not we.

852
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:41,964
Rym: actually we use these this a lot in the Tuesday shows and in our lectures on gaming Role-playing games.

853
00:56:42,245 --> 00:56:46,360
Rym: a lot of people who get sick of Dungeons & Dragons get sick of it because it doesn't abstract the boring shit.

854
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,520
Rym: Yeah, and games like burning wheel?

855
00:56:48,841 --> 00:57:03,117
Rym: They instead of saying I have 58 electron pieces and one platinum piece and five rubies you say I have a level four Money, yep, and you abstract all that haggling and buying stuff and keeping track to.

856
00:57:03,438 --> 00:57:04,120
Rym: I roll the dice once.

857
00:57:04,202 --> 00:57:05,140
Rym: Yes, I can afford the sword.

858
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:06,439
Rym: No I can't afford the sword.

859
00:57:06,669 --> 00:57:11,780
Rym: Yep and you get and you get to skip the boring part of buying the sword and get to the awesome part of using the.

860
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:24,256
Scott: So if you want some you want to haggle you make it one easier or one point harder to Succeed at that roll of the dice, you know Basically you come up with some system that is not the original system because it was the original.

861
00:57:24,296 --> 00:57:27,627
Scott: if it was actually money It wouldn't be it wouldn't be an analogy.

862
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:28,691
Scott: It would be the actual thing.

863
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,420
Scott: All right, so you come up with something that is simpler.

864
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:32,825
Rym: There's a role-playing game.

865
00:57:33,307 --> 00:57:36,780
Rym: Well, it's designed to use real money between the game master and the players.

866
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:39,060
Scott: What are you role-playing as stock brokers?

867
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:42,718
Rym: No, I know merchants, but I like we could make some money with this.

868
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:46,544
Scott: Love tournaments at bags.

869
00:57:46,684 --> 00:57:47,005
Rym: Yeah.

870
00:57:47,225 --> 00:57:47,546
Scott: Yeah.

871
00:57:48,248 --> 00:57:51,957
Rym: I'm sure that these stats as a player player versus environment.

872
00:57:51,997 --> 00:58:02,809
Scott: Of course, of course Ah Plus one sword actually a poker based PVP RPG was real money as it now with real money, but it's been done.

873
00:58:02,829 --> 00:58:03,370
Scott: stay with real money.

874
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:08,940
Scott: Let's take a little luck out of it add a little role-playing to it.

875
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,260
Rym: We should write the rules and just put something online and watch the crazy chaos is gonna ensue.

876
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,102
Scott: Oh, we should make.

877
00:58:14,464 --> 00:58:20,104
Scott: we should make a website where you can play it to avoid all the regulations about online poker because it's not Poker.

878
00:58:20,511 --> 00:58:22,786
Rym: Nah Playing and all we do.

879
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:24,754
Rym: here's the brilliant part all you do.

880
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:25,356
Scott: and here's how.

881
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,420
Rym: here's how Scott let's hear me out.

882
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,273
Rym: You keep the books of who has how much money in each local gaming group.

883
00:58:30,554 --> 00:58:32,040
Rym: You keep it on the server for them.

884
00:58:32,566 --> 00:58:33,619
Rym: You're not handling money.

885
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:43,469
Rym: You're just handling fake money and you tell people you shouldn't use this to determine how much money to give your friends and who owes you how much money and They will.

886
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:50,763
Scott: anyway I was thinking that everyone would send you a money which should be the monthly fee and then you would give out Prizes.

887
00:58:51,003 --> 00:58:53,732
Rym: now giving out prizes is a thorny ground.

888
00:58:53,772 --> 00:58:59,431
Rym: you give out virtual fucking prizes because fuck that The prize is never abstract prizes.

889
00:59:03,382 --> 00:59:06,294
Scott: Yes, here's a picture of a present.

890
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,177
Rym: here's a picture of a $20 bill.

891
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,407
Scott: Here's a picture of Andrew Jackson.

892
00:59:10,427 --> 00:59:13,380
Scott: It's actually no really is a photo.

893
00:59:16,447 --> 00:59:17,820
Scott: So now there's no numbers next to him.

894
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:24,128
Rym: If everything we said doesn't make sense just follow the Wikipedia link that I'm gonna put.

895
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:25,550
Rym: I'm sure the Wikipedia paid it.

896
00:59:26,482 --> 00:59:29,740
Rym: Yes, the Wikipedia page has a picture of the OSI model.

897
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:42,520
Scott: Yeah, but I mean this this concept of abstraction is pretty much the key and core concept to modern Computing, you know for any you know, whether you're IT whether you're CS what you know, even if you're in you know.

898
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:46,051
Scott: I mean like think about biologists, you know, think about biology.

899
00:59:46,112 --> 00:59:48,560
Scott: Technically this physics going on way down there.

900
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,191
Rym: You know biology is just abstracted physics, right?

901
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:56,840
Scott: You know, and then this it's also abstract that You know this, you know, everything is abstraction, right?

902
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,940
Scott: You want to think about a problem on a higher abstraction level right to figure it out?

903
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:11,005
Scott: Because if you actually had to think about what every freaking Electron and subatomic particle was doing when DNA was restructuring itself now You might need to zoom in.

904
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,029
Scott: You would never get it all.

905
01:00:12,129 --> 01:00:16,568
Rym: You might have a problem where you do have to zoom in way low and Some things can't be that abstracted.

906
01:00:16,709 --> 01:00:17,050
Rym: That is true.

907
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,060
Rym: But that's not where you should start.

908
01:00:19,602 --> 01:00:24,800
Rym: I mean, I realize as we won't talk about inheritance or anything or classes or abstract classes.

909
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:29,660
Scott: Well, I could write a program in Python and it might have a problem where there's too much memory.

910
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:34,100
Scott: It's using all the memory on the computer and I might have to look one level lower.

911
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,768
Scott: You know on the abstraction Let you know to see where the problem is.

912
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:41,420
Scott: if I can't find the problem in the Python code itself that happens pretty often.

913
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:53,168
Scott: But you don't start, you know, that does not an excuse or a good reason to throw away You know this higher level abstraction and write everything in C because then everything is gonna be a pain in the ass Or even within a simple application.

914
01:00:53,209 --> 01:00:54,800
Rym: say you're simulating, I don't know, fireman.

915
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:01,000
Rym: So you write like the fireman class and then you inherit down and make very specific implementations of fireman.

916
01:01:01,722 --> 01:01:11,394
Rym: You don't start with the very specific implementations when you're writing code because then when you're trying to work up to the more abstract stuff You're basically Guaranteed to have made a terrible mistake.

917
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:16,320
Scott: Yeah All right, if you don't get by now and you know, it's just real important.

918
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:19,113
Scott: So we want to give a lot of examples and we don't have any visuals.

919
01:01:19,153 --> 01:01:20,660
Scott: So we want to give a lot of examples.

920
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:24,331
Rym: I wanted to say like, how can she something?

921
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,096
Rym: but I got nothing here.

922
01:01:25,216 --> 01:01:27,246
Scott: No I didn't give any opportunities.

923
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:28,572
Rym: It's not the right time for that.

924
01:01:28,612 --> 01:01:29,155
Rym: I got to save it.

925
01:01:29,235 --> 01:01:30,180
Scott: You are who I thought you were.

926
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:41,330
Rym: Mmm, this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

927
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:46,130
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

928
01:01:46,431 --> 01:01:48,398
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

929
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:51,450
Scott: crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

930
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:59,130
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.
