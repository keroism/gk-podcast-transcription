00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,327
Rym: It's Wednesday April 28th.

2
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:12,391
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:14,580
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:16,270
Rym: I'm gonna say something really lame right now.

5
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:21,710
Rym: We talked about mo comics Comics that we got at the mocha.

6
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:23,440
Scott: You can just cut that second part out.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,918
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:30,292
Rym: So this weekend Scott didn't participate.

9
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:31,820
Rym: He's not a karaoke kind of guy.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,905
Rym: I don't really blame him for.

11
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:43,636
Rym: you have to be a certain kind of person to enjoy karaoke Someone who is Masochistic and or has quality singing skills, but you know I don't want to get.

12
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:44,760
Rym: I'm not gonna tell the whole story.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,924
Rym: We had a good time doing some Japanese style karaoke in Astoria at a place We've never been to before.

14
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:56,279
Rym: they had a good selection of English and Japanese music, but some surprising highlights that bear noting.

15
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:01,519
Rym: Item the first our friend Natalie can sing the najibudis song.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,427
Scott: Surprisingly well, what song is it?

17
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:07,140
Rym: the ones that ghost in the shell standalone complex, okay?

18
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,098
Rym: It was in there.

19
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,545
Rym: You know the song in Russian?

20
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:14,110
Rym: yeah, and I see it in the queue because it shows you at the bottom like here the next few songs.

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,903
Rym: I'm like Inner universe.

22
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:17,167
Rym: is that the ghost in the shell song?

23
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,113
Rym: who's gonna sing the Russian song?

24
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:22,144
Rym: and she sang it really well Hey item.

25
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:23,448
Rym: the second much more important.

26
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:33,260
Rym: We did springtime for Hitler an old classic and for In Germany don't be stupid be a smarty come and join the Nazi Party.

27
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:36,771
Rym: So oh well that is a fun song to do.

28
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:37,835
Rym: it is hilarious.

29
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:38,798
Rym: You know everything about.

30
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:46,445
Rym: it is great Unless the CD or whatever it is in the karaoke machine breaks Midway through the song.

31
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:48,976
Rym: uh-huh so we're singing it and suddenly.

32
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:49,839
Rym: There's no more music.

33
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:55,796
Rym: Carl you know uncle yo keep singing so I keep singing, but without the backing music.

34
00:01:55,836 --> 00:02:01,518
Rym: It's kind of this very scary I don't know mildly offensive song.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,272
Scott: It's always been crazy currently offensive with the music.

36
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:06,960
Scott: That's the point with the music.

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,060
Rym: It's not so offensive because you kind of it is obvious to even as someone who's never seen the the musical.

38
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:14,738
Rym: What is going on here?

39
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:24,129
Rym: But when there is no backing music and you're looking at the karaoke machine and the lyrics are I'm going to read the lyrics from This portion the fuhrer is coming.

40
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,300
Rym: Heil Hitler Heil Hitler Heil Hitler.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,560
Rym: springtime for Hitler and Germany Heil Hitler yeah, of course we sang the entire song all the way through with no backing music.

42
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:39,985
Scott: Maybe that.

43
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:58,668
Scott: maybe though this will create some sort of mean we could do is we could take inverse karaoke tracks right lyric tracks from various songs and change the bat just replace the backing music and Then the whole song changes sort of like when they do the movie trailers And it makes it look like a psycho movie.

44
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,900
Scott: is you know a romantic cop or a feel-good or a buddy movie or whatever?

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,403
Rym: I think the best one of those was Shining.

46
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:09,960
Scott: yeah, we could you know so we could do that for just music straight up.

47
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,646
Rym: I think what made it eerie though?

48
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,890
Rym: the Heil Hitler part was just.

49
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:16,338
Rym: you know everyone down the hall is looking at our room like What the fuck?

50
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,520
Rym: But uncle yo can sing pretty damn well.

51
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:26,809
Rym: So he's kind of actually singing this thing with no music behind it And I don't know it was something that you had to see.

52
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:30,119
Scott: I mean you know that's what he practices being an entertainer.

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,094
Scott: Yeah, you know if you practice anything you will get skills at it.

54
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:34,656
Rym: God.

55
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:35,519
Rym: What about the harmonica?

56
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,249
Scott: You have to practice.

57
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:43,020
Scott: I said if you practice You have to practice it like Street Fighter, so what do you got for me?

58
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,549
Rym: I imagine your news is up better than my news.

59
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:46,532
Scott: Oh news.

60
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:48,780
Scott: I was still like in an opening bit mode.

61
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,829
Scott: There's not really any exciting news.

62
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:58,754
Scott: I mean there's some you know comicky like Foreshadowing of the San Diego comic-con because it's like two months out.

63
00:03:58,774 --> 00:03:59,980
Scott: so the foreshadowing begins.

64
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,749
Scott: You know how that goes?

65
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,635
Rym: that's a x-men Misfits is done.

66
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:10,126
Scott: No whatever but we I'm so tired.

67
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:12,836
Rym: I don't know why but anyway didn't even do a show on Monday.

68
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:13,820
Scott: I had nothing to do with that.

69
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,517
Scott: I just not sleep in anyway.

70
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:36,640
Scott: Last week we went to this special event in the city at the Center for book arts Which I did not know existed, but apparently it is an awesome place, and if you want to learn like bookbinding or Like how to use a letterpress and do typesetting or anything that is you know book arts You can totally go there and pay for classes that are really reasonable.

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,200
Scott: And I'm thinking you know I didn't sign up because the class started the next day And I was like oh, I can't just start a class tomorrow.

72
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:49,539
Rym: Yep, especially cuz we're gonna have like if you do that or if we both do something like that We got a document the whole process because people don't know about this stuff.

73
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,389
Scott: No, but you know I think what I'm gonna.

74
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,360
Scott: Do is you know eventually right?

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,838
Scott: It's like you know I got to solely build up And I think starting that you know the next time they have a semester or a quarter or whatever they have.

76
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:02,125
Scott: you know I'm gonna Take a class and then I'm just.

77
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:02,727
Scott: I'm always.

78
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:06,780
Scott: I'm gonna try to always be in one class of some sort at some place.

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,227
Scott: cuz There is classes for everything in the city.

80
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,292
Scott: You can take a class at like the museum about like you know Digging up archaeology.

81
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:16,260
Scott: so you could take a class.

82
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:17,545
Rym: It's funny.

83
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:19,500
Scott: You know learn into any musical instrument.

84
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,176
Scott: You can imagine you could take a class in like oboe or you could go and take a about hobo.

85
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:26,420
Rym: you could take a hobo class.

86
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,225
Scott: I'm sure you can go.

87
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:34,080
Scott: You know work at the shelter and learn all about hobos and You know you could do any kind of class, so why do anything?

88
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:37,753
Scott: So why would I not you know given the opportunity go and just.

89
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:42,012
Scott: you know I know I don't need to like go to night School and become like a full-on something.

90
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:43,300
Scott: I don't have time or effort for that.

91
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,127
Scott: But to take a non graded non school class and just one thing at a time I can build up so many skills.

92
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:58,700
Scott: if you consider like each class taking like you know a few months in a year I can learn three skills Like way better than most people know them.

93
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,854
Scott: I mean how many people even know any letter press or typesetting at all?

94
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,180
Rym: not many of course.

95
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,888
Rym: There's a problem here you realize.

96
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,637
Rym: so you want to level up all these skills.

97
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:06,918
Rym: right.

98
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:13,660
Scott: the level That's right, but it'd be like taking level one of rogue when you're a wizard Just you know or taking level one a fighter when you're well.

99
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,782
Scott: Do you know the sorcerer just to get a fighter just to get the saving throw and just to get all those feats Right?

100
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:20,909
Scott: so this is what it is.

101
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,440
Scott: I'm basically get all these feats.

102
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,271
Rym: But the trouble is look at the burning wheel book.

103
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:30,570
Rym: you realize that training gives you like nothing compared to putting yourself in mortal danger.

104
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,064
Rym: if you if you had a guy appointed a gun at you said buying this book or You're dead.

105
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:35,719
Rym: You would level up a lot faster.

106
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:39,560
Scott: Well, I think the thing is is that you know I'm paying money for it.

107
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,639
Scott: So that is a you know it's like I'm paying for this.

108
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:46,040
Scott: It's not like college or someone else is paying for it or me paying for it indirectly.

109
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:53,219
Rym: There's like a direct paying that is I got a difference if I had taken cash out of my bank account and given it to RIT.

110
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,179
Scott: No you give it to each professor as you come into the class every day like an arcade even if you don't show up.

111
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,519
Rym: Yeah, I think I would have gone to a lot more class.

112
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:04,399
Rym: I would have felt real bad about skipping.

113
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:09,895
Scott: yeah If you skip a class you show up next time and he's basically like double cost you'd base pay for the class you missed And a late fee.

114
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,745
Rym: Like I'm not missing any but it was funny because I was independently thinking about all these classes And I've narrowed it down.

115
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:19,960
Rym: there are three different types of classes that I'm choosing between.

116
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,909
Rym: I don't know if I'll do the book arts hmm.

117
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:29,136
Rym: I either want to do kung fu again That's a good kind of class or I found parkour classes like straight-up class.

118
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:30,480
Rym: Yeah, they did okay.

119
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:34,120
Rym: Well, I'm gonna see because this weekend Phil's coming out, so we're gonna try to do some parkour.

120
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,727
Rym: I'm gonna see if I break my hip or not.

121
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:36,429
Scott: when's he coming out?

122
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,020
Scott: where are we gonna do some burning wheel on Saturday?

123
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,903
Rym: So I'm gonna schedule.

124
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:41,248
Rym: I'll figure all that out all right.

125
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,040
Rym: It doesn't seem like everyone is committed to doing it on that day.

126
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,105
Scott: Anyway, I don't know either.

127
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:45,929
Scott: We got to figure it out.

128
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:48,180
Rym: Maybe we'll push the burning dwarves back into something else.

129
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:48,848
Scott: We'll see.

130
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:49,639
Scott: we gotta do something.

131
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:56,700
Rym: Let's play Street Fighter, but the third parkour Third thing that I'm thinking about and I found a place.

132
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:59,258
Rym: It's real cheap, and I wanted to do this in Beacon.

133
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,680
Rym: the only reason I didn't was that it was a pain in the ass with the train.

134
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:02,928
Rym: I want to for real.

135
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,520
Rym: just finally take motorcycle lessons.

136
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:14,600
Rym: Yeah I want to do that because I Imagine I was talking to scojo this weekend about the shore and like going down to the shore for a weekend And I imagine just getting on my motorcycle and going down to the shore on like a Friday.

137
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,791
Scott: Well, here's what we can do right.

138
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:16,517
Scott: so check this out.

139
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,465
Scott: if You know you said you can just play.

140
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:21,232
Scott: put the motorcycle behind the building for free.

141
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,677
Rym: right one motorcycle.

142
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:23,339
Rym: I don't know about two.

143
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,069
Scott: Yeah, maybe the other thing we could do right.

144
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,999
Rym: We could split a parking space and park both motorcycles at.

145
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,823
Scott: well We could also.

146
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:32,152
Scott: you know motorcycles don't really need a parking space.

147
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:34,159
Scott: you could put them in like Manhattan mini storage.

148
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:37,220
Scott: Yeah, you know we could put them in like Jersey stories.

149
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:39,953
Rym: I'll just roll them into my building up the freight elevator.

150
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,120
Scott: basically take the path train.

151
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,885
Scott: You know cuz what do we?

152
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:43,600
Scott: you're not gonna need them to go around in the city.

153
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,440
Scott: We only need it when we leave and mostly to go right around in the city.

154
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,688
Rym: I'm actually thinking about getting a Vespa at some point.

155
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:51,314
Scott: No so not good.

156
00:08:51,394 --> 00:08:53,040
Rym: Why what's wrong with the Vespa?

157
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,286
Rym: They're great for going to the grocery.

158
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,029
Scott: They're all.

159
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,653
Scott: no they're not.

160
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:57,100
Scott: you can't put any groceries in there.

161
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,715
Rym: Put a lot of groceries in there, and they're mad.

162
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:03,545
Rym: dorky Isn't your soul philosophy?

163
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:04,809
Rym: don't care what people think about you.

164
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,873
Rym: It's gig nights.

165
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:07,780
Scott: Are you gonna get a motorcycle with saddlebags?

166
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:14,959
Rym: I'm probably gonna get either a state like a half cruiser or some sort of cross rocket.

167
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,711
Rym: You know the forward Talk about no groceries.

168
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:24,891
Rym: The motorcycle is not for groceries the motorcycles for the shore.

169
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:27,820
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna get Vespa is for groceries.

170
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,040
Scott: I'm gonna get a perfectly just normal.

171
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:33,971
Rym: Those you know the bikes that are the hybrid.

172
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:35,980
Rym: they have the electric engine so they're basically a motorcycle.

173
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,284
Scott: I'm talking about dorky.

174
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:38,007
Rym: They're cool.

175
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,171
Rym: No real cool.

176
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:43,128
Rym: You asked Steve Pomeroy or any of our friends at MIT They're gonna think it's cool.

177
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:44,980
Scott: Yeah, it but it practicality.

178
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:52,559
Rym: Imagine you're trying to bike over that stupid Queensborough Bridge, and you just turn on the the electric motor on the way up that hill.

179
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:55,029
Scott: Yeah, so now I look like a net in this.

180
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,498
Scott: Lance Armstrong comes buzzing by me near Who likes suits look stupid now?

181
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:03,679
Scott: At least if I'm pedaling it would be like all right you're trying.

182
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:06,640
Scott: Well, thank you're gonna you're gonna be you're gonna be Lance Armstrong one day.

183
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,800
Rym: But no if you now now now your lungs are not nearly freakishly large enough.

184
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,432
Scott: No, I actually have a speedometer on my bike now.

185
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:14,960
Scott: It's pretty it's pretty shit.

186
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:16,746
Scott: So I'm not sure.

187
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:20,879
Scott: if I'm not sure like do you know like like in the Tour de France like how fast do they go?

188
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,806
Rym: I don't in miles an hour on my bike like when I used to have a speedometer And I biked around a lot in high school.

189
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:34,315
Rym: I could easily maintain like 18 or 19 miles an hour Mmm, but that like on flats or whatever flats on hills.

190
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:35,760
Rym: I could get it up to like 40.

191
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:45,006
Scott: Yeah, my bike when I was coming down the Queensborough Bridge when it got to like 31 like basically Pedaling didn't do anything.

192
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:45,708
Scott: It was pretty much.

193
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:47,654
Scott: wind was was limiting and that was it.

194
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:50,163
Scott: you like no amount of pedaling You know.

195
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:54,720
Scott: no no if I cranked up to the maximum rpm of pedaling it would not have accelerated.

196
00:10:55,202 --> 00:11:00,419
Rym: See I would never go that fast on either on a bike that wasn't a racing bike or that had a front suspension.

197
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,005
Rym: without one Of those two I would not do that.

198
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:04,316
Scott: hmm, but you know basically it's like.

199
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:10,406
Scott: you know it's like 15 going around the city, but I'm not sure if I have the Circumference of the wheel correct.

200
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:13,900
Rym: you know you need one of those giant wheels the ones that are like you know the big old man.

201
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:16,591
Scott: See now here's you ready.

202
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:17,640
Rym: here is our mustache.

203
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:22,595
Scott: I I accidentally made a stupid thought and then my co-worker made the same stupid thought.

204
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:27,091
Scott: right so you put a magnet on a spoke And you put the sensor on the fork and the the.

205
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:31,872
Scott: the magnet comes with really close to the sensor But doesn't touch it right and that's how it knows.

206
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:35,690
Scott: and then accounts the revolutions And you tell it the circumference of the wheel.

207
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,458
Scott: yeah, and that's pretty much all you got to do.

208
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:41,233
Scott: so The co-worker made the same stupid first thought.

209
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:42,560
Rym: don't you have to put it on the outside?

210
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,520
Scott: No is doesn't it matter like how far you know?

211
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,471
Scott: Yeah, if it's too close to the the hub or too close to the Rym won't it?

212
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:50,575
Scott: won't it be wrong.

213
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,677
Scott: It's like no An rpm is an rpm.

214
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:58,010
Scott: You know the if the magnets going to close.

215
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:07,860
Scott: if the magnet is farther away closer to the Rym and farther from the hub It'll be going faster But it'll still go in a complete circle in the same amount of time as it would if it was right next to the hub.

216
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:08,883
Scott: You know what.

217
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:13,340
Scott: our one revolution still takes the same amount of time all right that's and travels the same amount of distance.

218
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,294
Rym: That's a common unexpected mistake, so what's number two?

219
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:17,400
Scott: What do you mean number two?

220
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,814
Rym: I thought you said there were two mistakes.

221
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,569
Scott: no I said we both made the same initial mistake.

222
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,180
Rym: so two mistakes, but between two people the same mistake.

223
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:26,167
Scott: Ah, I don't know what I remember saying.

224
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:26,729
Scott: two mistakes.

225
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:28,154
Rym: well regardless miles.

226
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:32,359
Rym: Oh shit moment a second ago I have a GPS app that tracks like where I run.

227
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:39,108
Rym: So I tried it out rollerblading to see like how fast I go and where I slow down and speed up And I realized just now that I left it on.

228
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:42,840
Rym: so it basically is still tracking my time right over there right now.

229
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,659
Scott: Why did you like punch me in the face with the microphone because the booms got in my way?

230
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:48,006
Scott: move?

231
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,732
Scott: Anyway, oh right.

232
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:59,020
Scott: so the center of a book Talk about a tangent whoa That's great, so we went to the center for book arts because they have an exhibit there.

233
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,329
Scott: They have like a. you know you can go for classes, but they also have exhibits to sort of you know And that's actually a clever move.

234
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,864
Scott: It's like they have the space in their room They're not using.

235
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:14,500
Scott: they can get people to come in to look at cool exhibits appeal to different groups And then you come in for the exhibit, and then they sell you on their classes which totally worked.

236
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:21,973
Scott: so their exhibit is pretty is about Garo which is the Pretty much the original gecky gov manga magazine.

237
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:29,796
Scott: they had a whole set of Just every issue of the first decade of Garo from like the early 60s to the early 70s.

238
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,059
Scott: every single issue was there.

239
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,852
Rym: apparently They're not that hard to come by.

240
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,129
Scott: yeah, I asked the guy I was like where did you get all these like?

241
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:35,814
Scott: I went to Japan.

242
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:36,700
Scott: I went use bookstores.

243
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,283
Scott: I bought him.

244
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:41,340
Scott: he's like they're not hard to find and they're not expensive, and I was like holy shit.

245
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:48,420
Scott: I'm like this is fucking as old as spider-man Which is really expensive, but it's cheap and easy to get and better and better.

246
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:54,914
Scott: But you know there was some really amazing In there you know and it was a fascinating exhibit.

247
00:13:55,476 --> 00:14:11,979
Rym: the only complaint I had was that we went to the the lecture afterward, and it was good, but it was basically kind of smarmy Doctorate guy trying to write a paper interviewing Japanese creator, and I can sum up every question He asked into one concise sentence.

248
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,020
Rym: Does this represent a penis?

249
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,329
Rym: Because it looks like it represents a penis.

250
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,740
Rym: and here are like ten examples Where you drew something that I think looks like a penis.

251
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:24,777
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't thinking about that when I made it.

252
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:27,989
Rym: He's like, but seriously look at this.

253
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,732
Rym: It's a penis.

254
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:29,094
Rym: Yeah.

255
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:30,400
Scott: Yeah, you know it was so great.

256
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,265
Scott: How he would you know.

257
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:33,560
Scott: pretty much all he did was he showed this lady's art?

258
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,143
Scott: Which is really great, and then he showed like comparisons with like you know other Japanese arts.

259
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:41,572
Rym: you know this one artist that she seemed to like like.

260
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:46,760
Rym: she'd admitted like she liked this artist and He pulls up here that guy's art, and he's like you really like this artist.

261
00:14:47,202 --> 00:15:00,955
Rym: She's like oh the composition to whatever whatever and then he's like okay I got her to admit that she likes him and then he proceeds to show all the crazy Perverted like old man schoolgirl pseudo rape penis stuff that the guy had drawn, and he's like.

262
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,740
Rym: so what about this picture?

263
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,037
Rym: Did you like?

264
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,778
Rym: It was kind of awesome.

265
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:13,500
Scott: Yeah, the one picture that I just remember is the one where that the girl she drew and like the whole background is white.

266
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:22,670
Scott: But the background the girls like feet are off the bottom of the page and the background between the girls legs is like all these Flowers, and it's bright yellow and everything.

267
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,353
Scott: and he's like really so this is not sexual Or referring to menstruation in any way shape or form.

268
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,276
Rym: She's like nope.

269
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:42,412
Scott: No just sitting there I mean, you know it's I mean the Japanese guests at conventions are you know that we're pretty used to them like always avoiding any Hentai or sexual topics which you'll discuss more.

270
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:48,078
Scott: my thing of the day, but You know it's funny to see someone actually be like look there it is.

271
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:50,242
Scott: So you.

272
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:53,472
Scott: it's like if you went to Gabe you know Benny arcade and we're like.

273
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,800
Scott: so see you drew this penis here.

274
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,053
Rym: He'd be like yep Tell me about it.

275
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:05,859
Scott: It's a you know quite a large dog nice and hairy.

276
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:16,788
Rym: So I don't want to talk about this at length, but it kind of epitomizes the Surprising lack of professionalism.

277
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:19,760
Rym: Well, I guess it's not surprising anymore in the American anime industry.

278
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:24,980
Rym: So the president and CEO of bangzoom, which is a dubbing company, right?

279
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,403
Rym: Yep, they dubbed a ton of anime.

280
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:32,319
Rym: basically said we're done unless you assholes start buying our anime and not just pirating all of it.

281
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:35,772
Rym: And he said straight up anime is going to die.

282
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:36,514
Rym: and he goes.

283
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:42,899
Rym: he basically seems to blame Piracy and fan subs for the fact that their dubs are not making money.

284
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,520
Rym: and Of course the obvious response to this is but what about things like crunchyroll?

285
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:55,818
Rym: I mean you can get most of this anime that kids are watching today Completely legitimately and people do get it completely legitimately and for free.

286
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:58,412
Scott: because yeah I basically stopped getting fat.

287
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:03,454
Scott: I mean I would get a fan some of the show I really wanted but that it's on crunchyroll.

288
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:08,233
Scott: So even though there's some ads there There's not enough to be annoying, you know, people don't download TV shows.

289
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:17,940
Scott: they go to Hulu because it's easier Yeah, and yet not because it's not because they care about legality But because it's easier to just go click click and it starts playing as opposed to find a torrent.

290
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:24,726
Rym: Download it get the codex then play it, but he basically says you assholes have to buy DVDs, which One?

291
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:25,800
Rym: I take issue with that statement.

292
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,839
Rym: I'll get to why in a second.

293
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:34,893
Rym: But when confronted with the fact that you can get a lot of this stuff for free legally He basically says well so far there's no successful way to model it.

294
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:36,418
Rym: monetize online entertainment.

295
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:39,018
Scott: So Why is anyone doing it?

296
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:51,281
Rym: But his argument that you should buy DVDs fails too because I note that I only buy DVDs of anime when they're one box sets of an entire show and two wicked cheap less than $20.

297
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:52,424
Scott: Yeah wicked cheap.

298
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:58,040
Rym: I think $25 is the most I would spend and that is for a like standalone complex level of show.

299
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:04,140
Rym: Yeah, like maybe Baccano or Durara I would pay 25 bucks for the whole the whole thing.

300
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,977
Rym: It would have to be the entire thing all in thin packs.

301
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:11,716
Scott: Yep Anyway, or in like one of the bricks the brick said like, you know, cuz it's you don't?

302
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:12,780
Scott: they're all in one package.

303
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:19,560
Scott: Anyway, yeah, I don't know I would go and discuss this same topic yet again, but didn't we do an episode?

304
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,814
Scott: Like this is not a charity.

305
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,846
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so there we go.

306
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:23,429
Scott: It's done.

307
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:26,040
Scott: I don't want to waste my breath anymore on these kind of people.

308
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:31,500
Scott: The only thing I guess I gotta add is like hey, you know, if you know never blame the customer.

309
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,307
Scott: It's all if your business is having a problem.

310
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,511
Scott: It's the business person's fault.

311
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:38,585
Scott: And you know what if an industry is dying an Industry is dying.

312
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:39,954
Scott: Why are you in a shitty business?

313
00:18:40,014 --> 00:18:40,980
Scott: Just go out of business.

314
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:47,720
Scott: I mean just because a business exists doesn't mean it has some right or need to stay in business.

315
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,391
Rym: I think there's a secondary thing here.

316
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:50,720
Scott: That's kind of go out of business.

317
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:55,439
Rym: So notice how it's the dubbing company that's having trouble.

318
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:05,440
Rym: I think part of the problem is that anime had a boom where a lot of like Semi mainstream people like a lot of people were just kind of watching anime on TV for a while and then that kind of faded.

319
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:10,839
Rym: The only time there's a market for dubs is when non anime fans watch anime on TV.

320
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:14,560
Rym: Anime fans like people who are into anime subtitles.

321
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:18,780
Rym: They're gonna watch subtitles and they're gonna go for fan subs if they can't get it any other way.

322
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:20,699
Scott: So look crunchyrolls all subtitles.

323
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,920
Scott: The dub is not making any money for the dub guy.

324
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:33,119
Rym: I think the dub guy is done anyway because what he needs to do is a lot of a lot of anime companies when they do release DVDs are doing sub only because DVDs are not gonna sell to anyone who wants to dub.

325
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:38,820
Rym: No The only people you can ever sell a dub to or TV networks and they're not selling it to TV networks the right ways.

326
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,880
Scott: That's the other thing right?

327
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,795
Scott: Is that look all the hot all the dubs that were actually on TV like late-night Cartoon Network.

328
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:46,520
Scott: We're from one dubbing place.

329
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,179
Scott: I don't know if that place that you know The same people that dubbed like ghost in the shell and cowboy bebop.

330
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,180
Scott: You know that one place that made all the high quality dubs and everyone else made the shitty ones that didn't get on TV.

331
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,820
Scott: So, oh they got on TV is bang zoom that the people who did the really good dubs or those the people who did some?

332
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,363
Scott: Shitty dubs.

333
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:05,068
Rym: I don't even know.

334
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:06,074
Scott: I don't even know either.

335
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:06,880
Rym: I have no idea.

336
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:12,920
Scott: So like if those are the ghosts in the shell cowboy bebop dubbing crew then oh then that's really in the shitter.

337
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:18,080
Scott: but if they're not that crew then Your dubs suck anyway.

338
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:30,167
Rym: So things of the day.

339
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:59,870
Rym: I would hope you've seen this but if you haven't I figure it's worth pointing out Basically in a special episode a special volume of new type in Japan, you know, there's no more new type USA Yeah But they had this whole thing about the otaku room in 1995 and today And it kind of has a depiction of like what a typical otaku's room looks like in these three eras.

340
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:03,801
Scott: And it's it's stereotypical yet accurate very accurate.

341
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,125
Rym: I would say like it like.

342
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:13,014
Rym: no one's room looked exactly like this I would say but the spirit of what everyone was like I think very much mirrors the way these Fictional rooms look.

343
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:24,770
Rym: it is just very interesting to note how the 1985 room looks pretty Happening and pretty relatively normal and cool and the 1995 room looks mostly the same just with better technology.

344
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:32,820
Rym: 2010 room half-naked girls moe crap pillows with naked girls on them.

345
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:37,045
Rym: It tells the tale these pictures and I'll leave it at that.

346
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:43,349
Scott: Hmm Yeah, so my thing today, you know, I think goes right along with that sort of right.

347
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,047
Scott: Basically what this dude did is he got some pixel art photoshopping skills, right?

348
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:48,830
Scott: He is talented.

349
00:21:49,532 --> 00:22:02,710
Scott: so he took all these old screenshots from Famicom games and did something to them and he basically Photoshopped any girls and some guys and some guys and he basically erased shirts and added boobs.

350
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:05,520
Scott: Very like you would think that these were porn games.

351
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,969
Scott: because he did such a good job even animated some of them.

352
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:12,930
Rym: Scarily now Scott showed this to me and I thought it was just a collection of boobs from NES games.

353
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:21,989
Rym: Because they're so good I couldn't tell until I found a game that I recognized and I was like I don't remember the Ninja Turtles gang raping April at the end of that game.

354
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:28,921
Scott: Yeah The thing about this I think it makes a really good Contrast for like some of them moe stuff.

355
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:39,949
Scott: because while this is sort of you know Like it is kind of perverted but it's perverted in a sort of lull way and also, you know It took some artistic pixel art editing skills here.

356
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:47,964
Scott: But it's a pretty good contrast to like the chew bra right where it's like, okay in chew bra You never actually see any nakedness.

357
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:48,890
Scott: It's like they be cut.

358
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:57,253
Scott: They're so perverted and twisted and pedophilic, but they never actually show anything versus this where it's like Okay.

359
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:57,955
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

360
00:22:57,975 --> 00:22:58,818
Scott: We're not pedophiles.

361
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:01,066
Scott: We're just gonna show you, you know actual boobs.

362
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:01,668
Scott: There we go.

363
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:09,263
Rym: Okay It's like Dennis a rat always says The most perverted and crazy people are that way because they can't see the pink.

364
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,135
Rym: just let him see it once or twice and they'll Calm down.

365
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:19,510
Scott: Well, I think what it is right is that When you let you have this person and I've started to maybe this is true or not, right?

366
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:26,530
Scott: Someone is is into something that is so sick, dude, right like pedophilia or something like whoa.

367
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,814
Rym: It's not buggachan.

368
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:28,738
Scott: Yeah, like like.

369
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:31,809
Scott: it's not cool to be into that right, but they're into it.

370
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:36,470
Scott: You can't actually give it to them like you can't actually give them bestiality right or whatever.

371
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:38,418
Rym: I would argue that the internet does.

372
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:47,148
Scott: it does but I'm saying right if you don't you know If you're someone making legitimate stuff and you want to sell it to pedophiles, you can't just sell them.

373
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:48,232
Scott: pet of you know Child porn.

374
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:48,774
Scott: it doesn't work.

375
00:23:49,115 --> 00:23:49,375
Scott: Right?

376
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:50,499
Scott: So what do you do?

377
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,509
Scott: Well, we'll make child porn, but we'll remove.

378
00:23:53,729 --> 00:24:01,090
Rym: well We'll unporn it until it's no longer porn there for just the plot It's the Phantom Edit of what is basically child porn, right?

379
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:06,370
Scott: So it's like well now we can sell this really sick thing by, you know covering up this and covering up that.

380
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,656
Rym: Well, the thing is what's so right?

381
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,680
Scott: where this right?

382
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:13,741
Scott: This is like, oh, well, we're not that sick We're just regular old people who like boobs and whatever.

383
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:15,950
Scott: So we're just gonna show you some sex.

384
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,510
Scott: That's totally normal because we're not sick pedophiles.

385
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,600
Rym: What's interesting just do is the change between it's like.

386
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:26,265
Scott: that is actually better, you know, just being like hey Here's some normal sex right out in the open.

387
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:26,789
Scott: Check it out.

388
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:32,029
Scott: I think that's a lot better than his pedophilia that we covered up So that we don't get arrested.

389
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:41,468
Rym: Well back in the day I remember before I knew about this whole Moe thing and I not even heard the term yet and the first time I saw The term I thought Moe three Stooges.

390
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:46,296
Rym: Yeah, right Someone already made a t-shirt like that so I can't.

391
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:50,710
Rym: that's not an original joke, but basically I remember watching binchotan.

392
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,730
Rym: We all watched it together and it was really really really really Moe.

393
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:58,290
Rym: But we didn't really know about this whole Moe thing.

394
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,343
Rym: And I remember watching it and thinking that was kind of mindless and really really really cute.

395
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:02,745
Rym: and I didn't.

396
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:07,325
Rym: I didn't like cast any Sinister aspersions on it whatsoever at face value.

397
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:08,149
Rym: It is just cute.

398
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:15,569
Rym: and then I learned about the way people like other people would kind of take that anime and the way they would perceive it.

399
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:31,370
Rym: and Suddenly watching it again It felt really really dirty and they went back and watched bottle fairies and it felt really Really dirty and my whole perception of all that stuff changed Because I learned how different people were kind of taking it and what the actual intended audience was.

400
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:39,899
Rym: But then with things like chubra even if you had no idea about Moe five minutes of that shit And you know exactly what is going on?

401
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:40,662
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

402
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:47,855
Rym: it's not like it doesn't even try Nope, so before we forget the meta Moment.

403
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:52,070
Rym: Oh, I remembered it for all of you asking we didn't put up our anime Boston coverage yet.

404
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,515
Rym: It's just not a high priority.

405
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:55,180
Scott: We have anime Boston coverage.

406
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,541
Rym: We cut.

407
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:58,170
Rym: we did an entire like hour-long show about anime Boston.

408
00:25:58,231 --> 00:26:03,400
Rym: I just haven't put it up yet mainly Mainly so you all know because there's not that much to say.

409
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:13,970
Rym: we've been going to anime cons every year many of them since 2002 and Very little notable happens now in current anime cons versus like one from four years ago.

410
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:15,654
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing like.

411
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:19,604
Scott: there's no particular exciting things to report in ways of news.

412
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:21,650
Scott: We did the same panels.

413
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,059
Scott: You know the convention happened.

414
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,063
Scott: It was a convention.

415
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:26,490
Scott: What is you know, that's it.

416
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,116
Rym: The only things to note very briefly.

417
00:26:28,197 --> 00:26:39,150
Rym: there's a sudden rise in high school anime clubs And I think there's going to be a huge anime boom in about four years As soon as all those high school kids get some money.

418
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:46,107
Scott: Yeah You know you don't think they're gonna stop liking anime because I mean it basically I think they're gonna keep liking it because I think There's a lot of people like you look at.

419
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:54,430
Scott: you know Some people like they were in high school and they were totally into mangas and whatever and they were reading them You know back in the Tokyo pop days, but that was during the day when it was shoved down their throats.

420
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:57,560
Scott: But then they got to college and they stopped caring about it.

421
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,125
Scott: They weren't lifelong fans.

422
00:26:59,145 --> 00:27:00,670
Scott: They were just temporary fans.

423
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:08,850
Rym: But look we've gone back to kind of the niche market where the people who are into anime now Aren't the people who saw some on TV and kind of got into it for a while or other friends getting into it?

424
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:14,390
Rym: They're into it because it's just on the internet and it's just next to all the other free entertainment that they watch.

425
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,289
Rym: So they watch like an episode of something and they get into it.

426
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:24,090
Rym: But because it's and it's not accessible in the mainstream push-down-your-throat way it's accessible in the YouTube way.

427
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:27,470
Rym: I think these people are gonna just keep watching it in the YouTube way forever.

428
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:36,441
Rym: But the reason I think there's gonna be a boom is that there's this boom of people joining clubs Maybe and also high school anime clubs were impossible ten years ago.

429
00:27:36,462 --> 00:27:38,026
Rym: Yeah, and suddenly they're everywhere.

430
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:43,244
Rym: Anyway, the I guess the only other thing about anime Boston is the whole second half of that show.

431
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:45,110
Rym: is us complaining about the lack of professionalism?

432
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,116
Scott: The what other metamoments?

433
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:50,926
Scott: the book club book is still Carl Sagan's cosmos.

434
00:27:50,967 --> 00:28:00,969
Scott: We still have to read it Rym, I'm most of the way through it But I'm not gay if I wait and give you my coffee when I'm done Because unlike you I can read a book in like a handful of days.

435
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:09,216
Scott: Not how long you know, you haven't finished it in as since we announced it which was over a month ago You can buy your own goddamn books.

436
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:11,343
Scott: Would you want to do this episode?

437
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:12,908
Scott: We should have been doing it last Thursday.

438
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:15,136
Scott: the episode Yeah, you didn't read it.

439
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,604
Scott: how you never read anything on time.

440
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:17,650
Rym: you didn't read it though either.

441
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:18,312
Scott: It's cuz.

442
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:22,969
Rym: I think you're taking too long, but you realize if you buy it, I'll have it done long before you finish it.

443
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,734
Scott: No, hurry up.

444
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:25,297
Scott: I buy it.

445
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,870
Scott: I'll have it read in like three days and you still won't be done.

446
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,208
Rym: Well, let's see you better buy it first.

447
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,729
Rym: Anyway I've read it before.

448
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:35,538
Scott: So then why are you reading it again?

449
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:37,590
Scott: Cuz I like it is give it to me so I can read it.

450
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,312
Scott: We could do the show.

451
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:39,657
Rym: No, I'm reading it again.

452
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,563
Rym: I'm refreshing my memory.

453
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,554
Scott: So yeah, you're refreshing it very slowly But you couldn't.

454
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:48,512
Scott: you can't even probably to remember what was in the first chapter cuz it was like three months ago that you read It.

455
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:49,407
Scott: cuz you're going so slow.

456
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:54,039
Scott: So if you're gonna buy the book Why should I read it if we have a copy?

457
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,044
Rym: Well, what you mean?

458
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:56,029
Rym: Why should you buy it?

459
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,220
Scott: Anyway, what other metas are there?

460
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:02,290
Scott: we missed a show on Monday.

461
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:15,225
Rym: I had a fancy work thing that I really had some work stuff and by the way work stuff was codename for drinking with all my co-workers and And I don't think there's any more metas.

462
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:16,029
Scott: that's the end of the metas.

463
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,458
Scott: Why do you make it noises even oven a lot?

464
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:19,779
Rym: I don't know.

465
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,525
Scott: All right, no more meta.

466
00:29:21,906 --> 00:29:24,591
Rym: So the mocha Comics.

467
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:25,797
Scott: we're all right.

468
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,378
Scott: We talked about the convention itself Last Wednesday show.

469
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,134
Rym: Yep, but we didn't talk about Individual comics.

470
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:34,059
Rym: at least we put it.

471
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,168
Scott: we put in the interviews of the creators though, right?

472
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,062
Rym: Yes Yeah, at least most of them.

473
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:39,070
Rym: I kind of just threw it up.

474
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:44,474
Rym: You know my tradition for the mocha show is to interview a whole bunch of people and then just string them all together Yep.

475
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:45,966
Scott: Anyway, I was gonna.

476
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:58,310
Scott: I haven't read Most of the ones that I bought pretty much because I was planning to read them today when we decided to do a show on It today, but I was gonna go to the DMV today.

477
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,590
Scott: I thought I was gonna have to take a day off fascinating because the DMV line takes forever.

478
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,727
Scott: So I thought I would need a whole personal day to go to the DMV.

479
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:07,350
Rym: Fascinating and an unknown fact Yep.

480
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:19,068
Scott: But I went to the special License Express DMV which I thought I couldn't go to originally because I thought it was licensed renewal only but apparently is licensed renewal and Plate surrender, which is the two things I needed to do.

481
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:22,841
Scott: The license Express DMV takes like 15 minutes.

482
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:23,845
Scott: It's there's no line.

483
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:24,487
Scott: It's amazing.

484
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:31,129
Scott: So 34th Street license Express if you only need to renew your license, that's a note for everybody in the city.

485
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,677
Rym: So without further ado we're good.

486
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:36,207
Scott: as a result, I was not able to sit home and read comics today.

487
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:36,750
Scott: I went to work.

488
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:37,350
Rym: That's fine.

489
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,950
Rym: We've got a nice collection of the very short or very small or art book kind of things.

490
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:49,160
Rym: We got at the mocha and I want to start right away with the one that you won't find on the internet At least it is not easy to search for.

491
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,390
Rym: it's called crazy lady.

492
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,010
Scott: I don't think there's anything about it on the internet because it was one of those 50 cent ones from the mystery.

493
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:57,580
Rym: So I googled for a crazy lady.

494
00:30:57,802 --> 00:30:59,290
Rym: you find videos of crazy ladies.

495
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:10,819
Rym: Crazy lady in quotes comic book, New York City mocha still turns up primarily an episode of GeekNights for some reason and Videos of crazy ladies yelling on the subway.

496
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:11,662
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:13,608
Scott: Well, I mean, this is from the 50 cent mr.

498
00:31:13,668 --> 00:31:14,170
Scott: T table.

499
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,115
Scott: So it's not.

500
00:31:15,296 --> 00:31:17,748
Rym: they were more than 50 cents unless you put the money in mr.

501
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:17,828
Rym: T.

502
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:29,062
Scott: Yeah the point is is that You know, this wasn't exactly a table that was full of like, you know Relatively high-profile stuff that people cared a lot about.

503
00:31:29,102 --> 00:31:32,279
Scott: it was like, you know, it's like a collective of people Just going like yeah, here's a bunch of stuff.

504
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,266
Scott: God 50 cents.

505
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:33,890
Scott: All right.

506
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:36,734
Scott: So they did you know, they were not.

507
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:42,170
Scott: not all of them were like students with websites and portfolios and that sort of thing.

508
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:43,924
Scott: You know, yeah, it's sad.

509
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:44,730
Rym: I won't read it online.

510
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:53,523
Rym: I don't want to give him spam or anything But the only way we have to track this guy down is that he put his actual email address in the comic Which is at Juneau?

511
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:59,252
Scott: Yeah Juneau was still around me either but I guess if you had one that you know It's still.

512
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:04,496
Rym: but the main reason I want to bring this one up is that it's a testament to the kind like the reason you want To go to the mocha.

513
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,830
Rym: I mean a lot of comics you can just buy on Amazon.

514
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,617
Rym: But this there's no way.

515
00:32:08,657 --> 00:32:11,690
Rym: you would have known about this unless you went to the mocha and bought it.

516
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,920
Scott: There's pretty much no way to get it.

517
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:14,010
Scott: period ever.

518
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:19,908
Scott: It's like it was the only place you wouldn't even known it existed or gotten it in any way shape or form Unless you had been there.

519
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:39,610
Rym: So crazy lady by Chris Brown is a pretty much straight-up just factual nonfiction story of one of those crazy ladies in New York City and many of you might not live in cities, but Basically, there are certain kinds of crazy people who hang out in certain places And if you're in those areas on a regular basis, you will notice them and you will notice their habits.

520
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:44,510
Scott: Yeah, like if you like if you work in say a bodega, right then you would notice.

521
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:49,970
Scott: You know someone who's a crazy lady who sits out, you know, who is around your geographic area.

522
00:32:50,232 --> 00:32:56,346
Scott: They would come around a lot buy a lottery ticket You know, maybe they you just see them walk back and forth all day.

523
00:32:56,386 --> 00:32:58,958
Scott: while you're looking out the window You notice these sorts of things.

524
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:03,150
Scott: We're in like an office building and we're in Apartments that are up off the street.

525
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:11,248
Scott: So we don't really notice you know like specific crazy people that are in a specific area because we're not like sitting there watching them all day.

526
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:15,470
Scott: and If we look out from our balconies, we don't really see crazy people areas.

527
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,850
Scott: But we do notice, you know, we pass by multiple different crazy people as we walk around the street.

528
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:27,350
Scott: So but like for example when I walk to work, I would notice specific crazy people in their specific spots.

529
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:34,417
Scott: You know that they would always be in the same spot every day when I walk to work like the crazy guy who's on the The street with all the Jewish jewelry stores.

530
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,404
Scott: Is that one guy who was over there?

531
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:37,026
Scott: I noticed him.

532
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:40,850
Rym: Uh-huh There aren't the only lady I have and she's actually gone this year.

533
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:49,026
Rym: I don't know where she went was the woman who would stand in front of Grand Central at like 545 678 in the morning just yelling at Grand Central really.

534
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:50,049
Rym: She was really mad at it.

535
00:33:50,892 --> 00:34:00,770
Scott: Wow, but yeah, this is you know, this story really gave me sort of that, you know It's obviously not will Eisner quality in art or in any you know writing or anything.

536
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:06,990
Scott: But the kind of story it is is that will Eisner kind of human story where he tells a story about?

537
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,221
Scott: Humanity that just feels like it's for real.

538
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:12,027
Scott: This is this is people living.

539
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:17,768
Rym: Oh shit Well, at least I know for a fact that it's real because the humanities there are huge manatees.

540
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:20,630
Rym: There are people exactly like this and we see them on a regular basis.

541
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,746
Rym: But I really like this and I'd recommend if you can find it somewhere that you read it.

542
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:25,590
Scott: Yeah, good luck.

543
00:34:26,971 --> 00:34:31,192
Rym: So I guess I'll move right along cuz I have a pile of comics in front of me unless Scott has something I don't know.

544
00:34:31,232 --> 00:34:33,541
Scott: Do you want to talk about the spider one?

545
00:34:33,661 --> 00:34:34,223
Rym: I think we should.

546
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:36,818
Rym: that's not about spiders at all It's about dentists.

547
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:42,965
Rym: Oh, it's about Dennis and dragons and it is basically my of everything I got at the mocha.

548
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:44,029
Rym: It's my favorite thing.

549
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,489
Scott: Really?

550
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,815
Scott: Yeah, I really I think it's just weird.

551
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:50,505
Scott: I mean you basically these dragons, but the dragons are.

552
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:51,327
Rym: well, they're they're not.

553
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,350
Rym: they're sugar dragons.

554
00:34:52,552 --> 00:34:53,850
Scott: Well, no, they're sugar spiders.

555
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,810
Scott: The book basically uses all these wrong names for things like there's some wolves and it's like oh no dentists.

556
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:03,450
Scott: And then when you finally the wolves finally get close they have like Dennis coats and floss.

557
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:04,938
Rym: But that was so.

558
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:11,410
Rym: it was so cool at the end with the whole, you know Making the dentist uniform and then they don't recognize the sugar spider.

559
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:15,210
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, it's basically just sort of like an Adam and Eve story.

560
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:20,590
Scott: You know that the wolf eats the apple and then it it says oh now we can see that you're a sugar spider.

561
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:25,486
Scott: Oh, but we can also see that you have no teeth see and there's no reason to chase you.

562
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:28,430
Rym: and you know I didn't quite take it with the Adam and Eve story.

563
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,072
Rym: I took it more.

564
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:34,649
Rym: is that some sort of like a case or something that is no longer necessary in a world?

565
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:42,367
Rym: I mean the real answer is that it was the brainchild of a comic artist doing the 24-hour comic and thinking about dentists.

566
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,698
Scott: Oh I didn't read the thing in the back.

567
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,370
Rym: Yeah, there's a whole story would have helped.

568
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:54,050
Scott: Yeah, the thing is I think one thing that was interesting was just how they like, you know They draw a dragon but throughout the whole book they keep saying spider.

569
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:56,710
Scott: They never say dragon and they call the dragons like sugar spiders.

570
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:57,514
Scott: So it's like.

571
00:35:57,936 --> 00:36:04,850
Scott: I think that could be an interesting mechanic if you just set up a world Where you just fuck up the names of things, you know, but stay consistent.

572
00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:10,150
Scott: And you know, it's sort of like, you know, I think there's some interesting literary things you can do with that.

573
00:36:10,954 --> 00:36:15,094
Rym: I guess just this was unique and it tied itself together Really really well.

574
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:16,961
Rym: and also the dragons that really good facial expressions.

575
00:36:17,402 --> 00:36:20,492
Scott: Yeah, so and I like the colors are nice the way it's like Watercolor ish.

576
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:31,530
Rym: Yeah, I don't know exactly the color was actually added after the fact that wasn't done in the 24-hour span Okay, but all the rest of it was mm-hmm, but Catan the spider by I R.

577
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:35,722
Scott: Well, that was at this table that all kinds of awesome stuff like bored angel.

578
00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:38,390
Rym: bored angel is literally just a part angel.

579
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:39,938
Scott: Yeah, they also had some other.

580
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:43,797
Scott: I'm pretty sure this was also not a hundred percent sure But I'm pretty sure this is the table that had.

581
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,759
Scott: like these different things that let you build your own story But like spinning stuff around.

582
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:54,605
Scott: they had the book that like you could turn Sections of the book but no matter what combination you came up with the whole page always made sense.

583
00:36:55,207 --> 00:37:06,309
Rym: That was pretty cool Partly - this was just very creative and out there and different But in a good way, actually, I expect I had to do much greater comics as time goes on.

584
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,799
Scott: Yeah, that's something to look for in the future years.

585
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:10,425
Rym: Yeah, I'll make my prediction now.

586
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:11,068
Rym: Mm-hmm.

587
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:16,838
Rym: so I picked up a couple art books and Tiny kitten teeth is something I always forget about.

588
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:19,990
Rym: and then I see the art and I remember like oh, yeah that art.

589
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,295
Scott: Oh, yeah that art.

590
00:37:21,436 --> 00:37:23,584
Scott: Yeah, that looks like totally kitschies 50s 60s stuff.

591
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:27,680
Rym: Yeah, but I I really really really like it.

592
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,350
Rym: So I got the art book Becky dry stat.

593
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,797
Scott: Yeah, it's a webcomic that people read didn't?

594
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:34,319
Scott: they didn't?

595
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:38,170
Rym: she do like a penny arcade once I believe she did one of the lookouts.

596
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:39,194
Scott: Oh, yeah, was that her?

597
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:40,940
Rym: Okay, but I just I don't.

598
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,610
Rym: I really like this style and it was a cool art book.

599
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,010
Rym: It's also something that I haven't seen anywhere but something like the mocha.

600
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,279
Scott: Yeah, I like it because it looks like little golden books, you know At least some of them did and I wasn't.

601
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:52,523
Scott: I like the little golden books.

602
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:54,310
Rym: The comic is surreal.

603
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,110
Scott: Yeah, it is way I mean like what is up.

604
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:04,190
Scott: This is like a squirrel milkman bringing some milk To a tree stump where there's some sort of thing that lives there.

605
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,662
Scott: That's got a mushroom mailbox and at the bottom it says sorry.

606
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:08,164
Scott: I'm late.

607
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:09,388
Scott: I had the wrong stump.

608
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,538
Scott: Okay Alrighty then but the art is like whoa.

609
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,708
Scott: you made that kind of art for that comic.

610
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:18,250
Scott: That's crazy.

611
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:20,542
Scott: I'd like to see like how she does it too.

612
00:38:20,763 --> 00:38:22,050
Scott: Like how do you tell you draw like that?

613
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,391
Scott: Well, I

614
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:34,969
Rym: don't know the characters in the comic like kind of the main plot thread Really remind me of the atmosphere in kevlar and clay when they're in the arty part of the beginning of the book Like when they're just getting into New York Like it's like those kinds of people.

615
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:36,914
Rym: But anyway, I thought it was neat.

616
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:42,602
Rym: the other kind of the exact opposite but also cool was the these shapes art art book shapes The new brethren.

617
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:43,010
Scott: Oh, yeah.

618
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:48,830
Scott: So we heading in the mocha and there's these guys who are just real excited and energetic right and excitable dudes.

619
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:55,010
Scott: They seem like our kind of people and apparently what their story was that when they were in high school or whatever.

620
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:56,155
Scott: I think it was high school.

621
00:38:56,657 --> 00:39:10,169
Scott: one dude who had no who had relatively few art skills Right would draw a shape just outline a solid shape, you know And I just you know alright and the other guy would then take that shape and fill it in with high quality arts of some sort of.

622
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:13,689
Scott: You'd invent a character based on that shape, you know.

623
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:16,358
Scott: Inside the shape around the shape, right.

624
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,573
Scott: and then the first guy who drew the original shape would take it back and then he would name the character that was created.

625
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:31,185
Scott: and they did this a whole bunch of times and they did it so many times that they actually made like A friggin book out of it and they actually saved all these shapes.

626
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,130
Scott: They didn't lose any of them.

627
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:34,199
Scott: so it was totally crazy and awesome.

628
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:38,696
Scott: and the characters that they came up with are like Totally crazy awesome characters.

629
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:44,976
Scott: to like here name some of the guys that my favorite one is still slick chisel the rifle sniffer That's pretty great.

630
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,890
Rym: and ramburger the Chancellor.

631
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,660
Scott: Chancellor we had that's like from a different board game.

632
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:54,535
Rym: Yeah, of course Queen Nadia of Pollination.

633
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:55,510
Scott: Oh snap.

634
00:39:56,551 --> 00:40:03,188
Scott: So yeah, if you go I don't know if these guys have a website or anything, but just like looking at all these faces It's like you could just keep looking at him and it's like I'll do.

635
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:03,449
Scott: lol.

636
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:08,768
Scott: oh look at that one and you look at the original shape and then you look at the face that came out of that shape.

637
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:14,210
Scott: and Sometimes like you look at the shape and you imagine in your brain what character would come from that shape.

638
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:26,190
Scott: right like you imagine like this area being a beard and that being an ear and then you'll look at it and like the ear will Be an eyeball and the beard will be like the nose and that you know, it'll be totally sideways like whoa.

639
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,833
Scott: That guy was really creative.

640
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:30,360
Scott: He did something totally different instead of the obvious thing with it.

641
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,269
Scott: Holy crap, you know pretty cool a lot of fun.

642
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:35,459
Rym: Got anything else over there?

643
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,750
Rym: Should I dip into the rest of my pile?

644
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,252
Scott: I got.

645
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:44,563
Scott: I got only two things left over here because all the comics that I have are at my house and I didn't finish reading Them all and I am NOT at my house right now.

646
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:51,012
Scott: So, let's see There's this tiny one hush by Mara Sternberg.

647
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:56,250
Rym: Oh, that was the one that I expected was going to be very sad and ended up being funny instead.

648
00:40:56,752 --> 00:41:05,019
Scott: Yeah, it was just like on this fancy, you know sort of you know Nice glossy ish paper right very short.

649
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,025
Scott: It's a story about this girl.

650
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:19,770
Scott: She makes a snowman She tells the snowman all her secrets and then something happens and then there's an ending and it's like five pages And it's just one of those like, you know ultra mini comics.

651
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:23,782
Scott: It's only got like three colors like black white and brownish.

652
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,230
Rym: I'd say it's in the same category as bored angel.

653
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:27,716
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

654
00:41:27,857 --> 00:41:39,416
Scott: It's sort of like, you know, you take one joke, but you you know you just put the joke over a few pages and you got yourself a cute little comic that you can sell for a couple bucks at the mocha and It's not bad.

655
00:41:39,436 --> 00:41:51,470
Scott: I'd like to see like this same Artie style but actually do a for real comic that's longer and maybe has a plot, you know as opposed to just one joke And that you know, I think that can be pretty interesting.

656
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,723
Scott: Also the binding with this one string is pretty good.

657
00:41:53,743 --> 00:42:00,650
Scott: binding with the one string I like all the different ways people bind because obviously they did not all take classes in binding at the Center for book arts.

658
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:05,508
Scott: People, you know, some people do like binding and all sorts of different ways from.

659
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:10,725
Scott: you know Just staples to tape to glue to strings to.

660
00:42:11,047 --> 00:42:12,130
Scott: you know, fancy Japanese.

661
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:18,930
Rym: There was no a preponderance plastic ring of straight up well bound like professionally machine bound hardcovers.

662
00:42:19,092 --> 00:42:20,770
Rym: I think there's now a cheap way to do that.

663
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:31,870
Scott: I think this yeah I think there is some way that people have found to get like hardcovers printed because I saw a lot of like Small like 20 to 30 page hardcover type books around with some pretty nice covers on them.

664
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,786
Scott: And I wonder who's doing that and who the printer is and how much it costs.

665
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:42,260
Rym: though I do I want to get the Center for book arts to be at the mocha to do a little table or Me I were they not at the mocha.

666
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,065
Scott: Did we not notice them?

667
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:43,608
Scott: What's up with that?

668
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:43,870
Scott: I don't know.

669
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,253
Rym: I don't know.

670
00:42:44,273 --> 00:42:44,656
Rym: if they know.

671
00:42:44,676 --> 00:42:45,604
Rym: I don't know.

672
00:42:45,825 --> 00:42:46,350
Rym: it amazes me.

673
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:50,490
Scott: How could the Center for book arts not know about the museum for comic and cartoon arts?

674
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,328
Scott: It feels like it should almost be the same museum.

675
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,939
Rym: So Drawn to you was very.

676
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:57,370
Scott: you know, the mocha should have classes.

677
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:06,710
Scott: I mean there is there are places in the city where you get comic classes and writing and art and drawing and all sorts of Stuff, but I think the comic experience I think it might be is the place you can get comic classes.

678
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:08,320
Scott: But it's like why?

679
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,968
Scott: why isn't the mocha given like, you know I think the combination of classes and museum is a good mix that the con the Center for book arts has.

680
00:43:15,048 --> 00:43:17,280
Scott: but like You know did the other museums really?

681
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,890
Scott: I don't think they have so many classes.

682
00:43:19,372 --> 00:43:20,941
Scott: Can you go to the MoMA and get classes?

683
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:21,604
Scott: I don't think so.

684
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,690
Rym: It depends on the museum.

685
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,196
Rym: I mean the Natural History Museum.

686
00:43:24,698 --> 00:43:25,882
Rym: are you know the science museum?

687
00:43:25,902 --> 00:43:27,990
Scott: because I mean the museums are always asked for money, right?

688
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,850
Scott: And I guess the big museums get money from the admissions, right?

689
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:35,110
Scott: Because they can sell admissions or they get the suggested donation and most people do it.

690
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:42,444
Scott: But if you're a smaller museum It's like well you can have Classes to make the money because you can charge a lot for classes and you don't need that.

691
00:43:42,464 --> 00:43:43,990
Rym: many depends on what you are.

692
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:49,441
Scott: Musing I mean If it's I think the correct word the correct verb is curating.

693
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,589
Rym: if it's old kenigits with swords, you're not.

694
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:52,850
Rym: what are you?

695
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:55,349
Rym: Yes, that's a great idea.

696
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:59,801
Scott: Smithing classes duh, I would totally go for some smithing.

697
00:44:00,122 --> 00:44:02,710
Rym: actually that one listener in the forum is talking about his bladesmithing.

698
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:03,175
Rym: He's.

699
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:04,310
Scott: he's pretty awesome with his blades.

700
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:07,424
Rym: I'm not gonna do it because I know but I've known people who have done that.

701
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:09,654
Rym: but for about an hour I was thinking man.

702
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:10,799
Rym: I should totally get into that.

703
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:13,110
Scott: Yeah, you know get a little Forge in the back the balcony.

704
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:14,715
Rym: My neighbors would love that.

705
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,337
Scott: Yeah, right.

706
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:24,810
Rym: Okay, so drawn to you Erica Mon and Lucy Nisley is basically Two girls talking about the fact that they draw penises in some of their comics.

707
00:44:25,072 --> 00:44:26,522
Rym: Not really, but really is that?

708
00:44:26,562 --> 00:44:27,690
Scott: is that really literally in there?

709
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:28,793
Rym: No, it's made kind of.

710
00:44:28,893 --> 00:44:44,002
Rym: it's very just meta about these two comic artists talking about themselves and their lives and their relationships and it's self-indulgent but in a in a very entertaining way and it does end with fraud erism and With them drawing themselves on a unicorn shooting Hitler,

711
00:44:44,624 --> 00:44:46,130
Scott: okay, so, you know, that's the thing with the man.

712
00:44:47,913 --> 00:44:49,360
Rym: Look at this fraud erism right there.

713
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,687
Scott: That's fraud erism.

714
00:44:50,767 --> 00:45:01,440
Scott: All right That's the thing with the mocha is like you'll buy some comics and then like some of them will just be like strangely Like have some weird stuff you did not expect like.

715
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:07,546
Scott: there was this one I bought called hobby and I think it was European or you know Northern European I forget exactly European.

716
00:45:07,586 --> 00:45:08,410
Rym: that might be your hobby.

717
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:15,173
Scott: But I bought it because they had this totally sweet art style that is totally like retro Cool, right?

718
00:45:15,193 --> 00:45:16,278
Scott: That's the only reason I bought it.

719
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:16,981
Scott: It was that's real cool.

720
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:18,167
Rym: to what era like the 50s the 60s?

721
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:19,734
Scott: I can't really.

722
00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:20,478
Scott: I can't really see.

723
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:22,590
Scott: you'd have to show it to you too free to understand.

724
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:33,002
Scott: but basically like I did not expect it to have the contents it had which is pretty much like Frustrated kid never getting it on with anybody story.

725
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,330
Scott: You know, I was like really that's this about whoa.

726
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:40,370
Scott: I thought it would be about like kids playing with messenger toys or something like that.

727
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:42,109
Scott: It totally was not.

728
00:45:43,232 --> 00:45:52,850
Rym: But yeah that happens occasionally at the mocha which is kind of fun the fact that you know You're so used to seeing a certain art style kind of present to you a certain kind of story.

729
00:45:53,171 --> 00:46:00,923
Rym: So whenever an art style doesn't present the story you expect there's this moment of shock and revelation And it really broadens people's horizons.

730
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:02,974
Rym: I mean remember that one Anime.

731
00:46:03,015 --> 00:46:11,307
Rym: when they cry we watch the opening scene, you know, we always used to When we'd watch anime, we'd sit down like me Scott Emily, maybe some other people in.

732
00:46:11,347 --> 00:46:12,190
Scott: that's the Higurashi.

733
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,276
Scott: No, not kokoro knee.

734
00:46:13,457 --> 00:46:14,423
Scott: Yep, and not.

735
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:15,590
Scott: then there's the sequels, right?

736
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,230
Scott: It's like what the fuck are the sequels about?

737
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:25,855
Rym: but we'd watch the first like 10 seconds of a show to see if it was worth watching any more of and if it was Maybe we'd skip through it.

738
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:33,841
Rym: So we start this show and it's just a guy savagely beating someone to death with a baseball bat and We're like, wow kind of show was this?

739
00:46:34,163 --> 00:46:34,726
Scott: that's a kind of.

740
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:35,370
Scott: it's a good show to me.

741
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,929
Rym: I'm kind of violent murder mystery.

742
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,497
Rym: Looks like he just murdered that girl with a baseball bat.

743
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:48,511
Rym: and then the opener happens and it's like the moe is Not moe, but it's just sort of just the happy cute normal that you know It's.

744
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:49,975
Scott: it's very much like Excel.

745
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:55,994
Rym: take the asa manga dial opener and make it more lucky star looking like really cute and just Not what you.

746
00:46:56,316 --> 00:47:01,317
Rym: you did not expect baseball bat murder to be associated with that opener Those character design, but it's not.

747
00:47:01,357 --> 00:47:02,361
Scott: it's not pedophile cute.

748
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:05,595
Scott: It's like regular anime cute, you know I don't know.

749
00:47:05,676 --> 00:47:06,863
Rym: and then the baseball bat murder.

750
00:47:07,104 --> 00:47:08,090
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

751
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:11,275
Rym: So, of course diarrhea diaries 3.

752
00:47:11,275 --> 00:47:13,622
Rym: I think I already talked about that business the finale.

753
00:47:13,903 --> 00:47:14,685
Rym: it is the finale.

754
00:47:14,926 --> 00:47:19,536
Rym: ah shit literally I Read it, but I just have to again.

755
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:24,130
Rym: the parting words of this comic are words to live by you in your life.

756
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:25,000
Rym: Take heed.

757
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:32,043
Rym: in Closing let me leave you with this when a hard winds a-blowin Take heed and realize the storm.

758
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:33,209
Rym: She's a-comin.

759
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:42,350
Rym: Okay, I'm just so glad this guy was able to come to terms with his bow yular escape escapades by sharing them with the masses.

760
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,880
Scott: Yeah, I think diarrhea diaries like a thing like only we know.

761
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,330
Rym: uh, the only other one like that is our prison funnies.

762
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:51,414
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

763
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,140
Rym: I really liked prison funnies.

764
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:55,610
Scott: At least like it seems like some people know Teen Boat, right?

765
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:02,020
Scott: It's like Teen Boat gets around a little bit, you know, but you know Doesn't seem like diarrhea diaries gets around.

766
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,969
Scott: It's like who else is the audience for that besides us?

767
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,031
Scott: I don't know.

768
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:06,858
Rym: So I think we have two more here.

769
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,525
Scott: Okay, we got two more.

770
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:13,526
Scott: Wow this episode kind of short Anyway, so this one Rym gave to me at a read it right before we did the show.

771
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:19,670
Rym: I will say straight up I bought this comic because of the way the giraffe looked on the cover.

772
00:48:20,214 --> 00:48:26,482
Scott: I agree that the way the giraffe looks on the cover It looks like he's the awesomest giraffe and the giraffe is exactly what I expected.

773
00:48:26,522 --> 00:48:29,170
Rym: He's basically Gauri from slayers the giraffe.

774
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,734
Scott: Yeah, so what this is?

775
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:35,870
Scott: it's hero's journey, right and you got this rabbit on the cover with a stick.

776
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:40,710
Scott: He's a he's an anthropomorphized rabbit and behind him is a smiling anthropomorphized awesome giraffe.

777
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,199
Scott: Basically, the story is like totally stereotypical fantasy.

778
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:48,328
Scott: Like I'm a normal dude living in the fantasy times.

779
00:48:48,408 --> 00:48:49,030
Scott: I'm a peasant.

780
00:48:49,832 --> 00:48:53,022
Scott: Oh shit an adventure comes out and bites me in the ass.

781
00:48:53,062 --> 00:48:53,142
Scott: Now.

782
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:54,165
Scott: I gotta go on a quest.

783
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:55,830
Scott: I'm going on a quest.

784
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:57,989
Scott: It's sort of Alice in wonder.

785
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,797
Scott: I'm not Alice in Wonderland Wizard of Oz cuz.

786
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:03,552
Scott: he's meeting all these people on the quest like the giraffe and the pig Right.

787
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:05,620
Rym: Yep, a little bit of slayers feeling but just.

788
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,450
Rym: I think that all harkens back to the root which is stereotypical fantasy.

789
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,233
Scott: I mean slayers.

790
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:12,124
Scott: is Wizard of Oz like to write Lena inverse going on a quest.

791
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:13,850
Scott: Yeah people join the party.

792
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:14,870
Scott: Well join the party.

793
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:20,590
Rym: It's only like Wizard of Oz if the put her as a party could kick everyone's ass anyway, and she murders everyone.

794
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:23,369
Scott: She what's older Wizard of Oz or Lord of the Rings?

795
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,792
Scott: Chirp-chirp cuz like who invented the the?

796
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:29,495
Scott: join the party.

797
00:49:29,515 --> 00:49:30,560
Scott: go on the quest story.

798
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,887
Rym: I'm pretty sure that that existed before both of those.

799
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,272
Scott: Yeah, but it's a who invented it.

800
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:38,007
Scott: I mean the Odyssey was one, dude It wasn't join the party.

801
00:49:38,027 --> 00:49:38,450
Scott: It was just.

802
00:49:38,611 --> 00:49:40,080
Rym: you know, well, he had his party with him.

803
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,216
Scott: Yeah, but it wasn't like the party had like quality characters, you know, it was.

804
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:43,900
Scott: it was a bunch of note.

805
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,125
Scott: You know side.

806
00:49:45,427 --> 00:49:48,320
Rym: I gotta say this Odysseus is a jackass.

807
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,224
Rym: He's cunning, right?

808
00:49:50,244 --> 00:49:53,500
Scott: But even that okay, so here's the thing though, right name one other person in his party.

809
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,460
Scott: There were dudes on the boat cuz they got off when they hit up the Cyclops.

810
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,218
Scott: Yeah, but who was on the boat with him?

811
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:02,800
Rym: The only other awesome people are all the people back home kicking ass, right?

812
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,161
Scott: So there were.

813
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:03,382
Scott: no.

814
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:07,200
Scott: no one else on the boat with him had a name so it wasn't really a join the party situation.

815
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,229
Scott: Yeah, so where was the first quest where people joined the party?

816
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:10,972
Rym: I don't know.

817
00:50:11,192 --> 00:50:11,473
Scott: I don't know.

818
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:21,610
Scott: Anyway, this is a generic story But the giraffe is sort of an awesome character because he's totally swinging not as awesome as King Cosmo And he's not awesome as he is on the cover.

819
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,382
Scott: like on the cover he's way cooler than he is in the book I don't know.

820
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:26,170
Scott: He's still pretty cool as you forget.

821
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,778
Rym: I think when he's dancing in that in.

822
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:30,699
Scott: no That's pretty much as he's shining moment in the Sun.

823
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,028
Scott: But you know, the art is pretty cool.

824
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:37,520
Scott: There's a some misspellings like they misspelled throne.

825
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:39,629
Scott: So it's like here's the.

826
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,080
Scott: I am next in line for the throne really.

827
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:47,740
Scott: So after the next guy is done, you're gonna get you know thrown like a baseball, right?

828
00:50:48,222 --> 00:50:56,286
Rym: Like, you know maybe in Shadowgate right see what I would say is this is again one of those things that you'll only ever find at the mocha and There's a certain charm like.

829
00:50:56,367 --> 00:51:01,236
Rym: obviously this is someone who like one of their earlier like I'm going to make a comic and I'm going to sell it here.

830
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:04,043
Rym: it is and It's passable quality.

831
00:51:04,304 --> 00:51:04,806
Rym: It really is.

832
00:51:04,846 --> 00:51:07,413
Scott: The only thing that bothers me about it is that it's part one.

833
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:09,599
Scott: It's like fuck you part one.

834
00:51:11,021 --> 00:51:17,165
Scott: Now making me buy part two to find out what happens at the end of this incredibly generic Fantasy quest.

835
00:51:17,386 --> 00:51:18,369
Rym: but I really do.

836
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:21,180
Rym: I like I honestly do want to know what happens at the end.

837
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:24,864
Scott: Stereotypical story.

838
00:51:24,945 --> 00:51:28,221
Scott: one thing it does but then I cut you off and it's like fuck you Thank.

839
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:34,020
Scott: is this gonna continue to be stereotypical in every way shape and form and have a happy ending or maybe not?

840
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:36,307
Rym: I don't very few fantasy things.

841
00:51:36,387 --> 00:52:00,287
Rym: I have read cut to the meat of what the heroes expect, you know in this It's the hero meets a dryad and wants to savor and I've read a lot of other fantasy stores with a similar vibe, but He pretty much straight-up just fantasizes about saving her and then totally making out with her Which is what is on the mind of every hero, but very few fantasy works kind of get right into that Like they don't make it obvious to you.

842
00:52:00,648 --> 00:52:00,929
Rym: Yes.

843
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,076
Rym: He totally just wants to bone the princess.

844
00:52:03,096 --> 00:52:04,019
Rym: That's why he's doing this.

845
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:07,149
Scott: He isn't doing it just because he wants to bone her.

846
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:09,038
Scott: He wants to save her and bone her.

847
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:16,260
Scott: You know if he saved her and didn't bone her he would be happier than if he failed to bone and failed to see.

848
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,123
Rym: Bonder didn't.

849
00:52:17,164 --> 00:52:19,413
Rym: savor would be the bad guy right exactly.

850
00:52:19,434 --> 00:52:20,920
Scott: He definitely does not want to do that either.

851
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,565
Scott: I don't think cuz.

852
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:23,420
Scott: then she would be dead and it would be necrophilia.

853
00:52:23,801 --> 00:52:29,980
Scott: But it would be necrodendrophilia because she's a dryad, but she was originally like a water nymph mermaid.

854
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:32,480
Scott: So would it be aqua dendrite necrophilia?

855
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:39,040
Rym: So The last comic I would like to talk about Scott didn't read this.

856
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,422
Rym: I don't believe.

857
00:52:39,442 --> 00:52:42,879
Scott: I wonder if anyone else in the entire history of the universe is said aqua dendrite necrophilia.

858
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:44,587
Rym: I gotta google it.

859
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:46,280
Scott: I will do it right now.

860
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:53,892
Rym: so while you do that the last comic I have here is mirror mine by Tori woolcott and There have been a lot of these comics lately and I think they're a good thing.

861
00:52:53,973 --> 00:53:02,440
Rym: and this one's really well done a very sparse Like thick hard lines black and white style and it's the story of a girl who has dyslexia and kind of what that's like.

862
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,717
Rym: And apparently it portrays it so well and you're reading it.

863
00:53:06,737 --> 00:53:07,748
Rym: It was very enjoyable I liked.

864
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:14,139
Rym: it's worth reading That a lot of schools and a lot of counselors are actually using this book to help kids who actually have dyslexia.

865
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:14,944
Rym: Deal with it.

866
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:15,850
Scott: That's pretty cool.

867
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:24,600
Rym: And it kind of the book all backwards No, but it has a really good section where it shows like why dyslexics specifically like why they have trouble.

868
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:26,226
Scott: That's sort of like those things where it's like.

869
00:53:26,266 --> 00:53:33,480
Scott: this is what it looks like to a colorblind person, you know to help, you know Normal non-disabled people see what it's like to be disabled.

870
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:36,260
Scott: I remember when I was a kid like here sit in a wheelchair for a day.

871
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,838
Scott: We're gonna tie your legs to the chair so you can't use them off.

872
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:40,088
Scott: now I see how horrible.

873
00:53:40,128 --> 00:53:40,269
Scott: there

874
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:48,720
Rym: was an exhibit of like different disabilities at a science museum in Detroit and they made a whole city street with an intersection and everything all indoors full-size

875
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:49,823
Scott: Mmm,

876
00:53:49,843 --> 00:53:54,940
Rym: and you'd put on a blindfold and try to navigate it in any capacity with a blind walking stick

877
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:57,390
Scott: And then they showed your video of you walking around actually.

878
00:53:57,431 --> 00:53:57,651
Rym: Yeah.

879
00:53:57,973 --> 00:53:59,620
Rym: Yeah, you know what not easy.

880
00:53:59,889 --> 00:54:05,752
Scott: No My search result is done Apparently an urban dictionary.

881
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:12,660
Scott: There is an entry For dendro necrophiliac and it says one who perform sexual intercourse with dead trees.

882
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:14,608
Rym: But there is no wouldn't that just a doubt?

883
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,280
Scott: a wooden dildo, but there is nothing.

884
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:21,900
Scott: Let's see if they have aqua filiac, but they don't have aqua dendro All right.

885
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,183
Scott: So they have.

886
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:28,657
Scott: aqua filia is on Wikipedia Which is a form of sexual fetishism which involves people swimming or posing underwater.

Scott: Yeah, totally like hot mermaid chicks, but they have nothing.

889
00:54:34,281 --> 00:54:40,558
Scott: Nothing about aqua dendro necrophilia, which would I suppose it'd be dead trees in the water after they went through the sawmill.

890
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:44,178
Rym: well There's a horrifying image from you for you.

Rym: I don't know how many of our listeners will get it But so you want to have sex with horrifying dead trees in the water?

892
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:55,355
Rym: I recall in the life and times of Scrooge McDuck a specific kind of tree like that.

893
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,157
Rym: No shit.

894
00:54:56,298 --> 00:55:01,193
Scott: Yeah Well, actually I'm watching Captain Harlock where he's fighting against the Mazzone.

00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:08,340
Scott: the evil plant aliens right from outer space And there's at one point where there is some seaweed Mazzone and those seaweed Mazzone totally get killed.

896
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,874
Scott: So is that another aqua dendro necrophilia situation?

897
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,500
Scott: Cuz all Mazzone are totally hot.

898
00:55:14,384 --> 00:55:17,096
Scott: They look like totally hot ladies, even though they are all plant people.

00:55:17,156 --> 00:55:20,115
Rym: So they're like space Guess I don't know.

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,760
Rym: Wait till you finally get a hold of that old second ed D&D monster man.

Scott: I mean, there's like what isn't time.

906
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,111

Rym: deal with kelpie.

910
00:55:53,045 --> 00:56:01,719
Rym: as I recall it kind of points out the fact that if you wear like say a ring of underwater Breathing it really can't kill you and you can just enjoy yourself.

911
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,806
Scott: Yeah, yeah It's I like parts.
