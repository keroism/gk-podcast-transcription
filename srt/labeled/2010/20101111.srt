1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,789
Rym: It's Thursday 11 11 2010.

2
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:16,959
Rym: I'm Rym And this is GeekNights tonight protest rallies and riots.

3
00:00:24,402 --> 00:00:25,133
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,240
Scott: Is it anything like a mistress?

5
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:31,125
Rym: What do you want?

6
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:33,380
Rym: It's armistice day 11 11 2010.

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,143
Rym: I like.

8
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:38,336
Scott: I like how you redid the the you you stopped recording so that you got correct.

9
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:44,093
Rym: your mistake of saying Our mistress incorrectly or didn't record as you can look at right now.

10
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:47,123
Rym: I said wait I have to restart it Uh-huh.

11
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:48,007
Scott: Yeah, cuz you didn't.

12
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:49,413
Scott: you're bad at pronouncing.

13
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:52,822
Scott: You're covering up your errors Okay.

14
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:54,448
Rym: Anyway, it is armistice day.

15
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:58,160
Scott: All right, so yeah exciting thrilling.

16
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:02,437
Scott: Wow, that's a that's an exciting start to the show there.

17
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:04,488
Scott: so Anything else going on?

18
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:09,833
Rym: Hey, I don't know you give me all this crap about saying the date and yet No one seems to have complained about the fact that I say the date in the opening.

19
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,139
Rym: you're so about it.

20
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,109
Scott: No one's even commented either way.

21
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:14,354
Scott: Yeah, who knows what they think?

22
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,500
Rym: I Think we should leave the date in and I'm gonna keep doing it.

23
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:22,198
Rym: You sounded so just Like I'm Rym.

24
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:26,093
Scott: Why can't you just say the date the way we've been saying it?

25
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:27,259
Scott: Why you gotta mess things up?

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:27,961
Rym: Why don't you?

27
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:29,509
Scott: just does name wasn't broken?

28
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,640
Rym: Why don't you just keep slaves like we've been doing?

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,625
Rym: Why do you guys set them free?

30
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:33,853
Rym: All right, got a change.

31
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:34,859
Rym: We got a progress.

32
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:37,069
Scott: Yeah, but if it ain't broke don't fix it.

33
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:40,162
Scott: you got to change what's broke but not what's not broke and I think it was Broke.

34
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:40,604
Rym: we didn't.

35
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:43,800
Scott: it was not broke not only as single person complained.

36
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,393
Scott: No, not a single person.

37
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:46,240
Scott: is that a problem with it?

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,874
Rym: So we should only fix things that people complain about even if they're wrong.

39
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:51,400
Scott: No, you should only fix things that are broken.

40
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:55,391
Rym: I mean 20 of the 2000 bug, you know, why 2k?

41
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:56,836
Rym: we know it was broken.

42
00:01:57,257 --> 00:02:01,551
Rym: actually in a lot of places It wasn't but we had to check But it was actual breakage.

43
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:05,567
Rym: This is not breakage But we didn't handle the date rollover.

44
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:07,814
Scott: you're fixing a problem that does not even exist.

45
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,339
Rym: the fact that we didn't handle the date rollover.

46
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:12,460
Scott: No, the fact that would saying the date at the beginning of the show.

47
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,080
Scott: We don't even need to say the day to being a show we just leave it out entirely.

48
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,943
Scott: It wouldn't make a difference.

49
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,775
Rym: So we just not do the show would make a difference.

50
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:22,140
Rym: It's also true God.

51
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,191
Scott: So considering how inconsequential it is.

52
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:30,792
Rym: There's no reason to change But considering how inconsequential it is There's no reason to resist the change.

53
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:31,900
Rym: that doesn't cost you anything.

54
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:32,483
Scott: It does good.

55
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:33,025
Scott: I just think it.

56
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:33,669
Scott: I think it's worse.

57
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:34,673
Scott: It lowers the quality.

58
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,020
Rym: I think that's silly.

59
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:37,222
Scott: You know what?

60
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:41,280
Scott: I think it's silly spending the whole beginning of the show arguing about how we say the date in the show.

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,298
Rym: You're the one who started it.

62
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:48,437
Rym: Anyway, it's Thursday.

63
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:51,605
Rym: So, I guess zombies.

64
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:54,275
Rym: I mean isn't that the Thursday show we're gonna do?

65
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:55,540
Scott: no, we're never doing that show.

66
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:59,635
Rym: I don't understand why people to this day demand we do a zombie show.

67
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:10,832
Scott: We did that first zombie show in 2006 the same shallow people who will go to the comic book store and they'll buy anything with a zombie on it and they'll go See any movie where the zombie in it and they'll watch any TV show.

68
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,860
Rym: Why don't we farm out a zombie podcast?

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,220
Scott: Zombies if they go to if they want to buy anything, right?

70
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,830
Scott: They want to go to the store and buy a screwdriver.

71
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,919
Scott: if one of them has a zombie on the package They'll buy that one.

72
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:26,423
Rym: I gotta admit if I was buying a screwdriver and there were zombie brand and like normal brand and the zombie brand didn't Cause that much more.

73
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:31,600
Scott: I would evaluate the actual screwdriver in question based on price and quality.

74
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,300
Rym: Screwdrivers are pretty much all the same now.

75
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:42,367
Scott: They're made of different materials and the different sizes and some of them are stronger and weaker and for 90% of people It doesn't matter it matters.

76
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:43,372
Rym: Not really it does.

77
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:45,260
Rym: I have the cheapest ass screwdriver.

78
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,780
Scott: Yeah, I see a magnetic non magnetic.

79
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,389
Scott: Yeah, you know what handles there's grip.

80
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,416
Rym: There's no reason to not get magnetic.

81
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:53,620
Rym: magnetic doesn't hurt anything.

82
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:57,280
Scott: But there is occasionally a reason not to get magnetic.

83
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,084
Rym: Yeah, but rarely.

84
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,380
Rym: I mean a lot of people think that they shouldn't use them into their computer.

85
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,440
Rym: But that's not hurting anything.

86
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:03,943
Scott: No But it could be a problem.

87
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:09,660
Scott: say you're screwing something into something in this metal filings about that suddenly got metal filings over your screwdriver.

88
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,588
Rym: It's like ah fuck and then you just wipe them off.

89
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:14,500
Rym: I think the deeper problem there is why are you screwing into something?

90
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,858
Rym: That's covered in metal filings.

91
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:19,874
Scott: Maybe you're screwing into something that's metal and the filings are coming out because you're screwing.

92
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:21,579
Rym: then you're not screwing you're drilling.

93
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,331
Scott: What if it's already semi drilled?

94
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:26,060
Scott: but you're you know the tight fit.

95
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,995
Scott: Good guy, what do we know about screwing and drilling here?

96
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:39,956
Rym: quite a bit in fact If you can tell we couldn't figure out what to do the fucking show on.

97
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,819
Scott: no, not at all Let's do some news.

98
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:52,010
Rym: I do want to get out of this rut a little bit about this article because it's been making the rounds and internet people are talking about it and Everyone that I've seen so far is missing the base point.

99
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:58,460
Scott: the AP was reporting that that's because the AP writes something and everyone else writes the exact same thing with different language.

100
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:03,599
Scott: They just get the thesaurus and they put up a mark But even in comments in places people just don't get it.

101
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,435
Rym: So there was the study that showed that there's a strong correlation.

102
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:18,000
Rym: now, obviously, there's no causation proof of causation But there's a strong correlation between people who text frequently and use Facebook Well and or use Facebook.

103
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:22,762
Rym: this is correlated strongly with drug use and Sex.

104
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:34,459
Scott: Well, gee, if you are the kind of person who has more friends You're the kind of person who has people to text and Facebook with and as a result people to have sex and drugs.

105
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:39,980
Scott: with Drug, I mean sex is pretty much Explicitly a you know friend.

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,260
Scott: Multi-person activity and drugs are usually not too many people do drugs alone.

107
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,492
Rym: Yep, two two to four players four hours.

108
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:50,740
Scott: I mean try to imagine in your head stoners.

109
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,171
Scott: You don't think of a stoner in his room alone with weed.

110
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:56,760
Scott: you think of a bunch of people passing the bong around.

111
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:57,905
Scott: You know that right?

112
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:58,528
Scott: It's not a.

113
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,920
Rym: well, there is the stoner who's alone in this room.

114
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:01,587
Scott: That's a rare.

115
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,640
Scott: you don't think about that though.

116
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,624
Rym: Is that guy rare?

117
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:06,716
Rym: that guy is the same as the alcoholic who is also alone in his room.

118
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:13,020
Scott: someone who is lonely Is a lot less likely to do drugs and or an extremely unlikely to have sex.

119
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,964
Scott: so What's with the captain?

120
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:16,385
Scott: obvious,

121
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:27,529
Rym: but I think although especially in the mainstream news a lot of the commentary about it This has been really weird and they're trying to either say there's some sort of correlation between using this Social technology and being a deviant or whatever

122
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:29,436
Scott: about the correlation with having lots of friends.

123
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:30,360
Rym: I think it's even simpler.

124
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:38,932
Rym: I think it's a correlation with being young and the fact that society has been progressively more and more open liberal and generally cool with stuff.

125
00:06:39,233 --> 00:07:03,439
Rym: as time has gone on and The generations coming up now, I mean when I was in high school for all the talk kids had about yeah I had sex and how worldly they pretended to be Not many of them were actually having sex or even they making out with each other and that became quite apparent when Someone I know had sex and suddenly all these very worldly people were very I don't know.

126
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:10,379
Rym: It was obvious that they had no idea what they were talking about And I think if I was in high school today, it's blowjobs aplenty.

127
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:18,096
Rym: I Get this impression and I think that the simple correlation causation here isn't even social.

128
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,460
Rym: people are more likely to have sex.

129
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,176
Rym: I think it's just the generation coming up is way more liberal.

130
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,020
Rym: on average.

131
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:28,273
Rym: I'm just about everything and if you're young you're more likely to use new technology.

132
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,360
Scott: You're just saying it's the times right?

133
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:43,500
Scott: Yeah, like hey in 2010 Kids are more likely to have sex and also in 2010 kids are more likely to use Facebook because Both of those things are on the rise that happen to be on the rise at the same time.

134
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:53,687
Rym: so in fact I would argue that the kids who don't send a lot of text or don't use a lot of Facebook are the kids who are Actually already behind the times Or ahead of way ahead of the times.

135
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,844
Rym: I'm not getting the sense that they're way ahead of the times But you don't know.

136
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:58,809
Scott: the times could revert.

137
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,179
Scott: it could be a sine wave go back and forth.

138
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:05,243
Rym: Thing is it never really has except for the Dark Ages I don't know.

139
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:15,419
Scott: I mean, you know, you look at something like the Victorian era right where everything was on the surface all very, you know modest but underneath much more lewd.

140
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:22,080
Scott: In reality, it was the ludest and then it was only after it that it actually got a little bit less lewd.

141
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:25,622
Scott: But there's always lewdness somewhere Everywhere.

142
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:32,506
Rym: I mean, I think this study can really just be summed up as kids who use technology are smarter and more social and more Likely to do fun things.

143
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,900
Scott: Yeah, it's due to I don't know whatever.

144
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:42,200
Scott: So I also read about this article about a study, of course You know, you never get the actual study and everything's always full of bullshit.

145
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:45,113
Rym: I got the actual study here, but it wasn't that exciting.

146
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:46,640
Scott: Oh, wow, very cool.

147
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:51,800
Scott: But anyway, this article has also made the similar rounds and it's typical science reporting.

148
00:08:51,860 --> 00:09:05,256
Scott: But anyway, what it's about is it says spacing out half the day makes people unhappy in Harvard study and they're basically saying look People especially when they're at work their minds wander about forty six point nine percent of the time.

149
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:06,560
Rym: Ah, it's about right.

150
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:13,119
Scott: I'm mostly just kind of walking around looking around thinking about stuff and no less than thirty percent of the time during every activity except sex.

151
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:23,307
Scott: And apparently people who are able to focus on one thing for a long amount of time as opposed to having their mind wander are happier.

152
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:27,411
Scott: and it's like Here's another situation where it's like hello.

153
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:33,112
Scott: obviously, it's not the mind Wandering that is causing the effect of being bored.

154
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,255
Scott: It's their board.

155
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:35,780
Scott: They're unhappy because they're bored.

156
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,760
Scott: So when they got nothing to do their mind wanders if they had something to do or if they have this on that shit.

157
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,966
Rym: Or like my situation at work.

158
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:42,871
Rym: I have stuff to do.

159
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,600
Rym: It's just boring.

160
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:46,346
Scott: I'm in the same situation.

161
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:48,614
Scott: I don't want my mind to wander at work.

162
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,380
Scott: It wanders cuz there's nothing doing.

163
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:51,263
Rym: There's a reason.

164
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:55,658
Rym: I'm reading C sharp and XNA books and and cuz I'm bored and I want to learn.

165
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:57,063
Rym: I don't want to just And I can't.

166
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:01,256
Scott: I would do my own thing in my free time at work, but I can't.

167
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:02,360
Scott: cuz then they own that shit.

168
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,525
Scott: Yeah, I was at home.

169
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:05,273
Scott: I could get away with it cuz they would never know.

170
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:10,008
Scott: but at the same time I can't just be at home all the time.

171
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,140
Rym: My mind really only waters when I'm bored.

172
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:26,479
Scott: Yeah I mean if there are some days Rarely once maybe a couple times a month if I'm lucky where there's actually something to do and Focus on for the whole day because most days I could just do all my work in like ten minutes not be it.

173
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:27,912
Scott: You know, it's cuz it's so easy.

174
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:34,060
Rym: Sometimes I will pointedly daydream like I'll be like, I'm just gonna sit here and dick around.

175
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,770
Scott: Yes, but it's just like I'm not.

176
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:41,310
Scott: you know, it doesn't make me unhappy But you know that my mind is wandering.

177
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,980
Scott: my mind wandering is it's the other way around.

178
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,880
Rym: Whoa, whoa, go I want to go back to my study for a second.

179
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,808
Rym: You know what they define as a frequent texter.

180
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:52,302
Rym: All right more than a hundred and twenty a day Okay.

181
00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:55,458
Rym: Yeah, cuz basically, you know kids they use it the way we used aim.

182
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:59,277
Scott: Yeah kids these days if you got friends, they have a you know, they have text.

183
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:01,105
Scott: They don't use aim They just use text messages.

184
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:02,853
Scott: They have their phones with them all day.

185
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:06,565
Scott: And if you're not in a class with They're bored.

186
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:09,660
Scott: They're not paying attention in class because they're fucking bored other minds.

187
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,160
Scott: So they just talk to people all day because you can't do anything else.

188
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,240
Rym: They're existing in this kind of meta universe where they're not bored.

189
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,882
Rym: Their mind is.

190
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:22,280
Rym: think of this in that study, right people's minds are wandering, but it's daydreaming like I'm bored thinking about potatoes.

191
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:30,419
Scott: Yeah I mean if you're the kind of person who has a friend that is gonna text you 160 times a day Then you probably have or even have enough friends to add up to that.

192
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:43,857
Scott: Then these people actually want to talk to you which means they're actually your friends and you access that to talk about with them Which means you have a lot of friends means you're very likely Person who gets along with people and that's very likely to have sex with someone.

193
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:47,617
Scott: and also if you're into drugs There'll be people to have drugs with.

194
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:50,630
Rym: But here's my point in that study.

195
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,640
Rym: people's minds wander within their own mind.

196
00:11:52,941 --> 00:11:55,720
Rym: They're bored and their mind is just kind of thinking about potatoes.

197
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:59,794
Rym: Yeah These kids see potatoes their mind is literally.

198
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:02,529
Rym: well it is in a way Wandering as in they're.

199
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:08,060
Rym: they're physically in a place They're in class somewhere or they're like on the bus or their mom's talking to him or something.

200
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:16,060
Rym: But really their mind is out in this shared space with all the other people They're texting their mind is literally wandered and they're probably happier.

201
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:21,437
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is, you know, when I mind wanders at work, it's wandering on the internet, right?

202
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:22,440
Scott: It's not wandering.

203
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:25,891
Rym: Sometimes I can't wander on the internet or I've wandered everywhere.

204
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:27,014
Rym: interesting to wander.

205
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:27,736
Rym: That's usually.

206
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:30,389
Scott: my problem is I Wandered the whole internet.

207
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,511
Rym: Yeah when I worked at that old job in the hospital I remember there were days where all right.

208
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,817
Rym: I've read everything on Fark Nothing else to do.

209
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,243
Rym: Should they buy?

210
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:47,125
Scott: Tony really just need some sort of way for you know people to I you know to You know to take.

211
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,269
Scott: hey, I did all my work.

212
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,440
Scott: You must let me leave or give me more work immediately.

213
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,120
Rym: Ah, but here's the problem.

214
00:12:53,601 --> 00:13:00,300
Rym: What if their resolution to that is to give you stupid work that is time-consuming that is unnecessary work.

215
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:04,380
Scott: Example as a software engineer I can automate all work.

216
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,674
Scott: There is no work they could give me that I could not automate.

217
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:18,077
Rym: I worked as Perhaps the worst pizza chef in the history of RIT at the Ritz in the bar downstairs yep, and I was the worst pizza chef because they paid me so little that I literally just didn't care.

218
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:25,233
Rym: and once I made a good pizza and they yelled at me because I used too many ingredients and I was like All right, fine back to shitty pizza.

219
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:34,791
Rym: I go but Anytime I was not actively making pizza or throwing away the pizza that no one bought because it was shady to replace it with new Shitty pizza that no one would buy.

220
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:35,920
Scott: you're just standing there.

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,128
Rym: I was just standing there and my manager.

222
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:43,078
Rym: one day I came up and she was like if you got time to lean You got time to clean.

223
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,931
Scott: But it's like we already just cleaned everything.

224
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:46,815
Rym: and I was.

225
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,060
Rym: I was leaning against the fridge.

226
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,805
Rym: So what you know what I did.

227
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:50,859
Rym: I stopped leaning and I stood there.

228
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,409
Rym: Okay, and she was like clean something.

229
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,176
Rym: I cleaned goddamn everything.

230
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:59,130
Rym: I was so bored I pulled back like the fridge and cleaned behind that shit.

231
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,040
Rym: All right, and then I leaned and she said it again and I quit.

232
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:06,266
Rym: That's how I quit the Ritz.

233
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:09,300
Rym: she was like if you got time to lean you got time to clean like a month later.

234
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:10,577
Rym: And I was like, you know what I quit.

235
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:13,853
Rym: And she was like what I was like, yeah, I quit.

236
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:14,920
Rym: I'm done.

237
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:16,224
Scott: It seems like people.

238
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:20,217
Scott: it's like whenever you have a job people act like, you know, you need that job.

239
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:23,723
Scott: Yeah Another job.

240
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,520
Scott: there's never been a time in my life where I could not get a job within a few days.

241
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:34,800
Rym: I think a lot of you cannot threaten me with fire either do need their jobs or They don't realize how easy it is to get another job.

242
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,639
Scott: If you are maybe really want it's hard for them to get a job because they have no skills.

243
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:40,706
Rym: No, all righty kids.

244
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:42,973
Rym: It's trivial to get a job somewhere in Rochester.

245
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:45,060
Rym: It's just people don't know how to look for a job.

246
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:54,720
Rym: They apply to like the obvious jobs like the local fast food or the on-campus jobs And they don't even think about applying to like the factory nearby to be like a maintenance guy at night.

247
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:59,328
Scott: Yeah, no one you know, that's that's a big problem is in the whole world Is it these non obvious jobs?

248
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,080
Scott: and no no career counselors, right?

249
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:12,570
Scott: You know, I would be a career counselor if it paid better because I would I would actually be able to find people you know the careers they wouldn't even think about like somebody underwater.

250
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:19,450
Rym: welder obviously Racer Mm-hmm f1 driver you can go for that.

251
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:20,836
Rym: You could race car driver things.

252
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:24,460
Rym: You got to start early on that Yeah, but if you got to go to elementary kids school kids and be like, you know what?

253
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:25,304
Scott: Right.

254
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:26,047
Scott: Here's a praise.

255
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:26,850
Scott: That's a good job, right?

256
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,875
Scott: So f1 driver.

257
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:29,160
Scott: That's a hard job to get right?

258
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,750
Scott: But you could be the pit crew guy.

259
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:33,448
Scott: Yeah, you could be the mechanic guy You could be the.

260
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,984
Scott: you could make racing helmets You can.

261
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,260
Scott: you could be the guy who's in charge of getting sponsorships for the cars.

262
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:43,660
Scott: You could be the race steward the guy who runs out with the fire extinguisher.

263
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,550
Scott: There's like a million jobs just in that one Small area that no one even thinks about.

264
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,711
Scott: you know one grows up says I'm gonna be a race steward I'm gonna be there who weighs the checkered flag.

265
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:55,200
Scott: No one thinks they're gonna be that guy.

266
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,222
Rym: Yeah, but I'd love as a kid if someone had said hey, but that's actually a really that guy That's a beat.

267
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:00,229
Scott: It's a damn good job.

268
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:01,699
Rym: You want to go for that go for it?

269
00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:03,769
Scott: Go all around the world.

270
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:17,038
Rym: when I was a freshman in high school there was one of those, you know, what career you're gonna have aptitude tests like what careers you good at and I took it and Based on everything basically gave everyone else in my class like 10 or 15 options.

271
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:21,359
Rym: It literally gave me one option which was it said?

272
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,968
Rym: Market data analyst you're getting close.

273
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,259
Rym: Yeah, and I thought fuck that I'm going into computers.

274
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:40,026
Scott: and Well, you know I I never took one of those things but I always heard saw jokes about them and they were on TV shows And stuff, you know, there'd always be.

275
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:43,000
Scott: every sitcom would have an episode about them if there were kids in school.

276
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,697
Rym: And yeah, it tells the one kid he's gonna be a janitor and he's upset about it.

277
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:50,150
Scott: Yeah But yeah, I never took one of those.

278
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:50,753
Scott: but that's weird.

279
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:51,576
Scott: that what it would be.

280
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:58,830
Scott: so, you know accurate I guess you know if even if it's random it's gonna be scarily correct on some people and incorrect on most people.

281
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:10,496
Rym: but also if you're young and skilled generally like you have basic human skills and you live anywhere where there's a reasonable density of Population in a city it is trivial to get to.

282
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,377
Rym: even in a suburb it is actually pretty trivial to get a job that'll pay you enough to live.

283
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:17,304
Rym: and It it amazes me.

284
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:27,132
Rym: there were people I knew who couldn't like a job they hated and they never like realized they could quit and I always felt like I should have been the hero.

285
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:32,837
Rym: like that one college humor with the guy Who plays the spags are through stir stands up on the table rips off his shirt.

286
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:38,859
Rym: He's duct-taped I quit to his chest and runs around like screaming and quitting and eventually the cops get called.

287
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:43,400
Rym: But no when I remember when I worked at the Bellas one day they called me in the morning.

288
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,004
Rym: They're like Rym.

289
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:47,103
Rym: You didn't show up to work and I was like, yeah I guess I didn't.

290
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,779
Rym: and then the guy pauses and he's like are you ever gonna show up again?

291
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:51,548
Rym: Cuz he knew.

292
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:54,092
Rym: and I was like You know what?

293
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:56,135
Rym: Nah I'm done.

294
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:00,811
Rym: Or the Ritz I quit I'm done like this or the hospital.

295
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:03,500
Rym: Yeah, I was kind of hoping to be out of here by lunchtime.

296
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:10,480
Scott: The thing is when I was younger I always looked at people who couldn't stay with one job, but I'd like why can't you stay with one job?

297
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,084
Scott: What's wrong with you?

298
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:20,118
Rym: I this is the longest job I've ever held already Three years and I knew people at IBM who'd worked at IBM for 40 years.

299
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:23,439
Scott: What the fuck my life not even 40 years old.

300
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:34,280
Rym: So things of the day, I like otters.

301
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,183
Rym: I like cute otters.

302
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:37,190
Rym: I like cute baby otters being taught how to swim.

303
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,699
Rym: The babies they kind of know.

304
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,830
Scott: but basically the way like a fucking giraffe comes out and starts walking like right away.

305
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:46,197
Rym: Yeah, what an otter.

306
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:47,465
Scott: come out and swim right away.

307
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,274
Rym: otters walk right away But when their babies?

308
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:55,060
Rym: basically I've watched videos of this what otter moms do is one day They're like you're ready and they pick them up in the neck.

309
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,730
Scott: Aren't they born in the water now?

310
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:03,890
Rym: Okay, cuz they're basically like water land like dogs Like they go between the land and the water and act like dogs that they like to play with rocks.

311
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,529
Rym: So one day the mom otters like they don't play they don't pick up rocks in their hands like they catch with them.

312
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:13,650
Rym: So one day the otter mom's like, all right fuckers time to learn how to swim.

313
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,530
Rym: We shall pick them up throw them in the water.

314
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,598
Scott: Yeah, that's how you do it.

315
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:18,210
Rym: and they're like, yeah and they try to get out.

316
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,589
Rym: She picks them up and throws them back in the water until they figure it out.

317
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:27,304
Rym: So this is a human doing that because the otters don't have mommies or something is really cute.

318
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:30,294
Scott: take note people with human babies Same thing works.

319
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:31,720
Scott: Don't be afraid to do it.

320
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,723
Scott: You're standing right there.

321
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:34,129
Scott: if they start drowning you pick them up.

322
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:36,160
Scott: It's not gonna be the end of the world, right?

323
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:39,724
Rym: That's how I Learned how to sled and ski.

324
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:40,430
Rym: to a degree.

325
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,147
Rym: I got one lesson and then I was basically pushed down the mountain.

326
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:44,750
Rym: in both cases.

327
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,982
Scott: Yeah, it's you know, people are so afraid like I was so cruel.

328
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:49,870
Scott: It's like yeah, the kid might be upset.

329
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:50,575
Rym: You know how.

330
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:52,550
Scott: I learned how to getting upset never hurt anybody.

331
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:54,826
Scott: I learned how to solder as long as you don't drown.

332
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:55,329
Scott: It's all good.

333
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,963
Rym: I learned how to solder by fucking burning my fingernail off.

334
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:59,249
Scott: I had an Australian guy tell me.

335
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,343
Rym: I learned how to wire by shocking the shit out of myself.

336
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:03,970
Rym: All right, I learned about fireworks.

337
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,741
Rym: I hit myself in the face with a bottle rocket.

338
00:20:05,962 --> 00:20:07,190
Scott: So check it out this one, dude.

339
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:17,291
Scott: He went and he took you know Megaman the sprite of Megaman and he drew pretty much every other character except for the really obscure ones the Rym likes to think of You.

340
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:21,730
Scott: basically he took the Megaman sprite is the base sprite and then he modified it into all these other care.

341
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,037
Rym: Oh a lot of people do that with Kirby.

342
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:26,193
Rym: Yeah, so is there uh, There a Kraid in.

343
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:28,902
Rym: there is Samus but no Kraid.

344
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:30,567
Scott: Yeah, I don't think he's gonna do Kraid.

345
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:31,310
Rym: How about the cheetah, man?

346
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,538
Rym: He didn't do any of the cheetah, man.

347
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,704
Scott: It's a little obscure.

348
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:35,850
Rym: Not one cheetah, man.

349
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:37,398
Rym: I don't think it's that obscure.

350
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:42,243
Rym: In fact, I think it's more well known than a lot of Relatively name something that's not obscured.

351
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:48,246
Scott: It's probably on here Something all right, Dick Tracy That's not a video game that is.

352
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:51,089
Scott: It wasn't originally a video game.

353
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,940
Rym: So it has to be originally a video game.

354
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,970
Scott: most of the things on here originally a video game.

355
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:58,869
Scott: There's a couple things that aren't video games All right.

356
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:08,207
Rym: So very briefly before we get on to the main bit the meta moment We're gonna be at magfest and PAX East and PAX West and anime Boston and all those conventions.

357
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:09,230
Rym: the book club book.

358
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:17,120
Rym: We'll be finishing it soon World War Z the next Thursday episode So two weeks from today with Max Brooks And that'll probably the last Thursday episode.

359
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,810
Rym: that is a book club book because after that they're gonna be their own feed.

360
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,854
Scott: Oh, did we decide then?

361
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:21,698
Scott: Yeah everything.

362
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,550
Rym: I mean the whole big like book club thing is done.

363
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,001
Scott: Yeah, but that doesn't mean we had to make it not on Thursday.

364
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:28,950
Rym: I don't think we should waste Thursday episodes at that point.

365
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:31,117
Scott: We don't have enough ideas for Thursday.

366
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:32,341
Rym: you have plenty of ideas.

367
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:35,049

00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:25,870
Rym: I've never talked to him outside of business like very specific like packs business.

388
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:29,610
Scott: I've never talked to him for like 10 seconds when he took us from a point.

389
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:36,343
Rym: I've had other email conversations with him But they've always been a very specific things related to packs like specific question.

00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:37,065
Rym: any answers it.

391
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:44,478
Scott: or here's the flight We were on where we had two people because that's when you're when you're a blackberry guy like that and like Steve Jobs is an iPhone guy, right?

392
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:55,230
Rym: I'm not gonna be like hey Basically what they do is they only reply to emails they must reply to and they reply very shortly But at the same time they reply with exactly what they needed to reply with.

393
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:57,542
Rym: I was like, you know nothing extra as a question.

394
00:22:57,602 --> 00:22:59,210
Rym: Like where are the Baffa dads?

395
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,274
Rym: I need to know for packs and he's like Baffa dads are at X. Yeah, that's all they say and you know That's the way I'm at work.

396
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:06,882

00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:08,489

00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:11,102
Scott: Hey, let's get to know each other.

400
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,109
Scott: That doesn't happen.

401
00:23:13,651 --> 00:23:15,884
Rym: Anyway, yep, so I'll probably be at that.

402
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:21,624
Rym: All right And the GeekNights store is gonna be coming online fairly soon.

403
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:23,050
Rym: All the tech stuff is sorted out.

404
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,984
Scott: Let's go see here.

405
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:27,714
Scott: shop 589 days, huh?

406
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:29,841
Scott: Will you beat the two-year mark?

407
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:31,487
Rym: I am holding in my hand.

408
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,109
Rym: Actually.

409
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,490
Rym: No, I'm not.

410
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:32,873
Rym: I'm holding.

411
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:33,760
Rym: where the fuck did it go.

412
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:34,305
Rym: Oh here it is.

413
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:43,903
Rym: Okay, nevermind I'm holding in my hand a certificate of authority to collect New York State sales tax The only state in which I am obligated to collect sales tax.

414
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:45,569
Scott: Well, you're you're getting close to you.

415
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:53,776
Rym: So I swear to God if no one from New York even bothers because you realize if no New Yorkers Ever buy a t-shirt from us.

416
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:54,940
Rym: I didn't need this.

417
00:23:55,844 --> 00:23:57,310
Rym: I didn't need to go through all this bullshit.

418
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:58,729
Scott: What if only one does?

419
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:09,289
Rym: Then it was technically worth it Even though I have to remit the tax to New York and we're gonna charge you the goddamn tax if you buy from New York 8% or whatever plus the clothing tax.

420
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,150
Scott: Anyway, anyway, and not non clothing.

421
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:18,850
Rym: So we're gonna start by selling off the remaining stocks of our original get the pocketer off my internets t-shirt.

422
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:27,307
Rym: We've got two more t-shirts in the works and other things But those will come later and basically we're gonna take soft pre-orders for everything.

423
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:28,270
Rym: That might be expensive.

424
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:35,710
Rym: I'm not gonna order like five hundred hundred dollar hockey jerseys if I can't guarantee that at least one of you is gonna buy one.

425
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:37,884
Scott: all right the.

426
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:40,302
Scott: What's our show on?

427
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:40,828
Scott: so?

428
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,318
Rym: Rallies, well, I guess protest rallies and riots.

429
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,243
Scott: Oh, it's not car auto rallies.

430
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:48,309
Rym: Oh, man, that'd be a good show.

431
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:50,453
Rym: That'd be a real good show.

432
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:51,857
Rym: I really like rallies.

433
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:55,527
Rym: I also really like that because rallies are the only place we're drifting.

434
00:24:56,229 --> 00:25:00,141
Rym: actually Works well kind of but it doesn't really work.

435
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:05,730
Rym: Usually when you see someone doing a crazy crazy drift They fucked up and that's just them recovering anyway.

436
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:08,489
Scott: Kind of rally.

437
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:10,757
Rym: So I'm gonna get right to the point.

438
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:13,590
Rym: then we can talk about rallies and protests and riots and everything.

439
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,884
Rym: I think in the modern world protests don't do shit.

440
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:25,365
Rym: Well, it's not in America Protests defined by people with or without sign standing in front of something.

441
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:26,890
Rym: yelling don't do shit.

442
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:34,919
Scott: Yeah, if you're just standing around and or holding signs and or just yelling That's not gonna do anything right.

443
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:43,070
Scott: if you want to actually have an effect You need to have a protest that involves some sort of action or hinders people in some way.

444
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:47,970
Scott: You know, like if you just stand there while people cut down trees are gonna cut the trees.

445
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:54,409
Scott: But if you're gonna be a tree hugger and tie yourself to the tree You might be arrested but you'll maybe have an effect maybe.

446
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,274
Rym: well I maybe.

447
00:25:55,294 --> 00:26:02,150
Rym: it's the point that for a protest to be effective You have to have both an actual demand and an ultimatum.

448
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:06,070
Scott: But that you know, that's not to say that tying yourself to the tree is guaranteed to have an effect.

449
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,170
Scott: It's just if you don't actually do something you're guaranteed to have no effect.

450
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:18,068
Rym: But you need to demand an ultimatum and you have to actually be willing to follow through Absolutely, or you know, if your bluff gets called you have to be like, yeah, you called my bluff.

451
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:19,937
Rym: Never mind I don't want civil rights.

452
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:36,592
Rym: I Mean look at let's look at some Protests because outside of my building the Lincoln building in Manhattan for like months There have been protests by like the masonry whatever union at the rats outside my building this week Really?

453
00:26:36,612 --> 00:26:38,985
Rym: That rat was in front of my building for like a month straight.

454
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:44,310
Scott: from what I hear The rat is actually a scam where this one company wants you to hire them.

455
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:52,430
Rym: So if you hire a different company They come with a rat outside your building and they say something like this company employs shitty workers to do shitty work at low pay.

456
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,598
Rym: You should hire us instead, but it's like.

457
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:58,210
Scott: did anyone ask those people that they hired though are in the building working?

458
00:26:58,331 --> 00:27:02,572
Scott: So it's like when we ask them and they'll be like, um, I'm fine If they didn't.

459
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:04,682
Scott: if those people don't like what they're being paid.

460
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,330
Scott: How come they aren't outside with the red?

461
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:18,915
Rym: Because the rat doesn't do anything is not only does the rat have no effect and does no one care But usually the only people who pay attention to the rat are tourists because they see this giant inflatable rat and they think it's some Sort of attraction.

462
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:20,424
Scott: Yeah, they're like, what the hell is this?

463
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:20,807
Rym: Right?

464
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:21,229
Rym: I see people.

465
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,669
Rym: I see I've seen Japanese tourists taking their pictures with it.

466
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:33,330
Rym: Yeah for a while They actually stopped using the rat and they started using this coffin with a guy in it instead Because they were it was something about asbestos, but it was the same company doing the same thing.

467
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,535
Rym: They're like the company.

468
00:27:34,555 --> 00:27:42,930
Scott: the asbestos union is right near my apartment and you know They actually just read model their entire little Union Air Center and it's actually pretty nice now.

469
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,750
Rym: Ah, but they kept protesting in front of my building with the coffin and they're like the same thing.

470
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,201
Rym: You know incompetent people hired to remove asbestos in your building.

471
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:53,107
Rym: evil evil evil evil evil evil.

472
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:54,030
Rym: Here's a coffin.

473
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,977
Scott: Wait, they hired non-union guys girl.

474
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:57,563
Scott: It's like alright, so they're saving money.

475
00:27:57,603 --> 00:27:58,084
Scott: good on them.

476
00:27:58,104 --> 00:28:00,930
Rym: Yeah, just I'm not a union Me either.

477
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:04,076
Rym: So zero effect.

478
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:06,730
Rym: or what about the peace protesters even though I like these guys?

479
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,159
Scott: Yeah, those guys they stand in the corner, right?

480
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,183
Scott: They're having a good time.

481
00:28:10,204 --> 00:28:11,830
Rym: This was up in Hopewell Junction.

482
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:13,799
Scott: Everywhere in the US.

483
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:27,690
Rym: very specifically when we lived in Beacon we would often and until we realized it was stupid and stopped doing it drive up the road to the mall and the shop right and everything and Every weekend there were all these old people cool old people.

484
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:30,742
Rym: they'd sit on the corner and they were just protesting for peace.

485
00:28:30,762 --> 00:28:31,364
Rym: they were like honk.

486
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:35,701
Rym: if you want the Iraq war to end bring Our soldiers home and I rocked for those guys.

487
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,890
Rym: They were cool guys, but they had no effect on anything.

488
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,402
Scott: No, it was completely, you know a waste of time.

489
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,992
Scott: They weren't changing anyone's mind Right.

490
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:47,130
Scott: They weren't, you know, actually achieving anything that they wanted to achieve.

491
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,674
Scott: However, all they were doing was having a good time and honking Getting people to honk their horns.

492
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:53,481
Rym: However to their credit.

493
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:55,870
Rym: They had nothing better to do and they looked like they were having fun.

494
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:57,470
Rym: They're like we have a message.

495
00:28:57,771 --> 00:29:05,603
Rym: We're just gonna get our message out in the most effective way that we as old non-technological people not to get it out We're gonna sit here hang out and have fun and will.

496
00:29:05,623 --> 00:29:07,189
Rym: at least you know people honk and will know that.

497
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:07,892
Rym: yeah They saw us.

498
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:09,136
Rym: Maybe they care a little bit.

499
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:18,770
Rym: maybe and I remembered the saddest day was Driving up the road one day and seeing the counter protest of angry old people who were against peace.

500
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,377
Rym: Literally remember those guys.

501
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,226
Rym: they were like support our troops.

502
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:24,070
Scott: fuck Iraq.

503
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:27,909
Scott: They also achieved nothing.

504
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,257
Scott: Yeah complete except for wasting their own except.

505
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:42,729
Rym: so we had a protest that was like honk if you're against the Iraq war and honk if You're pro the Iraq war and they're at the same intersection and it was just old people Yep with nothing better to do.

506
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:49,810
Scott: Well, I think that a lot of the protests you see nowadays are you know old people unemployed people and occasionally young unemployed people.

507
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:56,450
Scott: It's pretty much no one who has a job is Protesting, you know anything especially not during the week or during the day.

508
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,760
Rym: Yeah, that's why the John Stewart rally had such.

509
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,729
Scott: you know that rat if there's any.

510
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:03,384
Scott: you know The people who are in the building working when the rat is there.

511
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:04,330
Scott: they have a job.

512
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:04,919
Scott: They're doing it.

513
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,055
Scott: right now People are standing near the rat.

514
00:30:07,095 --> 00:30:12,116
Scott: are standing near the rat because their company didn't get a job and they want you to hire their Company instead.

515
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:16,850
Scott: so because they have no work to do they're gonna Stand there with the rat to try to extort you into hiring them.

516
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,257
Scott: So they have work to do or like.

517
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:26,690
Rym: remember that one day I we're in Beacon and there was a family Mother and their kids standing outside one of those car dealerships with the sign that was like this car dealership ripped us off.

518
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:28,734
Rym: You don't remember that?

519
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:29,918
Rym: no, we drove by it.

520
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:31,603
Rym: We actually talked about it a lot.

521
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:33,067
Scott: I don't remember that really.

522
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:35,353
Rym: Yeah, so That's it.

523
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:36,500
Rym: I already said what happened.

524
00:30:36,943 --> 00:30:37,848
Rym: But yeah, I wasn't.

525
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:39,553
Scott: you know None of those.

526
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:43,970
Scott: if those people who are at time to complain about you know, the car dealers you're ripping them off.

527
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:45,429
Scott: They obviously didn't have work to do.

528
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:58,849
Rym: I hate to say it but in the modern world if you engage in Physical protest where you don't have an ultimatum and the will to follow through then you're basically Just proving that you don't understand the term opportunity cost.

529
00:31:00,714 --> 00:31:04,488
Scott: Well, I mean it's even even when you're not dealing with protesting right.

530
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:09,988
Scott: it's like I'll see people who will do all sorts of things that show that they don't understand opportunity cost.

531
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:14,063
Scott: for example I know people who will go to a comic book store and they'll buy comics.

532
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:26,990
Scott: They'll buy extra copies and You know they'll take extra to keep everything in mint condition and then they'll go and they'll like sell a whole bunch of stuff on eBay and Like speculate and try to make their money back right, you know, and they try to buy a comic.

533
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,707
Scott: They know the price is gonna go up or buy a variant cover and sell it for twice as much.

534
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:31,350
Scott: and it's like dude.

535
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:43,250
Scott: If you worked minimum wage at McDonald's for every hour you spent, you know buying and selling comic books that you're not reading You would probably making more money than you are on these comic books, right?

536
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:47,502
Scott: So, you know people just don't you know calculate like their time.

537
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:50,390
Scott: they don't factor in their own personal time into their monies.

538
00:31:50,971 --> 00:31:57,510
Scott: You know, it's like if you are standing there protesting for five hours, you know, you could have been working at McDonald's for five hours.

539
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:58,261
Scott: They'll hire you.

540
00:31:58,282 --> 00:32:07,522
Rym: Trust me See now a real protest would be like say this was about the gay marriage thing and a bunch of people got together and they Went to the White House and they had a march or a rally whatever.

541
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,630
Rym: that really doesn't have much effect.

542
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:14,499
Rym: But if they went and they're like we're not leaving until we get it Yeah, we're not leaving arrest us.

543
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,110
Scott: Yeah and block and you actually have to do so, you know, they're not good.

544
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,628
Rym: Oh, no, you don't necessarily have to block.

545
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:24,830
Rym: Well the thing is that often move moves your protests from peaceful legal protests to illegal.

546
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,253
Rym: They can arrest.

547
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:27,185
Scott: but that's exactly what the point is, right?

548
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:27,587
Scott: Is it you?

549
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:33,014
Rym: No, no No, it's only the point if by being arrested thorough style You can actually make a difference.

550
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:41,383
Rym: if I go smoke a joint to get arrested to then protest joint laws That's not gonna move my movement.

551
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:42,330
Rym: I'm just gonna be in jail.

552
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:44,097
Scott: No, but that's the whole thing.

553
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:48,959
Scott: It's like if you just stand there peacefully protesting without doing anything It's not gonna do anything.

554
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,470
Scott: You need to go and get arrested.

555
00:32:50,892 --> 00:32:51,273
Rym: I don't know.

556
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:54,387
Scott: you don't know that one guy smoking a joint isn't to do anything.

557
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:58,702
Scott: get 20,000 people to all light it up.

558
00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:03,559
Scott: Yes, Al at the same time Right or one guy smoking a joint isn't gonna do shit.

559
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:13,374
Rym: or if you go and say you're not gonna leave and you literally Don't leave if you've got a hundred thousand people not leaving maybe even you know hunger strike Some of that action.

560
00:33:13,394 --> 00:33:15,520
Scott: Yeah, you actually have to do something threatening.

561
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,950
Scott: that will make them, you know now they can't arrest you.

562
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:23,702
Scott: You know, all they can do is either a concede or B do something.

563
00:33:23,742 --> 00:33:24,604
Scott: That is very bad.

564
00:33:24,684 --> 00:33:26,710
Scott: PR like, you know massacre you.

565
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:31,270
Rym: I mean look at that's why Gandhi was able to win was that they were peaceful.

566
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,838
Scott: Yeah, I didn't just stand there.

567
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:35,070
Scott: He freaking took all the salt and dumped it in the ocean.

568
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:39,981
Scott: He would just not eat and people would be like, oh shit We better do what Gandhi says or he's gonna die from not eating.

569
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:43,078
Scott: and then what it's gonna be from us Oh shit, we can't have Gandhi.

570
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:46,553
Rym: see I know that the corollary here Protests don't work.

571
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:49,523
Rym: If the person you're protesting doesn't give a shit about you.

572
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:51,870
Scott: That's also absolutely correct, right?

573
00:33:52,130 --> 00:34:00,876
Scott: So let's say you are protesting, you know against police brutality and then the police brutalize you But they don't give a shit.

574
00:34:00,896 --> 00:34:02,241
Scott: They're like, yeah, we brutalize you.

575
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:02,943
Scott: What are you gonna do?

576
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:04,850
Scott: Come get brutalized again motherfuckers.

577
00:34:05,591 --> 00:34:08,349
Scott: Then no amount of protesting as the police brutality is gonna work.

578
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:11,168
Rym: Yeah, your protest has to be aimed at the people who can do something about.

579
00:34:11,228 --> 00:34:13,275
Scott: yeah The only the only public outrage.

580
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:19,190
Scott: Yeah, the only you know protest that's actually gonna work against something like that is probably violence.

581
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:19,893
Scott: You know.

582
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,925
Scott: see no no or voting if you can do that.

583
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:26,503
Rym: when I say where you are We say a threat because the threat doesn't imply violence necessarily not necessarily.

584
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:30,012
Rym: It's just an ultimatum, but we want X and You know there.

585
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:31,998
Rym: we will not compromise on that.

586
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,349
Rym: Yep, but I've never seen effective protests in America anymore Not in my life in recent times.

587
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:51,250
Rym: This is why John Stewart's rally headsets resonance because the first thing they said it's like look it's on a Saturday For a couple hours because we know that you have jobs and yet to do but it still didn't do anything.

588
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,389
Scott: It was basically a free concert for everybody.

589
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,053
Rym: Yeah, it was.

590
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,270
Rym: no we'll get to that because you know, the next step up from a protest is a movement or a rally.

591
00:34:58,792 --> 00:34:59,394
Scott: Yeah, what's?

592
00:34:59,454 --> 00:35:00,658
Scott: it's not really a different approach.

593
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:02,987
Scott: Yeah, I went to the rally protest with a schedule.

594
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:03,910
Rym: I went to the rally.

595
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,056
Rym: I kind of didn't want to go.

596
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:07,510
Rym: I bailed on it cuz I was like this is gonna fail and be a disaster.

597
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,739
Rym: But I went for the hell of it.

598
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:12,510
Rym: I got slightly optimistic and nah, it was a boring disaster.

599
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,499
Scott: It was the only thing I got.

600
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,573
Scott: I watched it on the Internet's and I was like, oh, that's exactly what I thought I was gonna be.

601
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:17,815
Rym: Yep.

602
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:21,178
Rym: The only surprising thing drive all that way Is that a lot of people showed up.

603
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:21,923
Rym: it gave me a lot of hope.

604
00:35:21,963 --> 00:35:33,810
Rym: it proved to me that yes There are a lot of rational people and everyone there was totally chill, but it had zero effect on anything Other than it made the people who showed up feel good made them feel like they did something.

605
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,830
Scott: Yeah, but I mean if you felt like you did something then clearly you weren't that rational, right?

606
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,670
Scott: I mean, it's basically it looked to me when I was looking at pictures on the internet was like, okay It was it was a normal person.

607
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,092
Rym: It was like.

608
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:48,870
Scott: it was like 80% cool people showed up all at the same place at the same time.

609
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,390
Scott: And I guess it's cool to hang out with cool people just like it packs or whatever it is.

610
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:55,530
Scott: Everyone was totally cool, but it's like if you went to packs and there were no games.

611
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:02,825
Rym: However, that would have been fine because I could I could have a lot of fun Just going to restaurants and hanging out because you bring your own Games with you.

612
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:04,609
Rym: But here's the trouble.

613
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:11,874
Rym: Washington DC sucks ass sure does and the entire city was basically Make protests.

614
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:18,199
Scott: if Washington D. Imagine it'd be so easy and comfortable to protest in New York If you had to protest, you know the fact.

615
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:20,250
Scott: that's why they put DC in DC and not New York.

616
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,530
Scott: So that way it's like no one wants to protest is there for that long because it sucks.

617
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:35,143
Rym: but I basically all that rally taught me was that I will never go to a rally again in the rest of my life because they're pointless and Boring, but here is an example of some kind of protest that actually does something right.

618
00:36:35,184 --> 00:36:38,536
Scott: so look at this recent news with Amazon And the pedophile book.

619
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:40,165
Rym: you see that I saw that I.

620
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:41,130
Scott: so basically is what happened?

621
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:47,951
Scott: there's some pedophile guy wrote a Guide for pedophiles, and he put it on the Kindle on Amazon Which he can do.

622
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:52,464
Scott: and Amazon at first was like free speech you know hey, whatever.

623
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:56,262
Scott: and I also agree free speech I mean it wasn't didn't have child porn in it.

624
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:57,450
Scott: It was just a book up.

625
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,290
Scott: You know it's no different than anarchist cookbook.

626
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:07,376
Scott: Just you know not like I would buy this book or that I agree with the book or I say pedophilia is good I wait wait But just like the anarchist cookbook.

627
00:37:07,617 --> 00:37:11,850
Rym: so it gives you instructions that if you follow them will cause a small child to explode killing you.

628
00:37:12,372 --> 00:37:17,822
Scott: It gives you lots of instructions on how to be a pedophile, and it's like It's pretty disgusting book anyway.

629
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:18,950
Rym: How do I even read it?

630
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,818
Scott: I don't know from what I I didn't read it either, but I read basically with the Discussion of it.

631
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:24,947
Scott: was that for example.

632
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:26,889
Scott: It's a book That's like hey if you're a pedophile.

633
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:30,445
Scott: Listen you should do this and you shouldn't do this that way you won't get caught.

634
00:37:30,485 --> 00:37:33,075
Scott: and if you don't if you do get caught You get a lighter sentence in this way.

635
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,982
Scott: You know you won't hurt the children.

636
00:37:35,023 --> 00:37:36,006
Scott: You'll just you know.

637
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:40,838
Scott: it's like oh Okay It's that kind of book you know.

638
00:37:40,899 --> 00:37:42,770
Scott: very questionable, and I don't agree with the book.

639
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:48,503
Scott: But I agree that the book should be allowed to exist and be sold because freedom of speech But at the same time no store should be required to sell it.

640
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:49,549
Scott: no that's also true.

641
00:37:50,372 --> 00:37:56,190
Scott: But these people on Amazon in the comments they protested, but they didn't protest just by going rabble rabble rabble.

642
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,997
Scott: They actually said we're boycotting Amazon.

643
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:00,910
Scott: is some lady was like I emptied my shopping cart when I saw this book on here.

644
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:02,875
Scott: The Amazon removed the book.

645
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:05,421
Scott: they actually did something they boycotted.

646
00:38:05,441 --> 00:38:13,642
Scott: a an actual doing of something you have to actually do Something you know or you know a stopping of doing something that you were doing.

647
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:16,450
Scott: you know like you will go and protest Walmart.

648
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:21,784
Scott: It's like well stop shopping there And you know what if you can't get enough people to stop shopping there Walmart staying in town.

649
00:38:21,945 --> 00:38:22,025
Scott: or

650
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:29,023
Rym: like I was in the the big Rally movement marched against the Iraq war when it first started by accident well I sure I was in New York anyway

651
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:29,708
Scott: happened to be

652
00:38:29,728 --> 00:38:30,874
Rym: yeah I have to be in New York even

653
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:32,240
Scott: though it was going on and I and

654
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:42,246
Rym: then I see these street like I was walking around And then the streets got barricaded around me, and I was kind of trapped and like what's going on, and then I realized Oh, there's a giant protest against the Iraq war.

655
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:46,410
Rym: well I'm against the war and I'm already in and I just walked along with it.

656
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:46,932
Rym: I was just there.

657
00:38:47,073 --> 00:38:56,170
Rym: he just walked down the street and what he walking down a street accomplish now had Those people who had all been there said and we're gonna stop paying taxes until the war is done.

658
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:58,745
Rym: Yep, that would have been a movement.

659
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:01,337
Scott: that would have been But it wasn't huh?

660
00:39:01,678 --> 00:39:04,730
Scott: instead all he did was walk, and they got good leg exercise.

661
00:39:05,312 --> 00:39:07,300
Rym: So I mean, but then again you could go too far.

662
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,228
Rym: the next step from a rally is of course riot.

663
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:14,609
Scott: Well, you know the thing with the right is that it only works in certain situations, right?

664
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:16,810
Rym: Only works if it leads to revolution.

665
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:29,505
Scott: Yeah, and you know the main thing the main problem we have in the u.s.. Right as Lee or at least in any you know Relatively stable democracy is that you can't really overthrow the government with just violence.

666
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:39,130
Scott: right like let's say something crazy happened And you know I mean and we managed to like do something ridiculous like killing all the congressman or something just out of control, right?

667
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:45,349
Scott: anyone Anyone managed to actually succeed at some sort of ludicrous violence, right?

668
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,481
Scott: The government even the government would stay in power.

669
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,927
Scott: you wouldn't be able to unseat it.

670
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:53,699
Rym: if nothing else It's like a chicken without a head.

671
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,830
Rym: It'll keep running for a long time.

672
00:39:56,031 --> 00:39:59,330
Scott: Hey, you can't stop the US government with any amount of violence.

673
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:11,590
Scott: I'm gonna tell all the generals and all to everybody because the sheer momentum of bureaucracy at all levels Just be new elections, and they'll just appoint new representatives, and they'll elect a new president, and there's a big chain.

674
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:13,496
Scott: We know who the next president's gonna be.

675
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:18,270
Scott: it's gonna be the dogcatcher from you know some Kentucky or something you know.

676
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,594
Scott: no It's gonna be someone.

677
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:19,674
Scott: you.

678
00:40:20,076 --> 00:40:26,124
Scott: there's nothing you can do Right, but meanwhile if you're in a tiny country right or some unstable country.

679
00:40:26,144 --> 00:40:27,328
Scott: That's not a democracy layer.

680
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:28,350
Scott: Somalia That's perfect.

681
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,492
Rym: Yeah, all right can actually lead to Evolution.

682
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:35,009
Scott: if you're in Somalia, and you fucking kill all the warlords guess what you're in charge.

683
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:36,108
Scott: well It works.

684
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:36,673
Rym: I think it.

685
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:44,230
Rym: more fundamentally this can be defined is just the idea that The civil order of America is too strong to be overthrown and also violence.

686
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:46,224
Scott: We are it could be overthrown in other ways.

687
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:49,698
Rym: as a society We are very intolerant of breakdowns of civil order.

688
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:53,289
Rym: basically the moment you riot the entire country is against you.

689
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:57,602
Rym: yep No, and if something were big enough to where you write everyone's with you.

690
00:40:57,944 --> 00:40:59,368
Rym: that means civil order collapse.

691
00:40:59,649 --> 00:41:02,981
Scott: yep You know I mean like look you they had written.

692
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,630
Scott: like you know we do have riots here.

693
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,377
Scott: They're mostly out in like the West a bit There's like you know Rodney King riots.

694
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:13,700
Scott: right that was a long time ago was a long time ago But you know and they kind of work every now and then.

695
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,704
Rym: but what worked?

696
00:41:14,744 --> 00:41:15,347
Rym: in what sense?

697
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:15,989
Scott: yeah?

698
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:22,570
Scott: I mean the LA police are still Racially profiling everybody, and it's still police brutality everywhere.

699
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:28,930
Rym: Yep, but just people have no patience for anyone who violently disrupt civil order on a wide scale.

700
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,703
Rym: I mean whenever a riot happens pretty much everyone just wants the riot to stop.

701
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:34,550
Scott: yep except for people writing.

702
00:41:35,531 --> 00:41:40,890
Rym: Yeah, but even then I get the impression that most of the people riding don't care about the cause of originally sparking them.

703
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,729
Scott: No, I think that most of the people at least in the u.s.

704
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:49,630
Scott: Who riot are people who just kind of want to do rioting activities like looting and vandalizing and smashing and you know hurting and whatever.

705
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:51,930
Scott: And the riot is just an excuse.

706
00:41:52,272 --> 00:41:57,990
Scott: It's like they're sitting there, and they really want to hurt people and break things But they don't right because no one else is doing it.

707
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:06,356
Scott: But if everyone starts doing it all right I can do it is that everyone's doing it whoo and they let loose which what they wanted to do anyway and No one else really wants to do that.

708
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:09,568
Scott: so then you basically all these people reveal their true selves.

709
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:11,194
Scott: you catch them And then the riot stuff.

710
00:42:11,214 --> 00:42:13,984
Rym: so you know look at the anti-war protests back in the 60s.

711
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:16,291
Rym: those were much more like real Protests.

712
00:42:16,673 --> 00:42:17,396
Rym: I mean Kent State.

713
00:42:17,437 --> 00:42:18,019
Rym: they got shot.

714
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:20,170
Scott: Yeah, well they got shot, but what did you know?

715
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:20,833
Scott: They didn't.

716
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:22,361
Scott: what did they do to start it?

717
00:42:22,381 --> 00:42:23,970
Scott: They've like pushed the police a little bit.

718
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,716
Scott: You know they weren't.

719
00:42:24,756 --> 00:42:31,006
Scott: they were basically standing around yelling Just you know more angrily yeah, but nowadays people just kind of stand there.

720
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:32,010
Rym: They're boring.

721
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:33,554
Rym: But remember RIT.

722
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:35,759
Scott: we had a riot that wasn't much of a riot.

723
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:39,469
Scott: well riot police came that's true, but no one was rioting.

724
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:42,034
Scott: basically There was a party.

725
00:42:42,114 --> 00:42:47,670
Scott: it was a very large party and then you know they call it was an organized flash mob party.

726
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,010
Rym: We're basically out of nowhere.

727
00:42:49,030 --> 00:43:02,227
Rym: You know we lived in colony which was like this apartment complex Like on like right next to campus kind of isolated like by itself like connected but like across the street and away and suddenly all over campus these flyers appeared saying colony Palooza on x-date

728
00:43:02,548 --> 00:43:02,828
Scott: yep

729
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,774
Rym: and Everyone threw a party.

730
00:43:04,794 --> 00:43:09,570
Rym: it was the biggest fucking party RIT had ever seen and basically somebody called the police on this party.

731
00:43:09,872 --> 00:43:12,670
Scott: So I remember it's like why did you just let the party go?

732
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,009
Scott: Why did you have to say you know if you didn't try to stop it?

733
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,900
Scott: It wouldn't have been an issue, but they wanted to stop it.

734
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,343
Scott: the party was actually going fine People standing out there party.

735
00:43:20,404 --> 00:43:21,150
Rym: it was just a big frat.

736
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,178
Rym: So they call the campus safety.

737
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:25,547
Scott: and then it you know because campus safety tried to break it up.

738
00:43:26,611 --> 00:43:27,637
Scott: Then a conflict began.

739
00:43:27,657 --> 00:43:29,850
Scott: It's like if you just not done anything that wouldn't have been a conflict.

740
00:43:29,971 --> 00:43:32,046
Rym: It was kind of hilarious, but went down.

741
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:32,550
Rym: apparently

742
00:43:32,731 --> 00:43:37,150
Scott: I mean there were some people throwing like glass bottles at campus safety and or the police I

743
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:46,542
Rym: don't know what specifically happened was one we're hanging out And we're watching the party because we lived in in the middle of this and in fact the main body of the party was Directly outside of our first floor window.

744
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,850
Scott: Yeah, so we just watched the whole party.

745
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:59,691
Rym: We're watching the party kind of enjoying it and whatever and hanging out We're playing like D&D and whatever and then our friends leave and they call us, and they're like Yeah, every cop in the world is on their way to Colony.

746
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:01,329
Rym: so we're expecting fun.

747
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:09,828
Rym: What happened was campus safety showed up and they were you know telling the party to quiet down and someone in the crowd threw a Beer bottle and it hit a campus safety guy in the head.

748
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:14,145
Rym: So he retreated and riot police showed up and formed a battle line.

749
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:15,450
Scott: They just formed a big line.

750
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:23,378
Scott: They all had shields and armor and whatever and basically the party people kept partying and left a gap between them and the police and Didn't do anything which was fine.

751
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,580
Rym: the riot police didn't actually give an ultimatum yet They just stood there.

752
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:33,650
Rym: yeah And eventually the riot police like yell at the party to disperse and the party is like fuck you guys But no violence happens.

753
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,490
Rym: I'm just kind of standing there, and I decided to go out and see the party at this point.

754
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,230
Rym: You know watch the riot police see what's going on.

755
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:50,090
Rym: I walk around a little bit and as we're walking out Everyone starts screaming and running because the riot police Moved in after the crowd started chanting you can't arrest us all you can't arrest us all.

756
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:53,122
Rym: That's when the paintballs and the dogs came out.

757
00:44:53,183 --> 00:44:53,725
Scott: It was mostly.

758
00:44:53,785 --> 00:44:54,930
Scott: I didn't see any dog action.

759
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,155
Rym: I'm what are you talking about?

760
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:56,818
Rym: We have a show.

761
00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:02,096
Rym: we did a long time ago where you talked about the dog Right outside our window.

762
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:02,859
Rym: we're sitting there right.

763
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:07,290
Rym: we're watching the riot police move in and this guy Directly in front of her window reaches down.

764
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:17,010
Rym: He's drunk picks up a bottle raises it to throw it at the riot police and the riot guide looks at him Signals the dog runs up takes him down by the neck and then they pepper balled him in the face.

765
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:21,747
Scott: Yeah, it's mostly paint balls full of pepper mace which by the way came into our windows.

766
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:22,490
Rym: that sucked ass.

767
00:45:22,611 --> 00:45:24,070
Scott: I didn't really yeah, and it really sucked.

768
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:24,492
Scott: And you know what.

769
00:45:24,552 --> 00:45:27,970
Scott: I think that that's actually become one of the most popular police weapons these days.

770
00:45:28,251 --> 00:45:31,545
Rym: Oh, there's this great video in college humor of this crazy homeless guy.

771
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:32,630
Scott: I thought they used them on him.

772
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,133
Scott: I saw that.

773
00:45:33,214 --> 00:45:34,522
Rym: yeah, it didn't slow him down.

774
00:45:34,764 --> 00:45:35,770
Scott: No, but it's like tasers.

775
00:45:35,951 --> 00:45:39,910
Scott: It's like tasers have a stigma, but like these pepper balls, it's like please love those fucking things.

776
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,754
Scott: Yeah, and why not?

777
00:45:40,794 --> 00:45:48,370
Scott: It's like you can just shoot him at anyone and if you actually get hit with those Oh, man, you're like, oh you're out and it's like you can mace someone from really far away.

778
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:56,936
Rym: However, I was not pleased with the fact that the police provided covering fire at all the balconies while they moved in Filling our apartment with pepper.

779
00:45:56,956 --> 00:45:58,260
Scott: Yeah, it was not cool.

780
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:05,140
Rym: Ah Anyway, that right the thing is there was such like faux outrage on campus the next day.

781
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,072
Rym: Everyone's like, oh my god There was a riot and the riot police came in.

782
00:46:09,153 --> 00:46:10,680
Rym: fuck RIT blah blah blah blah blah.

783
00:46:11,142 --> 00:46:12,429
Rym: And then everyone forgot.

784
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,238
Rym: no one on campus probably even remembers that.

785
00:46:14,258 --> 00:46:24,485
Rym: yeah I don't know if anyone campus remembers it but at least people who were there and people, you know We remember it but there were people who remembered it with this like outrage and anger and I remember it as this dumb funny thing That happened on campus.

786
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:25,752
Rym: It didn't accomplish anything.

787
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:33,280
Scott: It wasn't a riot for anything No, but I think what it shows though is that you know a lot of protests and riots that have conflict like that.

788
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:36,420
Scott: It's really only because somebody went and opposed it.

789
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:45,652
Scott: It's like if you just if someone's protesting a riot or doing something you don't like Don't just don't go over there and pester them just let them do their thing and there won't be any fighting.

790
00:46:45,813 --> 00:46:51,473
Scott: fighting only happens if Police or an opposing force appears to actually instigate.

791
00:46:51,513 --> 00:46:53,439
Scott: it's like, you know, the police didn't show up.

792
00:46:54,123 --> 00:47:02,841
Scott: People would have just gotten drunk until about 5 a.m And then eventually all passed out and vomited or whatever and then and then they could discard the fire department to come and hose everybody Down.

793
00:47:02,902 --> 00:47:04,909
Scott: Yeah, what actually that would have been great.

794
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:08,080
Rym: The fire department should have just showed up and hosed everybody down.

795
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,004
Rym: That would end at the party.

796
00:47:09,024 --> 00:47:12,820
Scott: Yeah, but you know, the thing is like there was no harm being done.

797
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,953
Scott: There was only an issue because you tried to shut it down.

798
00:47:15,974 --> 00:47:18,805
Scott: if you would have just left it alone It would just gone away.

799
00:47:18,825 --> 00:47:20,773
Scott: There's some crazy people protesting like the rat.

800
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,360
Scott: just ignore the stupid rat.

801
00:47:22,862 --> 00:47:23,283
Rym: Here's the thing.

802
00:47:23,303 --> 00:47:23,946
Rym: everyone ignores them.

803
00:47:23,986 --> 00:47:25,592
Scott: Anyway, that's what I'm saying.

804
00:47:25,954 --> 00:47:26,536
Rym: So you don't need.

805
00:47:26,576 --> 00:47:27,660
Rym: that's not advice for anyone.

806
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,768
Scott: It's advice for the people who called the cops.

807
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:31,133
Scott: Don't don't do the head.

808
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:31,715
Scott: Just let it go.

809
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:34,675
Rym: I Mean, I don't know what else we can say.

810
00:47:34,695 --> 00:47:36,473
Rym: it Protests are stupid now.

811
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:37,160
Rym: They don't do anything.

812
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,205
Rym: They're basically that there's.

813
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:41,299
Rym: they're like wearing a sign that says I have nothing better to do right now.

814
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:42,645
Scott: Yeah, very much.

815
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:45,478
Scott: You can translate every protest sign into I have nothing better to do.

816
00:47:45,558 --> 00:47:49,851
Scott: Yeah So if you're gonna protest it is something you don't like.

817
00:47:50,072 --> 00:47:51,256
Scott: it's something you want to change.

818
00:47:51,537 --> 00:47:51,898
Scott: you have to.

819
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,295
Scott: you know Don't standing around with signs is not really gonna help right?

820
00:47:56,316 --> 00:47:57,420
Scott: You need to do something.

821
00:47:57,963 --> 00:48:00,900
Rym: I mean unless you're going you have to do something that cannot be ignored.

822
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:08,100
Scott: Yeah, I mean for example, right there is sometimes where you can help in some ways For example, when the anonymous you will protest Scientology, right?

823
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:15,617
Scott: They're not really gonna stop Scientology in any way with that But Sarah with science, but they might be able to inform people who don't know.

824
00:48:15,657 --> 00:48:16,280
Rym: that's what I'm saying.

825
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:25,592
Rym: they were at least raising awareness about a thing that people do care about because I even know a lot of smart people who don't Actually realize the Scientology is a crazy batshit cult made up by a sci-fi author.

826
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:33,080
Rym: That's incredibly dangerous and takes all your money Yeah, but there are people who don't know that yeah, and anonymous does a good job of getting that word out.

827
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,795
Scott: But I mean spreading awareness isn't really protesting right?

828
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:41,877
Scott: I mean it might look like Yeah, cuz they might stand outside the Scientology place with signs.

829
00:48:41,897 --> 00:48:42,780
Rym: they were there the other day.

830
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,937
Scott: So it looks like a protest but it's you know, it's not really a protest cuz they're not really.

831
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:47,599
Scott: you know.

832
00:48:48,603 --> 00:48:49,365
Scott: Do this?

833
00:48:49,746 --> 00:48:50,549
Scott: do this cuz?

834
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:56,443
Scott: I said so all they're saying is hey people who you know This thing is that you're looking at here.

835
00:48:56,543 --> 00:48:57,965
Scott: Isn't what it appears to be.

836
00:48:58,086 --> 00:49:03,124
Scott: It's it's more like, you know standing on a soapbox and Preaching than protesting.

837
00:49:03,465 --> 00:49:03,926
Rym: Well, that's it.

838
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:08,880
Rym: It's something that can't be ignored because it gathers more media attention than Scientology can direct away from it.

839
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:12,132
Scott: Yep, you know and the thing also they have alternate utility.

840
00:49:12,172 --> 00:49:25,160
Scott: they do it for the laws, of course And you know while there are many, you know, you could say well look, you know We stood out there and we protested for the White House for three days with our signs and we were getting awareness, right?

841
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,775
Rym: So, you know our protests, but if awareness doesn't lead to action, it's useless.

842
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:29,820
Scott: That's true.

843
00:49:30,081 --> 00:49:36,942
Scott: But at the same time I think a lot of people protest things that they're not increasing any awareness Whatsoever.

844
00:49:37,003 --> 00:49:41,380
Scott: like if you go protest in front of like an abortion clinic as many people do who have nothing better to do.

845
00:49:42,601 --> 00:49:44,189
Scott: No, they're not increasing any awareness.

846
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,999
Scott: people people fucking know what abortion is.

847
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:50,619
Scott: You're not making anyone aware who is not aware.

848
00:49:51,562 --> 00:49:53,740
Rym: I mean if I go stay even if well, we could try to resume it.

849
00:49:53,800 --> 00:50:01,913
Rym: What if we go outside of you know, chiropractor offices and just hand out brochures pointing out his bullshit But what it signs and we could do that we could do that.

850
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:02,596
Rym: Maybe we should do that.

851
00:50:02,657 --> 00:50:05,493
Scott: problem is you know We know why I don't do that because people are stupid.

852
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:06,318
Scott: I got something better to do.

853
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:13,757
Scott: Yeah Good types of protests, right?

854
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,305
Scott: Boycotting, you know.

855
00:50:16,426 --> 00:50:23,124
Scott: actually, you know If like there's a Walmart and you want to protest it if that store is empty for a whole day They will be fucking.

856
00:50:23,325 --> 00:50:25,211
Rym: but it only works if it can't be ignored.

857
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:35,340
Rym: if I boycott Walmart and no one else does no effect No Have to do something that has an ultimatum and a goal and cannot be ignored by the people who have the power to take action.

858
00:50:35,563 --> 00:50:43,420
Scott: yep, or You know me, you know book burning doesn't really help right because it's just like whatever dude.

859
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:47,815
Scott: But you know if you were to don't you don't got a Quran.

860
00:50:47,855 --> 00:50:49,120
Rym: now, you've got no Quran.

861
00:50:50,043 --> 00:50:50,686
Rym: I love that guy.

862
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:56,337
Scott: if you made a meme right and thus we're able to You know get the the book.

863
00:50:56,377 --> 00:50:59,791
Scott: so, you know They got you know a machine of death to the top of Amazon.

864
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:08,275
Scott: if you're able to get something to the bottom of Amazon Which I don't think I think it's kind of hard to do that because if you draw attention to it You're only gonna increase sales whether it's positive or negative attention.

865
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:12,309
Rym: cuz you are you know At least one crazy pedophile, but maybe news.

866
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:13,854
Rym: and they were like, oh there's a guy.

867
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:23,660
Scott: but maybe if you spam the Amazon Reviews to get it all the way down to zero stars Maybe that would you know, keep it away from getting high in the search results and would crush its sales.

868
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:30,855
Rym: Maybe we should get an organized movement of anti Pseudoscience bullshit people to just put bad reviews on Amazon for all the pseudoscience bullshit.

869
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:32,140
Scott: Maybe we could do that.

870
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:39,150
Scott: Yeah, but you know you had to actually do something that has some effect on some Saying the same thing over and over again.

871
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,652
Rym: I think we're done.

872
00:51:39,753 --> 00:51:40,075
Rym: We're done.

873
00:51:40,095 --> 00:51:40,960
Scott: I'm hungry.
