1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:14,199
Rym: It's Thursday, March 17th, 2011, though in a moment we're going to say it's March 10th, because you see we recorded this episode before PAX, the Penny Arcade Expo East in Boston and one thing led to another, I never actually put the episode up.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:32,180
Rym: So, because we're tired from PAX and because this upcoming weekend is Zenkai Con in King of Prussia we're a little busy and we're just totally copping out, didn't do any shows this week so I'm going to retroactively put this episode up on a brand new date but it's actually the show we recorded before PAX.

3
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:39,320
Rym: I will also say that the Penny Arcade Expo went very very well, we'll have a review of that coming soon, probably next week.

4
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,100
Rym: So if you saw us at the Con, you thought we were awesome, or you hated us.

5
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:48,719
Rym: have no fear, our review will be up soon and maybe we'll talk a little more about My Little Pony, I know it was very popular at PAX.

6
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:55,500
Rym: Without further ado, I'm going to let the music play and the episode we recorded somewhat haphazardly will begin.

7
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:07,796
Rym: It's Thursday, March 10th, I'm Rym.

8
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:08,360
Scott: I'm Scott.

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,867
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

10
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:12,299
Rym: Tonight, before we go to PAX, it's BK.

11
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,428
Rym: Let's do this.

12
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:22,880
Rym: Scott, I got a problem.

13
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:23,840
Rym: Alright.

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,420
Rym: So, it's been a while since something like this has happened, but uh I think about the ponies.

15
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,620
Scott: Enough with the ponies!

16
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:33,100
Rym: A little bit more often than I think is healthy.

17
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,280
Scott: Listen, I know the ponies have infected all brains they have come in contact with.

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,459
Scott: The pony brain virus is an epidemic at this point, however I believe you mean the pony pox.

19
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,040
Scott: Sure.

20
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:49,620
Scott: We have managed to contain it to a single GeekNights episode.

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,940
Scott: It is quarantined, let us not let it spread, that is the end of the discussion of anything related to miniature horses in this episode.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,339
Rym: Except you know you're thinking about them too.

23
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,411
Scott: Doesn't matter, we're done.

24
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:11,319
Scott: Alright, so moving on to something else that is not that because it must not leave the episode to which it is contained lest humanity become extinct and grow hooves.

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,040
Rym: I posit that the only reason we will be able to restrict it so is that we're doing another project.

26
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,160
Scott: You're still talking about it.

27
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:22,279
Scott: So let me go to some news here.

28
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,080
Rym: The news that you took forever to find because there's nothing you want to talk about?

29
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,600
Scott: Yeah, so a new Ted just happened, right?

30
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,460
Scott: The conference that makes all the awesome videos.

31
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,200
Rym: I feel like we should make a parody set of talks the Todd Talks and it's just bad ideas.

32
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,599
Scott: We could do that.

33
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:39,420
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

34
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:44,955
Scott: And there was apparently a lot of really awesome stuff shown yet again as is always.

35
00:02:46,493 --> 00:03:00,500
Scott: But and I encourage everybody the Ted Talks are really good and when you get a chance watch them when they come out and look for people to tell you which ones are the good ones worth watching because some of them are like 15 minutes a lot of time.

36
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:09,560
Scott: The thing is, there are some people out there I've seen are starting to have some negative things to say about Ted and it's like what could you possibly say negative about Ted?

37
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,079
Rym: I can say one negative thing.

38
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,619
Rym: It is somewhat pricey for me to go.

39
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,080
Scott: Well, here's the thing, right?

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,714
Scott: Apparently it doesn't matter how much money you have if you want to go, right?

41
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:19,299
Scott: Here's the thing.

42
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:31,580
Scott: It's basically you know, while Ted does a lot of good stuff and they spread ideas with free videos and they have the TEDx which is pretty cool you know, and that kind of stuff, right?

43
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:45,640
Scott: and the fellowships and all these things the conference itself the Ted, the real Ted the main conference is pretty much make rich people feel really good about themselves for a couple days.

44
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,973
Rym: Ah, but think about what it's doing.

45
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:49,640
Rym: The rich people pay a lot of money to be involved, too, right?

46
00:03:49,640 --> 00:04:01,779
Scott: Well, okay, so here's a story I read, I can't find the link again but you know, somebody whoever wrote the story was friends with somebody and that somebody got them into a Ted once, right?

47
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:02,873
Scott: Uh huh.

48
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,557
Scott: So that, once you're basically on the list then you can go.

49
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,280
Scott: So, a couple years later, this person right, wanted to go to Ted this year.

50
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:14,186
Scott: they wanted to go to 2011, they went previously another year.

51
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,740
Rym: Alright, so they want to go again and they should be able to, according to this rule.

52
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:20,940
Scott: so they bought a ticket for a shit ton of money, right?

53
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,980
Scott: with thousands of dollars, and they got a ticket.

54
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:36,184
Scott: but then, apparently, that person who I think they said was a former employer right, uh, it was a huge benefactor of Ted and that former employer pretty much told Ted they didn't want that person to go.

55
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:36,285
Scott: What?

56
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:40,499
Scott: So that person didn't go, they just took their ticket away and they don't have to tell you why.

57
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,731
Rym: I don't know, I'm leery of a story that you heard from some guy who heard it from a guy he knows.

58
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:49,800
Scott: No, this story was written by the person who had their ticket taken away.

59
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:53,600
Scott: I just can't find the link again, but I swear I am not making this shit up.

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,322
Rym: Huh, I'm, I don't know, I'm still slightly dubious, I mean, maybe I

61
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:18,934
Scott: am also slightly dubious, but it also doesn't sound that, you know, that I get the feeling that it's like also from what people have gone there, you know to the real Ted, is basically what happens at the real Ted is, as soon you know, when you're watching, uh the show, the talks right, basically all the famous and rich people are up front, and everyone else is in the peanut gallery in the back.

62
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:20,652
Rym: That's fine that's how everything is.

63
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:33,220
Scott: Right, so that way the peanut gallery doesn't get on TV and the rich people are in the videos, right, when they get audience shots, right but at the same time, basically what happens in between sessions, or when they're having dinner, or any of those sorts of things

64
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:33,886
Rym: is

65
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:39,785
Scott: all the rich and famous people talk on one side of the room and all the not famous people on the other side of the room.

66
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:40,917
Rym: Is there a rope?

67
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,736
Scott: No, but that's the thing, is basically everyone has sort of a social problem, trying to go across the room.

68
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:50,695
Rym: I'll tell you this, I would not have that problem, I would be right up in Bill Gates' grill, being like, "Hey

69
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:51,038
Rym: man!"

70
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:53,520
Rym: And he would basically brush you off big time.

71
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,331
Rym: Yeah, I've been brushed off by people before, I can deal with that.

72
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,518
Scott: But basically, you just go across the room, you get brushed off, because they don't want to have anything to do with you.

73
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:03,888
Rym: I would start a revolution, we'd all go over there, be real annoying.

74
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:06,632
Scott: Yeah, but that's what people seem to, you know.

75
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:08,633
Rym: Here's the reason I'm dubious about that story.

76
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:14,130
Rym: Why would someone care if some other person attended a conference to see speeches?

77
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:17,926
Scott: Because, I guess they were drama people, you know, the kind of people who have drama.

78
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,219
Rym: I just, I don't understand that kind of drama, I never have.

79
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,019
Scott: No, but we don't understand that drama, but we see it all the time.

80
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:28,690
Rym: Much like Pinkie Pie's tale, we see it all the time but we don't understand it.

81
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:37,679
Scott: I mean, I've never been to Ted, I don't know how true this is, for all I know you go to Ted and the rich people mostly want to talk to the normal people, because they talk to rich people anytime they want, who knows, right?

82
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,820
Scott: But, that's sort of believable, right?

83
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,499
Rym: But at the same time, consider this.

84
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,228
Rym: Alright, so maybe they cater to the rich people and they milk all the money out of them.

85
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,859
Rym: They then take that money and do good stuff with it.

86
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,340
Scott: Yeah, you know, I mean, Ted does plenty of good stuff.

87
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,088
Scott: It just, you know, it's like, okay here's a little, we're going to add a little taste of reality, right?

88
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:03,360
Scott: Ted isn't all beautiful and perfect like, you know, people seem to get the impression just from watching talks.

89
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,539
Rym: It doesn't matter though, because all that matters is the content of the talks, really, in the end.

90
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:08,639
Rym: Or most people.

91
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:10,500
Rym: And they're free on the internet.

92
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:12,898
Rym: So, humanity wins.

93
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,349
Rym: It's got, you know, if a Hitler does a good thing for bad reasons, a good thing was still done.

94
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,824
Rym: If a Hitler does a bad thing for a good reason, a bad thing was still done.

95
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,057
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if, you know, how much of this is true or not.

96
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:27,905
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

97
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:29,803
Scott: The point is, is new Teds, they're coming.

98
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:31,642
Rym: Are you sure it was some guy on the internet?

99
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:33,320
Rym: Are you sure it wasn't nothing?

100
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,510
Scott: It was some guy on the internet.

101
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:35,379
Scott: Definitely.

102
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,880
Rym: So that's basically nothing.

103
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:44,376
Rym: So, really quickly, this is an article in the LA Times about fevers that children have.

104
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:46,573
Rym: And apparently there's a problem.

105
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:47,300
Scott: Disco fever?

106
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,065
Rym: That would fix everything.

107
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:57,740
Rym: So, parents apparently will give children fever reducers when they have a fever as low as 97.

108
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,003
Rym: Yeah.

109
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,664
Rym: Which is, by many definitions, not actually a fever.

110
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:05,080
Scott: There are some people who just natural body temperature is just higher.

111
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:10,107
Rym: My body temperature is almost a full degree above, you know, 96.7 most of the time.

112
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:11,702
Scott: Isn't it supposed to be 98.6?

113
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:12,146
Scott: Yeah, 98.

114
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,640
Rym: Whatever the number is, it's about a degree above it.

115
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,020
Scott: 96.7 is a radio station.

116
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:20,731
Rym: I was thinking about unrelated stuff, but I kind of have a high body temperature.

117
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:27,640
Rym: And when I was a kid, a lot of times I'd get my temperature taken at like a nurse's office or a temporary daycare or a kindergarten.

118
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,224
Rym: They'd be like...

119
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:33,100
Scott: It's like, I'm gonna go run around the track and take my temperature after I just set all of this food on fire.

120
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:36,304
Rym: But they'd always be like, "Oh, you've got kind of a fever.

121
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:36,969
Rym: Maybe we should send you

122
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:37,070
Rym: home.".

123
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,533
Rym: I'm like, "No, I'm

124
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:37,775
Rym: fine.".

125
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,231
Rym: But apparently...

126
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,144
Scott: I would've said, "Yeah,

127
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:40,405
Scott: sure.".

128
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:40,931
Scott: The

129
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:52,870
Rym: article's kind of talking about the fact that parents don't actually know what fevers are anymore, and the majority of people really don't realize that if you have a fever and it's not a fever that's high enough to cause, you know, the problems that high fevers cause, like

130
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,970
Scott: death... Like, 99 I think is my line.

131
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,625
Scott: Like, if it's over 99, it's like...

132
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:04,143
Rym: No, but even 100, 101, 102 for short amounts of time, that fever is actually helping your body fight it off.

133
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:06,080
Rym: That's your body reacting to the disease.

134
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,560
Scott: Well, yeah, so is sneezing and coughing.

135
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,220
Rym: Yes, those things are good.

136
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:10,974
Scott: You're still going to take Mucinex.

137
00:09:11,155 --> 00:09:13,034
Rym: It depends on what kind of disease you have.

138
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,509
Scott: You're still going to take the halls of medicine.

139
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:15,115
Rym: No, it depends.

140
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:21,179
Rym: Like, for example, if I have a sinus infection, I want to take the Mucinex because my sinuses are blocked and bacteria are growing in there.

141
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:23,599
Rym: So I need to open it up to get them out.

142
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,320
Rym: But if I have 100, 101 fever because I'm sick, that fever is my body fighting off the illness.

143
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:34,731
Rym: And if I reduce the fever, I'm reducing my body's effectiveness and increasing the duration of the illness.

144
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:38,206
Scott: Yeah, but usually a fever reducer also has anti.

145
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:40,185
Scott: whatever it is you're sick with medicine in it.

146
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:43,175
Rym: No, most fever reducers just treat pain and fever.

147
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:43,720
Scott: Really?

148
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,151
Rym: What do you mean really?

149
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,146
Rym: So what causes fevers?

150
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,240
Rym: Mostly colds and flus.

151
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,043
Scott: Yeah.

152
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:50,173
Rym: What treats colds and flus?

153
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:52,591
Scott: Medicine, Tylenol.

154
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:56,439
Rym: Tylenol does not in any way help you fight off a cold or flu.

155
00:09:57,885 --> 00:09:58,995
Rym: It reduces the symptoms.

156
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:06,900
Scott: It helps you go to sleep and then your body will fight it while you're sleeping and thus you'll be a lot more comfortable.

157
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:12,964
Rym: And it's just kind of telling that people generally don't know much about, well, I don't know anything.

158
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:17,407
Scott: We just need a new thermometer that instead of telling you the degrees, says fever or not fever.

159
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:21,375
Scott: And if you have a fever, it plays Fever from Dr.

160
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:21,640
Scott: Mario.

161
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,495
Scott: And then you play Dr.

162
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:27,834
Scott: Mario instead of taking a fever reducer.

163
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,651
Scott: That way you'll be ignoring your discomfort.

164
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,731
Rym: It also needs to tell you what kind of fever.

165
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:33,105
Rym: Like, is it a normal fever?

166
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:34,340
Rym: A dangerous fever?

167
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:35,660
Scott: There's only three kinds.

168
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:37,170
Rym: Most dangerous fever?

169
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,097
Scott: There's only three kinds.

170
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:38,818
Scott: Red, blue and yellow.

171
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,020
Rym: Things of the day.

172
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,919
Rym: I was born in Detroit.

173
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,303
Rym: I'm a Michigander by blood.

174
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:54,030
Rym: That's where I was born.

175
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,850
Rym: That's my kind of home grounds.

176
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:58,450
Rym: I still root for the red wings.

177
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,749
Rym: I still root for the pistons.

178
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,488
Rym: I still pray for the lions.

179
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:06,585
Rym: Detroit, it's not looking so good.

180
00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:09,613
Rym: Detroit has had some trouble for, I don't know, the last 30, 40 years.

181
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,987
Rym: And one of the most important things about Detroit is its statues.

182
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:24,562
Rym: I mean, we have the Spirit of Detroit, which is this beautiful statue of, it's kind of like the Statue of Liberty, but it's the Spirit of Detroit.

183
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:25,310
Scott: It's not that big.

184
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,380
Scott: It's pretty big, actually.

185
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:27,453
Scott: It's not a Statue of Liberty big.

186
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:28,322
Rym: No, but it's pretty big.

187
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:32,729
Rym: And when we won, when the red wings won the Stanley Cup, I shouldn't say we, because I did not win the Stanley Cup.

188
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:41,410
Rym: When the red wings won the Stanley Cup in '96, someone made a gigantic jersey for the red wings and somehow put it on that statue.

189
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,304
Scott: Well, they also put tiger's jerseys on there, too.

190
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:44,629
Rym: Yeah.

191
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:50,220
Rym: But we also have my favorite statue in all the world, Joe Lewis's fist.

192
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,481
Rym: It's just a giant fist hanging down in front of the Joe Lewis Arena.

193
00:11:54,764 --> 00:12:02,622
Rym: We've got statues, but there's one statue Detroit doesn't have, and I've talked about this, that Robocop, you know, people want to make a Robocop statue in Detroit.

194
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,729
Rym: There's a big project to get the money together to do it.

195
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,281
Rym: Peter Weller has stepped forward and made a pretty fucking awesome video advocating for the Robocop statue.

196
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:15,289
Rym: Peter Weller, if you don't know, played Robocop.

197
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,112
Scott: Yep.

198
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,177
Rym: He is to Robocop what John St.

199
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,269
Rym: John is to Duke Nukem.

200
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:19,731
Scott: Yep.

201
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:23,350
Rym: So, I recommend you watch this, and I donated some money.

202
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:29,856
Rym: Please donate a tiny amount of money, a couple of bucks, to make the life-size, realistic Robocop statue in Detroit.

203
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:36,547
Rym: I think it's a cool nerd internet thing, even though it is kind of a kick in the nuts to people who are living in Detroit.

204
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,913
Rym: I don't know.

205
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:38,479
Rym: It's two ways.

206
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:47,050
Rym: Like, if you live there, or if I still live there, on one hand, you could see the statue of Robocop as being a very cynical, like, yeah, this city sucks idea.

207
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:55,775
Rym: You could also see it for what it is, as kind of a funny joke, like, you know, we do need to deal with this crime problem, and if only we had Robocop.

208
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:57,573
Rym: Like, you could take the good humor in it.

209
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:06,970
Scott: Maybe one day, like, Detroit will revive, and there'll be this Robocop statue, or maybe one day, Detroit will completely disintegrate, and it'll just be a Robocop statue, all alone.

210
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,809
Rym: Look ye mighty upon my works.

211
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,607
Scott: And then Joe Lewis will punch it.

212
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:10,809
Scott: Bam!

213
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:15,829
Rym: I think the most likely scenario is that the Robocop statue will be stolen.

214
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:17,996
Scott: Defaced?

215
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:18,989
Scott: No, you know what?

216
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:20,870
Scott: It'll be wearing a Red Wings jersey.

217
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,509
Rym: [laughter] So what do you got for me?

218
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:28,161
Scott: Uh, so, you know, you ever look out a window before?

219
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:31,070
Rym: Uh, on occasion.

220
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,290
Scott: What do you see out the window?

221
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:34,270
Rym: Right now, I see Manhattan.

222
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,165
Scott: So this means that there are photons coming from Manhattan.

223
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:38,590
Scott: Yep.

224
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:46,786
Scott: And they're coming all the way to your house, across the air, and they're going through the air, and when they get to your window, they're actually going through the glass.

225
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,833
Rym: Yep.

226
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:56,100
Scott: That means there is well, sort of a particle/wave a photon, and it goes through something into your eyeball.

227
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:58,481
Rym: But, I mean, that's not that strange.

228
00:13:58,562 --> 00:14:01,129
Rym: I mean, cosmic rays go through the Earth all the time.

229
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:01,815
Scott: Right, of course.

230
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:02,644
Rym: They go through Earth.

231
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,183
Rym: They go through metal, not just glass.

232
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,910
Scott: Right, but, so glass is a solid object.

233
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:07,757
Rym: So is metal.

234
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:10,281
Scott: Right, but a piece of metal, photons don't go through it.

235
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:12,443
Rym: Alright, but why do cosmic rays go through metal?

236
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:17,009
Scott: That's a very good question, and the answer to both these questions is probably the same answer.

237
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:28,849
Scott: And if you want to know this answer, this video gives a very good scientific explanation of exactly why glass is transparent, and it shows you experiments, it shows you pretty much everything you need to know.

238
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:39,150
Scott: for even a layperson who has knowledge of, if you understand atoms, electrons, protons, and neutrons, then you can understand why things are transparent or translucent.

239
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,138
Rym: You know, I wonder.

240
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,856
Scott: It is quite fascinating, actually.

241
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,390
Rym: I wonder, kind of an aside.

242
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:46,341
Scott: And sort of obvious, I probably should've been able to figure it out, but I didn't.

243
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,038
Rym: Not to sound cynical.

244
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,644
Rym: Maybe I'm just feeling cynical because I'm really, really tired.

245
00:14:51,129 --> 00:15:00,228
Rym: But how many people, like, what percentage of people in the US do you think actually have a reasonable understanding of the classical notions of electrons and atoms?

246
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:02,709
Rym: Like, what percent?

247
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:06,074
Scott: A high estimate, 35%.

248
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:06,969
Rym: I think that's about right.

249
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:07,732
Scott: High.

250
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:09,914
Scott: That's conservatively high.

251
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:11,895
Scott: If I had to lowball it, I'd say, like, 25.

252
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:19,998
Rym: So, this episode was to get to the meta moment recorded in advance because we are, at this moment, on our way to the Penny Arcade Expo in Boston.

253
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:20,970
Scott: Bitch Pax.

254
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:22,358
Rym: Oh, shit.

255
00:15:22,378 --> 00:15:24,458
Rym: Well, Pax East, Pax Boston.

256
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:29,649
Rym: I'll apologize one last time because I'm the one who accidentally caused it to be called Bitch Pax.

257
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,057
Rym: Remember my question?

258
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,239
Rym: I probably should've never asked that question.

259
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:35,794
Scott: That is, you know, it's all on you.

260
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:36,603
Rym: Yeah, it's all on me.

261
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:37,250
Rym: That's my fault.

262
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:37,876
Rym: You can blame me.

263
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:40,889
Rym: But, as a result, you know, we had to get some shows done ahead of time.

264
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:42,990
Rym: So, we are at the Penny Arcade Expo.

265
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,870
Rym: If you are listening to this, hopefully you are on your way and not at home being sad.

266
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:49,312
Rym: If you're at home being sad, just watch the My Little Pony.

267
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:49,837
Rym: You'll feel better.

268
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,110
Scott: Is that for the ponies?

269
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:52,569
Scott: Yeah, the ponies at the show.

270
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:56,705
Scott: Yeah, any other meta things?

271
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:59,858
Rym: The Book Club book is Michio Kaku's Hyperspace, which Scott has not yet read.

272
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:05,916
Rym: We're doing three panels of Pax, game mechanics and mechanism design, how to win at games, and the triple threats, short subjects in gaming.

273
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:12,529
Rym: And the other conventions are Zenkai Con is next weekend and King of Prussia in Pennsylvania near Philadelphia.

274
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,580
Rym: Friday, March 18th, 19th, and 20th.

275
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,716
Rym: We will be doing panels the 19th and the 20th.

276
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,110
Rym: We will not be there Fridays.

277
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,857
Rym: Don't come looking for us.

278
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:20,646
Scott: Are we doing a panel on the 20th?

279
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:22,019
Rym: Uh, yeah, one panel.

280
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:22,524
Rym: Then we're going home.

281
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:23,030
Scott: Oh, okay.

282
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:23,937
Scott: I didn't know we were doing one.

283
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:24,038
Scott: Okay.

284
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:24,482
Scott: We're doing one.

285
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,583
Rym: We're doing Beyond Dungeons and Dragons, the remake.

286
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:27,150
Rym: Exciting.

287
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:28,260
Scott: Yeah.

288
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:29,898
Rym: We are also going to be at Anime Boston.

289
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:30,850
Rym: We'll also be at the Mocha.

290
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,403
Rym: We're doing panels at Anime Boston.

291
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:34,129
Rym: We're just walking around and looking around at the Mocha.

292
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:40,286
Rym: And I'm talking really fast to try to counter the slow version of the meta moment that Scott usually does.

293
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:44,986
Scott: Except for the 10-1.

294
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:50,200
Rym: So BK.

295
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:51,210
Scott: Yeah.

296
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:55,720
Scott: So BK is this pirate dude and after you, you know, beat what's his name?

297
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,350
Rym: Nine pirates.

298
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,738
Scott: Nine pirates.

299
00:16:58,263 --> 00:16:58,909
Scott: And what's the town?

300
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,450
Rym: I don't remember.

301
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,536
Scott: I don't remember.

302
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,243
Scott: I really don't remember.

303
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:05,295
Rym: It starts with a P. Provoca.

304
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:05,921
Rym: Provoca.

305
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:10,809
Scott: So after you go to Provoke Rym and his nine pirates, BK comes out of the booth.

306
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,840
Rym: I can't believe we've never done a throwaway show on fucking bikes.

307
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:19,315
Scott: I thought, you know, we must have because biking is pretty much our number one athletic activity here.

308
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:27,598
Rym: Well, it's the number one athletic activity that is shared between me and Scott because I run and ski and play tennis and rock climb and Scott bikes.

309
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:28,144
Rym: Yeah.

310
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:28,468
Rym: Yeah.

311
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:29,860
Rym: Well, no, no.

312
00:17:30,244 --> 00:17:32,284
Rym: You play FPSs and DDR.

313
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:32,850
Rym: Those are sports.

314
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:33,496
Rym: Jungle speed.

315
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,101
Rym: Athletics.

316
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:35,889
Rym: Jungle speed should be an Olympic event.

317
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,439
Scott: I mean, look, if the biathlon can be in the Olympics, jungle speed can be in the Olympics.

318
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,370
Rym: One thing that amazes me.

319
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:43,300
Rym: We'll get right into it.

320
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,049
Rym: We're talking about bikes.

321
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:55,214
Rym: I feel like most of the people I've known in my entire life who have ridden bikes or not ridden bikes have no idea how bikes actually work or how to ride them properly.

322
00:17:55,274 --> 00:18:00,101
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, a lot of people like when I was kids, it was pretty much you biked around the neighborhood.

323
00:18:00,202 --> 00:18:00,909
Scott: That's what kids did.

324
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:01,334
Rym: Yeah.

325
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:02,850
Rym: But you biked around on a 10 speed.

326
00:18:03,111 --> 00:18:03,272
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:04,708
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, not at first.

328
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:08,302
Scott: I mean, not when I was way little, but as soon as I could fit on one right.

329
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:09,010
Scott: 24 inch or whatever.

330
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,393
Scott: Yeah.

331
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,184
Scott: Yeah.

332
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:15,818
Scott: And then even though it was like it was usually like a huffy or whatever because your parents are going to buy you something nice unless you're actually into biking.

333
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:16,747
Scott: But it didn't matter.

334
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,004
Scott: You can go around the neighborhood in the huffy.

335
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:18,429
Scott: No problem.

336
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,343
Scott: Didn't make you know.

337
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:27,415
Scott: And the thing is everybody knew how to ride a bike because we all did it every day to go to each other's houses in the neighborhood.

338
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,576
Scott: Some kids even rode their bikes to school.

339
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,990
Scott: It's just something everyone knew.

340
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:36,910
Scott: But now it's sort of weird that I'm an adult and there's a lot of people that I know who don't know how to ride a bike.

341
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,899
Scott: And it's like, what?

342
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,467
Scott: It's like every kid in my whole town who had to ride a bike.

343
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:42,264
Scott: So what town are you from?

344
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:51,333
Rym: Yeah, we won't name any names, but I could name a lot of people that I know and people I've met who like didn't realize how to brake, for example.

345
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:54,970
Rym: People don't realize that you're only supposed to use your front brake 99 percent of the time.

346
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:58,383
Rym: The rear brake is really only there to slow down around turns.

347
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:02,770
Rym: Maybe if you're going downhill, like a very steep downhill, and you don't want to flip over the handlebar.

348
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:07,290
Rym: Or if the front brake isn't enough, you can use it to augment the front brake.

349
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,756
Rym: You use it to control speed, like the rear brake you'll touch to like slow down a little bit if you need to.

350
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,070
Rym: But if you actually need to stop, you pretty much need to slam the front brake.

351
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:21,310
Scott: And I mean, especially if you go, you know, because it's like all the weight of you sitting on the bike is going to be on that front tire.

352
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:36,341
Scott: So if you, you know, it's either a friction against the ground is, you know, how much force is being pushed down on the ground and then the coat, depending on the material of the pavement under you or whatever it is, and the tire, right, that is what determines your stopping power.

353
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:41,816
Scott: So if your weight is on the front tire, there's not a lot of weight on the rear tire, there won't be a lot of friction on the rear tire.

354
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:45,050
Scott: So hitting the brakes on it isn't going to slow you down all that much.

355
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:50,060
Rym: Never mind the lever action of the bike that as you brake, you lean forward pulling weight off the rear tire.

356
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:55,989
Rym: That's why if you you can lock your rear brake, but you can't lock your front brake without flipping over the handlebars.

357
00:19:57,353 --> 00:20:02,170
Rym: That's the other thing, I see a lot of people just holding down the rear brake and just skidding to a stop, ruining their tire.

358
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,661
Rym: Yeah, I mean an optimal brake in a bike is if you really need to stop in time your rear wheel should actually lift up off the ground about an inch.

359
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:11,749
Rym: That means that you have broken optimally.

360
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:20,429
Scott: The other thing is that, you know, cars have anti-lock brakes, right, and people I think have been, you know, anti-lock brakes have actually been around for a long time now.

361
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:27,702
Scott: And I think a lot of people, because even in cars, right, you basically just, you just slam on the brakes these days.

362
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:29,803
Scott: And that's what you should do in a car with anti-lock brakes.

363
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,741
Scott: It's pretty much just slam on them if you need to, right?

364
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:43,964
Scott: But in the olden days, before they had anti-lock brakes, people actually had to learn how to brake properly where if the tire is locked up, you let go of the brake because you want, you know, you want them basically to roll, but you want them to roll more slowly to stop.

365
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:49,237
Scott: If you just lock the tires up, then suddenly you can't control the turning of the car at all.

366
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:50,390
Scott: You're completely out of control.

367
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:57,115
Scott: It's just, whatever, you know, momentum you have and, you know, the friction of the tires against the road, that's pretty much all you got.

368
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:01,415
Rym: But bikes, people just, like, you gotta pulse them, just like you used to in old cars.

369
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:05,518
Scott: Yeah, the tires shouldn't stop rotating until you're actually stop-stopped.

370
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,975
Rym: I use a kind of pattern when I need to stop, where I slam on the front brake, and then I pulse it alternatingly with the rear brake as I slow down, like I tend to go and

371
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:21,799
Scott: I hold it down as hard as I need to hold it down, and if it's, you know, I can tell if it's about to lock up soon, and I let go, and then I go on it again, like, check it

372
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,617
Rym: out, check it out, check it out.

373
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:27,718
Scott: So I'm always trying to get the maximum braking power out of it without a lock up.

374
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:35,275
Rym: People don't seem to realize too, that if your brakes get wet, you need to, you know, tap them a little bit to clean them off so they'll be ready to go.

375
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:40,750
Rym: Like, if you go through a puddle of some mud, you gotta hold them down just a little bit to warm them up and get all the water on.

376
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,090
Scott: Well, unless you have, what's it called, disc brakes.

377
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,638
Rym: I actually didn't get disc brakes on my fancy bike.

378
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,022
Scott: Me either.

379
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:50,950
Rym: I could've, but they really, they're really only useful for mountain biking, I've decided.

380
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,456
Rym: They're not really useful for even pretty advanced street biking.

381
00:21:53,739 --> 00:22:01,517
Scott: Yeah, it's like you don't see, like, who do you see using actual disc brakes for any actual, I always try to look at the professional biking people, not because I ever Mountain bikers.

382
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,430
Scott: Not because I'm ever going to be them, but just to see what equipment they're using.

383
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,618
Rym: Professional mountain bikers.

384
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:13,535
Scott: Because that's how you can tell between what's a gimmick thing, right, that's just something they're trying to sell you at the bike shop, and what's actually legitimately going to help you.

385
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:16,990
Rym: Well, the disc brakes won't let you stop faster, necessarily, on smooth ground.

386
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,810
Scott: All I'm saying, Lance Armstrong doesn't have disc brakes.

387
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:24,201
Scott: He has these, he has the brakes that are, they're much fancier than the brakes that I've got, but they're the same basic mechanisms.

388
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:33,738
Rym: But the difference is the main advantage of these brakes, and if I ever get a better mountain bike, I'll get disc brakes on it, is that if you go through a whole bunch of mud, their effectiveness is basically not diminished.

389
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,142
Scott: Nope.

390
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:38,466
Scott: And also, I mean, mud could, I guess, theoretically get in there, but that's not like...

391
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:45,514
Rym: More importantly, if your frame gets, you know, if the bike tires themselves get deformed, it won't hurt the braking ability either.

392
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:53,676
Rym: And, they disperse heat better, so say you need to, like mountain biking, a big thing you need to do is brake almost the whole time you're going down the hill.

393
00:22:53,757 --> 00:22:54,483
Scott: Well, downhill, yeah.

394
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:55,230
Rym: Yeah, downhill mountain biking.

395
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,483
Scott: But it's also the uphill component.

396
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:58,830
Rym: Yeah, but downhill mountain biking, you need to use the brakes a lot.

397
00:22:59,272 --> 00:23:06,320
Rym: And if you've ever been in a car, and you're using the brake to slow your car down down a hill, one, you're ruining your brakes.

398
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:10,949
Rym: Two, you're probably not going to be able to stop for a good like mile or two after you get to the bottom of the hill.

399
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,568
Rym: Bikes are the same way.

400
00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:13,695
Rym: Yeah.

401
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:19,959
Scott: If your brakes are too hot, they're made of rubber, they'll melt, and they'll get all liquidy, and they won't be any good at stopping.

402
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:20,524
Rym: Yep.

403
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:22,504
Rym: People also don't know how to shift.

404
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,040
Rym: They don't use their gears effectively.

405
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:26,181
Scott: Well, I think people don't even, because, you know, that's another thing.

406
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:28,707
Scott: In cars, people don't have manual transmissions anymore.

407
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:31,110
Scott: They have automatic transmissions since forever.

408
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:36,242
Rym: Never mind having two different clutches, like two different sets of gears.

409
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:45,030
Scott: Right, so you know, people don't even know how to, you know, the concept of gears isn't even something that they take into account in their everyday life because they don't, you know, have it in their cars.

410
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,960
Scott: So when it comes to bikes, only actual people who know and care about biking know how to use brakes.

411
00:23:50,001 --> 00:24:00,529
Scott: I can't tell you how many times I'll be going over the bridge, which is the time when you're going to probably, even if you don't care about gear shifting or efficiency, that's the time to, you know, shift gears going over the big hill.

412
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:15,009
Scott: And you see people going over, and like, the biggest gear, and they just push really hard, or they'll just get off, or they'll be using some useless gear that's like, way too low, and they'll just be going as slow as molasses on a cold day, and they'll be pedaling like crazy.

413
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:15,937
Scott: And it's like, "What are you

414
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:16,199
Scott: doing?".

415
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,089
Scott: I'm like, "Dude, shift up.

416
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:17,471
Rym: Come

417
00:24:17,512 --> 00:24:17,633
Rym: on.".

418
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:20,137
Rym: Yep, even worse, you couple that with the push-push.

419
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:21,510
Scott: Oh, the push-push.

420
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:31,310
Rym: Push-push is, most people when they ride bikes, they don't realize it's continuous motion, and they tend to just go push, push, push, like they're stepping on the front of each pedal as it comes around the top.

421
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,582
Scott: Yeah, the bike pedal, right, the gears are circles.

422
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:35,672
Scott: They're not ovals, right?

423
00:24:35,753 --> 00:24:41,210
Scott: So, you need to, you know, when you're pedaling, you want to be pushing and/or pulling up with the other foot.

424
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,746
Scott: That's why people get the toe clips to make it...

425
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:44,866
Rym: I actually, I'm getting some toe clips in the spring.

426
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,200
Scott: To make it easier to pull up.

427
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:49,413
Scott: I'm not a big fan of the clips, just because it's hard to take your foot on and off the pedal.

428
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,917
Rym: Actually, what I'm gonna do, I'm not gonna get the, I'll get the clips.

429
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,110
Rym: You get the shoes that clip on?

430
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:53,716
Rym: I'm gonna get both.

431
00:24:53,736 --> 00:24:57,654
Rym: I'm gonna get the clips for when I'm just like, if I want to take my bike, like, to the store, I can just use the clips.

432
00:24:57,674 --> 00:24:58,746
Rym: Or the, yeah, the toe clips.

433
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:01,150
Scott: But then you gotta keep switching the clips with the foot thing.

434
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:05,753
Rym: Yeah, I'm only gonna use the boots if I'm going on, like, upper, like, I'm going to Beacon or something.

435
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:07,570
Scott: They sell the shoes on Zappos, actually.

436
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:08,120
Rym: Oh, do they?

437
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:08,304
Rym: Yeah.

438
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,887
Scott: So, but anyway, so yeah, it's like, that makes it easier to pull up on the other pedal.

439
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:19,574
Scott: So this, what you want to have, ideally, you know, equal force rotating in a perfect circle at all times, right?

440
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:23,757
Scott: So the gear should be spinning at, you know, sort of a constant RPM.

441
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,725
Scott: So, you know, if you go push one side, then push the other side, it's basically RPM stop, RPM stop, rotate stop, rotate stop.

442
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:33,030
Scott: It's also really hard on your bike.

443
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,410
Scott: It's an oval shape, not a circle shape.

444
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,603
Rym: So, Scott, you're probably not aware, there are.

445
00:25:36,846 --> 00:25:37,230
Scott: It's cycling.

446
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,542
Rym: There was a, this was a trend in the 90s, I think, and I don't know if it ever continued.

447
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:41,917
Scott: To make bikes with oval gears?

448
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:42,706
Scott: Yeah, every now and then you'll see.

449
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:43,030
Scott: It's possible.

450
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:44,139
Rym: Every now and then you'll see.

451
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:45,613
Scott: I don't know how you'd shift an elliptical gear.

452
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:46,502
Rym: Uh, they work just fine.

453
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:47,794
Scott: You could shift the rear gear.

454
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:48,784
Rym: Scott, you're not even letting me finish.

455
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:49,674
Rym: They made these bikes.

456
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:59,977
Rym: They were a gimmick for rich people, and basically they took advantage of the fact that most people push, push, and it was an elliptical gear that would basically use the extra force to round everything out.

457
00:26:00,037 --> 00:26:04,041
Rym: So when your push, push happened was when you had more total torque.

458
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:04,790
Scott: Uh-huh.

459
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,329
Rym: So as a result, you could actually, like it worked really well if you were a push, pusher.

460
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:14,770
Rym: But they were a little overly complex, and they were not easily rideable by people who know how to bike properly.

461
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,510
Rym: And people who buy a ten thousand dollar bike.

462
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:24,770
Scott: Anyone who goes to the store and is looking at a bunch of bikes and one of them has these weird oval gears, I don't think those are going to sell too well.

463
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:29,809
Rym: I think they would, but the people who are going to spend ten thousand dollars on a bike are people who already know how to bike.

464
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,849
Rym: Already care about biking.

465
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:35,269
Scott: Especially if they're more expensive than they're really not going to sell.

466
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,277
Rym: I don't know, I like biking.

467
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:40,085
Rym: We can stop ranting about people not knowing how to ride bikes.

468
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:40,490
Rym: You sure?

469
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,821
Scott: You want to rant about it some more?

470
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:49,174
Scott: I got to at least rant about the fact that in New York City, right, as you know, there's a lot of people who are like biketivists, right?

471
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:51,399
Scott: They're like big activists for biking.

472
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,025
Scott: They're like, you know, share the road.

473
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:58,650
Scott: and hey, people in cars, look out for the bikes, don't hit us with your cars, you assholes.

474
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:00,009
Rym: And I'm a hundred percent for that.

475
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,684
Scott: Yeah, I am also a hundred percent for that.

476
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:03,789
Scott: Bike lanes, sure, bring us some bike lanes.

477
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:09,649
Scott: Don't give bikes the proper right of way and leeway and all the things you need to give them, sure.

478
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:20,230
Scott: But the fact is this, last year I rode my bike to work, you know, all the days it was warm and after I get back from PAX it'll probably be warm again and I'll probably resume.

479
00:27:21,554 --> 00:27:26,529
Scott: Most of the people I saw being assholes and not doing what they should be doing are the people on the bikes.

480
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:27,518
Scott: Yep.

481
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:32,713
Scott: I rarely saw cars, you know, the cars really didn't want to hit the people on the bikes if they saw them, right?

482
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:37,258
Rym: I have been hit by more bicyclists than I have by any other thing in New York.

483
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:41,159
Scott: But in terms of, you know, people on bikes, I have seen tons of assholery.

484
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,110
Scott: Pretty much no one obeys red lights or stop signs or anything unless they definitely have to when there's a car coming.

485
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,210
Rym: The other day, another guy just slammed into me.

486
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,441
Rym: I was walking and he just hit me.

487
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:56,450
Scott: Yeah, sometimes even if they do respect the red light, instead of stopping, they'll sort of bike in a circle because they don't want to stop moving.

488
00:27:56,792 --> 00:28:02,530
Scott: So they'll sort of circle around a bit until the green light comes, then they'll go instead of just stopping and putting their foot on the ground.

489
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:05,199
Scott: Is it like, is their bike too high for them to put their foot on the ground?

490
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:05,825
Scott: They can't stop?

491
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:06,249
Scott: I don't know.

492
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:06,694
Scott: Yep.

493
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:10,453
Scott: Some, a lot of them will drive the stupid bikes without brakes.

494
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,150
Scott: I think I've complained about that on the show before.

495
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:12,471
Scott: Yep.

496
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:15,180
Rym: A lot of the people who circle, if you look, they're almost always fixies.

497
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:16,210
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

498
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:19,202
Rym: Because it's hard for them to get going again because you know what, fixies suck.

499
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:19,709
Scott: They do.

500
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,910
Rym: There's no reason to use a fixie in the modern world.

501
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,710
Rym: They're not that much more reliable.

502
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,593
Scott: No, it's not.

503
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:25,845
Scott: I don't think it's about reliability.

504
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:27,119
Scott: I think for some people it's about style.

505
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,889
Rym: No, they always argue it is, though.

506
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,190
Rym: They always argue that, hey, my fixie never breaks.

507
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,030
Scott: My bike didn't break either.

508
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:38,029
Scott: But I've never actually argued with anyone who has a fixie, but I think they do it for style or they just don't care or don't know.

509
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:43,850
Scott: They just go and they buy a bike and they don't care about... People don't care about the under the hood stuff.

510
00:28:44,132 --> 00:28:49,363
Scott: It's like the same reason you'd buy an Apple computer as opposed to... You look at the outside of it.

511
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:50,350
Scott: They don't look at the inside.

512
00:28:50,993 --> 00:28:55,160
Scott: The gearing and that stuff is inside secret science-y stuff.

513
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:58,756
Scott: They're looking at the color of the paint job and whether there's a basket in the front.

514
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:07,427
Rym: One thing I can say, though, is that biking has pretty much been the sport that I have engaged in and the athleticism I have done more than anything else in my entire life.

515
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:10,536
Rym: I've been biking for pretty much as long as I've been able to bike.

516
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:14,295
Rym: I've had a litany of mountain bikes and road bikes and everything.

517
00:29:14,476 --> 00:29:19,546
Scott: It might have been swimming, but I pretty much stopped swimming once I left my parents.

518
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,283
Rym: In high school, that was when it really peaked.

519
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:24,073
Rym: Every single day, I just get on my bike and ride off.

520
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:26,942
Rym: I'd ride 50, 60 miles just wherever.

521
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:28,215
Rym: I'd go down to Detroit and back.

522
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:29,370
Rym: I'd go out to the lakes.

523
00:29:30,274 --> 00:29:37,269
Rym: A couple of times, I'd bike out and it'd be 11 o'clock on a Wednesday and I'd realize that I'm a couple hours from home.

524
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,427
Scott: For me, it was like biking and swimming with.

525
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:45,124
Scott: biking was ahead a bit, but then eventually another bike was stolen and then it was just like,

526
00:29:45,144 --> 00:29:45,469
Scott: "Alright.".

527
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:51,490
Scott: I never got a new one until RIT, but then I stopped swimming when I went to college.

528
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:56,258
Scott: It was biking and then swimming took the lead and then biking again.

529
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,309
Scott: I haven't swimmed again.

530
00:29:58,514 --> 00:29:59,404
Rym: Well, I started.

531
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:03,810
Rym: actually when I lived in the mountains, biking was nothing other than a hobby.

532
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,001
Rym: It was nothing but a way to have fun on a bike and exercise.

533
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:09,990
Scott: Once you're in the city, it can actually become legitimate transportation again.

534
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,390
Rym: Actually, in Beacon, it was legitimate transportation.

535
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:12,680
Rym: I'd go to the farmer's market.

536
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:13,690
Rym: I'd go to the train station.

537
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:18,436
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it's not like the city where you can go anywhere with it.

538
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:21,546
Rym: Yeah, I can bike anywhere in the city almost faster than the subway.

539
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:22,698
Rym: It'll get me there in many cases.

540
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,517
Scott: Yeah, I can get to work.

541
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:25,830
Scott: The thing is, it depends, right?

542
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:27,970
Scott: Can I go faster than the subway?

543
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:45,370
Scott: No, not really, but considering the fact that I can leave my house directly, take a shorter path than the subway, and I won't have to wait for the train to show up, you know, it sort of evens out depending on where you're going, especially if you're going somewhere that's a little bit far away from a station, because you can definitely make up for that walking time easily.

544
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:49,569
Scott: And you can take all sorts of paths that you would normally not be able to go.

545
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,482
Rym: I do have the advantage that my work is Grand Central, so I basically just bike.

546
00:30:53,522 --> 00:30:54,209
Rym: It's like right there.

547
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,250
Scott: Yeah, mine is across town a bit.

548
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,367
Rym: I mean, I can rollerblade to work efficiently if I want to.

549
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:03,449
Rym: Of course, my building's being stupid and they won't let me bring my bike in.

550
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:04,823
Scott: Yeah, my building.

551
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:07,048
Rym: They found a loophole in the law and they're just being dicks about it.

552
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,729
Scott: Can't they let you in at the correct hours?

553
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:16,681
Rym: Yeah, at the correct hours, which they made sure were, basically the hours start after I get to work and end before I leave work.

554
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:20,055
Rym: And they're like, "If you have to stay late, well, you can't bring your bike down past your

555
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:20,237
Rym: elevator.".

556
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:26,259
Scott: Well, mine is the same way, except the hours are an hour before I get to work, and an hour ends at six.

557
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,130
Rym: Yeah, my hours are basically useless.

558
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:33,789
Scott: The thing is, if I stay there at six, I have to go get on the subway to go home.

559
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,412
Rym: Yep.

560
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:44,781
Rym: What I might do is, because I got my fancy road bike, which is, as much as I am into biking, it is way more aggressively geared than I am capable of taking advantage of.

561
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:49,168
Rym: That's one of the reasons why I need the tote clips, because I can't take advantage of the bike as it is.

562
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,669
Rym: I can't even use the highest gears.

563
00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:53,269
Rym: I'm not strong enough.

564
00:31:54,138 --> 00:31:54,468
Rym: I'm not.

565
00:31:55,473 --> 00:31:56,990
Rym: It's kind of amazing, but I love this bike.

566
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,410
Scott: I've never been on a bike where I couldn't pedal every gear in the right situation.

567
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:09,410
Scott: Obviously, I can't use the highest gear from a standstill on an uphill, but I've never been on a bike where I couldn't use the highest gear going downhill.

568
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,523
Rym: You should try riding my bike.

569
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:13,289
Scott: I got all those tiny, tiny little gears.

570
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,690
Scott: What is it, like the size of a dime?

571
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:18,144
Rym: The smallest one is like that.

572
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:21,936
Scott: If I'm going downhill on the bridge, I could use it.

573
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:28,850
Rym: Going downhill on the bridge, I was two gears away from that, and I was basically pedaling at my maximal capacity.

574
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:31,390
Rym: I couldn't push that other gear anymore.

575
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:32,789
Rym: Unless I push pushed.

576
00:32:34,197 --> 00:32:34,769
Scott: You don't want to do that.

577
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:41,329
Rym: But I think what I'm going to do is I got that old mountain bike, that like 15 year old mountain bike that I got back.

578
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:42,988
Scott: That was stolen.

579
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,058
Rym: That was stolen.

580
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:45,149
Rym: I little macked it.

581
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:50,501
Rym: And basically I think I'm going to fix it up, and it's not the greatest bike anymore.

582
00:32:50,582 --> 00:32:54,020
Rym: I would not take it for real mountain biking, because I think the suspension would just break.

583
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:55,394
Scott: I think you'd probably get hurt.

584
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:58,790
Rym: But I think what I'll do is I can ride it to work, and park it outside.

585
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:01,915
Rym: And if someone steals it in the city, alright.

586
00:33:02,037 --> 00:33:04,362
Scott: You can pay to get a bike locker in Grand Central, I think.

587
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:05,352
Scott: This place is in there.

588
00:33:05,372 --> 00:33:08,350
Rym: I'll have to look, but the thing is, this bike is 15 years old.

589
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:10,284
Rym: And it was already stolen.

590
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:12,690
Rym: I had already given up on having that bike.

591
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,989
Rym: The fact that I have it was just happenstance.

592
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,230
Rym: So if it gets stolen again, whatever.

593
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:17,858
Scott: Yep.

594
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,222
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is, alright, so you do that, it'll get stolen immediately, and then...

595
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:23,150
Rym: I don't think it will.

596
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:25,050
Rym: It looks pretty shitty at this point.

597
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:25,715
Rym: It does.

598
00:33:25,775 --> 00:33:29,350
Scott: I mean, how often do people have the delivery guys get their bikes stolen?

599
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:30,907
Rym: I don't think they do that often.

600
00:33:30,947 --> 00:33:32,169
Rym: I think people steal the nice bikes.

601
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:37,210
Scott: Speaking of bike thievery, right, in the city, bike locks become a big issue.

602
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:41,070
Scott: It's like, do you go with the big crazy chain situation?

603
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,774
Rym: Well, as I've learned, big crazy chain is about a five minute hacksaw job.

604
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:49,370
Scott: Right, but the other thing with the big crazy chain is that it's so heavy.

605
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,714
Scott: You gotta carry that if you're gonna use it.

606
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:56,198
Rym: I got a really nice, just kinda normal key lock with the cable and then the metal inside the cable.

607
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,683
Rym: Yeah.

608
00:33:56,986 --> 00:34:00,479
Scott: I got one of those U things that has some sort of insurance and such like that.

609
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,622
Scott: And it, you know, it's like, you gotta make sure, though, that you, like, you put it through all the tires and all that.

610
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,748
Scott: And there's some people, like, they take their seats with them.

611
00:34:07,432 --> 00:34:11,330
Rym: I would do that on my old bike, because remember, my new bike, like, the seat is just the default seat.

612
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,117
Rym: It's a generic seat.

613
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:17,472
Rym: On my mountain bike, the seat that that jackass who stole my bike cut up to try to disguise it, that was like a $180 bike seat.

614
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:17,634
Rym: Oh, wow.

615
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:22,261
Rym: That was a really fancy, like, ergonomic seat that I really like.

616
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:28,098
Scott: So it's like you gotta take the front tire off, then you gotta put the lock through both tires and the frame, and then you gotta remove this.

617
00:34:28,118 --> 00:34:32,241
Rym: You don't need to take the front tire off if you have a long enough chain to go through all the bits.

618
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:34,563
Scott: Yeah, if you're doing the chain mode, but if you're doing the U mode.

619
00:34:34,603 --> 00:34:35,775
Rym: Yeah, that's why I don't like the U.

620
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:36,119
Scott: Yeah.

621
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:42,342
Scott: Actually, there's one guy, right, he, uh, if you have, like, a really crappy bike, what you could do is they make these tiny U's.

622
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:45,170
Scott: Like, the really, it's like the tiniest U. you can put it in your pocket.

623
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:50,259
Scott: So it's like, and what you can do is they also have these other things that are basically these wheel locks.

624
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:57,776
Scott: So the way they work is, you know how when you wanna, you know, on a quick take off your wheels, there's a little thing, the lever, you pull the lever and you spin the screw and you take your wheel off?

625
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:58,018
Scott: Yep.

626
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,836
Rym: You know, Emily's old bike doesn't have that.

627
00:34:59,937 --> 00:35:01,490
Rym: I was, I was gonna change your tire the other day.

628
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,361
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't have the quick release.

629
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:03,332
Rym: I reached out and I'm like, "What the

630
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:03,514
Rym: fuck?".

631
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,595
Rym: Then I look and it's just a bolt, and I'm like, "God damn

632
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:05,717
Rym: it.".

633
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:06,930
Rym: I had to go get, like, a wrench.

634
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:07,837
Scott: Old style.

635
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:08,382
Scott: Yeah.

636
00:35:08,664 --> 00:35:13,756
Scott: But what they have is you can actually replace the quick release mechanism with this locking quick release mechanism.

637
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:14,827
Scott: Ah.

638
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:22,867
Scott: And I'm not, I don't know how well it works, but supposedly the way this thing works is that you can only, it's just normal, it looks like a normal quick release.

639
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:29,373
Scott: You don't notice anything, but it actually won't quick release at all unless you turn the bike upside down.

640
00:35:30,343 --> 00:35:30,444
Scott: Ah.

641
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:35,535
Scott: So no one can, it basically prevents your tires from being removed if the bike is right side up.

642
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:45,470
Scott: So if you, if you trust in that system, then you can use the tiniest, tiniest U-lock and just lock the frame to something like a bar or anything, right?

643
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:53,069
Scott: Just get the frame on something, don't worry about the tires, take the seat with you, and I think they even have one for the seat quick release also.

644
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:53,691
Scott: Ah.

645
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:54,035
Scott: Right?

646
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:10,986
Scott: So no one, if you get all three quick releases, the seat and the two tires with this thing and you lock your bike to something with a tiny U-lock right side up, then you can just carry around the tiniest lock, and if you trust it, then you're, and it works, then you're in business, right?

647
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,070
Scott: Without having to carry anything big nor heavy.

648
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:13,531
Rym: Yup.

649
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:17,773
Scott: I'm looking though, cause we're, cause no one can turn the bike upside down to take the things off.

650
00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:18,581
Rym: What I might do.

651
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:19,733
Scott: You can't bust the tiny U.

652
00:36:19,753 --> 00:36:23,210
Rym: It looks like for homeowners insurance, I can add on, basically, bike insurance.

653
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:29,370
Scott: My homeowner, my homeowner already covers the bicycle, or like, if I get a camera stolen on the subway, it covers all that.

654
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,363
Rym: Yeah, cause my bike is pretty, I got a really nice bike.

655
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:32,869
Scott: Yeah.

656
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:36,080
Scott: You didn't get like the really nice bike.

657
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:43,555
Rym: I got basically the highest end of the, like, I'm one step under where you start replacing like the front fork with carbon fiber.

658
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:45,615
Scott: Yeah, that's, that's really nice.

659
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:46,282
Scott: That's what I'm talking about.

660
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:47,717
Rym: I'm one step below that.

661
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:48,061
Rym: Yeah.

662
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:48,870
Rym: I'm like persumer.

663
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:55,454
Scott: Yeah, the thing is that, you know, I gotta, I wanna go somewhere and like try out some of the actual street kinda bikes.

664
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:56,888
Rym: The racing bikes, they're not comfortable.

665
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:57,554
Rym: I don't enjoy them.

666
00:36:57,695 --> 00:37:00,441
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, I've never actually ridden one for any extended period of time.

667
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:03,110
Rym: Scott, if you wanna go long distances and you wanna upgrade your bike, get mine.

668
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:03,712
Scott: Eh.

669
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,341
Rym: My bike is comfortable like yours, but it's fast.

670
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:07,210
Scott: It's not significantly different.

671
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,301
Rym: Yeah, it is actually.

672
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:12,909
Rym: Scott, one, you have much wider tires than me and much bigger rims, like wider rims.

673
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,746
Scott: That doesn't make that much of a difference.

674
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:18,038
Rym: Actually, it makes a huge difference for long-term speed and energy efficiency.

675
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:20,501
Rym: If you're going a long distance, your tires are way too wide.

676
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:24,020
Scott: Yeah, but if I go get a street bike, the tires are gonna be way even thinner than yours.

677
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,769
Scott: Yours aren't that thin.

678
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,121
Rym: Yeah, 'cause mine's a hybrid.

679
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:26,789
Rym: It's between the two.

680
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,654
Scott: I can go, see the thing is, my gears are different.

681
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,594
Rym: My, like, the seat arrangement's a little different.

682
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:38,622
Scott: I'll go and I'll, you know, I'm gonna go test out those kind of bikes and if I can deal with it, you know, in maybe a year or two, I will go when this bike is sort of done.

683
00:37:38,643 --> 00:37:47,029
Rym: Honestly, Scott, really, those street bikes, like street racing bikes are only worth it if you're going to race or if you are planning to, like, yeah, I'm gonna bike up to Albany this weekend.

684
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:48,499
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

685
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,025
Scott: You never know.

686
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:56,624
Rym: Yeah, I mean, you might, if you go down that road, yeah, you definitely want a street bike, but I'm just saying, unless you're doing that, you pretty much just want to get a better hybrid instead.

687
00:37:56,644 --> 00:38:04,449
Scott: The thing is, I see most of the people in the city, right, they, they're all, like, the popular thing these days are like these, like, Euro pixies that everyone drives.

688
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,337
Scott: Oh, whatever.

689
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:14,870
Scott: You know, it's like, I always complain about the people with the track bikes, but actually the most popular bike are, like, these hipster, they get, like, these Bianchi frames with, like, it's like, oh, really?

690
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,981
Scott: It's like, everyone freaking rides these things.

691
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:19,133
Scott: I don't understand them.

692
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:21,741
Scott: But meanwhile, the delivery guys, right, what do they ride?

693
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:24,368
Scott: They ride basically, like, mountain bikes from Toys R Us.

694
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:24,893
Rym: Yeah.

695
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:27,800
Scott: That are all beat up in a mishmash of random pieces.

696
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:33,213
Rym: Well, I'll admit I miss, like, I like my bike because for riding in the city, like, it's way faster than a mountain bike.

697
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:36,610
Rym: But I miss having the tank capabilities of a mountain bike.

698
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:46,589
Rym: I miss the fact that on my mountain bike, I could just, like, ram into the curb if I wanted to with no effect, just, like, suddenly be on the sidewalk, run over, like, anything I run over doesn't even faze me.

699
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:47,093
Rym: Yeah.

700
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:48,608
Rym: With this bike, like, a pothole.

701
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:49,779
Scott: You hit a bump, you're like, ah!

702
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:52,024
Rym: Yeah, a pothole on my bike is a big fucking deal.

703
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:52,450
Scott: Yeah.

704
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:57,997
Scott: I kind of actually, you know, after watching the videos of that downhill urban, uh, biking, you know.

705
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,679
Rym: You want to do that kind of mountain biking?

706
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:00,710
Scott: If I wasn't going to die.

707
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,969
Rym: We could rent mountain bikes and go out and do it.

708
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,830
Scott: Yeah, where are we going to find a place that's like that?

709
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,634
Rym: There's a ton of mountain biking trails up by Bear Mountain.

710
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:09,089
Scott: No, I'm not talking about a city on a hill.

711
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:13,920
Rym: There's got, just downhill, there's downhill courses in the woods that are the same basic thing.

712
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:14,730
Scott: Oh, that's nice in the woods.

713
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,840
Scott: I want to do it in the city with the stairs, and the street, and the, you know.

714
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,396
Scott: Do you know, have you ever done anything like that?

715
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:19,860
Scott: No.

716
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,354
Rym: Have you ever done, like, stunt biking?

717
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:21,919
Rym: Jumping?

718
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,222
Rym: Anything?

719
00:39:22,242 --> 00:39:22,282
Rym: No.

720
00:39:22,585 --> 00:39:23,090
Rym: You would die.

721
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:24,244
Scott: I know, that's why.

722
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:24,590
Scott: You would die.

723
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:26,469
Scott: I got to do, like, a little one first.

724
00:39:27,153 --> 00:39:30,169
Rym: You got to at least ride on bikes with suspensions first to get used to that shit.

725
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,470
Scott: I had a bike with a suspension, but it was only the front suspension.

726
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,910
Rym: Yeah, you need the, a mountain bike, full body suspension is way different.

727
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:40,109
Rym: Like, some of the bikes I've tried, I didn't buy them because they cost more than my car.

728
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:44,270
Rym: You could basically jump out that window right there on the bike, land on the ground, and be fine.

729
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,370
Scott: Oh, I see guys do that on YouTube all the time.

730
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,130
Scott: Well, I guess if you land tires first.

731
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,038
Rym: Yeah, you got to land tires first.

732
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:52,250
Rym: Not head first.

733
00:39:53,250 --> 00:40:02,469
Scott: You know, whether you, what part of the bike hits the ground first is up to your skill, and the bike, no bike, it doesn't matter what bike you're using, you're not going to be saved.

734
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:12,083
Rym: I do enjoy mountain biking, and it's one of the few hobbies that I love that I just stopped doing, and I really, I think this summer, I got to go up to, like, Hunter Mountain or something, just go mountain biking again.

735
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:12,769
Scott: Man, you know what I like?

736
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,196
Scott: Tricycles.

737
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:15,115
Scott: Tricycles are the shit.

738
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:17,657
Scott: You get your little red wagon, you pull it around.

739
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:18,630
Rym: I prefer bicycles.

740
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:21,986
Scott: You pull it around, your little red wagon, with your stuffed animals in it.

741
00:40:22,006 --> 00:40:22,209
Rym: Monocycles.

742
00:40:23,976 --> 00:40:27,408
Scott: Yeah, the monocycles was really popular at RIT, but I haven't really, uh...

743
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,885
Rym: Well, because the Juggling Club was really big with the Unicycle Club.

744
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:32,522
Rym: I think they were eventually the same club.

745
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:33,129
Scott: I don't know.

746
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,943
Rym: There was always those guys that were taking unicycles.

747
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:35,570
Scott: There was a lot of crossover.

748
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:38,401
Rym: I saw a guy taking a unicycle over the bridge the other day.

749
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:38,926
Rym: Really?

750
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:39,977
Rym: Yeah, when I was rollerblading.

751
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,239
Scott: I haven't seen that many unicycles in the city.

752
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,430
Rym: Because they're not fast.

753
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,310
Rym: They're not practical for long distances.

754
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:53,010
Scott: I see a lot, what I do see is I see a lot of delivery guys of, like, the battery-powered bicycles, but they're not, like, fancy, they're, like, the ghettoist battery-powered bike you'll ever see.

755
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,769
Rym: Actually, my stepdad, he was really good at unicycles.

756
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,340
Rym: He had a whole bunch.

757
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:01,450
Rym: Like, little one, big one, he had one that was, like, ten feet tall.

758
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:01,995
Scott: What?

759
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:02,789
Scott: How could you even get on it?

760
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:03,552
Rym: A ladder?

761
00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:05,830
Rym: Basically, you run with it like it's a pole vault.

762
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,481
Rym: You plant the tires sideways like it's a pole vault.

763
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:14,502
Scott: Oh, so because the thing the tire's on, you can bring it down and grab the seat because it swings all the way, yeah.

764
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:22,338
Rym: Well, the tires at the bottom, there's a long pole, there's a seat at the top, and there's a long chain thing and that, like, connects to the pedals which are way at the top.

765
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:25,610
Rym: So he pole vaults up and then jumps onto the seat and then starts going.

766
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:27,289
Rym: Or falls over.

767
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,449
Scott: Oh, so you don't just grab, so the seat, you don't bring the seat down to where you are?

768
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:31,812
Scott: No!

769
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:32,520
Scott: Oh, okay.

770
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,237
Scott: You pole vault up and then you start going.

771
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:41,937
Scott: I thought you would bring the seat down to where you are, sort of put it near the front of you, run, and as you're running, sort of put it under your butt and swing up there, like that.

772
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,190
Rym: Uh, Scott, try to picture what that would look like.

773
00:41:45,431 --> 00:41:50,967
Rym: You basically are taking a pole vault, putting the nub of it in your junk and running full speed and planting it.

774
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,831
Scott: Yeah.

775
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,978
Rym: That's not a good idea.

776
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:58,019
Scott: You're more like jumping up, you know, ten feet while holding onto it.

777
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,070
Rym: Scott, can you jump ten feet?

778
00:41:59,350 --> 00:41:59,504
Rym: Nope.

779
00:42:02,693 --> 00:42:06,221
Rym: I like recumbent bikes, but I'd have no practical use for one.

780
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:08,504
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, I like the idea of it.

781
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:10,866
Scott: I'm sure it's, I guarantee it's really comfortable.

782
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:14,060
Rym: If I was ever going to go bicycle touring, I would definitely rent one of those.

783
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:19,838
Scott: But the problem with it is, A, you know, you gotta have those stupid flags so you don't, you get seen and not killed.

784
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,644
Rym: Well, they're not, you don't use those for, like, normal riding.

785
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:24,789
Rym: You use those for, like, I'm gonna bike to PAX.

786
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:26,421
Rym: I'm leaving now.

787
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:26,522
Rym: Sure.

788
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:30,646
Scott: So you bike to PAX and you're on some road, but people still need to see you.

789
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:30,990
Scott: Yeah.

790
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,466
Scott: Because you're way down on the ground.

791
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:32,628
Scott: Yeah.

792
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:34,059
Rym: Lights and flags.

793
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,119
Scott: You gotta have big lights and flags and it's pretty dorky.

794
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:39,290
Rym: Uh, dorkiness is not something I care about as a biker.

795
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,770
Scott: Dorky is pretty significant.

796
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,504
Scott: It's high dorkiness level.

797
00:42:42,848 --> 00:42:47,250
Rym: One thing I got now that I never needed my entire life until I was in the city was the rear light.

798
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:47,951
Scott: Yeah.

799
00:42:48,195 --> 00:42:50,625
Rym: I always had the front light because I'd bike through the woods at night.

800
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:54,810
Rym: Like, you know, middle of the night, middle of the woods, without a light, that's basically death waiting to happen.

801
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,141
Scott: Well, you know, there's two kinds of lights.

802
00:42:56,202 --> 00:42:57,534
Scott: There's see and be seen.

803
00:42:57,574 --> 00:42:57,756
Rym: Yep.

804
00:42:57,857 --> 00:43:00,280
Rym: And I, basically, in the city, I don't need to see.

805
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,716
Rym: No matter how dark it is.

806
00:43:01,756 --> 00:43:05,654
Scott: Well, there's some places where the street lights are a little bleh, so you do need to see a little bit.

807
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:05,856
Rym: Where?

808
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:09,595
Rym: The light from the clouds from Manhattan is enough in most of the cities.

809
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:13,454
Scott: No, there's, like, a couple streets I go down on the way home sometimes that have, uh, heavy tree cover.

810
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:14,202
Rym: Oh, in Queens?

811
00:43:14,323 --> 00:43:14,606
Rym: Yeah.

812
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:14,950
Rym: Yeah.

813
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:15,736
Scott: I can see that.

814
00:43:15,756 --> 00:43:20,484
Scott: So, it's, like, this one place right next to a school, where if you go there at night, it's only, like, half a block.

815
00:43:20,787 --> 00:43:23,414
Scott: But it is dark half a block because there are trees there.

816
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:26,690
Scott: And you can't see anything because the trees completely cover the street.

817
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,850
Rym: But I only need the lights now in the city.

818
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:29,899
Rym: They're the Annoy-a-trons.

819
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,403
Rym: They're the, "Please don't hit me with your car, you

820
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:33,129
Rym: jackasses.".

821
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:33,573
Scott: Yep.

822
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:36,809
Scott: You also get out of reflectors on, you know, some part of you because, you know.

823
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:38,810
Rym: Yeah, well, every bike comes with reflectors.

824
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,483
Scott: No, I mean, like, you know, like, on your bag or on your hat or something like that.

825
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:43,109
Scott: No, I don't do any of that.

826
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,475
Rym: I got the two Annoy-a-trons from the bag.

827
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:47,880
Scott: I got, like, because my Timbuk2 bag has reflectors built in.

828
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,829
Rym: Oh, yeah, I guess mine does, too.

829
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:49,313
Scott: Yeah.

830
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:50,628
Rym: I forgot about that.

831
00:43:51,793 --> 00:43:53,010
Rym: But I got reflectors all over the bike.

832
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,970
Rym: I got a rear reflector and the Annoy-a-tron.

833
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:55,532
Rym: Yeah.

834
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:58,041
Rym: And that Annoy-a-tron, let me tell you, is really fucking annoying.

835
00:43:58,082 --> 00:43:58,789
Rym: I got a really good one.

836
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:05,759
Rym: It blinks in this double irregular pattern of white, like, this white flash and then a whole bunch of red going, like, bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-bit-a.

837
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:07,476
Rym: And it's way bright.

838
00:44:07,496 --> 00:44:08,345
Rym: Like, it hurts to look at it.

839
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:09,435
Scott: I just got a pretty cheap one.

840
00:44:09,475 --> 00:44:12,264
Scott: It's still good, but it came in a set with also a little bike computer.

841
00:44:12,284 --> 00:44:12,830
Scott: It's fun.

842
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,101
Rym: Yeah, I gotta get a bike computer.

843
00:44:14,627 --> 00:44:15,052
Scott: You know what?

844
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:15,738
Scott: Just use your phone.

845
00:44:16,344 --> 00:44:20,950
Rym: Yeah, well, my phone's GPS, if I leave it too long, will occasionally start jumping.

846
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,415
Scott: It'll be like... Well, you're gonna have a different phone soon.

847
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:24,183
Rym: Yeah, it's like, oh, he was...

848
00:44:24,263 --> 00:44:26,630
Scott: And now what you do is you get a mount for your phone on your bike.

849
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,850
Rym: Like, one day, I biked around Metlas Central Park.

850
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,001
Rym: Like, I went over the bridge.

851
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:33,395
Rym: I did a whole lap around Central Park, and then I went, like, downtown and back home.

852
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:35,132
Rym: And I knew how far I went.

853
00:44:35,192 --> 00:44:37,679
Rym: I looked, and it was like, you went 88 miles.

854
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:38,389
Rym: And I'm like, huh.

855
00:44:39,131 --> 00:44:40,443
Rym: I went 88 miles, eh?

856
00:44:40,463 --> 00:44:41,189
Rym: So I look at the map.

857
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,010
Scott: Wow, 88 miles an hour.

858
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:43,838
Scott: You can go back in time.

859
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:52,368
Rym: According to the map, I went halfway to Central Park, then I teleported to the Hudson, biked around there for a while, came back to Central Park.

860
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:54,246
Rym: Yeah.

861
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:56,629
Rym: Way to go, Palm.

862
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,929
Rym: Of course, now they're selling that watch.

863
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:00,668
Scott: What the hell watch?

864
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,680
Rym: The HP Metal.

865
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,550
Rym: Okay.

866
00:45:02,812 --> 00:45:07,702
Rym: It's some gimmick that links your pre to your laptop, to your computer, to the cloud.

867
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:08,168
Rym: I don't know.

868
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,190
Rym: I haven't even read the pig out of it yet.

869
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:11,195
Rym: We'll see.

870
00:45:11,256 --> 00:45:11,682
Rym: We'll see.

871
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:14,370
Rym: All right.

872
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,662
Rym: So, do you want, like, seriously, do you want to go mountain biking at some point this summer?

873
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:18,350
Scott: Not really.

874
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:19,680
Rym: I mean, because we did.

875
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:27,558
Rym: Remember that one time when we lived in Beacon, we got in my car, we parked in that condo parking lot, and then we went to Red Oaks Mill with all the ticks and went mountain biking.

876
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,690
Scott: Yeah, that was not so exciting.

877
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:28,994
Rym: Really?

878
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:29,869
Rym: I thought it was really fun.

879
00:45:30,515 --> 00:45:31,444
Rym: When we got to that gorge.

880
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:33,181
Scott: Yeah, like when you ran over my bike with your car.

881
00:45:33,201 --> 00:45:33,444
Scott: Yeah.

882
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:35,785
Rym: That was actually pretty funny.

883
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:39,445
Rym: I forgot about that until just now.

884
00:45:39,506 --> 00:45:40,577
Rym: We're like, are we all set?

885
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:41,326
Rym: Is everything mounted?

886
00:45:41,346 --> 00:45:44,375
Rym: We're both like, yeah, we get in the car and we back up and we're like, what's that noise?

887
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:46,535
Rym: We get out and your bike, we just never put it on the car.

888
00:45:46,938 --> 00:45:47,805
Rym: I just ran over it.

889
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:51,167
Scott: Well, no, it was a tire that was just left on there.

890
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:51,288
Scott: Yeah.

891
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:55,160
Rym: It caught my muffler, too, which fell off later, unrelatedly.

892
00:45:55,282 --> 00:45:56,090
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

893
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,274
Scott: That bike is gone.

894
00:45:58,295 --> 00:45:58,863
Scott: It exploded.

895
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:00,899
Rym: The other bike I used?

896
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:01,585
Rym: Still got it.

897
00:46:01,646 --> 00:46:02,170
Rym: It's downstairs.

898
00:46:02,812 --> 00:46:04,980
Scott: Well, that bike served me well at RIT.

899
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:06,969
Rym: Yeah, and then it filled with water and exploded.

900
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:08,436
Rym: Poor bike.

901
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:09,489
Scott: Oh, well.

902
00:46:10,873 --> 00:46:11,889
Rym: I think we're petering out.

903
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:12,374
Rym: It's late.

904
00:46:12,414 --> 00:46:12,858
Rym: We're tired.

905
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:17,950
Rym: We may or may not have recorded a lot of other unrelated things today.

906
00:46:19,032 --> 00:46:19,480
Rym: Day?

907
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:20,566
Rym: Actually, it is night now.

908
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:26,435
Rym: But yeah, we recorded this a while ago and we needed a throwaway episode, so bikes.

909
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:27,284
Rym: Yep.

910
00:46:27,466 --> 00:46:27,769
Rym: Bikes.

911
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:28,492
Scott: Yep.

912
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:29,127
Rym: Bikes.

913
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,503
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

914
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:43,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

915
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,989
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

916
00:46:49,211 --> 00:46:51,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

917
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,140
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

918

919
00:46:59,963 --> 00:47:04,487
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

920
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:07,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
