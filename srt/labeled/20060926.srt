1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,894
Scott: It's Tuesday September 26th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:17,336
Scott: We discuss the old board game Stratego.

3
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:20,697
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:24,330
Scott: So today, I realized the next week.

5
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:26,780
Scott: I only have to work three days.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,508
Rym: Theoretically I only have to work four days.

7
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,859
Rym: They haven't actually told me if I get Friday off or not.

8
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:34,149
Scott: Really, yeah, worst case.

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,179
Rym: I'll come Friday evening on my own.

10
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:47,480
Scott: Okay, because on Monday is the Jew holiday Yom Kippur Which is the day where you don't eat and all your sins go away, and I don't believe any of that.

11
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:55,300
Scott: but I'm gonna take off Rovonika and Friday is Sittacon.

12
00:00:57,248 --> 00:01:08,398
Rym: Yeah, so once again we're gonna plug it all week this week and next week because we're going and While we have gone to many cons as GeekNights and as other things This is the first con that is offered to pay our whole way.

13
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:10,104
Scott: Hooray for Sittacon.

14
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:12,852
Rym: Not just our badge in or hotel.

15
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:17,907
Scott: Yes, Sittacon is the SUNY IT Anime Club convention.

16
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:22,720
Scott: It is an anime con in Utica, New York, and it is pretty cool.

17
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,906
Rym: Did you sound any less enthusiastic?

18
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,270
Rym: That was like the most horrible.

19
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:26,852
Scott: I'm just cuz.

20
00:01:26,872 --> 00:01:28,215
Scott: I'm just giving the information now.

21
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:28,857
Rym: Whatever.

22
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:29,820
Rym: It's gonna be awesome.

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,829
Rym: We're doing a whole crazy ton of stuff at this camp.

24
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,300
Scott: We're running a game show and we're doing panels.

25
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:36,962
Scott: We're doing what?

26
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:37,704
Rym: three panels?

27
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:43,380
Scott: Yeah, we're doing an artist alley table and we're doing all sorts of crazy batshit like this con.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,639
Rym: So if you're anywhere near you should go now, I know we have a good number of listeners back at RIT.

29
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:51,028
Rym: It's not that far from you guys.

30
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:52,875
Scott: It's only like two to three hours ish.

31
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:56,740
Rym: Yeah, probably two hours I mean, it's a little bit past Syracuse on the Thruway.

32
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:03,120
Scott: Yep, that's that it's you know, right in the middle of New York State, you know equidistant from anywhere in the entire state.

33
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:14,088
Scott: so if you're in New York State or Southern Ontario or Western Connecticut, Massachusetts Vermont New Hampshire Something like that.

34
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:15,900
Rym: Yeah, that was great Scott.

35
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:16,844
Rym: Yeah Pretty much.

36
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:20,610
Rym: if you live within a few hours this place I'd highly recommend you go because one.

37
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:31,298
Rym: it's one of those small Anime cons that's just starting out and they're almost always awesome because the only people who go to them tend to be awesome people Yep, and they tend to be really cheap.

38
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:35,253
Scott: The other thing is I've spoken to the guy running the con.

39
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:36,720
Scott: They sound like they know what they're doing.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,069
Scott: So I really doubt it's gonna be one of those.

41
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:42,160
Scott: Oh people tried to run a con, but they screwed it up deals.

42
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:45,654
Rym: Well, they've got their act together more than at least half of the cons.

43
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:47,020
Rym: I've been talking to in recent memory.

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,808
Scott: I know if you look at the guests they've collected.

45
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,620
Scott: I mean they collected a bunch of podcasters, which isn't hard.

46
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:53,240
Rym: They got entertainment system.

47
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,500
Scott: They got entertainment system and they got the video game pianist guy, which you know just shows.

48
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,467
Scott: Hey, they they're up to something now.

49
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,257
Rym: No, we actually have a relevant anecdote about entertainment system.

50
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:02,960
Scott: Yeah, we do.

51
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:04,867
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if I think I'll save it.

52
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,795
Rym: Yeah, I'll save it for next week the pregame.

53
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:08,019
Scott: Okay, we'll save it.

54
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:12,245
Scott: Regardless go if you're thinking about going www.s.

55
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:15,036
Scott: I ta con.

56
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:20,619
Scott: Sit a con like sit a con it really whips the llama's ass.

57
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:23,326
Rym: Really we're there we're we're.

58
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:26,195
Scott: we're really whips the llama's ass.

59
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:27,700
Rym: whatever it's video game day.

60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,462
Scott: Yeah, it is.

61
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:32,857
Rym: I'll let your news go first because my news is a is a Jack Thompson news.

62
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:34,864
Scott: Oh god That's all right.

63
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:38,260
Scott: I think half of your news is Jack Thompson and Sony news.

64
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:43,023
Rym: You know what on video game day it is because there's not much other video game news I care about.

65
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:50,212
Rym: I mean, I'm not gonna report on rumors about the Wii or Rumors about the PlayStation 3 or rumors about any.

66
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,380
Scott: I'm not gonna report on rumors about anything either.

67
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,860
Rym: But and I was gonna talk about white knight because penny arcade went nuts about this game and so did half the internet.

68
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:07,320
Rym: But while the trailer was really pretty and it looked really cool There is absolutely not enough information to say anything valuable about this game.

69
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:09,371
Scott: No, there was other than that.

70
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,498
Rym: It was very pretty.

71
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:22,019
Scott: Yep Alright, so I want someone to go and look in the archives of front row crew comm and find out how many times Rym has made a Sony news and how many times he's out of Jack Thompson news.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,676
Scott: So we get a little tally going up here, you know on the virtual chalkboard.

73
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:26,380
Scott: That is the forum.

74
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,188
Rym: Well, remember they both have the same standard.

75
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:32,017
Rym: they have to do something crazier than something they've already done.

76
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:47,640
Scott: Alright anyway Everyone knows that, you know Nintendo seems to be getting it on with opera, you know they have an opera browser for the DS that costs 30 bucks and it comes a little flashcard and whatever and I don't know if that's out yet in this country.

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,005
Scott: But it's gonna be for sure.

78
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:52,940
Scott: and the Wii is gonna have opera for your web browsing pleasure.

79
00:04:53,763 --> 00:05:04,340
Scott: But it was just announced today a hundred percent sure not a rumor that Opera for the Wii will be free until June of 2007.

80
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:11,751
Scott: So if you get a Wii before June of 2007, you can download opera and install it on your Wii For nothing.

81
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:13,402
Scott: just click there it is now.

82
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:20,451
Rym: think of this not so much for us as gamers because many of us gamer types probably already have a computer plugged Into the TV and it's not a big deal.

83
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:25,120
Rym: We run our emulators there and everything But we're not the focus of all these things.

84
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:25,859
Rym: They're putting in the Wii.

85
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:34,485
Rym: Imagine normal people to whom if you showed them a computer booked up to a TV with an emulator and a web browser They wouldn't know what to think.

86
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:35,167
Rym: They just go nuts.

87
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,134
Scott: Well, here's another thing.

88
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:43,780
Scott: I want to point out is that The Wii first of all, the wiimote is a is a very good pointing device, you know.

89
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,840
Scott: Which is good for using a browser - people are really familiar with using a remote control.

90
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:56,340
Scott: So if they can use a remote control device to browse the web You know, my grandma has a hard time using a web browser because she's an old grandma.

91
00:05:56,962 --> 00:06:01,440
Scott: But if she had a remote control to browse the web, I imagine she'd have a much better time of it.

92
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,409
Rym: I know that my grandpa has absolutely no trouble surfing the web.

93
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,218
Scott: Yeah, my grandpa also kind of doesn't.

94
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:09,098
Scott: it's mostly that They don't know what they should do.

95
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:12,092
Scott: You know, not that they don't know how to do it as much.

96
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:13,137
Scott: I mean, they really don't know.

97
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:26,692
Scott: but anyway also We currently have a computer plugged into our TV a Mac Mini with Firefox and that's all well and good for browsing the web But it's not perfect for browsing the web on a TV.

98
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:29,160
Scott: I mean you can't maximize things on a Mac.

99
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,112
Scott: You can't full-screen Firefox on the Mac.

100
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:32,340
Rym: There are ways around that.

101
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:32,943
Rym: We just haven't.

102
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:36,560
Scott: there are ways around it and you know, you have to keep adjusting font sizes.

103
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:46,100
Scott: But if if I had a Wii and I had opera on it I would probably end up using that to browse the web a lot more especially since it'll have flash and all this other stuff.

104
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,675
Scott: You know playing flash games with the wiimote.

105
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:53,380
Rym: Hello Well beside all that I mean once again to all the normal people out there.

106
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,088
Rym: So, I mean this is a crazy thing.

107
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:55,772
Rym: you buy this Wii.

108
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:56,354
Rym: it's 250 bucks.

109
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:58,880
Rym: It's a next-gen console.

110
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,473
Rym: additionally, it checks the weather for you and It effectively emulates all of the functionality of web TV and more.

111
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:10,645
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty badass Very badass.

112
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,015
Scott: and I'm actually you know, the weather thing.

113
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,040
Scott: at first I'm like weather.

114
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,160
Scott: What are they talking about?

115
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,400
Scott: But I'm probably gonna use that weather a lot because all the weather checking I do on my computer either takes too much effort.

116
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:24,278
Scott: You know visit a website type in the zip code, press enter.

117
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:30,440
Rym: wait Scott you realize that you can just go into the widgets on the Mac, which is also right there and see the weather.

118
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:31,766
Scott: I know but not like.

119
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:35,605
Scott: not with the maps and everything, you know, it's not the full weather It's just the summary.

120
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:36,853
Rym: there are widgets that do that.

121
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:42,535
Scott: Yeah, but yeah It'd be like it'd be easier to turn on the Wii with the remote control.

122
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:45,868
Rym: or you know The Mac that's already on and has a remote control.

123
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:47,233
Scott: the remote control doesn't do the widgets.

124
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:49,220
Rym: you can fucks with remote control.

125
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:52,116
Scott: I didn't know how to fucks with the remote control already.

126
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:52,780
Scott: It's more effort.

127
00:07:53,122 --> 00:08:00,480
Scott: The point is is while we might be able to do that You know with a little bit of effort it now requires no effort, which is good for dumb people.

128
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:04,692
Rym: I guess in general the Wii is just coming out gangbusters.

129
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:07,400
Rym: I mean, they're gonna have a million units at launch in the US alone.

130
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:08,664
Rym: It's real cheap.

131
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,312
Rym: It's got this crazy launch lineup.

132
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,760
Rym: I can't imagine better news to come out.

133
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:20,920
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing I wonder though is opera unlike Mozilla opera is a profit company, aren't they?

134
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:22,471
Scott: And they used to make their money.

135
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:28,000
Scott: they're putting ads in opera But now they give opera away for free which they kind of have to do to compete with Firefox.

136
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,967
Rym: Well considering up one of the main things opera always claims to have going forward and a lot of people agree Is that it?

137
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:40,039
Rym: Generally is better for devices that don't have the best displays because of the way it handles scaling and that sort of thing.

138
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:46,957
Scott: yeah, opera is basically making their money by making versions of opera for non computers.

139
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:50,973
Scott: if it's not a Computer opera is makes a version for it.

140
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:56,339
Scott: They've got like opera palm Opera for any, you know little weird cell phone.

141
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:08,760
Rym: now I'll bet that Nintendo and opera have some sort of deal where Nintendo probably didn't pay very much if anything Because this is a lot of press for opera it is but I still wonder where exactly the money comes from.

142
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:18,525
Scott: I mean sure if someone buys opera DS opera gets money and I'm pretty sure that when opera is no longer Free on the Wii that if you have to pay for it They'll get money or what?

143
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:20,373
Rym: if I mean how for-profit is opera?

144
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,297
Rym: how much money do they make?

145
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:21,880
Rym: is that public?

146
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,141
Scott: I don't know.

147
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,506
Scott: I had to look that up.

148
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:28,220
Rym: They could be like ghost script where they're for-profit, but yet they don't make any money.

149
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:33,051
Scott: I'm gonna really I'm gonna think I'm gonna spend tomorrow like Google's new charity.

150
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:36,220
Rym: don't think technically they're for-profit because it's easier that way.

151
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:43,360
Scott: Yeah, I think tomorrow I'm gonna do some research into how opera makes money and how much money they make and I'll come back with a report.

152
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:46,024
Rym: So Jack Thompson.

153
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,649
Rym: Oh, I love you.

154
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,438
Rym: You provide so much joy.

155
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:51,040
Scott: Wait a minute.

156
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:53,188
Scott: Rym loves old man.

157
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:53,870
Scott: write this down.

158
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:00,100
Rym: You know, I killed a man in Reno once just to watch him die.

159
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:03,063
Rym: Yeah All right anyway Jack Thompson.

160
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:30,642
Rym: now the the news itself is not the issue here because the news is some kid played a bunch of Grand Theft Auto Went nuts shot some people and now there's a 600 million dollar lawsuit against the makers of Grand Theft Auto Vice City, which they claim he played Obsessively claiming that basically this game caused him to do it now 600 million dollars and claiming that this game the game that they allowed him to play Obsessively

161
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,666
Scott: game they bought for him

162
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:36,525
Rym: the game they bought for him and allowed him to play kid 14

163
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:37,899
Scott: Uh-huh, and was the game rated M

164
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:39,262
Rym: Yep,

165
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:49,348
Scott: so even if I was take two when I lost this lawsuit to Jack Thompson Which the chances of are basically nil because Jack Thompson doesn't want a lawsuit in his life as far as I know At least not everyone that mattered.

166
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:52,020
Scott: Well, can I would just counter sue the parents?

167
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:54,239
Rym: Now now that's it.

168
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,597
Rym: I mean they talk about how he obsessively played the game for several months before he shot all these people.

169
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,100
Rym: is that in the state custody whatever?

170
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:07,920
Rym: Now the quotes around this trial are the actual news here because if they hadn't said these things I would let this slide.

171
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:09,289
Rym: This wasn't a big deal.

172
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,820
Scott: All right, bring on the funny quotes.

173
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,580
Scott: I will rate them on a scale of one to five five being hilarious pee in my pants one being.

174
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:22,415
Rym: Now I'll begin with the obvious one because he says this all the time Grand Theft Auto series depict police killings and other acts of violence.

175
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:26,209
Rym: a lawsuit calls Here we go virtual reality murder simulators.

176
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,720
Rym: Jack Thompson has said that phrase more than he said any other phrase ever.

177
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:33,091
Scott: Yeah, I'll give it a two just because a lot of people don't know.

178
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,737
Scott: Jack Thompson says that now.

179
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:35,620
Rym: now here's a nice one.

180
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:41,250
Rym: But for the kids use of these products he would not have killed.

181
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:54,762
Rym: Five because it's false Straight up in perfect logic that because he used Grand Theft Auto He killed and if he had not used it, he would not have killed Quo-quo.

182
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:58,690
Scott: if they could demonstrate that in a court of law, I will eat my hat.

183
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,176
Scott: Good cuz I had to go buy a hat now.

184
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,262
Rym: This is the part.

185
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:08,953
Rym: I mean there's a whole bunch of quotes in here, but this is my favorite one.

186
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:10,657
Rym: the game trained him.

187
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:24,100
Rym: quotes How to point and shoot a gun in a fashion making him an extraordinarily effective killer Without teaching any of the restraints constraints and responsibilities needed to inhibit such a killing capacity.

188
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:32,455
Rym: ten But before I you know laugh hysterically I want to try to say that.

189
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,868
Rym: well if this were true Let's say that Jack Thompson is right.

190
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:37,936
Rym: Let's say that that sentence and everything.

191
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:38,780
Rym: He said is correct.

192
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:42,389
Rym: That means that by playing counter-strike through college.

193
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,176
Rym: I am a dangerous motherfucker now.

194
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:46,620
Scott: You'd better watch out for me.

195
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,499
Scott: I'm coming to freaking hose everyone down the cops on people to touch me.

196
00:12:50,831 --> 00:13:01,860
Rym: Yeah I mean according to this lawsuit Scott and I could single-handedly if I had a Mac 10 and Scott had an mp5 and a Desert Eagle take out the entirety of the law enforcement in the United States.

197
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:08,720
Scott: Only the only problems we could have is running out of ammo and/or money to buy more ammo other than that.

198
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,964
Scott: Are you pretty invincible?

199
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:11,710
Rym: you get money every time you kill someone?

200
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,440
Scott: Yeah, dude, you better freakin lock up fatality.

201
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,890
Scott: He's gonna kill everyone.

202
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:17,099
Scott: Why don't we just send?

203
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,791
Scott: Fatality, you know, what's his name?

204
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,098
Scott: Jason Wendell, right?

205
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:27,260
Scott: Whatever Fatality, why don't we send fatality call back the army call back the Air Force?

206
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:36,879
Scott: Just give fatality a truck full of weapons and send him over to Iraq and he will kill every Terrorist and no one will be able to stop him.

207
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:44,940
Rym: Hello, duh Yeah, they also claim now that here's just another funny quote.

208
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,113
Rym: There's a two-quote two-word quote here talking about, you know, Sony of America.

209
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:51,160
Rym: take to its subsidiary rockstar games.

210
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:56,985
Rym: The lawsuit accuses all of these companies of a quote civil Conspiracy.

211
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,383
Rym: oh my god That's all I got.

212
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:10,595
Scott: if there was a civil conspiracy right then how come Sony and take to haven't hired Fatality to go kill Nintendo and Microsoft and their competitors.

213
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:11,660
Rym: I don't know.

214
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:18,104
Scott: I mean, there's no way they'd even know he did it cuz he'd be so badass and playing all those ninja games No one would see him.

215
00:14:18,747 --> 00:14:20,073
Rym: Well, I gotta say yeah, dude.

216
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:21,800
Scott: I played Ninja Gaiden when I was a kid.

217
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,442
Scott: You can't see me.

218
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:22,944
Scott: Can you?

219
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,711
Scott: I have such ninja skills.

220
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:24,972
Scott: I might.

221
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:25,915
Scott: I can go be bad Scott.

222
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:27,120
Rym: You have no idea.

223
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:28,697
Rym: I am a bad enough, dude.

224
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,280
Scott: Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the president?

225
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,100
Scott: I must be because I played through half of bad dudes at one point in the arcade.

226
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:36,643
Rym: You know what?

227
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:38,553
Rym: I actually really didn't like the game bad dude.

228
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:39,820
Scott: The bad dudes is a bad game.

229
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:40,449
Rym: I came sucked.

230
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:41,260
Rym: it did suck.

231
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:46,717
Scott: But the point is as I played Street Fighter and hung in a sonic boom you to God knows where.

232
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:47,619
Rym: sonic boom.

233
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:56,679
Rym: things of the day.

234
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:58,810
Rym: This one's gonna be nice and quick here.

235
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,740
Rym: It's a video that I think you should all watch now.

236
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:05,020
Rym: I'm sure everyone is familiar with the - world in Super Mario Brothers.

237
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,469
Scott: If you don't know what the - world is crack lack.

238
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,580
Rym: if you don't know - world is get the fuck out.

239
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,180
Scott: You don't know shit anyway.

240
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:20,512
Rym: So now Mario Brothers wasn't just released for the Famicom in the NES It was also released for the Famicom disk system.

241
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,538
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people don't realize this.

242
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:31,720
Scott: in Japan There was a very popular Famicom disk system Which is an NES where the games came on disks and there were a lot of games released for that that are very important.

243
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:41,218
Rym: so a Supposedly this video here on Kotaku is of what happens if you go into the - world in this slightly updated version of Super Mario Brothers.

244
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:53,519
Rym: the - world is Crazy and amazing and I guess the one thing this illustrates since a lot of my things of the day have illustrated various things lately Is that two types of people.

245
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,346
Rym: well I guess three types of people watch the video.

246
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:59,040
Rym: type a type one won't have any idea what the hell's going on.

247
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,455
Rym: You know 90 year olds and Jack Thompson Type two or beta will see this and think all right.

248
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:07,262
Rym: He did something glitchy with the video game Whatever.

249
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:15,878
Rym: and the third type of people will just be utterly amazed Especially when they see the third world and they'll whoa check out.

250
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:16,340
Rym: Oh my god.

251
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:18,748
Rym: And they just won't shut up about it.

252
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,620
Scott: and I'm the third type as am I all right.

253
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,074
Rym: So this is a nice test will show this video to people and see how they react.

254
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:28,020
Rym: you can tell whether or not they're a true gamer Mmm.

255
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:29,026
Scott: All right.

256
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:36,080
Scott: So this video is actually posted in the forum I think by water is poison and I think it's good enough to make a thing of the day.

257
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,105
Rym: It quite is it is.

258
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:52,355
Scott: it's called Farid or D&D or like the Battle of Farid or whatever and it's a short D&D live-action movie, you know like 12 minutes long sort of like that fear of girls, you know a little short movie about D&D playing

259
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:54,039
Rym: a lower cell for say ah

260
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:59,727
Scott: Yes, these guys they are from Quebec With the French Canadian.

261
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:00,750
Scott: In fact, it's on goo.

262
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,259
Scott: It's on video google.ca for Canada.

263
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:06,278
Scott: Anyway, what happens in this video is?

264
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:25,229
Scott: This guy goes to meet up with some old friends He used to play D&D with to play some D&D like the good old times and the DM is a cool, dude and he's a cool dude, you know, but the other two guys playing are sort of super serious about D&D and Conflict occurs as a result

265
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,051
Rym: Boba Fett.

266
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:39,311
Rym: Yeah, Boba Fett It's funny up until a moment when you think one thing is going to happen and then yeah There is one thing that happens in it.

267
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:43,155
Scott: That's sort of disturbing like It's not disturbing.

268
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:43,840
Scott: It's more like oh

269
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,999
Rym: I just started cracking up because yeah

270
00:17:49,102 --> 00:18:03,220
Scott: But I think the point of this video is that not only is it hilarious but it illustrates in very plain terms This is bad D&D and this is good D&D and it can show people even if they haven't played D&D before.

271
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:05,105
Scott: See D&D is.

272
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:09,478
Scott: it looks like this the stereotype but really it can be like this.

273
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:10,300
Scott: That's the good stuff.

274
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,351
Scott: That's what we do and that's what those nerds do.

275
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:14,120
Rym: Yeah, I mean there are different.

276
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,604
Rym: I mean Baron pretzels.

277
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:16,887
Rym: D&D has its place.

278
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:21,820
Rym: Yeah, but there are honestly some people out there take it way too seriously.

279
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,387
Scott: Yeah, I'm not talking about here's the thing.

280
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,672
Rym: They don't even take it seriously.

281
00:18:24,732 --> 00:18:26,460
Rym: in like a serious role-playing way.

282
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:28,126
Rym: There are people who take it seriously.

283
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,234
Rym: in this just scary kind of.

284
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:31,940
Rym: you could reach eighth level tonight.

285
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,505
Scott: Yeah, I'm not talking about it.

286
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,330
Scott: good D&D and bad D&D.

287
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:40,507
Scott: in first of you know, having fun versus you know Seriously being in a fantasy world.

288
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:44,280
Scott: I'm talking about, you know, the attitudes toward the game being good and bad.

289
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:51,039
Scott: You know one guy has the right attitude towards D&D and the other two guys They have a bad attitude that make the game kind of sucky.

290
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:58,280
Rym: I know people and I know people who have known people who played the kind of D&D that you're seeing in this video.

291
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:05,000
Scott: Yeah, yep, and so I suggest that everyone go watch this and learn and laugh.

292
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:19,417
Rym: Also as a total aside just because we talked about it just a little while ago to make a long story short our group has been debating a lot about the nature of D&D lately because our recent D&Ding hasn't Been as great as it used to be

293
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:20,082
Scott: Mm-hmm,

294
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:26,639
Rym: and we realized Scott and I a little while ago while watching some other stupid video That wasn't good enough to be a thing of the day.

295
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:33,131
Rym: The key factor that we have lost The table the table in the middle of the room.

296
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:35,940
Rym: We stopped playing around a table and that's when everything went to hell.

297
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:53,635
Scott: Yeah, we've been playing D&D for like six or seven years just in a room with everyone laying down You know reclining on a couch or sitting in a different area of the room all about the place and we realized hey When you all sit at a table, it keeps everyone in the game.

298
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:54,880
Scott: It keeps everyone involved.

299
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,687
Scott: People aren't off in their own world.

300
00:19:56,727 --> 00:20:00,280
Scott: people are you know, they're in physically and it makes a big difference.

301
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:09,860
Rym: Yep and I had all these flashbacks to like some of the best D&D games I had were even if they're not I had a table Everyone was sitting in a circle and everything was centralized and we're gonna do it.

302
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,257
Rym: We're gonna show in the future about D&D and how we play it and how to play.

303
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:18,259
Rym: but yeah We realized this just now and I think it is going to usher in a new era of.

304
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:20,308
Scott: I mean Look, we played that awesome burning wheel.

305
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,920
Scott: We were at a big table with a whole bunch of people around it.

306
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,876
Scott: Yeah, and that was key very key.

307
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:31,652
Scott: So I Recommend to everyone if you were playing any sort of tabletop role-playing game Don't leave out the table.

308
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:37,040
Rym: in the very least How could we have have a big room and sit in a circle in the room on the floor?

309
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:49,467
Scott: Yeah, don't let people lay all around the place like we've been, you know We got too casual and we realized now that that was probably or most likely the cause of much of our Not as good role-playing.

310
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:49,648
Rym: Yep.

311
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,600
Rym: I've just now thought of a couple other little things, but that'll be another show.

312
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,613
Rym: Yep, because tonight we're talking about something so completely the opposite of D&D.

313
00:20:57,974 --> 00:21:00,200
Scott: We're talking about a very old board game.

314
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:00,543
Scott: I think.

315
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:05,305
Scott: when did Stratego first get made like Early 20th century, right?

316
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:08,052
Rym: I believe it was invented by Leonardo da Vinci.

317
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:09,135
Scott: It wasn't real.

318
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:10,418
Rym: No, no Scott.

319
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,498
Scott: No I'm being silly.

320
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:19,500
Scott: You couldn't get the sarcastic tone of my voice.

321
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:23,900
Rym: No, because there have been times in the past where you were entirely non sarcastic about similar things.

322
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:27,332
Scott: Oh, well, I know that it wasn't made by.

323
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:32,493
Rym: well, uh for anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about I'm gonna pull a Cromartie here and I suggest you look in the forums.

324
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:44,274
Scott: Oh, well, it says here The origins of Stratego can be traced back to traditional Chinese board game jungle Also known as game of fighting game of the fighting animals or animal chests.

325
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:45,137
Rym: Uh-huh.

326
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:53,970
Scott: Yep Yeah, there was a 1910 version that was French and it kind of yeah, so that's how old this game is 1908.

327
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,715
Scott: Yeah, it was what like five bucks.

328
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,440
Scott: This game was wicked cheap.

329
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:09,500
Scott: I mean I had a copy of Stratego when I was a kid as did I. that was the 90s version and you know It probably cost ten bucks and the new one is pretty similar.

330
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,200
Scott: It's a different production a different printing of the game.

331
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:18,879
Rym: We're gonna bitch about something in the new version that I think most of you who didn't grow up playing board games We'll just think we're idiots.

332
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:20,184
Scott: Alright, let let's.

333
00:22:20,264 --> 00:22:25,583
Scott: I'm gonna start by giving a short description of the game because you could probably describe in great detail how the entire Game function.

334
00:22:25,604 --> 00:22:26,972
Scott: Yeah, it is a very simple game.

335
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:27,354
Scott: You're ready.

336
00:22:27,374 --> 00:22:28,320
Scott: There's a map.

337
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,835
Scott: The map is a bunch of squares and there what?

338
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:32,980
Scott: how many squares on each side?

339
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,800
Scott: One of the or five six seven a ten time forty squares on each side, whatever?

340
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:40,900
Rym: Yeah big grid with two sets of water in the middle that no one can walk.

341
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:50,665
Scott: There are two sets of water in the middle which means there's only three different pathways that connect one side to the other side and each of those pathways is four squares in a square.

342
00:22:50,685 --> 00:23:00,240
Scott: and on one side You fill the map with blue pieces and the other mat side is filled with red pieces and they fight and one guy wins.

343
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:01,746
Scott: Now, how do you win?

344
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:05,420
Scott: capture the flag move one of your guys to the other side of the map?

345
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:09,899
Scott: Find the flag piece and Touch it and you win.

346
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:12,609
Scott: Now the thing is not.

347
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:13,792
Scott: every piece is the same.

348
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:14,715
Scott: some pieces.

349
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:15,378
Scott: There's one piece.

350
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:15,980
Scott: That's the flag.

351
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:27,451
Scott: there are some pieces with numbers on them and In the original version that we played when we were kids number one was the most powerful piece Yep, and number nine was the scout.

352
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:27,894
Scott: Yep.

353
00:23:27,994 --> 00:23:35,200
Scott: nowadays in the version We just bought recently semi recently number ten is the most powerful piece and number two is the scout.

354
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,874
Scott: So the game isn't changed except they reverse the numbers to confuse us.

355
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:40,580
Rym: now the rationale.

356
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:43,547
Rym: I've heard a few people posit as to why they changed.

357
00:23:43,628 --> 00:23:51,897
Rym: it was simply that people are dumb and Higher numbers should be more powerful because otherwise people don't get it and those people are stupid.

358
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:54,016
Rym: and yeah Yeah I got to say it.

359
00:23:54,722 --> 00:24:02,034
Rym: It's weird how much that messes me up because I played the game as a kid and it's so ingrained in my head Like it's really sort of an arbitrary decision.

360
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,000
Scott: Like it wouldn't matter.

361
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:05,420
Scott: It's just the fact that we're used to one way.

362
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:08,771
Rym: I think eights I think eight.

363
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:18,322
Rym: so I keep seeing my eights which are now the kernels But I keep thinking they're miners and I have to force myself to think otherwise and I often put pieces where I didn't want to Put them.

364
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:20,820
Scott: Yeah, I'm starting to get used to the new system.

365
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:35,743
Scott: I'm generally a lot looking at the pictures a lot because the miners have the point on the head a little spear coming out of It you know, so anyway The way that so you have these guys and the very powerful guys the number ten the nine and the eight you don't have So many of those.

366
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:40,359
Scott: you have only one number ten guy one number nine guy two eights, you know, etc, etc.

367
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:43,018
Scott: But the scouts you have like a whole mess of them.

368
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:47,039
Scott: Now the other kind of piece you have is the bombs.

369
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:49,173
Scott: bombs don't move.

370
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:55,500
Scott: if Anyone touches a bomb they die unless they're a minor in which case they defuse the bomb.

371
00:24:56,422 --> 00:25:03,880
Scott: So, obviously the way this game works is you have one you you put your flag on your side and you surround it with bombs.

372
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:13,798
Scott: if you don't it's stupid because someone's gonna come in and take it and then the other guy is forced to fight you and Also to find where your flag is.

373
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:21,918
Scott: Bring these weak weak units the miners all the way over to the other side of the map defuse the bombs and then find the flag.

374
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:26,523
Scott: and Yeah, it makes for a lot of fun To do this.

375
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:27,285
Rym: Yeah.

376
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:32,820
Scott: Now the game is not terribly strategically deep despite the name of the game being Stratego.

377
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:50,358
Rym: I mean it is until a point because there are a lot of gambits and a lot of chess like trees of decision-making in the game, however usually it's pretty obvious what you should do and There's really not a lot of actual intelligent decision-making.

378
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:55,214
Scott: in the end A lot of the game if you have two good players playing against each other to win.

379
00:25:55,234 --> 00:26:04,359
Scott: a lot of it just comes down to The initial setup, you know if this guy sets it up initially like this and the other guys sets it up initially like that They might as well just turn over their pieces and say who wins.

380
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:09,480
Rym: Yep, because you need a clever setup and there's also a lot of psychology Because there is a lot of psych.

381
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:15,552
Rym: I mean the most powerful piece in the game is the ten or the one or the marshal Can kill anything on the board except if he kills.

382
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:16,940
Rym: if he hits a bomb he dies.

383
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:20,639
Rym: And of course if the spy attacks him he dies.

384
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,179
Scott: Yeah, there's one spy unit that's basically useless unless it attacks the number ten.

385
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,985
Rym: Now if the ten attacks it it dies.

386
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:32,400
Rym: only if it attacks the ten and if a ten attacks another ten they both die.

387
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:32,524
Rym: Yeah.

388
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,264
Rym: So you have got to.

389
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:47,036
Rym: the best way to win is to somehow get the other person to lose a high-ranking piece that you still Have because now that piece is utterly 100% invincible unless it attacks a bomb.

390
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:51,592
Scott: Yeah, for example Let's say Rym marches is nine forward and I attack it with my ten.

391
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:52,154
Scott: Now.

392
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:57,008
Scott: I have a ten and a nine and He doesn't have a ten.

393
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:59,980
Scott: Yeah, I still have a ten, but he doesn't have a nine.

394
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:06,479
Scott: So now I can run my nine around all willy-nilly and it's just as powerful as my ten But it doesn't have to fear the spy.

395
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:11,640
Rym: So it's not just as powerful because it can still be killed by my ten by the ten.

396
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:25,577
Scott: But then if I see your ten, I'll have no qualms about double suiciding it at all You know, well no because if you lose your nine to my ten and then you double suicide now, no No, it's if you've lost your nine and then our tens double suicide.

397
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,480
Scott: That's good for me.

398
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:27,835
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

399
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:29,538
Scott: That's what I said.

400
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:33,529
Rym: But there's a lot of psychology that I mean even down to the point.

401
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:43,199
Rym: the things I used to do a lot especially when I was a kid to beat my Brother at this game to beat my dad at this game and my friends is and I showed Scott all this He's like how you fucker but now he does it too.

402
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,148
Rym: Yeah, yeah is I'd move a piece.

403
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:49,256
Rym: I'll go from like the least bastardly to the most bastardly.

404
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:54,160
Rym: I'd move a piece as Though it were more powerful than it was like I know it's his ten.

405
00:27:54,741 --> 00:28:01,440
Rym: I start moving up freaking two or three or four toward it and a lot of times the other person will back off.

406
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,878
Rym: Whoa, wait a minute Got it?

407
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:09,239
Rym: Got to be careful here and you can use pieces because every piece is equally threatening until you finally find out what it is.

408
00:28:09,682 --> 00:28:11,740
Scott: Yeah, it's every piece on one side.

409
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:12,844
Scott: They all look the same.

410
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:18,044
Scott: the flag looks the same as a bomb looks the same as the ten looks the same as a two To the other guy.

411
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:20,799
Scott: He doesn't know what you've got and he doesn't know where it is.

412
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:28,779
Scott: So if you start moving around a four in the same way You would move it as if it were a spy.

413
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:37,199
Scott: The other guy might think it's spy and you can maybe bluff him out and thus bide some time to make another move on the other side of the board.

414
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:43,220
Rym: Yeah, and the obvious optimal strategies are pretty much just to be very defensive.

415
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:51,640
Rym: Don't move a piece if you don't have to because the moment I move a piece I have now told the other person that that piece is not a bomb and it's also not a flag.

416
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:53,967
Rym: Yes, it's not the bomb or the flag.

417
00:28:54,187 --> 00:29:06,660
Rym: So us what if I say cuz this happened once in a game where I destroyed Scott's 10 with the spy I Still had my 10. that meant that my 10 could kill any piece on the board that moved with no danger.

418
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:12,040
Rym: So what I would do is I would wait for him to move a piece cuz you have to move a piece or you lose.

419
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:16,357
Rym: As soon as every time he moved a piece, I just chase it down with my one and kill it ten one.

420
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:21,440
Scott: Yeah, yeah, cuz he knows it's not a bomb and he knows it can't kill his ten.

421
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,354
Scott: So anything that moves he can kill and eventually with that process.

422
00:29:25,395 --> 00:29:26,619
Scott: He's gonna kill everything I've got.

423
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,406
Rym: Yep, another very.

424
00:29:28,587 --> 00:29:30,795
Scott: all I can do is trick him into moving it into a bomb.

425
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:32,180
Rym: now moving up from there.

426
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:43,900
Rym: Another very classic thing I would often do is I'd be think considering my turn and say I have two guys adjacent to one of Scott's Guys, one of those guys is a bomb that can't move and one of them is like a three.

427
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,838
Rym: now I'll sit there like I don't act like I'm considering my move and I'll Pick up the bomb or put my finger on the bomb like I'm gonna move it and then change my mind.

428
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:57,536
Rym: now Psychologically my opponent might think he was about to move that piece.

429
00:29:57,556 --> 00:29:58,380
Rym: There's no way it's a bomb.

430
00:29:59,301 --> 00:30:00,326
Rym: Haha, it's a bomb.

431
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,512
Scott: I don't think that at all.

432
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:02,820
Scott: I wait till I seen it move.

433
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:05,927
Scott: Yeah, yeah But other people might be fooled by that.

434
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:10,758
Rym: you can do the same thing with the scouts because scouts can move in any one direction unlimitedly.

435
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:10,927
Rym: Yeah.

436
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:17,649
Scott: So if you have a scout you can move it forward ten spaces and the point of the scout is not to hurt anything Cuz it really can't hurt anything.

437
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,340
Scott: It's to see what's up ahead.

438
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,645
Scott: So like let's say you've cleared out a lot of his side of the board and you you see a piece over there That hasn't moved.

439
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:28,380
Scott: you send your scout all the way to the end of the board in one turn.

440
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,397
Scott: You just say what's that and they'll say it's a bomb and then you know where to send your miners.

441
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:35,471
Scott: because that's what the bombs Are at, you know, that's the point of a scout.

442
00:30:35,592 --> 00:30:39,888
Scott: Yep, but let's say you have a scout what if you move it one space at a time?

443
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,426
Scott: now you're tricking the other guy into thinking it's not a scout and He might go after it.

444
00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:47,515
Scott: but oh you just went after a scout.

445
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,499
Scott: you wasted your time.

446
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:56,159
Rym: There's one thing I very often do is I'll never put more than maybe one scout in my front line Because scouts die against anything except well the spy.

447
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:10,448
Rym: So what I would do is that way and Scott always falls for this to this day whether I win or lose He always loses almost all the scouts right away because I put a bunch of bores or sevens at the front of my line Which is the weakest unit that will kill a scout.

448
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,803
Rym: and then Scott will send his scouts up right away and they all die against My front line.

449
00:31:15,145 --> 00:31:16,691
Rym: and now I have more guys left.

450
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:18,820
Rym: He loses his scouts which gives me an advantage.

451
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:28,108
Scott: Yeah, as a result of this I've only slightly changed my strategy because I still keep a bunch of scouts on the front line Because I want to see.

452
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:31,200
Scott: you know, you never know it could his front line could be anything at all.

453
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:51,360
Scott: I don't know if he's gonna use the same strategy every time and By discovering what he has on the front line right away I'm able to rearrange my front lines and set up the proper defense and you know Arrangement and then go out because you know, who knows if I'll set up the proper arrangement luckily In my initial setup where I have no information at all.

454
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:56,720
Rym: But you have to be careful because when you're it takes very difficult to rearrange because it's difficult to move pieces.

455
00:31:56,821 --> 00:31:59,480
Scott: It is that's why the scouts go out and die.

456
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:03,120
Scott: They also free up space for the rearrangement right at the front.

457
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:05,420
Scott: Where is the exact spot where I want to rearrange now?

458
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:13,660
Scott: The other thing though is I am careful to save three or four scouts until later in the game After I've cleared out much of his area.

459
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:23,216
Scott: I need to send those guys down there to find out where the bombs are without you know Dangerously moving my high-ranking pieces around stepping on things that haven't moved.

460
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:23,858
Rym: Yep.

461
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:26,206
Rym: Now in the game We recently played I actually lost this one.

462
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:27,711
Rym: I made a critic.

463
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:28,012
Rym: It was.

464
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:33,332
Scott: it was not so much an error as a Yeah, we just played the game before the show to freshen the mind.

465
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:35,220
Rym: Yep as a bad tactical decision.

466
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:37,887
Rym: Uh, we both had our tens were both dead.

467
00:32:37,928 --> 00:32:45,396
Rym: double suicide because while it was not likely that I was going to lose my ten And he wouldn't there was a small chance and I decided it wasn't worth the risk.

468
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:46,120
Rym: So I suicided.

469
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,660
Scott: Yeah, we both basically had our spies right there waiting.

470
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:55,340
Scott: So if one if either one of us decided to move the ten forward and actually start killing things.

471
00:32:55,983 --> 00:32:59,199
Scott: That person would have been screwed because their ten would have been lost right away.

472
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:03,920
Scott: But at the same time pulling back the ten wouldn't have worked so well either.

473
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,100
Scott: So it's sort of like the left side of the board was locked up with the tens and the spies not moving at all.

474
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,535
Rym: Yep, so it came down then that we both had a nine.

475
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:16,897
Rym: I Sent my nine up to clear out all of Scott's resistance.

476
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:18,968
Rym: now My nine was so far away.

477
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:28,660
Rym: Scott sent his down to clear up my resistance But because of the way I was set up I couldn't very easily counter his guy there and I ended up losing as a result.

478
00:33:29,013 --> 00:33:31,489
Scott: Yeah he sent his nine down like the left side.

479
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,212
Scott: where am I?

480
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:44,520
Scott: the board was sort of crowded and I Moved my guys in a way So that you know He would constantly like have two different guys to go after and there were guys in his way And it just made it difficult for him to move.

481
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:52,048
Scott: I sent my nine right down the side and I had scouts there checking in front of him all the time so that he was Able to just go go go go go.

482
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:54,720
Scott: I found the miner and then I found the bomb.

483
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,072
Scott: I sent the miner straight down the right side of the map.

484
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:58,780
Scott: Just click click click click click click click click.

485
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:02,460
Rym: Yep And there was my critical error because the nine was out of the way and I had an eight.

486
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:07,100
Rym: But the eight was trapped on the other side of a bomb and I could have gotten him over there.

487
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,844
Rym: But it was there was.

488
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:10,920
Rym: I didn't have time to get him over there because I had to move another piece out of the way.

489
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:25,000
Rym: I left a piece in a place that prevented my eight from defending against his miners And I had no other pieces in the area that could attack the miner other than my own miner Which he had another miner ready and that's actually how I got rid of his first miner.

490
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:31,440
Scott: Yeah, I'd actually at the end of the game I had lost all my miners because he got him all but nine was there.

491
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,612
Scott: So I just moved the nine in and I the miner had cleared out.

492
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:41,840
Rym: just I would have been I would have been guaranteed to win Except that I had left one hole in my bomb defense.

493
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:49,480
Scott: So the miner I cleared out just enough bombs and then my nine was able to just walk in and take the flag.

494
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,540
Scott: Yeah, he had one more bomb or moved a bomb, you know in a different direction?

495
00:34:54,023 --> 00:34:54,748
Scott: Oh, that would have been it.

496
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:56,219
Scott: I would have had a little trouble there.

497
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:59,414
Scott: But I did have an eight waiting the whole game in the corner.

498
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:00,800
Scott: I didn't touch him.

499
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:06,600
Scott: I resisted the urge to move that eight for so long just in case we both had the eights ready to go.

500
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:08,768
Scott: I know but mine wasn't trapped by bombs.

501
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:10,855
Scott: He was in the corner wide open.

502
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:11,177
Scott: He wasn't

503
00:35:11,237 --> 00:35:24,197
Rym: trapped by bombs He was just there's a bomb and like a five in his way It would have taken like three rounds to get the five far enough out of the way to bring him in and you would have Gone after the five and then your nine would come over.

504
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:28,380
Scott: Yep That's another advantage of I think of sending the twos out right away.

505
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:35,870
Scott: Is that if I need to like pull the spy out of like a crevice I can do that more easily Because all these twos are dead at the beginning of the game.

506
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:37,498
Scott: I've cleared out like five spaces.

507
00:35:37,518 --> 00:35:45,920
Rym: see I'll also opt to often lose pieces But I have to lose the sergeants the ones just of course those seven for the most useless pieces in the game.

508
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:47,950
Scott: Yeah, the fours are pretty.

509
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,820
Rym: I pretty much load up my front lines with him.

510
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:52,413
Rym: I send them forward to be effectively scouts.

511
00:35:52,895 --> 00:35:53,820
Rym: They eventually die.

512
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:58,820
Rym: I've freed up my lines almost as well and now right behind them are all my scouts.

513
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:00,745
Rym: Well half my scouts.

514
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:09,411
Rym: I always keep one Scout one minor and one eight hidden together Somewhere like out of the way for an emergency.

515
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:12,380
Rym: win the game like send a scout up to grab the flag or something.

516
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:26,780
Scott: Yeah, see what I actually do is since there's three pathways connecting the two sides You know with the water in between as I jet I make three three forces, you know They have powerful guys in the front but with you know scouts Powerful guys miners, you know.

517
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:37,040
Scott: So my front lines are scouts powerful guys miners in each of the three columns And then I hide the bombs and the flag somewhere in the rear way back, you know that way.

518
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:56,489
Scott: You know if his flag happens to be in the left in the middle or in the right I have guys there ready to go in at you know that part of the map and go get him because you know sometimes the game could just come down to you know, I. So it took too long for me to go over and get it.

519
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,648
Scott: this way I can go in on the left and if I've Gotten deep and there's no flag.

520
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:06,458
Scott: I can just forget that and go in from the right You know, which is much closer than going all the way across the board.

521
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:22,026
Rym: Yep I think in terms of zones of control and I'll generally put my Nine and my one actually kind of close together is that I have a powerhouse where my nine can kick ass yet I've got the ten there to back him up and then the other side will be kind of eights I always have.

522
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,720
Rym: one area was really poorly defended.

523
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:28,900
Scott: See, I don't really eat the way that they're trying to keep it even here's the reason I do that.

524
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:30,808
Rym: Like there are three basic pathways.

525
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:39,269
Rym: So by loading up two of them I'm basically saying if Scott attacks from those two I'm going to win.

526
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:46,697
Rym: if Scott attacks on my week one I'm going to lose but I give myself almost a two-thirds chance of winning instead of a 50% chance.

527
00:37:47,822 --> 00:37:48,123
Scott: Perhaps.

528
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:51,680
Scott: the other thing though is I think why that fails you is because I don't really attack.

529
00:37:52,460 --> 00:38:00,875
Scott: I Kind of wait I get hit a little bit to see what's there and then once I see what's there I push in right where I see the weak spot.

530
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:03,420
Scott: Well, I always It's like a counter punch.

531
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:09,800
Rym: I always put all my strong guys back a bit But the thing is that often I often do win with that because I didn't do that in the game.

532
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,770
Rym: We just played in the game.

533
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,293
Rym: We just played.

534
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:22,238
Rym: I did a completely different strategy Where I put the ten by himself with the spy and then on the other side I spread all my other powerful guys out in an actually a very carefully arranged array.

535
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:26,474
Scott: Yeah Anyway, as you can see Stratego is a pretty good game.

536
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:30,212
Rym: It's not the greatest game ever But there's a lot more to it than you might think.

537
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:31,480
Scott: there is a lot to it, you know.

538
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,731
Scott: And you know, it's pretty fun to have a have this army.

539
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:37,500
Scott: you arrange the army any way you want.

540
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,720
Scott: You could put all your bombs in the front line, but then you'd lose immediately because you couldn't move anybody.

541
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:44,120
Scott: But you know you can you know.

542
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,640
Scott: Arrange these guys in any way you want and then you fight two armies against each other quite directly.

543
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,989
Scott: Yeah, almost as if in a real battle.

544
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:53,254
Rym: It's very fun.

545
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:54,379
Rym: There's a lot you still think.

546
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:59,120
Rym: a lot I mean, there's a lot to think and consider about and you do make a lot of fairly important strategic decisions.

547
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:05,666
Scott: I think the biggest advantage that this game has is that it's a non Random two-player game.

548
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:17,372
Scott: There are very few two-player games that aren't just asked and it bluntly and it's cheap and People can play it even if they aren't super gamers, you know I know we I have friends that really aren't way gamers dude.

549
00:39:17,392 --> 00:39:19,900
Rym: I used to play this game with my entire family.

550
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:22,371
Scott: Yeah, I mean what kind of game can you say?

551
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:24,460
Scott: What are their army military war game?

552
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,352
Scott: Can you say that the fan the whole family will enjoy it?

553
00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:31,825
Rym: Not many, you know I'm surprised Jack Thompson isn't going after these violent board games.

554
00:39:32,025 --> 00:39:33,187
Scott: Yeah, I know freaking.

555
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:37,869
Scott: I've learned so much about Battle strategy from playing Stratego.

556
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,020
Scott: you think if I just got a bunch of my friends together

557
00:39:41,404 --> 00:39:41,586
Rym: With

558
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:42,760
Scott: my military strategy

559
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:56,240
Rym: I picture you standing there at the Crimean War and next to you is a bowling ball candle bomb and Behind that is your little flag and you've got a guy in a silly hat standing in front of you and you somehow think that You're invincible.

560
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:59,099
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much what it is.

561
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:07,029
Rym: But to me the greatest advantage of this game because we love incredibly horrid We need to make like a live-action Stratego video.

562
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,972
Rym: That'd be pretty funny.

563
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:10,180
Scott: Maybe here Larry's you got bowling ball candles and miners.

564
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,632
Rym: I think we'll have to look and see if someone's already done it or not.

565
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:14,300
Scott: Yeah, we will and no one.

566
00:40:14,484 --> 00:40:15,220
Scott: Oh, that's another thing.

567
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:24,174
Scott: I looked on the internet to see if there have been any other podcasts about Stratego ever and As far as I can tell there haven't been although it has been mentioned on some podcasts.

568
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:29,811
Scott: Like I think someone said Stratego once But no one's actually done a podcast about Stratego.

569
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:31,538
Scott: This is the first Stratego podcast.

570
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:34,608
Rym: everybody Yeah, but I mean there's fun strategy involved and all that.

571
00:40:34,648 --> 00:40:38,882
Rym: but most importantly the game is real quick to play like 10 minutes Maybe.

572
00:40:39,123 --> 00:40:42,360
Scott: well if you know how to play a lot dumb people might take too long.

573
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:47,335
Scott: But if you're playing with people who know what the hell they're doing the instructions say between 30 to 120 minutes.

574
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:53,660
Rym: Yeah In 120 minutes, we can almost knock off a game of Dracula.

575
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:57,232
Scott: Yeah, so this is you know it for smart people.

576
00:40:57,252 --> 00:41:01,226
Scott: This is a quick game and for not so smart people Not so smart,

577
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:16,983
Rym: I guess I mean there are a lot of throwaway decisions in the game like once you especially because it's very hard to very meticulously design your entire board especially with the physical game with the other guys sitting there watching you because you're so afraid that he's gonna See the order.

578
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:18,187
Rym: you put pieces out in

579
00:41:18,488 --> 00:41:37,180
Scott: and figure out like if what I generally do is I take all my pieces and I Put them out and then I just rearrange them if you just take them off the board Like if I just take the pieces and like huh Scott starting by building his you know Army from the rear left of the board where he built this triangle shape and then he's filling in the rest.

580
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,019
Scott: You know in columns and rows, I guess his bomb is in the rear left.

581
00:41:41,484 --> 00:41:43,903
Rym: Yeah, but even if you do it your way It's pretty cuz.

582
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:46,952
Rym: you're probably certain pieces depending on how it like.

583
00:41:46,992 --> 00:41:51,509
Rym: if I see you replace all the pieces in a certain area I'll depending on the area.

584
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:53,137
Rym: I'm usually pretty sure that's where your bomb is.

585
00:41:53,419 --> 00:41:56,280
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it's kind of tricky to set up.

586
00:41:56,501 --> 00:42:07,049
Scott: You know one thing you might want to do to be sure that no one's doing one guy sets up Then it leaves the room other guy comes in sets up Or you take a piece of paper you write down.

587
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,260
Rym: god, no, that's a terrible idea that would take forever.

588
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:11,836
Scott: It works, you know.

589
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:20,640
Scott: or you know if you have like pre-built Stratego Maps Like I could sit down one day and prepare like four or five Stratego's and just come out and put one together.

590
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:30,980
Rym: In my eyes the best way to set the game up physically is to take all the pieces off put them face down on your Side shuffle them up and then flip them all up in a row and then just start building in a random order.

591
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:31,783
Scott: Yep, that's it.

592
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:33,710
Scott: That's generally what we do and it works out.

593
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,640
Scott: There's no one ever knows exactly where the other guy's flag is.

594
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,657
Scott: I mean whenever a guy is moving around down in the rear, you know lanes of the other guy's board.

595
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:44,639
Scott: They're like Hope it's not a bomb.

596
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:48,229
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I guess the game is very simple.

597
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,806
Rym: The game is not terribly mentally challenging at all though It is more strategic than say.

598
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:54,829
Rym: What was that?

599
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:56,073
Rym: camels through the desert game?

600
00:42:56,113 --> 00:42:56,574
Rym: We played.

601
00:42:56,594 --> 00:43:01,247
Rym: Oh, I forget Timbuktu Timbuktu Timbuktu which was just a nothing game.

602
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:01,588
Scott: Yeah.

603
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,634
Rym: Yeah, there's enough to it to where.

604
00:43:03,674 --> 00:43:04,818
Rym: don't underestimate this game.

605
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:05,299
Rym: Mm-hmm.

606
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:10,157
Scott: So yeah, Stratego is a Milton Bradley game for your family two players.

607
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:10,760
Scott: It's fun.

608
00:43:11,262 --> 00:43:14,480
Scott: You can actually get this nice wooden version now if you really like it.

609
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,199
Scott: You should pay for that because it's way cool.

610
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:19,740
Scott: But if not, I recommend you get the wicked stupid cheap.

611
00:43:20,021 --> 00:43:23,920
Scott: You know $10 or probably less than $10 version that we have now.

612
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,080
Rym: I like how Wikipedia says that this game has medium rules complexity and high strategic depth.

613
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,680
Scott: They don't know what the hell they're talking about.

614
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,560
Rym: I mean, I guess it has high strategic depth compared to every other Milton Bradley game except for I don't know Shogun.

615
00:43:39,305 --> 00:43:43,247
Scott: Yeah Wonder what board game geek says.

616
00:43:43,468 --> 00:43:57,639
Scott: board game geek is at 5.9 out of 10 stars and the only other information I see about it besides factual information is That there's an article that says you can't go wrong with Stratego, which is you know, you really can't go wrong.

617
00:43:58,586 --> 00:43:59,700
Rym: We played this game to death.

618
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:10,736
Rym: I mean playing the game is not really a matter of who's smarter or who's more strategic But it's more a matter of the luck of who set up what kind of thing and how it plays out and there's not much To it anymore, but it's still fun to play.

619
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:11,627
Scott: Mm-hmm.

620
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:17,170
Scott: Yeah board game geek says it's a medium light to light game Whatever.

621
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:25,220
Rym: Yeah Yeah, yeah go Wikipedia, I think you know, there's all these initiatives like the heavy metal improvement initiative.

622
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,260
Rym: I think we need the board game article improvement initiative.

623
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:30,045
Scott: Yeah, they should just sort of make.

624
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:35,400
Scott: someone should write a script that can turn a board game geek page into a Wikipedia page.

625
00:44:36,144 --> 00:44:43,220
Scott: You know and then at least to the you know How some of the pages have that big bar on the right with all the you know vital information.

626
00:44:44,263 --> 00:44:49,880
Scott: It should just loot board game geek for the vital information on the right side of the Wikipedia page and then you write an article.

627
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:50,582
Rym: Yeah, let me like.

628
00:44:50,603 --> 00:44:57,479
Rym: I'm looking through these strategy listed in the Wikipedia article and it's pretty much just logical obvious answer.

629
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,884
Rym: Logical obvious thing.

630
00:44:59,904 --> 00:45:11,199
Rym: there are no obvious obvious obvious thing during gameplay players must identify bombs without Sacrificing too many troops determine the probable location of the enemy flag form an attack plan.

631
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:15,040
Rym: Yeah, yeah misdirection plays a role as well.

632
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:25,290
Scott: Yeah, look at this, you know, it's got an average rating of five point eight seven, but on board game geek 1916 people own the game.

633
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:26,757
Scott: that tells you something.

634
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:31,180
Scott: Yep You know, no one's gonna say it's the best game ever like Puerto Rico or anything.

635
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:35,613
Scott: But everyone's got it and people tend to like it and they play.

636
00:45:35,653 --> 00:45:36,696
Rym: Yeah, unlike other games.

637
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,301
Rym: Everyone owns like monopoly This game is actually fun.
