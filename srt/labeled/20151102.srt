1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,640
Rym: It's Monday November 2nd 2015.

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,327
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:19,102
Rym: Don't drop your phone Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:27,650
Rym: So, uh, Emily and I kind of went to Disney for didn't extended period didn't any world?

5
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:35,580
Rym: There is a. there's a wedding of some friends that I kind of Sort of booked and did the thing all at the last minute Like I booked flights like a week before.

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,051
Scott: it's not a hard place to go to Disney world Didn't he?

7
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,643
Scott: world and Vegas are like the two easiest places to go to you.

8
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:44,709
Rym: like you can go whenever the hell you want I'm gonna say that Vegas is easier to go to than didn't it?

9
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:52,150
Scott: I mean if you have I'm just saying like if you have money and You can go like at the drop of a hat you can get on a plane and get a hotel at either of those locations.

10
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,635
Rym: Yeah, so so.

11
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:58,450
Rym: actually though we got to stay because the wedding was for a military family.

12
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:04,956
Rym: We got to stay at a resort that is otherwise only accessible to Military people.

13
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:05,482
Scott: that's cool.

14
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:06,450
Rym: Yeah shades of green.

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:14,743
Rym: It's like right in the park next to the Polynesian and ever knew it existed and it was actually kind of cool Except we had to show a special ID card the whole time.

16
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:18,789
Rym: We were there to get back into the facility Okay, but otherwise, it was great.

17
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:25,606
Rym: well The pavilion do a special show where we'll review Didney world because we've just been there now and I got a lot to say there in the 90s.

18
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,573
Rym: Yeah, we do a three-way show.

19
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:33,832
Rym: the three of us because I got I got updates like some things have changed and some things have not Changed.

20
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:36,645
Rym: and the only thing I want to say this relevant to Monday GeekNights.

21
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:40,059
Rym: Is that Universal Studios has an app for like.

22
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,110
Rym: hey, I'm at Universal Studios and it's awesome.

23
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,459
Rym: Didney has an app for I'm at didn't?

24
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,001
Scott: it sucks.

25
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:48,146
Scott: It's garbage.

26
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:49,129
Rym: Okay, it has.

27
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:53,810
Scott: One of the worst UX is you should figure out which companies that hired to make each app.

28
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,650
Scott: I mean, they're super higher than one.

29
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:00,449
Rym: They're so superficially similar and like the way they're laid out that I actually suspect they're made by the same company.

30
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:06,034
Rym: But like in the didney app if you want to see the map of the park You're in.

31
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:07,929
Rym: that's actually really hard to do.

32
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,096
Scott: That's the most important thing.

33
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:11,511
Scott: and if you don't have to carry on a stupid paper map with me And

34
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:19,901
Rym: if you want to do a fast pass of like hey I want to ride Space Mountain and then it'll tell you like alright come back at one and you can skip most of the line And do like a quick thing, which they do.

35
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:20,203
Rym: It's free.

36
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:24,785
Rym: Yeah Good luck getting the app to actually set that up for you.

37
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:25,750
Scott: Here's what I don't understand.

38
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,518
Scott: You need it back in the day.

39
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:30,230
Scott: Yeah, but it is, you know technology related, right?

40
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,295
Scott: So I went to didn't?

41
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:32,241
Scott: he rolled the 90s.

42
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:40,582
Rym: I went to did knee in 97 and when I went in like 89 sure and I wanted to go on the Splash Mountain I just got in line and waited like three hours.

43
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:41,346
Scott: I didn't wait three hours.

44
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:42,090
Scott: I went a good time.

45
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,439
Scott: I waited like less than an hour.

46
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:44,949
Rym: Well, cuz the lines got stuff going on.

47
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,069
Scott: Yeah, and then I did a little Splash Mountain and I was on my way.

48
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:51,001
Scott: But nowadays I get a little line to Splash Mountain.

49
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:51,925
Scott: I get to the top.

50
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:55,490
Scott: I got this phone I do not want to take with me on the Splash Mountain.

51
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:59,890
Scott: Yeah So where the fuck do you put your phone if you go to Disney World when you splash on the mountain?

52
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,223
Scott: And how do you get it back when you've done splashing?

53
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:03,310
Rym: so at Universal?

54
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,640
Rym: There are lockers outside of every ride that are free and fingerprint controlled.

55
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:07,462
Scott: That's pretty good.

56
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:15,894
Rym: at other resorts like Cedar Point There's lockers on the platforms that you just put your stuff in and then when you come back on the ride You take your stuff out.

57
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:16,980
Scott: You hope no one takes your shit.

58
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:17,845
Rym: They keep an eye on it.

59
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:21,222
Scott: Like it's usually fine Does it say leave your stuff here your own risk?

60
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:22,588
Rym: So that was never a problem for me.

61
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:27,396
Rym: Also, if you're going to it, I mean honestly Most rides at did knee.

62
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:31,150
Rym: in fact, I'd say every ride at did knee you can just keep your phone in pocket.

63
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,878
Scott: Yeah, I think you can take your phone on the teacups.

64
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:39,322
Rym: It's the only thing on every roller coaster and did knee Just fine from a don't lose your phone perspective except the Splash Mountain.

65
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:41,128
Rym: You know what Splash Mountain?

66
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:41,850
Rym: your phone would be fine.

67
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:43,079
Rym: You don't get that wet.

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,844
Scott: you get pretty wet.

69
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:44,610
Scott: Don't get that wet.

70
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,743
Scott: It's not called Dries Bone Mountain or Desert Island Mountain.

71
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,935
Rym: It's Splash Mountain not Drench Mountain Not.

72
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:55,470
Rym: uh, oh, what's the name of the Russian roulette thing at Cedar Point?

73
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:59,788
Scott: Did you go to Universal Studios or did you go to the Adventure Island?

74
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:00,170
Scott: Both!

75
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,750
Rym: Okay, because there's Halloween shit going down.

76
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:13,797
Rym: So we went to Universal Studios for like the whole day and then at five they basically kicked everybody out Because starting at seven until midnight It was special haunted Jason vs.

77
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:15,923
Rym: Freddy like fucked up nightmare land.

78
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,869
Rym: Okay, which actually looked really cool.

79
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,016
Scott: Why did you go to that?

80
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:21,410
Rym: Because instead we you know, we didn't only had a few days.

81
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:30,290
Rym: so instead we went over to Islands of Adventure and Rode the dragon challenge a bunch of times because that's that's the twin rollercoasters used to be dueling dragons.

82
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,983
Rym: Yeah, it is so in all that's pretty good in all of like.

83
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,910
Scott: did you ride the Incredible Hulk that sneakily?

84
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,460
Rym: No, it's fucking shut down and they've torn half of it apart.

85
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,283
Rym: They're renovating it.

86
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,030
Scott: Oh, did you ride the spider-man ride?

87
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:46,444
Scott: No, but I rode the Simpsons ride which that was not there when I went there.

88
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:47,005
Scott: Yeah.

89
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:47,266
Rym: Yeah.

90
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:51,176
Rym: So, you know what the Simpsons ride is Kind of amazing.

91
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:51,980
Rym: That's a spider-man.

92
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:54,373
Scott: The spider-man ride was amazing in the 90s I'm sure.

93
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:56,403
Scott: I'm sure the Simpsons ride is the MGM.

94
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,650
Rym: back to the future ride.

95
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:57,951
Rym: We're.

96
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:00,990
Scott: no that way ghetto because it's super old was way amazing.

97
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,832
Scott: They updated it.

98
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:07,670
Rym: Oh, let me tell you the the technology the Harry Potter area was off the fucking hook.

99
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,259
Scott: Well that used to be generic fantasy area with the dragons.

100
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,528
Rym: there are two Harry Potter places.

101
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:14,570
Scott: when I was there It was a generic fantasy area.

102
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:25,798
Rym: Yeah, it is kind of off the hook, but the the sort of rollercoaster 4d ish rides that are the Harry Potter at the two sides way Impressive from a tech standpoint.

103
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:27,985
Scott: Did they have this other Popeye water ride there?

104
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:28,446
Scott: They change.

105
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:29,630
Rym: I saw that we didn't ride it.

106
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,177
Scott: That's a really good water ride.

107
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,130
Scott: you get in a giant tube and it goes all over and you know what?

108
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:35,509
Scott: You can't bring your phone on.

109
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,823
Rym: But it was interesting because honestly there are only a handful of roller coasters in the entire.

110
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:45,593
Rym: did the universal area that are on par With.

111
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:46,497
Rym: what about?

112
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:47,521
Scott: it's a theme park.

113
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:49,350
Scott: It's not a thrill park exactly.

114
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:57,770
Rym: They have fun thrills but not a lot dueling dragons the Hulk which I didn't ride The Hollywood rocket in Universal which I didn't ride as a kid because I guess it wasn't there.

115
00:05:57,993 --> 00:05:58,969
Scott: I don't know what that is.

116
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,410
Rym: So it's actually a legit roller coaster.

117
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:06,913
Rym: But it's weird because it wasn't like the kinds of roller coasters I'm familiar with.

118
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:12,730
Rym: so I went and looked up the deal because like there's only like three or four companies that make legit roller coasters.

119
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,217
Rym: There's Intamin there's aerodynamics.

120
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:16,620
Rym: There's the M&B.

121
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:17,603
Rym: That's pretty much it.

122
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:22,952
Rym: Like no one else makes roller coasters worth a shit and I Couldn't like.

123
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:24,799
Rym: I know a lot about roller coasters.

124
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,906
Rym: like Emily started to learn that I'm that guy.

125
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:31,109
Rym: if roller coasters come up Like let me tell you about a guy who's more that guy than you.

126
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:33,522
Rym: I you know, I thought that but there's only a few.

127
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:34,849
Rym: I'm actually kind of up there.

128
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,558
Rym: But the roller coaster was weird.

129
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:44,020
Rym: So finally like we're having drinks later and I went on Wikipedia and I'm looking up the deal Universal apparently made this thing on their own.

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,270
Rym: It was like an outsider roller coaster.

131
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:53,963
Rym: So that's why it didn't have like the normal roller coaster tropes and it did weird stuff that for good reasons other roller coasters Don't do.

132
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:56,596
Rym: It was fun, but it was weird.

133
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:58,061
Scott: Did you go to Epcot land?

134
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:00,310
Scott: Yeah, go to the back where all the countries are.

135
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,063
Scott: There's a Viking boat ride still there that was shut down.

136
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:05,047
Rym: we couldn't ride it.

137
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,338
Scott: No Viking boat Time.

138
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,730
Rym: I was like, there's this log flume like.

139
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,919
Rym: I kept looking for it.

140
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,969
Rym: And then finally we figured out that it's just shut down.

141
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,965
Rym: There was a food festival going on so independent.

142
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,355
Scott: it's always a food Double food festival.

143
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,519
Rym: So there's double food.

144
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:26,703
Rym: So there's normal Epcot, right?

145
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,670
Scott: I have the food of every country in each country.

146
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,535
Scott: Yes, that's the point.

147
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:36,763
Rym: So in between all the countries that have been there forever They added twice as many little countries that were just a food pop-up stand.

148
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,929
Rym: So twice as much food.

149
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,148
Scott: Is figment still there?

150
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,635
Rym: I learned a lot about figment.

151
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:44,639
Scott: We uh, figment's my boy.

152
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,707
Rym: Emily had this vague memory of figment.

153
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:50,077
Rym: Figment's my boy And the little squares you jump on at the end.

154
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:52,484
Rym: Yeah, so Emily had this vague memory of that.

155
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,650
Scott: So I remember figment very clearly.

156
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:05,735
Rym: Yeah, so Imagination The moral of figment was basically hey, I'm science dad here to teach you about science and figments like oh fuck No, you're not.

157
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:07,124
Rym: I'm gonna fart all over everybody.

158
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:07,728
Scott: That's right.

159
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,589
Rym: So I think we'll do a show on Disney separately.

160
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,918
Scott: But seriously the dragon what's?

161
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:15,443
Scott: no another there's no other dragons.

162
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:17,490
Scott: I mean Pete's dragon doesn't even really show up at Disney World.

163
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:18,735
Rym: I know they should bring that back.

164
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:20,985
Rym: Dueling dragons is there but that's Harry Potter.

165
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:21,427
Scott: That's not even.

166
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:23,215
Scott: that's not Disney World It's universal.

167
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:24,701
Rym: it's all the same thing as far as I'm concerned.

168
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:26,610
Scott: It's two completely different companies have nothing to do with each other.

169
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,127
Rym: Yeah, but I mean you're talking about different parks.

170
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,870
Scott: because Is that Nickelodeon's thing still universal?

171
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:34,058
Rym: MGM which is now Disney Hollywood Studios.

172
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,462
Rym: Those are also separate parks.

173
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:38,390
Scott: So well the MGM is part of Disney World.

174
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:38,912
Scott: Well, no.

175
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,700
Rym: Yeah, but it's a separate park with a separate ticket.

176
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,524
Scott: It's always been a separate park.

177
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:42,808
Rym: I know but now it's not MGM.

178
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:49,550
Scott: Now the thing is when you go to Disney World You're supposed to buy the three park ticket and you could take the monorail to go between the three parks.

179
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,714
Rym: You can the park hopper.

180
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:51,477
Rym: I know all about that.

181
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,108
Scott: Is it the same old-ass monorail from like the 60s unchanged?

182
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,435
Scott: Yeah, it's a good monorail.

183
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,610
Rym: I also learned a lot about the monorail and how that technology.

184
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:04,499
Rym: so I was looking up like who's died at Disney and I found the monorail article.

185
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:17,490
Rym: and apparently in the 80s one of the cars caught on fire and almost killed everybody on it and apparently some dead like Fucking kicked the windows out and pulled everyone to safety on the roof and they hid from the fire and took like some crazy.

186
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:19,158
Scott: How did they get onto the roof of the monorail?

187
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:20,504
Rym: Yeah, some crazy crap went down.

188
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:21,790
Rym: apparently there's a Wikipedia article about it.

189
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,529
Scott: I mean if you go out the window of the monorail, you're going down.

190
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:24,835
Rym: Yeah, it's not that tall.

191
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,860
Rym: You could get off of that.

192
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,814
Rym: You could jump from that and maybe break a leg But otherwise be okay.

193
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,900
Rym: You could hit the trees.

194
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,403
Scott: It's high up.

195
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:31,590
Scott: At least I remember it being high up.

196
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,132
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

197
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:36,167
Rym: I remember a lot of things being way higher up and bigger that I went back as an adult.

198
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:37,253
Rym: Not so big Okay.

199
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,792
Rym: Anyway, the Disney app Garbage.

200
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,704
Rym: If you want to navigate around Disney, just use Google Maps.

201
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:44,547
Scott: Oh, Google Maps?

202
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:45,230
Scott: Not a paper map?

203
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:46,216
Rym: No, just use Google Maps.

204
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,088
Scott: Google Maps has like all the rides and everything?

205
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:49,956
Scott: Yeah Pretty good.

206
00:09:49,976 --> 00:09:51,790
Rym: So you got any tech news?

207
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,452
Scott: Not really.

208
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:58,206
Scott: This is non tech news, but our friends are non friends at anonymous.

209
00:09:58,547 --> 00:09:59,670
Rym: Some of them might be our friends.

210
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,414
Rym: I mean anonymous.

211
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:02,585
Rym: I mean, I'm an anonymous I guess.

212
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:17,010
Scott: Sure, whatever They are doing this thing where they are releasing the identities of thousands of people in the KKK Supposedly they got it from like hacking a Twitter account and like following threads from that.

213
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,604
Scott: So the official statement that well the statement that somebody made who claims to be

214
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:23,750
Rym: all statements from anonymous or official statements

215
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:46,838
Scott: Obviously, yes They're basically saying look We're not doing this because of what you believe because obviously anonymous super believes in freedom of speech even racist speech Which we also believe in the big nights but the KKK was threatening or at least some KKK people were threatening to engage violently in Ferguson protests, you know because they're the KKK.

216
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:53,321
Rym: Well because the KKK has a history of one being a bunch of racist dickbags, but Has a history of they are.

217
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:54,789
Scott: that is there as what they are.

218
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:04,064
Rym: But secondly also as a history of people who go to packs of a history of being gamers But it's also as a history of being a straight up Rym and Scott of a history of being podcast.

219
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:07,617
Rym: Ah, yeah, but a straight-up Terrorist organization.

220
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:08,079
Scott: Sure.

221
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,630
Scott: So so they're like, but because you are gonna be violent.

222
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:15,570
Scott: That's why we're gonna attack you and you know, what a plus.

223
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:18,766
Scott: Let's find out who these kke people are and make their lives miserable.

224
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:25,890
Rym: now The the nuance is it's a leak from anonymous which could be basically some guy.

225
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,710
Rym: Yeah so Some comes down to you on the internet things like corroborating evidence because I poked around the leak and a lot of those addresses are dot.

226
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,675
Rym: Are you addresses?

227
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:35,626
Rym: which is already a little odd?

228
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:39,590
Scott: People are getting Russian email addresses to hide themselves.

229
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:41,778
Rym: I would not suspect them to be that smart.

230
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:46,577
Rym: and the other part of this is that ice it looks like a lot of the Phone numbers are also complete bogus.

231
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:49,168
Rym: Like a lot of merges fax machines like random companies.

232
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:51,616
Rym: So I'll wait for this to be vetted.

233
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:54,970
Scott: The point is even whether it's the information is accurate, right?

234
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,130
Scott: I want you know, a lot of people are saying well look at this here, right?

235
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,883
Scott: We don't like the KKK But we also don't like revealing people's identities and which I also.

236
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:08,896
Rym: that's a conflict that I have in my day-to-day Life and their personal information.

237
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:16,969
Scott: and they're like, you know, it's not cool if you go and put like, you know Say some feminist journalists information online so that people can harass her.

238
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:22,070
Scott: Why is it okay to put out the informationism KKK person to harass them?

239
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,401
Scott: And the answer I give to you is because principle is bullshit.

240
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:27,087
Scott: Who cares if it doesn't matter.

241
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:28,110
Scott: It's it's right.

242
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:33,550
Scott: It's like, you know, it's okay to kill some horribly sick and old person who's suffering.

243
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,376
Scott: It's not okay to kill some young and healthy.

244
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:36,038
Rym: Wait, wait, Scott.

245
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:39,790
Scott: You're perfectly okay to make the life of some KKK dickbag miserable.

246
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:42,586
Scott: It's not okay to make the life of a good person miserable.

247
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:43,956
Scott: It's all doing that.

248
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,630
Rym: Situations require a nuanced and individual approach when making decisions.

249
00:12:51,032 --> 00:13:01,590
Scott: You don't say but there seems to be like people on the internet Especially people who like to argue on the internet like they can't escape Principle like they're like there would be like especially like libertarian types.

250
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:11,628
Scott: It's like they're like freedom and it's like they'll come across an issue and they apply their principle to it And even if they like don't agree with something like racism or you know, whatever it is, right?

251
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:14,502
Scott: They can't you know, they're like, oh my god, it'll be.

252
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:15,146
Scott: it's like.

253
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:22,591
Scott: well, it depends like Reverse cognitive dissonance like for example dissonance is when you contradict yourself, but you don't realize it You can't.

254
00:13:22,672 --> 00:13:24,117
Scott: it's it right your brain is separating.

255
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:24,960
Scott: It's like the opposite.

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,381
Scott: It's like you.

257
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:33,015
Scott: you have to be consistent every time By being inconsistent Recognizing it and not giving it.

258
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:40,157
Rym: there's a way to get around there without being inconsistent and it's to have a complex Philosophical and ideological heuristic.

259
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:41,943
Rym: I mean my state.

260
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:45,842
Rym: I take a very absolutist stance on free speech Like I'm a radical.

261
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:50,664
Rym: when it comes to free speech I think that's probably the most one of the most important rights that humans have.

262
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:58,599
Rym: but at the same time I'm pretty okay with for example a university saying the MRAs can't have their club.

263
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,949
Rym: sure and I can back that up.

264
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:20,490
Rym: The problem is that people will make pronouncements like this from an ideological standpoint But they can't really argue their point that effectively because their point is actually very simple and thus very prone to holes that they then have to leap over with cognitive dissonance or Stubborn hobgoblin like fixation on a very simple idea.

265
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:22,796
Rym: Yes, so, you know what my stance on this is.

266
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:28,389
Rym: if the problem the problem is a leaks like this could be entirely fabricated to ruin someone's life.

267
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:34,208
Scott: yes, they could be but it's if someone is on the list who's not in the KKK that would be very very bad.

268
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:40,850
Rym: or if Lynch mobs appear on the internet the irony of saying it that way to go after like a gay rights activists.

269
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,034
Scott: That's not cool.

270
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:45,766
Scott: But yeah, Lynch mob appears to go after a KKK Lynch mob.

271
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:46,910
Scott: I'm down.

272
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:47,914
Scott: Let's all the fact.

273
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:48,817
Scott: I might even join up.

274
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,424
Rym: What if the lynch mob actually killed someone?

275
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:51,970
Scott: Is it a KKK person?

276
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,549
Rym: It's someone who was in the KKK at least within the last ten years.

277
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,636
Scott: Too regretful, I'm gonna put it this way.

278
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:04,344
Rym: this is a situation not feeling too bad about.

279
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:07,036
Rym: I'm gonna analogize this the way analogize Awesome graffiti.

280
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:18,143
Rym: if someone does some awesome graffiti and gets caught I feel like that they should still get fined for the graffiti But the judge should high-five them on their way to pay the fine.

281
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:19,607
Scott: don't high-five the KKK.

282
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:24,670
Rym: no no High five anonymous unless this leak is BS.

283
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:29,124
Scott: But yeah this kind of thing good that'd be a good deal.

284
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:30,430
Scott: right for every person on the list.

285
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:30,972
Scott: That's fake.

286
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,243
Scott: you get nothing for every person on the list.

287
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,730
Scott: That wasn't actually in the KKK.

288
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:40,870
Scott: We're gonna cane you once and for every person on the list who isn't a KKK We're gonna high-five you once and give you a cupcake.

289
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,216
Rym: There is a real interesting thing though.

290
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:51,829
Scott: with this sort of doxxing and information of We thought I mean it is free speech in and of itself to share information Even if it's someone's address and name and phone number.

291
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,056
Rym: But again this comes to the problem of.

292
00:15:54,116 --> 00:16:03,744
Rym: there were lines that existed solely because technology was inefficient in Distributing that information like if someone's in 1700 they didn't even have the telephone.

293
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:12,573
Rym: when they made the First Amendment in 1980 It was real hard to know if someone was a criminal or in the past or Had like what.

294
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:17,970
Rym: if someone's like family was murdered or something like details about someone's past like that person was abused as a kid or?

295
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:24,779
Rym: Something that information was in the public domain in some fashion but was obscured by poor technology.

296
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:32,050
Scott: you would have to go to different towns to the halls of records and Hang out with some detectives and some clerks and read a lot of shit.

297
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:38,170
Rym: It meant there was a lot of information that was technically public but actually required a lot of effort and will to uncover.

298
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:45,230
Rym: Technology has now made it such that it requires Minimal will and zero effort to uncover that kind of information.

299
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:51,941
Scott: I don't know how but see private investigators seem to be in more work lately and not less Which I think is just because people are incompetent at searching.

300
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:59,106
Rym: Yeah, like you know the KKK guys I'm pretty sure their password to the Twitter account, which is how they got all this info was something like white power 69 to probably.

301
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:03,215
Rym: So Yeah, if this is all legit.

302
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:06,544
Rym: I'm just gonna smirk and otherwise not really have a strong opinion.

303
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:07,686
Rym: Whatever happens happens.

304
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:13,750
Rym: So Something happened in Turkey and you're a lot of you probably have a gobble turkey time soon.

305
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,361
Scott: Thank to the economy a couple weeks away the turkey time.

306
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:18,189
Rym: I heard Christmas music today my way to work.

307
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:25,107
Scott: Yeah, I was expecting the lights to be already on the trees outside work today But they're actually a little bit later than last year.

308
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:28,810
Scott: last year I'm pretty sure it was November like first as soon as Halloween was over.

309
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,312
Rym: I'm waiting for.

310
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:34,610
Rym: the real day is the day Robert coup plays Christmas music in the penny arcade office tomorrow.

311
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,841
Rym: So Turkey is in the middle of political turmoil.

312
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,988
Rym: turmoil and Erdogan I guess won the big election.

313
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:44,115
Scott: but Who is that person?

314
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:45,560
Scott: Is that a good?

315
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,807
Scott: is that the person you would have voted for if you lived in Turkey?

316
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:48,750
Rym: my opinion?

317
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:49,549
Scott: No, okay.

318
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:50,734
Scott: So not good.

319
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:57,563
Rym: long story short the Turkish government decided to delay daylight saving time Because the election.

320
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,838
Scott: and fuck you Oh wait, oh so that the election.

321
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,330
Scott: so people wouldn't like miss the election because getting the times.

322
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,949
Rym: Well, there's a lot of argument as to what the actual rationale was but it's not the worst reason.

323
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:12,775
Scott: Oh, I mean if election day happens to be the day where you set the clock back A lot of people might miss.

324
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:16,490
Rym: they decided this like a few days like not that long ago.

325
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,680
Scott: This is something that's.

326
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,869
Scott: you got to play that in advance.

327
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:23,225
Scott: Yeah, so like last second the Turkish government said they like saving time delayed.

328
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:28,446
Rym: So alright My lot of you out there probably don't know how your computer knows daylight saving time.

329
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:29,229
Scott: because and TV?

330
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:33,083
Rym: No, and TV doesn't do that and TV has nothing to do with that.

331
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:42,250
Rym: So operating systems have Zone files that say it's just big text files that say these are all the time zones from UTC.

332
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,469
Scott: You got to get a Windows update.

333
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:45,750
Rym: Yeah You had to get a Windows update.

334
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:59,350
Rym: Your phone had to get an but it would only matter if you're lived in Turkey or you interact with anyone in Turkey or at Meeting in with a calendar anywhere in Turkey or relied on any server that was in Turkey visited a website of a person in Turkey.

335
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:03,470
Scott: I got even worse because and I'll link wanted to know who you wanted to buy something from there.

336
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:11,941
Rym: So this actually happens kind of often but it happens in Countries that don't understand technology and their governments make these.

337
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:13,305
Rym: but so here's the list.

338
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:19,420
Rym: I'm gonna link this to you because when this shit happens Weird shit goes down.

339
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:25,109
Scott: an example is Java Internally a tiny minuscule meaningless island with a funny name.

340
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:28,304
Rym: That's a good way to describe that programming language.

341
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:31,629
Rym: Hey, oh Has its own zone files?

342
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:41,549
Rym: So normally people just keep Java up-to-date, but if you're running like an enterprise application on a server somewhere You don't update Java just every time it comes down because you know Java breaks shit.

343
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:43,976
Rym: So usually stage that stuff in.

344
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:49,590
Rym: so if you use any libraries within Java that are aware of time zones.

345
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:55,970
Rym: They might find out what time zone or whatever from the system, but Java uses its own embedded stuff.

346
00:19:56,592 --> 00:20:02,570
Rym: So you either need to always keep your job a hundred percent up-to-date meaning when Turkey said we're gonna mess with the time for no good reason.

347
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:11,329
Rym: you'd better have gotten a Java update like immediately or Java might know a different time zone from your system.

348
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:16,126
Scott: Yeah, so in Ubuntu and most Linux systems that people are always who are made.

349
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:18,789
Scott: if your distro is maintained Somebody's updating the zone files.

350
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:26,659
Scott: so if you just keep getting updates automatically or by hand every day or whatever you're gonna get your updated zone files all the Time and almost all the software will use those own files.

351
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:32,095
Scott: However, let's say you got I don't know MySQL database Right MySQL database.

352
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:52,330
Scott: This is command called MySQL underscore TZ info underscore 2 as in TO Underscore SQL and what you do is you type this command then you press space Then you type in the path where your zone files are usually use your local like, you know zone file or whatever it is Right or use there's something local time.

353
00:20:52,475 --> 00:21:14,623
Scott: Yeah And it will read the zone files and then insert into a database in MySQL like the MySQL database inside your MySQL database server all that zone information and Then you can now if you once you've done this and you sort of filled up your MySQL database with zone information You can now convert times within MySQL itself like in a query.

354
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:32,470
Scott: you can be like TZ convert unders, you know, whatever Which is really freaking handy because you're gonna put all the times in your database are gonna be UTC Always if you're smart, right and then you can just do select Convert time zone New York comma time, you know, whatever and then your when your query results come out.

355
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,878
Scott: They'll already be New York time.

356
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,950
Scott: You won't have to do anything in your application.

357
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:37,702
Rym: How many of you who use my SQL?

358
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:38,789
Rym: I've ever heard any of this?

359
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:39,733
Scott: All right.

360
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:44,589
Scott: Anyway, yeah, let's say now there's an Ubuntu update for Turkey just happened, right?

361
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,669
Scott: Did you reload your MySQL time zone info?

362
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:50,929
Scott: Because it doesn't do it on its own.

363
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:59,937
Scott: Yeah, if you try to convert a turkey time zone with your database, even if you did this say a week ago or two weeks ago It's gonna get it wrong.

364
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:01,810
Rym: So with Java it's the same thing.

365
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,470
Rym: So earlier this year North Korea and Morocco both decided Morocco.

366
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,536
Rym: Yeah Morocco both decided to change.

367
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:11,163
Rym: Morocco mole their time stone stuff for no reason.

368
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:20,189
Rym: Egypt also did earlier this year multiple times and Mongolia, yeah, so Mongolian when North Korea?

369
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:30,410
Rym: If you had to deal with it You better have Java 6 105 Java 791 or Java 865 Installed if you want to deal with the turkey thing that just happened.

370
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:33,099
Rym: Well, no, there isn't even a Java update for it yet.

371
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,840
Rym: Meaning you get a run the TZ update Application which is included in your JRE.

372
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,229
Scott: It's a good thing that almost nobody has to deal with this.

373
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:44,930
Scott: So almost everyone only deals with UTC and their local time.

374
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,497
Scott: However, this only what.

375
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:52,890
Scott: if you went on a vacation to Turkey right now and brought your phone with you And you got off the plane you looked at your phone and go fuck you get the time wrong.

376
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:56,084
Rym: Young people explain on the way home, you know, it was trending in Turkey.

377
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:57,209
Rym: What time is it?

378
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,849
Rym: People are making fun of this all day.

379
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:06,566
Rym: yeah, but So the this pretty much only happens in countries that have bad tech governance.

380
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:11,250
Rym: or on Governance, I mean look Turkey North Korea, Morocco.

381
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:16,587
Scott: Here's the great government that is busy spending time messing with its time is a government that is not really good.

382
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:19,923
Rym: an individual Mexican state made a change at one point.

383
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:22,715
Scott: that actually affected me I mean, but in the u.s.

384
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:23,377
Scott: I can't even happen.

385
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:25,184
Scott: the federal government controls times.

386
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,010
Rym: Yeah NIST and everything, right?

387
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,745
Rym: So I'm gonna read to you the okay in Mexico.

388
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:30,569
Scott: They don't have it that way.

389
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:36,333
Rym: I'm gonna read you the update from the Moroccan one from TZ data 2015 e Quote.

390
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,740
Rym: Morocco will suspend DST from 2015.

391
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,062
Rym: Oh 614 3 a.m.

392
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:41,770
Rym: Through 2015.

393
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,935
Rym: Oh 719 2 a.m Not 613 and 718 as Guest.

394
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:48,775
Rym: They don't even maintain it.

395
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:56,529
Rym: the person who maintains the zone files in Java had guessed at what they were going to do And then the government did something different.

396
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:03,890
Rym: So yeah, you guys the moral of this news Is that a lot of the stuff on the back end of computers?

397
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,674
Scott: Well, as long as you haven't reached that time yet as long as like you have it Nothing's held yet.

398
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:12,170
Scott: You can guess and change the zone files as long as you don't reach that time.

399
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:15,790
Scott: Yeah, while you're wrong and you'll be okay, but all these updates?

400
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:22,950
Rym: There's no programmatic feed of this crap at the end somewhere in your Linux distro or in Java or in my SQL.

401
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:31,857
Rym: There's some dude like me who sees a government news release and says I'd better type a bunch of XML somewhere So other people can get that up.

402
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,425
Scott: There is the website.

403
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:34,329
Scott: that is the time news.

404
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:38,045
Rym: Yeah, so someone's got to type that into all these different systems.

405
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:45,780
Rym: Yeah things of the day.

406
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:50,260
Rym: So you remember twitch plays Pokemon, which was a beautiful beautiful thing.

407
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,519
Rym: You should go put watch like five minutes of it just to understand the glory of this.

408
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:56,380
Rym: Don't watch the whole thing unless you're crazy.

409
00:24:56,901 --> 00:25:07,937
Rym: but the idea was that twitch people could just type commands in and they collectively played Pokemon as though a million voices were Screaming at a screen and hitting buttons all at the same time and they did eventually beat the game.

410
00:25:07,997 --> 00:25:08,640
Rym: It was kind of crazy.

411
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:16,282
Rym: this my thing of the day is twitch installs Arch Linux and the most.

412
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:25,651
Rym: the best part about this is that a bunch of people organized a botnet and they Basically took over the stream and partially installed Gentoo instead.

413
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:25,751
Rym: Sure.

414
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:26,613
Scott: Why not?

415
00:25:27,355 --> 00:25:28,860
Rym: So I think this is wonderful.

416
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:32,420
Scott: Okay, do you know Todd Fry is Todd Fry?

417
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:37,955
Scott: No, Todd Fry is the person who made pac-man Oh for the Atari 2600.

418
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:40,949
Rym: Oh I saw a video.

419
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:42,437
Rym: Oh, I saw this video.

420
00:25:42,598 --> 00:25:48,674
Scott: Yes So this guy Todd Fry, you know, everyone knows pac-man for the Atari 2600 is not a good pac-man.

421
00:25:51,222 --> 00:25:58,800
Scott: it is the Atari 2600 was very limited in his technological capabilities and Could not produce the same pac-man that you played in the arcade.

422
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:00,746
Scott: Even the 7800 could only get close.

423
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:08,672
Scott: even the NES could only really get kind of close, you know for a lot of reasons I guess Super Nintendo could be perfect effectively mostly.

424
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:12,865
Scott: I'm sure some emulator nerds gonna be like no, it's off Bay You know, you got Mame.

425
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,135
Scott: it's fine close enough writing any s Galaga is an okay Galaga.

426
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:17,640
Scott: It's it's playable enough, right?

427
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,225
Rym: Atari pac-man was kind of infamous.

428
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:23,635
Scott: Sorry to Atari 2600 pac-man was bad, right?

429
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:25,601
Scott: You know, you don't want to play that It's not.

430
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:27,123
Scott: you know, it's not real pac-man.

431
00:26:27,163 --> 00:26:36,411
Scott: Anyway, so somebody of course, you know years having it been since the 80s made a demo of Atari 2600 pac-man.

432
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:43,598
Scott: They just coded it themselves from scratch and it was vastly superior to the to the official Atari 2600 pac-man.

433
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,375
Scott: It had the right colored goes linked a lot less.

434
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:48,500
Scott: it flickered a lot less.

435
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,000
Rym: And when he's when the guys to have the right had the right made the anti flicker algorithm that he came up with, right?

436
00:26:54,421 --> 00:27:06,207
Scott: So here at some convention or something, I don't know where this is Todd Fry the guy who made that old pac-man comes along and sees this demo of Somebody being like here's how you should have done it.

437
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:07,652
Scott: I'm better than you at programming.

438
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:12,713
Scott: take that Todd Fry and he's basically like wow Yeah, and he comments on it and he's like, holy shit.

439
00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:13,657
Scott: That's this video.

440
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:14,160
Scott: So watch this.

441
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,307
Scott: This reminds me a lot by the way 8k.

442
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:17,471
Scott: Imagine you have 8k.

443
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:18,796
Scott: You got to make pac-man happen.

444
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:19,438
Scott: That ain't easy.

445
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,959
Rym: Yeah That used to be considered a lot of memory to think about that.

446
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:28,215
Rym: fuck Now that's that's smaller than like a page.

447
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:31,083
Rym: Yeah, like that's You can.

448
00:27:31,164 --> 00:27:34,759
Scott: if you make a text file you can't address that little memory.

449
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:41,893
Scott: You just made 8k in like the space in the file system structure 8k.

450
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:44,560
Rym: you could type 8k of text and not that long.

451
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:52,382
Rym: Yeah, so this reminds me of that guy way back who took the code from ET and tweaked it to make ET Way better.

452
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:52,905
Rym: game too.

Rym: Anyway magfest is one of our favorite.

487
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,724
Scott: I'm saying it's so if it's sold out and they don't give me a badge You're not gonna hassle to go.

488
00:29:20,744 --> 00:29:21,066
Scott: get one.

489
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:22,552
Rym: I'll bet you could scalp one for cheap.

490
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:23,496
Scott: I'm not scalping.

491
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:25,180
Scott: Well, that's pain in the ass anyway.

492
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:28,046
Rym: That aside we've got a patreon.

493
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:44,195
Rym: now as we talked about and if we hit our first stretch goal, I am re-releasing remastered all the original beta pre-release episodes of GeekNights for Everyone, but the two people who have found them because they are I mean I've told people it's just like.

494
00:29:44,456 --> 00:29:48,978
Scott: it's seriously not hard to Find them if you just have common sense and whatever.

495
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,414
Scott: but Some people actually found them finally.

496
00:29:52,434 --> 00:29:55,365
Rym: Yeah, eventually we get a like Like other people.

497
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:58,876
Rym: Yeah, but I'm gonna re-release them with some commentary.

498
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:00,080
Rym: if we hit our first stretch goal.

499
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:03,800
Scott: I guess how you commentate on a podcast of two audio tracks overlapping.

500
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:10,239
Rym: I'm gonna listen to it and before you listen to the thing I'm gonna talk for like five minutes about like how we made it and all the stuff.

501
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,952
Scott: So you're gonna alternate between talking.

502
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:13,120
Rym: you know, no, I'm not gonna alternate.

503
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,173
Rym: I'm gonna do a five minute thing and then you're gonna hear the episode.

504
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,700
Rym: I'm not putting that much effort Jesus you kidding.

505
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:21,145
Rym: But yeah.

506
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:30,020
Rym: and go to check out the patreon because we got a bunch of stretch goals One of which is we'll both literally we're not joking quit our jobs and make it nice full-time.

507
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:31,678
Rym: I don't think we'll hit that stretch goal.

508
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,780
Rym: But I'll beyond all that listen to GeekNights after the credits because now I have to do a stinger.

509
00:30:39,642 --> 00:30:46,440
Rym: Every episode we do calling people out and doing something stupid and I have provided stupid things for every episode.

510
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:59,295
Rym: we've done okay, so a lot of people you know a lot of people we know a lot of people out there have smartphones with Shattered screens or other sorts of brokenness.

511
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:00,520
Rym: I mean you still use them.

512
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,623
Rym: They kind of work.

513
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:06,900
Rym: the batteries like dented the screen like there's an area on the touchscreen that doesn't work.

514
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:11,114
Rym: I know people have laptops were like half the screen literally doesn't display.

515
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:12,117
Scott: It's not just smartphones.

516
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,080
Scott: There's all kinds of stuff.

517
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,057
Scott: I mean you got people with like analog sticks and their controllers.

518
00:31:16,077 --> 00:31:24,091
Rym: this snap Dude brought a laptop to ConnectiCon to do a panel good panel like smart, dude but he goes to plug in his laptop and he's like the VGA.

519
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:32,375
Rym: or can I look at it and the VGA port is Battered beyond recognition and I was like, there's no way you're plugging a VGA cable into that.

520
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:34,200
Scott: Yeah people like cables that are all frayed.

521
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,439
Rym: Yeah, I see USB cables that are just a bunch of like the four internal wires kind of on their own.

522
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:43,352
Scott: Yeah, people with really dirty mice and keyboards are discussed.

523
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:44,577
Rym: We're not talking about dirt though.

524
00:31:44,617 --> 00:31:47,870
Scott: That's a whole Alright fine, they got one really cute.

525
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,613
Scott: some keys don't work.

526
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,300
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

527
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,976
Rym: Yeah, I I've seen mice where a key doesn't work and people are totally okay with that.

528
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:58,008
Rym: Whoa So how does this happen?

529
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,880
Scott: people just don't take care of their shit, right?

530
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,525
Scott: It's like let's say I gave you Rym.

531
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,354
Scott: how much how much is your phone worth on the market?

532
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:11,526
Rym: my phone like a hundred and fifty Bucks, it's an old like nicely working Hundred fifty dollar phone.

533
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:14,635
Scott: What if I gave you a vase like a porcelain vase?

534
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:16,400
Scott: That was a hundred and fifty dollars worth.

535
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,268
Scott: How would you treat that vase?

536
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:20,320
Rym: I'd sell it immediately because vases are stupid.

537
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,345
Scott: You wanted a vase.

538
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:22,968
Scott: you had some flowers.

539
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:23,932
Scott: You actually needed to put in it.

540
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:28,010
Scott: It was a really awesome nerdy vase Alright, so there's a big difference there already.

541
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:30,160
Rym: that's gonna highlight the point of this thing you care about.

542
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:37,520
Rym: I know if I own a vase I don't put it in my pocket and carry it with me literally every hour of every day.

543
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:44,841
Rym: I put it in one place out of reach of bunnies and dogs and children and I never touch it except to dust it once A week.

544
00:32:44,902 --> 00:32:48,980
Rym: the point is is that you don't blame your of a precarious shelf.

545
00:32:49,128 --> 00:33:01,560
Scott: Yeah When you are handling it this valuable item that you care about you have a valuable thing that you care about When you handle it regardless of how often that is you handle it with some measure of carefulness and respect.

546
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:04,009
Rym: But there is already a difference in that.

547
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,100
Rym: the kind of most I mean a lot of people I know don't care.

548
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:08,646
Rym: Take care of their shit and that's a whole.

549
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:10,373
Scott: they don't take care of the shit in general.

550
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:12,160
Rym: Yeah, like it all like their lives.

551
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:13,667
Rym: Yeah, like Rick the party.

552
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:14,813
Rym: You need to get your shit.

553
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:16,300
Rym: get it all together.

554
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:19,010
Rym: I don't care if you put it in a bag or a backpack.

555
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:21,620
Rym: just get it all and put it all in one place.

556
00:33:22,123 --> 00:33:23,150
Rym: See your shits together.

557
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:23,613
Rym: Mm-hmm.

558
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:39,960
Rym: But anyway Technology like smartphones you carry with you all the time you handle it like a hundred times more often than you handle it Still Extremely valuable it's you care about it a fuck ton and it worth hundreds of dollars probably.

559
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:46,880
Scott: So when you take it out of your pocket Don't just sort of like hold it between two fingers while you're holding an ice cream in the other hand.

560
00:33:47,302 --> 00:33:50,600
Scott: Right, don't sort of you know do anything dumb with it, right?

561
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,192
Scott: Hold it carefully hold it close to you If you're in a crowded place, you just hold it far away from you.

562
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:56,358
Scott: So I'm just walk up snatch it run.

563
00:33:56,981 --> 00:34:00,276
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know be careful be mindful of this like.

564
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:05,494
Scott: imagine you're holding Like if you have a brand new iPhone 6s, right that's like hundreds of dollars.

565
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:07,140
Scott: six to eight hundred dollars probably right?

566
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,618
Scott: Let's say it's the top-of-the-line one.

567
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:13,980
Scott: Would you just hold six hundred dollar bills just like out there sort of in between two fingers in one hand, right?

568
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,920
Rym: It's like what is wrong?

569
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:22,875
Scott: But at the same time that's what I want to do with right if your hands are all dirty You're like maybe covered in like butter grease because you ate a big pretzel or something.

570
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:23,879
Scott: That was all buttery.

571
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:26,639
Scott: Don't reach and touch your phone until you wash your hands.

572
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:28,380
Rym: I guess the difference is with the phone.

573
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:33,480
Rym: I pull it out a lot and poke at it a lot because I'm doing stuff with it actively all the time.

574
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:40,100
Rym: Yes, I do as well, but I'm not gonna stop poking at it because I'm I mean I'll pull out biking and like fucks around with it.

575
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,992
Scott: But now I won't do it like for example biking if I need to.

576
00:34:43,053 --> 00:34:49,114
Scott: if I my phone starts ringing while I'm biking I'll do a little pullover, you know stop and then take the phone out.

577
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,000
Rym: It depends already on where I am.

578
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:57,920
Scott: I don't have the phone in one hand Looking at it while I'm biking with like one hand on the handlebar paying attention to the phone.

579
00:34:58,683 --> 00:34:59,748
Scott: That does never happens.

580
00:34:59,788 --> 00:35:00,692
Scott: I've seen people do that.

581
00:35:00,913 --> 00:35:01,777
Scott: No, I do that.

582
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:03,200
Scott: Don't do that.

583
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:10,340
Rym: But I do that when I'm on like the super wide empty bike lane that's separated from the road over on the west side.

584
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:11,323
Rym: I don't do that.

585
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:14,455
Scott: I see people doing that going over the bridge like uphill dude.

586
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:15,197
Rym: I saw a guy.

587
00:35:15,217 --> 00:35:15,940
Rym: he was walking.

588
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,646
Rym: It wasn't even biking.

589
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:17,453
Rym: That was today.

590
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,424
Rym: on my way home I was standing in a light.

591
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:20,106
Rym: the light was red.

592
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:26,827
Rym: cars are just going by like you couldn't jaywalk like even though like Hardest core New Yorker would not jaywalk

593
00:35:26,947 --> 00:35:28,793
Scott: cuz it's green light for the cars and this

594
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:41,192
Rym: dude in hipster glasses young, dude Literally is on his phone talking and just walks into traffic and a car almost hits him lays on the horn Swerves out of the way and he doesn't even look up.

595
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:43,099
Rym: He just keeps walking and talking on his phone.

596
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:45,666
Rym: It was amazing shit.

597
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:48,919
Rym: and then no so there's a lot of crowd of people cuz you know rush hour.

598
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,642
Rym: She hit him.

599
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:58,712
Rym: so he gets to the sidewalk and there's a wall of people who are all staring at him And there's no way through and he literally shoves his way through the crowd of people Mumbling and goes on his way.

600
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:01,027
Scott: dude if he shoved me I would like that would have been it.

601
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:04,845
Scott: once someone shoves you that's like like license I used to kill.

602
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:08,879
Rym: thing is I ride the seven to work so I get shoved enough and my I also shove.

603
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:09,705
Rym: in return I give him.

604
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:13,430
Scott: I would give him a little leg sweep Like sweet, but who would?

605
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,317
Scott: he would know who did it.

606
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:17,087
Rym: so Here's the thing I've realized.

607
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:24,220
Rym: there's a fundamental thing with phones that are sort of different from all the other tech Is that it's a giant screen, but you also carry with you all the time.

608
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:25,443
Rym: So here's my rules.

609
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:26,064
Rym: number one.

610
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:28,109
Rym: You need to take a real hard.

611
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:30,375
Rym: Look at yourself and decide something.

612
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:32,460
Rym: Are you capable of?

613
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,519
Rym: Exhibiting basic amounts of dexterity and not dropping your phone all the time?

614
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,172
Rym: You need to honestly answer that question.

615
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:43,000
Rym: if the answer is no you are not capable.

616
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:49,040
Rym: Put your phone in one of those stupid heavy-ass cases that makes it twice as big and pay for Apple care.

617
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,873
Rym: Like don't pretend that you're not gonna break your phone.

618
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:54,280
Rym: you broke the last four.

619
00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:56,367
Rym: It's time to realize the thing is.

620
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:57,932
Scott: I see people getting cases.

621
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:00,140
Scott: It's like it's like no you shouldn't get a case.

622
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:02,819
Scott: You should change yourself and not be a clumsy oaf.

623
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,935
Rym: But the reality is there are people who cannot change themselves.

624
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,915
Scott: and my advice to you You don't deserve to have a phone if you're a clumsy oaf.

625
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:13,670
Rym: you shouldn't be carrying around $600 and there is a market for this.

626
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:14,995
Rym: you pay for Apple care.

627
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,420
Rym: They just don't care anymore.

628
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:17,627
Rym: Just drop your phone all the time.

629
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:19,337
Rym: You're just paying a lot more money than I am.

630
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:25,500
Scott: Yeah, that's bad, I mean if you saw someone being so wasteful like I don't give a shit.

631
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,307
Scott: I'll just break my car and buy a new one.

632
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:30,259
Scott: I'm so good so much monies then that's a bad person.

633
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:34,980
Rym: Yeah, what I find is that in general the people who who have I don't need to take care of my phone.

634
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,240
Scott: I'll just buy expensive case or buy a new phone and pay over Apple care.

635
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,233
Rym: Well the thing is I use my phone naked.

636
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:42,399
Rym: I decided a long time ago I want my phone to be small.

637
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,095
Scott: I got a case when I had the iPhone 3g originally cuz like.

638
00:37:46,316 --> 00:37:49,103
Scott: I didn't think about it And then after a while I just kept take.

639
00:37:49,123 --> 00:38:05,965
Scott: I took the case off and then I took the screen protector off and then I haven't put a protector on Since and the only time I had a problem was when my my phone was Assumedly safely like inside my bag and I fell off my bike like a dumbass not getting hit by anything Just falling like a stupid.

640
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:09,580
Scott: Yeah, the phone happened to be on the falling side.

641
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:15,721
Rym: I mean sometimes phones in a bag like sometimes phones just break like literally my old Nexus 4.

642
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:21,238
Scott: The screen shattered when nothing was happening there, you know, there's always an excusable situation for breaking right.

643
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:24,912
Scott: for example Maybe it exploded like there's a bad battery.

644
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:25,494
Scott: It happens.

645
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:26,498
Scott: It's happened more than once.

646
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,925
Scott: maybe It's just defective.

647
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:31,976
Scott: I mean I had the home button not working situation.

648
00:38:32,016 --> 00:38:33,240
Scott: I had to get a recall, right?

649
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,007
Scott: That wasn't my bad.

650
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,580
Scott: That was you know, it's a recalled device.

651
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,320
Rym: They made it wrong, but like my Nexus 5 has a crack in the bottom.

652
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,751
Rym: You know why cuz it wouldn't fit?

653
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:42,580
Rym: because it was too big and it wouldn't fit in the case.

654
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,920
Rym: I put my Nexus 4 in when I used to run and I was in Hong Kong and I wasn't gonna not run.

655
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:52,993
Rym: So I went running in the mountains just holding my phone in my hand And of course, I fucking like fell down the mountain broke the bottom of my.

656
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:54,660
Scott: there are other weird situations, too.

657
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:07,337
Scott: like your phone is safely on a table and You know, it's it's perfectly safe in a safe place someone else knocks an expensive vase over and it Somebody just spills a soda from like a ridiculously long distance away and it gets your phone wet.

658
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:08,100
Scott: and that's the end, right?

659
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,572
Scott: It's kind of stuff can happen and even you know It's okay if that kind of thing happens that it happens all the time.

660
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:15,074
Scott: It's life.

661
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:16,980
Scott: accidents are not completely avoidable.

662
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,100
Scott: However, there are many situations for which there is no excuse.

663
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:24,760
Scott: For example, your screen is scratched the fuck up because you put your phone in the same pocket with your keys.

664
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:26,788
Rym: I don't understand that.

665
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:30,000
Scott: that is just like my boss did that and he just got a new phone.

666
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:36,792
Scott: He's like, I'm not putting it in the pocket with the keys anymore Like I would never use one because I just think they're silly.

667
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:45,300
Rym: but I can understand the rationale of someone using one of those like Thick cases that protects their phone, but the people who put those little like thin screen protectors.

668
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:48,719
Scott: I did that originally and then I took that off because I was like, wow, this is dumb.

669
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:52,620
Rym: I mean it is real hard to scratch that glass already like you got to work at it.

670
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,700
Scott: I've had an iPhone 3g and iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 and I'm an iPhone 6 and all of those phones.

671
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:09,666
Scott: The only time any of them was ever in a case was the original iPhone 3g for a few months and the only one that ever broke was the iPhone 5 when I fell off my bike and I was able to get it repaired because all that really happened was like the.

672
00:40:10,587 --> 00:40:11,720
Scott: The screen wasn't even broken.

673
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,350
Scott: It was just like dented in the metal in the back and the van.

674
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,976
Scott: the cable connecting the screen to the you know board got Sort of pulled out.

675
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:24,021
Scott: So these are just reconnected it and put my phone back together and it was fine until the iPhone 6 came out and I replaced It.

676
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:30,180
Scott: so I've gone that long without ever and I know why you're conflating breaking and scratching.

677
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:33,534
Scott: I've dropped my phone many times.

678
00:40:33,594 --> 00:40:36,631
Scott: like you get out of bed in the morning You reach over and try to get off the nightstand.

679
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:37,879
Scott: He's not get onto the floor.

680
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,356
Scott: You're like that kind of shit happens and my phone is still in perfect condition.

681
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:44,419
Scott: despite that Part of what kind of drop do you need to have?

682
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,025
Rym: well part of a break like.

683
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:56,593
Rym: I saw some things where someone took a Nexus 5 and they showed like if you drop it and It lands on like certain spots the screen just shatters But at one degree angle different and it's totally fine.

684
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,183
Scott: They measured it with like a Caliper.

685
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:03,080
Rym: they know they were doing that Consumer Reports style like they shot it out of this little like slingshot gun.

686
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:03,584
Scott: How do they know?

687
00:41:03,624 --> 00:41:05,619
Scott: it wasn't just because that was the third or fourth drop?

688
00:41:06,301 --> 00:41:12,793
Rym: No, they used a bunch of different phones like they were doing stuff But the I don't know that one wasn't a defective one the scratch phone.

689
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:16,785
Rym: There is no excuse for scratching The screen on a phone.

690
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:22,680
Rym: it can't happen unless you turn it face down on the cement and move it around Just like take it to the beach just like roll it around.

691
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,067
Scott: Why did you take your phone to the beach?

692
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:25,836
Rym: I do in a ziploc bag.

693
00:41:25,876 --> 00:41:28,619
Scott: That's totally works I guess in a zip like bag, but you know what?

694
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,542
Scott: I don't know.

695
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:32,719
Scott: You're gonna leave your really expensive phone just sitting by the chair where you go in the water.

696
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:34,009
Rym: I'll pick it in the water with you.

697
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:36,623
Scott: Uh No, don't do that.

698
00:41:36,743 --> 00:41:41,777
Rym: The Nexus not the Nexus the Sony Xperia's 100% waterproof.

699
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,060
Scott: That's pretty good.

700
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:44,909
Rym: Yeah, like that's actually great.

701
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,758
Scott: Like you can just dunk it in an ocean.

702
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,788
Rym: Yeah 30 meters go.

703
00:41:50,122 --> 00:41:51,486
Rym: Well, so the warranty.

704
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:56,840
Rym: they say no salt water because you know reasons but the reality is it's totally fine.

705
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,434
Scott: Yeah, I when we actually went to the wedding.

706
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:08,418
Scott: I had my phone in my pocket I forgot it was there and I started to walk into the water and then I said, oh no But you know what.

707
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:16,806
Scott: I've gotten my phone like wet on occasions Like I've been out in the rain with the phone and I got a whole bunch of drops of rain on like crazy heavy Like a few months ago.

708
00:42:16,906 --> 00:42:21,100
Scott: never has it been wet enough to cause it to malfunction in any significant fashion whatsoever.

709
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:24,700
Scott: So a few months ago, you have to really get your phone about to make water hurt it.

710
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,880
Rym: I was feeling kind of shitty like like getting sick.

711
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:33,015
Rym: So I just took a long hot shower and while I was standing in there for like five minutes Just like I was holding my phone in my hand out of the water.

712
00:42:33,055 --> 00:42:35,366
Rym: Just like reading Fark Mm-hmm, and then I sneezed.

713
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:41,214
Rym: I just dropped my phone just right into the stream of water whoosh submerged And I went out and I picked it up and I wiped it off.

714
00:42:41,597 --> 00:42:41,999
Rym: totally fine.

715
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:44,912
Scott: So it's like to get to ruin your phone with water.

716
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:46,359
Scott: it's like whoa, what did you do?

717
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:49,093
Scott: Yeah, like did you just throw it in a swimming pool?

718
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:50,180
Scott: Did you just put it in the safe?

719
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,585
Rym: Well, I used to not understand the people who would drop their phones in the toilet But then I noticed something.

720
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:58,420
Rym: a lot of the old people I know they wear their smartphones and holsters on their belt.

721
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Rym: That's like blackberry style and it'll just pop out of those holsters.

722
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,360
Scott: Yeah, like boop the blackberry holster actually lets the blackberry know when it's in the holster that does with a magnet.

723
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:09,168
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so it's not just.

724
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:11,620
Scott: it's not just phones even though it's the most broken thing, right?

725
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,544
Scott: It's all kinds of stuff.

726
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:16,840
Scott: I see people laptops that are beat the fuck up and it's like what the hell?

727
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,280
Rym: No, if you have a Toughbook and that's the point like you take it to the beach.

728
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,002
Rym: Okay, cool.

729
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:24,133
Scott: But like I see like I have my all my laptops forever.

730
00:43:24,173 --> 00:43:26,360
Scott: The only damages have been done to them is stickers added.

731
00:43:26,842 --> 00:43:27,747
Scott: Yeah, they've not been.

732
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:36,553
Scott: the army keys popping off the keyboard I don't have any you know like the back of the Plastic chipping off like nothing has ever happened to it to break it in any way.

733
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:38,660
Scott: and all I can think is number one.

734
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:45,160
Scott: Most of the times I see this it's people with like really fragile a crappy laptops from like aces.

735
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,070
Rym: Yeah, those things like you like.

736
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,727
Rym: I've dropped my Lenovo laptops Significant distances and they've been fine.

737
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:56,860
Rym: I've seen aces that broke because you put them in your Timbuktu bag next to a single book.

738
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:05,833
Scott: Yeah, don't buy pieces of junk, but I've seen Mac books that are basically like steel Our aluminum I guess and people are denting the hell out of them.

739
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:07,459
Rym: and it's like what did you do?

740
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:09,954
Scott: You put it in a bag nicely, you know, you don't have to.

741
00:44:09,974 --> 00:44:11,000
Scott: you just toss it in the bag.

742
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,520
Scott: You don't have to like, you know, and then you know.

743
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,568
Rym: You do the same thing.

744
00:44:13,648 --> 00:44:14,313
Rym: tight phone.

745
00:44:14,353 --> 00:44:15,240
Scott: put it back in the bag.

746
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,200
Scott: They don't throw it in a lady slamming it down in the table.

747
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:20,935
Rym: I've seen this piece the same thing below the phones.

748
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:26,420
Rym: when they scratch them up They don't put the laptop in a case or something and slide it into their bag.

749
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:36,188
Rym: They toss it into a big open backpack next to a whole bunch of stuff like their phone and they're all banging into each other so To turn the show away from.

750
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:37,915
Rym: we're just superior to you.

751
00:44:37,935 --> 00:44:39,180
Rym: and an actual advice.

752
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,555
Rym: But we are here are rims rules of not breaking your phone.

753
00:44:43,575 --> 00:44:44,860
Rym: one get a smart watch.

754
00:44:45,022 --> 00:44:46,398
Rym: You don't take it out of your pocket all the time.

755
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:56,955
Scott: That's a smartwatch does prevent reduce the amount of number of times you take the phone out of the pocket which thus Reduces the number of opportunities you have or breaking the phone by taking it out to.

756
00:44:57,416 --> 00:45:00,897
Rym: if you're taking out of your pocket Hold on to it before you take it out.

757
00:45:01,881 --> 00:45:05,960
Rym: Most people who like I see people drop their phones literally every day and all that happens.

758
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:11,780
Rym: They put their hand in their pocket They pull it out and then they immediately drop it as soon as it comes to their hand comes out of their pocket.

759
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:13,389
Rym: I don't know how that happens.

760
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:14,053
Rym: Just don't do that.

761
00:45:14,576 --> 00:45:19,960
Scott: That's my advice Don't touch your phone if there's anything wrong with your hands, right?

762
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,420
Scott: Like if you just worth having a snow fight or if you just were covered in sand.

763
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,283
Rym: You're just eating.

764
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:30,160
Scott: if you're just needing some dough in the kitchen or you know any kind of thing on your hands.

765
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:33,218
Scott: Maybe you're like, you know rubbing some butter on them for some fun time.

766
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:35,587
Scott: Whipped cream action, right.

767
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,126
Scott: if your hands are messed up in any way Don't touch the phone.

768
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:43,820
Scott: wash them and get them nice and okay before you touch the phone.

769
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:50,768
Rym: Never put the phone in any compartment with anything else ever Mm-hmm, unless it's like paper.

770
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:56,654
Rym: Yeah, they even that like don't like I. Why do people put their phone in the same pockets their keys?

771
00:45:56,695 --> 00:45:56,815
Rym: Like.

772
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:57,800
Rym: are you a moron?

773
00:45:58,542 --> 00:46:00,134
Rym: You've got more than one pocket, what's it?

774
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:00,899
Rym: all those other pockets?

775
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:02,463
Scott: It's like I put my.

776
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:06,015
Rym: I've got at least three or four pockets on every pair of pants.

777
00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:10,434
Rym: I own up But don't put your phone in your back pocket.

778
00:46:10,474 --> 00:46:11,580
Scott: You're gonna sit on it.

779
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,989
Scott: Yeah, I don't put anything in my any back pocket ever.

780
00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:15,033
Rym: I put my wallet back there.

781
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:15,775
Scott: I do not.

782
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:17,040
Scott: that causes weird sitting.

783
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:19,153
Scott: No, it doesn't even with a tiny wallet.

784
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,400
Scott: It causes a weird sitting one.

785
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:27,488
Scott: My wall is tiny and even if it doesn't cause weird sitting you don't have this thing shoved in Squeezing into your bow to buy nice pants.

786
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:32,669
Rym: The back pocket is shifted a little bit away from the pelvic bone and up So you're not actually sitting on it.

787
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,300
Rym: It's like to the side of the butt when you sit down.

788
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,800
Scott: So now if someone walks by they just take your wallet right now cuz they're fucking tight pants.

789
00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:40,819
Rym: I didn't buy you to get your hand into my pants and get that.

790
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:49,802
Scott: That's going in the thread Plus.

791
00:46:49,862 --> 00:47:00,430
Rym: honestly if I'm in a place where Pickpocketing is a real possibility, which is not common anymore in most places I shift it to the front pocket while I'm standing there.

792
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:02,459
Scott: everything I have is always in the front pocket always.

793
00:47:03,142 --> 00:47:03,985
Scott: Why why not?

794
00:47:04,065 --> 00:47:05,310
Rym: front left pocket keys.

795
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,634
Scott: front left pocket phone.

796
00:47:06,695 --> 00:47:08,240
Scott: front right pocket wall.

797
00:47:09,424 --> 00:47:11,940
Rym: back left pocket nothing.

798
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:14,144
Rym: Back right pocket nothing.

799
00:47:14,646 --> 00:47:16,751
Rym: if I have a piece of paper like a boarding.

800
00:47:16,892 --> 00:47:17,213
Scott: Oh, yeah.

801
00:47:17,253 --> 00:47:17,433
Scott: Yeah.

802
00:47:17,453 --> 00:47:17,594
Scott: Sure.

803
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:18,236
Scott: Maybe yeah.

804
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:31,360
Rym: extra thing goes that maybe Occasionally, I'll shift the phone to the back pocket while I'm walking upstairs because phones are too big and I can't bend my leg that Much if with tight jeans, but it goes back into the front pocket immediately afterwards.

805
00:47:31,501 --> 00:47:36,407
Scott: My keys I say a front right pocket wallet front left pocket phone keys Go into a different place.

806
00:47:36,428 --> 00:47:38,460
Scott: Like if I have my messenger bag my keys are on the low.

807
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,665
Rym: Yeah, the dog did they?

808
00:47:39,685 --> 00:47:40,327
Rym: we meet right?

809
00:47:40,347 --> 00:47:41,331
Rym: He's go somewhere else if you got a.

810
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:43,540
Scott: but maybe I'm going somewhere wearing a coat.

811
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:47,100
Scott: I'll put the keys in the coat pocket or maybe I'm going somewhere on a bike.

812
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:48,720
Scott: Little thing on the bike Jersey.

813
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,553
Scott: It's like the keys always go in the extra place And if I have to I can stick them in with the wallet in the right pocket.

814
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:56,240
Rym: the phone goes by itself no matter what?

815
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,288
Rym: And you never put it in the back pocket and then sit on it.

816
00:47:58,409 --> 00:47:59,493
Rym: Yes, like just don't do that.

817
00:47:59,574 --> 00:47:59,795
Scott: Don't?

818
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:09,080
Scott: uh There's really no other rules like don't Be forceful with stuff treat it like that's a vase and be careful.

819
00:48:09,902 --> 00:48:11,976
Rym: I mean, I see people holding their phones with death.

820
00:48:12,037 --> 00:48:16,514
Scott: imagine I look at whatever device you have near you whatever kind of thing you have that you care about.

821
00:48:16,554 --> 00:48:27,139
Scott: maybe your watch your phone You know your laptop, maybe your TV in your house, or you know any kind of electronic gadget you care about your camera Right with your expensive lenses on it, right?

822
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,886
Scott: Imagine right now you close your eyes.

823
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:33,738
Scott: imagine that thing like breaking like like so broken.

824
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:36,025
Scott: that is beyond repair Like got hit with a sledgehammer.

825
00:48:36,285 --> 00:48:38,252
Scott: It's broken super broken now.

826
00:48:38,312 --> 00:48:40,940
Scott: Imagine how upset you are that this thing is broken.

827
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:41,863
Scott: How upset are you?

828
00:48:42,445 --> 00:48:46,460
Scott: Okay, if you want to avoid being that upset be fucking careful.

829
00:48:47,721 --> 00:48:53,156
Rym: Of course, there's also another split here between devices that require maintenance and devices that do not.

830
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:56,288
Rym: there's no maintenance to do on your phone It's just a phone that's true.

831
00:48:56,409 --> 00:49:04,037
Rym: But like my computer the other day I went to render GeekNights and it took way longer than usual took 10 minutes to render out the episode.

832
00:49:04,097 --> 00:49:05,060
Rym: I was like, what?

833
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,143
Rym: What?

834
00:49:07,582 --> 00:49:11,096
Rym: So I look and my processor was clocking it like 1.6 gigahertz.

835
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:17,176
Rym: Okay, that's a full gigahertz left less than what it is supposed to be running at.

836
00:49:17,196 --> 00:49:17,998
Rym: Hmm.

837
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:22,070
Rym: So think then My computer just needs to be cleaned out.

838
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,559
Rym: One of the fans is not spending that.

839
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:24,988
Rym: well I just don't have efficient.

840
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,537
Rym: It's time to clean my computer.

841
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:34,578
Rym: Most people I know Not clean yeah, not gonna name any names but certain people who live in Pennsylvania that I know.

842
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:44,734
Rym: Your computers inside of them have entire civilizations brought from the dust of eras long past mites The might kingdom mighty Kingdom.

843
00:49:45,137 --> 00:49:52,620
Rym: Yes So dude, if you have an electronic device Learn if it requires maintenance or not.

844
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,558
Scott: And this applies to even things that you like wouldn't think about like I have a Clippers to shave my head.

845
00:49:57,658 --> 00:50:05,580
Scott: the same one Barbara has that little book that came with it probably said like put oil in this spot You gotta grease that shit up once in a while according to the instructions, right?

846
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,829
Scott: I mean like almost the digital camera.

847
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,560
Scott: the sensor like got to be clean once in a while if anything got in there.

848
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:14,370
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know lenses.

849
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:15,980
Scott: You got to clean them at least a little bit.

850
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,085
Scott: You know the cleaning that much right?

851
00:50:17,105 --> 00:50:20,040
Scott: But yeah, but you know, they almost everything that you have.

852
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:23,474
Scott: I mean I had cast iron pot that came with maintenance instructions.

853
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:24,739
Scott: follow those.

854
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:27,331
Rym: Yeah, but like phones don't like.

855
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:29,060
Rym: there's nothing to do except my old palm free.

856
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:37,633
Rym: I actually needed to be taken apart and dusted regularly because of poor design Like I opened it one day and it was full of dust like a computer.

857
00:50:37,653 --> 00:50:39,879
Scott: I I was getting yourself a can of air.

858
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,139
Rym: Yep, I was dumbstruck by that.

859
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:48,073
Rym: I'm Seriously though most of you can't take our advice.

860
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:57,009
Rym: and if you're gonna keep breaking your stuff My advice to you is if the stuff that you keep breaking matters to you pay for the Apple care equivalent How many like 3ds is you see?

861
00:50:57,029 --> 00:50:58,820
Scott: you like snap screens and shit?

862
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:01,989
Rym: Yeah, my 3ds lasted for a long time.

863
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:03,876
Rym: But finally the screen.

864
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:04,840
Scott: you broke it on purpose.

865
00:51:05,483 --> 00:51:07,010
Rym: No, I'm not gonna replace it.

866
00:51:07,794 --> 00:51:09,120
Scott: Oh you even broke another one.

867
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,543
Scott: You're the fear that clumsy?

868
00:51:11,643 --> 00:51:12,907
Scott: Oh breaking new 3ds.

869
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:14,471
Rym: I've never broken a 3d.

870
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:17,580
Rym: I've never broken my my original fat DS.

871
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:21,326
Scott: I've never broken any Nintendo portable gaming platform.

872
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:22,669
Rym: my original fat DS broke.

873
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:29,039
Rym: my old regular DS made it until like about a year ago And it still mostly works fine.

874
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:35,608
Rym: But like one corner of the screen goes all flickery weirdly and I think like the LED is dying there like something weird is happening to it.

875
00:51:36,943 --> 00:51:44,000
Rym: Not that I really need it anymore because I got my 3ds Which is fine working like a champ and I don't really use it because I've played every game I care about on it.

876
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,528
Rym: There aren't new games that matter.

877
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,680
Scott: Why don't they make Mario maker for assholes?

878
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:49,020
Rym: That would be great.

879
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:55,084
Rym: There's rumors of the next console being good, but I'm probably gonna get it if it's Wii U compared I might also get it.

880
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:55,525
Rym: It's looking.

881
00:51:55,766 --> 00:51:59,020
Rym: that might be that that might be the return to the console lands vermin Scott.

882
00:51:59,422 --> 00:52:00,809
Scott: No, I'll just play the few games on it.

883
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,740
Scott: Like I did with every Nintendo console and be done with you.

884
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,014
Rym: No, you return to the console and like on a vacation.

885
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:05,980
Rym: You're not gonna live there.

886
00:52:06,905 --> 00:52:07,919
Rym: You live in PC land.

887
00:52:10,584 --> 00:52:11,476
Rym: But stop breaking your shit.

888
00:52:17,604 --> 00:52:20,140
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

889
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,020
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

890
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:30,260
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

891
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:37,700
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

892
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,476
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

893
00:52:42,721 --> 00:53:18,044
Rym: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night and so the Odyssey into dumb things that I can think of putting at the end of episodes continues as Per our new patreon reward tiers quote.
