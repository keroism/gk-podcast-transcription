1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,787
Rym: It's Monday September 17th.

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:12,730
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:16,000
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:18,659
Rym: We talk about the business technology disconnect.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,378
Rym: Sam preenie Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:29,899
Rym: It's coming.

7
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:31,649
Rym: I don't know if I can contain myself.

8
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:38,352
Scott: Our listener should be glad it did not come or else this podcast might not exist in its current Might.

9
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:39,577
Rym: not probably wouldn't.

10
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:44,570
Scott: yeah, well we did go to work today wisely Very wise yes.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:59,313
Rym: I'm very glad that I did not skip work today in order to play a certain game a game that possibly I have been waiting for for a decade different a I mean if you waited for anything longer in your entire life You know what.

12
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:02,162
Rym: no no nothing in my life.

13
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:03,928
Rym: Have I waited this long for?

14
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:06,100
Rym: because Duke Nukem I wasn't actually waiting for.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,489
Rym: I never believed that game would come out.

16
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:11,299
Rym: But this I mean I saw the videos.

17
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,670
Rym: it was like this game is coming out soon, and that was like eight years ago.

18
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:19,240
Scott: Yep, but anyway the point is is that we were thinking about.

19
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:26,490
Scott: they said the beta version of the game would come out today and because We pre-ordered we would get into that beta with you know just automatically.

20
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:35,621
Scott: but They didn't say what time would be coming out and a bunch of people were like oh, it'll come out at midnight You know wherever time zone they happen to live in.

21
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:50,150
Scott: and smarter people said no It'll come out midnight valve time so 3 a.m.. Eastern time, and then people said oh No, it'll come out later in the day because you know they got to work on it and stuff And there's also the chance that it won't come out.

22
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,333
Rym: But that arguments silly.

23
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:57,430
Rym: if they give a date and then they need the extra eight hours to do something to it something's wrong.

24
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:00,228
Scott: yeah, well currently it is a what like.

25
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:03,801
Rym: It is currently 7 45 p.m.. Eastern Standard Time.

26
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:16,285
Scott: Early tonight if it's 7 45 here, then it's six five a quarter to five In valve headquarters, so they got some time before they push the button.

27
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:18,070
Rym: Yeah, we'll see what happens.

28
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:18,793
Scott: I'll see.

29
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:22,690
Scott: I guarantee they'll push the button before midnight Pacific time.

30
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,441
Rym: I only give it a 60% chance of it coming out today.

31
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:26,124
Scott: I give it a 90%.

32
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:37,004
Scott: well Considering the track record of Team Fortress 2 there is a chance that it will come out though and there'll be a problem which is not included in my 90% estimate.

33
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:41,881
Scott: for example it could come out and All the servers will be full of people and no one can play.

34
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:43,950
Scott: it could come out and the server won't work.

35
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:44,678
Scott: It could come out.

36
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:45,770
Scott: no one will have servers set up.

37
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,039
Scott: It could come out and it doesn't work period.

38
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:51,231
Scott: it could come out and it only works on some systems because the beta and it's Buggy.

39
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:53,905
Scott: there's all sorts of scenarios, but could come out.

40
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:54,829
Rym: and then the low.

41
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:55,755
Rym: well You know what I'll bet.

42
00:02:55,775 --> 00:03:00,273
Rym: even right now the load of kids sitting there Reloading steam Constantly.

43
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,341
Scott: it could be quite a load.

44
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,566
Scott: it could be quite a load.

45
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,132
Scott: and that brings me to the point I want to make.

46
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:08,546
Scott: if you're one of those people who when something's gonna happen on the internet.

47
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:09,550
Scott: Let's say I don't know.

48
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:19,675
Scott: Engadget is live blocking blogging an Apple press conference or game is about to come out or You know any sort of.

49
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:21,362
Scott: there is something impending.

50
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:29,558
Scott: you know like there's something about to happen There is news coming out about it or something is going to happen sometime But you're not sure exactly what time.

51
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:33,133
Rym: yep like sometime tonight Nintendo will announce their new game Semprene.

52
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:39,287
Scott: right if you're sitting there reloading the video game website constantly You're wasting your time.

53
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:41,009
Scott: Well, you shouldn't do that.

54
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:49,255
Rym: There's always gonna be the tier zero person the person who is the first one to see the updated Business business.

55
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:53,550
Scott: that's a person is mo and business know who that person is the blogger who's paid to do it.

56
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,137
Scott: That's what that person is.

57
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:55,318
Scott: well.

58
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,550
Rym: No it's always some punk kid, but it doesn't matter.

59
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:02,692
Scott: There's punk kids who do it too, but for example you don't have to stay up Reading.

60
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,921
Scott: you know the Engadget whatever.

61
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:08,429
Scott: as they update it live blogging Which I think is pretty stupid.

62
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:12,775
Scott: When you could just wait until they're done and then read the whole thing at once Why waste you?

63
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,470
Scott: think about how much longer and how much more time you're wasting?

64
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,345
Scott: Reloading it constantly?

65
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:20,300
Scott: yeah I mean one sentence at a time and half the time you reload.

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,413
Scott: there isn't even a new sentence for Team Fortress 2.

67
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:27,050
Rym: In the time you spend reloading you could just be playing some other game and practicing.

68
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,957
Scott: Yeah, I know think about all today.

69
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:38,110
Scott: if you would have sat there trying to get Team Fortress 2 all day You would have been reloading for over 12 hours Constantly and you would have never gotten anything for your efforts.

70
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:39,133
Rym: I mean you don't.

71
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:40,458
Rym: there's the tier zero person.

72
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:47,048
Rym: you know the person who actually sees the thing and the tier one person is like The blogger who finds out about it, and then it's all over the internet from that.

73
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:50,919
Scott: yeah If you're just browsing the web or doing your thing.

74
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:53,546
Scott: you know you sit around waiting doing something else.

75
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:57,061
Scott: when it happens You'll find out within minutes.

76
00:04:57,282 --> 00:04:58,970
Scott: You're not gonna find out within a second.

77
00:04:59,031 --> 00:04:59,950
Scott: You'll find out within minutes.

78
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,017
Scott: And you know what in the grand scheme?

79
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:04,144
Scott: think about this and those minutes.

80
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,150
Scott: you didn't get to play the game the first five minutes.

81
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:06,613
Scott: It was out.

82
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,688
Scott: you played it ten minutes after it was out.

83
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:12,746
Scott: well Would you rather play the game ten minutes after it comes out or?

84
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,137
Scott: Are you willing to save the get the?

85
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:20,010
Scott: you're basically in order to get those ten minutes of game time into your life?

86
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:24,665
Scott: You're gonna have to spend like 12 hours not doing anything else.

87
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:27,881
Rym: see the thing is it's a hindsight problem and that you can't really know.

88
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:34,989
Rym: like let's say I Would have done the effort if I'd known to get an extra ten minutes or day or whatever out of tribes, too.

89
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:38,190
Rym: Yeah, because that game there was a limited amount of time.

90
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:39,248
Rym: I could have played that game.

91
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:46,540
Rym: I guess it saddens me that there was time in my life when that game was playable And I was not playing it.

92
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,230
Rym: mm-hmm that is still.

93
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:50,590
Rym: I mean my my brain is kind of a loop.

94
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:59,585
Rym: you know what I was like rims gonna play an FPS and it goes through this constant loop of what I'm gonna play and It always starts at can you play tribes - and the answer is no.

95
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:00,830
Rym: and then I move on to another game.

96
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:09,122
Scott: Even if I could play tribes - there was just something about like the first few weeks when the game was brand new and the servers Were loaded with a bajillion people, and it was awesome.

97
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,850
Rym: We walked around RIT Constantly.

98
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:15,574
Scott: Alright, we're done with that.

99
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:19,510
Rym: Yes suffice to say we might suddenly stop doing this episode.

100
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:21,777
Scott: The message here because it's tech day.

101
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:25,510
Scott: the message for tech day is don't be a stupid asshole reloading constantly.

102
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:28,045
Scott: Just wait do something else.

103
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:30,737
Scott: with your time You're not missing anything.

104
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:31,680
Rym: in the very least.

105
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,330
Rym: if you're gonna be reloading have a Gameboy open.

106
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:37,782
Rym: Yeah, just set an auto-reloader World of Warcraft.

107
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:38,284
Rym: You know what?

108
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:41,796
Rym: have the auto-reloader and Play World of Warcraft.

109
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:44,530
Rym: Yeah, then and play a Gameboy game.

110
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,335
Scott: I'll even tell.

111
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,970
Scott: even go so far as to say reloading World of Warcraft.

112
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:53,446
Scott: Playing World of Warcraft is better than reloading something to see you can do them all at the same time.

113
00:06:53,567 --> 00:07:03,323
Rym: right now in my life I could be reloading steam playing World of Warcraft Playing Final Fantasy Tactics or Pokemon on my Gameboy and watching an anime.

114
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:04,446
Scott: I guess so.

115
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,519
Scott: Yeah, you got a multitask Yeah, but reloading is stupid a waste of time.

116
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,270
Rym: All right, so tech day news.

117
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,970
Rym: We're not gonna cop out with some lame-o tech news roundup, even though I think our last tech news roundup was justified.

118
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:17,935
Rym: Well, I think it was.

119
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:20,165
Rym: the problem is there's still like five or six newses.

120
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:21,190
Rym: I really want to talk about.

121
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:22,680
Scott: I will talk about one of them.

122
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,029
Rym: I am gonna talk about one of them.

123
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:38,490
Rym: So I'm sure you're all aware that some news came out not too long ago that the new iPods had a problem Where due to something and this was attributed to such things as evil Apple or some conspiracy or whatever.

124
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:39,186
Rym: But I'll get to that.

125
00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:45,227
Rym: You could no longer use anything but iTunes to update music on your iPod all the new iPods at least.

126
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:48,717
Rym: Uh-huh, and There was a rabble on the internet.

127
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:50,323
Rym: Oh shit those fuckers.

128
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:50,905
Rym: It's all.

129
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:51,748
Rym: it's all over now.

130
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:52,290
Rym: It's ruined.

131
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:57,263
Rym: Well, uh, it's been 36 hours since that was announced and it's been fixed.

132
00:07:57,464 --> 00:07:58,206
Rym: It's been cracked.

133
00:07:58,607 --> 00:07:59,830
Rym: It now works in Linux again.

134
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:01,917
Rym: I imagine everything's gonna be patched shortly.

135
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:11,510
Scott: Let me let me discuss the technology of what was going on here for a second Unlike other mp3 players like say for instance a Sansa or a kawan?

136
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:16,930
Scott: The iPod has an iPod and an iTunes database on it, right?

137
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:26,070
Scott: So like a Sansa if you have a Sansa you just put mp3s on it and the Sansa looks at its own File system sort of like when you're on your computer just browsing around folders.

138
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:32,655
Scott: It browses around its own folders looking for mp3s and whatever it can find and it puts them there for you to play It.

139
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:33,610
Scott: just it just finds them.

140
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,988
Scott: So all you have to do is put files on your Sansa and you're good to go.

141
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:42,289
Scott: The iPod unlike other players doesn't look to see what files it has.

142
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:49,630
Scott: It looks just in this database file that it has and that database file tells it what files are available for playing.

143
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:55,436
Scott: That's why if you just use your iPod like a hard drive and put some files on there You can't actually play them.

144
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:59,150
Scott: You need to use iTunes or something to add the files to your iPod.

145
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:04,992
Rym: It's now there's a lot of rationale and reasons and speculation as to why exactly Apple does Number one.

146
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:19,270
Rym: real truth is that because of the DRM in iTunes and the fact that they want you to be able to play music That is DRM on your iPod There is a vested interest in them having some measure of control over what goes on and does not go on the iPod.

147
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:24,190
Scott: Actually that has nothing as absolutely surprisingly the DRM has nothing to do with.

148
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:26,170
Rym: What's the rationale?

149
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:33,190
Scott: reason they have the iTunes database is because they are able to store arbitrary metadata about the files that you have on your iPod.

150
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,354
Scott: That's how that feature.

151
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:53,410
Scott: where you listen to a podcast you pause you sync, you know, you play again on your iTunes You sync you go to your iPod you pick up where you left off all those sorts of features that they have on there Were and the album, you know The the crazy advanced album art they have and other stuff works because they have a database that allows them to store metadata.

152
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,290
Scott: That's what allows you to do like the on-the-fly playlists are and then sync them up to your iTunes, huh?

153
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:07,703
Rym: So what you're telling me is that all the crazy conspiracy wackos on the internet who tell me that no It's all because Apple is evil and DRM and blah blah blah blah.

154
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:09,690
Rym: I might not be accurate.

155
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:19,810
Scott: I can tell you that the it is sucky that the iPod does use a database file to allow you to play files on the iPod in terms of not wanting to use iTunes.

156
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:25,850
Scott: However, the only reason that it would not gain them any advantage in terms of digital rights management.

157
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:42,290
Scott: The only advantages it would gain them are in terms of adding features to the iPod that I must regretfully admit other players do not have these features and One of the only ways to get those features would be to implement an equivalent sort of database thing.

158
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:47,150
Rym: Now the news was that in the new updates and everything what they did is they had a hash.

159
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:50,490
Rym: But it wasn't like hashes per files was a hash of the whole database.

160
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:57,836
Rym: So basically if you modified anything in the database at all, you know put an mp3 file in there or whatever The hash wouldn't match.

161
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:00,930
Rym: So your iPod would just say oh, I guess I don't have any music.

162
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,470
Scott: I'm not sure exactly if it was a hash of the database, but it was a hash nonetheless.

163
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:10,110
Scott: And if you wanted to you know, we know how the iTunes database is structured and they keep changing it.

164
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,896
Scott: But it's pretty easy to figure out how it.

165
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:15,550
Scott: you know, it works and that's why you can use other programs besides iTunes.

166
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,349
Scott: You can use Winamp or GTK pod or Amarok to manage the files on your iPod and have it work.

167
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:22,579
Scott: But they added a hash.

168
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:24,630
Scott: now a hash is a one-way math.

169
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:34,863
Scott: So they create a number based on something and they put that number there and then they can use that number To figure out whether your iTunes database is good or bad.

170
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:35,245
Rym: think of it.

171
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:36,630
Rym: It's like a. it's like a checksum.

172
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:37,661
Rym: It's a thing where you can.

173
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:51,101
Rym: yeah yeah, you can calculate this number based on known math from a set of data and If you know the number then you can test any set of data and find out with reasonable Certainty if it's this exact same set of data.

174
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:52,930
Scott: So this made it very difficult.

175
00:11:53,151 --> 00:12:00,070
Scott: You couldn't modify the iTunes database and still have it match the number and you couldn't reverse the number because it's one-way math.

176
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,349
Scott: It's not like, you know, you know, you could.

177
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:08,410
Scott: If I do 1 plus 1 is 2. right now I give you the number 2. tell me what math I did to come up with the number.

178
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,491
Rym: It might have been 1 point 5 plus point 5.

179
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:14,530
Scott: You don't know and you need to know those original numbers to get it to work.

180
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:23,290
Rym: So now of course one-way math is not absolutely one-way because you can reverse engineer things often times Yes, but that's for other reasons other than the math itself.

181
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:31,912
Scott: Well, yeah But the point is is that because of this one-way math you couldn't modify the iTunes database and have it work anymore in the new iPods.

182
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:36,324
Scott: Well, someone just figured it out and you can use non iTunes again.

183
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:41,242
Scott: Now people are saying oh, it's because Apple doesn't want anyone using non iTunes.

184
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,670
Rym: and that may well be yes.

185
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:51,174
Rym: Because well Apple has fussed with the way iTunes sharing and things work in the past and those fucks things have just happened to break A lot of third-party support.

186
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:56,149
Rym: Yeah granted third-party Linux II type just fix it almost right away every time that may be.

187
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:08,562
Scott: However, I do want to say that this sort of hashing feature in the iTunes database could have potentially other Uses than preventing you from using something besides iTunes.

188
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:11,130
Scott: It could support other advanced features.

189
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:20,970
Scott: I didn't actually look into great detail to figure out if there are doing anything with it But there are reasons to do it other than Preventing people from using non iTunes with their eye.

190
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:33,727
Rym: Well from what I've read and these are mostly comments on slashdot and tech blogs But a lot of these people seem to have done some research It looks like it's a hash of either the database or all the data on the iPod or some large large chunk.

191
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:44,410
Rym: Mm-hmm and It's the only possible use anyone could think of for it Is that you could tell if the database were corrupted and flag it as corrupt very quickly.

192
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:45,814
Scott: Oh, that is true.

193
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:48,020
Rym: And however, they could do that.

194
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,710
Rym: Anyway, and the performance gained by doing it this way is pretty negligible.

195
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,964
Scott: Yeah, well who knows why they decided to do it.

196
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:59,059
Scott: We'd have to ask Apple programmers You don't want to talk about anything and not allowed to legally.

197
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,483
Scott: so, you know, whatever you want to think, you know Cuz we have no evidence.

198
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:08,670
Scott: either way You have no evidence about anything when it comes to Apple and their internal doings or how any of their stuff works.

199
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:12,083
Scott: So you can just think whatever you want and we'll just this.

200
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,147
Scott: that's what the information is.

201
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:13,870
Scott: That's all I can say.

202
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:16,516
Scott: alright, so tour.

203
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:26,610
Scott: I think someone yelled at us for not mentioning tour specifically during our Anonymity episode even though I basically said everything there was to say about tour other than the word tour.

204
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,702
Rym: Tor is basically a system.

205
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:41,790
Rym: We're not gonna talk about the tech at all but it's a system whereby you can connect to this network and Have traffic routed through it such that you can effectively be absolutely anonymous.

206
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:49,261
Scott: Right, so there's a. there'd be a server out there with an IP address and Every like a million people are using that server.

207
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:51,810
Scott: and now all every you visit a website.

208
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,363
Scott: They think that server visited the website you visit.

209
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,790
Scott: you download some prong.

210
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,280
Scott: They think that server downloaded the.

211
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,490
Rym: it's a little more complicated than that And there's a lot like there's hopping around and we're not gonna get into all that.

212
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:14,368
Rym: but it's a system whereby as long as you buy into the system and you can bet and the system is Trustworthy and the people running it are trustworthy and tour Technologically seems to be fairly trustworthy is the side effect of that is it's oftentimes slow.

213
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:20,104
Scott: Yep The thing with happened here is some guy in Germany was running a tour server.

214
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,607
Scott: this server, of course Was had a lot of people using it.

215
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:35,690
Scott: So basically you have a computer and as far as the internet is concerned There's like a million people's worth of internet traffic all coming from this one IP address.

216
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:43,707
Scott: You know this IP address is visiting like a thousand websites simultaneously and it's downloading a hundred mp3 simultaneously and god knows what.

217
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,659
Scott: in Germany many things are illegal.

218
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:52,435
Scott: That should not be because Germans hate freedom and Someone in Germany.

219
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:54,482
Scott: Well this I agree should be illegal.

220
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,570
Scott: They posted a bomb threat on something.

221
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,438
Scott: All right, it should be illegal.

222
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,583
Scott: You shouldn't be allowed to post bombs.

223
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:09,519
Scott: Well, you know what it already is illegal I know so but that's fine, but they do hate freedom in Germany that regardless and They traced that back to the tour server.

224
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:17,262
Scott: And of course someone who posted the bomb threat was smart I guess from a technology standpoint and used tour so that they couldn't be traced.

225
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,172
Scott: and I bet they probably still don't know who posted The bomb.

226
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:23,190
Rym: and you know what they're never gonna know because tour is pretty good.

227
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,682
Scott: Yep, the guy who's running the tour server was arrested.

228
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,290
Rym: now this bothers me.

229
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:48,323
Rym: I mean, it's a tricky issue because on one hand you could I mean I think anyone can see the value of a of a trustworthy law enforcement Agency being able to track down the source of any communication, especially in the case of a threat or something like that or something Actually clearly illegal where no one would object to it.

230
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:53,010
Rym: Mm-hmm, but at the same time Why don't citizens have a right to?

231
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,637
Rym: Facilitate other people being anonymous.

232
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:58,590
Rym: I mean, I don't want to be hyperbolic here.

233
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:11,627
Rym: Making it illegal to run a tour server or arresting someone who runs the tour server is not much different than arresting people who sell Masks or arresting someone who agrees that any mail they get they'll just mail to someone else.

234
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,242
Scott: Yes I must say there is definitely a problem and I think you know some.

235
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:21,579
Scott: I'll tell you what side of this I'm on is in That rat people outlaw things that are wrong.

236
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:29,125
Rym: Like we're outlawing murder or outlawing robbery Outlawing stabbing right even if you're a libertarian I think you can agree that.

237
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:30,670
Rym: yes, I think it's a society.

238
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:33,370
Rym: We're not gonna let people murder lying child for yes.

239
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:37,927
Scott: But then people want to outlaw the tools that are used to.

240
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:40,295
Scott: you know Commit these crimes.

241
00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:49,447
Scott: and you know in some cases such as the kitchen knife where a device, you know Is used by so many people that they're unwilling to give it up and such it'll cause a problem.

242
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,175
Scott: if they outlaw it They don't outlaw it.

243
00:17:51,698 --> 00:18:05,850
Rym: but on the other hand some devices, you know if they're or items physical goods if they are less popular say lock picks or There's a lot of a lot of states in the US at least restrict the ownership of certain kinds of lock picks.

244
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,302
Rym: Yeah, even though I can make those lock picks.

245
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:21,224
Scott: I know and they outlaw Items that could potentially be used for crimes even if they have also non criminal uses that are useful I mean if there was an item that had no non criminal uses.

246
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:29,950
Scott: such says, I don't know You know what a bank robbing machine I think I could deal with outlawing the bank robbing machine that had no other use.

247
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:37,150
Rym: What if someone planted a bomb in the money bags in a bank and the bank robbing machine could then be used to safely get?

248
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,603
Rym: All the money with the bomb.

249
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:45,759
Scott: I'm saying Hypothetically if the bank robbing machine had no other uses like in that situation It would just get the money and leave with and leaving the.

250
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:48,110
Rym: let's go one step further and go to the opposite.

251
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:55,950
Rym: There is nothing in this studio right here right now Anywhere we can reach or see that could not be used to commit a crime.

252
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:59,727
Scott: I guess you could use just about anything in some way to help.

253
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:00,410
Scott: you can make a crime.

254
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:07,150
Rym: I could hit you over the head with the Marantz I could infringe on copyrights with my computer.

255
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:18,310
Scott: Yes, and I really do not think that it should be illegal to sell or make Almost anything or use almost anything in a non-criminal way.

256
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,090
Scott: I mean, I guess maybe poison gas you probably shouldn't have in your house.

257
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,870
Rym: Well, yeah when it comes to physical things like weapons that I think there are a lot more justifiable reasons.

258
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:35,844
Rym: But when it comes to any sort of computer device That's such an ephemeral world and it's one of those we don't understand it.

259
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:41,670
Scott: if something has even one Legitimate use I don't think it's right to say you can't have that now.

260
00:19:41,872 --> 00:19:43,810
Scott: Let me finish the details of the story.

261
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:49,509
Scott: The guy basically we didn't know he was arrested until all the charges are dropped and he was able to talk about it.

262
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:54,928
Scott: but basically what happened is he went and he was explaining to the police about Tor and they didn't get it.

263
00:19:54,948 --> 00:20:01,870
Scott: and Then some people had to come and explain it and they sort of said oh we made a mistake and they let him go.

264
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,137
Scott: No, this seems to have a lot only that.

265
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:07,950
Scott: but the whole time they never took down the tour server or anything.

266
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:12,063
Scott: They just knew that that guy was associated with that server and they got him.

267
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,749
Scott: Oh never touching the server.

268
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:15,910
Scott: Wow That shows their incompetence.

269
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:18,178
Rym: That's the exact opposite of the u.s.

270
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,670
Rym: Where if they suspect you or something they pretty much the server was far away somewhere.

271
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,762
Rym: Oh, they're I just couldn't find it who knows?

272
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:34,990
Rym: but seriously in the u.s I don't know all you non-us Ian's but if you're are even suspected of a computer crime of any kind You know like to do a crime of any kind Warrant to come into your house and they see computers they take them.

273
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,950
Rym: They'll pretty much take all your computers and oftentimes you just will never see him again.

274
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:50,520
Scott: Yeah, if you are any sort of criminal where they get to go into your house and you know raid it Even you're not taking all computer stuff Absolutely everything because they just love finding evidence on your computer.

275
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:58,490
Rym: That's why you have a bluetooth or wireless sand That's hidden in the ducts or that's why you just encrypt your hard drive.

276
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,875
Rym: No, no, cuz I don't care.

277
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:02,685
Rym: if they you know, oh no, they're gonna get my data.

278
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:12,477
Rym: They see that I look at Deviant something porn and I visit I don't know bad websites like FARC But I don't want to lose my data.

279
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:17,558
Rym: So if I have a wireless saying I don't care if they see what I had I just don't want them to take it and not give it back.

280
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:18,001
Scott: Oh, let's see.

281
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:27,517
Scott: You know what they do when you When they come to get you most of the time all the police at least untrained, you know Untechnical police in this country.

282
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,570
Scott: I've looked into what they do when they're doing investigations.

283
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,730
Scott: They have this program called in case which is you know, isn't that the thing that only runs in Windows?

284
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,593
Scott: Well, no, it's.

285
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:39,010
Scott: it's a program that has been held up, you know in the court of law in the United States.

286
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:54,422
Scott: so evidence collected by in cases submissible in court and Admissible in court and all it does is look at your hard drive on the bit level, you know It understands a bunch of different types of file systems and it collects all the files It can find on your.

287
00:21:54,442 --> 00:22:04,409
Scott: you know Reading your hard drive sort of at the lowest level it sort of tries to reconstruct your file system Figure out what kind they are and pick out whatever files it can possibly find.

288
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,101
Rym: granted There are a lot of ways around and that's deniable encryption.

289
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:19,112
Scott: Yes, but that's all they can do They don't you know, they they very few police other than I guess You know some high-level FBI type people will be intelligent enough or have the training enough to do any other sort of Investigations.

290
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:26,450
Scott: if you know wireless San in your ducks and you didn't have a hard drive in your computer They would run there in case they'd be like, hey, there's no hard drives.

291
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:28,558
Rym: What do you do with the hard drives?

292
00:22:28,578 --> 00:22:30,490
Rym: they pray accuse you of tampering with the evidence.

293
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:32,729
Scott: Yeah, they wouldn't have the fuck clue what to do.

294
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:37,649
Rym: That's why what you do is you have a dummy hard drive with Windows 95 and like some spyware and that's it.

295
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:43,330
Rym: Yeah, and then your defense is the spyware did it and meanwhile your sand full of wares is just fine in the ducts.

296
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,465
Scott: That's a good way to go.

297
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:48,563
Rym: Anyway, we're not here to tell you exactly how to break the law and get away with it.

298
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,687
Rym: That's for another Monday show.

299
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,814
Rym: Haha I don't know that.

300
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:54,750
Rym: it seems like a much more a lower level issue.

301
00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:12,370
Rym: Is that and this happens all over the world now, there are encounters between citizens of countries and law enforcement where law enforcement either are ignorant of the law or Ignorant of the crime and as a result when in doubt They really can't do anything but arrest people and it just causes trouble.

302
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:17,064
Scott: I think the problem is is if they really stood by innocent until proven guilty.

303
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:19,130
Scott: when in doubt you don't arrest people.

304
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,738
Scott: Well, the problem is now.

305
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,507
Rym: I'm not arguing either way.

306
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:31,106
Rym: I'm just pointing out I think the real problem there is that Innocent until proven guilty or innocent beyond a reasonable doubt when it comes to technology and things on the internet.

307
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:48,909
Rym: I Can say as an as a technology expert, I think Scott will agree that Situations where there isn't a reasonable doubt practically don't exist because there are so many ways That someone else could have committed any computer crime and there's almost no way to prove that you did jack or shit on the

308
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:54,802
Scott: unless You have physical evidence like a camera Videotaping me at a computer in a building.

309
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:56,790
Scott: I broke into typing away

310
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,897
Rym: Yeah I mean if you want to get away

311
00:23:58,997 --> 00:24:08,351
Scott: or in my possession files on Disks that that are contained illegal things that I definitely put there because you know But you

312
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:11,470
Rym: have to have physical evidence that you put them there because you can't prove that.

313
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:23,286
Rym: Oh, well, the computer might have been compromised, you know on a non networked machine in my house at CD ROM Fingerprints are on the CD like that, but I mean technology things like the RIAA.

314
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:36,704
Rym: now that everyone's fighting the lawsuits It's turning out that wait a minute they can't prove it all that anyone did anything because all they have to go on is an IP address and There if all your evidence is electronic, there is always reasonable doubt.

315
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:38,370
Scott: You might as well just not even go to trial.

316
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:43,190
Rym: I think the only exception to that is certain kinds of data that are signed cryptographically.

317
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:48,049
Scott: Yeah, just about in which case you have no evidence because you can't decrypt it.

318
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:57,473
Rym: Well, maybe if a conversation were signed and you can then say yeah beyond a reasonable doubt that person X sent this data To person.

319
00:24:57,513 --> 00:25:00,482
Rym: why I guess two people communicated this much data.

320
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:02,930
Rym: We can't say more than that, but we know that fact.

321
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,989
Scott: Yep, you could do that, right?

322
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,759
Rym: It's time for sempre knee of the day.

323
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,746
Scott: All right, that's not gonna go and stop it.

324
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:19,094
Rym: What it's no good I believe you started it.

325
00:25:19,495 --> 00:25:20,358
Scott: I didn't start it.

326
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,743
Rym: Ah, right.

327
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,148
Scott: Anyways in like the 70s.

328
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:32,435
Rym: So I remember a while ago we talked about as a thing of the day one of them some of those old old old flash Incredibly

329
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:33,927
Scott: old school beats,

330
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:43,880
Rym: you know those old kind of pre mean like before or around the time of all your base flash videos like coinbad or Hyaku Hyaku go juichi

331
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,885
Scott: never do coin bird.

332
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:45,970
Rym: Yes, I did coin bird.

333
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,684
Rym: Okay, I did coin bird as an example of those things gone.

334
00:25:48,785 --> 00:25:54,627
Rym: horribly wrong All right, but I think Hyaku go juichi is the most well-known.

335
00:25:54,667 --> 00:26:02,370
Rym: That's the one with The Pokemons and the dead hobo in the room and Colin mockery and fee we Herman.

336
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:07,290
Rym: Yeah, well right around that time possibly a little bit before I don't remember exactly.

337
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:17,990
Rym: there was another one that was commonly known to his hat baby and The URL which is gone now was Colin was talking about it and I forgot it But he I watched a bit of it today and I remembered it now.

338
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,680
Rym: This is a this is really old and poorly done.

339
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,456
Rym: But now that I know the whole story It's actually a lot more interesting.

340
00:26:25,476 --> 00:26:26,880
Rym: They would have thought I'll tell the story.

341
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,310
Rym: Well, the original URL was come dot to slash Hatton.

342
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,055
Scott: Oh, I remember now.

343
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:32,516
Scott: Yeah.

344
00:26:32,617 --> 00:26:38,937
Rym: Yeah, and this is one of those things where the people would pass links around like hey Check this out zombocom.

345
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:39,579
Rym: Oh man.

346
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,743
Rym: Well, I'll trade you back.

347
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:41,767
Rym: Check out this thing.

348
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:42,730
Rym: come to dot Hatton.

349
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:46,430
Rym: Well, the video doesn't make any sense.

350
00:26:46,671 --> 00:27:00,847
Rym: It's basically a bunch of poorly pixelated people with a hat that kind of moves from person to person and this happy old guy and The song is spelled out phonetically with fake subtitles, but unlike Hyaku go juichi.

351
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:02,695
Rym: It's Gibberish.

352
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:04,626
Rym: Well, it's not actually gibberish.

353
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:05,250
Rym: It's Swedish.

354
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:16,242
Rym: You see apparently in 1984 in Lebanon someone recorded a song called Hobby tick for the wedding of the daughter of one of his friends and it's sung in Arabic.

355
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:17,786
Rym: I'm paraphrasing from the website here.

356
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:23,901
Rym: in 1984 plus aka 1985 in Sweden.

357
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:30,130
Rym: a UN officer named Nyberg Got a cassette of this music brought it back to Sweden and gave it to his son Patrick.

358
00:27:30,992 --> 00:27:50,655
Rym: So in the 90s Patrick and his friends were drunk and they realized that the name of the song how beat ik sounds kind of like the translated Habib is singing in Swedish and A lot of the words in the song if sounded phonetically kind of sound like things from a popular drinking song in Sweden that involves a hat.

359
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:51,457
Scott: Uh-huh.

360
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:57,760
Rym: So someone made an mp3 flash combination and Among all the people in Sweden.

361
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,089
Rym: This was like the funniest thing ever.

362
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:05,030
Scott: I imagine if I was Swedish and I was familiar with the song and the drinking game It would be the funniest thing ever.

363
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,550
Rym: So it came to the US and people found it and they still thought it was funny.

364
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:13,456
Rym: But just because they thought it was weird the same way He was right.

365
00:28:13,617 --> 00:28:18,013
Rym: Hyaku go juichi is whatever he's whatever The point.

366
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:23,430
Rym: actually I had no idea what that word was for like five years until Emily told me the point is.

367
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:29,170
Rym: The point is is that well the real point the thing of the day is not just oh, here's the history of hat, baby.

368
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:33,206
Rym: And oh, here's an archive of hat baby where you can watch it.

369
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:33,628
Rym: I'll warn you.

370
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:34,190
Rym: It's pretty bad.

371
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:43,830
Rym: Someone made this website that explains the entire history of this with translations explanations pictures screenshots the whole deal.

372
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:48,160
Rym: Mad props to this person for tracking down all this information.

373
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,263
Scott: It could just be made up.

374
00:28:49,985 --> 00:28:51,730
Rym: I'm reasonably certain that this is true.

375
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,536
Rym: I validated it from numerous sources.

376
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:57,830
Rym: I looked at all other other people who have translated the song and gotten similar results.

377
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:03,637
Scott: Okay, then yeah, whatever Alright, so my thing of the day.

378
00:29:03,857 --> 00:29:07,770
Scott: It's a video site, but this video site the videos aren't really that great.

379
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,190
Scott: I didn't watch them until today, but they didn't really entertain.

380
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:13,518
Scott: However, it is still thing of the day worthy.

381
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,663
Scott: This site is called.

382
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:15,526
Scott: I hate young people.

383
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:16,409
Rym: calm, huh?

384
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:24,230
Scott: Damn kids get off my lawn And I think the point of this site is they want to get videos of old people complaining about punk kids.

385
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,839
Rym: So what the kids move too quick?

386
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:32,088
Scott: I can't see him can't get him with the shotgun something like that, and there's also a few videos of punk kids complaining about old people.

387
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:48,469
Scott: and You know generally old people don't like us punk kids and they're always complaining and I like seem to forget when their parents would complain about them and they're rocking and they're rolling and now they're complaining about our hip and enter hopping That I've never got that.

388
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:55,770
Rym: And it's happened for as long as we've had civilization that the parents of any generation Think that the music of their kids is stupid

389
00:29:56,312 --> 00:30:07,855
Scott: not just the music but the entire culture of their kids they like look down on it like it's like it's crap and worthless and Like they're like, oh, it's not even music It's just just like their parents said all that rock and roll is not even music It's just noise.

390
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:09,183
Rym: and you know what we're seeing.

391
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:10,250
Rym: the same thing accelerate.

392
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:12,296
Scott: I mean the thing Nintendo fanboys.

393
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:16,008
Rym: look back look on kids who only have a ps1 or a ps2.

394
00:30:16,088 --> 00:30:16,650
Rym: is man?

395
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:18,390
Rym: You punk kids don't know anything about video games.

396
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:28,169
Scott: I don't understand though because like I Look back on the old people and I say well there was a culture and I look at the people younger than me and I said Well, there's a culture and I don't look on any of it.

397
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:34,188
Scott: Like I don't say all those punk like I don't like the emo music, but I don't say oh, that's not music It's not worth having.

398
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:40,130
Scott: But the these old people they had people treating them the same way that they're treating us when they were kids.

399
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:43,310
Scott: Listen to the rock and roll and they didn't learn the lesson at all.

400
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:44,394
Rym: What I realized

401
00:30:44,454 --> 00:30:46,020
Scott: is I learned a lot of a lot

402
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:56,670
Rym: of the complaints that old people were making just from what you were playing In the background, we're kind of weird Like young people fill up the train and get in our way and like make it difficult for me to get off the train.

403
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:00,290
Rym: But I don't think that has anything to do with a young people.

404
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:00,897
Rym: I think that's just.

405
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:02,110
Rym: you're too old to be on a train.

406
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:02,808
Scott: I think yeah.

407
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,445
Scott: I think a lot of things they perceive as being young people is like.

408
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:11,063
Scott: as they get old You get slower and then things happen to you and you can't.

409
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,750
Scott: you're not as able as you were before.

410
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:18,457
Scott: When you see the young people moving the way you moved when you were young You don't ever think that you're a slower.

411
00:31:18,698 --> 00:31:19,541
Scott: you think they're getting.

412
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:27,952
Scott: they're fast and in the way where you know Whereas actually the problem is is that you're slow and old and in the way and they're trying to get around you because you're holding Them up.

413
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:35,290
Rym: the other constant complaint that they kept bringing up was yeah these kids with technology Some that didn't wasn't even really any specific complaint.

414
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:41,030
Rym: It was just these kids got to stop it with the iPods and a statement like that doesn't make any sense.

415
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:42,949
Scott: No, it doesn't make any sense at all.

416
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:55,510
Rym: I just I can't imagine getting to a point in my life ever where I would stop advancing along with technology or where I would Say all right everything made after me is new and crap and everything made before me is old and crap.

417
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,998
Rym: And I'm staying right here where I am.

418
00:31:57,018 --> 00:31:57,501
Rym: Yep.

419
00:31:57,702 --> 00:31:59,069
Rym: How did how can someone get that way?

420
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:06,270
Scott: Stop trying especially when you're you know from a generation that was treated the way they're treating us.

421
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:07,658
Scott: It's like they didn't learn.

422
00:32:07,699 --> 00:32:09,148
Scott: they just kept the same anyway.

423
00:32:10,491 --> 00:32:14,043
Scott: The thing on this site that I find really funny is that they are.

424
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:25,273
Scott: not only do they have some videos that they took on The street obviously you know with their own camera but there's they're asking for people to submit like their own webcam videos complaining about young punk kids and As a right

425
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:27,845
Rym: what old people know how to use a digital camera.

426
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:28,709
Scott: and as of right.

427
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:32,307
Scott: now There are three videos on the site.

428
00:32:32,488 --> 00:32:36,804
Scott: one of them I didn't watch any of these but one of them is titled I hate old people.

429
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:42,050
Scott: so of the three videos And I hate young people calm that were webcam videos submitted by users.

430
00:32:42,812 --> 00:32:45,501
Scott: I think at most two of them are actually old people.

431
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:46,283
Scott: They don't look that old.

432
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:50,909
Rym: they look maybe like 30s 40s Something old people can't make 10 YouTube videos.

433
00:32:51,191 --> 00:32:59,086
Scott: It's so funny is that they're asking old people who hate this sort of thing to Use this sort of thing to be like young people to complain about you.

434
00:32:59,106 --> 00:32:59,588
Rym: Maybe it's a trap?

435
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:00,533
Scott: No wonder.

436
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:04,514
Scott: There's only three submissions and one of them is yeah a young guy It makes.

437
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:05,036
Scott: no you know.

438
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:07,690
Scott: what they should have had is they should have had old people.

439
00:33:08,171 --> 00:33:11,964
Scott: Send in you know rigging Nickelodeon's with you know.

440
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:13,850
Scott: could their complaints about young people?

441
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:18,390
Scott: You know just holding up signs and in all the pictures in black and white or something.

442
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:21,075
Scott: Or maybe send us like you know they're.

443
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:21,436
Scott: they're.

444
00:33:21,697 --> 00:33:26,048
Scott: they're Edison wax cylinders with their complaints about young people and wax cylinders.

445
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:30,199
Rym: with a business There's so much crisper than modern CDs and flak files.

446
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,242
Scott: Tell me about it.

447
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:34,350
Rym: I mean, it's analog right so the resolution is infinite.

448
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:37,168
Scott: Okay, do you wanna talk about the show now right?

449
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:39,698
Rym: so Speaking of technology.

450
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:42,930
Rym: We don't have to go long about this because it's actually a pretty to the point issue.

451
00:33:43,215 --> 00:33:44,129
Scott: Oh, I got a lot to say though.

452
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,254
Rym: Yeah, I do too, but we could.

453
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:49,410
Rym: most of the things I have to say I can actually break up into much more specific shows.

454
00:33:49,672 --> 00:34:17,429
Rym: All right the idea is simply that corporations in Particular partly because of the fact that they they outlive the people who form them And they tend to have kind of a mind of their own like bureaucracies in any other form Tend to Misapply technology and/or have problems that could be easily solved with technology that either They don't understand they could be solved or they do But they don't know how and they're unwilling to pay or listen to people who do understand.

455
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:19,891
Scott: Oh, they don't even realize they have a problem Or it's.

456
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,192
Scott: it's.

457
00:34:20,353 --> 00:34:26,770
Scott: basically the only way to sum it up in a few words is to say companies don't understand technology.

458
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:32,708
Scott: That's and I could just go into just like a million different ways in which they don't understand it.

459
00:34:32,789 --> 00:34:41,199
Scott: like People will have a company and they know they want to get something done with technology But they'll ask for something that is technologically impossible.

460
00:34:41,239 --> 00:35:02,377
Scott: like I've known two or three people already who work in like 3d animation Modeling companies in some way and someone will say Make Toy Story for me in like a day or a week, and it's like okay you obviously don't understand that that takes like a hundred million dollars and a giant facility and it takes a team of like A hundred people a few years

461
00:35:02,758 --> 00:35:04,486
Rym: or people who in a tech company.

462
00:35:04,506 --> 00:35:09,917
Rym: Here's a good example Because it's not just you know Optimistic or stupid possible solutions things.

463
00:35:09,978 --> 00:35:14,370
Rym: It's also just not using the tools you have to do a job much more efficiently.

464
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:15,897
Scott: Yeah, it's the exact opposite.

465
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:16,259
Scott: problem.

466
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:27,030
Scott: is they they want to use technology so much They want to do something impossible or there's something very possible and very easy They could do to greatly improve their business, but they don't do it or don't even think to do it.

467
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,270
Rym: You think I mean, we just need to send them to ZomboCon for like five minutes.

468
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:34,290
Scott: I mean anything's possible except making Toy Story in a day, right?

469
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,876
Rym: But like here's a good example.

470
00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:45,609
Rym: at a company I may or may not work for currently There's a form that is filled out whenever you want to make a new PC and it says you know What image to put on the PC and what?

471
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,910
Rym: Applications and what name it's gonna get and where it's gonna go and who's gonna own it and all this business.

472
00:35:50,552 --> 00:35:55,487
Rym: And it's a digital form that populates the database and then other applications pretty advanced.

473
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:56,450
Scott: They're actually doing something, right?

474
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,009
Rym: I know and that's that's what bothers me because they're so close.

475
00:36:00,402 --> 00:36:13,550
Rym: Okay so then that form is then used from about in the back end by people who can one it populates the Inventory database and two from there the people who actually do the imaging get all the information and the process is semi-automated.

476
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:30,989
Rym: So, uh say this company gets a big contract and they're gonna roll out thousands and thousands of pcs and say they Do to a weeks long effort have compiled a database of all of these pcs That have to be replaced and everything that needs to go on them.

477
00:36:31,511 --> 00:36:42,510
Rym: So now I've got a database of all the pcs that need to be put out Yep And I've got a separate incompatible database of all all the ways to make a PC that'll actually get them made.

478
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,208
Scott: so you write a script to read from one and write to reformat and write to the other.

479
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:54,519
Rym: or You ask Rym to manually do data entry into the stupid goddamn form in the one database from the other database.

480
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:56,184
Scott: because why don't you just write a script?

481
00:36:56,625 --> 00:37:10,030
Rym: because I don't have access to the back Ends of either of those databases and no one under no one hypothetically in this hypothetical company Understands that maybe you should have a DBA who could just do this and then no work needs to be done by

482
00:37:10,491 --> 00:37:12,977
Scott: That with like two SQLs and a bash.

483
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:29,258
Rym: I could probably make the point that this that the hour the billable hours that hypothetically would be spent on this hypothetical project at this hypothetical company by a hypothetical employee named Rym would cost more than Hiring a goddamn external consultant to do it.

484
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:39,990
Scott: Yeah, I think the thing is is that companies they they either Try to get there to get their hands in the technology too much or they stay away from it too much.

485
00:37:40,451 --> 00:37:43,020
Scott: This is how if you're a business person, right?

486
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:45,710
Scott: The first thing you need to do is get competent technology people.

487
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,430
Scott: I know that's difficult if you you don't know enough about technology to get good technology people.

488
00:37:50,931 --> 00:38:00,406
Scott: But let me just tell you this if you're if you're not able to fire half your company because they've been replaced by computers Then you don't have good technology people.

489
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:12,665
Scott: Yes I mean that might sound callous but in and there are a lot of exceptions to this technology people at companies I mean like it is cruel that you know Firing people and they lose their jobs because they've been replaced by machines and all that.

490
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:18,470
Scott: but regardless of that When I think about you know, setting up IT for a company to make their business run better.

491
00:38:19,153 --> 00:38:27,303
Scott: I think the measure of my success is how many people's jobs I can automate And how much less there is to do because computers do it all.

492
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:29,230
Scott: that's what I consider making it better.

493
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,555
Scott: That's what's supposed to happen.

494
00:38:30,736 --> 00:38:33,145
Rym: Yeah, and I mean there are a lot of reasons.

495
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,290
Rym: companies fuck this off.

496
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,334
Rym: You can never fire everyone.

497
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:39,190
Rym: you're always gonna need people and also a lot of times you'll make them.

498
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,317
Rym: You don't have to fire people.

499
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:46,449
Rym: instead because you've removed You know the bullshit paperwork that you know 80% of your employees have to do all the time.

500
00:38:47,212 --> 00:38:55,987
Rym: Now all that all those billable hours can now be spent on your actual company's business Which means you can either fire those people or do a bunch more business.

501
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:07,290
Scott: Yep But basically what you want to do to hit is first get the good technology people, which might be hard But once you have good technology people, all you have to do is tell them what you want.

502
00:39:07,672 --> 00:39:09,582
Scott: So for example, this is a good idea.

503
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:13,088
Scott: come to Scott and say hey Scott I need a list of this.

504
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:18,147
Scott: Alright, if you just tell me that I'll have a list of that in like a you know a second cuz.

505
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:18,950
Scott: I just know the command.

506
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,235
Scott: I just whoop and there it is.

507
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:24,310
Rym: Yeah now maybe a technologist like if you ask me make a Cisco router that does blah.

508
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:28,968
Rym: I don't remember all the syntax offhand, but you know what by the next by 24 hours from now?

509
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,650
Rym: I've already looked it up and done it.

510
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,796
Scott: See what I think saying is Cisco.

511
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,370
Scott: rather does blah is already too deep for them to be telling?

512
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,013
Scott: Well, yeah true.

513
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:39,714
Scott: They want to say you want to say we need to have these computers, you know Not even that.

514
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,570
Scott: they want to say we want actually able to do this.

515
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:49,340
Rym: I think you inadvertently brought up a big issue that the core issue The core deal here is not just that they don't understand technology.

516
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:58,558
Rym: Yeah, I think the real problem is that a lot of businesses Don't document and don't understand their own business Processes on any fundamental level at all.

517
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:02,330
Rym: and a lot of people say oh like ISO certification all those things are BS.

518
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:11,581
Rym: But a lot of those business II type certifications what they really do is come into your company and look Do you have a process an actual process as in?

519
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:14,169
Rym: could an outside person come in?

520
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,620
Rym: Look at a product like an input and an output.

521
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:29,132
Rym: an input being customer wants X output being Product is shipped to customer and could they read Documentation that would follow the path of that product and all the things that an employee has to do at each step of the way From start to finish.

522
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:39,590
Scott: Yeah, for example, if I came to your factory and I got a job as assembly guy assembly line guy number 10 Is there a piece of paper or a binder of papers that tell me how to do that job?

523
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,781
Scott: And could I read that binder and then perform that job?

524
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:45,310
Scott: because that should be true of every job.

525
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:47,499
Scott: There should be a binder that says how the job is done.

526
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:51,295
Rym: Yes, obviously there are exceptions for highly technical Highly.

527
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:54,030
Scott: Well, you don't say well, I mean for example for my job, right?

528
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,809
Scott: You wouldn't say do this exact thing to do the job here.

529
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,990
Rym: Let me break it down because I actually deal with this a lot on an enterprise level.

530
00:41:01,473 --> 00:41:04,010
Rym: What you need to look at is not you know what the person does.

531
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,339
Rym: It's more what are the inputs and outputs at each stage?

532
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:10,208
Rym: and then can you reduce the number of inputs?

533
00:41:10,328 --> 00:41:10,829
Rym: or can you?

534
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,766
Rym: Lessen the impact of these inputs on the person doing the process.

535
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:28,002
Rym: Mm-hmm And I could go into stupid boring detail about it but a lot of businesses even very large businesses and I've worked for a couple of very large companies and I can say for a Fact that a lot of them don't bother with this though.

536
00:41:28,062 --> 00:41:29,489
Rym: Actually IBM was really good about it.

537
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:42,090
Rym: Mm-hmm If you don't understand your processes and I mean really understand them Then no amount of technology is gonna help you because you're not even going to be able to ask a technologist to do your process.

538
00:41:42,593 --> 00:41:44,684
Rym: Yeah, so forget technology.

539
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:45,650
Rym: That's not even the issue.

540
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:50,950
Rym: You need to understand what your business does long before you can hire someone like me or Scott to make it go better.

541
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:57,280
Scott: But even then if you just hire someone like me and you don't even know your process Odds are give you or any.

542
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:06,989
Scott: like any company I've ever seen I can just walk in and hang around your business for a few days Probably a few hours and immediately see things that could be vastly improved by technology.

543
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:09,115
Rym: Yeah I mean God my company.

544
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:16,557
Rym: now I could definitely I could I'm dead serious single-handedly revolutionized the way my company works Yeah, and it would be trivial.

545
00:42:16,878 --> 00:42:18,464
Rym: I wouldn't even need to hire extra people.

546
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:21,315
Rym: I could do it in the spare time I have at work now.

547
00:42:21,657 --> 00:42:22,963
Scott: Yeah, I go.

548
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:34,630
Scott: every place I've worked, you know I look at the way things are done and I say well if I just did this This job would take like 10 minutes a day instead of two full-time people.

549
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:46,137
Rym: the thing is though that sort of argument isn't really feasible because in a large corporation or even a medium-sized one with Bureaucracy and with you know, the business is running and all that sort of thing It's not really fair to say.

550
00:42:46,298 --> 00:43:04,187
Rym: Oh just hire a technologist and they'll fix things for you because while that's kind of true Oftentimes if you do it that way the solution that is put in Won't always be the most documented thing or more importantly you won't understand what the person did So you won't be able to ask him or anyone else how to make it better.

551
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:19,313
Scott: Yep Also, the thing is that you know, the only excuse I think because a lot of people say, ah, you know The technology fails to help the business to the full potential because the people in the business not understanding not caring Etc.

552
00:43:19,353 --> 00:43:19,735
Scott: etc.

553
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:32,226
Scott: But there's only one excuse that I think is the okay excuse for Not improving your business with technology to make it You know more efficient when possible and that is profits because there are cases where.

554
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:39,910
Scott: well we could do this And if we did that it would make all this work easier and such but that would cost us like a bajillion dollars.

555
00:43:40,072 --> 00:43:47,570
Rym: We don't have for example Say my business process is really dumb and anyone could do all the steps of the way and it's super labor-intensive.

556
00:43:48,156 --> 00:43:55,830
Rym: But because anyone can do it I hire a bunch of nobody replaceable people and that's a lot cheaper than streamlining the process and hiring competent people

557
00:43:56,171 --> 00:44:02,550
Scott: Yep, or even just hiring one computer guy who will set up a computer to do the work at these 10 minimum wage people.

558
00:44:03,105 --> 00:44:10,938
Scott: You know I mean like you think about how much it costs to like buy and maintain a machine that flips burgers Versus just hiring some teenagers.

559
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:11,339
Scott: Yeah,

560
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:26,106
Rym: that's why a lot despite the fact that people say they will be eventually McDonald's and Burger Kings are not automated in the US because labor even in a country like this with you know Inflated standard of living and everything is so much cheaper than technology for menial job.

561
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:30,390
Scott: and then even then okay So you the machine is cheaper than the employees, right?

562
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,550
Scott: I gotta maintain them you gotta maintain the machine even then it's still cheaper.

563
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:37,001
Scott: You have to pay the guy who maintains the machine and that guy.

564
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:41,810
Scott: you know, he's a smart guy and he needs a lot of Money, he's not gonna work for the chump change.

565
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:47,110
Scott: But that guy for that one guy you could hire like a thousand burger flipping kids.

566
00:44:47,331 --> 00:45:00,310
Rym: But for most companies, especially medium-sized and larger Larger companies that have a bunch of people sitting in offices like doing paperwork If you have more than say a hundred employees then I say this is almost universally true.

567
00:45:00,952 --> 00:45:15,554
Rym: If you understand your business process and document it and then you go to Technologists and say I want to implement this process better Nine times out of ten that's going to happen and your company's gonna save so much money You can't even

568
00:45:15,574 --> 00:45:16,845
Scott: believe at least in the long run.

569
00:45:16,885 --> 00:45:27,526
Scott: in the short term You're gonna have to spend thousands of dollars on computer equipment, but in the long run You're gonna save so much money on paying people to do crap and wasting time doing crap.

570
00:45:27,546 --> 00:45:28,850
Scott: You were wasting time on before.

571
00:45:29,031 --> 00:45:31,198
Rym: Yeah, but I guess I can't stress this enough.

572
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:34,950
Rym: The issue is not oh people just don't understand technology.

573
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,639
Rym: The issue is people don't understand their own businesses.

574
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:41,090
Rym: Therefore not understanding technology is not actually hurting them that much.

575
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:44,804
Scott: Yeah, even if they did understand their own business, it's they don't.

576
00:45:44,984 --> 00:45:46,048
Scott: really they don't.

577
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:53,590
Scott: It's like they can't grasp completely how technology can help them and to technology people who also don't understand the business.

578
00:45:54,072 --> 00:45:59,210
Scott: Sometimes it's really obvious to us how certain business processes could be extremely streamlined.

579
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,641
Scott: Like I see people like for example in my job, right?

580
00:46:02,681 --> 00:46:05,610
Scott: Someone was they were faxing in pieces of paper.

581
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:11,830
Scott: All right, someone was manually checking over those faxes one at a time and entering them into a spreadsheet, right?

582
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:28,510
Scott: so we made a web form and we the people who are sending in the fax is now fill out the web form which goes directly into the database and then if you want a report I push a button and a report comes out and Without someone like me they wouldn't know that that was even possible or an idea or anything.

583
00:46:28,963 --> 00:46:30,678
Scott: Yeah Yet it improves that.

584
00:46:30,718 --> 00:46:35,730
Scott: that's now the person who looked over the faxes Doesn't have to do that anymore saving hours and hours.

585
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,234
Rym: I guess I should clarify that.

586
00:46:37,355 --> 00:46:45,779
Rym: for a business with very simple or very obvious and trivial business processes Then the business process angle doesn't apply.

587
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:52,139
Rym: but for larger companies or companies that have complex business processes Almost no amount of because you know, that's the thing.

588
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:56,729
Rym: a company that big they think oh we got to be all high-tech It's the higher tech people to do tech stuff.

589
00:46:57,211 --> 00:47:09,025
Rym: but if they don't understand what those tech people actually need to do specifically at least in terms of The technology needs to have these inputs and these outputs Then the technology is gonna fail and not be efficient and cost a lot of money.

590
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:15,610
Rym: and then they'll think oh, yeah Those technology people fucked us and then they won't ever try to increase the technology again in the future.

591
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:20,450
Scott: Well in many ways it mirrors, you know average consumers buying technology at the stores.

592
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,470
Scott: They don't understand their own needs.

593
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:31,639
Scott: They buy things that don't meet their needs or exceed their needs and they're just not wise when it comes to Solving their problems with technology.

594
00:47:32,061 --> 00:47:34,390
Scott: and that is the one, you know people think all computer nerds.

595
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,165
Scott: They know how to make these crazy machines work.

596
00:47:36,225 --> 00:47:45,790
Scott: what we do But most importantly is we know how the best ways to get the machines to make life easier And a lot of people don't do that.

597
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:51,097
Scott: You see people like with their Windows machines full of a bunch of programs everywhere And it's it just shows you.

598
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:52,544
Scott: they have this machine and they might know how to.

599
00:47:52,705 --> 00:48:02,043
Scott: I am an email and stuff But they don't know how to do things in a way that Significantly increases the productivity in their life or saves them a lot of time.

600
00:48:02,263 --> 00:48:04,590
Scott: That's really the purpose of these machines.

601
00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:12,770
Rym: That's why there's such a stigma especially among I don't want to say older people because that's a stereotype That's I mean there's truth in it, but it's definitely not globally true.

602
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:20,290
Rym: but people who aren't as familiar with Technology tend to look down as technology saying that it's not actually more efficient or it's just a time waster.

603
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:21,275
Rym: It's not any better.

604
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:24,430
Rym: and a lot of that's just because they don't understand how to use the technology.

605
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:32,820
Rym: Yeah I mean I my computer and a lot of that is that other people don't understand how to use it either and they see all These people who should know not knowing and it just.

606
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:35,170
Rym: it's kind of this self-perpetuating stigma.

607
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:35,792
Rym: Yeah,

608
00:48:36,535 --> 00:48:51,250
Scott: and I think that that's really if you want to get ahead in the technology world You have to be able you have to be yet to get the skill and the knowledge to know How you check now not just how to use a computer or how to program it or whatever but how to apply?

609
00:48:51,650 --> 00:49:00,630
Scott: technology to solve problems and make life better for Individual people and groups of people in a very significant way and be able to execute on that.

610
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:02,897
Rym: Yep, and that is where I mean IT.

611
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:03,780
Rym: I'm an IT guy.

612
00:49:03,801 --> 00:49:04,824
Rym: I'm an IT professional.

613
00:49:04,844 --> 00:49:06,550
Rym: I've worked at like super big corporations.

614
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:07,417
Rym: I have a degree.

615
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:08,950
Rym: Scott has a degree in computer science.

616
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:21,430
Rym: But while I can configure routers and configure switches and write firewall rules That's not the value of a technologist because you can hire someone fresh out of you can buy a book at borders.

617
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:31,410
Rym: No not even that you can hire some high school kid who got his MSCE and his CDNA who can do those jobs just as well as I can because it's basically making license plates.

618
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:36,550
Rym: It's trivial once you once someone knows the commands to type the commands don't change.

619
00:49:37,095 --> 00:49:45,410
Rym: The important part is Someone who can look at a business and say you need this router and you need these computers and this system.

620
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:56,951
Rym: I'll tell you who to hire to make that work and then that person doesn't have to do anything else But the person who can go to a business or a person and say based on what they tell them and by questioning them and interrogating Them.

621
00:49:57,473 --> 00:49:58,858
Rym: All right based on what you've told me.

622
00:49:58,878 --> 00:50:02,410
Rym: I think I have a solution in mind that will meet all of your needs.

623
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:03,723
Scott: Yeah, I can come in.

624
00:50:03,783 --> 00:50:12,076
Scott: I could set up you know a database cluster and a web application and a client-side application and With that you should be able to.

625
00:50:12,257 --> 00:50:18,199
Scott: it'll cost you this much right now, but in another year It's gonna save you this much time and this much money.

626
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:25,290
Rym: companies need to be willing to hire people who will honestly Appraise the situation and just tell them exactly what needs to be done.

627
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:30,150
Scott: You need to let those people do what they want to do and don't try to mess with them because they know better than you.

628
00:50:30,451 --> 00:50:31,737
Rym: Yeah, it's a matter of translation.

629
00:50:31,817 --> 00:50:44,750
Rym: It's the person who translates between the business speak, you know well, I got 40 users and they need to access their web jiggers and The IT guy just translates that into Scott speak which is all right.

630
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:47,124
Rym: I'm gonna make a database that does this and put it on this server and do that.

631
00:50:47,486 --> 00:50:49,695
Rym: Yep I think we're done.

632
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:51,282
Scott: I guess they're just generally pissed off.

633
00:50:51,302 --> 00:51:01,006
Scott: when we see companies, you know working We see people going to work and we see people doing things like using a spreadsheet for a day Having a database and not we'll make it up.

634
00:51:01,026 --> 00:51:02,812
Rym: close and personal Podcasting.

635
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,118
Rym: this is a podcast right?

636
00:51:04,338 --> 00:51:17,508
Rym: Yeah it take and this is no exaggeration All of our all the people we know who do podcasts with rare exceptions It take in the time it takes them to record edit and put up one hours worth of content.

637
00:51:17,548 --> 00:51:18,170
Rym: We do a whole week.

638
00:51:18,511 --> 00:51:20,542
Rym: Yep, no exaggeration none.

639
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:21,930
Scott: I mean you do more than a week.

640
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:36,429
Scott: This show will be uploaded and done within four minutes of me hitting stop Wow, yeah, and other people, you know, listen to their entire show and then while they edit it that way So that would at least take us an hour per show.

641
00:51:37,132 --> 00:51:38,336
Scott: This shows probably over what.

642
00:51:38,356 --> 00:51:40,704
Rym: now the whole process is automated.

643
00:51:41,387 --> 00:51:52,920
Rym: once we're done recording I click make the show and then I type upload dot py Basically and I have programs that do all the post-processing.

644
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,524
Rym: everything's uploaded it.

645
00:51:54,945 --> 00:52:04,978
Scott: it would take a human hours to do this But it takes a computer seconds and that's why computers are great And that's why all the people using garage band and when they edit their show They listen to the entire show all the way.

646
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:13,630
Rym: and that's why I searched on Craigslist for podcast And I realized that there's a lot of money in consulting for companies who want to do a podcast but don't understand how?
