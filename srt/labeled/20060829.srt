1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,742
Scott: It's Tuesday August 29th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:15,046
Scott: We discussed the board game.

3
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:20,693
Scott: I just purchased rah Let's do this Today.

4
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:24,050
Rym: for various reasons I had to meet with the CEO of my company.

5
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:28,969
Scott: You know the CEO of my company walks into my office in his pajamas and says hey, what's going on?

6
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,617
Rym: You know when I worked for IBM.

7
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,370
Rym: I never personally saw Paul Masano.

8
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:36,726
Rym: I never even was in the same room as him ever.

9
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:40,139
Scott: that company was Stupid big compared to the company I work at now.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,693
Scott: the company you work at now can't be that much bigger than the one I Work at.

11
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:44,135
Rym: the company.

12
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:47,450
Rym: I work at now is many times bigger than the company you work at.

13
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:48,534
Scott: I know the company work.

14
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,418
Scott: It's pretty big.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,869
Rym: how many people do you think work for your company?

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,230
Scott: They got an office in New York and I was in DC an office in Wisconsin and office in Louisiana.

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,169
Rym: So give or take how many people are in an office?

18
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,659
Scott: Hundreds couple hundred, I don't know.

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,422
Rym: all right a hundred yeah, I Think my company is kind of bigger all right.

20
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:12,134
Rym: Maybe it is yeah I can't really see.

21
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:12,856
Rym: I'm not a wall.

22
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:14,361
Rym: I didn't sign any ndas.

23
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:21,682
Rym: I kind of like where I'm working, so I'm not nearly as Forthwith in terms of giving up information about where I work.

24
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:26,037
Scott: I like I think also because the place you work Isn't a giant place like IBM.

25
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:28,970
Scott: No one really cares about what's going on there at all.

26
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:36,319
Rym: Yeah, well the thing is people would care because I do cool stuff, but they wouldn't care like NDA care.

27
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:36,702
Rym: yeah.

28
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:43,170
Scott: Well you can always talk about it without naming names and just to get generic office stories.

29
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:45,990
Rym: Yeah, yeah, cuz I know here's the one thing at least IBM.

30
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,210
Rym: I knew that many of my co-workers listen to GeekNights.

31
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:53,129
Rym: No one or I work now knows anything about this show, and I'd like to keep it that way.

32
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:54,575
Scott: Yeah, you think it's.

33
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:58,970
Scott: I think it's pretty weird like the people I work with are real internet savvy.

34
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:07,108
Scott: You know at least the three other people in the IT department yet None of them seem to have found my blog or GeekNights or anything like that.

35
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:14,381
Scott: either They're really good at not letting on and not caring or They just don't care to find or search for me or anything like that.

36
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:18,630
Rym: see if I were hiring people from my company I would just Google for their name.

37
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,840
Scott: That's what I would and all sorts of stuff, but a lot of it.

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,061
Scott: Well.

39
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:24,850
Scott: I guess my blog existed before they googled.

40
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,387
Scott: But maybe they just said oh he has a blog and don't care to read it.

41
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:29,535
Rym: Yeah, I'd read it.

42
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:38,796
Rym: I would totally read it, but then again I just don't think most of the people where I work are that tech savvy because I Just I I get that impression.

43
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:46,761
Rym: I mean the problems that people have with their computers that I overhear or The types of work that they do.

44
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:48,690
Rym: I just don't think they get it at all.

45
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,808
Rym: I don't think they know anything about Linux or open source or anything.

46
00:02:52,828 --> 00:03:01,581
Scott: yeah I really can't understand like someone who has a job but like I mean They don't care about what they're doing.

47
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:03,250
Rym: I mean I don't care about what I mean.

48
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:06,278
Scott: I don't care about what specifically the tasks.

49
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:13,178
Scott: I have been assigned at this job, but I care about Computing in general, and I do computing.

50
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:21,230
Scott: you know it's like a dentist might not care about this particular filling He's giving to a person, but he cares about dentistry and dental hygiene.

51
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,169
Scott: You know he has something to say about it.

52
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:30,210
Scott: How could you be a dentist who has nothing to say about dentistry or an IT worker who has nothing to say about IT?

53
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,950
Rym: Well, I guess it's more that a lot of the people I work with aren't in really technical positions.

54
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:44,900
Rym: I mean I've kind of transcended the level of you know doing tech work like developing for something I do a lot more high-level which means I don't work with tech.

55
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,310
Rym: I work more with paperwork, and you know basic problem-solving.

56
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:53,063
Rym: It seems like the higher up you get in an organization the less real work you do.

57
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,190
Scott: yeah, it really makes no sense.

58
00:03:55,732 --> 00:04:05,289
Rym: Yeah, I mean at IBM my choices were basically sit where I was doing the same thing forever Or try to get into management where I'd basically do less real work, but get more money.

59
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,730
Scott: But you had to stay there longer.

60
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,659
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

61
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:17,750
Rym: all things considered I wouldn't terribly have minded staying at IBM because while I didn't make nearly as much money My commute was only like 10 minutes.

62
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,060
Rym: Yeah, because I'm not moving down to Yonkers.

63
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,481
Rym: good.

64
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:21,841
Rym: God.

65
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:22,907
Rym: I'm not living in Yonkers.

66
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:24,880
Rym: No no no I don't mind working there.

67
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:35,146
Rym: the tax thingy The tax thing is not even so bad even though the fact that I have to pay taxes to Yonkers even though I don't live in there bothers me on a level you cannot understand.

68
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:46,979
Rym: yeah, I Really really get angry every time I see that and Yonkers is justification for this tax is such horseshit But I can't vote in Yonkers.

69
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:50,309
Rym: I have no say over this tax or this money or anything.

70
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:54,472
Scott: oh It's taxation without Representation.

71
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:58,250
Scott: yeah, yeah time to have a pilot and bloody revolution.

72
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,750
Scott: Oh, yeah, like they did 200 plus years ago over the same exact issue.

73
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:03,155
Rym: I believe.

74
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:09,990
Rym: of course that was only a cover But that's not the point of my favorite t-shirt sets cuz I saw some punk guy wearing it actually down in the Bronx today.

75
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:12,105
Rym: It was a black shirt, and it had this.

76
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:15,138
Rym: you know those Propaganda style picture.

77
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:16,929
Rym: you know high contrast kind of images.

78
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:21,369
Rym: yep There was one and it showed Ben Franklin, and it said terrorist.

79
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:27,709
Rym: Then on the back is your George Washington, and it said terrorist.

80
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:29,677
Scott: It's the greatest.

81
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,088
Scott: I gotta get me one of those.

82
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:33,259
Scott: yeah Anything to the guy.

83
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:34,650
Rym: I didn't really have a chance.

84
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,192
Rym: I mean one.

85
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:38,890
Rym: the guy was you know just some guy walking on the street listening to his iPod.

86
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:40,721
Rym: I was on my way to a meeting.

87
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,009
Rym: you know you know soup.

88
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:47,289
Rym: Yeah, I generally don't talk to people on the street.

89
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,576
Rym: Yeah Unless they're the falafel guy.

90
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:54,050
Rym: the falafel guy the falafel guy is my best friend in all of Brooklyn or all of the Bronx.

91
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,416
Rym: I don't know why I said Brooklyn.

92
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:58,249
Rym: Yeah, I haven't been to Brooklyn in over a year, okay.

93
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:01,136
Scott: So before we do the news.

94
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:04,732
Rym: yeah, if you can't tell we were kind of padding out because we don't have so much for this Episode.

95
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:06,220
Scott: yeah before we do the news.

96
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:07,849
Scott: I got some geek back action.

97
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,278
Scott: Orderly the return of the geek back.

98
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,830
Scott: this geek back is from Colin from, California.

99
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:19,507
Scott: Cuz he went he to Worldcon.

100
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:27,323
Scott: He went to Worldcon and that's apparently some cool sci-fi con.

101
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:29,950
Rym: were you trying to make a fake thought bird?

102
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:33,350
Rym: Yes, were you thinking of ripping anime world order off poorly?

103
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:39,187
Scott: Yeah, that was fantastic because we didn't get our special thought bird replacement in.

104
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:40,330
Scott: yet, it's coming in the mail.

105
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:40,926
Rym: Oh, you mean?

106
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,055
Scott: No, no not that one.

107
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,341
Rym: How about born we won.

108
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:47,384
Rym: We to you all.

109
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:50,873
Scott: that's close, but not it my wife That's the one.

110
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:51,494
Scott: that's the one.

111
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:52,096
Scott: that's the one.

112
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:55,668
Rym: all right props to anyone who knows what all of those quotes were from.

113
00:06:55,828 --> 00:07:04,743
Scott: yeah, so Colin went to Worldcon which is some sci-fi con in Anaheim, California, and he put out 1,200 GeekNights flyers.

114
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:05,870
Scott: cuz he is too awesome.

115
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,135
Rym: Yes, mad props.

116
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:11,393
Rym: you were on the list of people to eventually get schwag when schwag is forthcoming Mm-hmm.

117
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:17,338
Scott: and he said he even like went through the effort of counting like the remaining flyers Which I think is crazy.

118
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,210
Rym: Wow we didn't even do that at Otakon.

119
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,253
Rym: I didn't.

120
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,477
Scott: I wouldn't do that anywhere.

121
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:25,270
Scott: I mean even it was the tiniest con where I put out one stack of flyers.

122
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:26,714
Scott: I wouldn't count the ones remaining.

123
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:37,384
Scott: It's just not worth the effort, but he says that 250 were picked up, and that's cool Hopefully if you discovered this podcast by the flyer at Worldcon.

124
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:38,227
Scott: What's up?

125
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:39,070
Scott: How you doing?

126
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,723
Rym: Because they can obviously answer you through the interweb.

127
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:44,270
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly right.

128
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,697
Scott: They can go to our forums at front row.

129
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,526
Scott: crew comm slash forum all right.

130
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,390
Rym: That was too cheesy.

131
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,334
Rym: Let's do that again.

132
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:49,555
Rym: Good.

133
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:50,780
Rym: God good.

134
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,869
Rym: God that felt like we were trying to do some sort of promo.

135
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:55,338
Rym: Remember our promos.

136
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:56,164
Rym: They're still out there.

137
00:07:56,506 --> 00:08:10,009
Scott: Yeah, yeah anyway Apparently Worldcon had 6,700 people and there was some cool science fiction fantasy and horror literature stuff going on there And he put some pictures.

138
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:12,475
Scott: The pictures he took.

139
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:23,489
Scott: there was an astro boy statue and a gigantor statue next to a Dalek Which is cool, and then he took pictures of the heek Knight's fliers in little stand to prove that he did it.

140
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,120
Rym: Yep, and he's not lying.

141
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:26,390
Rym: Yeah, we would have believed him anyway.

142
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:34,090
Rym: Yeah, I mean unless you said like yeah, I put a hundred thousand fliers at packs or something.

143
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,524
Rym: We'll believe you pretty much.

144
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:43,429
Scott: Yeah Speaking of PAX news number one packs was this most recent weekend the penny arcade expo.

145
00:08:43,489 --> 00:09:05,247
Rym: now for anyone who doesn't know We use that phrase a lot, but I stress it here because I don't think there is anyone penny arcade Was a small webcomic about gaming video gaming in particular in particular The video game industry and recent news in the video game industry.

146
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:12,850
Rym: over time It grew to be by at least an order of magnitude the most widely read webcomic known to man.

147
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:20,970
Scott: Yeah, I really don't think there are any other strictly webcomic webcomics that are beating penny arcade.

148
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:24,382
Rym: Not even close like mega Tokyo.

149
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,470
Scott: not even a chance now.

150
00:09:27,311 --> 00:09:32,368
Rym: Otakon has between 20 and 24 thousand people every year.

151
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:35,970
Rym: now Otakon has been going on for a long time.

152
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:44,908
Scott: packs had 20,000 people this yet packs and Otakon are basically equivalent in population.

153
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:48,256
Rym: as far as Essentially about now consider that for a minute.

154
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:58,387
Rym: Otakon is a con for all fans of anime manga Japanese film and culture anything Asian films kung fu.

155
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:04,310
Rym: Yeah, penny arcade expo is just a con for a webcomic.

156
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:16,866
Scott: Well, if you think about it, yes But in reality it is a gaming in terms of board gaming and you know Role-playing and tabletop gaming and also gaming as in video gaming.

157
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:17,850
Scott: It is all gaming.

158
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:25,810
Rym: Yeah Penny arcade has basically become one of the rallying points of a wide swatch swath of geeks.

159
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:28,359
Scott: Yeah, it's an edge any sort of game.

160
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:33,970
Scott: if you play games and you're a geek penny arcade They got you covered even if you don't play games.

161
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,250
Rym: It seems like PAX is going to be the biggest geek con in the country very quickly.

162
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:45,330
Scott: It's really sad that the biggest geeks in the country over here on the East Coast can't get there.

163
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:48,423
Rym: Yeah, but think of this if they have East Coast packs.

164
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:55,952
Rym: if there are two packs is a year Oh my god one in the east and one in the west each of which would probably be as big as if not bigger than Otakon.

165
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:00,890
Rym: Yeah, maybe we'd have to switch up our policy and make the week of awesome be after packs.

166
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:04,169
Scott: I think it would be Otakon week of awesome and then packs.

167
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:07,482
Rym: I don't know if my feeble brain could handle such awesome.

168
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:09,590
Scott: My brain is much less feeble.

169
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,741
Scott: Thus, I would take full advantage of the double powered quintuple.

170
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:14,784
Rym: No, you wouldn't?

171
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:22,155
Scott: you just have some sort of nerdgasm and pass out That's the same thing is what I was just saying You just translated.

172
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:22,998
Rym: Yeah.

173
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,390
Rym: No, we don't have a lot of news for I mean there's news about packs.

174
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,375
Rym: There's lots of coverage.

175
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,990
Rym: if you want coverage of packs that is on the internet.

176
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,499
Rym: We're not going to give you all of that.

177
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:38,408
Scott: No, the highlights from packs are this Cool people played guitar hero 2 which is a game that is not out yet.

178
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:44,429
Scott: There was an omega-thon as is usual at packs and the prize it was a car.

179
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:47,589
Scott: Now a guy won the car.

180
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:55,809
Rym: Now what was the final game the final test of battling between the two greatest omega knots of the year?

181
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,493
Scott: Tetris Tetris Kremlin.

182
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:01,559
Rym: Tetris not Tetris -.

183
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,870
Rym: nope, not Tetris - not Tetris DS with teaspoons.

184
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:06,942
Scott: No, not Tetris DS straight up.

185
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:08,170
Scott: Tetris straight up.

186
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,269
Scott: There was a freaking Kremlin on the screen and then there were a falling blocks and I'm pretty sure it was car.

187
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,404
Scott: I koviniki, all right.

188
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:22,450
Scott: Yeah, I couldn't really hear it that well, it might have been some other song from a ghetto arcade machine, but whatever.

189
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:27,810
Scott: Yeah, the thing about you have the only real news about the Omega thon is the guy who won.

190
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:33,210
Scott: The way it works apparently is if you are a finalist in the Omega thon, right?

191
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,570
Scott: So you are in the final match and you lose.

192
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:40,470
Scott: You get the second place prize, which is usually a pretty good prize.

193
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:43,590
Scott: I think this year it was like an Xbox and a shit ton of games and money.

194
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:48,526
Scott: You get to come back next year and go into the Omega thon again.

195
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:49,390
Scott: Good God.

196
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:55,149
Scott: So the guy who came in second in the Omega thon last year came in first this year.

197
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:57,386
Rym: Wow that sets a precedent.

198
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:57,790
Scott: no, no.

199
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:03,020
Scott: So they were asking him like hey Did you lose in the final round on purpose last year?

200
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:10,827
Scott: because you knew the final prize this year would be better than the one last year and thus he would get a second place prize and then a better first place prize.

201
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:16,829
Rym: and he was like See the thing is I wouldn't be able to do something like that.

202
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:22,370
Rym: I mean that is definitely the kind of game theory cold-hearted thinking that would make a person succeed at life.

203
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,441
Rym: You know losing purposely in order to win later on more.

204
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:27,830
Scott: I had too much pride to lose purpose.

205
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,793
Rym: yeah, I mean we.

206
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:38,707
Rym: there have been times when I tried to hustle people like an air hockey or ping-pong or Board games and such and I can't do it because I refuse to lose.

207
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:43,543
Rym: I'll think to myself I'm not gonna lose to this asshole and then I win and then that's the end of the hustle.

208
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,130
Scott: That's exactly my problem.

209
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:51,230
Scott: So you can always trust us not to hustle you and to instead kick your ass.

210
00:13:51,832 --> 00:14:08,110
Rym: Yeah, I mean if you've Scott if Scott's like let's have a Mega Man 2 competition and then he's trying to keep a straight face Where Brim says hey, I bet the bionic commando something and he doesn't start peeing his pants.

211
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:18,069
Rym: Yeah, so I can pretty much guarantee that we'll be covering packs next year in the very least East Coast packs if it happens.

212
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:26,397
Scott: if It happens and if you want to know more about what went down at PAX because many awesome things went down at PAX I mean this place.

213
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:32,330
Scott: Well, I saw I just just from watching the videos I get the feeling that it was the awesomest con ever.

214
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:39,430
Rym: I saw a quote from someone who said man if you didn't have a DS you were left out of most of this convention.

215
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:44,536
Scott: Yeah, apparently they imported mad beanbag Charage for DS action.

216
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:51,498
Rym: apparently the Best Buy that was adjacent to packs sold out of DS's like Friday.

217
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,668
Scott: who people came to pack?

218
00:14:53,808 --> 00:15:00,850
Rym: actually Yes, actually one person on slashdot specifically said that everyone had DS's and he felt left out.

219
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,890
Rym: So he went to buy a DS and all but two had been already sold in the Best Buy.

220
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,169
Rym: He said the Best Buy was barren.

221
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:16,030
Rym: Wow Yes, apparently the nerd I don't want to say nerd the geeks at PAX cleaned out this Best Buy.

222
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:17,822
Scott: Did they even buy the refrigerators?

223
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:18,607
Rym: I don't know.

224
00:15:20,074 --> 00:15:22,874
Rym: To hold their Mountain Dew, of course Obviously.

225
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:24,506
Scott: Oh shit, baby.

226
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,967
Scott: Yeah Did they buy the dryers?

227
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,163
Scott: To clean theirs to dry their sweaty shirts.

228
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:38,410
Rym: Oh And the washers to wash their brand new penny arcade merch are the overextended metaphor the joke that's not funny anymore.

229
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:48,309
Rym: Oh Yeah now speaking of the DS Because it obviously went gangbusters at every con we have been to and every con we didn't go to this year.

230
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:51,322
Rym: Except I guess I don't know dentistry cons.

231
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:52,929
Rym: I don't think the DS is real big at those.

232
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:57,470
Scott: I don't know unless DS stands for dentistry something that was lame.

233
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:04,215
Rym: Yeah, now the you know that the DS has the Wi-Fi and while I haven't used it a lot lately It it was really good.

234
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:05,079
Rym: It was really well done.

235
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,970
Rym: And there are only what like eight games that use it so far still.

236
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,216
Scott: Yeah, there are more coming.

237
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:19,370
Rym: I think the mario 3r3 basketball might use it now Despite the fact that there are only eight games that one of which just came out recently that take advantage of the Wi-Fi.

238
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:29,810
Rym: At least two million unique DS DS's have gotten online and use the Wi-Fi and they have played more than 70 million games already.

239
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:41,229
Scott: Yeah I think there was a recent spike though because a lot of people bought DS lights who had DS's and then they played their Wi-Fi game on the DS light and That kind of adds to the numbers a whole bunch.

240
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:48,190
Rym: Yeah, probably did but even so the DS Wi-Fi for being a completely free service is doing very very well.

241
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:52,670
Scott: Yeah, I wonder how many people have used Xbox Live a lot.

242
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,562
Rym: Yeah, the thing is Xbox Live is also really smooth.

243
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:56,386
Rym: that just cost money.

244
00:16:56,687 --> 00:17:00,770
Scott: Yep, of course I think it's a lot more feature-filled and possibly worth the money.

245
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:08,967
Rym: However, I'll note that the of the eight games that came out You can see a very definite progression in how well the Wi-Fi is utilized.

246
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,776
Rym: that is Mario Kart.

247
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:15,630
Rym: Mario Kart used it well enough for me But it was by no means a finished product.

248
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,657
Scott: Tetris was the one that really used a proper.

249
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:25,480
Rym: every game that's come out has used it better and better and better and the DS hasn't even begun its full potential lifecycle yet.

250
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,627
Scott: There's gonna be some hardcore Wi-Fi action in the future.

251
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:32,639
Rym: I Mean a lot of games have come for the DS already.

252
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,173
Rym: if the DS died now, I consider all the money I've spent on it.

253
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:36,836
Rym: Well worth it.

254
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:37,680
Scott: Absolutely.

255
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,670
Rym: The DS is still on a rising tide.

256
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:51,320
Scott: Yes is nowhere near peaking and just so everyone knows it is very likely in the near future that black and Pinkish colored DS lights will be hitting the US.

257
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:53,989
Scott: Oh, man's I might get that black one.

258
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,594
Rym: I don't know I might get the black one.

259
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:57,401
Rym: I thought I was gonna say pink.

260
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:57,963
Scott: No.

261
00:17:58,304 --> 00:17:59,870
Scott: No, I was pretty sure you're gonna say black.

262
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,191
Rym: Why?

263
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,054
Rym: cuz I have a pink towel.

264
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:04,205
Scott: I just want you figure you wanted to match your iPod nano.

265
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,101
Rym: Oh Yeah, I don't want to match my iPod nano and so do I.

266
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,170
Scott: I have also a black iPod nano.

267
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:14,770
Rym: Yeah, but unfortunately for you the DS light does not come in the color scratch to fuck.

268
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:17,341
Rym: I don't know how you did that to your dana.

269
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:18,970
Scott: my you know, it still works just fine.

270
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,264
Rym: So I don't give a shit what my nano has not a single scratch on the black.

271
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:24,789
Scott: yours came with that little sleeve.

272
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,016
Rym: now It's not just a sleeve.

273
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:28,009
Rym: you realize that the inside of it is a polishing cloth.

274
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,430
Rym: Polishes it every time I put it in you'll see I don't have that.

275
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,759
Rym: So the back is so unscratched.

276
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:34,723
Rym: I can use it as a mirror.

277
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:36,590
Scott: I can use the back of mine as a mirror.

278
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:40,101
Scott: Yeah, if you want to see scratches, no, you get it actually works pretty good.

279
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:41,265
Rym: You mean pretty well.

280
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:42,690
Scott: No, it does because deeds.

281
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:43,552
Rym: No, it doesn't.

282
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,919
Scott: it doesn't and besides we see myself.

283
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:46,661
Scott: That's a good you didn't?

284
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:47,844
Rym: you didn't use the verb.

285
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:49,950
Rym: do you use the verb work?

286
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,055
Rym: So it works good.

287
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:57,810
Rym: That would mean if you to use that sentence properly My face in it is doing work.

288
00:18:57,912 --> 00:18:58,508
Scott: That's his job.

289
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,065
Rym: No work in that sense would have to mean working as an iron working as in.

290
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:05,649
Rym: you took good as your medium And you worked it somehow.

291
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,281
Rym: Alright, alright, we're getting kind of silly and off-topic today, but you know what.

292
00:19:15,683 --> 00:19:17,289
Rym: every episode can't be a jam here.

293
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:25,369
Scott: No, I mean if you want us to make for a week And I don't think anyone is telling us not to make in fact you all told us to make more.

294
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:30,850
Scott: Yeah, so if you want us to keep doing this you're gonna have to settle with a few episodes being kind of kooky.

295
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:34,810
Rym: Now with that aside it is in fact time for things of the day.

296
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:39,710
Rym: So I think we're going to do the things of the day right now and try to stay a little bit on topic.

297
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:51,235
Scott: Well, my thing of the day is actually a thing of yesteryear and it's I'm not talking about You know the usual classic things of the day which were things that would have been things of the day Maybe five years ago.

298
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:55,570
Scott: I'm talking about something that was on TV in 1993.

299
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:07,686
Scott: Okay, this is OJ Simpson the juice Playing NBC's computer bowl 93 against Iron Mike Ditka.

300
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:08,468
Rym: Wait a minute.

301
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:08,970
Rym: Wait a minute.

302
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:14,810
Rym: Is this being rebroadcast with implied oral consent but not express written consent?

303
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,938
Scott: This doesn't even have implied oral consent.

304
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:19,804
Scott: That is why this is so awesome.

305
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:29,509
Scott: All right, because they see This is like during the halftime show of an actual NFL football game, which means it is completely owned by the NFL.

306
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,835
Scott: yet Someone recorded it.

307
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:35,690
Scott: Someone kept that recording until today and then someone put it on YouTube.

308
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,299
Rym: Thank You Internet for providing endless entertainment.

309
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:39,620
Rym: Yes,

310
00:20:39,961 --> 00:21:00,050
Scott: so this is not only awesome because it is OJ Simpson and Iron Mike Ditka playing a very old Sega Genesis football game against each other But it is also awesome Because you know, you're really really really really really not allowed to put any video footage that belongs to the NFL on the internet.

311
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:02,460
Scott: So it's a double whammy thing of the day.

312
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,866
Scott: Funny for two reasons.

313
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:04,770
Rym: That is utterly fantastic.

314
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:06,737
Scott: And OJ Simpson.

315
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,044
Rym: OJ Simpson.

316
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:10,835
Scott: Playing a Sega Genesis All right.

317
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:15,198
Rym: Anyway, my thing of the day Was actually on the forums.

318
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:18,630
Rym: So one mad props to glimpse seven for pointing this out to us.

319
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:24,419
Rym: I'll give him props because it's one of the few things that has hit the forums That was actually good enough to where.

320
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,690
Rym: yeah, this will be a thing of the day and we hadn't seen it yet.

321
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:33,160
Rym: So also if you don't visit the forums realize that you often will get a content ahead of everyone else.

322
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:40,310
Rym: I mean we've had what actually we just recently passed like a hundred thousand hits or something stupid to the forums.

323
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:41,889
Scott: I don't even pay attention to that shit.

324
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:46,730
Rym: Yeah, I was there because I googled for something and I was curious why we came up and I was looking around anyway.

325
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:53,630
Rym: This is one of those YouTube videos for someone somewhat surreptitiously film someone else and then edits it together for clarity.

326
00:21:54,252 --> 00:22:10,509
Rym: Now this guy is a roommate or a friend or something who plays counter-strike a little too seriously and you know when you play it seems like a lot of other people get angry with you when you shoot them or They swear at you or obviously or in some way perturbed by how good you are.

327
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:17,469
Rym: This is what those guys look like and what they're doing behind their computer while you shoot them.

328
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,276
Rym: It is utterly hilarious.

329
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:23,727
Rym: And while I wanted a different thing of the day, but I can't find it anymore.

330
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:24,690
Rym: That is similar.

331
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:30,980
Rym: This is very much worth watching because it's not just clips of the guy swearing and yelling and screaming and freaking out Oh, it's so much more.

332
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:35,769
Rym: it is also Remixes of him yelling and screaming and all of this.

333
00:22:36,171 --> 00:22:43,573
Scott: Yeah, like at one point the guy says bink bink and he like blinks his hands in the air kind of and then they you Know at a couple other times.

334
00:22:43,593 --> 00:22:45,098
Scott: He's like, oh, yeah.

335
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:48,488
Scott: Oh, so the guy remixes it to be like, oh bink bink.

336
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:50,437
Scott: Yeah Oh bink bink.

337
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:54,191
Scott: Yeah, fuck fuck fuck fuck bink bibbing Exactly.

338
00:22:54,654 --> 00:22:57,590
Rym: Now there was one that I'm not linking to because I don't know where it is.

339
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,130
Rym: I think I found it on file planet, but you know what fuck file planet.

340
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,397
Rym: That's the only place I can get it.

341
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:05,670
Rym: I'm not getting it exactly but way back.

342
00:23:05,911 --> 00:23:18,039
Rym: I don't remember this was at RIT or if we just found it at RIT But it sounds like the kind of thing that would come out of RIT Where a guy had a neighbor or roommate who played Counter-Strike way Way too seriously.

343
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,124
Scott: Sounds like RIT to me.

344
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:36,303
Rym: So he would Record this guy yelling and playing Counter-Strike and then he made a techno song comprised mostly of loops of this guy's yelling And it was absolutely Hilarious if someone wants to find it and even other people.

345
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:41,608
Rym: and there were eight people gaga Inside Joe Kim.

346
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:57,045
Rym: Yeah, so the only inside joke that we can't reveal because we don't have the material Yeah Suffice to say someday there is going to be audio on GeekNights from what is perhaps one of the most Inside internet jokes in the world.

347
00:23:57,126 --> 00:24:06,948
Rym: It is known only To the front row crew a few of our close friends and The people who played mega TF in the late 90s.

348
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:14,972
Scott: No, not just the people who played it the people who played it hardcore people who were in the clans the people who knew a guy Moog.

349
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:15,995
Rym: Yeah good.

350
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:18,543
Scott: Yeah, and of course moog himself.

351
00:24:18,864 --> 00:24:20,268
Rym: Yes, if he's still alive.

352
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:23,395
Rym: Yep All right I should try to track him down.

353
00:24:23,757 --> 00:24:25,563
Scott: find the moog find the move.

354
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,867
Scott: get the moog on the show.

355
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:27,770
Rym: interview the moog.

356
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,091
Rym: Be like.

357
00:24:28,111 --> 00:24:28,995
Rym: do you remember this?

358
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:31,225
Rym: He's like, I'm a highly-played business professional.

359
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:32,370
Rym: What the hell is going on?

360
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:41,170
Rym: Yeah, so today we decided because Scott just bought it and we played it three times.

361
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,789
Scott: I think I played it four times four times four times.

362
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:48,110
Rym: We have a game called Ra now not a Mon Ray but Ra.

363
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:49,998
Scott: Yeah, just plain old Ra.

364
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:51,445
Scott: now on board game geek.

365
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:52,610
Scott: There are two Ra's.

366
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,080
Scott: There's a very old Ra and a very new Ra.

367
00:24:55,462 --> 00:25:03,830
Scott: it is the newer of the two Ra Yep, and it is a game by Rainer Kenizia who is famed for being awesome.

368
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:10,570
Scott: He is makes the many many good games and also many many not as good games, but still kind of good games.

369
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,670
Scott: He is a great great game designer.

370
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:21,288
Rym: Now Ra is a bidding game But it's not like every other bidding game that the bidding is not needly.

371
00:25:21,368 --> 00:25:26,969
Rym: It's not seven eight Eleven twelve fourteen fifteen.

372
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:29,616
Scott: Yeah It's here is the thing to bid on.

373
00:25:30,018 --> 00:25:33,588
Scott: you have four sons and their sons are numbered one through.

374
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:39,145
Scott: it depends How many people are playing but if they're full set of people playing they're one through sixteen.

375
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:48,376
Scott: Yeah, one through sixteen and depending on the number of players you have three or four sons at your disposal and You pretty much get one chance to bid.

376
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:52,570
Scott: it goes around the table once and you either bid or pass and that's it.

377
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:57,370
Scott: So let's say the bidding starts at the Rym and he bids his he doesn't decides not to bid.

378
00:25:57,851 --> 00:26:03,670
Scott: Then I bid my son that has the number five on it and then someone else bids the son that has the number seven.

379
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,212
Scott: Oh, I'm done.

380
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:08,207
Scott: I can't you know decide again to bring out my eight son or anything.

381
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:08,628
Scott: That's it.

382
00:26:09,424 --> 00:26:15,269
Rym: Yep Now that way the way the sons are balanced is that the way they're passed out and that this is determined by the rule book.

383
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:16,552
Rym: Everyone.

384
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:17,335
Rym: it's really balanced.

385
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:22,032
Rym: We're like one person will have one son that's higher than everyone else's Other.

386
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:29,990
Rym: three sons are kind of low and then like everyone can kind of trump everyone else Kinda and it seems really balanced and well put together in that regard.

387
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:34,584
Scott: Yeah, and the each son is unique like there aren't two of the same numbered son.

388
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:36,330
Scott: So there's no chance of a tie.

389
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:46,890
Rym: Yeah Now the other mechanic is that when you use a son you give it up it goes in the middle of the board and then You take back whatever son was currently in the middle of the board and put it back in front of you.

390
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,573
Rym: But face down you can't use it for the rest of the round Once.

391
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:54,807
Rym: but you basically anytime you use a son you get whatever son was out there.

392
00:26:54,948 --> 00:27:01,970
Scott: if you win the bidding Yeah, so the game starts off with the number one, which is the lowest son out in the middle of the board.

393
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,549
Scott: So whoever is the first to you know bid and win?

394
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,490
Scott: Puts out whatever they bid with out to the middle of the board and gets the number one son.

395
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:15,424
Scott: And when you do that you get that you get the son from the middle of the board.

396
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:19,640
Scott: you put it face down Which means you can't use it again in this epoch.

397
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:22,310
Scott: and then there are three epochs in the game.

398
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:29,886
Scott: you basically play the game three times and you score, you know, you score some stuff each epoch and you score some stuff at the end of the game.

399
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:35,330
Scott: and You know each epoch you flip over your face down sons.

400
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:38,480
Scott: So if it's a three player game, you can only bid.

401
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:41,710
Scott: you can only win four bids and then you're all out of sons.

402
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:42,658
Scott: That's it.

403
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:43,969
Scott: You're done for the rest of the epoch.

404
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:47,240
Rym: Now the way the game plays is very very simple.

405
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,246
Rym: on your turn there's a god card.

406
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:49,788
Rym: forget about that.

407
00:27:49,828 --> 00:27:56,889
Rym: you can either draw a random tile from the bag and stick it on the auction cart meaning that that tile goes up for auction.

408
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,530
Rym: or You can call rah, which means we have a bidding round immediately.

409
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:02,252
Scott: Yep.

410
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:08,030
Scott: Now there is also a chance that when you take a tile it's a raw tile, which means up we call rah.

411
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,085
Rym: Anyway now in addition the raw tiles.

412
00:28:11,205 --> 00:28:22,810
Rym: every time one's drawn It goes on the top of the board and there's a number of slots and an epoch ends Immediately with no bidding when the last raw tile fills that top and there are a lot of raw tiles.

413
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,089
Scott: Yeah, so 30 raw tiles in the bag.

414
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:27,568
Rym: So basically it'll come down to you know.

415
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:32,070
Rym: Say there's two spaces left up there and people are drawing and then someone draws a raw.

416
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:40,009
Rym: Now if any other rahs are drawn the epoch is immediately over There is no more bidding and that's the end.

417
00:28:40,513 --> 00:28:54,410
Rym: So people who still have face-up Suns are Really kind of screwed at that point because they either have to hope that a raw doesn't come up Bid real quick and win to get something before the epoch ends or you know not have put themselves in that situation.

418
00:28:54,410 --> 00:29:01,096
Scott: Yeah, generally what you're bidding on are all these different tiles not gonna go into the different tiles But some of them stay around.

419
00:29:01,297 --> 00:29:06,352
Scott: some of them disappear each epoch and some of them if you don't have enough of them you lose Points.

420
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:09,290
Scott: some of them only get you points at the end of the game.

421
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:15,110
Scott: You're just trying to get a lots of tiles and the more tiles you have generally the more points you get.

422
00:29:15,532 --> 00:29:17,949
Scott: But you know certain tiles give more points to certain people.

423
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:24,750
Rym: Yeah, and I really that's pretty much the entire game other than you know, the specific rules and tiny little things about it.

424
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:26,436
Rym: There's really not much to it.

425
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:30,169
Rym: You make very few decisions during the game, but the game's still a lot of fun.

426
00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:33,258
Scott: Yeah, the game was definitely like usually.

427
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:37,770
Scott: bidding games aren't way fun like Pizarro was literally.

428
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:41,642
Rym: Everyone bids on a finite set of things and then you count up your points.

429
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:43,608
Scott: Yeah, this was nothing.

430
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:44,892
Scott: that game What's?

431
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:45,132
Scott: what's?

432
00:29:45,193 --> 00:29:47,659
Scott: another exam Tower of Babel was a bidding game.

433
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,063
Rym: God Tower of Babel.

434
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:49,404
Rym: Yeah.

435
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:50,326
Rym: I'm sorry Pete.

436
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:50,808
Rym: I'm sorry.

437
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:51,570
Rym: You bought that game.

438
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:55,268
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why you got to look games up on board game geek before you buy it.

439
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:07,210
Rym: seriously, yeah, but I mean, I guess the the thing that I thought was both cool and that I have a problem with with raw I mean, we haven't played it enough to be able to fully analyze.

440
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:08,729
Scott: I mean we played it four times.

441
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:22,850
Rym: I have not come close to figuring out everything there is to know about but I know that of the four games everyone pretty much went the same way and Your choices are basically take the most statistically likely chance to win.

442
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:32,670
Rym: I mean think of it like a horse race You can bet on the two to one horse where you're very likely to win But you won't get as many points like you'll win and just generically.

443
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:37,470
Rym: But you can also bet on the ten to one horse and you're less likely to win.

444
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:40,249
Rym: But if your boat comes in you super win.

445
00:30:40,723 --> 00:30:50,770
Rym: Yeah And this game is like that in the center so far in the sense that there's the obvious safe Conservative strategy and there's the very risky.

446
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,609
Rym: But if the car the tiles come up right you'll win by so much that no one can even come close to you.

447
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:57,489
Scott: Yeah, that's it seemed to happen.

448
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:07,853
Scott: I mean the one person would you know really get on a roll and get lots of tiles And the other people would sort of not be able to stop the momentum, you know It's like that

449
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:10,328
Rym: might be a consequence of playing the three-player version -

450
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:13,127
Scott: I do I really do want to play this a lot more people like.

451
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:17,248
Scott: at first I thought the game wouldn't be so different when you change the number of players.

452
00:31:17,449 --> 00:31:20,527
Scott: now I'm really seeing that the four and five players where it's at.

453
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:23,129
Rym: Yes I mean, I like the game and it's very fun.

454
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:33,118
Rym: But at least in the three-player version in the four games we've played it very much seems that once everyone knows what they're doing The game really just comes down to playing the odds.

455
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:34,702
Rym: it's really no different than playing roulette.

456
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:49,439
Scott: Yeah, it does sort of seem like You know, like I can see how luck is a big factor, you know But it doesn't quite feel like it's a total random game, you know It feels like there's something else going on.

457
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,510
Scott: that is you know skill and decision-based.

458
00:31:52,711 --> 00:32:23,229
Rym: We had an argument like this before the show and I disagree with Scott very strongly and Alex disagrees to a Somewhat lesser extent than me but he still disagrees with Scott in the sense that the game really comes down to just an odds game and all you the only decisions you make are you look and you can say By doing this and following this basic strategy and going for these tiles and calling her out these times I will have a X percentage chance of getting Y points or I can have a lower Z percentage chance of getting a higher end points.

459
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:26,610
Rym: Hmm and that's really the only decision.

460
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,882
Rym: It's just do I go with the conservative strategy?

461
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:34,970
Rym: that'll win 60% of the time Unless anyone else goes for the non conservative one, or do I go for the non conservative one?

462
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,869
Rym: But then I'm totally leaving my victory up to what tiles come up.

463
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:42,550
Scott: See, I think that is sort of true unless you know.

464
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:48,106
Scott: It's sort of like blackjack where that it's true that you're playing odds unless you count the cards.

465
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:48,869
Scott: and it's not.

466
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:52,343
Rym: but everyone Counts the cards and everyone knows exactly what to do.

467
00:32:52,544 --> 00:32:54,050
Rym: Everyone knows what's going on.

468
00:32:55,232 --> 00:32:58,327
Rym: The game is the game is perfect information, you know everything.

469
00:32:58,347 --> 00:33:01,276
Scott: no Unless you it's all of its play.

470
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:07,270
Scott: It's significant memory factor in remembering what tiles were out and got discarded face down in the box.

471
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:11,009
Rym: Yeah, except you realize counting cards in blackjack, you know how it actually works.

472
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:13,900
Scott: Yeah, you figure out the likelihood of the 10.

473
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,201
Rym: Oh, no.

474
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:14,763
Rym: No.

475
00:33:14,804 --> 00:33:15,667
Rym: No, no, do you know the?

476
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:16,290
Rym: there's a system?

477
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,950
Rym: You know how counting cards means there's a count, you know how to do it.

478
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,223
Scott: Well generally like whenever you see certain cards the number goes up.

479
00:33:23,283 --> 00:33:25,010
Scott: when you see other cards the number goes down.

480
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,670
Scott: Yeah, and that way, you know, if the number is high that means the likelihood of tens coming out.

481
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,394
Rym: Here's the thing.

482
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:35,861
Rym: You don't need to remember all the cards You just need to remember trends and this game is the same way.

483
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:43,926
Rym: all the only cards you need to count in this game are the Roz and Then all that does is give you a percentage to where.

484
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:48,450
Rym: now, you know The exact odds of what you're whether or not your strategy is going to succeed.

485
00:33:48,571 --> 00:34:02,270
Scott: I think the Roz are definitely the most important thing to count but it's also I think important to count other things like I was counting the Pharaohs in the game because I was short on Pharaohs and I need you know, I was wondering how many more of them would come out.

486
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,073
Scott: It didn't matter.

487
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:07,370
Scott: it did matter because if there weren't any more Pharaohs coming it would have been worth it.

488
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:09,007
Rym: No You know why it doesn't matter?

489
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:14,829
Rym: Because there are so many more tiles in the bag than will ever come into play in the game.

490
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:28,536
Rym: Yeah, therefore regardless of the odds the odds basically even out to where it doesn't matter and Unless there's a crazy run on one particular kind of tile That kind of count isn't?

491
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:29,600
Rym: it really isn't gonna matter.

492
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,929
Rym: The odds are that whatever you need isn't gonna come up anyway.

493
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:35,944
Scott: No, the odds are that it depending on what it is.

494
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:51,210
Rym: It may or may not come up But what happens when there's so many tiles is that the odds end up being effectively insignificant because the odds of one thing happening versus another thing are Virtually indistinguishable unless a crazy amount of one car has come up.

495
00:34:54,096 --> 00:35:00,926
Scott: Not really Because I know how many Pharaohs start and I know how I see how many Pharaohs have already come.

496
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:12,770
Scott: and thus if I need Pharaohs I can say okay the odds of getting Pharaohs now or less or more Yeah, but that doesn't matter for your strategy because Pharaohs coming up is not really something you can control.

497
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:18,184
Scott: well, yeah, it is because if there's let's say there there's a chance to get one Pharaoh.

498
00:35:18,244 --> 00:35:23,729
Scott: now and I only have one Sun left and You know, it's better to have one Pharaoh than zero.

499
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:29,761
Scott: But no if there's a lot of Pharaohs still in that bag Um, I might hold out wait to get two Pharaohs.

500
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:32,290
Rym: you you apply this to the most recent game we played right?

501
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:39,746
Rym: Yep, when you applied that because I remember you said it very specifically the fair you getting Pharaohs wouldn't have any effect on the game anyway.

502
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:50,369
Rym: Well, that's because I won by more even if I didn't get When you brought this up the Pharaohs wouldn't have mattered anyway because you needed so many more Pharaohs for it to affect you at all.

503
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:54,129
Scott: It would have helped and it did in the end, but not so much.

504
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:57,190
Scott: The point is I would have won even if I didn't have the Pharaohs ever.

505
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,776
Scott: Yeah, I guess it was still a way to get.

506
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:08,284
Rym: my main gripe was the game is that I make the same decisions when I win and when I lose and It really just seems to come down to how many rods come up and when.

507
00:36:08,304 --> 00:36:18,160
Scott: oh see I made the first I won the first time he played and the most recent time he played and I made very similar decisions both of those Times and the second and third times he played.

508
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:24,990
Scott: I just kind of played casually, you know Just trying stuff out to see what worked, you know calling rod different times, you know.

509
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:33,250
Scott: and but you're really only in the most recent time did I have an idea of what I wanted to do and I was thinking About when to call Ra and yeah thinking I was doing it.

510
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:38,450
Rym: But here's the problem when you were thinking that Alex and I were thinking the exact same thing.

511
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:39,453
Scott: Yeah,

512
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:41,544
Rym: we knew exactly what to do and but

513
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:42,569
Scott: obviously didn't work

514
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:57,910
Rym: because we knew exactly what to do for every player and Doing the optimal thing for you automatically because the turn order and the cards that were up at that time Prevented us from doing anything because the most optimal move we could make was draw a tile and hope it's a Ra.

515
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:02,539
Rym: Oh Yeah, I'm quite sure and Alex agrees with me.

516
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,843
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

517
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:05,710
Scott: I don't think we're quite experts on this game.

518
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:11,570
Rym: Oh, no, I just definitely feel that there's a lot more randomness to this game that you seem to understand.

519
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:13,350
Scott: Oh, no, that is randomness.

520
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:21,649
Scott: You mean someone could just come up and you know draw exactly the tiles they want and you know If it happens, then they're gonna get a whole bajillion points.

521
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:28,650
Rym: It feels like the randomness really overshadows the strategy and that there is really isn't much strategy either.

522
00:37:28,731 --> 00:37:30,570
Rym: It's just playing the odds and counting.

523
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:39,459
Scott: I don't think it overshadows the strategy because if you don't know what you're doing and you don't have the strategy down and you don't Play correctly no matter what tiles come up.

524
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:41,145
Scott: You're gonna lose to someone who knows that they're doing.

525
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:50,724
Rym: but then again It's just knowing the odds because then your your only strategic decisions are Do I take the safe lower payout or the more risky higher payout?

526
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:52,189
Rym: Those are the only decisions you make.

527
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,557
Scott: Mmm, I don't know.

528
00:37:54,577 --> 00:37:56,105
Scott: I think this you can also.

529
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:57,170
Scott: you know as time it's.

530
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,310
Scott: It's not so direct, you know, it changes over time.

531
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:12,050
Rym: But it is because when the the things you were talking about, you know The things the factors you were considering and the things you were thinking about the things you were counting We were both counting the exact same things and we knew exactly what the optimal move was.

532
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:16,785
Rym: The problem is we also saw that you were in the position to make the optimal move.

533
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:18,170
Rym: that stops us every time.

534
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:21,481
Scott: I think there's maybe a move that it was not not.

535
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:30,150
Rym: as that case if you have your sons and You have Ra and then now that means Alex and I both have to draw a tile or call Ra.

536
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:36,753
Rym: Alex is not going to call Ra because there are no tiles out and neither one of us will bid and he'll be forced to Waste his son on nothing.

537
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:49,230
Rym: I Me calling Ra is most likely going to force me to bite that stupid tile for one of my sons.

538
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,155
Rym: You it gets to your turn now.

539
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,000
Rym: There are two sun two tiles out.

540
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:56,850
Rym: two tiles is the magic number especially when you have low-numbered sons.

541
00:38:57,971 --> 00:38:58,653
Scott: Hmm, I guess.

542
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:04,370
Rym: but because remember the time I won I won mostly by go doing which exactly what you did.

543
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:18,954
Rym: I got to the point where I had a bunch of sons and I had Ra so I'd let it go around and I would Every single time it got to me because the two tiles we seemed especially optimal because people would either give me what I wanted or They'd give up their sons.

544
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:26,430
Scott: see but by that logic, you know, eventually someone drew a Ra tile or yeah Eventually, I would take a tile and put it out there.

545
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,545
Scott: How come when you didn't then at that point in the game because it didn't happen.

546
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:31,910
Scott: it happened many times.

547
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:38,370
Rym: No, because by the time it happened then it was a totally different strategic area and calling Ra was bad for another reason.

548
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:43,280
Scott: hmm, I Think there's just something that's being overlooked here.

549
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,910
Rym: No, I think there's just so much randomness in the game.

550
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,354
Rym: It might be mitigated by having more players I doubt.

551
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:50,145
Scott: yeah more players definitely help out.

552
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:55,250
Scott: because think about that You know one guy draws a tile the second guy draws a tile the third guy calls Ra.

553
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:57,679
Scott: You have these fourth and fifth guys sitting there going.

554
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:00,550
Scott: Uh, who didn't draw a tile or call Ra but can bid?

555
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:03,368
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that would definitely throw things off.

556
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:14,207
Rym: Plus just the fact that the Ra tiles have so much influence in the game and whatever your strategy is The end result is how effective it'll be almost always comes down to the Ra's.

557
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:26,750
Rym: because if you play conservatively and normally like the straight-up way we've seen Then if the Ra's come out too slowly or too quickly You're fucked and people who bet on the Ra's coming out slowly or quickly just win by crazy leaps and bounds.

558
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:43,770
Scott: Yeah It does seem like if you play if you don't bid and you keep your sons and the Ra's come out very slowly Then other people are kind of forced to bid and they will buy things and then run out of sons And then you win because now you can deal out a whole bunch of tiles and take them all for yourself.

559
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:51,030
Scott: But if the Ra's come out quickly Then you need to spend your sons quickly so you can get stuff before the Ra's finish.

560
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:58,750
Rym: So I guess just so far the game feels to me like a slot machine of Ra's and everything else is just incidental.

561
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:01,662
Rym: Mmm, that's the feeling I get I still like the game.

562
00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:03,170
Scott: It feels a little different than that to me.

563
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,522
Scott: I mean, I'm not gonna say this game doesn't have mad luck factor.

564
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:08,790
Scott: It has a significant horrendous luck factor.

565
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,805
Scott: I just do not think the luck factor is the number one dominant factor.

566
00:41:12,825 --> 00:41:14,170
Scott: I would say is the number two factor.

567
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:17,668
Rym: I think it's the number one factor when players are playing intelligently.

568
00:41:19,091 --> 00:41:21,058
Scott: Maybe but I'm I would I would agree.

569
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:26,440
Scott: I would agree with that if I was confident that we Consider this way.

570
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:27,969
Rym: the odds are known.

571
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:35,571
Rym: Unless you have a shitty memory and you can't count the tiles that have come up the odds of anything happening are fully known to Everyone.

572
00:41:36,013 --> 00:41:38,400
Rym: everyone knows the odds of anything coming up.

573
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:45,549
Rym: Everyone knows that the chances of any strategy has of succeeding Yeah, and everyone knows everyone else is bidding power.

574
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:50,860
Rym: So everyone is making the best decision they can make unless they are stupid.

575
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,969
Rym: Therefore what's the only other factor in the game?

576
00:41:56,112 --> 00:41:58,689
Scott: See but I don't believe that everyone is making the best decision.

577
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:00,695
Scott: I Mean we have.

578
00:42:00,715 --> 00:42:02,090
Scott: we've only played the game for time.

579
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,298
Scott: Yeah, we saw not gonna be convinced that we were making.

580
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:05,081
Rym: there might be times.

581
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:11,862
Rym: We are not making the optimal decisions right now However, the moment we have players that foot that understand the game well enough.

582
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:14,850
Rym: the game becomes completely random, which is true of many games.

583
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:21,383
Rym: I just feel like it's going to come much quicker in this game or This game is going to become nothing but a memory slash risk-taking game.

584
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:23,589
Scott: Maybe so maybe so.

585
00:42:24,431 --> 00:42:28,564
Scott: Anyway, it is the seventh highest ranked game on board game geek.

586
00:42:28,805 --> 00:42:30,350
Rym: Well, I can see why the game's really fun.

587
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:37,937
Rym: Yeah, I just I feel like I felt absolutely no satisfaction when I won and I felt absolutely no Apprehension when I lost like.

588
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:40,030
Rym: I didn't think ah, I could have done better.

589
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,780
Rym: I thought yeah, that's how it turned out.

590
00:42:41,821 --> 00:42:43,390
Rym: and when I won I thought the exact same thing.

591
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,201
Rym: I don't feel any different when I win or lose.

592
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:46,590
Rym: I just enjoy playing the game.

593
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:50,530
Scott: See the first time when I won I was like, okay the game we'd ever played before I won.

594
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,313
Scott: That was random.

595
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:58,012
Scott: But the second and third the second time I was like, okay I lost by a little bit and I kind of was like, yeah Whatever.

596
00:42:58,032 --> 00:43:02,250
Scott: the third time I was like when I got completely hosed that I had no points.

597
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:08,776
Scott: I was like you had three points three points, which is less than I started with and I was like, okay I did something stupid.

598
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,023
Scott: What did I do?

599
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:11,250
Rym: stupid now?

600
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:17,109
Scott: See and the most recent time when I just won by a landslide I really felt like I did some smart moves.

601
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,260
Rym: But in the game that you lost you didn't really do anything stupid.

602
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:26,286
Rym: from what I could remember so much as I did to you The exact thing that you did to me in the game.

603
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:26,950
Rym: We just played.

604
00:43:27,611 --> 00:43:29,921
Scott: Yeah, but in the game we just played when I did it to you.

605
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:31,730
Scott: You didn't end up with three points.

606
00:43:32,232 --> 00:43:35,950
Rym: Well, yeah, that's because I got really really lucky in the second epoch.

607
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:37,956
Rym: maybe it was because I didn't.

608
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:41,407
Rym: I was totally not doing well at all and I was losing by a lot.

609
00:43:41,789 --> 00:44:01,129
Rym: and then in the second epoch Through pretty much randomness I happen to have the the position in place to get a whole bunch of points all of a sudden from a bunch of gold because there happened to be a tile out there that you weren't gonna take as it was gonna destroy your Civilizations and Alex wasn't gonna take because he had already spent too many of his sons.

610
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:04,389
Scott: Mmm, yeah those disasters do kind of throw things us.

611
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:14,125
Rym: It was a set of tiles that neither you nor Alex wanted and that happened to be Super super super points for me just because of the random money or the random stuff.

612
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:15,350
Rym: I happen to have not the monuments.

613
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:24,149
Rym: Yeah, I guess so I would have done really really terribly in the last game like more so than I did except for the random good luck I had in the second epoch.

614
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:38,750
Scott: Also, I think that From what I've been reading around about this game in the lower player games There seems to be a more significant factor of screw the other guy and when there's more players that becomes much less of a factor.

615
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,470
Rym: Yeah, I definitely want to play the game with more players.

616
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:51,094
Scott: Yeah, I mean in the three-player game you can basically see you know Let's say I'm ahead by a bunch and there's one Pharaoh left and I know that without a Pharaoh Rym We'll lose five points.

617
00:44:51,234 --> 00:44:53,964
Scott: I could just buy that Pharaoh and not care to screw him.

618
00:44:54,366 --> 00:44:55,450
Scott: and a five-player game.

619
00:44:55,591 --> 00:45:03,250
Scott: that's like a really really bad idea because you only have three sons and not four sons and There's no way you're gonna get that kind of a lead in a five-player game.

620
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,483
Scott: I don't think even though I've never played a five-player game.

621
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:06,550
Scott: I've only played it three player.

622
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:15,569
Rym: I'm just making stuff up at this point Yep, so basically that just means that we're gonna do another episode on raw once we've played it I don't know 40 more times.

623
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:21,408
Scott: I think maybe we'll do like a half episode on raw and a half episode on something else as we get more experience with it.

624
00:45:22,071 --> 00:45:32,870
Rym: It depends if if I'm right in that there's not much to raw once you figure it out We'll do a half episode if we discover the magic hidden awesome that I'm somewhat dubious of its existence.

625
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,476
Scott: Yeah, let me just I want to read the.

626
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:36,543
Scott: I just I've never actually looked at this recently.

627
00:45:36,624 --> 00:45:38,758
Scott: the top 10 ranked board games and board game.

628
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:38,963
Scott: geek.

629
00:45:39,912 --> 00:45:41,790
Rym: I'll know that doom was up there for a while.

630
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,981
Scott: No, these are like the ranked like all-time voting and all that stuff.

631
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:45,844
Scott: not just pop those.

632
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:49,433
Scott: that's like the popular list of what's hot now Ranking, right?

633
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,920
Scott: So Puerto Rico's number one best game ever.

634
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,746
Rym: Tigris and Euphrates second best game.

635
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:58,983
Scott: a list pretty much Yeah power grid, which you never played but it's sort of like web of power.

636
00:45:59,023 --> 00:45:59,465
Rym: I like web.

637
00:45:59,525 --> 00:46:00,970
Rym: I heard El Grande.

638
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:03,790
Scott: I have El Grande princes of Florence.

639
00:46:04,993 --> 00:46:05,960
Rym: That's the first one on the list.

640
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,584
Rym: We haven't played.

641
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:11,981
Scott: Yeah, rah ageist eem Daimacher and number 10 is war the ring.

642
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:12,946
Rym: Uh-huh.

643
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:20,390
Scott: So Yeah, a lot of those other games that are up there seem to be significant strategy games.

644
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:24,490
Scott: I mean El Grande yet not a hundred percent like the top three games.

645
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:27,560
Rym: Well, remember we never played the other variant of El Grande.

646
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,362
Scott: That's true.

647
00:46:28,543 --> 00:46:30,409
Scott: That's all that's very true, which I have.

648
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:37,972
Scott: Yep But you know, this is a game raw that you know, we think is a significant luck game You know.

649
00:46:38,093 --> 00:46:45,782
Scott: yet in a web site where strategy games are very popular Let me put it on a list where high strategy games are topping it.

650
00:46:45,862 --> 00:46:47,146
Scott: It is made number seven.

651
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:48,290
Rym: put it this way one.

652
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,359
Scott: I think there's something we're one.

653
00:46:50,701 --> 00:47:00,397
Rym: the box very clearly states that Fun is the biggest factor in the game and I'll say that even though I generally am so far Satisfied with the strategic elements of the game.

654
00:47:00,879 --> 00:47:02,062
Rym: It is very fun to play.

655
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:04,029
Rym: Yeah, enjoy playing it.

656
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:10,250
Rym: It's true - it's not so much straight-up luck as it's just all you're doing is playing the odds.

657
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:13,001
Rym: Mmm, it just.

658
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:13,789
Rym: it feels that way.

659
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:16,601
Rym: I mean there are elements of that in a lot of the games we like.

660
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:24,749
Rym: it just seems like that is the primary strategic element is Understanding the odds playing the odds knowing what other players have and wants.

661
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:29,016
Scott: Hmm Alright, I think that's about all we got to say.

662
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:33,128
Rym: Yep tune in tomorrow when we'll probably be somewhat more on topic.

663
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:36,016
Scott: Yep Tomorrow, what are we gonna talk about again?

664
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:38,465
Rym: Uh, we'll keep it a secret because we haven't decided yet.

665
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:39,730
Scott: Oh, okay, cool.

666
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:44,803
Rym: Yeah, and once again, you know frapper map forums website review us in iTunes.

667
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:45,886
Rym: yada yada yada.

668
00:47:46,006 --> 00:47:46,768
Scott: send us email.

669
00:47:46,788 --> 00:47:47,530
Scott: send us odios.

670
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:49,819
Rym: Yeah, send us odios.

671
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:55,370
Rym: and for all of you who've sent us email We're probably gonna do a geek back episode at some point in the future.

672
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,430
Scott: Yeah, we might have to do that is we're basically now.

673
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:02,342
Rym: We're only gonna do a geek back in a show if it's particularly relevant or awesome.

674
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:04,087
Rym: And otherwise, we'll save them for feedback shows.

675
00:48:04,408 --> 00:48:10,390
Scott: Yep Which means your email is less important, but still important enough to be read in an episode.

676
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:18,985
Rym: Well, we tend to respond to almost every email we get even though I gotta say if the trend of emails continues or increases That's probably not gonna happen anymore.

677
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:28,150
Rym: I'm sorry But I've had too many people emailing me asking For help with their podcast and while I love to help I'm basically writing essays to all of you.

678
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,257
Rym: I think I just need to make a little book and sell it.

679
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,745
Scott: I think that's a fantastic idea.

680
00:48:32,805 --> 00:48:34,150
Scott: make like a little tiny handbook.

681
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,501
Rym: You're like this is how to make a podcast go away.

682
00:48:36,662 --> 00:48:38,390
Scott: Well, no, I think we should go with that other idea.

683
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:48,010
Scott: We'll take a video of you know Rym screen when he does the Podcast post-production and all that jazz and that way you can all watch it and figure out what to do.

684
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:51,389
Scott: Yeah, we're actually and then we'll make a short YouTube of like what we have set up.

685
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,897
Rym: We're actually very much planning on doing that.

686
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:58,090
Rym: It's just a matter of one getting a better camera than the one we own.

687
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:03,630
Scott: Yeah, if anyone knows a good camcorders, we know absolutely nothing.

688
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:06,305
Rym: Why don't we just ask like Emily or Kate we will.

689
00:49:06,365 --> 00:49:09,529
Scott: but in addition, you know We might have a listener who's like it knows a lot about it.

690
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:16,182
Rym: So the thing is the camera we have now cost four thousand five hundred dollars in 1980 something.

691
00:49:16,485 --> 00:49:20,650
Scott: Yeah It's a VHS recording thing.

692
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:28,336
Scott: But no if anyone knows what's a really good camcorder something that will you know, we'll be able to make good youtubes We'll be able to make.

693
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:30,447
Rym: yeah, we're talking for less than like 600 bucks.

694
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:34,964
Scott: Yeah, you know something that can record video to some sort of.

695
00:49:35,024 --> 00:49:36,128
Scott: get it into our computer.

696
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:42,490
Rym: basically You know either into the Mac and well Scott you realize that we could just do about 10 minutes worth of research.

697
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,464
Scott: Yeah, but you know if someone out there might already be smart.

698
00:49:46,485 --> 00:49:47,409
Scott: We don't do any research.

699
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:48,495
Rym: Yeah Possibly so.

700
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:49,824
Scott: advice about camcorders.

701
00:49:49,965 --> 00:50:03,397
Rym: Yeah, send it to us but we will definitely in the future have the episodes and videos and everything of how we do GeekNights because I Know a lot of people who ask us for advice Don't seem to know a lot about it.

702
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,097
Rym: Yep, or the people who do know a lot about it Don't realize that they can do the same thing for a lot less money.

703
00:50:09,118 --> 00:50:12,688
Rym: Yep, and on that note we're out of here.

704
00:50:12,948 --> 00:50:23,447
Rym: Hooray And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
