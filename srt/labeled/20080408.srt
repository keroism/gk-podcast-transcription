1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,467
Rym: It's Tuesday April 8th.

2
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:12,390
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,618
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:19,160
Rym: tonight We talk about the new Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game for the DS.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,915
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:31,585
Scott: David Joe.

7
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:32,729
Scott: Dave hates advanced.

8
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:33,935
Rym: Why does Dave hate advanced?

9
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:34,879
Scott: because it's so hard.

10
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:36,947
Rym: It's not that hard if you're smart.

11
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:40,863
Scott: I know but on his latest show he was talking about he likes that He has.

12
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:47,939
Scott: there are more PSP games He likes than DS But he said it really depends on what kind of games you like and how he doesn't really do the advanced or so.

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:56,514
Rym: Well, I the thing is the advanced wars alone was enough for me to buy a DS Mm-hmm, but yeah, we didn't really have much to talk about.

14
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:58,040
Rym: nothing exciting happened today.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,975
Rym: Scott's train was weird and I was tired on the train.

16
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:03,340
Scott: I was real tired on the train.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,247
Scott: I need to eat fierce food.

18
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:06,131
Scott: Let's go get now.

19
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:06,653
Rym: Yeah.

20
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:08,460
Rym: Well, usually I'm the one who's like, hey, let's eat.

21
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:14,429
Rym: So here we go tides turn tables And the worst part right is.

22
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:20,800
Scott: I was gonna buy like a rye bread on the way home But I left all my cash at home and I didn't want to get out more cash.

23
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:25,480
Scott: Yeah, because I had so much on my desk because I took a later train.

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,571
Rym: So I had like a half hour to kill before I took it.

25
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:28,395
Rym: So I went.

26
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:29,360
Rym: I would try to buy a belt.

27
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:33,895
Rym: I learned that hmm hmm didn't have a belt in my size and I went and I got some samosa.

28
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:35,160
Scott: buying belts is really hard.

29
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,032
Scott: Yeah, I've had this belt I have.

30
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,156
Scott: it's like it's weird.

31
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:41,949
Scott: when I was in high school I had a belt that lasted like a hundred years.

32
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,000
Scott: Well, it felt like a hundred years, right?

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,540
Scott: Then I bought another one and it lasted a super long time.

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,209
Rym: I think part of it was when I was young.

35
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,340
Rym: I didn't really wear a belt ever.

36
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:51,105
Scott: I wore a belt.

37
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:54,928
Scott: I were on a belt like every with every Every day for a long time.

38
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,832
Rym: and what kind of?

39
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:57,680
Rym: because we grew up at the same time.

40
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:59,080
Rym: We were in the same grades and everything.

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,200
Rym: But when I was in like middle school and early high school the style of the times was everyone wore blue jeans.

42
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:06,507
Rym: Everyone wore like.

43
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:12,173
Rym: I wear a belt when I wear jeans like a black t-shirt Untucked and you don't need a belt if you're wearing on tux.

44
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:13,980
Scott: I have the belt under my untucked.

45
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,273
Rym: You don't need that unless your pants are way too big.

46
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,500
Scott: No, my pants aren't too big.

47
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,610
Scott: I wear the belt even if my pants stay on their own.

48
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:21,112
Scott: I don't know.

49
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,256
Scott: I just do plus.

50
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:23,560
Rym: it makes it extra little bald.

51
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:24,285
Rym: You don't want that.

52
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:26,160
Rym: and then you wear a flannel shirt over there.

53
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,565
Scott: Plus, I think it's also the belt.

54
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:29,594
Scott: you can hook things onto it, but I'd ever.

55
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,180
Rym: we didn't have cell phones back then.

56
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,413
Scott: What would you do it?

57
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:33,100
Scott: I had a cell phone.

58
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,299
Rym: Well, I had one but it was too big to hook to my belt.

59
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,299
Scott: No, well, yeah, you're talking about a little longer ago that I'm talking about middle school.

60
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,989
Scott: I'm talking about high school, but that the guardless.

61
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,634
Scott: I always wear a belt.

62
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:52,453
Scott: but recently my belts have been fault like But not because of stretching or fatness just because of like getting worn out of you know, putting them on taking them off But it's like the.

63
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:56,900
Scott: you know The mechanism on the belt breaks or you know the holes on the belt like sort of wear out.

64
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,851
Scott: Wow, they don't make belts like they used to.

65
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:00,300
Rym: I've never had a belt wear out.

66
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,180
Rym: I'm buying a new one solely because my current one is a little chipped on the buckle and it looks bad.

67
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:11,060
Scott: So I'm gonna buy a new one Perfectly functional the last belt I had wore out and this one's not doing too bad.

68
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:18,840
Rym: my other belt the only other belt I own other than my dress belt is The same one that I've worn since like sixth grade.

69
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:21,380
Scott: I think I'm just gonna get a rope because I think that'll do a lot better.

70
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,192
Rym: You know a lot of people use that as a style now

71
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:29,601
Scott: just like a climbing rope, you know Cuz that right now if I can never break it cost a lot, but I only need to get like, you know I

72
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,900
Rym: know you've been using that fancy new knot on your shoes.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,951
Rym: What kind of knot are you gonna use for your belt?

74
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,399
Rym: There's like a thousand options.

75
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:41,344
Scott: Oh, see, that's the thing is, you know people have different belt buckles Cowboy buckles.

76
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:43,740
Scott: that are really awesome, but they keep switching them up from day to day.

77
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:46,151
Scott: Yeah, I would just have a different knot every day.

78
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,175
Scott: I'd be like today.

79
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:48,200
Scott: We're gonna do it to enhance.

80
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:53,760
Rym: How come you're so excited about knots and belts and knots and shoes But yet you only know how to tie one kind of time.

81
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,335
Scott: It's the weakest tying tie because tying a tie is harder than tying a row.

82
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:57,797
Rym: It's not.

83
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,520
Rym: it's really easy.

84
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:06,140
Scott: I know I watch those YouTube videos and I copied them But the point is is it's because it's like around your neck and you got to use a mirror.

85
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,227
Scott: It's more difficult than this tying a rope.

86
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:11,760
Rym: That's like, oh, yeah, you definitely need to use a mirror if you suck.

87
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:20,809
Rym: Yeah, anyway, anyway, I'm a fan of the full Windsor but on the train I Finally because I stopped playing advanced wars.

88
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:27,420
Rym: I also stopped playing advanced wars and I got to the owl mission That actually that's the only mission I ever got to see on.

89
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,887
Scott: Yeah, I just I I could beat it.

90
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,214
Scott: I just it's retake.

91
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,157
Scott: It's the way I'm.

92
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,725
Scott: I tried to do it And it's just TD.

93
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:35,692
Rym: Well, you're doing it wrong.

94
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:45,080
Rym: I'm probably doing it wrong but the way only reason I got to see is because I Basically, there's two ways to play advanced wars the and this is in every advanced wars other than this one.

95
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:59,210
Rym: The newest one is a not quite like this, but you can either play perfectly and pretty much never lose units or Play realistically and I will like lines of infantry marching forward to their death.

96
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,457
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much like over.

97
00:05:01,557 --> 00:05:13,130
Scott: either overwhelm the guy with superior force and tactics and you know But people are dying all over the place or build a very small amount of units very cleverly So you sneak in and win somehow.

98
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:17,645
Rym: What I love about the new advanced wars is that for the most part that doesn't work.

99
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:23,286
Rym: Yes a real war game It's like the best like oh my god advanced wars is such a good game.

100
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:28,810
Rym: It's pretty good But yeah, but I stopped playing it because I had a million other games to play and I've been watching avatar.

101
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,867
Rym: But I suddenly had the advanced wars bug again, which I get periodically like when I lived in the mountains out in poquoi.

102
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:37,609
Rym: I Saw that was when I decided you know what?

103
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:43,370
Rym: I'm gonna beat the advanced campaign on advanced wars one and I'm gonna keep beating it until I get an S.

104
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:44,736
Scott: That's just a great.

105
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:52,508
Rym: and then I did the same thing in every other advanced wars and as of today I finally beat every single mission in advanced wars on that campaign.

106
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:53,010
Scott: with an S.

107
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:59,850
Rym: I got almost all S's and A's Alma and I have like one see the owl mission and I have two B's.

108
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,440
Scott: Yeah, you gotta tell me how to do that stupid owl cuz.

109
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,499
Scott: if I beat that I'd probably pick up the game and finish it Off, all right go around the edges.

110
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,283
Scott: I did that.

111
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:13,165
Rym: It just took so long Slow how long you think you can beat it in like 40 days.

112
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:14,189
Scott: That's a long time.

113
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:19,930
Rym: Let me you might not like the rest of that game then because I'm gonna warn you about something.

114
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:23,085
Rym: One of the a lot of the missions was one in particular.

115
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,170
Rym: That's called Jay Islands.

116
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,602
Rym: It's a four player every man for himself map against the AI.

117
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:28,565
Scott: I think I beat that one.

118
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:29,388
Rym: Did you?

119
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:30,652
Rym: I don't know How long did you take you?

120
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:35,770
Rym: because I beat it in like 50 something days with heavy losses.

121
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:36,673
Scott: Yeah, I did.

122
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:37,698
Scott: I did play a map.

123
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:39,545
Scott: That was four islands every man for himself.

124
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:47,418
Scott: There's a lot of maps like that I know but basically all I did was I attacked one of the other islands took it over and as soon as I had two Islands, the other two islands were just cake.

125
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:50,350
Rym: I just washed them by taking forever and taking heavy losses.

126
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,629
Rym: I got an S because that's what it expected you to do.

127
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:59,930
Rym: Yeah, I think I got an S also and whichever one I'm thinking of I don't know why you're having so much trouble with the owl the one after it is a thousand times harder.

128
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,413
Rym: Well, I don't.

129
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:01,721
Scott: I haven't had that one yet.

130
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:03,029
Scott: Have I you know what?

131
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,338
Rym: It's kind of like man.

132
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,070
Rym: I can't climb this 10-foot rope.

133
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:11,244
Scott: If only I could climb the 10-foot rope, but it would it would hurt.

134
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:12,267
Scott: so it's kind of like.

135
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:14,215
Scott: it's not fun And it's supposed to be fun.

136
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:14,939
Scott: It's a video game.

137
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,623
Scott: So I'm not gonna do it.

138
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,346
Rym: Here's the problem.

139
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:18,555
Rym: All right I don't want to climb this 10-foot rope.

140
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:19,178
Scott: little.

141
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:22,430
Rym: do you know that behind the 10-foot rope is a thousand foot rope?

142
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:30,244
Scott: Yeah in advanced wars really depending on the map in the scenario It's either super fun or maybe not so fun.

143
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:36,850
Rym: The thing is I've noticed at least for me You don't seem to like maps that involve a lot of tactics or strategy or a very large.

144
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:41,046
Scott: Yeah, I really I tend to like the smaller maps, but that's cuz.

145
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:41,930
Rym: then the game's a puzzle.

146
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,098
Rym: It's just it's just battle or but not as right.

147
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:48,613
Scott: and I and I tend to like the maps that don't have like land sea And air.

148
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:53,010
Rym: I like sort of like oh, no, you need all three because then there's so much to the game.

149
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,829
Scott: Yeah, I like sort of like, you know, this land and sea or land and air just land.

150
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,865
Rym: Maybe after the show while we're eating Chinese food out we can play some tiny maps.

151
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,230
Scott: tiny maps are okay.

152
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:10,468
Rym: What I really want to talk about is I've been playing on the Wi-Fi a lot because a lot of people are on there and I like to I don't know.

153
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:18,647
Rym: I've decided that even though it's not challenging like playing on the Wi-Fi is it almost wouldn't be fun because you can't lose to these people ever.

154
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,237
Rym: but there's something about like beating.

155
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:28,410
Rym: the AI is one thing even especially if they because AI is really good, but You don't really get that visceral satisfaction.

156
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:37,447
Rym: But every time I play on the Wi-Fi it's like I get these moments where I'm Spreading out all over the map and my guys are everywhere and it's always fog of war and like

157
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:38,070
Scott: bump

158
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:44,787
Rym: I'll see him like run a few of the guys He sent out into my mass to the north and you I know on the other he's going.

159
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,130
Rym: god damn it All right.

160
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,768
Rym: At least I can take the area to the south and then he runs into my guys down there, too.

161
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,058
Rym: Ah, at least I can take the middle.

162
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,150
Rym: then he runs into my guys there and that's right about when they always quit.

163
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:06,047
Rym: Mmm, I don't know if I'm just a Freak and I'm like beyond good at this game or I just I'm playing against the wrong people, but I've never lost good God.

164
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:08,208
Scott: Yeah, I don't know me.

165
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:16,650
Scott: Maybe you just had to keep playing online Until like you have the highest rank or whatever and then maybe someone will realize you're so awesome or I don't know.

166
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,081
Rym: I'm scared because I asked in the forum and no one answered.

167
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:20,367
Rym: is anyone out there good?

168
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:23,481
Rym: at advance Wars I want to play against someone who's good.

169
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:27,082
Rym: No one in the front row crew is good And yes, I'm serious about that.

170
00:09:27,122 --> 00:09:28,249
Scott: you people none of us are.

171
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,976
Scott: You're not claiming to be good.

172
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:35,636
Rym: pretty much every time we play it'll be a four player free-for-all and it's like Scott will always be yelling.

173
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,800
Rym: All right other Scott.

174
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:38,286
Rym: don't let Rym win.

175
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:39,290
Rym: Don't let Rym win.

176
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,909
Rym: Let's all gang up on Rym, but then no one gangs up on me.

177
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:44,522
Rym: And then the next thing they know I've got three quarters.

178
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:47,817
Scott: even if they do getting up on you It only helps a little.

179
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:51,030
Scott: we really we really have to gang up on you full-on.

180
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,830
Rym: I kind of want to make a video of like how to be good at advance Wars.

181
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:57,050
Scott: Yeah, we need to get one of those DS video capture thingies.

182
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,275
Rym: Yeah, the problem is the.

183
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,850
Rym: the answer is very simple plan 20 turns in advance.

184
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:03,557
Rym: Count all your money.

185
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:05,725
Rym: spend exactly all of it all the time.

186
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:06,267
Scott: Yeah.

187
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:09,201
Rym: Yeah Anyway, anyway, what do you got in the news?

188
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:11,010
Rym: You can tell it's kind of a light news day.

189
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:15,829
Scott: Yeah, there wasn't so much news going on, but I did notice something that is very special for me.

190
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:22,850
Scott: You know Nintendo with the Wii and the Virtual Console, you know It's been a while since we talked about the Virtual Console.

191
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:31,342
Scott: but you know Nintendo has been releasing new games in the Virtual Console every Monday as Promised since the Wii came out and that's that's pretty impressive.

192
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:32,266
Scott: They just kept it up.

193
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:33,270
Scott: They kept on trucking.

194
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,459
Rym: Yeah, well probably because they're selling.

195
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:37,869
Rym: they're making so much money off of good weird.

196
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,772
Scott: It's like I could.

197
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,439
Scott: I could easily have ROMs.

198
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:40,881
Rym: I do.

199
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:43,089
Scott: I buy Virtual Console games anyway.

200
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:49,930
Scott: The reason I actually the reason it's worth it for me to buy them is cuz number one.

201
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,957
Scott: I don't buy that many.

202
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,750
Scott: so it's even though it's a ripoff price.

203
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:53,676
Scott: It's not.

204
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:55,830
Scott: you know, I don't buy so many that it hurts my wall, too.

205
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,975
Rym: I mean, they are perfect.

206
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:59,850
Rym: Like if you want to play StarTropics, that's the only way to play it.

207
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,015
Scott: Yeah, cuz those wrong.

208
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,140
Scott: There's the ROMs don't work.

209
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:03,165
Rym: The ROMs are all that curse.

210
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,671
Rym: the game barely worked I know.

211
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:10,649
Scott: and the other thing that you get by buying the Virtual Console games is you get to play with a decent controller.

212
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,741
Scott: now You might be saying I'll plug a gamepad into your PC.

213
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,283
Rym: Oh, no.

214
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:14,484
Rym: No.

215
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:14,725
Rym: No.

216
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:15,287
Rym: Well one.

217
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,170
Rym: No, it's not good God.

218
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,618
Scott: But well, you could get a higher quality.

219
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:19,790
Scott: you can use an Xbox 360 controller on your piece.

220
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,936
Rym: I'm still pretty crap for these games.

221
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:23,590
Rym: What you need is the SNES USB controller.

222
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,296
Scott: Yeah, yeah, you can get that too.

223
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:28,469
Rym: or you could just associate your remote bluetooth.

224
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:29,984
Scott: wise Yeah, you could do that, too.

225
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:36,030
Scott: But you know this just sort of just works and it's easy and it's easy to do to player and all that.

226
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:39,370
Scott: So, you know for a game that's a really special game.

227
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,202
Scott: I'll buy the Virtual Console game and for a long time.

228
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,090
Scott: most of the Virtual Console games are coming out.

229
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,470
Scott: Some of them have been good, but none of them really made me want to spend money on them in a while.

230
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:52,023
Rym: You gotta be in the Mike Tyson's punch-out class of game.

231
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,710
Scott: Yeah, I think that's like the last one we bought right?

232
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,395
Scott: Yeah, pretty much zero X.

233
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:58,049
Rym: I think I also call God if super dodgeball hits that thing.

234
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,417
Scott: Dogil's gonna the DS soon.

235
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,869
Rym: I know I know but I want the original on the VC.

236
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:10,666
Scott: But anyway this week they came out yesterday with two Virtual Console games that are must buys.

237
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:14,363
Scott: they're both games I originally owned on the NES and I'm gonna buy him again.

238
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,750
Scott: It's so sad.

239
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:19,321
Scott: The first game is a little story, right?

240
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:29,767
Scott: So Emily has this baseball anime she likes right and Like you're in the kitchen once and she was just like Jaja Jaja Jaja Jaja Jaja Jaja Jaja.

241
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:34,010
Scott: and I was like Are you singing the song from Bases Loaded?

242
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,850
Scott: Cuz like I. you know Emily's cool and she plays video games, but I didn't think she ever played Bases Loaded.

243
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,210
Scott: So I was like, how did she know the song from Bases Loaded?

244
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:44,252
Rym: It's like.

245
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,381
Rym: most people our age don't know the song from bass.

246
00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:48,270
Scott: I know so she's well, she is our age.

247
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,377
Scott: Guess well close to it.

248
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:56,567
Rym: Well, it's weird how we're so close in age And yet we're like, we're definitely children of the 80s and she is definitely more child of the 90s.

249
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,220
Scott: Yeah, baby She's just like.

250
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:01,682
Scott: yes And I'm like, how do you know Bases Loaded?

251
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:04,112
Scott: and she was like in the baseball anime I watch.

252
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:07,846
Scott: the guy like came up to bat and he was singing Jaja Jaja Jaja Jaja.

253
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:15,330
Scott: So obviously the people who make the baseball anime played Bases Loaded for the NES and they had.

254
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:19,142
Scott: They had their character also play Bases Loaded for the NES.

255
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:24,122
Scott: and I'm thinking well if I played baseball I would probably be I would have them play that.

256
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:32,190
Scott: when I went up to the math went up to You know the seat the PA system, but because that is one of the best baseball and bass bass is loaded.

257
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:40,000
Scott: I mean if you're talking about good baseball games, it's pretty much it's like with every sports game There's an unrealistic and a realistic right?

258
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:48,585
Scott: So for example with ice hockey realistic you've got Blades of Steel and unrealistic ice hockey with baseball.

259
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:52,917
Scott: You've got baseball simulator 1000 or 10,000 or a million or whatever 1000.

260
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,662
Rym: Yeah one dot zero.

261
00:13:54,722 --> 00:14:02,765
Scott: and for realistic you've got Bases Loaded, you know for football You've got unrealistic Mutant League football and you got realistic Tecmo Bowl, right?

262
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:07,662
Scott: So Bases Loaded I think is there's just something about that game.

263
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:10,150
Scott: It doesn't have any official teams, right?

264
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,336
Scott: But it has great music.

265
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,943
Scott: the controls and the fielding actually work.

266
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,550
Scott: the hitting and pitching mechanic is actually complex.

267
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:23,141
Scott: You actually have to put in relief pitchers, you know because they wear out and they all have different like pitching styles.

268
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:30,984
Scott: and it's really interesting to watch the way different guys throw the ball and they and like all the batters have different stances and they have their.

269
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:36,610
Scott: you see their names up there and they actually Even though they don't say anything they barely have any faces.

270
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:44,586
Scott: They all have like character and like I always played as this one team and it's like some of the batters just better than others like as they should be.

271
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:50,690
Rym: and it's like I Used to sit there and make all the stats for all my teams and baseball simulator.

272
00:14:50,710 --> 00:15:00,714
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, you know, I had like characters on my team like Warner and I was like, oh Warner's my man He stands up perfectly straight and he just always it's a home run Like I had.

273
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:04,770
Scott: like I had a you know certain pitchers I chose in a certain order like I remember their numbers.

274
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:15,650
Scott: I was like I use you first and I use you in the middle of the game and then you come in and you're the Relief pitcher and they they all had a different style and it really it's a high-quality baseball game and it's awesome.

275
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,263
Scott: So the other game is a game.

276
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:18,150
Scott: I love that Rym hates.

277
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:21,428
Scott: Well Yoshi's cookie fuck that game.

278
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:23,496
Rym: I'm sorry.

279
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:24,342
Rym: That game was not.

280
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:32,520
Scott: she's cookie is the best Is the best the best the best game to player Versus puzzle game ever.

281
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:34,109
Rym: I much prefer.

282
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,929
Rym: Well puzzle game Advance Wars one.

283
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,334
Scott: Now, you know what?

284
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:41,905
Scott: I mean that sort of blocks moving around Tetris II kind of puzzle.

285
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:42,527
Rym: No, dr.

286
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:43,069
Rym: Mario.

287
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,355
Scott: Dr Mario is real good.

288
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,179
Scott: It's real.

289
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:45,782
Rym: Dr.

290
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:46,405
Scott: Mario.

291
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:46,666
Scott: Dr.

292
00:15:46,686 --> 00:16:01,545
Scott: Mario is awesome but I think Yoshi's cookie has a slight edge because Yoshi's cookie has this sort of mechanic where you line up the Yoshi cookies and with just the right timing to get like the certain You know effect to happen and it's I just love Yoshi's cookie.

293
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:02,970
Scott: This is the NES version.

294
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,990
Scott: There was an SNES version which is basically improved graphics and sound and a few extra features.

295
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:14,990
Scott: But really I think the NES version was the best implementation of Yoshi's cookie, and I really like Yoshi's cookie.

296
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,427
Scott: So if you like puzzle games Yoshi's cookie Yoshi's cookie.

297
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,756
Scott: Yoshi's cookie Not the original Yoshi.

298
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:21,540
Scott: Remember the games.

299
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,870
Scott: It was just called Yoshi for the Gameboy and the NES.

300
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:25,616
Rym: I'm trying to remember.

301
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,705
Scott: it was like the things would come down and you would like.

302
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:35,062
Scott: they would be bloopers and goombas And you have bottoms of shells and tops of shells.

303
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,287
Scott: game was crap and you would.

304
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:37,853
Scott: it was okay But it was pretty bad.

305
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:40,102
Scott: Mario would just sort of spin the things around.

306
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:42,812
Scott: you have a lot of control and it you couldn't but That was.

307
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:46,390
Scott: it was an okay Gameboy game, I guess but Yoshi's cookie was far as a berry.

308
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:50,308
Rym: So I got a real brief news just because this is kind of interesting.

309
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:56,917
Rym: but Nintendo has been working with Pokemon to fight Counterfeiters like Nintendo is Pokemon.

310
00:16:56,937 --> 00:17:01,210
Rym: Yes, but it's funny because this headline here says quote Nintendo and Pokemon.

311
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:07,367
Scott: but I think Pokemon is like a like this game freaks and it's sort of like this subdivision of Nintendo.

312
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:11,248
Scott: that sort of Nintendo owns it but it's like oh, you know, here's the explanation.

313
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:15,145
Rym: It turns out that Nintendo sent ash along with Charizard.

314
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:15,867
Rym: So there we go.

315
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:30,192
Rym: Okay Yeah, anyway, pretty much the deal here is that there's Pokemon piracy, but it's not the games It's the cards for the card game and there's a multi-million dollar worldwide bootlegging Organization.

316
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:32,378
Scott: how can owns bootlegging magic cars?

317
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:33,883
Rym: I'll bet people were.

318
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:35,327
Rym: maybe I would.

319
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,918
Rym: I mean I wouldn't bootleg them.

320
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:45,505
Rym: But if I were playing magic back in the day before, you know Kind of this new wave of everyone plays these sealed deck whatever tournaments.

321
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:48,970
Rym: I Would have had so many bootleg magic cards.

322
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:50,532
Scott: Yeah I mean Why not?

323
00:17:50,552 --> 00:18:05,216
Rym: I used to play actually with a lot of like Italian magic cards because they they reprinted lotuses and everything in Italy With pretty much as many as you wanted, but then tournaments caught on they wouldn't let you play with non English cards Even though that

324
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:06,282
Scott: anyway, it's bullshit,

325
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:07,830
Rym: but I found this kind of funny.

326
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:13,858
Rym: So kids if you play the Pokemon game like hard game Well, mostly parents your kids play the Pokemon game.

327
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,563
Rym: go to Chinatown.

328
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:19,677
Rym: You can buy those cards real cheap Yeah, and what's what's the difference?

329
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:21,062
Scott: as long as they're in English, right?

330
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:22,045
Scott: You can read them.

331
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:23,270
Scott: You can play with them.

332
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:25,739
Scott: So what what the fuck do you care if they're not official?

333
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,024
Scott: real deal, whatever's.

334
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:28,650
Rym: well, it's bad for Nintendo.

335
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:30,862
Scott: That's the dirt Nintendo is doing.

336
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:31,345
Scott: just fine.

337
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:32,250
Rym: trust is illegal.

338
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:33,635
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

339
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,283
Scott: I guess it really is a copyright infringement.

340
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:38,130
Rym: It's no different than stealing a DVD.

341
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:40,159
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

342
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,653
Scott: but you know buying a poke I don't know.

343
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,539
Scott: for some reason it feels like it's not.

344
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,287
Scott: it's not bad, but I guess it is kind of.

345
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:48,170
Rym: I just find it funny.

346
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,794
Rym: I'm indifferent.

347
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:49,296
Scott: Yeah.

348
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,584
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

349
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:52,493
Scott: from the players standpoint It's like why not?

350
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:56,490
Scott: the thing is I think it piss off a lot of people who are like collectors.

351
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:58,806
Scott: But if you're a collector, it's like screw you.

352
00:18:58,867 --> 00:18:59,330
Scott: it's a game.

353
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,038
Scott: It's meant to be played for fun here.

354
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:03,350
Scott: if you want if you need money get a job.

355
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,370
Scott: You'll make a lot more money get a job than collecting suit Pokemon card.

356
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:09,710
Rym: There's one thing people who like collected because they like them.

357
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:16,644
Rym: But I know a lot of people who collect collectible card games because they're sure that much like Magic the Gathering They'll increase in value now

358
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:18,494
Scott: even if they do

359
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:19,538
Rym: well the amount of

360
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:23,832
Scott: time and effort it takes to collect them and do all that bullshit and eBay and Not

361
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:24,374
Rym: only you could be

362
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:26,501
Scott: working and making a lot more money at a job.

363
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:30,373
Rym: my mox emerald and whatever magic cards I've got for like.

Rym: I got a revised set and all this stuff.

00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:36,933
Rym: They're not really worth much more now than they were Ten years ago.

366
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:41,825
Scott: I make enough to buy a revised set in like less than a week.

00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:50,362
Rym: All right, I'll stall for some time.

00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:52,150
Rym: cuz God do your news.

373

Rym: Okay, so advanced wars, but seriously pretty much everyone I've played against online.

Scott: the price on this is five bids.

383
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,205
Scott: This is a real-deal auction.

384
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:34,874
Rym: Guess what the price is $1,000 not even close 10,000 not even close a Hundred-thousand.

385
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:37,382
Scott: now your way you're getting farther away 20 bucks.

386
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,268
Scott: No, it's a hundred and fifty dollars and 75 cents.

387
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:44,350
Rym: Wow, my magic cards were worth a lot more ten years ago than they are now.

388
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:52,760
Scott: Meanwhile right under that there's Magic the Gathering 40 revised dual lands I have like multiples of every dual land.

389
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,065
Rym: Those things were uncommon.

390
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:57,390
Scott: They're not it's not they weren't rare Yeah, but it's you know, those are the only dual lands there.

391
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:06,949
Scott: Meanwhile, the set of 40 dual lands has 16 bids is gonna be over in a day And it's six hundred dollars, huh?

392
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,003
Scott: So that revive of you the real the revised set must have one of each.

393
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:12,750
Scott: do a little bit, right?

394
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:13,916
Rym: Think carefully.

395
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:14,257
Rym: does it?

396
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:14,800
Rym: does it?

397
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:15,343
Scott: Yes.

398
00:21:15,464 --> 00:21:16,127
Scott: Yes, it does.

399
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:21,333
Scott: Ah Anyway Freaking collectors get a job.

400
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:31,026
Rym: So things of the day.

401
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:34,250
Rym: I'm continuing my those were the days theme week.

402
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:36,349
Rym: I think this is pretty cool by thinking the day.

403
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:40,264
Rym: I'm using it partly because it's it's so barely related.

404
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:41,990
Rym: the guy happens to play the song.

405
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,892
Rym: Those were the days.

406
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:49,810
Rym: but the real reason I'm using this because I'm sure many of you have heard this instrument before.

407
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:51,436
Rym: Yeah, I mean, it's a really Herman.

408
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:53,403
Rym: No, not the theremin.

409
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,190
Scott: No the kazoo not the kazoo.

410
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,602
Scott: Oh the Hammond organ Hammond organs.

411
00:21:58,682 --> 00:21:58,944
Scott: All right.

412
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,470
Rym: I like the Hammond organ a lot.

413
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,150
Rym: In fact, my grandma had a Hammond organ that I used to play constantly as a little kid.

414
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:07,616
Scott: That's the one with like the little.

415
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:10,407
Scott: there's like two pianos one on top of the other and you could.

416
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:10,929
Scott: there's these things.

417
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:12,926
Scott: you can Pull on that sort of point towards you.

418
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:16,866
Rym: Yep And those different those determine like what harmonics you'll get to play and there's also pedals.

419
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:17,750
Rym: There's also pedals.

420
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:19,456
Scott: It's kind of small though, right?

421
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:24,348
Rym: It's like they can be big but they could be but it's the ones we buy are like what they Were is they were early?

422
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:34,450
Rym: synthesizers and a lot of like churches would use them as a low-cost alternative to a pipe organ because pipe organs are Expensive most hard things that can ever exist.

423
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:41,805
Rym: See as down as I am on religion I Really really like pipe organs that pretty much you want to get me into a church.

424
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:44,248
Rym: the fastest way to do it is tell me There's a pipe organ there.

425
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:49,630
Scott: They just you know, turn all churches into at least the ones with pipe organs into dis organ concert halls.

426
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:52,263
Rym: Actually, there's a somewhat famous pipe organ up in Poughkeepsie.

427
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:53,750
Rym: There's concerts semi regularly.

428
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:55,056
Rym: I just haven't had time to head up there.

429
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:56,462
Scott: Yeah, but is it all churchy?

430
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:58,050
Rym: No, no, not at all.

431
00:22:58,275 --> 00:22:58,770
Scott: No, okay.

432
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:08,456
Rym: but anyway, the the Hammond organ is used extensively in blues and jazz and The Blues Brothers movie.

433
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:15,119
Rym: that like you have an organ is everywhere and when you hear it played you'll know exactly What that instrument is.

434
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:16,730
Rym: part of the reason they're really cool.

435
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,596
Rym: Is that kind of like a pipe organ?

436
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:22,709
Rym: one person can play the melody and the harmony and the bass line at the same time?

437
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,840
Rym: Mmm, and this exemplifies that it's a good video.

438
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:29,890
Rym: and if you're interested in Hammond organs, let me know.

439
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,830
Rym: I'll do a show on them because I kind of know a lot about them and they're kind of cool.

440
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:33,312
Scott: I don't know.

441
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:35,645
Scott: think about Hammond organs other than what they look and sound like.

442
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:36,610
Scott: I don't know how to play one.

443
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,455
Scott: I don't know how it works.

444
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:40,229
Rym: what they look and sound like is mostly what you need to know.

445
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,396
Rym: They work is not that interesting.

446
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:46,226
Scott: it's basically aren't some of them like electronic or all electronic.

447
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:47,490
Scott: Yeah, so it's a deal.

448
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:48,917
Rym: They were early synthesizers.

449
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:49,982
Scott: I remember like that.

450
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,550
Scott: Oh, that's someone's house who had one.

451
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,390
Scott: They plugged in and started like worrying and yeah loud noise.

452
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:56,542
Scott: Well before you even pushed any keys.

453
00:23:56,904 --> 00:24:02,370
Rym: part of the deal, too Is that this kind of sounded bad early on like they had a lot of problems.

454
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:07,566
Rym: But now people who use these things like they got used to those bad sounds.

455
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:08,730
Rym: so technology got better.

456
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,559
Rym: but people want them to still sound that way.

457
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,398
Rym: that sound that's kind of hissy and and Wavery and bad is what people like.

458
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,090
Scott: That's why I'm sure we can just simulate Hammond organs with computers now.

459
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:22,783
Scott: Oh, we most definitely can know what.

460
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:23,710
Scott: do you don't need to have an organ?

461
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,530
Rym: See, well, you still need the Hammond organ interface if you want to play.

462
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,689
Scott: Well, you can just take like a double keyboard with levers and plug it into the computer you could.

463
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:33,475
Rym: yeah I wonder if anyone's done that.

464
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:33,896
Scott: I'm sure.

465
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:42,250
Scott: so maybe I'm sure if you went to those people who sell organs to old people to Rip them off that they would have for you and a let a MIDI Hammond organ.

466
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,479
Rym: No, no, you don't want MIDI.

467
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,394
Rym: I already realized a Wonderful market opportunity.

468
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:51,247
Rym: So we make a Hammond console that has all the interface of a Hammond.

469
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:52,250
Scott: It's also a computer.

470
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,534
Rym: It's no it's two pieces.

471
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:59,961
Rym: the piece that goes on the desk and then a pout of the pedal board for your feet is separate All right, and it's just USB.

472
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:01,390
Rym: and then we sell software.

473
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:05,625
Scott: All right, that would make we have Hammond Hammond hero, huh?

474
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:07,110
Rym: You know what I do though.

475
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,610
Rym: I would use the Hammond interface to play like TIE fighter.

476
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:18,236
Scott: So There's an NES game called glider.

477
00:25:18,457 --> 00:25:19,099
Scott: Have you ever heard of it?

478
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,727
Scott: No, cuz it's kind of scarily new.

479
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:27,522
Rym: That's why Is this one of those someone put together a hacked ROM and made an NES game?

480
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:38,505
Scott: I actually know it says here a glider Game and name copyright 1989 John Calhoun, but it looks like a really new NES game At least I never heard of it before now.

481
00:25:40,314 --> 00:25:41,850
Scott: And it says coming early April.

482
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:44,059
Scott: So it's early April and I think they sold out.

483
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,204
Rym: or are you sure they're not?

484
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:51,729
Scott: it's not coming early April 1990 I'm sure because this is all over all the video game news websites like right now.

485
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,601
Scott: But basically that's not the important part of this story.

486
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:57,865
Scott: the game itself.

487
00:25:57,926 --> 00:26:09,203
Scott: the game itself is you know It's a game where you control the paper airplane and like air vents lift you up But you try to get across the room without touching the floor, you know that game All right, the important part of this game is it's on an NES cartridge.

488
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:11,090
Scott: You can play it in an NES.

489
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:16,118
Scott: it will work right but The NES cartridge right.

490
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,990
Scott: if you're gonna make an NES cartridge today, right?

491
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,524
Scott: What would you put on the circuit board in the NES cartridge?

492
00:26:22,604 --> 00:26:23,890
Rym: probably an emulator?

493
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:32,553
Scott: No Like hardware wise a hardware NES emulator it wouldn't be that hard Probably.

494
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:34,601
Rym: and then a bunch of ROMs.

495
00:26:34,842 --> 00:26:36,468
Scott: now what they did put in there USB.

496
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:46,450
Scott: Well, like nothing actually is not a USB, but there is some flash memory Instead of you know, just you know ROM like in the olden days.

497
00:26:46,631 --> 00:26:56,070
Scott: So they have a flash memory and then like an an NES interface Note they had if you buy a separate device called a USB copy nests, right?

498
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:02,772
Scott: Which is a device that is basically takes NES cartridge on one side and USB on the other side Huh?

499
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:14,289
Scott: If you buy that device which could normally allow you I think to rip ROMs if you get that device then you can put download and flash new levels into this game.

500
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:21,950
Scott: and You know, that's not so exciting nowadays where we have, you know, like the r4 for the DS and stuff like that, right?

501
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,030
Scott: but Imagine if someone had given you back in the day an NES cartridge.

502
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:30,910
Scott: Well, you could download you could put new levels onto that card.

503
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:32,195
Rym: I remember in middle school.

504
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:36,108
Rym: There was a kid in our street who claimed that he had a ROM dumper.

505
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:37,294
Rym: Uh-huh.

506
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,199
Rym: It turned out.

507
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:39,989
Rym: No, he had a game genie.

508
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:47,930
Rym: Suffice to say no, but like that was the same kid who stole another kid's Megaman 3 and then traded it to me for hide lied.

509
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:50,274
Scott: Well, he got the worst end of that.

510
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,297
Rym: but then the kid came.

511
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:54,185
Rym: he's like, where's my Megaman 3?

512
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:58,096
Rym: and I was like I traded Hydlide for you're not getting it back.

513
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:01,308
Scott: I would have given it back saying don't worry that kid got me deserved.

514
00:28:01,328 --> 00:28:01,970
Scott: He got highlight.

515
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:04,435
Rym: I did give it back.

516
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:06,422
Scott: Yeah, I mean highlight is crap.

517
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:08,490
Scott: I'd rather have nothing than have highlight.

518
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,829
Rym: You think is highlight was not the worst game on the NES?

519
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,595
Scott: No, it wasn't.

520
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:12,340
Scott: but like it was weird.

521
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,665
Scott: because you look at highlight and you're like Concept of my blood you go god damn.

522
00:28:16,706 --> 00:28:17,250
Scott: That's awesome.

523
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,756
Rym: But then you play it and it doesn't work.

524
00:28:19,037 --> 00:28:21,267
Scott: if someone made a highlight that works.

525
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:22,090
Scott: That'd be awesome.

526
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:23,235
Scott: Oh so awesome.

527
00:28:23,255 --> 00:28:23,917
Scott: But yeah, is?

528
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:27,070
Scott: it is a cool get any s game you could plan it on?

529
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,043
Scott: Yes, you could flash new levels into it.

530
00:28:29,063 --> 00:28:30,150
Scott: That's pretty awesome.

531
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,009
Rym: I got to say though saying oh what if you gave it to yourself as a kid?

532
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,920
Rym: What if you gave yourself a DS?

533
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,302
Rym: is a kid?

534
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:36,792
Rym: Holy shit What if?

535
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:40,750
Rym: what if shit your pants an iPod an mp3 player?

536
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,027
Scott: I just I just pee on everybody the monitor I have.

537
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:48,425
Rym: now I I don't know what I do if I saw a monitor like this twice.

538
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:52,496
Scott: I think it was like a TV But it's flat.

539
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:53,642
Rym: Oh, right.

540
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:54,586
Scott: It's flat.

541
00:28:54,707 --> 00:29:00,006
Rym: Oh shit Goddamn just give a kid like the USB Drive.

542
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:00,610
Rym: I got right here.

543
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,286
Scott: I would just sell it to the richest person on earth for like a billion bajillion dollars.

544
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:06,916
Rym: the USB Drive I'd be like, what's that?

545
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:09,768
Rym: But - if someone said there are two gigabytes on that.

546
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:11,093
Scott: Oh my god I remember.

547
00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:12,237
Scott: and so what's a gig of?

548
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:12,718
Scott: they had this.

549
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:15,167
Scott: the guy had this big box like it was.

550
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:16,110
Scott: it was big.

551
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:29,243
Scott: It was like it was the size of like an automatic card shuffler, you know That's you know, like that kind of yeah, and it was heavy like it weighed a good 10 pounds or more Right, and it had a little apple on it and it was an external hard drive.

552
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:35,626
Scott: and they said and the guy was from England He was like, this is one gigabyte and there's an Australian accent.

553
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:36,650
Scott: Sorry, right?

554
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,396
Scott: But it was one gigabyte and it was like.

555
00:29:40,557 --> 00:29:42,422
Scott: everyone was like, holy shit.

556
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:44,788
Scott: Holy shit one gigabyte, right?

557
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:48,197
Scott: Wow But now I carry one gigabyte.

558
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:49,701
Scott: like is smaller than my thing.

559
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:53,170
Rym: I carry two and in the Marantz is four.

560
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,257
Scott: Yeah, okay.

561
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,843
Scott: All right, let's do the show.

562
00:29:57,145 --> 00:29:57,446
Rym: Okay.

563
00:29:57,466 --> 00:29:58,550
Rym: So what are we talking about tonight?

564
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:00,954
Scott: We're gonna tell you about that DS game the terrible one.

565
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:03,078
Scott: Oh, oh we revealed it was terrible.

566
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:09,061
Rym: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for the DS ring of fates is fades.

567
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:11,970
Scott: It's not they're not even gonna beat around the bush.

568
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:13,350
Scott: It's a bad game.

569
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,134
Scott: this game is with little redeeming qualities.

570
00:30:16,455 --> 00:30:25,270
Rym: bad to the point that I'd pre-ordered two copies of it and Then I had pre-ordered a third copy for Emily because we thought oh, we'll all play together.

571
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:35,669
Rym: You know like the other Crystal Chronicles, which we have described more than once as a trend send an experience even worse because it was A Square Enix game right that said Final Fantasy on it.

572
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:39,825
Scott: It was $40 instead of the usual $30 DS game price.

573
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:56,105
Rym: So alright Not only did I cancel the third pre-order for Emily, but I played two of the quote-unquote missions and I poked around at everything else and I don't know anyone want the game.

574
00:30:56,388 --> 00:31:02,075
Rym: Yeah Well, I gotta get rid of this game cuz I think I'm gonna give mine to Emily so she can see and then it will Give it away to someone else.

575
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:05,250
Scott: Yeah, maybe she'll like it cuz she's never played a game like that.

576
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:12,690
Rym: But I doubt it, you know The game could have been fun if you'd handed it to me along with the DS back when I had my game gear.

577
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,564
Rym: But even then crystal warriors for the game gear was a much better game.

578
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,146
Scott: That's true.

579
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:17,668
Scott: That's true?

580
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:26,270
Rym: Yeah, of course I'll warn you all because it's relevant crystal chronicles for the crystal warriors for the game gear is just advanced wars.

581
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:27,838
Rym: Yeah fantasy.

582
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,930
Scott: Well, it's that you mean you mean it's Fire Emblem.

583
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:32,669
Rym: It's more like advanced wars.

584
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:38,790
Scott: Speaking of Fire Emblem because Fire Emblem DS is eventually coming for sure, but not soon.

585
00:31:39,172 --> 00:31:42,789
Scott: I pre-ordered Rondo of Swords from Atlas which is gonna come out on the 15th.

586
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:45,709
Scott: I can't guarantee this is gonna be good.

587
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:56,090
Scott: But you know, it's a normal $30 price DS game and From what I've seen it has the potential to sort of sate your Fire Emblem desires until Fire Emblem DS comes out.

588
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,556
Rym: I'll hold out until Scott tries it.

589
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,043
Scott: Yeah, I pre-order Amazon.

590
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,710
Scott: So I mean it's like a week away.

591
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,633
Scott: So it was.

592
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:01,914
Rym: I got.

593
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:02,757
Rym: I got some time.

594
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:06,510
Rym: I gotta work all my rankings in advance Wars up to s.

595
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,794
Scott: Yeah, two weeks or now.

596
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,438
Scott: I'll tell you if it's a good buy or not.

597
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:09,759
Scott: Right?

598
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,350
Scott: Anyway, so crystal chronicles ring of fates for the DS.

599
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:22,180
Scott: I'm pretty sure first we're gonna bash this game directly and then we're gonna compare it to the original crystal Starts out right away.

600
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:27,629
Rym: I started and the music sounds really good And then I watched the opening kind of like sequence.

601
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:39,407
Rym: now I remember when we played crystal chronicles for the GameCube and the opening movie was I mean It wasn't beautiful in an animation sense because it was mostly game plans

602
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:40,892
Scott: mostly the music That was beautiful

603
00:32:41,053 --> 00:32:52,407
Rym: the music and the atmosphere and everything that the potential that they put before me was Wonderful, and it gave us all that feeling of we're about to have a gaming experience

604
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:53,290
Scott: and we sure did

605
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:53,753
Rym: So

606
00:32:54,175 --> 00:32:56,370
Scott: even though that game really, you know, well that game was.

607
00:32:57,391 --> 00:33:02,690
Scott: Well the original crystal chronicles right as a game not not the greatest game.

608
00:33:02,952 --> 00:33:04,730
Scott: It was pretty much a walk around hit things game.

609
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,890
Rym: But what it was was it was basically just a tech demo saying it was a proof of concept.

610
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:19,810
Rym: Look this kind of collaborative game this kind of cooperative Multiplayer game with this kind of hidden information mechanic is solid gold and we've proven that it can be done.

611
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,882
Scott: yeah, even it makes even a crap game.

612
00:33:21,962 --> 00:33:23,008
Scott: great right.

613
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:26,035
Rym: and The not even gameplay.

614
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:42,887
Rym: the intro the you know FMV before you play the game game Was little shit kids in a crappy childish story and they took Everything that was good about the atmosphere of crystal chronicles and did a 180 like.

615
00:33:42,927 --> 00:33:45,848
Rym: I cannot express to you How awful and stupid it is?

616
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:52,470
Rym: It's like yeah, you're a kid and you got a little sister I'm gonna go on an adventure and you're all snarky with each other.

617
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:53,816
Rym: But then you go and meet the ukes.

618
00:33:54,077 --> 00:34:02,370
Rym: now the ukes were a really interesting race in the original game But the ukes in this game talking this rhyme II sing song II bullshit.

619
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:02,913
Rym: It's.

620
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:04,541
Rym: it's painful to listen to.

621
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:08,077
Rym: and I say listen because it's voice acted But some parts of voice acted.

622
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:09,943
Scott: some parts are even read.

623
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,750
Scott: the text on the screen is awful.

624
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:13,114
Rym: It's like if you.

625
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:17,090
Rym: it's like if we took Star Wars right and then we made a new Star Wars.

626
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:25,650
Rym: But instead of Yoda like if we all Yoda was he was concentrated into his poor grammar And that was everything that was left of Yoda.

627
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:26,411
Scott: Yeah, I mean like.

628
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:41,050
Scott: Yoda is awesome because he has the silly grammar right, but it's simultaneously like Endearing but also wizened right and I think that's what they might have been thinking of when they made the ukes like this like Oh, we can make the ukes talk funny and then they'll be kind of like Yoda.

629
00:34:41,317 --> 00:34:48,370
Scott: But no The problem is the Oaks are just kind of come off as stupid as opposed to being sort of mysterious in it.

630
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:54,351
Scott: You know like at times like oh and at times ha ha ha it's always Grown.

631
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:59,933
Rym: we went from crystal chronicles on the GameCube, which if you haven't played the game This is not a spoiler.

632
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:04,307
Rym: But to me the defining moment of that game the moment where everyone in the room went.

633
00:35:04,788 --> 00:35:07,809
Scott: Wow That Wow is the loaf of bannock.

634
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:14,309
Scott: Never underestimate the power of a loaf of bannock and that there's no loaf of bannock in this.

635
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:17,660
Rym: now There's just blah blah blah indubitably blah blah blah.

636
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,744
Rym: and do they say indubitably?

637
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:20,570
Scott: way too much way too much.

638
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:26,690
Scott: I wonder who the first person to say indubitably was because I feel like a lot of silly cartoon characters have said that word over.

639
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:31,078
Rym: Yes, but I Didn't think it could get worse than that.

640
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,748
Rym: And then I met the first little tea.

641
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:38,070
Scott: The lilt ease in the first crystal Chronicles are sort of like dwarves like, huh?

642
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:42,210
Scott: But they were you know, they were small and they didn't look quite like dwarves except for their smallness.

643
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,597
Scott: But they were hard core.

644
00:35:43,617 --> 00:35:44,783
Scott: They were hardcore sort of.

645
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:45,888
Scott: you know dwarves like huh?

646
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:52,048
Scott: This this little T the main little T in the game is so like it's like a TV.

647
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:55,335
Scott: I don't know what it is But it's frightening.

648
00:35:55,375 --> 00:36:00,818
Scott: and the main character like always goes in like rubs its head and then it goes like squee Or whatever it does.

649
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:01,321
Scott: I don't know.

650
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:01,804
Scott: You know what?

651
00:36:02,105 --> 00:36:02,850
Rym: what bothers me, too?

652
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:10,486
Rym: There's a frightening amount of sexual tension between that little boy and that little T It's but the little T's like a hundred years old which just makes it even worse.

653
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:11,310
Scott: It's really bad.

654
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:14,100
Rym: It's really bad and don't get me started on the humans.

655
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,955
Rym: It's like the atmosphere of the game is Nothing.

656
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:25,675
Rym: It's not a Final fantasy like advanced tactics was a better Atmosphere than this.

657
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:29,450
Scott: Yeah, I think the thing is the original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles to the Gamecube.

658
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,200
Scott: Your characters didn't have names.

659
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:34,210
Scott: They didn't have voice acted it have words.

660
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,870
Scott: It was a lot more like they were, you know, they weren't even like link, right?

661
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:38,730
Scott: They were not a part of the story.

662
00:36:39,011 --> 00:36:44,550
Scott: They were just people going out to get crystal water to help their town get through the year.

663
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:47,198
Rym: There wasn't even an epic plot.

664
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:47,801
Rym: you were just.

665
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:48,966
Rym: this is your job.

666
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:54,064
Rym: if you fail You know everyone that you know and love your family who was writing letters to you will die.

667
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,392
Scott: and that and all the plot of The world.

668
00:36:56,633 --> 00:37:08,956
Scott: it was sort of like the plot of the world and you were just happened to be in it and it was revealed To you by people you meet on the road or things you see on your journey to go and collect more water And you know stuff like that.

669
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,190
Scott: and there wasn't this epic plot surrounding your characters.

670
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:13,958
Scott: Characters were sort of like.

671
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:17,554
Scott: it was more of a role-playing game Where you actually like.

672
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:21,007
Scott: my character was named Scott and I felt like he was me sort of.

673
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:21,610
Scott: you know.

674
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,976
Rym: It's like it's one of those.

675
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:29,925
Scott: the characters are named not as much as like in a real role-playing game But more than in a final final final identify with them and the world.

676
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:31,330
Rym: the world was not plotty.

677
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,550
Rym: It was atmospheric and that counted for so much.

678
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:43,690
Rym: I mean in in this game in the original game when you know We'd move between places then we'd run until into someone on the road and we'd get a little snippet of their story.

679
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,630
Rym: And then someone else's story and everyone's story was a real story was interesting.

680
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:53,854
Rym: There were real heroes going around the world and we were just some kids Trying to do our job.

681
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:57,147
Scott: Yeah, that was that one little tea who was like wicked badass with the horns.

682
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:57,810
Scott: What was his name?

683
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,733
Rym: Oh the Black Knight.

684
00:37:58,773 --> 00:37:59,396
Rym: What's his name?

685
00:37:59,536 --> 00:38:00,821
Scott: No, not the Black Knight the other one.

686
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:02,026
Scott: His name was like Alto.

687
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:04,795
Scott: Oh, yeah But yeah, that was.

688
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:05,559
Scott: it was pretty awesome.

689
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,730
Rym: But so the atmosphere of this game is gone.

690
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:12,238
Scott: Yeah, it's basically Generic even worse than a Final Fantasy plot.

691
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:16,030
Rym: It is a generic fantasy plot like quest had a less flimsy plot.

692
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:23,770
Scott: It's basically like oh the king is good But he's been overcome by the bad guys and the bad guys are in the temple and they're all evil.

693
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,630
Rym: Oh and your family's involved.

694
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:33,560
Rym: You're a little kid and you're destined to blah blah blah and you got your little kid sister with you and yay And his monsters all around town.

695
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,825
Scott: You got to go clear them out.

696
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,734
Scott: Oh It's pretty bad.

697
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:41,469
Scott: so that aside let's talk about the actual gameplay.

698
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,296
Scott: now The gameplay is a little different.

699
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:45,778
Scott: It's pretty.

700
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:49,228
Scott: it's somewhat similar to the original crystal chronicles, right in that

701
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:52,098
Rym: it's Superficially kind of looks the same

702
00:38:52,158 --> 00:39:00,790
Scott: and that you walk around and hit things and you have you know Magic spheres you use to cast your magic spells and you have you know, you sort of upgrade your items in a similar way.

703
00:39:02,192 --> 00:39:05,304
Scott: The problem is they added in this platforming element.

704
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:06,670
Scott: now, I really don't have a problem.

705
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,655
Scott: I like a platforming.

706
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:12,457
Scott: platforming actually is good because it sort of you know Makes it better than just a walk around hit things game.

707
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:16,310
Scott: The problem is the platforming is finicky and shitty.

708
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,810
Scott: It's really hard to do especially if you're trying to control four characters at once.

709
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:25,850
Rym: It also had there been an atmosphere kind of would have ruined it, but luckily there was no atmosphere to ruin.

710
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:28,443
Scott: Yeah, well at least the gameplay didn't ruin the atmosphere.

711
00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:36,153
Rym: the atmosphere ruined the atmosphere But had the game had good atmosphere, I think jumping up and down trying to get to treasure chests Nothing.

712
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:36,937
Rym: I care about.

713
00:39:36,997 --> 00:39:40,030
Scott: by the way, here's an example of how the platforming is shitty, right?

714
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,362
Scott: So each character has different power.

715
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,709
Scott: that's needed to do Platforming, right?

716
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:59,507
Scott: So for example, there'll be a very small platform like enough for one or two characters to fit on comfortably, right and You can only control one character at a time and you switch between them and you can sort of push the L button to teleport All the other characters near you.

717
00:40:00,352 --> 00:40:05,510
Scott: So one character the lilty has to make a pot and then the pot will sort of activate on this platform.

718
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:08,870
Scott: Then you need to get the cell key to stand on the pot.

719
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:10,116
Scott: Then the plot will hover.

720
00:40:10,438 --> 00:40:12,710
Scott: then the cell key does like a double jump off the pot.

721
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:20,204
Scott: Then you need to teleport the uke up to the new platform You're on so that you can use the stylus to turn on a torch to activate a thing.

722
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:23,357
Rym: and now now now before we go Any further because this this is.

723
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:29,350
Rym: this is the reason why this game is shit Like this is the core of why this is a bad game.

724
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:36,310
Rym: Imagine if you would add puzzles like that in the original crystal chronicles where there's four players, right?

725
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:53,183
Rym: Awesome like if puzzles like that because the puzzles in the original crystal chronicles were as good as they could have been with the limitations of the technology if they had had puzzles like this were like I Have as the cell key have to fight my way to this side of the map and hold a position while you guys go and do this other puzzle.

726
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:58,350
Rym: then the door opens and then we We work together and everyone has their own information of their own role to play.

727
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,521
Rym: Kid can you play this crystal chronicles multiplayer?

728
00:41:04,822 --> 00:41:07,350
Scott: you can kind of but it's a different game.

729
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:09,990
Scott: The multiplayer is a different game than the single player.

730
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:13,970
Rym: Wait, so the only you might tell that I'm asking question.

731
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:15,735
Rym: You can go.

732
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:17,542
Scott: you can go to the levels where they.

733
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:19,330
Scott: this platforming stuff is going on.

734
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:23,289
Scott: You know and you can do that that platforming stuff multiplayer it can happen.

735
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:43,376
Scott: But actually because of the way the levels are structured and stuff it's actually really hard to coordinate all the different people to do these platforming things together and be in the same place at the Same time and like one guy makes the pot and getting your friend to jump on the pot And I mean in on paper, that would be really great But in reality it just doesn't work out.

736
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:48,041
Rym: and part of that I think is because I said one the platforming part was really ill-conceived.

737
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:56,490
Rym: but to The the way it's like playing the original crystal chronicles that you want to play it with other people because it's the shared experience.

738
00:41:56,651 --> 00:42:00,637
Rym: I mean everyone who played the game goes a loaf of bannock Oh the end and all.

739
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:02,689
Rym: but playing it by yourself isn't really that fun.

740
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:06,320
Rym: So you kind of are expected to have all your friends playing through the plot.

741
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:13,102
Rym: and because your characters are faceless and because the plot In the world, they're just atmospheric around you you kind of get drawn in.

742
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:19,863
Rym: but with this game if you play a multiplayer It's not like you're all just playing the plot together.

743
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:22,110
Rym: It's like hey, let's beat a dungeon together.

744
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:24,097
Rym: Yeah, it's very like it's.

745
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:27,490
Rym: I don't want to use the term episodic, but it's like an episodic show.

746
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,333
Rym: It's not like.

747
00:42:28,393 --> 00:42:37,624
Scott: it's basically like World of Warcraft, but there's no you know Big world or anything speaking of World of Warcraft unlike the other crystal chronicles.

748
00:42:37,644 --> 00:42:38,487
Rym: The game has leveling.

749
00:42:39,129 --> 00:42:41,878
Scott: Yeah Yeah, the original crystal chronicles.

750
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:52,296
Scott: All it had was when you beat a level right and Of all the items you've picked up during the level everyone gets to pick one and whoever did the best in that level gets to pick first

751
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:52,902
Rym: right

752
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:56,450
Scott: and Some of them would just be like plus two strength, you know.

753
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,079
Scott: but some of them would be like new moogle pocket or whatever.

754
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,059
Rym: and the thing is that wasn't so much leveling as it was kind of a Customization because eventually you start getting duplicates.

755
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:09,070
Scott: Yeah, you're only allowed to have one of everything, right?

756
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:16,350
Scott: So eventually or you know moogle pockets You can get more than one of but eventually you're gonna get all the items and then that's it, right?

757
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,239
Scott: But you'd sort of choose which ones.

758
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:20,370
Scott: Okay, you let the you take the plus two magic.

759
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:22,202
Scott: Let the normal guy take the plus.

760
00:43:22,243 --> 00:43:29,730
Rym: or maybe you know The uke wants the plus two magic But Rym doesn't want to give it up because he wants to cast spells and he did better in that level.

761
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,222
Rym: So he's just gonna take it and everyone goes.

762
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:31,888
Rym: Oh, man.

763
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:40,230
Scott: Yep But the way this new one works Right is you sort of just picking up stuff constantly like you like you kill a guy and his items all over the place.

764
00:43:40,974 --> 00:43:44,250
Rym: So many treasure chests that I didn't give a shit anymore and I just stopped bother.

765
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:48,496
Scott: You just keep pushing buttons to pick shit up and pick shit up and also have to pick everything up Individually.

766
00:43:48,536 --> 00:43:48,597
Rym: if

767
00:43:48,617 --> 00:43:55,085
Scott: you want to get the good shit You've got to go and do even more tricky platforming to get to trickier and trickier treasure chest

768
00:43:55,125 --> 00:44:09,943
Rym: plus unlike the previous Crystal Chronicles, you know, I'm not gonna compare to the previous Crystal Chronicles in this game like the level of crap Doesn't even matter customization of get all these items to build this item and build this item.

769
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:10,405
Rym: and it did.

770
00:44:10,706 --> 00:44:13,959
Rym: and it's all this kind of Final fantasy tactics II stuff.

771
00:44:14,281 --> 00:44:18,750
Rym: but unlike Final Fantasy Tactics It has none of the charm and none of the interest.

772
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:27,370
Scott: I think the real the original fancy fantasy Crystal Chronicles is so great because it was so different from most of the other Square Enix type of RPGs.

773
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:35,192
Scott: But this one sort of takes that and reels it back into the Square Enix Empire and thus sort of ruining it and making it It's.

774
00:44:35,313 --> 00:44:35,796
Rym: it's like they.

775
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:37,850
Rym: they made a proof of concept.

776
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:43,330
Rym: They proved that a new kind of game could be made and that Nintendo had facilitated this.

777
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:48,846
Rym: you know because back then you had to connect the Game Boy advances to the GameCube to get that experience.

778
00:44:49,327 --> 00:44:51,876
Rym: and now the Technology is a thousand times better.

779
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:55,570
Rym: We could connect DS's to a we we could connect DS's to each other.

780
00:44:55,911 --> 00:45:02,809
Rym: There's so many screens and so much processing power and they decided well So we proved that we can make that awesome game.

781
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:04,329
Scott: Let's gonna make something worse.

782
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:09,672
Rym: Let's not make that game and forget about all the all the new game mechanic things We tried.

783
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:13,407
Rym: and let's make something like every other game in the world and then make it shitty.

784
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:19,010
Scott: on top of that Yeah, let's concentrate more on the customizing of how your character looks, you know by changing their items.

785
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:26,770
Rym: Oh, it is fine in a stateful like massively multiplayer game where you can at least show it to someone.

786
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:27,913
Scott: Well, you can.

787
00:45:28,154 --> 00:45:28,776
Scott: the idea is you'll.

788
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:32,388
Scott: when you play against other people they'll see your character but that's not the same.

789
00:45:32,448 --> 00:45:41,238
Rym: it's so meaningless, yeah, I mean how many people care about whether in advance wars your hawk is Purple with gold hair.

790
00:45:41,258 --> 00:45:42,885
Rym: I don't know with white hair.

791
00:45:42,985 --> 00:45:44,130
Scott: Maybe Japanese people?

792
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:44,693
Scott: I don't know.

793
00:45:44,935 --> 00:45:51,410
Rym: see maybe the game appeals more to a Japanese audience But I can tell you this it doesn't appeal to people who like a game.

794
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,107
Rym: It doesn't appeal to someone who likes a story the one at the.

795
00:45:55,207 --> 00:46:00,844
Scott: one last thing I have to say about why this game is bad and it's another comparison with the original and the original.

796
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:01,365
Scott: right.

797
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:09,770
Scott: one person had the map One person had where the items were right one person they were the bad guys were and the other person had something else, right?

798
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:14,444
Scott: Each person on their Gameboy advanced screen had different information.

799
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:16,210
Scott: All right, and it wasn't perfect.

800
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:19,001
Scott: I mean the map was so much more useful than everything else,

801
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:19,422
Rym: but it was

802
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:33,054
Scott: fun, but it was fun Communicating between the players all this information that like only one person knew where to go But they had to tell everyone else where to go, you know, and there was the pot which you know The the the.

803
00:46:33,495 --> 00:46:39,990
Rym: the buskit which was there was necessary and a lot of people were bleh about it But it made for a lot of really interesting fun game.

804
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,526
Scott: It was it was sort of a double-edged sword the buskit, you know.

805
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:52,574
Scott: on the one hand It's sort of forced everyone to stay in the same area Alright, but on the other hand it was sort of annoying and you know to carry it around all the time and hurt and you'd get Hurt and shit, right?

806
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,490
Scott: But you know, it sort of helped heat the game together in a way.

807
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:56,813
Scott: Let's

808
00:46:56,854 --> 00:47:04,302
Rym: imagine with the new technology They could have had places where you can all go wherever you want But then sometimes you got to use the buskit anyway,

809
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:12,350
Scott: right in this game Basically, if you're all on a screen anyone can go anywhere on the screen that they want, right?

810
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:21,564
Scott: So that whole buskit stick together mechanic kind of falls apart because you'll just run around all over the place killing things on their own Whatever and then you only need to all group up again.

811
00:47:21,584 --> 00:47:24,147
Scott: when you want to go to the next screen You'll have to go to the door at the same time.

812
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:28,819
Scott: and the second thing is that Everyone has all these same information.

813
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,804
Scott: Everyone has the map.

814
00:47:29,924 --> 00:47:34,665
Scott: Everyone has the same thing so that Communication with the other players totally sort of falls apart.

815
00:47:34,766 --> 00:47:37,670
Scott: You don't need to communicate You all just need to be like are we done with the screen?

816
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:39,118
Scott: All right, which screen do you want to go to?

817
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:40,710
Scott: All right that one or I never go to that one.

818
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:46,827
Rym: There's just so much wrong with this game that I I think it's not even worth playing.

819
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:52,380
Scott: Yeah, I'm sad I spent my money on it, but I'll Give it to someone else.

820
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,609
Scott: I guess I can't throw it out.

821
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:55,258
Scott: this Seems kind of like a waste.

822
00:47:55,399 --> 00:47:56,545
Rym: the people want this game.

823
00:47:56,645 --> 00:47:59,478
Scott: You can try it Well sell it to you for cheap.

824
00:47:59,538 --> 00:48:01,406
Scott: I guess like shipping plus a few bucks.

825
00:48:01,527 --> 00:48:01,889
Scott: I don't know.

826
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:03,715
Scott: It's a $40 game.

827
00:48:03,776 --> 00:48:06,405
Scott: I'd give it up for like maybe 10 that this is.

828
00:48:06,847 --> 00:48:09,579
Scott: if nothing else Maybe I'll just auction it or eBay.

829
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:21,309
Rym: original Crystal Chronicles was Like an experience if you played it with a group of friends in One go or even just if you played it with a group of friends because it wasn't just on the same group of friends.

830
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,937
Scott: the Whole time makes a real big difference.

831
00:48:23,037 --> 00:48:23,318
Scott: Actually.

832
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:23,941
Rym: Yes, it does.

833
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:38,390
Rym: But I don't know I was I. that experience was such an amazing thing that I was willing to sight unseen spend 40 bucks on a Game that had a good chance of not even being close to that because there was that tiny

834
00:48:38,854 --> 00:48:45,720
Scott: Same name that was and that wasn't you know The other days on the cache of the previous game with the same name We bought the second game of the same name.

835
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:47,470
Scott: and now this game is terrible.

836
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:55,030
Rym: And now this is gonna be like a WiiWare one Which is also it might be the good part of Actraiser, but you have to pay to customize it.

837
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:55,933
Rym: So that's gonna.

838
00:48:55,993 --> 00:49:04,410
Rym: that's gonna be bad now and they've already tell that Crystal Chronicles on the Wii The real one is primarily a single-player game much like this one.

839
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:05,574
Scott: Screw that too.

840
00:49:05,674 --> 00:49:09,850
Scott: So they basically just they made a great game and then they made three follow-ups.

841
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,115
Scott: They're all gonna be shit.

842
00:49:11,376 --> 00:49:13,886
Scott: and what one is shit, and I'm pretty sure the other two are gonna be shit.

843
00:49:13,926 --> 00:49:16,575
Scott: and Final Fantasy I think is completely dead to me.

844
00:49:16,615 --> 00:49:25,395
Rym: and all except for old Final Fantasy remade the last ones I enjoyed or one two three Six seven six.

845
00:49:25,575 --> 00:49:26,759
Rym: I like seven six.

846
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,267
Rym: I like six a lot though and legend three.

847
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:31,636
Rym: on the Gameboy Legend two was better.

848
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:37,437
Scott: No, dad's legend - dad is a stealth fighter I win I don't know legend - had the scene.

849
00:49:37,598 --> 00:49:38,721
Scott: dad is a stealth fighter.

850
00:49:38,782 --> 00:49:40,507
Scott: regain your health by sitting on the toilet.

851
00:49:40,588 --> 00:49:42,608
Scott: in the stealth fighter I win once again.

852
00:49:43,073 --> 00:49:47,559
Rym: Legend - had the scene where you know like you have like everyone has their music.

853
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:54,350
Rym: like Final Fantasy games are big about the music even on the Gameboy and There was like the heroes theme that played when you the heroes are doing shit.

854
00:49:54,932 --> 00:50:18,918
Rym: And there's one point near the end of the game where you come across a room and your eaves dropping and in the other room are like the three mini bosses of the game talking to each other and they've got these crystals that you need and Then your music starts playing which you think all right We're gonna bust in and fight him now but instead one of them looks up in that you know Final Fantasy look up way in those games where the sprite changes a little bit and goes Where's that music coming from?

855
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:19,681
Rym: Oh crap.

856
00:50:19,702 --> 00:50:26,182
Scott: Let's get out of here, and I'm like oh Let me ask you does that have in that game?

857
00:50:26,603 --> 00:50:28,710
Scott: is your dad a v2 bomber?

858
00:50:29,134 --> 00:50:29,579
Rym: You know what?

859
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,650
Rym: in Final Fantasy?

860
00:50:31,494 --> 00:50:36,146
Rym: Legend one You instead of a ship you got an entire island.

861
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:42,148
Scott: Yeah, but uh what was your dad a v2 bomber in for my dad?

862
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:53,184
Rym: I don't want to ruin Final Fantasy 4, but my dad was like a. No your dad's not the whale I know just and then I go to the moon in a whale still the.

863
00:50:53,386 --> 00:50:58,130
Scott: I Really can't sort of beat the dad as a stealth bomber.

864
00:50:58,973 --> 00:50:59,700
Rym: We're so done.
