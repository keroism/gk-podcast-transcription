00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,171
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 20th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:18,164
Rym: Tonight, we talk about Final Fantasy Advance 4.

3
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:19,158
Rym: Alright, let's do this.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:19,861
Scott: Alright.

5
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:25,100
Scott: So, I have, you know, normal $10 Sony earbud headphones.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,060
Rym: Yep, yep, and they're kinda crappy.

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:28,805
Scott: In fact, they broke.

8
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:30,313
Scott: My brother, in fact, had the same ones.

9
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:31,800
Scott: They also broke in the same manner.

10
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,720
Scott: And not to mention that they damage hearing.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,971
Rym: Yes, significantly so, in fact.

12
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:38,999
Rym: More so than you might think.

13
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:49,200
Scott: Like, I didn't know it, but then I checked up, and apparently, because they don't block out any external sound, people tend to turn them way, way up.

14
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:56,220
Scott: And having things with all those extra decibels for extended periods of time damages hearing a lot.

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,840
Rym: And it used to be not a big issue, back in the days of, you know, Walkmans and Discmen.

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,708
Rym: And there's a very simple reason for that.

17
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,940
Rym: People didn't listen to their Discman 24 hours a frickin' day.

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,539
Scott: Yeah, but my iPod Nano can hold 4 gigs of music, and the battery lasts 8+ hours.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,038
Rym: Fantastic.

20
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,640
Scott: And it's really small, and I can take it with me anywhere, and I can jog with it, and who knows.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,653
Scott: So, there's really potential to damage my hearing significantly.

22
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,340
Scott: Like, we're talking multiple rock concerts per day significantly.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:42,240
Scott: So, I wanted to get new headphones, and the obvious solution was to get those big ones to cover your ear, and maybe have noise cancelling, and all that good stuff to save my hearing.

24
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:46,731
Scott: But, those really aren't portable.

25
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:51,660
Scott: And I go on a train, and I go to work, and- What's wrong with wearing giant frickin' headphones on the train?

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:02:01,060
Scott: There's nothing wrong with wearing giant frickin' headphones on the train, other than if you try to lean on something to get in the way, but it's transporting the giant headphones that is a problem.

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,999
Rym: You just wear 'em around your neck and be all cool.

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,723
Scott: No, it's not cool.

29
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:07,130
Scott: And it's not comfortable, either.

30
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:10,100
Scott: You can do it if you want, but it's not my preference.

31
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,597
Rym: Alright.

32
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,767
Scott: So, a co-worker informed me of a solution.

33
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:17,052
Scott: There are headphones that you stick in your ear.

34
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:18,756
Scott: Like, all the way in.

35
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:20,280
Scott: Like, you jam 'em in there.

36
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:24,260
Scott: And they block out external sounds.

37
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:26,586
Rym: Yeah, these things are like a vacuum seal.

38
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:32,180
Rym: I tried 'em on, and it's like, going in, going in, suddenly there's this suction, and there you go.

39
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:32,760
Scott: Yep.

40
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:46,874
Scott: You know how, like, when you put your finger in your ear, and all of a sudden all the noises are in your head, and you can hear, like, things touching you, or things in your mouth get really loud, but anything outside your head is like, you can't hear it at all?

41
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:48,120
Scott: That's what it's like.

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,980
Scott: It's like the headphones are not only headphones, but are fingers that are in your ear.

43
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:57,460
Rym: So, uh, you used to make fun of people, like our friend Ken, who bought the crazy expensive awesome headphones.

44
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,398
Rym: But, uh, I think you see the light now?

45
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,360
Scott: Well, those were, you know, his were a little more than mine were.

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,623
Rym: Well, his headphones are insane.

47
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:10,580
Rym: We got a friend who's got, like, these multi-hundred dollar velvet-lined, like, monitor headphones of the gods.

48
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:11,212
Rym: Yeah.

49
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,620
Rym: Like, they're better than our stereo.

50
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,660
Scott: Yeah, well, the point is that these headphones are pretty much as good as headphones need to be, unless you're a DJ.

51
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:20,999
Rym: Yeah, and, you know, they'll save your hearing, so, uh...

52
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:22,102
Scott: Yep.

53
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:25,240
Scott: The other thing was, I didn't get them at, like, a normal store.

54
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:34,259
Scott: I went, and, 'cause I was worried that they were gonna be, like, when she told me about them, I thought it was gonna be an audiophile place with all kinds of bull- Yeah, wasn't it called Audio Lab?

55
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,040
Scott: No, it's called Scientific Plastics.

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,463
Rym: Ah.

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:57,680
Scott: So I went over there, and it was just a lab with, like, three old guys in it, and they had the headphones, and they sold them to me, and I paid them my credit card like a store, but these were guys who, uh, made hearing aids, and ear plugs for musicians, and all kinds of custom things in the shape of the hole in your ear, for you.

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,079
Rym: They definitely know what they're doing.

59
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:07,100
Scott: Yeah, it definitely was science, and not BS, and if a guy makes a hearing aid, I trust him to sell me something that doesn't damage my hearing.

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:16,519
Rym: Though, actually, a lot of hearing aids, there are problems where they'll damage people's hearing over time, and it's a trade-off between hearing things now and not hearing things later.

61
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:24,099
Scott: Well, as if you're really deaf, then they have to put- the only way you can hear with a hearing aid is make it really loud, and there's no way around that.

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:24,528
Rym: Yeah.

63
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,380
Scott: But these guys definitely knew what was up, and it was a cool place.

64
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,140
Rym: I like how your receipt looked more like a prescription than it did a receipt.

65
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,860
Scott: Yeah, it was a handwritten deal, you know, it wasn't a store, so what do you expect?

66
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:36,578
Rym: Yeah.

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,518
Rym: Though, in real news, most of you probably don't care if you don't live in New York, but there's this transit strike going on.

68
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:45,617
Rym: Oh yeah.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,900
Rym: So all the subways and buses and everything aren't running?

70
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,138
Scott: Nope, not at all.

71
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:58,540
Rym: And it doesn't affect us at all, because the train that goes between here and the city, while it's part of MTA, the workers on the train aren't striking.

72
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,240
Scott: Yeah, the strike is a transit union strike, not an MTA strike.

73
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,680
Scott: So the MTA is actually pissed at the transit union.

74
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:07,652
Scott: Like, "Get to work, you

75
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,159
Scott: asshats!".

76
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:12,820
Scott: But the transit union, which is the buses and subways, are not working.

77
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,640
Scott: And they're going to be in big trouble.

78
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:18,580
Rym: Yep, they're being fined a million dollars per day.

79
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:26,160
Scott: So, and if you're a worker, and let's say you make ten bucks a day, I'm just, no one makes ten bucks a day, but I'm just picking a number.

80
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,818
Rym: Well, in the West.

81
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:28,180
Scott: Okay.

82
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,560
Scott: But I'm just picking a number, just to make the math easier.

83
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:34,216
Rym: Yeah.

84
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,918
Scott: They're fined twenty dollars a day.

85
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:41,240
Rym: So not only do they not get their ten bucks, but they owe the government twenty dollars.

86
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,199
Scott: Well, they owe the government ten bucks.

87
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,496
Scott: Because they take away the ten bucks you would have made, well...

88
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,840
Rym: No, they're not making money because they're not working.

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,725
Scott: Ah, that's true.

90
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,356
Scott: If they were, well, I guess if they...

91
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,380
Rym: If they were working, there wouldn't be an issue.

92
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:04,260
Scott: Yeah, so it's like, even though it sounds like double-suck, it's really triple-suck, because you don't make the ten dollars you would have made, unless you're a salary, I guess, unless you get a paid vacation, who knows?

93
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:13,039
Rym: Well, strike is a weird situation, because the transit union, public workers, in New York, at least, don't have the legal right to strike.

94
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,559
Rym: But they have the legal right to unionize.

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,940
Rym: Which is kind of weird, because the primary power of a union is its ability to strike.

96
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,147
Rym: Mm-hmm.

97
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:32,720
Rym: So it was kind of like this union existed, but couldn't really do anything, and they said they were going to strike, and the mayor said, "If you strike, I'll destroy you, and you'll all go to jail,".

98
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,500
Rym: and they struck anyway, and no one knows what to do, and the city's grinding to a halt.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,593
Scott: Well, it's not grinding to a halt for me.

100
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:39,260
Scott: I'm just fine.

101
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,680
Rym: Yeah, because you take Metro North, which isn't striking, and then you walk a few blocks.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,440
Rym: That's great.

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,891
Rym: What about the people living in Brooklyn?

104
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:45,880
Rym: We gotta get to Queens.

105
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,420
Scott: They can walk over the Brooklyn Bridge.

106
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:49,979
Scott: If you live in Queens, don't go to work.

107
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:50,791
Rym: Yeah.

108
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:53,790
Scott: There were a lot of private buses driving around.

109
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,180
Scott: There were a lot of cabs going around.

110
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,599
Rym: The funny thing is, they're not letting anyone drive into Manhattan in the morning, unless they have four or more people in their car.

111
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:03,747
Rym: So, there were funny scenes.

112
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:06,319
Rym: If you look around on Flickr, on the internet, you'll find pictures of this.

113
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:15,660
Rym: Expensive, expensive luxury SUVs with cardboard signs in the windows, let's say like Bowery trying to pick up bums or people to sit with them so they can drive into the city.

114
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,760
Rym: It was hilarious.

115
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:18,990
Scott: Great.

116
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,280
Scott: That's cool.

117
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:20,890
Rym: Yep.

118
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:32,096
Rym: Though, there's actually a whole bunch of big news today, but this one made us very happy, and so we really want to talk about it, and the forums, I put a thing about it already, and people were talking about it.

119
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:37,000
Rym: Intelligent Design lost to science, logic, and reason.

120
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:39,580
Scott: Gee, I could have told you that was going to happen.

121
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,505
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

122
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:53,476
Rym: I was worried about what would happen, but I was worried that maybe the judge was going to rule on a technicality, or skirt around the issue, or say something like, "Yeah, Intelligent Design might have been valid, but this case specifically,

123
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:53,878
Rym: blah.".

124
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,200
Rym: Because this case specifically was kind of blah.

125
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,580
Rym: The people involved were actually trying to push creationism, and just using Intelligent Design as a cover.

126
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:11,640
Scott: I hate it when that happens, when you want the judge to say something about an issue in general, but all he does is say something about that case, which leaves all the other cases up in the air.

127
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,028
Rym: Yep.

128
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:13,840
Rym: Or the Supreme Court does that a lot.

129
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:24,099
Rym: Like, when there was the case of the guy who didn't want Under God to be in the Pledge of Allegiance, they threw the lawsuit out, no contest, on a technicality, because they didn't want to worry about it right now.

130
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,458
Scott: It also is kind of stupid, but...

131
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:27,259
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

132
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:29,017
Rym: But they threw the case out, they didn't rule.

133
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:32,398
Rym: either way, they just kind of said, "Ehh, technicality, go

134
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:32,599
Rym: away.".

135
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:44,640
Scott: See, but in a perfect, if our country was good, and not all broken, then you do want judges to just rule on the case at hand, and not in general, because it's really Congress's job to rule in general.

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,019
Rym: The problem is, there are some cases lately that we really need an actual ruling, because Congress isn't stepping up.

137
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,360
Scott: No, they're sucking, because they don't want to lose votes, so they end up not doing anything, because that would mean, responsibility.

138
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:00,718
Scott: Illities!

139
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,720
Rym: People don't like abilities.

140
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,099
Scott: Congress has no illities, and they need some.

141
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:10,659
Scott: They have no abilities, no responsibilities, nothing.

142
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:24,939
Rym: Though, not only did the judge rule against the school board, and not only did he rule pretty much exactly the way intelligent people around the world wanted him to, he went about as far as I would have gone had I been the judge in this case.

143
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:34,385
Rym: He had such choice quotes as, "Our conclusion today is that it is unconstitutional to teach intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in a public

144
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:34,628
Rym: school.".

145
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:51,869
Rym: And my favorite quote, the judge actually said this in his decision, "It is ironic that several of these individuals who so staunchly and so proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and time again lie in my courtroom to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind this ID

146
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:52,314
Rym: policy.".

147
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:53,598
Scott: Wow.

148
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:56,600
Scott: I don't know why he didn't perjury them if you thought they were lying.

149
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,437
Rym: He said he could have.

150
00:09:58,543 --> 00:09:59,940
Scott: He should have contempted them, at least.

151
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,840
Rym: Yeah, he could have been contempted and perjured almost every one of the defendants in this case.

152
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:05,432
Scott: Wow.

153
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,780
Rym: Yeah, but this is a far-reaching ruling, and due to a technicality, there can't be an appeal.

154
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:18,940
Scott: You know, what do you do if you're in a court case and a scientist comes up as a witness, as an expert witness, and he says, "Evolution is bullshit.

155
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,886
Scott: Is that perjury?

156
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:21,577
Scott: Can you jail

157
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:21,698
Scott: him?"?

158
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:24,979
Rym: No, because you can't be perjured for what you believe to be true.

159
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:33,560
Rym: So if you're crazy, and you say something that you think is true, or it can be shown that you thought it was true, they can't get you for perjury.

160
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,460
Scott: What if I just go in and be like, "The sky is green!

161
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:37,756
Rym: La la la la la la la

162
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:37,817
Rym: la!"?

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,920
Rym: They'll probably just get you for contempt for being an idiot.

164
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:41,199
Scott: Oh, okay.

165
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:52,094
Rym: Things like that don't come up often, though actually it's come up a lot recently with, not to get into it, but you know the whole Catholic church, little boys, scandals that have been going around for the last, I don't know, 20 years?

166
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:04,092
Rym: Apparently, and I remember learning about this in Catholic school, because I went to Catholic school in my younger days, but there is an idea in the Catholic church called "mental

167
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:04,620
Rym: reservation."

168
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:12,199
Rym: Because I don't know how much any of you know about Catholicism, but you have to regularly confess all your sins to a priest or you'll go to hell.

169
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,058
Scott: Great.

170
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,854
Rym: So you confess your sins to priests.

171
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:15,400
Rym: Fine.

172
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:22,212
Rym: Priests, supposedly, will listen to you, but will not ever tell anyone, no matter what, what you've told them.

173
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:32,719
Rym: Even if, say, a priest, say you confess that you murdered a bunch of people to a priest, and then you get caught, and the police find out that you confessed to this priest, and they want the priest to testify.

174
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:33,988
Rym: He won't.

175
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,139
Rym: And technically, it'd be perjury if he didn't testify, or if he lied.

176
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:41,520
Scott: Well, no, it's only perjury if he goes on the stand and lies.

177
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,899
Scott: They can't force him to testify.

178
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:46,200
Rym: Well, if he wouldn't testify, then it would be obstruction of justice.

179
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:51,347
Scott: Well, they need a summons or a subpoena or one of those things that makes him be a witness no matter what.

180
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:54,360
Rym: Yes, and if they got him in and he still wouldn't testify, obstruction of justice.

181
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,489
Scott: But... Is it really obstruction of justice if you don't say anything?

182
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:58,720
Rym: It depends.

183
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,406
Rym: It can be.

184
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:01,286
Rym: It's kind of... Do you have to answer?

185
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:05,590
Rym: You only don't have to answer if you might incriminate yourself.

186
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:06,580
Scott: Ah.

187
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,630
Scott: So if you're not incriminating yourself, like if I saw you kill someone and I just don't want to say it, I have to?

188
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:12,074
Scott: Yes.

189
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,266
Scott: Or they can make me say it?

190
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:13,569
Rym: Yes.

191
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:14,740
Scott: Oh, I didn't know that.

192
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:19,997
Rym: Which is a good thing because theoretically our courts are supposed to get to the truth of matters and find justice.

193
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,866
Rym: But you don't have to testify if it'll screw you.

194
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:25,319
Scott: See, but here's the thing, here's the thing.

195
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:27,801
Scott: Let's say I see you kill someone, right?

196
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:28,469
Scott: Yeah.

197
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:31,505
Scott: And they bring me in and they try to make me talk, right?

198
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:36,536
Scott: Now, all they're doing is asking me a question and I have to provide an answer.

199
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:36,860
Scott: Yeah.

200
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,150
Scott: Now, if I say I saw you kill them, well then everything just goes nicely.

201
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:47,680
Scott: But if I say no, then they have to have evidence that says I'm lying.

202
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,840
Scott: And if they have evidence that says I'm lying, why do they even need me for anyway?

203
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:58,447
Rym: See, things like that, I don't know, I never, I mean, I've seen one murder trial, like one actual real trial ever.

204
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:58,689
Rym: Oh, okay.

205
00:12:58,709 --> 00:12:59,677
Rym: I was in the courtroom for it.

206
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:00,382
Rym: Oh.

207
00:13:00,423 --> 00:13:05,039
Rym: And things never turn out the way you might think they turn out in a trial like that.

208
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:06,066
Rym: Everyone's real.

209
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:11,379
Rym: in eloquence, the judge is usually kind of eh, no one really knows what's going on.

210
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:12,746
Rym: Alright.

211
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:14,647
Rym: The witnesses usually just say whatever.

212
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:18,566
Rym: A lot of times they just they just, you don't, like you can't even understand what they're talking about.

213
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:19,899
Rym: They go off on tangents.

214
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:21,119
Rym: Nothing makes sense.

215
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:30,306
Scott: Oh, okay, because I did listen to an audio of a, on this lawyer podcast of a lawyer making a really bad argument in court.

216
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:31,920
Scott: Like, it was just hilarious.

217
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:41,334
Scott: And it sounded like real, and what the judge said sounded like real TV quality court drama, but it was a real court.

218
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:45,980
Rym: I think it's real hit or miss, because the trial I saw was a. it was a federal trial in Detroit.

219
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,052
Rym: I went to watch it for a. there was some class project.

220
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:49,940
Rym: I had to go watch a trial.

221
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:52,083
Rym: And we saw there was this murder trial, so we watched it.

222
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,436
Rym: We were the only people in the audience.

223
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:55,270
Scott: Oh, cool.

224
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:55,778
Rym: Yeah.

225
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:13,760
Rym: But anyway, they have this doctrine called mental reservation, which is an internal church thing where basically a priest can say to himself, it's okay for me to lie and say that he never confessed anything, because I would be violating church rules to say anything because he confessed it in confidence.

226
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,659
Scott: Well, they're going to perjury him right away, aren't they?

227
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,040
Rym: Not because they usually can't prove that the guy said anything.

228
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,340
Scott: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

229
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,940
Scott: Doesn't the priest, like, swear on, like, a Bible before he sucks?

230
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,465
Rym: Yes, yes.

231
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:25,760
Scott: So isn't he going to hell?

232
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,090
Scott: Isn't he catch-22ing himself?

233
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,080
Rym: No, no, you didn't even listen to me.

234
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:29,880
Rym: That's what mental reservation is.

235
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:32,706
Rym: It's okay to lie if it serves the greater good.

236
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,300
Rym: That is the doctrine of Catholicism.

237
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:40,439
Scott: So even though he swears to God that he's going to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help him God.

238
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,020
Scott: And he thinks he's a god.

239
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,314
Rym: Well, you realize you don't have to say so.

240
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:43,880
Rym: help you God.

241
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:45,086
Scott: Oh, that's good.

242
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,600
Scott: But at least he swears.

243
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,040
Rym: Or you have to swear on a Bible.

244
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,359
Scott: Well, you still have to swear.

245
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,507
Rym: Yeah, you have to swear.

246
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:51,720
Rym: I'm not going to, unless you're a Mormon.

247
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:54,440
Rym: They can't make you take an oath, really.

248
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:59,010
Rym: But you're still, you're still on the, you can still be perjured.

249
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,760
Rym: Yeah.

250
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,032
Rym: It's all complicated.

251
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:01,740
Rym: Don't worry about it.

252
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:03,010
Rym: We got off on a tangent.

253
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:09,169
Scott: Yeah, but I still see a catch-22 where they swear, and then they don't.

254
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:11,554
Rym: That's what the mental reservation doctrine is.

255
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,310
Rym: It states that it's okay to lie.

256
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:14,500
Rym: It is not a sin to lie.

257
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,138
Scott: Even if you swear that you're not going to lie?

258
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:22,785
Rym: Yes, because you're lying to serve the greater good by not revealing something that was told to you in the confidence of a church ritual.

259
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:28,483
Scott: But you see, then there's a question of isn't putting the murderer in jail the greater good, not letting him walk the streets?

260
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:35,164
Rym: No, because you're supposed to be able to confess no matter what without any fear of retribution down the earth.

261
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:37,680
Scott: Great.

262
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,382
Rym: Yeah.

263
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:39,920
Rym: I'm not saying I agree with it.

264
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:46,850
Rym: I'm not a Catholic, but I grew up and I went to a Catholic school, and I still remember all that interesting stuff we learned.

265
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:47,213
Scott: Yeah.

266
00:15:47,575 --> 00:15:52,607
Scott: I just thought of the guy in Les Mis where he lets the thief go and he gives him all the silver.

267
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:53,094
Scott: Oh, yeah.

268
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:54,869
Rym: See, that's a cool priest.

269
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:55,838
Rym: We need more priests like that.

270
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,859
Scott: Yeah, but I totally would have let him take the silver and then have the cops grab him.

271
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:02,819
Rym: You ass.

272
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,159
Scott: He's a fucking thief, man.

273
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,919
Rym: Yeah, yeah, give a guy a chance.

274
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,532
Scott: He had his chance.

275
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:09,574
Scott: He still stole from me.

276
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:11,670
Scott: Alright.

277
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:12,420
Rym: Yeah.

278
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:14,834
Scott: So, um...

279
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,839
Rym: So basically, intelligent design was smacked down with no chance of appeal.

280
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:19,827
Scott: Fair.

281
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:20,298
Rym: Yeah.

282
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:24,819
Scott: Alright, so, Google Google, Google, Google, Google.

283
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:29,180
Scott: They have this thing called the zeitgeist which they put out once a month or whatever.

284
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,960
Scott: it updates semi-infrequently.

285
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:32,616
Scott: I think it's a manual update they do.

286
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:32,939
Rym: Yep.

287
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:41,500
Scott: And it gives you statistics like here's the most popular search, here's the most popular sports search, here's the most popular famous people searches, right?

288
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:42,939
Rym: It's usually really surprising.

289
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,568
Rym: It reminds me that most people on the internet are not geeks.

290
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:46,180
Scott: Yeah.

291
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:57,519
Scott: And, uh, because it's almost the end of the year, they've released the 2005 year-end Google zeitgeist and it's like six pages of stats and graphs and lists.

292
00:16:59,163 --> 00:17:03,220
Scott: And it's really freaking cool and interesting to see what shows up here.

293
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,219
Rym: Yeah, apparently Ares the God of War is the number two gainer in terms of search terms.

294
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,740
Scott: Yeah, it's actually a peer-to-peer network.

295
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,099
Rym: Yeah, and a company and a bunch of other stuff but I'm pretty sure the peer-to-peer network is the primary.

296
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,256
Scott: The number one gaining search is Myspace.

297
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:19,346
Rym: Not HiSpace?

298
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:21,079
Scott: No, not HiSpace, sadly.

299
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:29,403
Scott: Uh, Baidu, which is a Chinese search engine that's number three but because it lets you search for MP3s and such.

300
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,789
Rym: Yep, it's basically Google only Chinese.

301
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:32,578
Rym: Yep.

302
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:42,169
Scott: Then you've got Wikipedia, Orcutt, iTunes, Sky News which is a, I think it's a European TV channel, World of Warcraft, Green Day.

303
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:45,340
Rym: Yeah, I want Green Day is like having this resurgence in popularity.

304
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,290
Scott: I'll have to go see if their new music is any good or not.

305
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,654
Scott: I don't know.

306
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:49,219
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

307
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,615
Scott: And then, DaVinci.

308
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:51,848
Scott: Hey, what do you know, number ten.

309
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:57,080
Rym: I have a feeling that's because of the DaVinci code and not so much because of anyone's actual interest in history.

310
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,451
Scott: Oh, that.

311
00:17:58,695 --> 00:17:59,020
Rym: Yeah.

312
00:17:59,603 --> 00:17:59,765
Rym: Oh.

313
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:00,800
Rym: Though something scary.

314
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:03,787
Rym: remember the Janet Jackson boob thing way way back?

315
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:04,332
Rym: Mhm.

316
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,556
Rym: That's still the top search in Google News.

317
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:06,860
Rym: Yep.

318
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:10,979
Rym: More people searched for Janet Jackson in Google News than any other thing.

319
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,869
Scott: Number two was Katrina which is understandable.

320
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:14,940
Rym: Number three was Tsunami.

321
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,060
Scott: Yeah, Tsunami, which is a bigger disaster than Katrina, was one less.

322
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,838
Scott: And then you have Xbox 360, Brad Pitt, Michael Jackson, famous people, famous people, whatever.

323
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,729
Scott: Frugal, which is where you can search to buy things and it gives you the lowest prices.

324
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:31,526
Rym: It's almost all Apple products.

325
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:36,640
Scott: It's all iPod, iPod, iPod, four of the top ten are iPod.

326
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,101
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,143
Scott: Digital camera is number two.

328
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:43,880
Scott: MP3 player, which is kind of like one half of iPod, so four and a half iPod.

329
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:46,139
Scott: Computer desk, not bad.

330
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,567
Scott: Xbox, PSP, laptop.

331
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:50,234
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

332
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:50,760
Rym: Yeah, okay.

333
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,976
Rym: You know, Apple is doing real well with this whole iPod thing.

334
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:54,220
Rym: Yeah.

335
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:02,090
Scott: The other areas of statistics are world affairs, nature, movies, celebrities and phenomena.

336
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:03,060
Rym: They have cool graphs.

337
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,414
Rym: Like, you can see spikes, like when something happens, what people are looking for.

338
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:09,878
Scott: Since I'm not really interested in nature or celebrities, I'm only gonna look at the other three.

339
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,155
Scott: Gonna look at the world affairs.

340
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:12,559
Scott: Let's see.

341
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:20,860
Scott: Oh, this shows you, there's a graph and it shows you that when the search, how how much people search for London.

342
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,974
Scott: And you can see that during the week, searches for London go up and each week end, it goes down.

343
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:28,720
Scott: So it's like up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, right?

344
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:32,539
Rym: Luckily, more people search for the force than the dark side.

345
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:36,599
Rym: Though the dark side had a couple of spikes, but they didn't beat out the force.

346
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,302
Scott: Yep.

347
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:42,699
Scott: You can also see when the pope died, searches for John Paul jumped up a little bit.

348
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,326
Scott: Then it went, you know, it kind of went down a bit.

349
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:51,932
Scott: And then when Ratzinger was elected, searches for him went way up, way higher than searches for the previous pope.

350
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,012
Scott: But then they dropped down to nothing.

351
00:19:54,597 --> 00:20:00,299
Scott: But the John Paul still gets a, you know, a significant amount of searches, even to this day.

352
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,647
Rym: Yeah.

353
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:06,619
Rym: Despite all the Harry Potter phenomena, Hogwarts is searched for very little compared to Middle Earth.

354
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,145
Scott: Hooray!

355
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:13,609
Rym: And surprisingly, March of the Penguins had this like crazy, crazy search spike.

356
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,900
Scott: I don't even know what that is.

357
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,104
Rym: It's that documentary about penguins.

358
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:18,215
Rym: Okay.

359
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:19,534
Rym: All of our friends went to see it.

360
00:20:20,924 --> 00:20:22,360
Rym: And they all said it was awesome.

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,360
Rym: Lisa in particular pretty much just bugged about it for like a week straight.

362
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,322
Scott: Ah.

363
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:27,672
Scott: Yeah.

364
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,651
Scott: Well, here's some interesting ones.

365
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:38,055
Scott: Wikipedia, you can see it jumping up and down, you know, with it coming down on the weekends, has been going up a whole lot since August.

366
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:38,985
Scott: It was kind of like,

367
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:40,217
Scott: "Oh!"

368
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,500
Scott: And it's really getting crazy now.

369
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,711
Rym: I think part of that has to do with, it's been in the mainstream news a lot.

370
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:47,873
Scott: Yeah, Wikipedia is getting a little, uh...

371
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:48,965
Rym: A lot of bad press.

372
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,944
Scott: Yeah, but I like it.

373
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,186
Scott: It's going up, and that can only be good for Wikipedia.

374
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:56,216
Rym: I think Penny Arcade's comic about it was probably all we need to see.

375
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:56,579
Scott: Flawless.

376
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,065
Scott: There's a little Black Friday searching.

377
00:20:59,106 --> 00:21:01,239
Scott: You can see people looking for the sails.

378
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,348
Scott: Oh, here's one.

379
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:06,180
Scott: It has skateboarding, snowboarding, and surfing, right?

380
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,890
Scott: Apparently surfing is more than skateboarding.

381
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,080
Rym: Um, I know that that's probably because surfing also includes the web.

382
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,889
Scott: Yeah, that's the one thing that I want to know.

383
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:25,838
Scott: I'm pretty sure Google is smart, you know, and they know these things, but how can they tell the difference between someone searching for web surfing and surfing surfing?

384
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:26,727
Rym: They probably can't.

385
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:29,233
Rym: They probably just throw these statistics up like, "Hey, here you

386
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:29,374
Rym: go.".

387
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:30,682
Rym: Ah.

388
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,312
Scott: Whoa.

389
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:35,960
Scott: That kind of makes some of these a little silly.

390
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:37,148
Rym: Yeah.

391
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:37,939
Rym: What do you want?

392
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:46,220
Scott: Well, the last graph I want to talk about is this one has a squiggle for MP3, which is way up there, right?

393
00:21:46,820 --> 00:22:01,978
Scott: Then there's a squiggle for iPod, which is much, much lower, but it had a huge jump when the Nano came out, and another little spike when the video one was announced, and since the Nano came out, iPod searches went to a new level and kind of stayed there.

394
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:17,653
Scott: Podcast searches have been increasing, and at some point, which isn't labeled, I think it was when, but it looks like the middle of the year when podcasts became on iTunes, it jumped up a little bit, and it's kind of slowly increasing.

395
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:22,520
Scott: It's like an unstable, very small bit, which means there's a lot of room for growth there.

396
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:22,982
Rym: Yep.

397
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:25,693
Rym: I mean, seriously, we look at our statistics.

398
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:29,248
Rym: Almost none of you use the RSS feed or iTunes.

399
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:31,679
Rym: You're all just coming to the site, clicking on the link every day.

400
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,320
Scott: Yeah, use the RSS feed.

401
00:22:36,043 --> 00:22:36,790
Rym: Be the new wave.

402
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:37,295
Rym: Be cool.

403
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:37,699
Rym: Be geeky.

404
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:38,810
Scott: It's much easier.

405
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:42,529
Scott: Imagine you just wake up, and you go to your computer, and well, there it is.

406
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,440
Scott: You didn't even have to push a button.

407
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,492
Scott: You don't have to visit our site.

408
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:45,120
Scott: You don't have to do anything.

409
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,519
Scott: You just automatically, the podcast will be on your computer whenever there's a new one.

410
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,206
Scott: Of course!

411
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:51,380
Scott: I mean, what do you do?

412
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,440
Scott: What if one day, we release a special episode on a Saturday, and you don't check?

413
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,670
Scott: If you use the feed, you'll get it on the Saturday.

414
00:22:58,873 --> 00:22:59,419
Rym: Of course!

415
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:01,240
Rym: Not to sabotage ourselves.

416
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:02,879
Rym: Still go to the site and check out the forums.

417
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,308
Scott: Oh yeah, of course.

418
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:05,660
Scott: The forums are very important.

419
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,076
Scott: What you want to do is you want to subscribe to the feed and bookmark the forums, and then forget about the site, because the feed has everything that's on the site.

420
00:23:13,096 --> 00:23:14,025
Rym: Ah, the site has the links.

421
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:16,307
Rym: So if you don't know what we're talking about.

422
00:23:16,348 --> 00:23:21,923
Scott: If you need the links, you can go to the site, but the links are also in the feed if you use a feed reader that supports that.

423
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:27,639
Rym: See, I was just saying, because honestly, I don't use the RSS feeds, and anything I listen to, I go to the site and click.

424
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:29,219
Scott: Well, that's because you're no good.

425
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,376
Rym: I don't even have an iPod.

426
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:33,193
Scott: You don't need an iPod to do podcasting.

427
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,440
Rym: I don't have any sort of portable music whatsoever.

428
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:37,010
Scott: You should get some.

429
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:38,245
Rym: I will eventually.

430
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:39,620
Rym: I'm buying a new computer first.

431
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:41,140
Scott: That's probably a good idea.

432
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,499
Rym: So, my thing of the day.

433
00:23:50,685 --> 00:24:01,029
Rym: I will say right now that I saw, I see one reference to my thing of the day, so while I'm going to present it as my thing of the day, I do not endorse 100% that.

434
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:02,120
Rym: I believe this is factual.

435
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,059
Scott: Great, so it might be a false thing of the day.

436
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,352
Rym: Well, it might be, but Joseph Stalin was crazy enough to where I really don't put it past him.

437
00:24:11,836 --> 00:24:12,320
Scott: Oh, Stalin?

438
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,047
Scott: Yeah, he was crazy.

439
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:18,946
Rym: Yeah, basically, this is an article on The Scotsman, talking about how... The Scotsman?

440
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:22,828
Rym: Yeah, it's actually a fairly well-known, pretty good news source.

441
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:23,720
Scott: Of Scottish?

442
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:25,251
Rym: No, just called The Scotsman.

443
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:26,545
Rym: I don't know if it's from Scotland or what.

444
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:27,539
Rym: It's on Fark all the time.

445
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,973
Scott: Willy must read it.

446
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:29,773
Scott: Ugh.

447
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,320
Scott: Bagpipes, golf.

448
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:44,873
Rym: If this is to be believed, then Stalin said the following, "I want a new, invincible human being, insensitive to pain, resistant, and indifferent about the quality of food they

449
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:44,954
Rym: eat.".

450
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:47,684
Rym: He wanted a, quote, "living war

451
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:48,249
Rym: machine.".

452
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:58,900
Rym: So in 1926, he got the Politburo to pass a request to the Academy of Science to try to make a monkey-man hybrid soldier-type creature.

453
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:07,950
Rym: So they tried, supposedly, experiments of breeding humans and monkeys, artificial types, not, you know, bestial ways.

454
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,011
Rym: Ew.

455
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,653
Rym: Yeah, and they tried to impregnate a bunch of women with monkey sperm.

456
00:25:12,814 --> 00:25:13,359
Rym: Didn't work.

457
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:20,633
Rym: Tried to impregnate a bunch of monkeys with women, with men's sperm, or, like, fertilized human eggs, and nothing worked.

458
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:21,300
Rym: Monkey, monkey!

459
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:24,980
Rym: And eventually, the scientist who was in charge of it was sent to jail for failing.

460
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:26,180
Scott: Oh.

461
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,079
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, God shmud, I want my monkey-man.

462
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:41,911
Scott: [laughter] The thing is, the one question I have about that is, why do they think a monkey-man would be impervious to pain and not care about what food you give it, and all those things?

463
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:51,629
Rym: I think they just wanted an animal that was smart enough to use a gun or dig a trench, but not smart enough to want anything more than food at the end of the day.

464
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:51,710
Rym: Mmm.

465
00:25:53,783 --> 00:25:57,019
Rym: 'Cause the Soviet army had a lot of trouble in those days feeding its army.

466
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,679
Scott: You could've just trained monkeys.

467
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,500
Rym: Yeah, I don't know, but they wanted to make some sort of monkey-man.

468
00:26:03,785 --> 00:26:04,399
Rym: And they failed.

469
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:05,404
Scott: Great.

470
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:06,314
Rym: And that's the end of that.

471
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:07,708
Rym: And there's a picture of Stalin.

472
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:14,069
Scott: You know, if you'd just waited, like, a thousand years, some of those monkeys might evolve into, like, Cro-Magnums or something.

473
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:14,512
Rym: Dr.

474
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:15,096
Rym: Zayas, Dr.

475
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:15,439
Rym: Zayas!

476
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,503
Scott: Ohhhhh, Dr.

477
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:17,807
Scott: Zayas.

478
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,223
Rym: So what's your thing?

479
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:22,295
Scott: Well, you know what the best airplane ever is?

480
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,428
Rym: Uh, to me, would be the F-22.

481
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:28,051
Scott: No, it's not the best airplane ever.

482
00:26:28,092 --> 00:26:30,140
Rym: Or the F-117A 'cause I think it's cool-looking.

483
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:32,135
Scott: Oh, the triangle-pointy one?

484
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:32,560
Scott: Yeah.

485
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,689
Scott: Yeah, it's cool, but it's not--.

486
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,808
Rym: I'm partial to the F-16 because it's so widespread, and I actually sat in one once.

487
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:39,060
Scott: Isn't that the pointy bit at the front?

488
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:40,799
Rym: It's the basic fighter jet.

489
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,860
Scott: It has that, like, pointy needle in the front.

490
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,093
Rym: Oh yeah, with a hole in the end of it.

491
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:44,740
Scott: Yeah, that one.

492
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,477
Scott: But no, none of those are quite as cool as the SR-71 Blackbird.

493
00:26:50,518 --> 00:26:51,024
Rym: Ah, the SR-71 Blackbird.

494
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,164
Scott: Completely useless, and completely scary.

495
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:58,319
Rym: It was actually really, really useful back in the day.

496
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,454
Rym: It's just not useful now.

497
00:26:59,514 --> 00:26:59,900
Rym: It was fast.

498
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,511
Rym: It's real fast.

499
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:05,367
Rym: In fact, it's still one of the fastest planes ever made.

500
00:27:05,488 --> 00:27:07,891
Rym: Not counting the X-Series, which aren't really planes.

501
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:09,284
Rym: They're just rockets that go sideways.

502
00:27:09,325 --> 00:27:14,720
Scott: Like the scram jets and whatnot, but the X-Men got more use out of the Blackbird than the US military.

503
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:16,920
Rym: Yeah, yet they could somehow fit people.

504
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:19,180
Rym: You realize there's no cargo space in a Blackbird?

505
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,303
Scott: Yeah, yet somehow they have, like, tons of people in it, and it goes into space, and God knows what they do with this thing.

506
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:33,100
Rym: Yeah, I remember in the cartoon, because they skipped a lot in the cartoon, and at one point, like, suddenly they're all sitting on the Blackbird going into space, and then they crash.

507
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:34,048
Scott: Yeah.

508
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:35,707
Rym: And then, you know, the Dark Phoenix side.

509
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:39,220
Scott: I think they just have a really big SR-71 Blackbird on X-Men.

510
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,011
Rym: Because that works.

511
00:27:40,031 --> 00:27:46,871
Scott: But anyway, I found all of the diagrams of the SR-71 Blackbird online.

512
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,639
Rym: Let's learn how to fly one.

513
00:27:50,161 --> 00:28:03,489
Scott: I don't think we can learn how to fly one from the diagrams, but there is the best diagram that shows the instrument panels, which is every button and display and gadget and dial that the pilot sees and has access to.

514
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:04,397
Rym: Whoa, that's complicated.

515
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:05,144
Rym: Oh my God.

516
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:06,999
Scott: With, uh, labels.

517
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,937
Scott: Let's see if I can read any of these labels.

518
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,820
Scott: Temperature indicator.

519
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:14,722
Rym: Okay.

520
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:15,860
Rym: It indicates temperature.

521
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,670
Scott: Fuel and something control panel.

522
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:22,700
Rym: Alright, great.

523
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,360
Rym: Let's not read the labels.

524
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:26,578
Rym: You're not getting anywhere with this.

525
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:30,800
Scott: Throttle one something.

526
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:33,157
Rym: Anyway...

527
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,390
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of freakin' knobs on this fucker.

528
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,860
Scott: God, I couldn't fly one without, like, weeks and weeks and weeks of training.

529
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,459
Scott: God.

530
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:50,409
Scott: So, if you ever see one flying, just know that if you look at this, you'll appreciate how skilled the person flying it is.

531
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,040
Rym: You know, you do realize that there aren't any anymore.

532
00:28:54,362 --> 00:28:56,230
Rym: They were decommissioned quite some time ago.

533
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,039
Scott: There are still some.

534
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:58,619
Rym: Not that are flyable.

535
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:01,967
Rym: They're all pretty much dismantled in museums.

536
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:05,682
Scott: Oh, you can get it out of a museum and make it work.

537
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:06,873
Rym: Probably not.

538
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:07,620
Rym: Not easily.

539
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,059
Scott: Well, you know what I'm gonna do when I'm a rich man?

540
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,359
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

541
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:13,924
Rym: We'll see.

542
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:17,119
Scott: Of course, who knows if there'll be anyone left who knows how to fly it by then.

543
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,209
Rym: So, moving on, today is Tuesday.

544
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,180
Scott: Tuesday.

545
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,334
Rym: Which is video game day.

546
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,648
Scott: Video games.

547
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:28,750
Rym: And, well, it's not just video games.

548
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,415
Rym: It's also board games and, you know, gaming in general.

549
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:32,830
Scott: But we haven't played any other games.

550
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,112
Rym: Yeah, and we only have one new video game, even though I'm very pleased with it.

551
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,737
Rym: I've almost beaten it, even though I've only had it for a few days.

552
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:43,688
Rym: I picked up Final Fantasy IV Advance for the GBA.

553
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:46,845
Rym: Now, Final Fantasy IV.

554
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,288
Scott: Oh, wait, wait, wait, sorry, sorry, wait.

555
00:29:55,455 --> 00:29:58,668
Rym: Final Fantasy IV was released in the US as Final Fantasy II.

556
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:03,030
Rym: Now, we are going to use the Japanese numbering system because it makes more sense.

557
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,870
Scott: Because anyone who is using the American numbering system is an idiot who doesn't know dick about Final Fantasy.

558
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,950
Rym: Well, basically, there's Final Fantasy I, which was supposed.

559
00:30:13,132 --> 00:30:16,189
Rym: basically, it's actually, a lot of people think this is an urban myth, but it's true.

560
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,496
Rym: The company that made Final Fantasy I was going out of business.

561
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:22,070
Rym: Also, a guy was retiring.

562
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:27,407
Rym: It was called Final Fantasy because it was going to quite literally be the Final Fantasy and then they were shutting their doors.

563
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:33,369
Rym: And it did so well, they stayed in business and made eleven, twelve, fifteen more games.

564
00:30:33,814 --> 00:30:34,708
Rym: And they're still making them.

565
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:36,410
Scott: Fifteen more games?

566
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,669
Rym: Well, think, there's Final Fantasy I through XII.

567
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:45,394
Rym: There's, uh, Final Fantasy Legends 13, 14, 15.

568
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:47,704
Rym: There's Final Fantasy Adventure, though those weren't really Final Fantasy.

569
00:30:47,724 --> 00:30:48,110
Rym: That doesn't count.

570
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:49,559
Scott: That doesn't count.

571
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,950
Rym: There's Mystic Quest, which was made by, like, Square USA or something.

572
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,146
Rym: It wasn't actually made by them.

573
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,370
Scott: 16.

574
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,062
Scott: Final Fantasy X2.

575
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:56,932
Scott: 17.

576
00:30:56,932 --> 00:30:57,583
Rym: Ah, yeah.

577
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:00,409
Scott: 17 Final Fantasy games?

578
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,132
Rym: Yep.

579
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:09,251
Rym: Now, Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy III were released in Japan on the NES, and they were just sequels to Final Fantasy I. Yep.

580
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,002
Rym: They were never released in the United States on the Nintendo.

581
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:12,610
Scott: Never.

582
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:18,021
Rym: II was recently released on Dawn of Souls, which contains Final Fantasy I and II for the GBA.

583
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:18,629
Rym: Mm-hmm.

584
00:31:18,892 --> 00:31:20,290
Rym: I recommend checking that out if you want.

585
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:31,289
Rym: I recommend, honestly, not bothering with playing Final Fantasy II or III on the NES, because while they're cool games, I guess, "tease" and "arbitrary" are the two words I would use.

586
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:37,006
Scott: You know, I think we can apply those words to all Final Fantasies, but especially II and III.

587
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,396
Rym: Yeah.

588
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:39,670
Scott: And I, actually.

589
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,064
Rym: No, not I so much.

590
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:43,046
Rym: Not compared to II, III, and V. Yeah.

591
00:31:43,107 --> 00:31:45,935
Rym: V, I think, is probably the worst when it comes to tediousness.

592
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:50,098
Scott: Mm, the tediousness is the number one reason I don't play these games so much anymore.

593
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,876
Rym: Yep, but that's why you're really gonna like these re-releases, because they fix that.

594
00:31:54,118 --> 00:31:54,340
Scott: Yep.

595
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,066
Scott: Well, III is gonna be re-released for the DS in 3D.

596
00:31:57,831 --> 00:31:58,155
Rym: Yes.

597
00:31:58,358 --> 00:31:59,915
Scott: And that looks like it might be cool.

598
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:04,055
Rym: III was basically like I in terms of, it's just an "explore this cool world,".

599
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:07,755
Rym: blah blah blah, whatever, there's no real backstory to your characters, but it was a fun game.

600
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:07,816
Rym: Mm.

601
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:12,460
Rym: IV was released as II for the Super Nintendo.

602
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,368
Scott: But it's really IV.

603
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,389
Rym: Yep, and IV Advance is what I have.

604
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,528
Rym: Now, there's a funny story regarding IV, for those of you who don't know.

605
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,549
Rym: Final Fantasy IV was released in Japan in two versions.

606
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:24,789
Rym: Easy Type and Hard Type.

607
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,827
Scott: Hard Type is what Japanese people play.

608
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:27,150
Rym: Yes.

609
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:31,535
Rym: Hard Type is the actual game, and Final Fantasy IV Advance is essentially Hard Type.

610
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:42,625
Rym: Final Fantasy II, as it was called in the US, was the children's version of the game that took out most of the special abilities, most of the secrets, made the monsters ten times easier, and took out a bunch of plot.

611
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:49,835
Scott: This is because Japanese people thought Americans were stupid and we wouldn't play the game if it was as hard as Japanese people had it, so they sold us the easy one.

612
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:51,897
Rym: Yeah, that's quite literally what happened.

613
00:32:51,917 --> 00:33:07,737
Scott: Yep, so if you have only played Final Fantasy II for the, you know, American number two for the SNES, which is Final Fantasy IV, you should get this GBA version so you can, you know, play the game for real, instead of playing whatever crap game you played.

614
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:10,130
Rym: And I'll go into it in great detail in a minute.

615
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:16,585
Rym: Final Fantasy V for the Super Nintendo was not released in the US because it was incredibly difficult and strange.

616
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,937
Rym: It was just a fucker.

617
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,189
Rym: Yeah, it's real hard, and I had a lot of trouble with it.

618
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,270
Scott: And the plot really wasn't so interesting.

619
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:26,479
Rym: Yeah, IV, I mean, for those of you who played IV, that plot was kind of cool.

620
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,409
Rym: I think it would make a good movie.

621
00:33:28,312 --> 00:33:30,189
Rym: V's plot was kind of silly.

622
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,968
Scott: I don't even remember anything, or any character, because it was just...

623
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:36,270
Rym: You don't remember The Pirate Girl?

624
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:47,919
Scott: You know, I played, the non-American games I played in poorly translated ROMs during, like, one year of my life, when, uh, I think maybe, like, eight years ago.

625
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:54,587
Scott: So, they don't exactly stick in my memory so much, considering some of them I didn't even finish, because it wasn't worth it.

626
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:57,447
Scott: But VI, however...

627
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:04,909
Rym: Yep, VI, AKA Final Fantasy III in the United States, is considered by many to be the pinnacle of Final Fantasy gaming.

628
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,829
Scott: It is the pinnacle of Final Fantasy gaming.

629
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:11,168
Rym: I don't know, I like IV more, but I still respect VI as awesome.

630
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,708
Scott: VI is the bestest.

631
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,706
Rym: Yep, and then there was VII.

632
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:15,857
Scott: Everybody knows it.

633
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:17,109
Rym: VII was actually really good, too.

634
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:23,937
Rym: I mean, honestly, I hate to sound like an old crotchety man, but I really consider Final Fantasy VII to be the last true Final Fantasy.

635
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,989
Scott: I don't even consider VII to be the true Final Fantasy.

636
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:27,755
Rym: I think it is.

637
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:29,289
Rym: I think it's a logical extension of VI.

638
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:32,420
Scott: Ehh, kinda, maybe.

639
00:34:32,502 --> 00:34:32,766
Rym: Yeah.

640
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,447
Rym: Yeah, the gameplay, the way it worked out, it was basically just an extension of VI.

641
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,600
Rym: Ehh.

642
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:39,795
Rym: Just with better technology.

643
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:39,877
Rym: Ehh.

644
00:34:40,804 --> 00:34:46,409
Rym: And then Final Fantasy went, well, the thing is, after VII, Final Fantasy went in this completely other direction.

645
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:50,348
Rym: And I can't stand any of them.

646
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,710
Rym: Final Fantasy VIII was painful.

647
00:34:53,252 --> 00:34:53,962
Rym: I loved the plot.

648
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:54,893
Rym: It would have been a great movie.

649
00:34:54,914 --> 00:34:57,621
Rym: I ended up watching someone else beat it so I could see what happens.

650
00:34:57,641 --> 00:34:59,197
Rym: I just couldn't deal with that stupid game.

651
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:03,741
Scott: Man, I played the demo of VIII for the PC, 'cause I didn't have a Playstation, right?

652
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:09,256
Scott: And I was playing, and I was doing alright, and I didn't understand really what was going on, but I didn't care.

653
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:13,357
Scott: And then it said I had to use this junction to combine magics.

654
00:35:14,187 --> 00:35:15,947
Rym: And I couldn't figure out how the hell to do it.

655
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,065
Scott: It told me exactly what to do.

656
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:20,730
Scott: It was like go to this menu and do this and then push this button.

657
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:23,277
Scott: And I couldn't make this thing happen.

658
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,257
Scott: The menus were just so complicated.

659
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:28,246
Scott: In about five minutes, I gave up and I said, screw this game, it's not worth it.

660
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:33,986
Scott: Nine, I actually, someone else got nine the day it came out and I watched them play it.

661
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:45,828
Scott: And it would look better than VIII, you know, and it seemed to hearken back to previous Final Fantasies with, you know, like, the character who looked like a black mage and that sort of thing.

662
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:53,824
Scott: But it still had a lot of this tedious kind of stuff and, you know, you had to really like walk around.

663
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,762
Scott: And it wasn't like exploring like Metroid where it's interesting to find new things.

664
00:35:58,328 --> 00:36:05,521
Scott: It was like a giant place of tedious exploring, you know, and they even had stupid stuff like this card game.

665
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:10,609
Scott: you would have to play with all these people if you wanted to get these cards that gave you power or something like that.

666
00:36:11,414 --> 00:36:12,084
Scott: Just, you know, eh.

667
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:23,922
Rym: And then, you know, 10, 11 the MMO, 12 is coming out now, and apparently 12 I mean, I haven't seen much about it, but there's basically three generations of Final Fantasy fans.

668
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:27,317
Rym: There are the people like us who are like one through six, old school woot.

669
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:32,249
Rym: Then there are people who love, you know, 7, 8, 9, 10, which is fine because people are entitled to their opinions.

670
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:41,275
Scott: That's only because they were born when a Playstation was the thing and they got a Playstation as their first real system and we got an NES as our first system.

671
00:36:41,397 --> 00:36:41,619
Rym: Yup.

672
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:45,400
Rym: Think there's gonna be kids who get the Xbox 360 as their first system.

673
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:46,029
Scott: Scary.

674
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,959
Scott: Very scary.

675
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:54,629
Rym: But apparently these people are looking at 12 the way we looked at 8 as this, it's a departure that they don't like.

676
00:36:56,402 --> 00:36:56,505
Rym: Mmm.

677
00:36:56,587 --> 00:36:57,216
Rym: I'm ambivalent.

678
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:58,450
Rym: We'll see when it comes out.

679
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,639
Scott: I'm ambivalent because I haven't played Final Fantasy in years and years and years.

680
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:03,800
Rym: Yeah, we'll see if it can bring me back into the fold.

681
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,518
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if it's gonna bring me back in any fold, especially if I need a system.

682
00:37:07,538 --> 00:37:08,366
Scott: I don't have to play it.

683
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:15,194
Scott: But, um, they'd really have to do something crazy you know, to make it a game I'd wanna play.

684
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:22,304
Scott: 'Cause at this point I don't really care if they make, like, an into a dancing game or like a girly game or...

685
00:37:23,052 --> 00:37:24,189
Rym: Well there was Chocobo Racing.

686
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,676
Scott: There was?

687
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:26,670
Rym: Yeah, it's not that bad.

688
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,579
Rym: And Chocobo's Dungeon.

689
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:28,730
Scott: There was?

690
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,274
Scott: Yeah!

691
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,033
Scott: Chocobo's Dungeon sounds like some might be fun.

692
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:32,043
Scott: Is it fun?

693
00:37:32,064 --> 00:37:34,389
Rym: I actually haven't played it, but Chocobo Racing I kinda liked.

694
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,129
Scott: I have to go find those.

695
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:36,871
Scott: Yeah.

696
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:45,750
Rym: But, uh, basically, to not get off on a longer tangent about Final Fantasy, the last Final Fantasy game we really played was Crystal Chronicles.

697
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:47,984
Scott: Oh, I guess that kinda counts.

698
00:37:48,327 --> 00:37:48,630
Rym: Yeah.

699
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,208
Scott: So that ups the count of Final Fantasy games, doesn't it?

700
00:37:52,592 --> 00:37:59,868
Rym: And, just now, you know, Final Fantasy 4 Advance came out and I bought it, and I am now going to go into great detail on it, because it's the only new game we have.

701
00:38:01,475 --> 00:38:05,110
Rym: And actually, I gotta say, this is well worth buying.

702
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,530
Rym: Final Fantasy 4 Advance is fantastic.

703
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:10,750
Rym: One, it is the Japanese version.

704
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,242
Rym: It has all the complexity and all the coolness of the Japanese version.

705
00:38:14,343 --> 00:38:15,070
Rym: Nothing is spared.

706
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:30,600
Rym: In fact, the only thing that has changed between the original Japanese one and this one is that the pornography book that you can find in the developer room is called the magazine, but it still does the funny thing where the screen goes red and your character says like, "Whoa, that's my kinda

707
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:30,782
Rym: book.".

708
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:34,850
Scott: It doesn't say pornography book?

709
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,507
Rym: No, but it didn't say that in the American version either.

710
00:38:39,995 --> 00:38:40,210
Scott: Alright.

711
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,074
Rym: Yeah.

712
00:38:41,663 --> 00:38:46,589
Rym: I mean, like, they changed so much in Final Fantasy 2 America for the US.

713
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,109
Rym: And silly things.

714
00:38:48,350 --> 00:39:11,849
Rym: Like, they took out some of the romantic things, they removed a bed because they didn't want to imply the two characters were sleeping together, and in perhaps the silliest censorship ever, there's a part where Rosa, the white mage and protagonist's lover, is kidnapped by the evil guy, and she's in a chair, and there's a scythe above her head that's gonna come down and crush or kill her if you don't get to her in time.

715
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:18,907
Rym: In the American version, they decided that a scythe was too violent and they replaced it with a giant weight instead.

716
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:23,510
Scott: So it turns from serious to slapstick.

717
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,628
Rym: Yeah, the weight would have still killed her.

718
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,330
Rym: It was just a different form of violence.

719
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:29,650
Scott: Okay, great.

720
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,109
Scott: Who thinks up these things?

721
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,094
Rym: I don't know.

722
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,778
Rym: But this is not only, I mean, this is really pure.

723
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,649
Rym: Final Fantasy 4 Advance is pretty much the real deal.

724
00:39:39,192 --> 00:39:39,890
Scott: Real deal is good.

725
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,090
Scott: We don't get the real deal too often.

726
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,810
Rym: It's also a slightly updated translation, and they've added plot.

727
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:52,129
Rym: Not, like, new plot, but they've added a lot of exposition and explanations and things are a lot more clear.

728
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,434
Rym: Like, some of the plot points, if you played through the original American version, didn't make any sense.

729
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,282
Rym: Like, why are we suddenly going to this place to do this thing?

730
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:00,010
Rym: This is just silly.

731
00:40:00,591 --> 00:40:01,706
Rym: It suddenly all makes sense.

732
00:40:01,848 --> 00:40:02,353
Rym: Like, "Oh!

733
00:40:02,454 --> 00:40:03,121
Rym: Because of this and

734
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:03,363
Rym: this!".

735
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:12,816
Rym: I'm purposely avoiding spoilers, because I don't know how many people have actually played this game, but suffice to say, this translation makes the game make about a thousand percent more sense.

736
00:40:13,524 --> 00:40:16,818
Scott: Because a lot of things in that game was just like, "Oh, that's the next place to go,".

737
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:17,686
Scott: and then something happens.

738
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:22,893
Scott: And I didn't really know the characters so well when I played 2.

739
00:40:22,893 --> 00:40:23,463
Scott: You know, US2.

740
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:24,617
Rym: Yep.

741
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:27,650
Scott: Because, you know, it's like, "Okay, he's the that guy.

742
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,497
Scott: He's the that...".

743
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:31,447
Scott: You know, and they're just kind of like these stereotype shells of characters.

744
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:36,960
Scott: Not like 6, where the characters were full and you knew who they were and what they were about and all that kind of thing.

745
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,182
Rym: Yep.

746
00:40:37,506 --> 00:40:40,010
Rym: This one, you actually know a lot about the characters.

747
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,142
Rym: It really gets into it.

748
00:40:41,466 --> 00:40:45,289
Rym: You're, like, you're... I felt somewhat, like, there's a... It's pretty early in the game.

749
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,850
Rym: Basically, you are... you commit genocide.

750
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,375
Scott: Way to go, you...

751
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,304
Rym: You're a character.

752
00:40:51,547 --> 00:41:01,468
Rym: You start this game as a dark frickin' knight and you're the head of the Red Wings, which is this imperial air force for the nation of Baron, and you go around killing people and you're just pretty much a bad dude.

753
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:04,981
Scott: And... Kidnapping the president by ninjas?

754
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:05,264
Scott: Yeah.

755
00:41:05,304 --> 00:41:05,486
Rym: Yeah.

756
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,374
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

757
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:07,285
Rym: That was terrible.

758
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:07,710
Rym: Okay.

759
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:19,164
Rym: And in this game, it really goes into how bad the guy feels as he starts realizing what he's done and... I mean, I'm really trying not to spoil much, but it's a really good translation.

760
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:21,325
Scott: Yeah, the other one, the guy didn't really feel bad till after.

761
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,405
Scott: He would just kinda... It was implied, even.

762
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:24,294
Scott: He didn't say anything.

763
00:41:24,335 --> 00:41:25,224
Scott: He was just like, "Oh,

764
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:25,587
Scott: oops.".

765
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:26,274
Rym: Yeah.

766
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:27,990
Rym: The dialogue is much expanded.

767
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:28,996
Scott: That's good.

768
00:41:29,524 --> 00:41:31,529
Rym: And there's also a lot of other nice little changes.

769
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:37,529
Rym: I mean, while it's Final Fantasy 4 hard version with all the hard stuff in it, they nerfed all the bosses.

770
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,434
Scott: Hooray!

771
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:39,525
Scott: Now I won't be pissed off all the time.

772
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:40,778
Rym: Which you might think, "Oh, that sucks,".

773
00:41:40,818 --> 00:41:44,235
Rym: until you realize that the way the game is set up, you do not ever need to level.

774
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:49,750
Rym: Unless you're a nut at the end of the game when you just want to level to get all the crazy extra Uber stuff, which they've added.

775
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:51,244
Rym: You don't ever need to level.

776
00:41:51,285 --> 00:41:57,349
Rym: As long as you fight monsters as you walk around, which is kinda fun, you'll always be able to beat a boss unless you suck.

777
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:03,070
Rym: Unless you don't know how to heal or how to use ice magic on a fire guy.

778
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,639
Rym: That sort of thing.

779
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:06,862
Scott: That's good, because I always hate leveling.

780
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:08,600
Scott: As soon as I have to level, I'll just drop a game.

781
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:09,370
Rym: Yeah.

782
00:42:09,732 --> 00:42:14,154
Rym: I mean, I leveled a little bit because it's just kinda for nostalgia's sake, but you really don't need to.

783
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:20,160
Scott: I would probably level until I got pissed just to get ahead in the game, so it'd make the rest of it easier.

784
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:20,730
Rym: Yeah.

785
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,581
Rym: Now also, they've added a lot of other cool nice things.

786
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:26,418
Rym: Like, every character has a headshot.

787
00:42:26,902 --> 00:42:29,550
Rym: They redid them, and all the characters look a lot better.

788
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,854
Scott: That's good, because all the headshots always look weird, like they didn't match the character sprites.

789
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:35,230
Rym: Yeah, they've smashed a lot better.

790
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,974
Rym: And two, the thing that I thought was really cool, they only changed one character's sprites.

791
00:42:40,984 --> 00:42:42,317
Scott: Oh, they changed a sprite on someone?

792
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,690
Rym: Yes, one person.

793
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:46,576
Rym: Not the combat sprite, just the world map sprite.

794
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:49,169
Rym: Rosa, the love interest of the main character Cecil.

795
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:57,850
Rym: Now, in the original game, she's billed as she's supposed to be this incredibly beautiful woman, like known throughout the land for her beauty and grace.

796
00:42:58,813 --> 00:43:05,045
Rym: Her headshot in the original game was kinda ugly and pale, and creepy looking, and her sprite was also pale and creepy looking.

797
00:43:05,368 --> 00:43:05,449
Rym: Yep.

798
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:07,204
Rym: Her sprite is really cute.

799
00:43:07,426 --> 00:43:16,621
Rym: I'll see if I can find a picture online to post, but they changed her sprite, and it's a which I'm not gonna complain about, because I think it's a welcome change.

800
00:43:17,107 --> 00:43:17,290
Scott: Yeah.

801
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:24,577
Scott: I always hated how some of the Final Fantasy headshots in the menus look kinda weird, and freaky, like they shouldn't be.

802
00:43:24,598 --> 00:43:27,426
Rym: Have you ever looked at the art in the original Final Fantasy manuals?

803
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:28,355
Rym: They're all that way.

804
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:29,486
Scott: Yeah, it's kinda freaky.

805
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,396
Rym: Final Fantasy 4 is just the only one that went with that in the game, too.

806
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:35,143
Scott: Well, 6 kinda had it in the headshots.

807
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:36,710
Rym: Yeah, but it was the same artist.

808
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:41,650
Rym: 4 really, really went with it, though, like hardcore, but they changed it a lot in this one.

809
00:43:43,214 --> 00:43:45,850
Rym: Also, there's some new content in terms of playing the game.

810
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:52,112
Rym: One of which is there's this dungeon you can go into, and you can get like special new weapons they've added for all the characters, whatever.

811
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:54,276
Scott: Is the dungeon part of the plot, or otherwise can you just skip it?

812
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,369
Rym: You can skip it, just like there's a bunch of things you can skip in the game.

813
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:02,721
Rym: There are caves on the moon, and there are caves... oh, yeah, I just foiled something.

814
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:03,589
Rym: You can go to the moon.

815
00:44:06,494 --> 00:44:08,336
Rym: But there are things you can skip in the game.

816
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:14,090
Rym: There's a point at which the game stops being linear, and there's a whole period where you can pretty much do whatever you want and go all over the place and explore.

817
00:44:15,459 --> 00:44:17,269
Rym: And they just added a couple more things to explore.

818
00:44:18,232 --> 00:44:18,597
Scott: That's good.

819
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:20,760
Rym: But they also added something big.

820
00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:29,189
Rym: One part of Final Fantasy is that more than 50% of the characters in your party sacrifice their lives to save you at some point.

821
00:44:30,453 --> 00:44:35,145
Rym: Like, seriously, left and right, characters are like, "Oh, go ahead, don't wait for me,".

822
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:38,496
Rym: or, "Oh, I'll stop that bomb, you guys stand on that other side of the door,".

823
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:40,577
Rym: and then they die, just like left and right.

824
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:41,749
Scott: Happens all the time.

825
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:47,648
Rym: But some of the people who die, they come back later for various plot reasons.

826
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:49,769
Rym: Not like silly reasons, but actual reasons.

827
00:44:50,511 --> 00:44:52,070
Rym: It's not just completely silly and arbitrary.

828
00:44:52,876 --> 00:44:58,698
Rym: But the thing is, you find them again in the game, but all you do in the game originally was talk to them again.

829
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,929
Rym: Maybe you get an item from them.

830
00:45:00,512 --> 00:45:04,250
Rym: In this game, once you find a guy again, you can swap people in and out of your party.

831
00:45:05,698 --> 00:45:08,457
Scott: Oh, so someone dies, but you really like having them in your party?

832
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,309
Scott: Well, you can get them back.

833
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,182
Rym: Only if there's someone who doesn't die permanently.

834
00:45:11,223 --> 00:45:12,190
Rym: Some people die permanently.

835
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:12,632
Scott: Ah.

836
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:16,235
Rym: So you can use those twins from Mesidia.

837
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,840
Rym: if you don't like using Cain or Rydia or whatever.

838
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,749
Rym: You can swap people out.

839
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:20,696
Rym: That's good.

840
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:21,810
Rym: Which I thought was neat.

841
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,830
Rym: It adds kind of a fun element to the end of the game.

842
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,130
Rym: Like, can you beat the game with that crappy bard?

843
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:27,093
Scott: No.

844
00:45:28,877 --> 00:45:29,329
Scott: He's crappy.

845
00:45:30,051 --> 00:45:37,630
Rym: Oh, and while the translation is very, very, very accurate and cool now, they left one of the inaccuracies from the original English translation in on purpose.

846
00:45:38,771 --> 00:45:40,701
Rym: Tella still calls Edward a "spoony

847
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:41,125
Rym: bard."

848
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,190
Rym: That was, uh... That was a gross mistranslation that was left in because it's so well known.

849
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:48,599
Scott: Okay.

850
00:45:48,906 --> 00:45:49,070
Rym: Yeah.

851
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:53,050
Scott: Uh... What was the original translation say?

852
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:54,159
Rym: I don't know.

853
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:55,470
Rym: Don't even ask me that.

854
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,428
Scott: 'Cause that sounds right to me.

855
00:45:57,591 --> 00:46:01,870
Rym: Yeah, it was something in Japanese, and they translate... They took a lot of liberties in the English translation.

856
00:46:02,153 --> 00:46:05,610
Scott: Well, they kind of have to when they're limited by, you know, the number of characters they can write.

857
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:20,030
Rym: Yeah, 'cause you gotta understand, a lot of these old translations for NES and SNES games, especially the ROMs, even more than, like, the official releases, you couldn't just translate into different texts because you were limited as to how many characters you could have in any given conversation.

858
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:30,190
Scott: So the original Japanese, someone said, like, a hundred, you know, characters' worth of text, then in English, all you had was a hundred characters' worth of text for them to say something.

859
00:46:30,493 --> 00:46:37,610
Rym: And they could, like, they could use tricks and add more or less characters sometimes, but they were still limited, so it was very difficult to translate things so they would fit.

860
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:41,229
Rym: This version of the game doesn't have that problem, so the translation is very good.

861
00:46:43,777 --> 00:46:57,129
Rym: And I guess one last thing, this might bother some people, or you might not notice, I only notice because it's my favorite Final Fantasy, I'm kind of a nut, but the GBA, for whatever reason, they didn't, they removed a lot of the 3D effects from the game.

862
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:07,493
Rym: There were just a lot of, like, 3D missed effects over certain areas of maps, or there'd be a 3D, like, crevice in holes that you'd walk by and it would scale as you walked around them.

863
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,109
Rym: They took all that out.

864
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:16,381
Scott: See, I don't get that, because Golden Sun has all that kind of crazy stuff going on all over the place, and that's a GBA game, it doesn't have a problem.

865
00:47:16,563 --> 00:47:19,249
Rym: See, I think it's because Golden Sun was made for the GBA.

866
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:21,654
Rym: So they used all the GBA tricks.

867
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:26,442
Rym: This game was made for the Super Nintendo, used all the Super Nintendo tricks.

868
00:47:26,503 --> 00:47:32,300
Scott: Do you really think they just put an SNES emulator on the cartridge and put the ROM in there and then modified the ROM and that was that?

869
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:35,250
Scott: You really don't think that they recoded it for the GBA?

870
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,130
Rym: I don't know, if they recoded it for the GBA they didn't do it crazily.

871
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,089
Rym: Maybe they were limited by memory, I don't know.

872
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:46,786
Scott: Yeah, maybe they tried to make the game cheaper by putting it on a less memory GBA cartridge.

873
00:47:46,806 --> 00:47:51,529
Rym: Because Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI did push the SNES in a number of ways.

874
00:47:52,051 --> 00:47:53,941
Scott: Well, anything that used Mode 7 was pushing it.

875
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:54,409
Scott: Yeah.

876
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,046
Scott: Mode 7 is kind of like when people use that brand new feature on the video card.

877
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:00,430
Scott: that's only in the newest DirectX.

878
00:48:01,973 --> 00:48:04,588
Scott: You know, and no one can get a good frame rate no matter what card they have.

879
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:06,180
Scott: That's what Mode 7 was.

880
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:06,281
Scott: Yep.

881
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,187
Rym: But I guess, kind of to wrap this up, in conclusion, blah blah blah.

882
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:16,522
Rym: One, if you've never played an old school Final Fantasy pick this game up.

883
00:48:16,683 --> 00:48:28,582
Scott: Oh yeah, if you're one of those people where the first system you had was like PlayStation, and the first Final Fantasy you remember was Final Fantasy VII, and you think that's like the best game ever and whatever, you gotta play this right now.

884
00:48:28,683 --> 00:48:32,339
Scott: Get a GBA SP or DS or something and play this.

885
00:48:32,722 --> 00:48:34,358
Scott: Because then you'll realize "Oh!

886
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:35,955
Scott: I was wrong!

887
00:48:35,975 --> 00:48:36,984
Scott: I've been living in a

888
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:37,550
Scott: dreamland!".

889
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:40,829
Rym: Or maybe, in the very least, you can see kind of where these games came from.

890
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:41,633
Rym: Yeah.

891
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:47,309
Rym: Like this, I mean, this is one of the classic Final Fantasy games, and this is a very very good implementation of it.

892
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:50,950
Rym: that removes a lot of the tedium that early, early Final Fantasy games had.

893
00:48:51,953 --> 00:49:00,629
Scott: Yeah, because I notice a lot of people might, you know, a lot of people like VII will go back and they'll try to play VI or IV or something, you know, and someone tells them that that's the real deal.

894
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:14,889
Scott: But then, things that, gameplay things that have been fixed in the newer ones like VII, VIII, IX, that still existed back then will piss the people off to no end, and no matter how good the game is otherwise they'll still be all "eh" on it.

895
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:21,689
Scott: So this GBA one can help fix that, and you'll realize, you know, that the games didn't suck.

896
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:27,470
Rym: And two, if you've played all those old games and you like Final Fantasy IV you have no excuse not to pick this up.

897
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,003
Rym: This is fantastic.

898
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,529
Rym: I am reliving my childhood through this game.

899
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:33,209
Scott: Uh, good for you.

900
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:33,331
Scott: Let

901
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:43,729
Rym: me put it this way, for those of you who have actually played the game I picked it up last Friday, and I didn't play it that much over the weekend because I was busy doing various things and we had a friend over and we were doing all this stuff.

902
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:51,770
Rym: But basically, I am already at the point where I'm going to go into the sealed cave and get that last crystal.

903
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:54,126
Rym: Yeah.

904
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:56,368
Scott: That's quite a ways.

905
00:49:57,631 --> 00:49:59,090
Rym: So, that's all we got for today.

906
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,429
Rym: Kind of peter out here, we only had one game.

907
00:50:02,511 --> 00:50:03,409
Scott: It was the Final Fantasy.

908
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:12,900
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

909
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,499
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

910
00:50:16,383 --> 00:50:16,999
