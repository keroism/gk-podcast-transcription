1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,449
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday April 13th.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,512
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:14,800
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:20,399
Rym: Tonight we review the battle for Wesnoth an amazing turn-based strategy game for the PC.

5
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:22,778
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:29,357
Rym: This is a very momentous occasion for GeekNights for you see on another show.

7
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:35,060
Rym: indirectly We have probably received what I would call our first actual legitimate hate mail ever.

8
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:46,859
Scott: Well, I mean, I think we've gotten things before that they weren't like they might have been considered hate mail But no one was actually really hating us or we weren't a hundred percent sure that they were not kidding.

9
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:54,680
Rym: and well There was that one that started out Okay, but then it went a little weird at the end and there was that Admiral beefy or whatever his name is thing.

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,452
Rym: But if that was actually real I feel sorry for that, dude.

11
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:02,282
Scott: Yeah, that dude's a scary, dude Gary.

12
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:03,954
Rym: uh, this is not the.

13
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:04,860
Rym: I'd like to play a clip.

14
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:09,580
Rym: We're not gonna talk about this tonight since it's Tuesday and it has nothing to do with video games at all.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,033
Scott: I don't even know why we're playing it tonight.

16
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:11,700
Scott: That's all Rym.

17
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:21,499
Rym: Well, I thought that it was hilarious and furthermore to make sure that you get the entirety of the hilarity I edited out everything but the actual craziness from the response.

18
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:25,433
Rym: We got to a fairly innocent question that Scott asked a fellow podcaster.

19
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:27,280
Rym: There are multiple questions.

20
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:32,880
Media: Do you think that if I concentrate hard enough I could kill him with the power of my mind?

21
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:37,620
Media: The thing is like his email is stupid for reasons that have nothing to do with the fact that it's not.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:45,940
Media: It doesn't take all our fucking powers combined because this is such a retarded question that no any one of us could answer this.

23
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:51,117
Media: Even if it was shoujo, you would still be a condescending sexist asshole.

24
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:56,379
Media: Oh It's straight-up sci-fi So it couldn't possibly be shoujo.

25
00:01:57,163 --> 00:02:01,720
Media: You don't want to say that a shoujo work could be on par with Tezuka.

26
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:11,103
Media: I think Hagio moto, you know the female Tezuka as she's referred to you would have something to fucking say about that First off.

27
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:13,392
Media: Do you have any idea what shoujo means?

28
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:15,100
Media: you have any idea with these?

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,026
Media: Classifications mean in Japan.

30
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:20,499
Media: She's one of the women who helped to fucking define shoujo.

31
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:23,170
Media: God how insulting is this?

32
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:31,302
Media: Like I just can't get over how Dismissive this email is of shoujo manga Insinuating that.

33
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:36,134
Media: oh, how could such a solid sci-fi series possibly be a girl's manga?

34
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:41,599
Media: and that kind of as if to imply that Only guys girls can't write sci-fi.

35
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:46,298
Media: You know, it doesn't excuse the stupidity of this email.

36
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,060
Media: Oh What that's retarded.

37
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,447
Media: There's no words for how retarded that is.

38
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:55,380
Media: And I guess it pisses me off more because like this is GeekNights.

39
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:03,822
Media: I mean these guys do a podcast Where they talk about anime and you guys are always boasting about how much you know Mr.

40
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:06,289
Media: Z. We ran the RIT anime club.

41
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,237
Media: So our otaku cock is the biggest.

42
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:10,240
Media: what now?

43
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:12,177
Media: No, I'm not cool with this.

44
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:16,379
Rym: If that's the kind of hate mail we get I'm all for it.

45
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,952
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I don't know what.

46
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:20,319
Scott: what her problem is.

47
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:21,885
Rym: She figured out our secret.

48
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:24,415
Rym: if anything our otaku cock is in fact that big.

49
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:25,820
Rym: she must have spied it from space.

50
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:27,437
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

51
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:29,705
Rym: Well, there was that eclipse.

52
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:32,799
Scott: Maybe she was just getting pissed off at it poking her in the eye.

53
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:40,188
Scott: Anyway anyway It's video games right all games in general.

54
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:40,569
Scott: Yeah.

55
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:47,564
Scott: Yeah, so if you haven't heard the Xbox 360 Elite is Coming out now.

56
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:50,313
Rym: this really really reeks of ultra FARC.

57
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,200
Scott: Why was it Rico of ultra FARC?

58
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,576
Rym: Well in terms of people always joke about how stratified FARC is at least people in FARC how there's FARC.

59
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:12,479
Rym: and then there's the people Who are so rich and beyond that they can afford the five bucks a month or whatever to get that little total FARC icon next To their name even though I've been tempted to buy it a couple times Mostly because it also gives you the ability on FARC to block people.

60
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:17,581
Scott: Well this Xbox 360 elite is an Xbox 360.

61
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:23,320
Scott: It's gonna be out on April 29th, and it's a bit different from the Xbox 360s that are currently available.

62
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,285
Rym: So it's not just a money grab.

63
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:26,849
Scott: no not really well.

64
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:27,230
Scott: Yes.

65
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,513
Scott: No it depends.

66
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:32,808
Scott: first of all it's black Opposed to me.

67
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:39,280
Rym: wait so it's you mean It's the same color as the original Xbox or all the consoles from the previous generation except the Gamecube?

68
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:44,489
Scott: Yeah, it's basically Color of the old Xbox shape of the new Xbox.

69
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:51,848
Rym: I always thought it was interesting how everything kind of went white and now Microsoft's like oh check this out black.

70
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:52,891
Scott: It's pretty much.

71
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:55,759
Scott: people only know how to do industrial design with two colors.

72
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:02,562
Scott: these days It's white and black and either the you know they'll do white as the default and then the special one is black You know.

73
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:06,899
Scott: and meanwhile before it was black was normal and the special one is white.

74
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:10,572
Scott: It's like what the hell just it's just the color.

75
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:11,395
Scott: it doesn't mean anything.

76
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:13,928
Rym: well, I'm seeing this in cars lately I'm looking at cars.

77
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:19,560
Rym: just because my current car might Positively be honest last legs I got to see how much it's gonna cost to fix part of the cool.

78
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,468
Rym: It's just but all the cars.

79
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:22,031
Rym: I looked at.

80
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:25,067
Rym: I went to a bunch of dealers that were around 90%.

81
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,979
Rym: of them are either white black or gray.

82
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,037
Scott: Yeah, actually when I was buying my current car there was like a selection of like 10 to 12 colors.

83
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:33,798
Scott: You could pick for the car.

84
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:42,791
Scott: But like two of them like I remember one of them was like this pearl white something that cost more than the other colors And I'm like what the hell is just it's just a different color.

85
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,980
Scott: What why are you charging more for one color?

86
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,671
Rym: Yeah, it's not like you're buying the gold-plated Mazda 3 should cost.

87
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:51,180
Scott: shouldn't the engine be the part that cost more anyway?

88
00:05:52,021 --> 00:06:00,818
Scott: also this elite Xbox 360 will have a 120 gigabyte hard drive uh-huh which is that's actually a good thing.

89
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:05,500
Scott: because Well Xbox is right now don't have big enough hard drives.

90
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:13,526
Scott: so when people download all this extra stuff and they play a lot of games and they start downloading videos and Demos they run out of room real quick

91
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:20,770
Rym: especially since this whole xlive download stuff thing is going really well And I got to say I applaud Microsoft for their efforts.

92
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:21,734
Scott: secondly.

93
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:22,839
Scott: They're adding in well.

94
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:25,185
Scott: thirdly I guess they're adding an HDMI port.

95
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:27,632
Scott: so you don't have to use component cables for HD.

96
00:06:27,672 --> 00:06:30,279
Scott: you can use the HDMI cable for HD.

97
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:42,460
Scott: Aha I'm of the mind that I I'm not a hundred percent sure that there is no difference in the visual quality when using a component cable versus an HDMI cable.

98
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:46,960
Scott: But I'm pretty sure that the majority of people could not tell the difference in a double-blind.

99
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:49,139
Rym: I'd really like to see some double blinds.

100
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:58,152
Rym: I remember double blinds from the audiophile people who couldn't tell the difference between some super-leet audio file awesome Gold cable system and a 1989 boombox.

101
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:06,200
Scott: Yep Also this Xbox 360 is four hundred and eighty dollars.

102
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,029
Scott: Aha So what this is done?

103
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:18,505
Scott: really I mean if you think about it It's not that much better than the Xbox 360 premium Which is like three hundred dollars.

104
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:21,212
Scott: right because I mean what does it have?

105
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,860
Scott: it has HDMI hole which isn't a significant difference.

106
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:26,260
Scott: It has a significantly larger hard drive.

107
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:39,507
Scott: But that hard drive is going to be available separately for a hundred and eighty dollars Which basically if you bought an Xbox 360 premium and the hard drive it would cost just as much as the elite 360

108
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:42,679
Rym: but then you also get the HDMI port and you don't have to have this extra thing.

109
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:48,034
Scott: Now the problem that everyone's complaining about is of course the things this elite doesn't have.

110
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:51,386
Scott: first of all it doesn't have that HD DVD drive built in.

111
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:57,633
Scott: it has just the regular drive, so you still need that external HD DVD drive to watch the HD DVD movies with it.

112
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:05,625
Scott: it doesn't have Freaking wireless internet, so you still have to connect it to the internet with a cable which granted That's the number one complaint.

113
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:11,953
Rym: granted for us at least the Wii by default only comes with wireless And I'd rather it just had an ethernet hole so I could plug it in.

114
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:12,878
Scott: I don't know.

115
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,232
Scott: wireless I think is better because it increases a lot of play in your house.

116
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:19,620
Scott: I mean most people don't have a wire.

117
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,870
Rym: Oh, yeah, I agree for not.

118
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,437
Rym: for 99% of people the wireless is bad right.

119
00:08:23,618 --> 00:08:32,299
Scott: also If you're going places with your system, which you tend to do with the game console these days It's you're not gonna be able to get a wire near your system.

120
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,344
Scott: You're gonna need to use a wireless like a hotel or something.

121
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:48,279
Scott: so wireless these days at least is generally better than wired and having wired only on the 360 really Means that a lot of people are not gonna be able to use the Xbox Live and we're not using the Xbox Live.

122
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:49,263
Scott: why buy An Xbox?

123
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:56,000
Rym: see I say for us mostly because we happen to have a switch Sitting next to the TV that really wants to be used by more than one day.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,038
Scott: Yeah, just because we're geeks and we have a cable down there.

125
00:09:00,002 --> 00:09:01,848
Scott: See what's happening here actually is.

126
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:04,196
Scott: a lot of people are seeing this and they're saying all right.

127
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:08,649
Scott: first of all that hard drive is way overpriced 120 gigs for $180.

128
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,655
Scott: you could buy a better hard drive than that at the store.

129
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:14,272
Rym: for a PC you can buy a 750 gigabyte hard drive for like 120.

130
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:17,979
Scott: by granted This is a two and a half inch hard drive and not a three and a half inch.

131
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,909
Scott: But that's not that big a deal these days that anymore.

132
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,356
Scott: the thing is this is four hundred eighty dollars.

133
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,821
Scott: a ps3 is $600.

134
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:28,290
Rym: well the high-end ps3 what about the low-end ps3?

135
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:31,659
Scott: low and ps3 is about the same as this thing, huh?

136
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,594
Scott: So it actually kind of makes the ps3 look okay.

137
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:51,039
Scott: Yeah I mean what they should have done is they should have brought this out and charge the same amount of money for this as they charge for the high-end Xbox 360 and then lower the prices on the other 360s that already exist then they wouldn't make the ps3 look so good.

138
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:59,565
Rym: But then again while the ps3 is looking a little better now that little big world which is perhaps the only game I have seen that well I'm not gonna buy a ps3.

139
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:05,437
Rym: if I were the kind of person who could be swayed to buy a ps3 That game would have done it.

140
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:24,199
Scott: Yeah The PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 1 had all sorts of great games, and it looks like even though Developers you know are not so hip to the ps3 as they were There's still gonna be a whole bunch of awesome type games for it probably in the long run But it's just not worth the money at least not right now.

141
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:41,620
Rym: Yeah especially since there has been a lot of talk that IBM and other companies have been refining the manufacturing process of the cell chip and While not in the near future so no one who really wants a ps3 can worry about it in the long run the ps3 is Going to get a lot cheaper like every piece of technology in the history of technology.

142
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,907
Scott: Yeah, I mean when I'm 30 something years old.

143
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,432
Scott: I'll probably be able to get a ps3 for like $100.

144
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:51,595
Rym: granted look at us We're now bulking it paying nothing to get a ps2.

145
00:10:51,635 --> 00:11:02,036
Rym: yeah Granted part of that is that if we get a ps2 we're gonna play guitar heroes, and if we play guitar heroes We're not gonna have any time to do anything else in our lives for at least a month.

146
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:07,575
Scott: probably not Yeah, so Xbox 360 elite is really not that elite.

147
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:09,140
Scott: and the other thing is the head.

148
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:10,619
Scott: It's comes with that with the headset.

149
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:14,789
Scott: You know you can talk to people But it comes with a wired headset instead of the wireless one.

150
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:16,114
Scott: ah it's like what.

151
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:20,949
Scott: if you're gonna make the elite Why don't you give it like with everything?

152
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,417
Scott: give people a full set of controllers.

153
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:24,300
Scott: give people?

154
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,264
Scott: Four wireless headsets.

155
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:30,496
Scott: give people the HDTV drive the biggest hard drive the best everything.

156
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:31,719
Scott: make it the full set.

157
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,925
Rym: well You know what they're probably gonna.

158
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:34,653
Scott: Do charge the same amount of money.

159
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:44,260
Rym: There was the Xbox now And then there's gonna be the Xbox complete, and it's gonna have everything and it's gonna cost slightly more than the elite costs.

160
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:44,882
Scott: I don't know.

161
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,710
Scott: I don't even know why they bother like.

162
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:48,859
Rym: oh, I know why because people are gonna buy it.

163
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:51,605
Rym: They're gonna make money off of this They're gonna make a lot of money.

164
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,168
Scott: because I don't know.

165
00:11:52,489 --> 00:12:01,032
Scott: it seems to think the news is saying At least the word on the internet switches completely unreliable is like Hardcore people aren't liking the elite.

166
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:02,320
Scott: They're all complaining about it.

167
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:03,607
Rym: Well that is the one issue.

168
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,458
Rym: hardcore people already own an Xbox.

169
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:12,400
Scott: yes But the PD word is also that you know if hardcore people don't buy it Then there won't be the trickling down to the non hardcore people.

170
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,337
Scott: I don't know.

171
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:22,655
Scott: I think people who don't care about how much money it costs and don't have a 360 already will probably buy the elite one just for the bigger hard drive.

172
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:28,479
Scott: and You know if you have an HDMI TV by the HDMI port you might as well use it.

173
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,504
Scott: It's not gonna hurt you.

174
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:36,950
Rym: plus regardless of the possible future potential of the ps3 Right now the Xbox has a lot more to offer.

175
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:42,231
Rym: so even if you pay this premium for the Xbox Which is comparable to the price for a low-end ps3.

176
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,240
Rym: I think you get a lot more out of the deal.

177
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:46,993
Scott: Yeah, you definitely get something for it, but it's still.

178
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:48,480
Scott: they're giving you their shorthand.

179
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,120
Rym: And I also think it doesn't cost Microsoft very much more to make this thing and I imagine every one They sell is pure profit.

180
00:12:56,803 --> 00:13:02,044
Scott: Probably so if you want one April 29 $480.

181
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:13,916
Rym: so there's been a lot of buzz about the PSP lately which has also been really surprising because the PSP was launched and Almost a long time ago fell flat and its sales were absolutely nothing compared to the DS.

182
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:17,880
Rym: even the early days of the DS It was just selling like hotcakes relative.

183
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:25,039
Rym: And then UMD failed and there weren't any games for the PSP and a lot of the mainstream gaming press kind of forgot about it.

184
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:34,647
Rym: Recently the PSP while it's definitely not doing well went from an also ran to a doing kind of okay Gonna be a decent second place.

185
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:41,144
Scott: as soon as they stopped paying attention to those stupid UMD crap movie things And they just said all right Let's make some games.

186
00:13:41,224 --> 00:13:47,126
Scott: for this turns out that some people actually made some games for the PSP And there's quite a few of them out there.

187
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:48,531
Rym: Yeah, if I owned a PSP.

188
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:50,578
Rym: I'd probably buy three or four games.

189
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,440
Scott: right now It's like I look at that PSP shelf, and I see some good stuff there.

190
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:59,733
Rym: It's almost like Sony realized that Everything they had done for the past couple years had been an abortion.

191
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:02,919
Rym: so they decided all right Let's do a couple things smart.

192
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,934
Rym: Let's make a game called little big planet, and let's make games for the PSP.

193
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,972
Rym: and now this is the news Let's lower the price of the PSP.

194
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:15,686
Rym: 30 bucks all right $170 is not that bad.

195
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:17,672
Scott: It's only 40 more than a DS.

196
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:28,277
Rym: Yeah, that's what I'm saying cuz the PSP while it doesn't have the nearly the Library that the DS has the PSP does have the fact that you can listen to podcasts on it.

197
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:29,180
Scott: you can download.

198
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:36,986
Scott: It's the only thing that I've heard of the only reasonable reasonably available Common device that you can get.

199
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:41,639
Scott: they can subscribe to and download and listen to podcasts all in one portable device.

200
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:52,933
Rym: also There is some fantastic NES Emulators for the PSP and in fact everyone I've ever met who had a PSP Proudly showed me their NES emulator and their giant pile of ROMs.

201
00:14:53,174 --> 00:15:12,947
Scott: another thing I've noticed about the PSP Is that they've realized I guess a lot of people who own it like you know the old-school games And they've been releasing a lot of PSP games that are just rehashes or remixes Or you know just rereleases of older games like there's some Castlevania action on there And there's a Mega Man action on there.

202
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:13,188
Rym: Well.

203
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:17,299
Rym: They must have seen how well Nintendo is doing by selling Mario 1 to me again.

204
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:20,940
Rym: Plus imagine this and this is total speculation.

205
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:43,470
Rym: I don't think Nintendo will actually do it because we all know that Nintendo only does things if they make a lot of money off of it, but Imagine if Nintendo coupled the fact that the Wii can download stuff with the DS and say you could pay to get I don't know Mario 1 in your Wii And then you can do the download demo play and get Mario 1 in your DS until you turn it off like they do with demos.

206
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:47,877
Rym: now That would be an absolutely killer app for a lot of people.

207
00:15:48,118 --> 00:16:02,360
Scott: yep Yeah But I think what's happening with the PSP is the same thing that we're seeing on the Wii and the same thing we kind of Saw on the DS is that the game development industry is becoming ridiculously risk-averse.

208
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:06,669
Scott: They don't want to take any risks Especially since it costs way too much to develop a game.

209
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,320
Scott: even a DS game costs a reasonable amount of money to develop Even if you don't have to pay Nintendo a lot of money.

210
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,160
Rym: Yeah, and a few people took a bath on the n-gauge.

211
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:23,452
Scott: Yes, so no one wants to develop a game and have it be for a system That isn't gonna sell or make a game that has no chance of selling.

212
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:26,755
Scott: so when a system is new no matter What system it is?

213
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,180
Scott: Nobody wants to make a game for it that cost any amount of money.

214
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:35,716
Scott: They'll make a cheap game for it Which is why the PSP came out and there were just crap games.

215
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:37,227
Scott: a DS came out There's tech demos.

216
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:46,611
Scott: we came out just tech demos Because no one wants to pay You know and make a huge investment and develop a real game For a system that just came out or isn't even out yet.

217
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,559
Scott: You have no idea how well that system is gonna do.

218
00:16:49,181 --> 00:17:02,505
Scott: so I think from here on out unless suddenly games become cheaper easier to develop or You know people stop buying games that cost so much to develop and maybe game developers and publishers Want to take some risks

219
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:03,348
Rym: you're

220
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:18,859
Scott: always gonna see a new console come out no matter what console it is Not have any games for it for quite a while and unless a lot of people buy the console and buy the tech demos for It then and only then will you actually see the real games come out.

221
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:29,982
Rym: But then if consumers are smart you have this chicken-egg scenario where I won't buy a ps3 until there's good games for the ps3 And the developers won't make good games the ps3 until I buy a ps3 Exactly.

222
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:33,854
Scott: and the only way this cycle of doom is gonna stop is either.

223
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:40,054
Scott: if we keep buying Consoles that don't have good games for them publishers decide to take some risks.

224
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:42,060
Scott: games become cheaper to develop.

225
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:43,509
Scott: I don't know.

226
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:49,940
Rym: I think in the immediate term This is actually slightly beneficial to gamers, and this is some roundabout logic here.

227
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,562
Rym: But think of this.

228
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:57,340
Rym: the only people who buy a console at launch are the people who are hardcore about gaming in sorry babe.

229
00:17:57,802 --> 00:18:00,916
Rym: Yes, well, but the ps3 was mostly eBay as we learn.

230
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:06,797
Rym: but for the DS I mean the average gamer wasn't just gonna buy a DS an opening day because there was nothing for it.

231
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:07,580
Rym: nothing at all.

232
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,794
Rym: But people like me and Scott when I bought the DS to me.

233
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:12,260
Rym: I was voting with my dollars.

234
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:20,777
Rym: I was saying I'm going to put forth X money Because I believe that X money is worth faith that this console is going to be worth it to me someday.

235
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:33,503
Rym: and by buying it Now I am giving it my vote And I think at least aside from the ps3 People who buy a console ahead of time like that are voting for that console and all the potential of that console whether they realize It or not now.

236
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:41,499
Rym: the ps2 didn't have to worry about that because the ps2 had so much momentum from the ps1 that Developers just jumped on it immediately because it was a sure thing.

237
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:44,960
Scott: Yeah, the thing is with this voting is that it's not free voting.

238
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,195
Scott: It's one thing if you go to the election booth and you vote for someone for president.

239
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,280
Scott: They don't I agree.

240
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,254
Scott: It's definitely a vote with six hundred dollars, and then you lose.

241
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:55,040
Scott: you just lost six hundred dollars.

242
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,063
Scott: It got nothing for it.

243
00:18:56,123 --> 00:18:56,344
Rym: Yes.

244
00:18:56,404 --> 00:18:56,584
Rym: Hence.

245
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:00,456
Rym: The only people who vote are people who are rich confident or stupid.

246
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:05,931
Scott: Oh well, maybe one day our Answers will come.

247
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:17,339
Rym: yep, though I also think Nintendo is one of the few companies that has the really really Prime position to take this cycle and break it with consoles if they were just hit with more first-party games early on.

248
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:29,140
Scott: I also think another good solution which is sort of falls into the Lower your development cost solution is when you make a game make the game and then just make more of the game.

249
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:37,090
Scott: You don't need everyone freaking updates their engine and as the graphics and everything just make Ten more levels and put out the same game again.

250
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,756
Scott: We don't care if your game was good.

251
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:39,860
Scott: We want more.

252
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:42,950
Scott: It's like looking like half-life 2. they just made more levels.

253
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,432
Scott: I bought it.

254
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:45,559
Scott: You know, what other games is that DDR?

255
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,290
Scott: They just make more songs.

256
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:48,036
Scott: we buy it.

257
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:57,930
Rym: Yep Guitar heroes definitely has that infinite product cycle of constantly buying new versions because there's always something new And you don't have to do anything to the game because the game already exists.

258
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:03,580
Scott: Yeah, maybe we release old games That people can't find anymore.

259
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:07,553
Scott: Yeah, take games that are already made in other countries and already profitable.

260
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:08,957
Scott: just translate them and sell them.

261
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:11,447
Rym: with Nintendo I see I mean with the GameCube.

262
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:21,910
Rym: they hit us right away with Smash Brothers Melee, which Effectively the GameCube was a Smash Brothers Melee machine for a long time after most people bought it And I think that that drove a lot of sales.

263
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:23,880
Rym: the first party games that hit right away.

264
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:28,838
Rym: I think they hit right away because the GameCube wasn't really positioned very well, especially after the n64.

265
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:30,344
Scott: That is something else.

266
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:45,320
Scott: is that the GameCube while it hit pretty poorly it did hit with like Two first party games the Luigi's Mansion, which wasn't so good but it was still a first party game that people hadn't played and The Smash Brothers and then a little while later came the Metroid Prime.

267
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:48,351
Scott: So it's really three first party games right away.

268
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:51,080
Scott: The Wii still has really only one.

269
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:53,520
Scott: I don't even want to count anything other than Zelda.

270
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,883
Rym: Yeah but I'd wait trucks.

271
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,150
Rym: okay the reason that it's different here?

272
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,660
Rym: because Nintendo could have hit with the Wii and they might even been planning to But notice how they pushed off some dates for games and things.

273
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:17,040
Rym: Yeah I think that because the Wii is still selling solely on the virtue of Wii Sports and the fact that it's oh, yeah I mean Wii Sports single-handedly is selling I'd say currently if not the majority at least a significant percentage of probably all of them.

274
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,346
Rym: Yeah, well because all the gamers who bought one already bought one, but all the grandmas who want to bowl and play tennis They're selling like hotcakes.

275
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,696
Scott: It's basically a bowling and tennis machine.

276
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:28,005
Scott: as far as they're concerned They're never gonna buy another game for.

277
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:38,480
Rym: so I've said this before but Nintendo is gonna wait and I'll bet pretty much as we sale Slack the pressure they put to make first party games come out is going to increase directly proportional.

278
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,676
Scott: Well, well super paper Mario comes out.

279
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:46,514
Scott: I think next week I'm excited about super paper Mario because why that's a pre-order that Amazon.

280
00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:48,160
Scott: Oh, you better get to that.

281
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:49,004
Scott: I think I will.

282
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:49,226
Scott: I got.

283
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,854
Scott: I'll get a pre-order all the video games.

284
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:52,463
Scott: actually probably this weekend I don't know.

285
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:59,291
Rym: ever since I started playing some Smash Brothers melee again recently I'm feeling the new Smash Brothers real hardcore.

286
00:21:59,311 --> 00:21:59,832
Scott: It's not gonna.

287
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:02,280
Scott: they haven't dated that or showed us anything other than solids.

288
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,680
Rym: No, no, no, no, but I'm more excited about this game that I've been about any game since Twilight Princess.

289
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:18,278
Rym: Yeah, yeah, well not counting PC games Things of the day.

290
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:20,390
Rym: so Scott and Alex had both been it.

291
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,450
Rym: Well Scott more so than anyone been on this tower defense game kick for a while.

292
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,820
Scott: Yeah, I played pretty much every free tower defense game on the Internet's.

293
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:31,777
Rym: I resisted this mostly due to the fact that every tower defense Game I saw sucked ass.

294
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,470
Scott: Well, some of them were good some of them better than others.

295
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,220
Scott: Some of them did suck ass in general.

296
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,609
Scott: It's sort of one of those game genres where it's either Playable or unplayable.

297
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:48,501
Rym: Yeah, well plus I don't really have time to play flash games at work Like I might have at other jobs I've had.

298
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:49,809
Rym: so I really just didn't play him.

299
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:57,608
Rym: but Alex started getting into him and we started playing this one in the living room and What was originally going to be a German board gaming night?

300
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:05,810
Rym: Ended up with us sitting there for like an hour or two Each of us on a computer in the same room not talking playing the stupid tower defense game.

301
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:25,876
Scott: This one is actually a lot better than a lot of the others because in other tower defense games Generally, there's a path that the enemies follow and at one end they come in the other end they come out and you put your towers in between the path and Try to position them to do the most damage to the bad guys as they fuck go along the merry way And you don't let them.

302
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,710
Scott: you want to kill them before they get off the map.

303
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:35,550
Rym: now see the basic idea of a tower defense game is kind of a genre of gaming is You've got a thing and you want to protect it from other things that are coming to get it.

304
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:44,090
Scott: yes, you allocate resources into damage dealing things and then position them so that you get the most out of them and therefore you most.

305
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:49,590
Scott: You try to spend your resources to most efficiently get as much damage as possible.

306
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:58,770
Rym: Well this game called desktop tower defense probably is the best tower defense game out there And if anyone knows of one better, I implore you to share it with everyone in the forums.

307
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:05,890
Rym: This game has enough variety in enemies and in structures to keep you interested pretty much the whole way through.

308
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:17,490
Rym: Yep It has a very unique setup where you build your structures and not only do the structures attack the enemies in different ways But the structures themselves form the path that the enemies follow.

309
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:28,173
Scott: Yes If you don't if you just build your structures like in the middle of the map all the bad guys that come from the top Will go straight to the bottom and leave and all the bad guys that come in from the left will go straight to the right And leave.

310
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:36,789
Scott: but if you build your towers like to make walls You can never block it off so you can never trap the bad guys so they can't get off the map Because that would just be stupid.

311
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:55,710
Scott: but what you can do is you can make a maze you can use your towers which deal damage and position them such that they make a maze and the enemies have to go in between the towers and you can give them a Very long path to follow before they make it to the other end of the map and are able to escape.

312
00:24:56,252 --> 00:25:02,090
Rym: Now we've all beaten level 50 pretty handily after playing this game a little bit And I think you'll be able to do well at it, too.

313
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:12,750
Rym: They'll warn you it is difficult and you're gonna have some trouble early on until you figure out a cue a cue a few key ideas like Maybe you should take a narrow path for your guys to follow.

314
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:20,177
Rym: Maybe you should try to funnel all the guys coming in into one spot and then have them go off together So you can maximize firepower, huh?

315
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:22,664
Rym: That one structure seems to damage things adjacent to it.

316
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,990
Rym: Maybe I should increase its surface area.

317
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:26,901
Scott: Yeah, all kinds of stuff like that.

318
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:28,370
Scott: It's pretty good.

319
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:41,650
Scott: There's a. I think the one thing that's about it That is the best is that in other tower defense games generally some towers are just better than others and it's a matter of do I build which tower do you build and are you gonna build more towers?

320
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,499
Scott: You're just gonna upgrade a few towers and this one.

321
00:25:44,519 --> 00:26:00,030
Scott: you kind of have to buy the cheap tower a lot even though it sucks relatively speaking because well You you have to build walls and there's no other way to build enough towers to make a maze other than using a lot Of the cheap tower and it's kind of annoying.

322
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:02,984
Scott: I just want to build a big tower, but no you can't.

323
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:04,130
Scott: I got to build a small tower.

324
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:10,750
Rym: I'll yummy many times and you find yourself making your thing pretty much out of these cheap pellet towers and you can also.

325
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:14,080
Rym: Then you'll augment that by putting special towers and key locations.

326
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:15,545
Rym: Everything's upgradeable.

327
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:16,648
Rym: You can sell stuff.

328
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:17,250
Rym: There's different kind.

329
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:20,419
Scott: Every tower defense game there's always been the option to sell.

330
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:32,150
Scott: this is the first time I've actually used it because I'll basically build a Maze with the shitty pellet towers and then you know That'll hold me out and I'll be able to get more money and then I'll sell pellet towers to put better ones in their place.

331
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:33,320
Scott: All right.

332
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,902
Scott: So, you know those bio Tapestries ba why you X?

333
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:38,406
Rym: yes.

334
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:38,969
Rym: Yes, I do.

335
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:39,932
Scott: It's the real.

336
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:45,326
Scott: it's a really long and narrow tapestry that shows the Norman invasion of England.

337
00:26:45,546 --> 00:26:46,910
Rym: dodongo dislike its smoke.

338
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:53,456
Scott: Yep, those this this Saxons dislike if the Normans Exactly, but that same tapestry.

339
00:26:53,536 --> 00:27:03,009
Scott: Well some guy decided he was gonna make something in the vein of that tapestry Involving, of course Super Mario, of course, of course.

340
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,302
Scott: So he made this really long image.

341
00:27:06,362 --> 00:27:07,085
Scott: It's like a few.

342
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:19,470
Scott: I guess if you printed it out It'd be a few feet long and as you scroll to the right it plays out a fucked up version Of level 1 - 1 in Super Mario Brothers.

343
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:23,325
Rym: It reminds me a lot of various walk down the street and fight games like.

344
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:24,590
Rym: the aesthetic is definitely there.

345
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,330
Rym: You know, we're your Hagar and you're punching guys and hammer locking them and killing them as you are.

346
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:35,288
Scott: Yeah, it also reminds me sort of a chromatic plus a communist Mario sort of thing Hagar and Freddy.

347
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:36,010
Rym: You're kind of similar.

348
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:46,809
Scott: yeah, yeah, they are and I'll just say that when you finally scroll to the very very right end of this tapestry if you will There is a joke waiting for you.

349
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:50,890
Scott: So make sure you start on the way left and scroll to the right very slowly.

350
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:57,431
Rym: Scott very pointedly took control of the mouse and showed it really revealed it to me bit by bit much the way you'd reveal a Newman.

351
00:27:57,471 --> 00:28:09,387
Scott: Yeah, if you view this as just one large image on some tremendously tremendous wide screen monitor or Many monitors side by side and have a really wide browser window You'll lose the whole effect.

352
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:17,785
Rym: If you have a monitor and a resolution such that you see this entire thing at once without having to do anything without having to Zoom out my head is off to you.

353
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:20,208
Scott: Good, sir It's pretty long.

354
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:27,150
Rym: So we've talked about a lot of different games lately and one thing we haven't talked about our PC games.

355
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:34,310
Scott: Well, I think that's partially because a lot of the PC games that we really like are old and dead and we all run Linux.

356
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,462
Scott: So we're not playing new PC games and our PCs suck.

357
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:39,109
Scott: So we're not playing new PC games.

358
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:42,269
Scott: Yes Particularly gaming is dying or dead.

359
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:48,728
Rym: Yes as is evidenced by the fact that Walmart is all but eliminating their PC game section in several of their cell.

360
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:51,119
Scott: if you went To an EB a few years ago.

361
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:53,510
Scott: The PC section is like one shelf.

362
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:56,360
Rym: Yeah, last time I went to an EB in New York City.

363
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,410
Rym: The only PC games they had were in this bin for five bucks.

364
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:01,530
Rym: I went over there, but there was nothing worth five.

365
00:29:01,592 --> 00:29:10,469
Scott: well if you go to the GameStop at Near us there's like, you know GameCube section the DS section the Wii section a giant ps2 section a giant Xbox 360 section.

366
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,983
Scott: They take up like big chunks of the wall of the store.

367
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:18,581
Scott: the PC games take up one Freestanding wheelie shelf in the middle of this man.

368
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:23,861
Rym: I remember a day when if I went to an EB They sold nothing but computer games pretty much.

369
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:28,409
Rym: Yeah, and if I wanted a non computer game I had to go to Toys R Us to buy a Nintendo game.

370
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:29,672
Scott: Yeah they used to be.

371
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:31,198
Scott: it's a good like software etc.

372
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:36,658
Scott: to get computer games and the PC games and the Console games were sold in completely different places.

373
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:36,919
Scott: Yep.

374
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:38,062
Rym: I think about this.

375
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,310
Rym: there were stores dedicated to selling PC games.

376
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,210
Scott: yeah, cuz PC games were considered software and Console games are considered toys.

377
00:29:45,557 --> 00:29:55,812
Rym: I would go to Babbages and pay 15 bucks more than I should have to get a PC game and it would be on the same shelf as a C Plus plus compiler from Borland Software etc.

378
00:29:56,073 --> 00:30:09,126
Rym: I just had a bunch of memories of when I was young wondering what the hell a compiler was and why I would $90 C++ compiler that for Windows 3.1 that is on like 14 floppy disks.

379
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:16,938
Rym: I also remember owning more PC games than I had hard drive space and having to rotate games in and out depending on what mood I was in.

380
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:23,005
Scott: anyway Wes Noth is an interesting PC game because number one it works no matter what your OS.

381
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:24,690
Scott: so Windows Mac Linux.

382
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:26,034
Scott: You can play this game dude.

383
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:32,295
Rym: You can play this on net BSD open VSD Solaris risk OS the GP 2x Windows BOS.

384
00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:32,778
Scott: All right.

385
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,214
Rym: All right Amiga OS 4.

386
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:37,870
Scott: Also, it doesn't require a whole lot of system resources.

387
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:40,170
Scott: You can play this without a 3d card just fine.

388
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:50,408
Scott: If you've got a computer with a screen and a mouse and a keyboard and a modern CPU I guess you could probably play this on a Pentium 3 if you wanted to probably handily.

389
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:52,475
Scott: Yeah You can play this game.

390
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:57,550
Scott: And thirdly this game is free as in all types of free.

391
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,035
Scott: It is free isn't beer free?

392
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:01,404
Scott: isn't speech free isn't free free free.

393
00:31:01,886 --> 00:31:03,090
Scott: It costs nothing to play.

394
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:04,037
Scott: You can edit it.

395
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:05,690
Scott: You can do whatever you want.

396
00:31:06,152 --> 00:31:10,390
Rym: So the battle for Wes Noth is a game designed by a man named David White.

397
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:14,530
Rym: He made it and I think 2003. he started it and he's now the lead developer for the project.

398
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:23,649
Rym: I'm obviously semi quoting Wikipedia And it's based very heavily on several of those old Sega Genesis turn-based strategy games.

399
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:26,593
Scott: Yes This is a turn-based Strategy game.

400
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:36,409
Scott: you have a hex map and you have units on the hex map and you click on them and you move them And then if they're end up next to a bad guy you tell them to attack and they do some damage.

401
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:44,957
Rym: now I have a dark secret to reveal that Despite all of my PC gaming and I had command and conquer and red alert and Warcraft and all these games And X calm and everything.

402
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:53,988
Scott: I've always hated RTS's like really Well, the thing is I liked Warcraft 1 just because it was a fun game in.

403
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:55,956
Scott: in those days I wasn't really thinking about it.

404
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:58,950
Scott: I also like command and conquer for the same reason.

405
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:03,610
Rym: I liked Warcraft 1 and I liked command and conquer 1 but aircraft 2 also.

406
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:09,720
Rym: But I didn't enjoy them as much as I could because I spent half the game going Wow, this is really neat and half the game going.

407
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:10,623
Scott: god damn it.

408
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:12,169
Scott: Get out of the way the tank what?

409
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:25,530
Scott: Yes, I think over time the Frustrations with the RTS genre and the lack of change in it frustrated me enough that it was no longer fun Like when it I Warcraft 1 was a new idea.

410
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:35,170
Scott: Like when I saw Warcraft 1 I was like what the hell kind of game is this and the RTS was new and exciting And it was pretty much Warcraft 1 Warcraft 2 command and conquer command and conquer red alert.

411
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:38,565
Scott: Those are the four RTS's I guess total annihilation is.

412
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:41,748
Rym: you know, I know Is in a class all unto.

413
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:49,070
Scott: yes I never played it enough But I have a hard time disagreeing that it is like the RTS of RTS's and maybe supreme commander.

414
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:53,130
Scott: I don't know if I can say about that yet But yeah, I've heard good buzz on the internet.

415
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:58,650
Rym: But the only people who can play supreme commander with $5,000 computer like the hardest of core PC gamers.

416
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,990
Rym: And if you're a hardcore PC gamer, that's like being a hardcore Cubs fan.

417
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:14,730
Scott: Yeah, and while Warcraft 3 and Starcraft and those sorts of you know, and the newer command and conquers was probably technically RTS's they weren't really fun for me like even Starcraft which everyone loves.

418
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:18,610
Scott: It's not fun for me because it comes down to just being annoying.

419
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:25,430
Scott: I mean, it's click on know what buildings to build in the right order and know how many units to build.

420
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,340
Rym: Yeah, real-time strategy games are barely well one.

421
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,250
Rym: They're almost not about tactics at all or even about strategy.

422
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,013
Scott: It's like you.

423
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:36,790
Scott: eventually I mean I watched my brother play Warcraft 3 because he didn't play too many RTS's in his childhood.

424
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:43,370
Scott: So he got Warcraft 3 when he was into PC gaming and all he would do is know what order to build the buildings in.

425
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:46,610
Scott: Have the hero walk around the board getting levels.

426
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:53,449
Scott: Then he would eventually get like a supreme unit build as many as he could Select them all and click on the enemy base and that was it.

427
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:53,808
Scott: Yeah

428
00:33:54,231 --> 00:34:16,610
Rym: I just play a lot of command and conquer online with a lot of people with my modem and then my cable modem back in the day and there was all those gaming networks, but I Weren't my friends who lived in the neighborhood who played the same way I did and I always would build units Like I'd build a squadron of tanks and then I'd send it off to a corner to the map and have him wait there.

429
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:22,270
Rym: Well, I built another group of units put somewhere else and I try to coordinate like pincer attacks and ambushes.

430
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:23,590
Scott: None of that stuff matters.

431
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:28,254
Rym: I tried to have strategy and one day one of my friends who was good at the game But I never really played against.

432
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:40,155
Rym: I asked him if I could just watch him play online because he always won and all he did Was build the tank producing buildings build a billion tanks select them all click on the enemy base weights Yeah, and I was like what?

433
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:41,880
Rym: Ah, that's how you win.

434
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,966
Rym: and he's like, yeah, what were you doing?

435
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:45,050
Rym: trying to build a wall?

436
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:51,725
Scott: Yeah, they put like command-and-conquer alert had walls cement walls barbed wire walls land mines.

437
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,550
Scott: All that stuff was useless.

438
00:34:53,842 --> 00:35:02,259
Scott: Yeah Pretty only strategy was if you're the Soviets build as many tanks as you can and click on the enemy base Much like the actual Soviet military doctor.

439
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,721
Scott: Yes.

440
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,885
Scott: It was quite accurate.

441
00:35:03,945 --> 00:35:10,810
Scott: Anyway, this is why Regardless of accuracy or realism or anything else turn-based strategy games are fun.

442
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,909
Scott: Because this strategy you get to do whatever you want on your turn you have time to think about it.

443
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,636
Scott: You get there's.

444
00:35:17,736 --> 00:35:20,989
Scott: actually it matters what you make and where you move it to.

445
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:23,788
Scott: You can look at numbers and figure out.

446
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:25,616
Scott: you know How much damage is gonna be done.

447
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:27,403
Scott: this terrain that matters.

448
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:36,530
Scott: and when you're done you push End by turn and then the other person goes and they take their turn because it's turn-based and not real-time.

449
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:36,771
Rym: Yep.

450
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,557
Rym: Now a bunch of other turn-based games.

451
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,665
Rym: I would definitely recommend advance Wars.

452
00:35:41,147 --> 00:35:47,370
Rym: any advanced Wars game Especially advanced Wars 2 for the Gameboy Advance and X come X calm is very good.

453
00:35:47,872 --> 00:35:54,281
Rym: If you're hardcore, I'd recommend this game called gem fire for the SNES But I don't think anyone's gonna be playing gem fire.

454
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,350
Rym: Jet fire is a badass freaking game.

455
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,393
Rym: You can die in a fire.

456
00:35:57,634 --> 00:36:02,790
Scott: fantasy empires if you count that fantasy empires is turn-based and real-time.

457
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:03,915
Scott: Is it her.

458
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,161
Scott: I didn't know it was real time at all.

459
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:06,930
Rym: combat itself is real time.

460
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:10,681
Rym: Oh, right, but it's statistically based and it's not.

461
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:13,990
Rym: it's not really real - it's basically it's real time.

462
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,710
Rym: That doesn't pretend to have all this strategy.

463
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:22,306
Rym: basically all your units will be AI and they'll charge and all the enemies units of the AI and they'll charge.

464
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:23,049
Rym: and it call.

465
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:29,158
Rym: it comes down to is statistically which army was better and The one guy you were controlling?

466
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:34,919
Rym: you could do something specific like run over and smash up the enemy Yeah, that sort of thing.

467
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,050
Rym: Yeah, so that's really a special case.

468
00:36:37,452 --> 00:36:43,666
Rym: But all those things aside for the PC right now I would say that Wesnoth is the premier RTS.

469
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:48,650
Rym: If not, what not RTS turn-based game if not one of the top ten?

470
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:55,366
Scott: Yeah, and civilization doesn't count because that's not like a strategy war game That's a strategy civilization game is different.

471
00:36:55,748 --> 00:36:59,660
Rym: Yes Now Wesnoth is not a deterministic game.

472
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,427
Rym: Advance Wars is for the most part of determine.

473
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:04,538
Scott: Yes in Advance Wars it's deterministic.

474
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:16,959
Scott: that means if You have an infantry You know from this CEO and an infantry from that CEO and they're both standing on planes and they shoot each other This and this guy is the attacker and that guy's the defender.

475
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,299
Scott: every single time the same amount of damage will be done Pretty much like 90% of the time.

476
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:26,790
Scott: there's like so little difference in how much damage is done that it doesn't matter.

477
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:34,282
Rym: I mean I can know playing against Scott that if I'm grit and I've got an artillery and I shoot it at his tank and It's in this terrain and it's this damage

478
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:35,670
Scott: and he's in this terrain

479
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:39,024
Rym: I will do X damage to it and I can plan accordingly and so can Scott.

480
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:42,960
Scott: Yes and Wesnoth it is not as deterministic.

481
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:51,670
Scott: if yes, I have a Foot pad and he attacks a bat He'll do pretty much almost the same amount of damage each time.

482
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,605
Scott: But he it's sort of like D&D where it's like you might miss is it he might miss?

483
00:37:55,645 --> 00:37:56,267
Scott: sometimes they do.

484
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,232
Scott: they just go miss miss miss.

485
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:02,498
Scott: sometimes they'll hit hit hit and kill the bat right away and Sometimes he'll do some in-between.

486
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:05,230
Scott: there is sort of this randomness in the game.

487
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:06,171
Scott: They were.

488
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:09,042
Scott: it's like the game is rolling dice for you where you can't see.

489
00:38:09,524 --> 00:38:11,169
Rym: Yes, but the did the key thing here.

490
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,190
Rym: now We're not gonna go into a whole debate of deterministic versus random games.

491
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,150
Rym: Yes, I think that both methods have very much merit.

492
00:38:17,352 --> 00:38:23,345
Rym: They really depends on what you're going for Yep And you can't say that one is better than the other and I I strongly disagree with people who do.

493
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:24,510
Rym: a lot of people do.

494
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:30,950
Rym: In fact, there are a lot of people who have forked Wesnoth and made deterministic versions and there's a bunch of them and they're all pretty bad.

495
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:33,215
Scott: Yeah, notice how the.

496
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:42,037
Scott: if any of the deterministic versions running good then the actual Wesnoth probably would have inherited those Deterministic traits and it hasn't therefore.

497
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:42,659
Rym: Yes,

498
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:44,945
Scott: obviously those deterministic games are no good,

499
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:59,290
Rym: but a common pitfall of Random damage games or any game where there's a lot of randomness or things that determine randomly like this Is that if you don't have enough of the randomness if you don't have enough instances where randomness is a factor?

500
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,849
Rym: Randomness can affect the game more readily because there's less time for it to even out.

501
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:17,734
Rym: Mmm, I think a battle lore is a good example of a game where while it can be fun I'm not gonna argue about this the randomness is concentrated to the point that one short run of bad luck can make you lose a battle Wholly and immediately.

502
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:27,310
Rym: well in Wesnoth, there is enough testing of randomness to where overall it would take one Freaking bad run for you to lose solely on red.

503
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:37,180
Scott: Well, I think the thing in Wesnoth is that randomness while it's there It serves two purposes and The first purpose is that it makes the game very simple.

504
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:45,210
Scott: part of the goal of Wesnoth is to have a turn-based war game That is simple that anyone can play it and not have to be a hardcore war master.

505
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:54,970
Rym: Yes yet at the same time He very much wanted a simple game that is not trivial a game that still has great tactical and strategic depth But yet doesn't force you to do mundane calculation.

506
00:39:54,970 --> 00:40:01,196
Scott: yes, the other part of the advantage of the randomness is that it Removes any paralysis.

507
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:04,690
Scott: analysis paralysis if there was if it was a deterministic game.

508
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,805
Scott: It's a hex map with a whole bunch of different units and a whole bunch of factors.

509
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:12,142
Scott: You'd be sitting there Exactly calculating everything.

510
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:13,349
Scott: with the randomness.

511
00:40:13,771 --> 00:40:18,309
Scott: It encourages you to just take your goddamn turn because and you just you just kind of go with it.

512
00:40:18,662 --> 00:40:18,768
Rym: Yep.

513
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:25,517
Rym: and also one big thing about war games that I have a love-hate relationship with is that Actual real warfare?

514
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:30,529
Rym: if you study history, I mean most people would say yeah in a video game You want it to be a hundred percent?

515
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:35,058
Rym: deterministic or even if it's random You want skill to no matter what.

516
00:40:35,118 --> 00:40:39,216
Rym: if you send a better unit against a weaker unit you think that the weaker unit should always Die no matter what.

517
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:46,065
Rym: but actual warfare Relies a lot more on luck happenstance and just dumb circumstance.

518
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:47,670
Rym: Yes, then it ever has.

519
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:58,249
Rym: Okay, I mean battles turn on the fact that oh shits it rained one day or oh no Hitler was asleep And they didn't send the troops out in time.

520
00:40:59,250 --> 00:40:59,993
Rym: Things like that.

521
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:05,730
Rym: Yeah, so a real a realistic war game has a lot more randomness than a pure gamer might like.

522
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:15,315
Rym: So a balanced war game that is based on randomness at all or as randomness in it You have to straddle that fine line between having someone to you know You have to make the decision of.

523
00:41:15,837 --> 00:41:18,990
Rym: my cavalry might not come back if I send them into that plane.

524
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:24,110
Scott: The last comment I want to make about the randomness in Wesnoth is that it definitely adds some drama in the game.

525
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:29,425
Scott: Yes, sometimes, you know if the stronger unit always wanted it was deterministic.

526
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:33,910
Scott: when you send a guy out to fight It's not exciting and it would actually make the game less fun.

527
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:39,290
Scott: If you know aha my giant troll smashes your puny zombie, right?

528
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:47,050
Scott: But if it's sort of random Sometimes like a guy with a sword will go and cut up a really strong bad guy and do a lot of damage.

529
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:50,521
Scott: And now that guy has to run away and it's like haha.

530
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:51,023
Scott: Look at that.

531
00:41:51,143 --> 00:41:58,282
Scott: Oh, yeah, and sometimes, you know it'll be random and a guy will go up and Attack and it won't do anything and you'd be like oh shit cuz.

532
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:05,329
Scott: now your guy is standing there out in the middle of the War zone and he didn't do any damage and there's a really strong pissed off guy right next to him.

533
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:14,341
Rym: Yep ah, I'll be watching like my last holdout standing in the elven fortress and Scott zombies are surrounding it and I'm just come on man.

534
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:15,625
Rym: Just hold out one more round.

535
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:16,870
Scott: Just hold out just hold out.

536
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:20,461
Scott: Yeah, well if you haven't gathered Wesnoth has a fantasy theme.

537
00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:22,147
Scott: It's not outer space.

538
00:42:22,568 --> 00:42:27,702
Scott: It's not Real military guys, it's wizards and goblins and all that shit.

539
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:30,490
Scott: and there are basically six different races.

540
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,490
Rym: You can choose to play as yeah in the normal default game because one remember this is open source.

541
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:41,430
Rym: So the game is entirely extensible and people is actually a Wesnoth programming language.

542
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:46,410
Scott: You can make campaigns and you can pretty much make anything it for Wesnoth in this language.

543
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:58,238
Rym: There's also a very active community around this game And if you go into the Wesnoth forums There are a lot of people who would love for you to commit to add things to this game to submit comments Critiques to make art for it music anything.

544
00:42:58,338 --> 00:42:58,519
Rym: Yep.

545
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,170
Scott: Well, the six races are the rebels who are basically the elves.

546
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:07,106
Scott: Yes, the elves they have lots of elves on their team and they're very good in the trees.

547
00:43:07,366 --> 00:43:12,569
Scott: when an elf is in a tree He's pretty dangerous and when he's out not in a tree, he's pretty weak.

548
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:22,013
Scott: They also have ends on the elven team which are when they're in the trees You can't even see them and then they pop out of the trees and they're really big and they do a lot of damage because well They're trees.

549
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:25,250
Rym: that well, this is another key factor in what I think makes Wesnoth great.

550
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:33,224
Rym: Now look at the game like advanced wars and it's largely Symmetric in that any two forces that are fighting will be similar.

551
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:35,130
Rym: like every force has anti-aircraft.

552
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:37,750
Scott: Yeah, everyone pretty much has the same units in advanced wars.

553
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:43,069
Scott: Everyone has infantry mech small tank medium tank neo tank mega tank, etc.

554
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:48,630
Rym: Now there might be variances like this guy's artillery are more powerful or this guy's infantry are weak.

555
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:50,923
Scott: Yes But the other people still have infantry.

556
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:55,849
Rym: it's still largely Symmetric that both sides are generally equal or generally similar.

557
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:58,037
Rym: Wesnoth is very asymmetric.

558
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:04,601
Rym: each of these factions or races or whatever you want to call them have Completely different sets of units and types of units.

559
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:12,910
Rym: some are have a lot of artillery not artillery But a lot of cavalry and foot soldiers while other ones have a lot of flying dragons.

560
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:17,738
Scott: it's a lot more like Starcraft where the Zerg's and What the humans?

561
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,463
Scott: the Terrans?

562
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:19,509
Scott: I think it was the third one.

563
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:23,590
Scott: Well, I don't remember but there's three completely different races.

564
00:44:23,711 --> 00:44:24,012
Scott: You know.

565
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:32,790
Scott: one of them is a few expensive really strong guys And the other ones are really good at the night time and there's lots of undead bat.

566
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,919
Scott: There's like weak flying guys and strong ground guys.

567
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,650
Scott: Another one has lots of guys with ranged attacks, you know, they're all completely different.

568
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:46,942
Rym: There's basically dragons undead Looks like orcs and trolls humans dwarves elves.

569
00:44:47,123 --> 00:45:07,070
Scott: The dwarves have this one really interesting unit I want to mention called the olf surker and He is really cool because the way he works is when most units in this game Have an attack such as like three five Three five means when they fight they try to hit three times and if they do hit they'll do five damage.

570
00:45:07,391 --> 00:45:13,090
Rym: Right now this harkens this idea all the way back to a bunch of old RTS especially on Sega systems.

571
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:16,586
Rym: Yes, well, and I keep saying RTS is turn-based game.

572
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:19,468
Rym: Yes Because TTS just doesn't feel so good.

573
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:30,330
Scott: No TBS or whatever you wanna but the olf surker guy anyway, he will not stop attacking He just keeps attacking until either he kills the other guy or he died.

574
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:39,550
Rym: Well what I was gonna say before you continued was that a lot of these turn-based games in Order to prevent the game bogging down into once two units meet they fight until one of them dies.

575
00:45:39,952 --> 00:45:49,890
Rym: They'd often have an idea where when two units fight There's a set number of turns or a set number of actions Like I'll get to attack twice and he'll get to attack twice and then combat stops until the next turn.

576
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:57,958
Rym: this game does that in terms of any unit can attack X number of times for X number of damage and Counter-attack X number of times for X number of damage.

577
00:45:58,259 --> 00:45:58,440
Scott: Yep.

578
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:03,781
Rym: So yeah now also think instead of Artillery or long-range attacks.

579
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:04,826
Rym: There's no such thing as that.

580
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:09,883
Rym: instead It breaks it up in terms of normal melee combat, but based on type.

581
00:46:10,244 --> 00:46:16,682
Rym: So if I attack a unit with Archery or ranged attacks then it can only respond with ranged attacks.

582
00:46:16,883 --> 00:46:17,063
Scott: Yes.

583
00:46:17,123 --> 00:46:19,670
Scott: There's no ranged attacks from multiple hexes away.

584
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,450
Scott: So like if you're three hexes away from me, I can't shoot you with my arrows.

585
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:26,050
Scott: You always have to be adjacent to whoever you're fighting.

586
00:46:26,732 --> 00:46:35,965
Scott: But the thing is if I use arrows on you then if you don't have a ranged attack You're pretty much I shoot at you and you don't shoot at me at all.

587
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,408
Scott: I don't take any damage You don't even have a chance to damage me.

588
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:43,730
Scott: But then if you go into melee with me, I can go into melee with you if I have a melee attack.

589
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:49,490
Scott: So usually when you fight this counter-attacking like hit hit hit hit hit hit hit hit hit it in both directions.

590
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:52,183
Rym: Yes now also aside from being ranged or whatever.

591
00:46:52,203 --> 00:46:53,690
Rym: There's a lot of different kinds of attacking.

592
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:56,450
Rym: There's your blade weapon attacks piercing weapon attack.

593
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:02,426
Rym: It's like slash Pierce bludgeon magic all kinds of fire cold and it comes down to.

594
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:03,870
Rym: there's a lot of strategic depth here.

595
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:13,210
Rym: But again because it's asymmetric and you'll only have a subset of the total kinds of units There's not so much information for you to manage and it's all really straightforward.

596
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:18,990
Rym: Piercing weapons don't work so well against skeletons because the arrows would just go right through them and the Spears just go right through.

597
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:20,478
Scott: You want to use some bludgeons on those.

598
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:22,549
Rym: yes, but hammers or magic take him right out.

599
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:27,950
Rym: Yep, or a spear or something like that does a whole ton of damage against a cavalry unit.

600
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:29,760
Scott: And this is where the strategy comes in.

601
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:31,430
Scott: is let's say the other guy has the elves.

602
00:47:31,491 --> 00:47:32,729
Scott: He has the big trees, right?

603
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,749
Scott: So you get some mages who shoot fire to go out and burn the trees down.

604
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:45,449
Scott: But those mages are pretty weak and if some elves of swords come along, especially in the woods They're just gonna chop up your mages and it's not gonna work.

605
00:47:45,891 --> 00:48:01,369
Scott: So you have to sort of build the correct numbers of units and send them out in a well arranged group and like just the Right hexes so that you know The enemy can't get your guys and you can get your guys that are strong against them in the correct groupings.

606
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,830
Rym: now It's a jumping switch.

607
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,558
Scott: You're gonna lose.

608
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:10,710
Rym: in addition to that There is a continuous passage of time and it'll oscillate between day and night slowly turn by turn.

609
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,190
Scott: Yeah, like every three or four turns it'll change from day to night and there's a though.

610
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,690
Rym: There's dusk day dawn all those things and some units fight better at night some fight.

611
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:21,460
Rym: Okay, all the time some fight better during the day.

612
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:32,962
Scott: Yeah, so generally if you're the undead right at night You're gonna be on the offensive because you're way stronger than your opponent unless your opponent is also the undead in which case it doesn't Matter and during the day you might actually run away.

613
00:48:32,982 --> 00:48:35,010
Scott: if you're the undead because you you're really weak.

614
00:48:35,632 --> 00:48:45,590
Rym: but yet some factions will have neutral guys who aren't affected by day and night and Lawful or and Chaotic chaotic being the ones who are better at night and lawful being the ones who are better during the day.

615
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:50,746
Scott: Yeah So there's actually you know every few turns sort of the tide of the game has to change.

616
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:52,612
Scott: you have to mix up your guys Accordingly.

617
00:48:52,832 --> 00:49:01,615
Rym: now along with one other important tactical consideration, which is terrain which basically summed up terrain matters an Incredible amount in this game.

618
00:49:01,635 --> 00:49:03,964
Scott: Yeah, it's like a dwarf in the mountains will fuck you up.

619
00:49:04,004 --> 00:49:06,253
Scott: an elf in the forest is like twice as Powerful.

620
00:49:06,314 --> 00:49:07,725
Rym: Yep a merman in the water.

621
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:09,835
Scott: You've got no chance But a merman on the land.

622
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:11,180
Scott: What's he doing there?

623
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,786
Rym: Yeah, he's pretty much just gonna die.

624
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:13,830
Scott: Yeah, the merman are pretty cool.

625
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:14,492
Scott: I like merman.

626
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:20,669
Rym: Yeah, now all of these factors combined make it so where the game has a very dynamic field.

627
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:35,650
Rym: now Look at advanced wars a deterministic game where in order to reduce analysis paralysis and all the problems inherent in deterministic games They basically had to make the game incredibly simple and make the maps very small and terrain matters But not nearly as much as it does in Wesnoth.

628
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:43,370
Rym: Wesnoth because the maps tend to be much larger and Wesnoth works even on gigantic maps Depending on how you set it up as long as you have enough players.

629
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:53,510
Rym: Yeah But the game is such that it's very dynamic and strategies can very much be along the lines of I want to send a scouting party To the south to secure all those villages.

630
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:59,110
Rym: Well, I muster troops in the north and send them along a line to secure the front along the water.

631
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:08,070
Rym: I'm then gonna wait overnight in this strong defensive position Because I'm lawful and then once dawn breaks, I'm gonna rush over the water and attack the undead.

632
00:50:08,412 --> 00:50:11,370
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of you have to keep changing what you're doing.

633
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:14,610
Scott: There's no like one straightforward way to win in Wesnoth.

634
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:22,661
Scott: Yeah You can't build a bunch of not like Starcraft or you can just build your strongest unit as many times as you can and then send them over to the enemy's base and Win, this is not gonna work.

635
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:23,910
Rym: This is where Wesnoth shines.

636
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:31,628
Rym: It's one of those rare games but one of those rare any kind of combat games with strategy and tactics where you have to consider the situation.

637
00:50:31,648 --> 00:50:32,310
Rym: and we're.

638
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:38,057
Rym: Retreating is not only often prudent But retreat reading will often win you a battle.

639
00:50:38,317 --> 00:50:43,130
Rym: an orderly retreat regroup and counter-attack is a very valid and important tactic.

640
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:51,870
Scott: Yeah, I think the reason that is is because generally if you're attacking with a like a homogenous You know group or a lot of the units are the same type.

641
00:50:52,251 --> 00:50:57,310
Scott: It's gonna be real weak because the other guys is gonna send the type of unit that destroys your guys over there.

642
00:50:57,753 --> 00:50:59,464
Scott: so you generally want to mix it up.

643
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:03,110
Scott: and The problem is is some units are fast and some are slow.

644
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:05,459
Scott: So some of them you send out into the battlefield.

645
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,993
Scott: the other ones still need to catch up and then night will come or day Will come.

646
00:51:09,013 --> 00:51:09,980
Scott: and now your guys are weak.

647
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:11,470
Scott: So you retreat a little bit.

648
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:13,536
Scott: It allows some guys to catch up.

649
00:51:13,596 --> 00:51:16,024
Scott: it allows some other guys to fall back and not get killed.

650
00:51:16,325 --> 00:51:18,070
Scott: then the day changes again.

651
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:23,070
Scott: Now you've got this nice little army all grewed up grouped up full of all the different types of units.

652
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:25,401
Scott: You can move it forward take back the territory.

653
00:51:25,421 --> 00:51:26,988
Scott: You just retreated from and take some more.

654
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:32,718
Rym: Yep There's also the fact that you can only generate Generally units with your leader.

655
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,487
Rym: every side of it has a leader and you lose if your leader gets killed.

656
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:39,666
Rym: if the leader is in A keep he can recruit units and you can only generally.

657
00:51:39,686 --> 00:51:43,150
Rym: I mean you can Theoretically move your leader to any keep and recruit units there.

658
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:47,564
Rym: But a lot of maps will only have two one where you are one where your enemy is.

659
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:49,330
Scott: Yeah or one for each guy.

660
00:51:49,451 --> 00:51:51,069
Scott: So if there's four players, they'll be four keeps.

661
00:51:51,374 --> 00:52:02,010
Rym: So as a result the further you spread out or the more you were on the Defensive the longer supply chains are the longer it takes units to get to back up your troops or to make a fallback line.

662
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:09,857
Scott: yeah, the only way to solve that problem is to make a giant army and then move your leader out into the field and bring Him to the enemy's keep.

663
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:12,350
Scott: win take that keep and use that one.

664
00:52:12,571 --> 00:52:20,988
Rym: But while you're making this giant army Depending on how you're playing because there can't you may or may not have fog of war and shrouds and all sorts of things Where you can or cannot see what's going on?

665
00:52:21,451 --> 00:52:33,377
Rym: Maybe the enemy has a scout up there or you can just see and he watches the army you were building and he just makes at his leisure a Defensive army ready to hold out again As soon as your leader is out of your keep.

666
00:52:33,578 --> 00:52:37,752
Scott: you can't make any more units and he's still making them while you're walking over There.

667
00:52:38,214 --> 00:52:41,230
Rym: yes now also units generally don't heal on their own.

668
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:51,557
Rym: You either need to send units that can heal other units by being adjacent grab your guys into towns hold them behind the lines and let them rest not moving for a while or Build new units.

669
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:54,288
Scott: Yeah, or level them up.

670
00:52:54,449 --> 00:53:01,150
Rym: Yes Now this is a game mechanic that I've seen in a few games But the first time I ever saw it was in a game for the Sega Game Gear called crystal warrior.

671
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:05,591
Scott: Well, the first time I saw it was actually at least in a strategy game was Warcraft 3.

672
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:09,347
Rym: Well, I guess if you maybe crystal fucking warriors for the game gear.

673
00:53:09,368 --> 00:53:15,663
Rym: Yeah Yeah basically The idea is units have experience points and you get like fire emblem.

674
00:53:15,783 --> 00:53:20,969
Rym: you get experience points every time your unit Survives combat regardless of whether or not he started it.

675
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:23,401
Rym: You also get a ton of experience points.

676
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:27,818
Scott: if you take out an enemy unit Yes, now here's where the strategy comes in.

677
00:53:27,879 --> 00:53:31,130
Scott: Let's say there's a unit that is worth a lot of experience points.

678
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:39,190
Scott: You've got one guy on the cusp of leveling and you've got another guy who's actually really strong against that type of unit Who's not in the cusp of leveling?

679
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,909
Scott: So you have the guy who's really strong attack and he doesn't kill it.

680
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,274
Scott: He brings it real low.

681
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:48,810
Scott: then your guy in the cusp of leveling deals the final blow and gets all the XP and levels up.

682
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,505
Rym: Now this is important for a number of reasons.

683
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:56,328
Rym: one Anytime a unit levels up it gets full health back and this is a strategy and crystal warriors.

684
00:53:56,368 --> 00:54:04,701
Rym: back in the day I used all the time where I use a unit and I use a unit and he's on the verge of death or I plan It to where right as he's near death.

685
00:54:04,962 --> 00:54:06,670
Rym: He's gonna level up and get all his life back.

686
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:11,696
Scott: Another thing I'll do is I'll take a unit and I'll try to get it Experience and then heal it.

687
00:54:12,077 --> 00:54:21,742
Scott: and if it's close to leveling and I'll heal it just enough so that it won't die I'll put it out in a dangerous position Just to tempt the other guy into attacking it and making it level up.

688
00:54:22,283 --> 00:54:31,607
Rym: or if you've got a unit that's close to leveling but it's also close to dead you bring it back behind your lines and Heal it just to make sure it doesn't die and then send it back.

689
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:38,450
Rym: the game Rewards you for trying to keep units alive and retreating as opposed to just sending units off really nothing to die.

690
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:42,590
Scott: Also when guys level up they become real dangerous.

691
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:48,623
Rym: Yes every unit has a leveling tree of some kind where some units just get more powerful.

692
00:54:48,964 --> 00:54:52,296
Rym: some units like say you've got a Cavalry guy.

693
00:54:52,316 --> 00:54:53,666
Rym: he has a sword and he levels up.

694
00:54:54,069 --> 00:55:06,410
Rym: now You can choose if you want a knight who has X hit points and has a lance that does a bunch of charging damage But also has a sword or a lancer who has a crazy lance attack, but no sword attack and he moves further.

695
00:55:07,612 --> 00:55:14,548
Scott: And depending on which one of those you choose that will determine their future Upgrading if they ever get to level three or four or five or any other level.

696
00:55:14,629 --> 00:55:19,190
Rym: Yes So generally you're rewarded by having units that survive a long time.

697
00:55:19,471 --> 00:55:28,593
Rym: so you're rewarded by playing the game like an actual person in battle and Tending to wounded units and having a primary line and a secondary line Yeah all that sort of stuff.

698
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:33,990
Scott: the other reason that saving units from death is really important is because the way the resources work in.

699
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,096
Scott: There's pretty much one resource gold.

700
00:55:36,457 --> 00:55:40,750
Scott: you start with an amount of gold and you get a base income of a certain amount of gold.

701
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:44,329
Scott: A turn usually not very much for every unit you have on the board.

702
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:49,105
Scott: yeah, if you have too many then you have to start paying money to support them.

703
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,429
Scott: sort of an upkeep if you will.

704
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:52,649
Scott: and There are cities on the board.

705
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:58,048
Scott: now if you send a guy into a city then you put a little flag in that city that has your color on it.

706
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:02,910
Scott: that City gives you a certain amount of money each turn and it helps you out with your upkeep action.

707
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,083
Rym: Yep, see units cost upkeep and it's per level.

708
00:56:06,123 --> 00:56:08,191
Rym: So higher level units cost even more upkeep Yep,

709
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:21,110
Scott: so what you're trying to do is in addition to building units and destroying the other guy You're trying to basically touch all these cities To get flags in them to increase your income to make it so you can build units faster.

710
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:30,750
Scott: Yep, also cities are highly defensible and heal Yep, so it's sort of like you can't just march in an army straight towards the enemy base.

711
00:56:30,831 --> 00:56:42,681
Scott: You need to go around collecting cities and making sure the other guy doesn't sneak around stealing them back from you because all you need to do to take a city is make a guy move into it and a lot Of the races you can choose like the undead have these flying bats.

712
00:56:43,043 --> 00:56:45,030
Scott: They're real weak relatively cheap.

713
00:56:45,372 --> 00:56:47,250
Scott: They can fly real far and real fast.

714
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,739
Scott: If you don't kill the bats.

715
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:54,270
Scott: if a guy builds like four bats You can fly them around the map and just take all the cities and like two turns.

716
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:55,934
Scott: It's pretty crazy.

717
00:56:55,954 --> 00:57:08,690
Rym: Yeah effectively in the end the game no matter how you're playing it Rewards actual tactical and strategic play to the point that you get a dynamic ever-changing Awesome experience just about every time you play.

718
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:13,030
Scott: It's also simple enough that you don't have to be a war genius to figure it out.

719
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:26,690
Scott: You might need to be smarter than the person you're playing against to win Often but you're gonna have fun regardless, and there's an easy single-player games that you can play And it's real easy to set this game up for all sorts of multiplayer.

720
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:36,570
Rym: Yes, now let's talk about the different modes of play a bit because the game comes with a bunch of single-player straight-up story-based Campaigns that are mostly awesome.

721
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:44,699
Rym: I highly recommend if you're picking this game up for the first time that you tried the South Guard and pick whatever Difficulty level you deem appropriate to your level of intelligence.

722
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:47,830
Scott: There's also a one really really easy campaign.

723
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:53,670
Scott: I don't know the name of it But basically it's like four missions and you just chase an evil wizard around to like four different maps.

724
00:57:54,232 --> 00:57:56,502
Scott: But it's real fun because it's so easy.

725
00:57:57,024 --> 00:57:57,265
Rym: Yes.

726
00:57:57,506 --> 00:58:02,830
Rym: Now the single-player Regardless of anything else is fun and you can just play it like a straight-up game.

727
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:07,802
Rym: If I had bought this game and it had these campaigns in it I probably would have felt okay with it because they're.

728
00:58:08,044 --> 00:58:18,710
Rym: the stories are pretty good The scenarios are interesting the some of them are very interesting and the game is so extensible that there's one in one campaign Where it even tells you you can't win.

729
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:20,670
Rym: All you were doing is holding the line.

730
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:35,196
Rym: You have a bunch of units and your goal is to hold off the undead scourge as long as you can Dying to the last ban and depending on how long you hold out more troops or less troops are mustered at the actual castle Where you make your real last stand.

731
00:58:35,737 --> 00:58:44,487
Scott: a lot of fun stuff that shows you how powerful the Wesnoth language is and that you can Make a campaign like that, you know that it even allows for that sort of craziness that go on.

732
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:49,282
Scott: but yeah There's in addition to all those cool single-player campaigns.

733
00:58:49,562 --> 00:58:51,729
Scott: You can just play a multiplayer game against AI.

734
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:56,885
Scott: Yeah, and the AI in this game is not the best AI in the world, but it's pretty smart.

735
00:58:57,186 --> 00:58:58,169
Scott: It'll get can beat you.

736
00:58:58,762 --> 00:58:59,873
Scott: Yeah I spent like.

737
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:00,354
Scott: we tried.

738
00:59:00,395 --> 00:59:05,412
Scott: we thought oh the AI is dumb and we played against it with like by giving it more resources than We had.

739
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:09,290
Scott: cuz like we're smarter than the AI will give it more resources and it just kicked our asses.

740
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:13,390
Scott: So we played it with even resources and it was a semi even game.

741
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,981
Scott: We still won but it was just pretty even.

742
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:20,068
Rym: yeah, I mean compared to Advance Wars AI This game is a thousand times better AI.

743
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:23,806
Scott: I think it's part of the goal of the Wesnoth project actually is to have AI.

744
00:59:23,846 --> 00:59:26,797
Scott: that's kind of smart And they have succeeded in doing that.

745
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:28,302
Rym: now in terms of multiplayer.

746
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,590
Rym: You can play on official Wesnoth servers.

747
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:32,096
Rym: You can run your own server.

748
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:35,870
Rym: You can run your client and have other people connect to your client.

749
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:39,070
Scott: Yeah, it pretty much allows for every sort of multiplayer connection.

750
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:42,870
Rym: You can do hot seat where everyone just shares one PC and it dings when it's your turn.

751
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:51,930
Scott: Yeah, it lets you do just about everything, you know, you can customize pick whatever map make your own maps Make whatever rules you want random a random apps.

752
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:58,490
Scott: You could decide random races or pick your races or you know, one guy starts with this much gold.

753
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,849
Scott: No, the guy doesn't start with any gold.

754
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:03,621
Scott: You can also go on two on one three on one seven on one.

755
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:13,128
Rym: you can go online and download all sorts of campaign scenarios races rules extensions everything you can make every everything you want.

756
01:00:13,189 --> 01:00:13,470
Scott: also

757
01:00:14,092 --> 01:00:27,200
Rym: I mean in some if you call yourself a PC gamer and you have not played the battle for Wesnoth Not only are you missing out on one of the best PC games out there right now But you're missing out on one of the best turn-based strategy games ever

758
01:00:27,401 --> 01:00:31,112
Scott: and one of the only good free open source games Cuz.

759
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:36,006
Rym: while open source software is awesome open source games are perhaps the worst things ever.

760
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:37,210
Scott: most of them are anyway.

761
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,139
Rym: We spent a whole day.

762
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:39,250
Rym: We're gonna do a show on this later.

763
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:42,604
Rym: We spent a day looking for open source games that were good.

764
01:00:42,644 --> 01:00:54,530
Rym: me Scott and Alex sat here Just each one of us picking games and trying to play them and the fact that some of these games None of us was able to make them work let alone play them or enjoy them.

765
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:57,223
Scott: I got some of them to play but they were just bad.

766
01:00:57,424 --> 01:01:07,367
Scott: Yeah unplayable I mean like you I could get them to run and function but some we couldn't get to function Some we couldn't get to function or some there was only a server and we couldn't find the client.

767
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:14,250
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so anyone out there knows any open source games besides Wesnoth that are good and worth playing?

768
01:01:15,074 --> 01:01:15,458
Scott: Let us know.

769
01:01:15,478 --> 01:01:16,449
Scott: I mean, I know a few of them.

770
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:17,755
Scott: There's like is a few.

771
01:01:17,855 --> 01:01:21,789
Scott: our FPS is out there that are pretty good, but it's not much else.

772
01:01:22,732 --> 01:01:23,960
Rym: I highly recommend this game.

773
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:30,140
Rym: if you have trouble with it Try playing one of the easy scenarios or maybe read some of the instructions So you'll learn how to actually play.

774
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:31,430
Rym: there are instructions in the game.

775
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:35,503
Scott: Yeah, if you do what's the one campaign that's supposed to be the main campaign?

776
01:01:35,964 --> 01:01:37,650
Rym: why that would be heir to the throne?

777
01:01:38,003 --> 01:01:57,661
Scott: Yes So if you've never played this game before you probably want to play at least the first half of the heir to the throne campaign because that's the original one that tells you how to play in the early missions and It takes you know, it gives you progressively more and more stuff, you know It's like oh here starting this easy Mission where you just have to walk to the other end of the map.

778
01:01:57,802 --> 01:02:01,580
Rym: see though at the same time that campaign later on Gets a little bit arbitrary and annoying.

779
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,422
Scott: it is I didn't like it's not the best campaign I will agree, but if you've never played it is the learning camp.

780
01:02:06,482 --> 01:02:06,683
Scott: Yes.

781
01:02:06,843 --> 01:02:23,852
Rym: However, the South Guard especially if you set it to one of the easier difficulties is also an excellent learning campaign because it starts you with just peasants and then you get other units from there and The South Guard will teach you how to play the game if you are smart enough to take a cue from the game and look At what's going

782
01:02:24,012 --> 01:02:24,093
Scott: on?

783
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:27,905
Scott: Yeah, the tale of two brothers is the incredibly short and easy campaign.

784
01:02:27,925 --> 01:02:28,768
Scott: I talked about before.

785
01:02:29,009 --> 01:02:30,795
Rym: Yes Play this game.

786
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:34,286
Rym: I almost guarantee if you like turn-based strategy games at all.

787
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:35,430
Rym: You'll like Wesnoth.

788
01:02:35,771 --> 01:02:38,099
Rym: Yeah, you're not a human being and you like shitty games.

789
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,709
Scott: If you like fantasy war games, you'll also like this.

790
01:02:40,749 --> 01:02:41,130
Scott: probably.

791
01:02:41,473 --> 01:02:42,480
Rym: Yeah, now granted.

792
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,810
Rym: It doesn't have to be fantasy.

793
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:45,937
Rym: The system is set up to be that way.

794
01:02:46,178 --> 01:02:49,289
Rym: you could reskin this game and redo it to make it spaceships fighting.

795
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:53,160
Scott: if you want It you could make it freakin blobs of goo versus.

796
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:56,450
Rym: well, it is in fact blobs of goo in one of the campaigns.

797
01:02:57,151 --> 01:03:00,102
Rym: It's true I haven't played through much of that one yet.

798
01:03:00,223 --> 01:03:00,504
Scott: Yeah.

799
01:03:00,885 --> 01:03:05,803
Rym: Also if you go to the Wikipedia I'll warn you some of the campaigns have better art than other ones.

800
01:03:06,084 --> 01:03:07,610
Rym: That's just through the fact that it's open source.

801
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:12,473
Rym: So if you're a good artist out there if you want to make a little bit of a name for yourself You don't have one yet.

802
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:14,501
Rym: submit art to Wesnoth.

803
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,750
Rym: if you're good, they'll take it and they'll put it in the game.

804
01:03:16,931 --> 01:03:19,726
Scott: Yeah, you should see the art and some of the older versions of Wesnoth.

805
01:03:19,766 --> 01:03:31,549
Scott: Oh god, basically It's like the game had art, you know had icons for all the units and everything and then they slowly go through like, you know One at a time making things better and then they just make things better in random places.

806
01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:32,108
Scott: one You know.

807
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:36,390
Scott: It's the nature of an open-source game and the game is constantly coming out with new versions.

808
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:44,790
Scott: One thing that is annoying is if you don't have the same exact version as all your friends You can't play against each other because like right now I've got feisty fawn.

809
01:03:45,191 --> 01:03:49,947
Scott: So my version of Wesnoth is like super new and everyone else is still running edgy EFT.

810
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:53,217
Rym: Yeah Only ever a problem.

811
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:59,362
Scott: if you decide to run beta versions of Linux operating system Well, you have to because they all the ones don't work on your laptop as well.

812
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:02,756
Rym: Yeah, Scott because of you We couldn't play some Wesnoth.

813
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:03,641
Scott: What you gonna do?

814
01:04:03,661 --> 01:04:05,450
Scott: It's not my fault using the old busted.

815
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:06,997
Scott: Well, you know what?

816
01:04:07,037 --> 01:04:07,519
Scott: We did.

817
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:09,247
Rym: we just played Wesnoth without you.

818
01:04:09,267 --> 01:04:09,950
Scott: That's fine.

819
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:16,329
Rym: I have more important things to do like laundry, but I say this because on the Wikipedia page I might go edit this but I'll wait so you can all see it.

820
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:22,190
Rym: There is a picture of a lich and I gotta say it's one of the silliest looking liches I've ever seen.

821
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:23,637
Scott: Yeah, another thing was not.

822
01:04:23,757 --> 01:04:26,190
Scott: actually I don't know who made the music, but it's not bad.

823
01:04:26,632 --> 01:04:28,640
Rym: It's also gotten a lot better recently.

824
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,689
Scott: Yeah, the music has been changed and is better.

825
01:04:30,729 --> 01:04:31,572
Scott: now It's still.

826
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:38,654
Scott: it's not the kind of music that you'll be like dancing to and it's not super awesome like the civilization music But it's getting there.

827
01:04:39,216 --> 01:04:43,210
Scott: It's definitely to the point where it's not annoying and you won't just turn it off in frustration.

828
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:51,748
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
