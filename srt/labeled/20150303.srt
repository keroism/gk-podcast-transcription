1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,093
Rym: It's Tuesday March 3rd 2015.

2
00:00:12,093 --> 00:00:12,614
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:18,330
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight the games we played at Pac South so long ago.

4
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:23,522
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,072 --> 00:00:35,415
Rym: You know we had a long hiatus after Pac South for a lot of reasons and It's weird that we're finally talking about Pac South Literally like before.

6
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:36,919
Rym: I pack for Pacs East.

7
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:38,102
Scott: yeah, I got a pack tomorrow.

8
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:39,766
Rym: Yeah, too many packs is?

9
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:43,301
Scott: I had a dream And it was real really.

10
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:48,182
Scott: yeah, I remembered that Captain Jack's entire discography is on Spotify.

11
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:49,226
Rym: Oh shit.

12
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:52,107
Rym: Oh Shit, you're Captain Jack.

13
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:55,756
Scott: You get what I get your autograph.

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,024
Rym: Oh my god Captain Jack.

15
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:02,818
Rym: man You know what I I you know what.

16
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:05,629
Rym: I just realized the same thing you realize a little while ago.

17
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,279
Rym: I'm gonna do well.

18
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,023
Rym: I'm well.

19
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:10,451
Rym: I'm working on shit tonight Jack.

20
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:15,490
Rym: so you know what I got in my hand something you haven't gotten to use yet our special enforcer badges.

21
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:16,376
Scott: Oh, that's right.

22
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:16,798
Scott: I remember.

23
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:17,201
Scott: I forgot.

24
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:18,489
Scott: I thought I lost it, but I guess I know.

25
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,944
Rym: Because this was the first packs we could use them legitimately because we weren't enforcers at South.

26
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:29,806
Rym: okay, so uh yeah It's packs time and we'll talk about that later, so I got any news.

27
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:30,670
Rym: It's a gaming day.

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,780
Rym: We haven't talked about games in a while.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,910
Scott: You know GDC is happening.

30
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,670
Scott: You think there'd be a ton of gaming news, but actually I didn't see anything worth talking.

31
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,216
Rym: GDC is not for the.

32
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,725
Scott: Usually things still happen there that were every year past of GeekNights.

33
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,110
Scott: you can find probably an episode.

34
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,366
Scott: We talked about some news from GDC, but I haven't seen any at all date night.

35
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:49,587
Rym: I chose.

36
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:51,939
Scott: They're like doing stuff We have nothing to talk about with it.

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,503
Rym: No we don't.

38
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:54,760
Rym: uh News from GDC?

39
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,172
Rym: wow there is literally Nothing.

40
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,135
Rym: the biggest gaming news.

41
00:01:58,195 --> 00:02:02,210
Rym: I could find is that you know valve is not holding a press conference today.

42
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:03,937
Scott: Bigot new flat news flash.

43
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,660
Scott: there is no news.

44
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,190
Scott: Yeah, geo g.com is having a sale right now.

45
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:21,142
Scott: They've done this a few times before I think where they sell games like ridiculously low prices like even lower than the usual Ridiculousness, but in limited quantities, so it'll be like this $50 game is five bucks But only like 20 people can get it for five bucks.

46
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,190
Scott: and as soon as 20 people buy five bucks Then they switch it to a different game.

47
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:31,030
Rym: I think I know why there's no news out of GDC this year because PAX East is like in a few days.

48
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:35,349
Rym: Yeah, I think they're gonna coincide the announcements with PAX East sounds good to me?

49
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:38,299
Scott: Yeah, whatever, so I want to talk about.

50
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,668
Scott: I do some geek bite who a geek by game.

51
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:45,780
Scott: I've been playing recently Skeleton clicker also known as el Diablo.

52
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:46,682
Rym: is this?

53
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:48,046
Rym: oh wait a minute.

54
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,310
Rym: You're talking about Diablo aren't you?

55
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,743
Rym: Okay, I was like who is it like how?

56
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:59,470
Scott: the last time we talked about this game We were talking about you know the real money auction house garbage, and now you should never play this horrible game.

57
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:02,869
Scott: That shit was removed actually quite a long time ago by now.

58
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:06,985
Rym: It is kind of sad and interesting that I cared so little.

59
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,170
Rym: I didn't pay attention to that.

60
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:13,470
Scott: I only got the game because there was some ridiculous sale that like Blizzard ever has a sale.

61
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,330
Rym: I think I have the game too But I don't think I paid for it.

62
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:22,657
Scott: They had a big old sale and you got the game and the expansion and a whole bunch of garbage whatever for like way less Than the usual price.

63
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,587
Scott: so then I found a friend to play it with.

64
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,088
Scott: so We're just in clicking on skeletons.

65
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:31,770
Scott: and Yeah, everything I've said about el Diablo in the past is still true.

66
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:39,256
Scott: You literally do nothing in this game But click on skeletons, and if you're about to die run away and push the health potion button And then click on skeletons again.

67
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,790
Scott: perhaps click on some demons perhaps click on some ghosts or something?

68
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:43,235
Scott: I don't know.

69
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:48,967
Scott: you just click on bad guys And then it makes it really easy to optimize your equipment even more than the old days.

70
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:49,408
Scott: cuz like.

71
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:50,814
Rym: What did Dave say?

72
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,319
Rym: cuz David it's weird you know.

73
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:55,390
Rym: so lately Dave and Joel have been on fast karate.

74
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,540
Rym: I've been talking about a lot of the things we talked about like.

75
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,816
Rym: we've just both been covering like the same anime and the same games and things like weirdly and We basically been saying the same thing.

76
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:10,544
Rym: so they were just talking about this and saying a lot of the things that we're saying right Now yeah like it'll tell you you know on an item.

77
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,669
Scott: Let's say you find a hammer.

78
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:17,743
Scott: It'll be like strength plus 30 with this hammer and okay What does that really mean though?

79
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:18,670
Scott: well down on the bottom?

80
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,673
Scott: It'll show you like.

81
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,420
Scott: well that will increase your damage.

82
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:31,428
Scott: this if you equip this item instead of the item you have now Your damage will go up by 30% Your toughness will go down by this percent your healing will go up or down by this percent etc.

83
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:31,528
Scott: etc.

84
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:36,529
Scott: so You only need to look at that you can completely ignore all the other numbers.

85
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:40,407
Scott: So I'm playing a wizard II who's pretty much a glass cannon wizard II.

86
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:43,182
Scott: yeah Far away from anything that can kill you.

87
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:45,232
Rym: get someone else to tank I believe.

88
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:49,929
Scott: do as much range damage as possible then run away and continue to do so perhaps.

89
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,630
Scott: So I only care about increasing damage, so there's really not any thinking that goes into this game.

90
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,576
Scott: It's pretty much just the story.

91
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:57,977
Scott: wait.

92
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,061
Rym: That's the same strategy.

93
00:04:59,101 --> 00:04:59,462
Rym: I used in.

94
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:00,746
Rym: one must fall 2097. just increase damage.

95
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,244
Rym: Don't care about anything else right?

96
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:07,470
Scott: so It's just the story pretty much in this game other than clicking on the skeleton.

97
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,117
Rym: So I'm gonna go get to y'all.

98
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:09,538
Rym: I got him.

99
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,169
Scott: Yeah, the story is pretty much that.

100
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:17,163
Scott: But for some reason like you sort of care, but I do.

101
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:19,230
Scott: there's one giant plot hole that I don't understand.

102
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:20,293
Scott: Is that?

103
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:20,694
Scott: you know?

104
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,499
Scott: it's about like heaven's.

105
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:23,682
Scott: real hell is real.

106
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:25,567
Scott: There's demons in hell.

107
00:05:25,587 --> 00:05:26,610
Scott: There's angels in heaven.

108
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:33,513
Scott: They're all really wicked powerful, but somehow thanks to grinding you're even more powerful Dude.

109
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:34,477
Rym: see also D&D.

110
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:41,083
Scott: I mean once you get level 20 like you're already much The angels and demons are fighting angels with good guys.

111
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:52,379
Scott: you're on their side even though they have some infighting issues whatever and Then you know you got to go kill all the bad guys because they all came back since Diablo 2. right Big deal.

112
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,242
Scott: the one thing I don't understand is spoilers In the last act of el diablo.

113
00:05:58,302 --> 00:05:58,684
Scott: trace.

114
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:06,955
Scott: el diablo Goes to heaven to take on heaven itself as opposed to like the end of Diablo 2 where you go into hell to get Diablo.

115
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:08,529
Rym: that's a smart move right?

116
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:13,365
Scott: The thing I don't understand is like isn't like God up there.

117
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,550
Scott: It's like he's taking all these angels.

118
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:15,595
Scott: It's like wouldn't?

119
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,549
Scott: God doesn't appear at all to do anything about this.

120
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:26,738
Rym: well Maybe this world exists in a mythology where there's a demiurge Which is like with the angels, but there is an unknowable further God that doesn't interact.

121
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:33,399
Scott: well That gnostic bullshit that is certainly likely because God ain't showing the fuck up, and it's like why do I do this?

122
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:35,283
Scott: It's like.

123
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:38,500
Scott: shouldn't you Diablo show up in heaven and God just like Scott?

124
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:46,100
Rym: Oh, yeah, Scott so think of this in medieval like images often like everything's two-dimensional partly because you know that's God's perspective on the world.

125
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:49,591
Rym: So you are God in Diablo.

126
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:52,971
Rym: you are sitting outside of the plane of this world existence.

127
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:59,773
Rym: so why with a screen Controlling an avatar just like God's doing Dungeons & Dragons.

128
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,656
Scott: That's how you want to do.

129
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:01,579
Rym: That's how I want to do.

130
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,644
Scott: alright That's one more thing.

131
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:04,252
Scott: I had to say about Diablo trace right.

132
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:10,000
Scott: It's just uh you know It's really a nothing game like you just have nothing to do and you want to click on something.

133
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,440
Scott: But yeah your brain has already used it up its willpower for the day.

134
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:14,726
Rym: Yeah, like you know you don't want it.

135
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,880
Rym: You want one step above just drawing squares on the desktop, right?

136
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:29,968
Scott: For some reason even though torchlight and torchlight 2 are the exact same fucking game as Diablo 1 2 3 Especially 2 & 3 same exact goddamn game.

137
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:30,770
Scott: the art is different.

138
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,816
Scott: Maybe yeah for some reason.

139
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:34,320
Scott: I don't know why.

140
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:43,159
Scott: Usually I know why or I can figure out why but I'm trying to figure out why and I don't understand because I went back And loaded up torchlight, and I clicked on some skeletons there.

141
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:47,860
Scott: Then I clicked on some Diablo skeletons and as far as I can tell there's no real difference.

142
00:07:49,261 --> 00:08:01,340
Scott: But for some reason me, but also other people that I know all seem to agree that it's like yeah Diablo you kind of like clicking on the skeletons and in torchlight you get bored of clicking on the skeletons really fucking fast.

143
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,494
Rym: I think it's partly that kind of like how different FPS is and it's not just like.

144
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:05,955
Scott: it's like.

145
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:07,805
Scott: I was getting plenty of loots in Both of them.

146
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:10,042
Scott: it's not the loot reward No It's the like.

147
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:19,406
Rym: when you click and you cast a spell and you hit something I think the animation and the sound and the motion Reaction just feel Like I was using guns.

148
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:20,450
Scott: It was pretty satisfying.

149
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:20,871
Scott: boom.

150
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:22,337
Rym: Yeah, I think it's just a little.

151
00:08:22,397 --> 00:08:25,437
Rym: for whatever reason It's a little more satisfying can't figure it out.

152
00:08:27,162 --> 00:08:29,273
Rym: Might also be just like a slight like frame timing.

153
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:30,540
Rym: Scott you're playing on different frames.

154
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:39,203
Scott: I have no idea what you know why the exact like pretty much this and it's not like torchlight is like some obviously Crappy jank version.

155
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,811
Scott: right it's a highly polished well-developed game.

156
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:42,854
Scott: You know good.

157
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,840
Scott: You know well programmed everything.

158
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,004
Scott: There's nothing wrong with it.

159
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,308
Scott: It's it's professionally made.

160
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:51,525
Scott: I I don't know what magic blizzard put in the Diablo.

161
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:54,619
Rym: you can't always understand the whims of the human heart.

162
00:08:54,699 --> 00:09:02,911
Scott: also I wonder sorry if I offended anyone like you know anyone who speaks Spanish by always saying El Diablo But Scott's done this as long as I've known him.

163
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:11,466
Scott: I wonder if in Spanish-speaking countries is it called Satan three Or or devil three?

164
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:14,056
Scott: I am sure the Al's above three.

165
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:17,480
Rym: I am confident It's just called Diablo, but I haven't looked this up.

166
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,085
Rym: So I'm not a hundred percent sure.

167
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:22,939
Scott: and would we get in trouble if we made a game called like Satan three?

168
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,275
Rym: I'll bet we could get away with making a game just called Satan.

169
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,808
Rym: all right I wonder if there is a game already called Satan.

170
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:31,380
Rym: I mean, there's Satan's hollow sure, but that's not Satan.

171
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:35,494
Scott: You should make Satan's hollow - where you electric boogaloo.

172
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,020
Scott: Yeah, you click on the bridge.

173
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:57,172
Rym: So I did a livestream last night kind of on a sudden whim Because I got home from doing a bunch of stuff and I was supposed to be working on of all things I've been making for like a couple weeks now a really long sort of Mechanical explanation of five nights at Freddy's like the first one.

174
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,980
Rym: It's got this freaking game.

175
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:01,837
Rym: They're really good at being a horror game.

176
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:04,899
Scott: This is a game I needed to play for like five minutes and never needs to look at again.

177
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:08,160
Scott: Yeah, when you're like obsessed with it so much you're making a crazy long video.

178
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:20,240
Rym: I am and it's a really good video but so I've been kind of like playing one to analyze and be able to talk about it and all this stuff and making this Long video and I sit down to finish that video because it's almost done.

179
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:28,353
Rym: And then I see a bunch of people tween about five nights at Freddy's 3 because it came out suddenly like it Scott I think people I think people knew it was coming.

180
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:28,494
Scott: Well.

181
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:29,600
Rym: No we knew it was coming.

182
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,111
Scott: We didn't know when that guy seems to be cranking him out.

183
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:32,633
Scott: I don't know.

184
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:36,628
Rym: Scott Cawthorne is Already in my mind a genius.

185
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:37,249
Rym: Here's why.

186
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,974
Rym: why prolific so prolific?

187
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:39,155
Rym: well?

188
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:41,404
Rym: No he made other guy I'm gonna read.

189
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:43,720
Rym: I'm gonna quote Wikipedia because it tells the story.

190
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:44,645
Rym: I don't know.

191
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:49,387
Rym: I haven't verified this story 100% but Wikipedia has to take it at that quote.

192
00:10:49,988 --> 00:11:05,419
Rym: the idea for five nights at Freddy's stems from the negative reception towards Scott Cawthorne's previous game the family-friendly chipper and sons lumber company where players ridiculed the main character a young beaver as Looking like a quote scary animatronic animal.

193
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:09,900
Rym: Jim Sterling called the game unintentionally terrifying.

194
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:24,479
Rym: Although initially depressed by the poor reception to chipper and sons Cawthorne who had previously developed a chipper and sons Christianity oriented games Eventually used it to inspire himself to make something intentionally scarier, and that's when he made five nights at Freddy's.

195
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,751
Scott: So this guy's like a big holy roller here.

196
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:27,495
Rym: I don't know.

197
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:28,540
Rym: I don't know much about him.

198
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:45,819
Rym: I haven't done a lot of research on him I've only been focusing on the game, but so five nights at Freddy's just became virally Ridiculously successful, but in this weird like sharded off world It's like there's one corner of the internet where everybody's obsessed with this game and knows everything about it.

199
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:54,366
Scott: And I mean there's some corner of the internet where people are still crazy about Ultima big corner Like you run into.

200
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:57,498
Rym: you know like like go to a patch like everyone's like oh my god five nights at Freddy's.

201
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:04,419
Rym: like you see Some cosplay, but then you like talk about it at another packs and literally no one in the room had even heard of it.

202
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:15,660
Rym: so Anyway, the three came out and I tweeted kind of like ha Would anyone care if I just bought it and live-streamed it right now and a ton of listeners were like fucking do it.

203
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,223
Rym: So I did it.

204
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:17,650
Scott: Yeah, we won't have to pay for that shit.

205
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,132
Scott: You do it.

206
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:19,700
Rym: So it was interesting.

207
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:26,280
Rym: I played five nights at Freddy's 3 Literally knowing nothing about it and just kind of completely blind.

208
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:38,080
Rym: So basically I did for three what I said You should have done for one watching other people play these games is the wrong way to experience them Unless you're watching your excitable friend play them like at a party.

209
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:43,220
Rym: And then Kate couldn't even take it and gave the controller back to me and forced me to play it, but I digress.

210
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,680
Rym: So I played five nights at Freddy's 3 and I kind of reviewed it as I was playing it.

211
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,082
Rym: You know what?

212
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:50,272
Rym: It's the second best of the games.

213
00:12:50,594 --> 00:12:51,598
Rym: It's really good at what it does.

214
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,703
Rym: It's worth playing.

215
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:56,632
Rym: if you like these kinds of games just buy it and play it.

216
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,100
Rym: don't watch like markiplier.

217
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,073
Rym: Those people play it on YouTube.

218
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,619
Rym: play it yourself You know like those PewDiePie types.

219
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:08,009
Rym: So just play it and it's kind of fun.

220
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:08,310
Rym: and it.

221
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:12,168
Rym: it actually got me a couple times too, you know I knew it was a jump scare.

222
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:13,800
Rym: I'm like, alright, this game is a jump scare game.

223
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:18,020
Rym: Oh, I bet a jump scare is coming now and I lean back like I'm not gonna get jump scared.

224
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:18,786
Rym: That's stupid.

225
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,440
Rym: and then it doesn't jump scare me.

226
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,538
Rym: Okay, and I lean in and then it jump scares like the moment I lean in.

227
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,978
Scott: You just jump scare of like when?

228
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,796
Scott: There's not pot like you couldn't possibly expect it like like you.

229
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:31,620
Scott: check all the cameras.

230
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:34,469
Scott: You see all the guys are like totally where they belong.

231
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,115
Scott: Yeah, put the camera away jump scare.

232
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:39,164
Rym: Yeah, so I actually Not so.

233
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,134
Rym: in my video for teleported fuck you.

234
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:41,295
Scott: for

235
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:53,180
Rym: five nights at Freddy's one I talked about that because the part of the reason why it works that the game uses a series of tricks to where you figure Like you learn Oh a jump scare happens when this occurs, but then they'll be us like in the next night.

236
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,772
Rym: They'll subtly break that rule and introduce a jump scare you didn't expect.

237
00:13:57,133 --> 00:14:01,579
Rym: So when the power goes out sometimes Freddy just doesn't attack you right away.

238
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:04,260
Rym: Sometimes he doesn't attack you at all.

239
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:06,183
Rym: It becomes 6 a.m And you win the game.

240
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:12,844
Rym: does these things to trick you into getting jump scared even after you think I'm going to lean back and not Get jump scared.

241
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:13,246
Rym: Hmm.

242
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,539
Rym: So yeah, three is pretty good.

243
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:18,560
Rym: And if you're curious if you should play it just watch my live stream.

244
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,580
Rym: You'll see exactly what it's like and then you'll see enough to know if you should play the rest of it or not.

245
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:24,653
Scott: You didn't beat it.

246
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:32,599
Rym: now I got to the fourth night in a blind play and then it was like midnight and I really had to go to bed Hmm, and I really needed my heart to stop beating so fast.

247
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:40,290
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

248
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,614
Rym: Someone tweeted this.

249
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:44,159
Rym: I think it was Nahasha Allegri.

250
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:50,657
Rym: I'm not I don't remember but it's quite internet thing and I Was suddenly reminded that this existed.

251
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:57,955
Rym: so the Super Mario Brothers Super Show was pretty pretty good at being what it was I guess.

252
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:06,781
Rym: of all the episodes in that show There was one that I saw once when I was many on sin And I did not like.

253
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:13,890
Rym: I had vague memories of it But I couldn't remember anything that happened in it and I wasn't really sure if it existed or if I'd made it up.

254
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:18,210
Rym: There was no internet back then so I couldn't like find a list of episodes or anything.

255
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,899
Rym: So I forgot about it now years later.

256
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,910
Rym: I realized what it was and I was reminded of it the other day.

257
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:38,122
Rym: I submit to you the Super Mario Brothers Super Show episode entitled bad rap where Every character raps the entire time Badly and there's a like rap beat.

258
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:42,876
Scott: Well, this is the early 90s when like MC Hammer was the shit.

259
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:46,004
Scott: Yeah, big deal this hit the mainstream.

260
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:49,774
Rym: This is amazing and Terrifying.

261
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:51,710
Rym: I dare you to watch the whole thing.

262
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:58,499
Scott: Yeah, oh My friend cookie must.

263
00:15:59,041 --> 00:15:59,984
Scott: he came to my city.

264
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:05,427
Scott: actually he lives in New York City Yeah, but anyway, he went over to Manhattan where he doesn't live.

265
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:08,981
Scott: He lives in Queens And he visited el museums.

266
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:10,410
Scott: They're all pretty close to each other.

267
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,778
Scott: The big ones the MoMA the met the Guggenheim.

268
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,765
Scott: he visited them and while he was there.

269
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,409
Scott: He learned many things.

270
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:28,630
Scott: he enlightened himself Thanks to all the magnificent artworks And he shared those enlightening discoveries with us people.

271
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:42,729
Scott: So if you need to be enlightened By the Cookie Monster and you don't live in New York and you can't go to these museums like just on a whim like people live in New York can You might need Cookie Monster to enlighten you about why you should move to New York.

272
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:47,480
Rym: My favorite part about that is in the Guggenheim.

273
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,563
Rym: He doesn't say anything.

274
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:50,629
Rym: his facial expression says it all.

275
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:51,836
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

276
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:53,223
Rym: That was a good a good little bit there.

277
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:56,769
Scott: I mean also Why you should have googly eyes.

278
00:16:57,377 --> 00:16:58,248
Rym: Googly eyes are pretty good.

279
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:01,182
Scott: It's a pretty much make everything better in the meta moment.

280
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:03,130
Rym: The book club book is still water ship down.

281
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,777
Rym: It's about rabbits on an adventure.

282
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:05,682
Rym: It's kind of important.

283
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:07,530
Rym: a lot of nerds have read it a lot of nerdy things.

284
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,595
Rym: We're inspired by it.

285
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:11,589
Scott: I guess I'll read more on the PAX bus.

Rym: well now it is the up up actually because there's air animals land animals sea animals.

305
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,877
Rym: We're not all the way down in the cuttlefish.

306
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:02,684
Scott: No, we're not into cuttlefish.

307
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:03,427
Rym: We're presenting.

308
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:04,070
Rym: What is losing?

309
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:05,210
Rym: It's gonna be fucking awesome.

310
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:18,110
Rym: If you want to find us at PAX to figure out like how to game with us or ask us a question or whatever right after going to that panel and Grabbing us as we come out of the room is pretty much your best possible chance.

311
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:20,521
Rym: Otherwise, you're gonna have to hope you run into us in tabletop.

312
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:22,350
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna be sad.

313
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:28,598
Scott: I'm gonna get one of those little signs where it's like that lets you put an eight and a half by eleven piece of paper And stand it up in a piece of plastic.

314
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:29,945
Scott: Are you sort of like an L shape?

315
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:31,392
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to staples Oh nice.

316
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:37,290
Scott: Yeah, and I'm gonna write on it pretty much like hey, you know, let's play netrunner.

317
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,769
Scott: I'm gonna put at the end of the table and tabletop when I'm sitting there.

318
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:44,410
Scott: So now it'll be easy to find us either if you want to play netrunner or not.

319
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:51,522
Scott: You can still find us by looking for a netrunner sign And we're enforcing at night at least I am.

320
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:53,169
Scott: so don't look for me after seven o'clock.

321
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,056
Rym: Yep I don't know when I'm forcing.

322
00:18:55,136 --> 00:19:02,665
Scott: come to tabletop at seven o'clock or later on Friday or Saturday But I can't play games with you, but I can probably help you out with shit.

323
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:04,030
Rym: He can kick you out.

324
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:07,402
Scott: I can't kick you out myself, but I can definitely.

325
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:08,185
Scott: you can put in.

326
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:09,430
Scott: I can have you kicked out.

327
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:16,070
Rym: You can put into motion a process by which you will be removed only if the person does something worthy of engaging that process.

328
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:20,230
Rym: Yep, so don't show up to tabletop at night like naked and vomiting.

329
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:25,888
Scott: Don't show up with alcohol or drugs or anything that it says in the back of your packs badge not to do like.

330
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:32,764
Scott: don't punch People there, yep, I don't deal with you But you can just come and ask me questions while I'm in for salating because that's.

331
00:19:33,145 --> 00:19:42,590
Rym: and then so, you know, of course Next week once just like the last bags There won't be any shows at least not in the beginning of the week because I'm going straight from packs to London.

332
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,885
Rym: You're first for two other events that are not related to gaming and not fun.

333
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:52,562
Scott: if you live in London If you live in the crown jewels and bring them to me.

334
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:55,935
Rym: if you want to hang out in London Do that.

335
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,561
Scott: Well, how come you're not as good as Lupin?

336
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:59,890
Scott: Why do you suck next Wednesday morning?

337
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,037
Rym: I might have a bunch of free time.

338
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:02,770
Rym: We could grab like breakfast or brunch or something.

339
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,028
Scott: There must be like a nerdy place to go in London like a comic shop or a gaming.

340
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:07,434
Rym: Oh, yeah I've been alone enough.

341
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:14,416
Scott: I know a bunch of stuff to do or a tabletop cafe kind of place You know bicycle bike shop.

342
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:18,910
Rym: Yeah, so at Pac South we played South by the packs.

343
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,935
Scott: East is this weekend.

344
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:22,328
Scott: Pac South was weekends ago.

345
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:23,192
Rym: now We're not.

346
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:28,296
Rym: I mean, we're gonna do a show later to review San Antonio But a Thursday show.

347
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:32,610
Rym: we don't need to do a whole show on reviewing Pac South because Pac South was a pax.

348
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:35,004
Rym: It was equivalent to PAX Australia.

349
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:38,458
Scott: It was a real time Bigger than the first packs, Australia.

350
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,342
Rym: Oh, yeah.

351
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:39,804
Rym: It was well.

352
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:41,350
Rym: Yeah, you didn't go to the second PAX Australia.

353
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,682
Rym: It is the same as the normal PAX Australia the second packs.

354
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:47,085
Rym: Yes, though the one that you didn't go to.

355
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,381
Rym: Okay, and It was a packs.

356
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:58,378
Rym: It was great And honestly if you had to choose like if you had to drop up if you had to choose two paxes to go to I would say go to Australia and prime.

357
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:01,810
Rym: if you had to choose three, I'd say Australia Prime and South.

358
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,403
Rym: I'd put East last only because not because East is not good.

359
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:07,310
Rym: No, but because you can't get a fucking hotel room.

360
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:09,881
Scott: Yeah, and I was already Western there's nowhere to eat.

361
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:16,107
Scott: It's nothing about the packs itself at East It's just that like it's East is like the even though we live really close to East.

362
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:26,173
Rym: It's the closest one Yeah, it's the most inconvenient one because it is easier to get to and get hotels for pax prime and Australia Than pax East.

363
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:26,674
Scott: Yes.

364
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:34,003
Scott: Anyway, yeah, so, you know Pac South was a pax, you know We spent most of it playing games like you do.

365
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:42,670
Scott: one interesting thing Was that like the tabletop was really big maybe huge maybe the biggest tabletop of any pegs and it wasn't super crowded.

366
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:47,003
Scott: The attendance wasn't like prime or East level attendance.

367
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,467
Scott: Yeah, it was still sold out.

368
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:56,788
Scott: Yeah yet is right It was the first year of a new packs in a dent not so densely populated area of the world You know, Texas a big flat.

369
00:21:57,036 --> 00:22:01,635
Rym: Yeah The only thing that was very interesting that I kind of want to mention is that you know It didn't.

370
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:05,450
Rym: really it's sold out I think like right at the end like it didn't sell out up until the con.

371
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:14,806
Scott: Yeah You could get badges for two of the days or almost right up until the number of people within Geographic distance of San Antonio who are nerds and want to go to a pax and what is not.

372
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:33,090
Rym: based on my completely anecdotal entirely biased personal experience the demographic of pax prime is everyone who's a gamer who can get there like people I from Everywhere like in fact the average person I meet at pax prime is not from anywhere near Seattle.

373
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:40,704
Rym: It's always people from New York and Europe and just like Canada It's a bit like the same percentage of Greek people in Astoria.

374
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,210
Scott: Astoria is still a Greek neighborhood.

375
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,390
Scott: There's still plenty of Greek people.

376
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:50,235
Scott: They own most of the real estate like the buildings and shit, but the majority of people there are not Greeks It's just enough.

377
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:50,636
Scott: They're just.

378
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:53,529
Scott: they just sort of outnumber any other individual group.

379
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:54,954
Scott: So there's the same thing.

380
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,178
Scott: like you go to pax prime.

381
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:03,349
Scott: Washingtonians aren't the majority at the pax at least only having badges But they outnumber any other individual group.

382
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,158
Scott: There's still the most of them.

383
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:11,761
Rym: pax East seems to be in my experience Mostly people from New York Boston and Washington.

384
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:14,990
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much you're gonna get even amounts from all over the Northeast.

385
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:28,330
Scott: You're also gonna get some more Europeans and some less Australians and other types because But you're gonna get an increase relative percentage wise of people from Seattle Washington area because that's the pax area.

386
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:40,730
Rym: Yup, so pax Australia was mostly Australians and foreign people who work in the games industry Of course and top-tier Lot of Kiwis and a lot of people from Europe actually.

387
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:45,310
Scott: But well, you also get at pax south even when I was there I was saying I said Australia.

388
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:45,571
Rym: No,

389
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:57,365
Scott: but I'm saying I had quite a few like Chinese Japanese true Southeast Asia street passes because you know If you speak English and you're up there pax out pretty close,

390
00:23:57,707 --> 00:24:08,279
Rym: but seriously I feel like the majority of people I interacted with at pax south where they lived in San Antonio Or drove there from somewhere nearby.

391
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:10,385
Rym: Yes, and had only one day bad.

392
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:13,355
Scott: Yep, Dallas, Houston Phoenix those types.

393
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:22,630
Rym: so I feel like pax south is pretty much people who can't afford to get into other pax I think it was some Oklahoma or can't get badges or hotels for other paxes.

394
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:25,990
Scott: Yeah, I think I picked up the Oklahoma Street pass, which is the one I did not have.

395
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:30,550
Rym: Yeah So but as a result It's way easier to get into pax south than say pax east.

396
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:34,450
Rym: Like it's easier for me to go to pax south than to go to pax east despite living in New York.

397
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:40,630
Rym: Yeah, and if I had to choose between them, I'd go to south because there's way more room in tabletop and there's way more restaurant.

398
00:24:41,411 --> 00:24:43,559
Scott: Yes, it was way easy to eat there.

399
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:44,623
Rym: Yeah way good food.

400
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:46,290
Rym: Well, you have relatively good food nearby.

401
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:48,159
Scott: Yeah, it's not New York food.

402
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,124
Rym: So we played a bunch of games.

403
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:50,270
Rym: We talked about the games we played.

404
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:57,217
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know since there wasn't so much at the pax we've spent of course a lot of time gaming Yeah, and there wasn't anything in San Antonio.

405
00:24:57,398 --> 00:24:59,565
Scott: So there wasn't much San Antonio is.

406
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,130
Scott: there wasn't more than a day's worth.

407
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:08,050
Rym: There is one point three days worth of shit to do in San Antonio if you stretch it and you don't have a car.

408
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,413
Rym: Yeah two full days.

409
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:17,993
Scott: if you have a car and you spend a lot of that time like watching a whole movie or a whole night of viewing at the Alamo Drafthouse.

410
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:18,535
Rym: Oh my god.

411
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:22,430
Rym: I'm glad we didn't go to that anime thing though, cuz that looked pretty like booby scary.

412
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,237
Scott: Yeah, well Funimation was doing it.

413
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:24,919
Scott: I think whatever.

414
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,903
Rym: Yeah, but it wasn't.

415
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:26,807
Rym: it wasn't good.

416
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:29,736
Scott: No anyway Anyway, so what games did we play?

417
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:30,558
Rym: We played though?

418
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:32,343
Rym: I didn't play but I watched them play.

419
00:25:32,704 --> 00:25:34,028
Rym: Sheriff of Nottingham.

420
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,770
Scott: Ah Who is the sheriff?

421
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:37,586
Rym: I will be.

422
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,978
Rym: It's like a lying bluffing game, you know, like.

423
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,024
Scott: maybe the person played it should explain it.

424
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:53,089
Scott: Okay, so basically On your turn right you're gonna sort of you have a hand of cards and You're sort of putting cards into this bag actually comes a little bag.

425
00:25:53,210 --> 00:26:01,662
Scott: Yeah We feel like really Snappy buttons and you're basically trying to get your goods into Nottingham and the sheriff is that someone's the sheriff and they're at the gate.

426
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:03,228
Scott: so you take turns being the sheriff.

427
00:26:03,248 --> 00:26:05,188
Scott: when you're the sheriff You don't do the bag thing, right?

428
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,060
Scott: Everyone puts out a bag and they tell you what's in the bag.

429
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:13,415
Scott: So they'll say like there are three Chickens in this bag.

430
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:15,101
Scott: There are four wheats in this bag.

431
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:17,850
Scott: I forget the specific goods, but it's you know goods like that, right?

432
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,269
Scott: now that may or may not be what's in the bag?

433
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,571
Scott: if It?

434
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:28,389
Scott: so if it is what's in the bag, then that's good for the person putting it in.

435
00:26:28,872 --> 00:26:30,729
Scott: But if it's not what's in the bag, it's bad for them.

436
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,687
Rym: But I come up to Scott with my bag and I'm like, there's three apples in here Scott.

437
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:37,163
Scott: now He's gonna give me three apples now.

438
00:26:37,283 --> 00:26:40,663
Scott: I have to decide Do I look in the bag or not?

439
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:41,950
Scott: look in the bag is on the sheriff.

440
00:26:42,332 --> 00:26:43,397
Scott: I choose each.

441
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:44,583
Scott: I can open all the bags.

442
00:26:44,784 --> 00:26:45,870
Scott: I can open none of the bags.

443
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,903
Scott: It's completely up to me if I'm gonna open the bag or not.

444
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:50,350
Scott: Each bag has a snap on it.

445
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,273
Rym: Yeah The game is really good.

446
00:26:51,353 --> 00:27:01,689
Scott: rules about like once the snap is on is latched by the player They cannot unlatch it and as soon as the sheriff unlatches it they've made their decision to open it.

447
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,699
Rym: Yep, or like a sheriff it close again.

448
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:06,454
Rym: if the sheriff hands the bag back to you It's gone.

449
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:08,044
Rym: you can't ask for it again, right?

450
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:08,466
Scott: That's it.

451
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:12,061
Scott: So You know the sheriff opens the bag.

452
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:17,868
Scott: if in the bag are The goods that you said were in there then the sheriff opened it.

453
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:20,196
Scott: The sheriff has to give you money like oops.

454
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:20,537
Scott: Sorry.

455
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:21,279
Scott: I opened your bag.

456
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:26,877
Scott: if the goods that are not correct Right, then the sheriff opens it.

457
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:28,622
Scott: you get in trouble, right?

458
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:31,130
Scott: So, you know, that's how it works.

459
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:37,150
Scott: And of course if the sheriff doesn't open the bag you just sneak all the goods through whether they're good or not.

460
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:39,690
Rym: Yeah, it was actually three crossbows.

461
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:50,370
Scott: Yeah, so there's legit goods like apples and stuff But there's also not legit goods like crossbows and gems and all sorts of illicit.

462
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:54,868
Scott: You know contraband the contraband are worth way more fucking points.

463
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,981
Scott: now It's really all about sneaking through contraband.

464
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:00,090
Scott: is the whole game is how much contraband?

465
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:00,974
Scott: Can you sneak through?

466
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:03,950
Scott: because wow, you're gonna get a lot more points if you sneak through contraband.

467
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:07,043
Rym: It's just a really like awesome fun bluffing game.

468
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:08,128
Scott: Yeah, it's very just.

469
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:12,864
Scott: straight up You know put stuff in the bag bluff mess with the person who's the sheriff.

470
00:28:12,944 --> 00:28:15,787
Scott: also be really good at being the sheriff and tell Who's lying and who's not?

471
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:24,590
Scott: People can also bribe you like yo I will give you some money if you don't open my bag or I will give you money to open rims back.

472
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:27,459
Rym: You can make pretty much almost any deal you want.

473
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,690
Scott: you can think about this mathematically right and to where it's like.

474
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,489
Scott: Okay, if the sheriff opens my bag, I'll lose this much money.

475
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:37,357
Scott: So I'll give the sheriff half of what.

476
00:28:37,397 --> 00:28:41,310
Scott: this person who is the sheriff right now is a losing is player who's not doing well.

477
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:49,298
Scott: So giving them half of my profit margin on my illicit good Is not going to hurt me very much.

478
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,630
Scott: I can make a binding agreement with them for something immediate.

479
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:53,617
Scott: So I'll give that.

480
00:28:53,637 --> 00:28:55,470
Scott: I'll be like half my profit is three.

481
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:57,602
Scott: I will give you three to not open my bag.

482
00:28:58,205 --> 00:29:00,919
Scott: if they don't agree Well, they'll open my bag and I'll be screwed.

483
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:04,689
Scott: Anyway, if they do accept it, okay I'll cut my profit margin in half.

484
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:08,527
Scott: but at least I will you know get something out of it.

485
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:12,062
Scott: and Giving them three is no big deal because they're losing so whatever.

486
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:13,850
Rym: I mean, it's just a really solid game.

487
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,550
Rym: Why don't you play it a bunch more probably do a very like deep down?

488
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,000
Scott: You might do a whole episode on it.

489
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:18,968
Scott: So that will leave it at that.

490
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:25,670
Rym: So the other big god German style board game we played was navigator navigator, I really like navigator.

491
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,770
Rym: I tried to buy it, but you can't get it on Amazon.

492
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:30,762
Rym: So I'm gonna have to go to the strat and probably pay full price for it.

493
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:31,445
Scott: I plow.

494
00:29:31,585 --> 00:29:34,863
Scott: well next time I'm there I'll let you know if I see it there.

495
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:36,233
Rym: if you see it there I'll put it in.

496
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:39,410
Rym: I'll just buy it from you unless the guy wants like more than a hundred bucks.

497
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:39,917
Scott: I don't know.

498
00:29:39,957 --> 00:29:40,728
Scott: they charge a lot there.

499
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:45,049
Scott: So this is a game that's you know, it's really hard.

500
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:54,740
Rym: It has the same brain feel as games like imagine Endecker crossed with Puerto Rico sort of like that kind of guy.

501
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:54,921
Scott: you.

502
00:29:55,021 --> 00:29:57,308
Scott: it's got cool parts where you're moving boats around.

503
00:29:57,349 --> 00:29:57,750
Scott: That's the fun.

504
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,638
Rym: It's got really good mechanics around.

505
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:01,546
Rym: like you can build factories or you can like.

506
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:03,955
Rym: there's sort of like this Commodities market in the game.

507
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:08,568
Rym: some people profit if people are selling a lot and then other people profit.

508
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:13,410
Rym: if people are Refining a lot and selling or refining kind of push the meter in the opposite direction.

509
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:19,508
Scott: If someone buys a bunch of goods because they want them, you know, because they need them for stuff Then the price will go up.

510
00:30:19,911 --> 00:30:25,390
Scott: So if you're producing those goods that the price just went up for and you sell them then you'll get more money.

511
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:29,797
Scott: But then of course if you start selling a bunch of them and putting more in the market The price will go down.

512
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:32,530
Scott: and it's sort of like power the bottom of power grid.

513
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:39,111
Scott: only if the bottom of power grid were controlled by player actions and not just sort of this automatic thing that happens every turn on a Schedule.

514
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:42,962
Rym: but more importantly it's a rondell game rondo.

515
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:49,569
Rym: I'm a big fan of rondell games ever since NTK and The rondell kind of makes it Yeah.

516
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:57,930
Scott: If you didn't have the rondell This game would be way too Like super easy because you can just take the perfect action every turn like in Puerto Rico.

517
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,064
Scott: You can just take the action you want unless someone took it already in this game that rondell.

518
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:04,112
Scott: pretty much there were so many turns Where it's like.

519
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:08,190
Scott: I know I'll do this action and this action of this action and I'll get to do all this.

520
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,910
Scott: It'll be super efficient perfect choice.

521
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:16,510
Scott: And then I look at the rondell and I'm like I'm gonna have to go around the rondell like three times to do all that and I could do it too.

522
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:25,090
Scott: I could do all those actions with only one trip around the rondell But I need to do them in this specific order and the rondell is made in the most evil possible fashion.

523
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:35,510
Rym: The rondell is very well designed Evilly designed and but because of the rondell the thing the thing that I think gives us I gotta play it a much more Before we really really played it once just like Sheriff Nottingham.

524
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:38,333
Rym: But the reason I want to buy it is that it shows Promise.

525
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:53,773
Rym: I have not seen in many recent games that try to have this depth of mechanics because with the rondell I think the game has a similar interplay to Hans the Teutonica where it's not so much about having a Coherent strategy.

526
00:31:54,434 --> 00:32:01,752
Rym: It's about having a tactical stretch like following a tactic and reacting to how the other players are playing The game.

527
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,119
Rym: it's a highly reactive game.

528
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,130
Rym: Yeah, but it's not an attacking game.

529
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:18,330
Scott: yeah, like if some you know you might have a really efficient move and you got planned out for three turns and then someone else Moves forward and takes your biz with their fast boats, and it's like well Okay, I guess that plan isn't gonna work, but I already moved on this rondell.

530
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:21,010
Scott: So now I need to figure out something else to do on this rondell.

531
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,689
Scott: But you know you can only really go one move on the rondell before other people do stuff.

532
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,221
Scott: So there's some things you can do I think.

533
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:28,490
Scott: to take two turns in a row though.

534
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,223
Rym: Well, you can take on navigator action if you are the navigador right.

535
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,090
Rym: yeah, but I really like it.

536
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:35,699
Rym: I can't say if it's great yet.

537
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,550
Rym: I gotta play it some more, but it's in the queue.

538
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:40,748
Rym: We played a shit ton of doom like original doom.

539
00:32:41,992 --> 00:32:43,182
Rym: Scott is terrible.

540
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:44,030
Rym: at doom deathmatch.

541
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:45,033
Scott: I'm not terrible.

542
00:32:45,154 --> 00:32:49,287
Rym: you I had like four times the number of frags you in a one-on-one.

543
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:50,190
Scott: It's not correct.

544
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,776
Rym: That is a hundred percent.

545
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:52,659
Rym: You had more.

546
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,482
Scott: you didn't have four times.

547
00:32:53,523 --> 00:32:54,627
Rym: I had so many more.

548
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:55,430
Rym: It was ridiculous.

549
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,018
Rym: I would kill you like seven, eight times in a row.

550
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:57,761
Scott: I should have taken a screenshot.

551
00:32:57,821 --> 00:32:58,163
Scott: You know what.

552
00:32:58,183 --> 00:32:58,987
Scott: there is no screenshot.

553
00:32:59,047 --> 00:32:59,489
Scott: I had more.

554
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,399
Rym: Yeah, all right all right.

555
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,190
Scott: I didn't have more, but it wasn't four times.

556
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:06,599
Rym: All right, Scott if you believe that to be true.

557
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,607
Scott: also despite me having less.

558
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:09,450
Scott: I still had many.

559
00:33:11,113 --> 00:33:11,778
Rym: Not that many.

560
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:13,170
Scott: I had many also.

561
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,334
Rym: You just had more.

562
00:33:14,354 --> 00:33:17,785
Rym: many of your kills were while I was semi-idle and setting up my control.

563
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:20,537
Scott: there were many kills when I was Idle and setting up my control.

564
00:33:20,657 --> 00:33:22,185
Rym: no there were not all right.

565
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:22,990
Scott: We're opening a menu.

566
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:32,508
Rym: If you honestly think you can stand by your doom skills, and I propose this to you Let's play some live stream doom deathmatch you and me also.

567
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:38,130
Scott: It was very disappointing to go into the PC room and not be able to get a full counter-strike game.

568
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:40,316
Rym: Oh my god That was the saddest thing ever.

569
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:45,044
Rym: we go to PC freeplay early on like Sunday morning And we're like perfect counter-strike time.

570
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,609
Rym: you sit down.

571
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,858
Rym: There's a ton of people in there.

572
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:56,336
Rym: we see sat near some people playing counter-strike And then I tried to like a tap them on the shoulder and every one of them is just playing in rando games online And it's like dudes.

573
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:57,381
Scott: There's like a LAN here.

574
00:33:57,421 --> 00:34:00,835
Scott: this server is running in this room There.

575
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:04,546
Scott: wait if you open the LAN tab there they are and why aren't you on them?

576
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:05,730
Rym: no one was on those servers.

577
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,190
Rym: There was one dude who was willing to play counter-strike.

578
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,389
Scott: We had to tell him we had to talk to him because he's sitting next to us and get him to join the server with.

579
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:18,775
Rym: And he was super cool, but everyone else was literally playing rando fucking games online silently Just like they would at home.

580
00:34:18,897 --> 00:34:20,706
Scott: also why also MOBAs?

581
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:26,795
Rym: yeah So as we got up because when we got in there a lot of counter-strike we played for like our hour And then they kicked us out.

582
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:32,429
Rym: so I remember I got up to leave and I turned around And it was a sea of people playing nothing but MOBAs.

583
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:35,596
Scott: We should go and play Skeleton clicker.

584
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:38,150
Scott: yeah, that would be a good PAX game.

585
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,059
Rym: Yeah, only if you're a rowdy and possibly drunk.

586
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:41,882
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

587
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:43,047
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

588
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:44,995
Scott: everyone be like Get the El Diablo!

589
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:45,998
Scott: Making a fun joke.

590
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,625
Rym: So we found an amazing game.

591
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:48,989
Scott: Oh no you didn't click on the skeleton.

592
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,715
Scott: What is wrong with you?

593
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:54,539
Rym: We're gonna talk about this game in more detail too But it's on the House of Iron Mouse website.

594
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,385
Rym: the game is called bring your own book.

595
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:57,770
Scott: bring your own book.

596
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,739
Scott: Do you literally bring your own book?

597
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:01,869
Rym: so everyone brings a book of their choice?

598
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,702
Rym: Okay, like a physical book printed pages.

599
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:09,277
Scott: Does it had to be nonfiction fiction C-spot run Dr.

600
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:09,659
Scott: Seuss.

601
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,029
Rym: I suggest you bring fiction I guess.

602
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:17,738
Rym: But basically what you do is it's kind of one of those like It's a game or you'll have a prompt.

603
00:35:17,758 --> 00:35:19,545
Rym: so everyone gets a prompt like I'm gonna read some.

604
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:20,990
Rym: because they gave us a cards against humanity.

605
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,136
Scott: Prompt or apples to apples.

606
00:35:22,196 --> 00:35:29,538
Rym: prom the name of an inn in a D&D campaign overheard at a LARP Something you could hear Mario.

607
00:35:29,598 --> 00:35:33,110
Scott: So with those kind of prompts this those prompts are made specifically for nerds.

608
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,410
Rym: This isn't a dialogue from an episode of a soap opera like General Hospital.

609
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:44,310
Rym: Okay, you could play words tattooed on someone's body a good warning to children an item in a police report.

610
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,558
Scott: All right, so there are cards in there.

611
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,290
Scott: you could play without nerdy all over the place.

612
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:56,297
Rym: But then the timer starts and everyone flips through their own book until they find a passage an uninterrupted passage That matches the prompt.

613
00:35:56,678 --> 00:36:01,014
Rym: and then there's rules about like the order like once you're done Everyone else has a certain amount of time.

614
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:04,385
Rym: and then much like apples to apples or cards against humanity.

615
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:06,957
Rym: Everyone reads their prompts All right.

616
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:07,501
Scott: Now, how do you vote?

617
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:08,166
Scott: who who's the?

618
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:08,590
Rym: I don't know.

619
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,774
Rym: It's we're gonna talk about.

620
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:12,324
Scott: this game is one person like the person with the prompt you.

621
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:19,104
Rym: then you're going to talk about this game Excruciating detail because it looked amazing and the people we saw getting a demo and playing it.

622
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:20,950
Rym: We're having a lot of fun.

623
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,480
Rym: They brought a ton of books with them.

624
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:29,333
Rym: I saw one guy was pointedly using the Lord of the Rings giant edition.

625
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,964
Scott: what would be the best book to use?

626
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:36,198
Scott: with that I Mean like like seriously like.

627
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:41,543
Scott: it has to be a book that would produce Hilarious results that would score points that are also relevant.

628
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:44,596
Scott: has to be a book that like, you know Well enough that you can find stuff.

629
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:45,821
Rym: Yeah, you know what I would use.

630
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:52,610
Rym: Honestly the darkness that came before Know that book well enough and it is eminently quotable.

631
00:36:52,971 --> 00:36:57,323
Rym: I mean, here's one a phrase you wouldn't want aliens to judge humanity by.

632
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,790
Rym: I could find that what pretty nothing you see.

633
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:03,080
Rym: I could find that words of nothing in like seconds.

634
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,143
Scott: What do you see?

635
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:05,627
Rym: a line written by dr.

636
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:06,490
Rym: Seuss might be harder.

637
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:08,719
Scott: What if you have that in the Hat in front of you?

638
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,969
Scott: you could just be like, yeah thing one and thing two.

639
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:15,742
Rym: This game was just like really good concept and the people seem to really have their stuff together.

640
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:16,745
Rym: So promising.

641
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:17,607
Rym: Mm-hmm.

642
00:37:18,129 --> 00:37:26,309
Rym: We played video video ball The sport that has replaced all other sport in a grim and dark future.

643
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,879
Scott: Hopefully it ice hockey finds an underground exist.

644
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,924
Rym: I'm telling you guys now you heard it here first Video ball is going to be a breakout game in the coming months.

645
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:38,570
Scott: video ball is gonna be the shit.

646
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,192
Scott: It's coming.

647
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:45,989
Rym: video ball is going to be an e-sport and I think it's going to begin in like the next few weeks Because it's gonna be the next knit hog.

648
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:51,228
Rym: If it's the next nig hut knit hog, that's fine because I'll play it with like the few people who remember it.

649
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:53,890
Scott: at worst It's the best knit hog is what I'm saying.

650
00:37:54,417 --> 00:38:04,597
Rym: I just think Pax should get the guy on the video ball staff who does the commentary like when they're at cons to be the commentator of every omegathon finale.

651
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:07,575
Rym: henceforth, I Mean this guy like.

652
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:10,788
Rym: I can't even do him justice, but I'm not even gonna try.

653
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:11,229
Rym: he's great.

654
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:20,970
Scott: So there's this game that we saw also in the expo hall there that made a big splash on the internet afterwards Even though some people were slow to discover it I guess because they weren't at PAX South.

655
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,396
Scott: Yeah, there's a game.

656
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:25,430
Scott: it had a nice booth right in the middle called star Mazer.

657
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:26,914
Scott: It's star.

658
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:28,423
Scott: Oh, I forgot all about that game.

659
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:29,750
Scott: It's a point-and-click adventure.

660
00:38:30,231 --> 00:38:42,906
Scott: It's also a shmup and it's got sort of like stylings of space quest but also anime But also sort of like I don't know really good stylings.

661
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:44,470
Scott: You'll know the stylings when you see them.

662
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:49,610
Rym: It's the kind of styling where you implicitly trust whatever creative team is making the game.

663
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,410
Scott: Yeah, it's like you just see the logo and you know what this game is all about style wise.

664
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,222
Scott: So it's like point-and-click adventure then some shmup action like combined.

665
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:09,390
Scott: It's like, oh, that's a really good combo That never existed with some really good style and since being kick-started I sort of see this game ending up being on the same level as like a shovel knight kind of deal.

666
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:10,594
Rym: Yeah, for sure.

667
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:14,570
Scott: Oh and in fact, it looks like there's some sort of crossover with shovel knight.

668
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:16,187
Scott: That was a stretch goal that was reached.

669
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:18,066
Scott: So there you go.

670
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:23,188
Scott: If you're into that keep an eye out for this because I think the Kickstarter is over.

671
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:23,550
Scott: It's over.

672
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,415
Rym: Sorry so much for that.

673
00:39:25,676 --> 00:39:31,433
Rym: Oh, well the other we played us some real money gambling real Money gambling.

674
00:39:31,473 --> 00:39:33,338
Rym: cordial minuet Jason roar.

675
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,304
Rym: I'm holding the card.

676
00:39:35,364 --> 00:39:37,450
Rym: He gave me when we were talking to him.

677
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:40,783
Rym: It's just a dollar bill with his website on it.

678
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:42,690
Scott: business cards often cost more than a dollar.

679
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:44,922
Rym: My blue cards are like 88 cents each.

680
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:45,927
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

681
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:49,339
Scott: So Basically real money gambling.

682
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,390
Scott: he made this game called cordial minuet.

683
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:54,802
Scott: It's themed as like an underground illuminati kind of deal.

684
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:58,554
Rym: his booth at PAX was like this gypsy Caravan like fly.

685
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:04,770
Scott: He bought like displays from tablets that had HDMI inputs from Southeast Asia.

686
00:40:04,951 --> 00:40:07,550
Rym: So the outside like imagine in Shadowrun.

687
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:13,290
Scott: You know, it looks like the gypsy tent from Zelda link to the past only spookier without the eyeball.

688
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:18,626
Rym: But some like magic runes on the front, but the inside is like a cyberpunk dystopian gambling den.

689
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:30,270
Rym: Yes, exactly I was about to say imagine in Shadowrun if you went to do an alley You saw the Zelda 3 hot and in there a bunch of deckers or gambling for real money.

690
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:32,563
Scott: So you can play this if you can get into it.

691
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,046
Scott: I'm into it.

692
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:33,690
Scott: I'm into it.

693
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:34,929
Scott: I was into it before PAX out.

694
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:42,481
Scott: I'm gonna play it a lot later after because when I launched it, it was like give real money and I was like I don't want to give real money gambling.

695
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:48,269
Scott: and then when I talked to Jason roar He was very convincing and he said you can play for a penny and I'm like, oh just one penny.

696
00:40:49,593 --> 00:40:50,235
Scott: This one penny.

697
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:52,320
Scott: and also I'm good at games.

698
00:40:52,461 --> 00:40:55,228
Scott: I have like I'm in like the top ten elo rankings.

699
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:57,735
Rym: Yeah I don't play high stakes.

700
00:40:57,775 --> 00:41:05,686
Scott: So like my profit like I don't even chart on like the profit rankings or the total money rankings I just win a lot way more than 50% of the time.

701
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:09,993
Rym: We'll talk about this game in much more detail later as well But it's kind of like.

702
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:18,486
Scott: basically I think there is a huge the near future Prediction right not betting on the prediction though, even though it's a prediction about betting.

703
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:18,907
Rym: I'm gonna.

704
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:19,590
Rym: I might bet on it.

705
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,314
Rym: I'm thinking I got.

706
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:27,290
Scott: people have discovered that gambling and Skill based games is legal in the United States of America.

707
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:32,567
Scott: There is a specific legal exception for fantasy sports and that is huge and somewhat.

708
00:41:32,627 --> 00:41:35,640
Scott: skill based Poker has already been on the rise though.

709
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,950
Scott: That is specifically illegal in many places.

710
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:50,070
Scott: But but specifically as poker right look at things such as you know Netrunner tournament pay to get in win prizes and also Jason roars real money gambling cordial minuets skill based game.

711
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:52,437
Scott: You know put real money out there.

712
00:41:52,457 --> 00:41:54,604
Scott: This is gonna be a big thing.

713
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:56,590
Scott: It's getting bigger all the time.

714
00:41:57,419 --> 00:41:58,290
Scott: Get ready for it.

715
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,223
Scott: it's like that's gonna be the next wave to replace the lost revenues.

716
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:14,030
Scott: now that people have figured out like the You know sort of Candy Crush money-making Candy box type games Real money gambling is gonna be the next thing on the mobile devices with the games to make money.

717
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:20,125
Scott: So if you want to make a lot of money I suggest making a skill based real money gambling now.

718
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:27,110
Rym: if you want to do this You need to be kind of like Jason roar like you need some like game theory like real game theory.

719
00:42:27,217 --> 00:42:32,933
Scott: No Cuz the way you make money in a real money gambling situation if it's a game of skill Right is.

720
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:39,757
Scott: you cannot be opposing the player because someone with a lot of skill We'll win and clean you the fuck out.

721
00:42:40,138 --> 00:42:42,705
Scott: You need other people to oppose each other.

722
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:45,594
Scott: put money down Battle each other.

723
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:51,630
Scott: winner takes the money loser loses the money, but you're the fucking house and you take a cut.

724
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:53,624
Scott: This is more than just how this works.

725
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:55,995
Rym: That is how Success look at.

Scott: I see like a middleman like grub hub can be beaten out But a you can't really replace like someone's.

744
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:53,870
Scott: you know Brokering real money gambling between two people you need that third party cannot be eliminated.

745
00:43:53,971 --> 00:43:57,430
Scott: You need someone there to sort of enforce their gamble.

746
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:03,830
Scott: Otherwise, like I'll just go into a. no you theoretically don't theoretically but so it's a random cryptocurrency.

Rym: Transactions.

748
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,262

749
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:09,089
Scott: I forced me to give you the money.

750
00:44:09,592 --> 00:44:11,721

00:44:14,893 --> 00:44:20,610
Scott: is there a completely technological escrow that does not require like someone to own a computer that enforces it or anything?

754
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,855
Rym: Yeah, Bitcoin already.

755
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:22,458
Scott: Does that work?

756
00:44:22,478 --> 00:44:23,080
Rym: What do you mean?

757
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:23,984
Rym: How does it escrow?

758
00:44:24,386 --> 00:44:25,390
Scott: So I give you a Bitcoin?

759
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:25,711
Scott: It's not.

760
00:44:25,772 --> 00:44:28,605
Rym: I'm saying that it is that there are ways to do it.

761
00:44:28,685 --> 00:44:29,770
Rym: I can't name a specific.

762
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:30,334
Scott: I don't think.

763
00:44:30,495 --> 00:44:31,098
Scott: I don't think it works.

764
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,890
Scott: like you have to give the Bitcoin to someone.

765
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:34,014
Rym: Yes It would be.

766
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:35,501
Scott: who do you give it to and we grow?

767
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:40,769
Rym: which is I'm saying it would be trivial To do the same kind of cryptographic technology.

768
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,050
Rym: I don't know.

769
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:56,067
Scott: Some computer has to be the escrow that it's holding on to the bitcoins while you are playing the game and then it has to Look at the state of the game Ensure the game was legit and give the winning monies to the correct winner.

770
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:59,637
Rym: the game It's never do that the game itself.

771
00:45:00,078 --> 00:45:04,028
Scott: who is running on which computer and who is ensuring your separate computers and the clients?

772
00:45:04,189 --> 00:45:08,210
Rym: the two-game clients interrogate each other cryptographically to ensure that they're both.

773
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:13,163
Rym: It is a hundred percent theoretically you make it that mr.

774
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:16,470
Scott: Genius, I think there has to be a third That is trusted.

775
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:19,055
Rym: Who's gonna make that?

776
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:20,101
Rym: some people we know.

777
00:45:20,121 --> 00:45:21,950
Rym: I can name two and I won't talk about on the show.

778
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:23,038
Rym: Yeah, they're gonna get together.

779
00:45:23,118 --> 00:45:23,763
Rym: They're gonna make it.

780
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:29,291
Rym: Okay the last big game we played was USCMC.

781
00:45:29,752 --> 00:45:36,129
Scott: so USCMC is really just torchbearer with alien Luke crane and Jared Sorenson basically made a mind of.

782
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:44,469
Rym: you know an official mod of Torchbearer that is the USCMC field operations manual, you know the movie aliens aliens.

783
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:47,399
Scott: Yes Specifically alien not alien aliens.

784
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:47,981
Rym: Yes.

785
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:54,840
Rym: I just go home and watch alien or Check it out independently targeting particle beam phallax.

786
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,362
Rym: Whap.

787
00:45:55,843 --> 00:45:58,130
Rym: Yeah that kid that game that movie.

788
00:45:59,115 --> 00:46:01,709
Rym: It is that movie the role-playing bug hunt.

789
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:03,476
Scott: Yes.

790
00:46:03,537 --> 00:46:04,223
Scott: Yes it is.

791
00:46:04,243 --> 00:46:13,549
Rym: So Torchbearer is a really like actually relatively simple system with a lot of skin and theme on top of it.

792
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:25,410
Rym: But the system is a very good way to broker like the role-playing situation of a team of people Attempting to achieve a goal by going into a place and then coming back out of that.

793
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:29,144
Scott: If you think about it aliens is very, you know dungeon II right?

794
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,870
Scott: It's like alright, we landed on this planet.

795
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,078
Scott: You're a team we go into this building.

796
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:33,440
Scott: It's just.

797
00:46:33,821 --> 00:46:35,367
Scott: it's basically just a dungeon crawl.

798
00:46:35,387 --> 00:46:36,190
Scott: that movie, right?

799
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,240
Scott: The mother alien is way down at the bottom.

800
00:46:38,582 --> 00:46:40,070
Scott: It's a hundred percent a dungeon crawl.

801
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,843
Scott: So you don't need a different game to tell that story.

802
00:46:43,883 --> 00:46:45,750
Rym: you have a team that's got a stated goal.

803
00:46:46,172 --> 00:46:52,281
Rym: You've got members of that team who have personal goals Yep, and then you've got a mystery and a twist.

804
00:46:52,401 --> 00:47:01,609
Scott: you have rooms to navigate treasures to acquire It's the only part you really take out is like the labor to bring the treasures out because it's not really physical treasures It's knowledge treasures you're looking for.

805
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:07,615
Rym: So our good friend Andrew put together an adventure for us and me and Scott crazy drunk Yeah, he did get he.

806
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:11,230
Rym: he drank a little too much of his milk in the course of running all the milk.

807
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:17,830
Rym: I point out that we Partially succeeded in our mission and only Scott and a bunch of civvies who deserved it died.

808
00:47:18,912 --> 00:47:25,310
Rym: Scott you fucking ah You fucked us the civilian we we Really?

809
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,459
Scott: I wasn't even supposed to be there in the first.

810
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:30,150
Scott: that's the reason that I was so willing to just like shoot them.

811
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,618
Scott: It's like we.

812
00:47:31,659 --> 00:47:40,330
Scott: basically he starts out and there's like, you know Some company Whelan company guy giving us like the briefing and our commanding officer Awesomely is like you're fucking coming with us into this, right?

813
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:42,449
Scott: So that was not part of the adventure to begin with.

814
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:44,990
Scott: Guy was not supposed to come with us to the space.

815
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,958
Rym: We made a test to make him come right.

816
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,342
Scott: so you shot him.

817
00:47:49,362 --> 00:47:56,670
Scott: Okay, so it I figured a. We are we are able to beat this mission beat, right?

818
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,970
Scott: We're able to complete this mission without this guy because the it was designed such that this he wasn't even supposed to come with us.

819
00:48:02,252 --> 00:48:04,009
Scott: That was like us thinking outside the box.

820
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:10,449
Scott: So killing him is not really end of the world and was actually went along well with my beliefs to try anti corporation, right?

821
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,424
Scott: To my odds of being successful there.

822
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:15,710
Scott: We're really really high.

823
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,056
Scott: I rolled really really badly.

824
00:48:17,136 --> 00:48:20,530
Rym: you failed to shoot that but there were two roles in a row.

825
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:30,690
Scott: I just exceed on one of them either the one to get him to do what I wanted and intimidate him Which is had a really high chance of success that I failed or the one to murder him Which had a really high chance of success but failed.

826
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:38,130
Rym: So, of course, he runs off and hides in the facility and eventually like rallies all the other scientists who are alive against us.

827
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:47,831
Rym: Yeah, because we're kind of the bad guys now sure and I think the the greatest moment in this game toward the end was Scott.

828
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:53,150
Rym: we were all in like the a the EVA room like the extra-vehicular activity, you know space station, right?

829
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:58,029
Rym: And we're all like we put on EVA suits just in case and Scott's like I'm not putting one on like.

830
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:59,520
Scott: yeah We're not going outside.

831
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:00,690
Scott: Someone else is going outside.

832
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,777
Scott: So why would I need to put one on?

833
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:06,790
Rym: all of us put these suits on except Scott you were going outside.

834
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,765
Rym: I wasn't who pointedly and repeatedly reminds everyone throughout this entire scene.

835
00:49:11,825 --> 00:49:13,289
Rym: Well, I just I don't have one on.

836
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:13,912
Scott: yeah I'm just like.

837
00:49:13,932 --> 00:49:16,003
Scott: yeah, I don't put one on because I'm not going outside.

838
00:49:16,124 --> 00:49:17,109
Scott: I'm not opening the door.

839
00:49:17,431 --> 00:49:18,896
Scott: There's no reason for me to put one on.

840
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:24,597
Scott: these other people aren't putting them on and I've gotta want to be flexible and mobile Not wearing a big heavy space.

841
00:49:24,637 --> 00:49:25,059
Scott: so we all.

842
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,789
Scott: I'm inside in a safe place Where I can shoot my gun or do whatever else I need to do.

843
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:35,070
Rym: So we all jump into space as you were going into space and I wasn't to get our ship back, right?

844
00:49:35,271 --> 00:49:35,836
Rym: The xenomorph?

845
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,369
Scott: I was waiting there for you to come back.

846
00:49:37,912 --> 00:49:40,342
Rym: Xenomorph comes up on Scott's ass, right?

847
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:41,246
Scott: So I try to shoot it.

848
00:49:41,447 --> 00:49:42,070
Scott: that didn't work.

849
00:49:42,532 --> 00:49:47,837
Scott: So then, you know, of course now You know my best-laid plans.

850
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:48,760
Scott: I'm not going outside.

851
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:55,120
Scott: Actually, the only way to get rid of this alien is to pull an alien one and open the door.

852
00:49:55,763 --> 00:50:04,379
Scott: Well, we all applauded Scott for this action But I did not have my suit on cuz I the last thing I thought I would be doing would be opening the door.

853
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:09,360
Scott: so I Sacrificed myself and open the door anyway to kill the alien.

854
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:10,103
Rym: So the both.

855
00:50:10,144 --> 00:50:14,767
Rym: the funniest thing was that Scott opens the door the alien I tried to hold on.

856
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:18,102
Rym: the alien makes its check and Holds on.

857
00:50:18,524 --> 00:50:20,290
Rym: Scott fails his hold on check.

858
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,096
Scott: So that's not supposed to be how it works.

859
00:50:22,136 --> 00:50:23,220
Scott: Didn't you see alien one?

860
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,651
Scott: So yeah, it's supposed to be the other way around.

861
00:50:25,671 --> 00:50:26,294
Scott: It's really just.

862
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,480
Scott: you can't blame me for doing.

863
00:50:27,904 --> 00:50:30,865
Scott: It's like if I failed those roles Which I did so from.

864
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:34,400
Scott: I can make fun of me cuz I'm stupid and it looks like I failed was bumbling.

865
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,871
Scott: But if I succeed in all those roles, I would be a genius and a hero.

866
00:50:38,111 --> 00:50:48,000
Rym: So from our perspective we hear Scott scream motherfucker But just space the room and then just he comes flying out of the door alone.

867
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,194
Rym: So I look like I committed suicide Andrew.

868
00:50:52,235 --> 00:50:53,220
Rym: Yeah Andrew turns to us.

869
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,628
Rym: He's like you're gonna save him.

870
00:50:54,648 --> 00:50:56,700
Rym: and I was like, oh shit Scott's got the data.

871
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:58,633
Rym: He's got the USB stick with that data we need.

872
00:50:58,995 --> 00:51:09,017
Rym: so I'm like, yeah I try to go save him and then as soon as I learn that Bringing his body back to the ship in time to save his life is a factor in the test.

873
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,919
Rym: I Asked Andrew with a straight face, so it'll be easier if I wait for him to be dead.

874
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:25,278
Rym: and Yeah, and Andrew says yes And that's what I do because my belief was only one of us needs to make it back alive.

875
00:51:25,399 --> 00:51:30,273
Scott: Sure Yeah, if I'd succeeded on those tests, I would be like hero genius and those.

876
00:51:30,293 --> 00:51:32,460
Scott: I had good odds except grabbing one.

877
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:32,942
Scott: That was bad.

878
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:34,209
Scott: I guess the other two I had good.

879
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,340
Rym: I applaud you for opening that door.

880
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:45,209
Rym: You may have saved humanity Maybe of course our chicken shit outfit just fucking ran and brought the heavy artillery Basically nuke the station from far space.

881
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:45,891
Scott: all hero, bro.

882
00:51:45,911 --> 00:51:46,874
Scott: You guys are the chicken shit.

883
00:51:47,256 --> 00:51:50,202
Rym: We just came back with nukes Chicken shit.

884
00:51:50,303 --> 00:51:57,404
Rym: Yeah, so even if you don't play torchbearer or tabled up RPGs go to this link and read this Document.

885
00:51:57,847 --> 00:52:00,460
Scott: this document is an RPG document reader.

886
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:04,997
Rym: Even if you're not this document is full like you'll understand a lot about.

887
00:52:05,037 --> 00:52:08,715
Rym: like you'll read this You'll be like, oh damn aliens and then you're just gonna want to play aliens.

888
00:52:10,283 --> 00:52:11,509
Scott: Uh, the RPG.

889
00:52:11,911 --> 00:52:13,339
Scott: This is pretty much it right now.

890
00:52:13,962 --> 00:52:19,406
Rym: What's funny though is uh, Scott and I had just kind of randomly Just watched predator.

891
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:23,180
Scott: the predator, which also kept saying this theme.

892
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,776
Scott: We kept saying go ahead me some go have me some fun.

893
00:52:25,796 --> 00:52:26,380
Scott: Have me some fun.

894
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,492
Rym: So the rest of the group watched aliens.

895
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:29,960
Rym: before this we watched predator.

896
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:34,980
Rym: So our group was a mix of the Marines from predator and the Marines from aliens.

897
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:36,339
Rym: It was beautiful.

898
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,568
Scott: Get to the chopper.

899
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:39,875
Scott: They've these shots all.

900
00:52:40,096 --> 00:52:40,700
Rym: get to the shot.

901
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:45,448
Rym: And that was basically our PAX South.

902
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:49,220
Scott: no the gaming part yeah, and that way you can remember from all those weeks ago.

903
00:52:49,582 --> 00:52:50,910
Rym: Yeah, I got notes.

904
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,440
Rym: We'll talk about San Antonio later.

905
00:52:58,565 --> 00:53:01,100
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
