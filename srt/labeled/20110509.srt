1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,770
Rym: It's Monday, May 9th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,012
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:12,857
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,506
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:17,639
Rym: Tonight we talk about, I forget, oh yeah, memory.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,360
Scott: Nothing.

7
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:24,309
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:28,750
Rym: You know, like my opening joke?

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,790
Scott: Have you ever had an opening joke that I liked in six years, five years?

10
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:33,969
Rym: Pretty much now.

11
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:34,532
Scott: Now.

12
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:37,750
Scott: So, what do you think of, I think about this one?

13
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:39,250
Rym: I can't remember.

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,969
Scott: Okay.

15
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:42,444
Rym: So, it's, you know, the end of spring.

16
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:43,390
Rym: It's the end of the season.

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,489
Rym: I can't believe I forgot until just now.

18
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,290
Rym: As in yesterday when I ordered groceries.

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,350
Rym: But, uh, it's fiddlehead season.

20
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:53,690
Rym: So I got some fiddleheads and I'm going to sautÃ© them in garlic and butter.

21
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:55,189
Rym: In like an hour.

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,870
Scott: Why don't you just eat the garlic and the butter?

23
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,370
Rym: Well, the garlic and the butter you see are not food, but are merely things to put on food.

24
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:04,316
Scott: I disagree.

25
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:07,990
Scott: Butter dip butter is the most excellent of foods.

26
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,587
Rym: Butter dip butter is more of an hors d'oeuvre.

27
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,162
Scott: Is an hors d'oeuvre not food?

28
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:14,330
Scott: Food is the superset.

29
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,410
Rym: If I eat it, does it not bleed deliciously into my mouth?

30
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:18,209
Scott: It does.

31
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,790
Rym: If I tickle it, well, I guess it doesn't laugh.

32
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:27,590
Scott: It'll get your hands kind of greasy, and then you could use those greasy hands to make someone else laugh.

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,370
Rym: Oh, there's something about, because I've been biking to work every day, right?

34
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,053
Rym: And it used to be.

35
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:34,230
Rym: I'd subway to work, subway home, run, and then do stuff.

36
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,250
Rym: But biking three times a day is kind of making me hungry all the time.

37
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:44,630
Rym: Which makes me think about food all the time, which makes me cook more often, because when I'm hungry I cook rather than eat out.

38
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,229
Rym: As a result, I've been cooking a lot.

39
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:48,840
Rym: I think I've mastered frittata.

40
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,569
Rym: I've got to move on to full-on quiche now.

41
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:51,685
Scott: Blech.

42
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:53,261
Rym: What's wrong with you?

43
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:53,809
Rym: Do you like eggs?

44
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:54,525
Scott: Yeah.

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,469
Rym: Do you like nutmeg?

46
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:56,850
Rym: Yeah, it's alright.

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,304
Rym: Onions?

48
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:57,799
Rym: Yep.

49
00:01:58,332 --> 00:01:58,669
Rym: Potatoes?

50
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,850
Scott: Yeah, potato's good.

51
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:00,369
Rym: Tomatoes?

52
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:00,842
Rym: Yep.

53
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,049
Rym: Well, that's a quiche.

54
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,210
Scott: No, quiche is disgusting.

55
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:03,716
Rym: Why?

56
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,070
Scott: Because in their combination, a great evil is unfurled.

57
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:09,410
Rym: It's just egg pie.

58
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:10,467
Scott: That's disgusting.

59
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,609
Rym: You eat egg custard.

60
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:12,990
Scott: Egg custard is different.

61
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:13,665
Scott: How so?

62
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,950
Scott: That's egg cake.

63
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,670
Rym: I would argue an egg custard is a pie.

64
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:22,810
Rym: In the same way that a cheesecake is in fact a pie.

65
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,109
Scott: Cheesecake is a cake.

66
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,690
Rym: It's not made out of bread.

67
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:27,810
Scott: It has graham cracker crust.

68
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,747
Rym: So does quiche.

69
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,189
Rym: Sometimes.

70
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:33,303
Rym: Uh-huh.

71
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,209
Rym: It's a pie crust.

72
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:36,084
Rym: Anyway.

73
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:37,570
Scott: Anyway.

74
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:38,510
Rym: It's Monday.

75
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,169
Rym: It's tech day.

76
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:43,090
Rym: I had a lot I wanted to talk about, so I guess I had to narrow this down.

77
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:47,350
Rym: I'm gonna complain about a guy who wrote something stupid on the internet.

78
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,119
Rym: So there's this guy on...

79
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:50,967
Scott: Uh, here we go.

80
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:51,784
Rym: InfoWorld.

81
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:53,790
Rym: This article was on Slashdot.

82
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,950
Rym: It's actually making the rounds.

83
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,430
Rym: A lot of people were talking about it.

84
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,508
Scott: Slashdot, it made the rounds a week ago.

85
00:02:59,017 --> 00:02:59,103
Rym: Yeah.

86
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:02,290
Rym: Thing is, I don't go to Slashdot to get stuff first.

87
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,310
Rym: I go to Slashdot to get witty commentary.

88
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,830
Rym: Or more importantly, Slashdot means I don't have to do research.

89
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,790
Scott: I don't read the comments on any site.

90
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,047
Scott: Ever.

91
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,589
Rym: I pretty much only go to Fark and Slashdot, and you know what I do?

92
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:16,450
Rym: I primarily read the comments and not the articles.

93
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,970
Scott: Between us, you've read the whole internet.

94
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,649
Rym: Pretty much.

95
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,430
Rym: But basically, this is one of those guys who writes generic, techy articles that then nerds complain about, totally missing the point usually.

96
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:35,569
Rym: He's the kind of guy that... Well, I've learned a lot about these guys, because way back when I worked at the hospital, and I was bored and thinking about quitting.

97
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:41,749
Scott: The thing is, I've realized this problem in gaming and technology, and I'm sure it also exists in other areas, right?

98
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,830
Scott: But consider this.

99
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,567
Scott: If I read a restaurant review, right?

100
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,384
Scott: That sounds pretty good to me, but I bet, I bet there are chefs out there who are like, "That restaurant critic doesn't know

101
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:50,627
Scott: shit.".

102
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,228
Scott: Because if he knew shit, you know what he would be?

103
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:52,788
Scott: A cook.

104
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:53,989
Rym: Not necessarily.

105
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,950
Rym: Perhaps he simply loves to eat cupcakes, but not to bake cupcakes.

106
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,846
Scott: He can bake and eat the cupcakes together.

107
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,030
Rym: But see, I think here's the problem.

108
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:10,390
Rym: People who love food enough to review food, who also learn to be professional chefs, die of obesity immediately.

109
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,230
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

110
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,170
Scott: There's a feedback loop.

111
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,890
Rym: So thus, the people who are smart enough to not learn to cook are the only people who can survive being food critics.

112
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:25,210
Scott: Right, but things that I know about, like technology and gaming, I see these journalists writing about gaming or technology.

113
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,210
Scott: And I bet to normal people, they sound like they really know what they're talking about.

114
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:39,550
Scott: But the fact is, as someone who actually does technology and knows games, I guess I don't technically do games, but I know a lot more about games than a lot of game journalists.

115
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,228
Rym: Well, according to a lot of developers we've talked to, we think about games way more than they do.

116
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,850
Scott: The journalists don't know anything.

117
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:54,510
Scott: So this is probably some tech guy who, you know, if he knew more about technology, he would be a technologist and not a technology journalist.

118
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,967
Rym: Maybe he is.

119
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,570
Rym: What about people like John C. Dvorak?

120
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,082
Rym: He knows a lot.

121
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,249
Scott: He doesn't know nearly.

122
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,886
Scott: No, he doesn't.

123
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,989
Rym: Let me put it this way.

124
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,022
Scott: He knows more about technology companies than actual computers.

125
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,330
Rym: John C. Dvorak has a great breadth of knowledge in the techno industry at large.

126
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,029
Rym: It's very shallow.

127
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,150
Rym: It is very shallow, but it is very breadthful and I can't disrespect him for that.

128
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:23,310
Scott: But the thing is, most of those guys, he doesn't know about, you know, I mean, he knows enough about computers that he can use them and set them up and do all sorts of normal people things.

129
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,250
Rym: He also knows effectively how to troll.

130
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,330
Scott: But I mean, and he knows a lot about, you know, the tech companies.

131
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:38,410
Scott: And if he was writing an article about computers, it would go in the business section of the newspaper, not in the, you know, technology section of the newspaper.

132
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,450
Rym: But he has more knowledge of tech than the vast majority of tech journalists.

133
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:42,709
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

134
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:47,208
Scott: But I mean, he's not going to be writing anything for like the ACM Journal or the IEEE, you.

135
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,810
Rym: But I have for you a counterexample and then an anecdote.

136
00:05:51,392 --> 00:06:01,930
Rym: Because the counterexample is that in the financial sector, I read articles on financial stuff and those people know way more than me or most other people in the field about the field.

137
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,706
Scott: They know a lot.

138
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,150
Scott: Then how come they're doing that instead of making mad money?

139
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,970
Rym: They're making pretty good money because usually the people who are writing the things that I'm reading are also published academics.

140
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:20,430
Rym: Anyway, the anecdotal evidence I have is that when I was sick of working at the hospital and I thought about giving up on IT completely, that was when I went to take the LSAT.

141
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,729
Rym: I was like, I'll be a lawyer.

142
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,929
Rym: And all the lawyer friends were like, God, no, you'll hate it.

143
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,209
Rym: And then I was like, OK, I'll be a journalist.

144
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,790
Rym: And I actually applied to a bunch of tech journalism jobs.

145
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:35,209
Rym: And I ghostwrote for a bunch of tech journals and websites because that's how you interview for places like that.

146
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,490
Rym: You ghostwrite articles for them that they publish so they don't have to do work.

147
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,710
Rym: They get free work, basically.

148
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:46,449
Rym: So I got my assignments and I wrote and basically the assignments were pathetic.

149
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:50,330
Rym: They were along the lines of X is popular.

150
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:57,409
Scott: Write an article about how Y influences X so that we can get increase the search engine traffic as most people are searching for X.

151
00:06:57,855 --> 00:06:58,048
Rym: Yep.

152
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:58,506
Scott: Yep.

153
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:02,670
Rym: And basically the vast majority of tech journalism seems to be that.

154
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,048
Rym: And I after interviewing these people.

155
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:06,387
Rym: Yeah, I gave up.

156
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:06,809
Rym: Yeah.

157
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,789
Rym: Well, I don't think Wired magazine exactly has the hard hitting tech writers either.

158
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:12,670
Scott: It has a few, but not many.

159
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:24,229
Rym: So anyway, this dude, Galen Gruman, wrote this thing where he basically says that wireless network infrastructure is being neglected and it needs to be the core.

160
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:31,165
Rym: It needs to be as well managed, as important, as central to enterprise as the wired network needs to be.

161
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:33,290
Scott: And in what way does he mean that?

162
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,710
Scott: Does he mean like the backbone of the Internet should be wireless?

163
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,241
Rym: No, no, no.

164
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,190
Rym: So he has all these statistics, which I am highly half of them.

165
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,590
Rym: I'm dubious.

166
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,350
Rym: I just don't think they're accurate.

167
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:43,823
Rym: Okay.

168
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:55,950
Scott: And the other half, even if they're accurate, he is begging the question and drawing the absolute wrong conclusion, because I do think that a lot of enterprise people either a, they don't have wireless at all for security reasons.

169
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,187
Rym: They don't need it.

170
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,950
Scott: Well, I think that there are some significant benefits to having it.

171
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:10,630
Scott: Even if you don't need it, it could be significantly beneficial and it is possible to make it secure enough as long as you don't use it, you know, for as long as you fence it off from certain applications.

172
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:10,820
Scott: Right.

173
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:17,890
Scott: It's like if people can get their exchange, their emails on their phones with Wi-Fi walking around the office.

174
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,830
Rym: Ah, but so here's that's worse.

175
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,200
Rym: Yes.

176
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:31,009
Rym: One of the examples he uses is the rapid growth of smartphones and how many people have smartphones that have Wi-Fi capabilities and how if they could use those on the wireless network, things would be so much better.

177
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:43,289
Rym: Yet the vast majority of what anyone does with a smartphone in any professional context is read email, get pages, respond to email and pages.

178
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:43,890
Scott: Yep.

179
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:45,627
Rym: You can do that over your three G's.

180
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:57,290
Scott: Ah, but actually if I was enterprise and I'm worried about security, I would rather have if those things going over the Wi-Fi in my company on my company's network, then going over the three G of AT&T or something like that.

181
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:03,850
Rym: But the Wi-Fi, so having the secure Wi-Fi would be pointless because the only reason to have one of those devices is because you're leaving the office.

182
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:05,249
Rym: You're going somewhere else.

183
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:09,010
Scott: Yes, but at least more of the traffic that has the email.

184
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,730
Rym: Nope, because no one uses their goddamn Blackberry when they're in the office.

185
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,430
Scott: Yeah, they do.

186
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,990
Rym: Whoo, their computer's there.

187
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,630
Scott: You go look at any office that just people walking around the offices with Blackberries.

188
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,190
Rym: You know what?

189
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:26,830
Scott: I don't know what offices you've been to, but that's all I see when people are walking and anyone who gets up to walk around in the bathroom, phones are in their hands are looking at it.

190
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,549
Rym: See, I've seen that.

191
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,950
Rym: You know what?

192
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,810
Scott: In conference rooms, Blackberries all over the table.

193
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:39,708
Rym: The only people who are ever checking their email on their Blackberries in the offices were the mid-level executives, and most of the people I see walking around with a phone have a web page up.

194
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:42,090
Scott: I see everybody from top to bottom doing that.

195
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:42,969
Rym: I don't see that.

196
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:49,370
Rym: Of course, I've always worked in big enterprise where it's a very different environment, but nonetheless, I don't think there's any benefit to people.

197
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,650
Rym: Plus, most Blackberries don't handle connecting to WANs gracefully.

198
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,090
Scott: Well, who's using a Blackberry?

199
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,210
Scott: Most enterprise users.

200
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,430
Scott: I know, that's your other problem.

201
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,789
Scott: Trash your Blackberry server.

202
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:02,610
Scott: Use Exchange and get Windows or Android or iPhones.

203
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:03,690
Rym: Now, we've talked about this.

204
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,590
Rym: The plausible deniability of using Blackberry basically protects you from all possible litigation in the event of a problem.

205
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,990
Scott: What's not plausibly deniable about an Exchange server?

206
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,290
Rym: Hardly anyone uses that on phones for enterprise.

207
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:16,149
Scott: It will change.

208
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:16,686
Scott: It works.

209
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,590
Rym: It will change.

210
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,410
Rym: Yeah, it works, but it's safer from a business perspective.

211
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,130
Scott: These people already have Exchange servers.

212
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,489
Scott: They just have to turn ActiveSync on.

213
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:24,746
Scott: Done.

214
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,270
Scott: One click.

215
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,870
Rym: Plus, most of the people who care about this, who actually want to receive their work email, they're Blackberry types anyway.

216
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,770
Rym: A lot of them don't have their own smartphone.

217
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,029
Rym: A lot of them are happy to have gotten the work smartphone.

218
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,570
Rym: Otherwise, he points out that the use of wireless printers is on the rise.

219
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:44,210
Rym: E-book readers.

220
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:48,250
Rym: He says 38% of these people in businesses have e-book readers.

221
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,549
Scott: You don't need an e-book reader at work.

222
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:49,834
Scott: No.

223
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,309
Scott: What possible thing at work could you need?

224
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,870
Scott: Why would you need the e-book reader to be on the work network?

225
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:56,590
Rym: Here's a good example.

226
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,810
Rym: Barcode scanners for inventory control.

227
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,270
Rym: You know what?

228
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,810
Rym: Yeah.

229
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,510
Rym: That's a great wireless application.

230
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,107
Rym: And you know what?

231
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,910
Rym: It requires effectively zero bandwidth.

232
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,289
Scott: Yeah, almost none.

233
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,266
Scott: You drop a couple access points strategically in the warehouse so that you get coverage, and that's it.

234
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,290
Scott: Now, you could make a point- And you have those on a separate network where the barcode app is the only application accessible.

235
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,290
Rym: His article is pretty stupid, and I disagree with almost everything he says.

236
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:29,110
Rym: But there is a point to be made that one, wireless networks are almost always shitily managed or nonexistent in any company.

237
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:30,930
Rym: My company happens to do it right.

238
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:41,525
Rym: We have a wireless network with proper authentication, and strangers in our office who are visiting, we can give them a code, they can connect, and they only get access to the internet and things we gave them access to.

239
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,570
Rym: Completely sequestered from the real corporate network, let alone the production networks.

240
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,947
Rym: Separately, say you're in a business where you need wireless on some sort of production network.

241
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,030
Rym: You have two wirelesses on two different frequencies.

242
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:01,030
Scott: Even my house has four wirelesses on two different frequencies.

243
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,750
Scott: My house, which only has one person living in it, with a router I bought on Amazon.

244
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:13,530
Rym: One of the points the guy makes is that you need to centrally manage your wireless with the same level of efficiency and proficiency that you manage your wired network.

245
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,288
Rym: No shit.

246
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:14,815
Rym: Duh.

247
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,530
Rym: Manage all your IT professionally.

248
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,088
Scott: Yeah, I think what he's saying, though, is there are a lot of places that just don't have wireless at all.

249
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:33,290
Rym: Which is fine, because I would argue that in most business situations, most offices, it is cheaper, safer, faster, and more reliable to use wired for everything.

250
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,910
Rym: Because almost any office space you go into will have a centralized network infrastructure already in the building.

251
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,790
Scott: You gotta have a wireless, though.

252
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,929
Scott: At the very least, you've got people coming into the office who are clients or outsiders and they wanna get some internets.

253
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,769
Rym: Yup, and you know what?

254
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,988
Rym: It's trivial to set up a DMZ wireless internet.

255
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,883
Scott: I think there are places that have no wireless.

256
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,670
Rym: But that doesn't seem to be what this guy's arguing.

257
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,630
Rym: He's arguing that your actual real corporate network, the one your real shit is on, should be mostly wireless.

258
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:01,229
Scott: That's retarded.

259
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,970
Rym: I mean, wireless printer?

260
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:03,890
Rym: What the hell?

261
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,590
Rym: You can't afford to run a cable?

262
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,490
Scott: I guess if you had some kind of weird ass office and you couldn't wire it for some reason.

263
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,830
Rym: I could see this being the case if you had places where people are highly mobile.

264
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,710
Rym: A stupid office where people just use laptops and wander around all over the place.

265
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:31,530
Scott: But the thing is, even if you have, let's say you have that, let's say you have an office that's a big open space, there's no walls or whatever, and everyone has MacBook Airs that don't have network cards, and everyone just has wireless everything and you roam around the office.

266
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,048
Scott: You know what?

267
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:42,830
Scott: You'll still need to run a wire to the access point from the internets, which is probably in the corner of the office on a rack or something, where your firewalls and your servers are.

268
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,910
Scott: They have to be wired.

269
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,570
Scott: You gotta run the wires anyway to the access points.

270
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,307
Scott: You might as well stick a switch there instead of the access point, and suddenly you've gotta block it to cubes.

271
00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:04,429
Rym: Actually, your example is pretty terrible because, yeah, that wire is a given, but if it's a big open space with nowhere to run wires, then yeah, wireless is a lot cheaper and easier than running wires.

272
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:05,594
Rym: Eh.

273
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,690
Rym: All over the office as opposed to a two foot wire from the router to the access point.

274
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,704
Scott: No, but I mean, it depends how big the office is.

275
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:13,450
Scott: first of all, right?

276
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,590
Scott: And second of all, wires are really cheap.

277
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:24,310
Scott: You can get a whole bundle of them for nothing and you can get little switches for really nothing, but good access points can be very expensive if you need a lot of them.

278
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,070
Scott: Like if you need five or six of them, that could be like a thousand dollars.

279
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:39,830
Rym: The other thing is, I think a lot of newer companies that are starting up or people who are making new office spaces have this idea, and this article is playing to that, that going all wireless or going mostly wireless is a good idea.

280
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,190
Rym: And it introduces to me security problems.

281
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,690
Rym: Wireless technology is not great.

282
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,230
Rym: It introduces expenses.

283
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,530
Scott: Everyone's using wireless.

284
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:53,030
Scott: It's like, you know, when you go to a conference and too many people use wireless and it doesn't work, imagine that every day if you have a lot of people in the office.

285
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:53,966
Rym: Yep.

286
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,129
Scott: That would be the worst thing ever.

287
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:57,530
Rym: And I mean, that's it.

288
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,390
Rym: I could go into more and more about why I think this article is pretty dumb.

289
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,350
Rym: Like he goes on like 75% of users have tablets and tons of people have laptops.

290
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,789
Scott: But you're not supposed to use those at work.

291
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,510
Rym: What are you going to use a tablet for at work?

292
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:10,150
Rym: Unless you're walking around.

293
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,650
Scott: Unless you're a developer who's developing a tablet application, in which case there's going to be like a Wi-Fi there for you.

294
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:23,967
Rym: Or, one big use of tablets that is really important is anyone who has to be mobile and capture data from things.

295
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,350
Rym: Like walking around, checking on business processes, or doing inventory control.

296
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,170
Rym: A wireless barcode scanner and a tablet you can hold is a million times more efficient than any sort of other device.

297
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:50,490
Scott: The thing is, even with systems like that, you know, like I said, cover the warehouse and wireless, or you could even just as efficiently set up some sort of system where you go around collecting data on the tablet and then when you're done you just put the tablet in a dock and then it gets wired and then all the data comes out.

298
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,310
Scott: And that's just almost as efficient.

299
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:01,668
Rym: I guess my problem with fluff articles like this is that he makes a bold assertion that isn't really backed up and the data is kind of specious and shitty and independently.

300
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:04,930
Rym: the other point he makes that is legitimate is a useless point.

301
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,750
Rym: He's basically saying wireless should be administered properly.

302
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,850
Scott: Yeah, everything should be administered properly.

303
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,469
Rym: So that's the end of my crotchety tech news.

304
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,348
Scott: Anyway, you know they always have those poon to own things?

305
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,119
Scott: Oh yeah!

306
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,649
Scott: Where it's like, you know, if you can hack this laptop then you get it.

307
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,729
Scott: And stuff like that.

308
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,649
Rym: I detect a pronunciational shift from pun slowly to poon.

309
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:29,390
Scott: Anyway.

310
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,348
Rym: And eventually to pwn.

311
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,330
Scott: I think that's how they pronounce the contest.

312
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,090
Scott: But the point is, that contest happened a while ago and it won't be happening again for quite a while.

313
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:41,710
Rym: You know what, if you can beat me in Advanced Wars, I'll give you my copy of Advanced Wars.

314
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,687
Scott: No, you have to give me the DS.

315
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,730
Scott: That's how it would work.

316
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:44,324
Scott: Fine.

317
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,086
Scott: Yeah.

318
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,590
Scott: But if I lose, I don't have to give you anything.

319
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:52,010
Scott: Well, Chrome always wins those things.

320
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,749
Scott: Basically, no one ever cracks the Chrome.

321
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:00,109
Scott: But, just now, Vupen Security, V-U-P-E-N, has pwned.

322
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:00,882
Scott: Pwned.

323
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:01,829
Scott: Pooninated.

324
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:03,209
Rym: I do prefer pwned.

325
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,723
Rym: I like the idea that- Owned-ed.

326
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:10,690
Rym: I know I'm the minority opinion, but before there was voice on the internet, there was a dichotomy.

327
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,969
Rym: And people in some areas said pwn.

328
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:13,608
Rym: Some said poon, some said pwn.

329
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,410
Rym: Pwn and own works because it fits the word.

330
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,767
Rym: You were owned, you were pwned.

331
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:20,549
Rym: But the origin was a typo.

332
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,548
Rym: Pwned is the way you would actually pronounce it as reading.

333
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,410
Scott: Anyway, so these people, they have discovered a security problem in Google Chrome.

334
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,047
Scott: They got it.

335
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:32,810
Scott: No one else has ever, I don't think, gotten one.

336
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,070
Scott: At least not in recent memory.

337
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,789
Rym: They got got.

338
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,870
Scott: They got one, and it's of the biggest kind.

339
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:42,370
Scott: It bypasses all security features, even the sandbox, and it's silent, so there's no crash.

340
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:45,450
Scott: And it's an undisclosed zero-day vulnerability.

341
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,667
Scott: It works on all Windows systems and Chrome version 1169, whatever.

342
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:56,129
Scott: Basically, they have a video here that shows them doing it.

343
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,230
Scott: And they can, through Google Chrome, run arbitrary binary instructions on your computer.

344
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:02,863
Scott: Period.

345
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:04,750
Rym: Glad I don't use Chrome.

346
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,490
Scott: Well, I'm just saying, what's interesting about this story is not that somebody owned Chrome, even though that's kind of rare.

347
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:16,770
Scott: It's that usually when someone discovers a vulnerability, they announce it in sort of different ways.

348
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,910
Scott: There's the one where they just announce it to the world, and it's like, aha, you got to fix it now before everyone starts hacking you.

349
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,330
Scott: Sometimes they're like, they whisper it to the company in question so that they can fix it and release a patch.

350
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,589
Scott: And then when the patch comes out, then they announce it on the same day as the patch comes out.

351
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:37,450
Scott: Sometimes they whisper it to the company, but then they're like, company, you got 30 days to fix it or else we're going to announce it, right?

352
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:47,030
Scott: In this case, the rumor seems to be that this Vupen Security is trying to do a blackmail situation.

353
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:47,470
Scott: What?

354
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,590
Scott: They're like, Google, pay us a bunch of money or else we'll tell.

355
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,150
Scott: And Google already, I mean, I know Mozilla has bounties.

356
00:18:54,491 --> 00:19:04,290
Scott: I'm pretty sure Google also has some sort of bounties for finding, you know, for doing certain, finding certain vulnerabilities or solving bugs or features of some kind.

357
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,670
Rym: There's a very fundamental moral, or I guess this is actually straight up ethics.

358
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,900
Scott: Straight up legal, right?

359
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,110
Scott: I mean, they're blackmailing something.

360
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:11,901
Rym: Well, independently.

361
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:12,350
Scott: Is it ethical?

362
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,270
Scott: Or at least extorting.

363
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:20,310
Rym: Is it ethical to ask for a finder's fee for finding an undisclosed, unknown vulnerability in someone's software?

364
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,836
Scott: Well, you're wording it differently.

365
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,987
Scott: Is it extorting or is it blackmailing or is it finder's fee?

366
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:25,730
Scott: It's the same thing.

367
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:26,611
Rym: Well, is it though?

368
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:27,433
Rym: Here's my question.

369
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:35,910
Rym: Is it a crime or should it be a crime to disclose truth that you acquired through legal means?

370
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,201
Scott: Well, I mean, if they just disclose it, you know, I mean, people have done that.

371
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,205
Scott: I don't really have a problem with that.

372
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:41,289
Scott: It's the extorting of money.

373
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,617
Rym: This is why it's an interesting argument.

374
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:50,050
Rym: So it is OK to disclose a vulnerability that I find through legal means like it is ethically.

375
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:52,304
Rym: You can't fault someone for telling the truth.

376
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:52,908
Rym: Is that correct?

377
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:53,190
Scott: Right.

378
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:00,130
Rym: So is it ethical to tell someone else who could fix it and who is affected by it that it exists?

379
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,567
Scott: This vulnerability, you could you could tell anyone whatever you want.

380
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,070
Rym: All right.

381
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:07,739
Rym: Is it ethical to say to them, here's the bug.

382
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:11,230
Rym: If you don't give me money, I will tell other people.

383
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:14,138
Scott: No, that's that's a line there.

384
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,302
Rym: But how so?

385
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,590
Rym: I'm I'm basically threatening telling the truth.

386
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,894
Scott: You're threatening somebody.

387
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:21,623
Scott: But it's not that telling the truth is always OK.

388
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:22,847
Scott: It's threatening someone.

389
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:23,509
Scott: that's not OK.

390
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,875
Rym: So what if I don't actually threaten?

391
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:28,362
Rym: What if I simply say I found this vulnerability.

392
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:31,390
Rym: I plan to tell the public in a week.

393
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:32,616
Scott: You can do that.

394
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:34,147
Rym: Dot, dot, dot.

395
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,372
Rym: Hmm.

396
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:39,924
Rym: Unless, you know, someone gave me something.

397
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:40,666
Scott: Well, there you go.

398
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:41,710
Scott: You crossed the line again, didn't you?

399
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,473
Rym: So that's the line?

400
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:43,196
Scott: Yeah, I think so.

401
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:43,779
Rym: So I can't.

402
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:45,627
Rym: What if I ask for a finder's fee?

403
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:46,270
Rym: I don't even blackmail.

404
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,939
Rym: I just say, would you be willing to pay me for the fact that I found this?

405
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,950
Scott: Well, I think there might already be a bounty or something.

406
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,834
Rym: Without threatening.

407
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:55,045
Rym: Just saying, will you pay me for the fact that I found this?

408
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:55,789
Scott: You can ask.

409
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:56,070
Scott: Sure.

410
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:00,650
Rym: And then if they don't respond or say no, if you just happen to release to the public.

411
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:02,515
Rym: The thing you found.

412
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:03,800
Scott: I mean, you're not threatening them.

413
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,969
Rym: Ah, so implied threats are OK.

414
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,250
Scott: It's not an implied threat if you're either threatening them or you're not.

415
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,750
Rym: So as long as I don't actually directly threaten them, it's OK to blackmail the ever living fuck out of them.

416
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,720
Scott: You're not blackmailing them if you're not threatening them.

417
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:18,750
Scott: Threat is part of blackmail.

418
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,480
Rym: I sent someone the naked pictures I got of them and I'm like, hey, I found these pictures.

419
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:25,310
Rym: I'm thinking about just publishing them, you know.

420
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:28,234
Scott: All right.

421
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,569
Rym: Would you be willing to pay me for the pictures?

422
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:33,495
Scott: I don't know.

423
00:21:33,595 --> 00:21:34,823
Rym: At what point did I make a threat?

424
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:35,669
Scott: I don't know.

425
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,374
Scott: The point is, I don't.

426
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:41,670
Scott: I think there is a definite line where if you threaten someone, that is no good now.

427
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,293
Rym: I mean, my ethics are pretty simple.

428
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:51,913
Rym: My personal ethical analysis is that if I find a severe vulnerability in software that is publicly available, I would inform the company.

429
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:57,850
Rym: But if they did not respond or take me seriously or agree to fix it in a reasonable span, I would announce it publicly.

430
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:58,992
Scott: That's a good idea.

431
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:01,641
Scott: I really, you know, I don't even know what I do.

432
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:04,149
Scott: I might just be like, you know, I don't really go for it.

433
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,354
Scott: Yeah, I don't really care enough.

434
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:13,230
Scott: I guess if it was, you know, I mean, if it was like a Mozilla situation where I know they have bounties, I would just be like, hey, you have a bounty I'd like to collect.

435
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:13,772
Scott: Here you go.

436
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:17,550
Rym: I know tons of vulnerabilities in enterprise software because it's all shittily written.

437
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:20,689
Scott: You should go and blackmail them.

438
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,876
Scott: Yeah, I should.

439
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:24,460
Rym: What am I going to blackmail them with?

440
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:27,950
Rym: I call up, you know, one of the huge, I'm not going to name any names because.

441
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,830
Rym: Huge company.

442
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:35,010
Rym: I call up one of these huge companies and be like, if you don't pay me, I'm going to tell the world that your software sucks balls.

443
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:35,882
Scott: OK.

444
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:37,776
Rym: But it sucks.

445
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:38,723
Rym: Don't you care?

446
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:39,690
Rym: Because no one cares.

447
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,250
Scott: No one cares.

448
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,244
Rym: So things of the day.

449
00:22:49,264 --> 00:22:50,049
Rym: What do you got for me?

450
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:54,130
Rym: You forgot, didn't you?

451
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:54,666
Scott: No, I didn't.

452
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:58,190
Scott: OK, so, you know, Star Trek, right?

453
00:22:58,996 --> 00:22:59,409
Rym: Which one?

454
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,308
Scott: That thing I don't like.

455
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:02,009
Rym: So any particular Star Trek?

456
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:04,589
Scott: Star Trek, I guarantee you've never seen or heard of.

457
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,415
Rym: All right.

458
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,150
Scott: I know weird that I would know a Star Trek that you've never seen.

459
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,948
Rym: Well, let's see.

460
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:11,448
Rym: So, I mean, not many.

461
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:15,490
Rym: See, I could make a dirty joke and be like, oh, you mean Voyager.

462
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,089
Scott: But anyway, in the year nineteen hundred and seventy one.

463
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:21,269
Scott: Right.

464
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,690
Rym: Star Trek Christmas special.

465
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,078
Scott: No.

466
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:24,949
Rym: Star Trek cartoon.

467
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:25,350
Scott: No.

468
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:33,370
Scott: This twenty one year old dude who is in college at Ohio State University was in a class, a TV production.

469
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:36,170
Rym: Oh, I saw this on the Internet.

470
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:36,830
Scott: Yeah.

471
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:37,306
Scott: Yeah.

472
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:44,690
Scott: And as his final exam, he made a five minute episode of Star Trek on a one inch open real videotape.

473
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,470
Scott: He transferred it to U-matic.

474
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,688
Scott: I don't even know what the hell that is.

475
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,950
Scott: He transferred it to Beta.

476
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,705
Scott: I know what that is.

477
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,730
Scott: And he got an A minus on his project.

478
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,446
Rym: A minus.

479
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,450
Scott: And now he has transferred it to YouTube.

480
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:58,190
Rym: As well he should.

481
00:23:58,552 --> 00:23:59,548
Scott: And you can now watch it.

482
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:01,108
Rym: My head is off to you.

483
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:01,808
Rym: Good sir.

484
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,369
Scott: I don't even like Star Trek, but it's like, this is so hellish.

485
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:06,329
Scott: How can you not make a thing of the day?

486
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,790
Rym: You know, I think you would actually like later next generation.

487
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,025
Scott: Whatever.

488
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,209
Rym: I think you would.

489
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:14,269
Scott: I'm watching better shows.

490
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:15,330
Rym: What though?

491
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,050
Rym: I mean, what problem do you have?

492
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,555
Rym: Isn't the sci-fi you like?

493
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:22,010
Rym: hard sci-fi with serious ethical and scientific questions?

494
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,030
Rym: And ambiguous answers?

495
00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:24,710
Scott: You know what?

496
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:29,630
Scott: I don't like two spaceships sitting perfectly still, shooting lasers at each other, not even trying to dodge or anything.

497
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:32,769
Rym: That's actually probably how real space combat would be.

498
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:33,785
Scott: No.

499
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,030
Scott: I'm pretty sure it would be more like X-Wing and TIE Fighter.

500
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:37,940
Rym: No.

501
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,497
Scott: Yeah.

502
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:39,709
Rym: Probably not.

503
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:41,530
Scott: Or Descent 3.

504
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,530
Rym: Move in all possible directions.

505
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,970
Rym: Actually, if it wasn't like Star Trek.

506
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,670
Scott: Or Free Space.

507
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,269
Rym: You realize if it wasn't like Star Trek, Scott, it would be most likely very similar to Battlestar Galactica.

508
00:24:50,674 --> 00:24:51,530
Scott: Which Battlestar Galactica?

509
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:52,210
Rym: New one.

510
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:53,165
Scott: Yeah.

511
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,630
Scott: That was a pretty good space fighting game going on there.

512
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,990
Rym: But Star Trek I think is similarly plausible.

513
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,350
Scott: The point is, if there were space battles, all space- They would not be like Star Wars.

514
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:04,729
Rym: As much as we want them to be like Star Wars.

515
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,709
Scott: Also, the space fighters would be able to move in any possible direction.

516
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,930
Rym: There wouldn't be space fighters.

517
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,270
Rym: There'd be cannons that shoot you from light years away.

518
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,646
Scott: That also.

519
00:25:13,252 --> 00:25:14,010
Rym: Like Star Trek.

520
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,650
Scott: No, but they're right next to each other.

521
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,129
Rym: No, they're not.

522
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,146
Scott: Do you know how far away they are?

523
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:20,370
Scott: So that they can see each other and they can talk on the radio in real time.

524
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:21,330
Scott: On the video telephone.

525
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,509
Rym: How do you know it's actually real time?

526
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,330
Scott: They're talking on the video telephone in real time.

527
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:25,250
Rym: How do you know it's real time?

528
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:25,850
Scott: Because there's no delay.

529
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,110
Rym: How do you know there's no delay?

530
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,690
Scott: There's no delay.

531
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,050
Rym: How much Star Trek have you seen?

532
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,630
Scott: They can even talk to Earth in real time.

533
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,370
Rym: No, they can't.

534
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:31,865
Scott: No, they can't.

535
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,768
Rym: No, they can't.

536
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,507
Scott: I'm pretty sure they do.

537
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,089
Rym: So, my thing of the day.

538
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,934
Scott: They can even, the spaceship even goes faster than the light, so the radios definitely can go.

539
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,062
Scott: You know those videos.

540
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,082
Scott: Ansibles.

541
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,167
Rym: The videos where they make, someone takes a compilation of all the times.

542
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:46,268
Rym: Tom Hanks pees in a movie.

543
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:47,188
Scott: Oh, that's a good one.

544
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,290
Rym: Well, that is a good one.

545
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,850
Rym: We were at work the other day, right?

546
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:57,910
Rym: We're having this lunch meeting and we're talking about movies and Tom Hanks movies came up and I brought up my anecdote about Tom Hanks peeing in movies.

547
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,349
Rym: Nobody believed me.

548
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:00,148
Scott: And you watched it.

549
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,406
Rym: And I showed it and they were like, "Wow.

550
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,287
Rym: How did you find that or know

551
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:04,570
Rym: that?".

552
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,510
Scott: Because I look on the internet every day.

553
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,308
Scott: What are you looking at?

554
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:07,970
Scott: Television?

555
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,230
Rym: The internet makes us likened unto wizards and/or gods.

556
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,870
Rym: So this is a video that I'm happy someone made.

557
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,349
Rym: Dave Riley will love this video.

558
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:22,170
Rym: It is the great sandwiches from movies of all time.

559
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:22,970
Scott: Oh, snap.

560
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,630
Scott: I wonder, I can't even think of like that many great sandwiches.

561
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:26,665
Rym: It's got the PB&J.

562
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,769
Scott: Was there a Blondie and Dagwood movie?

563
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,870
Rym: Here's an example.

564
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:30,469
Rym: There was.

565
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:32,250
Rym: It's not in there, though.

566
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,365
Rym: You've never seen that movie?

567
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,170
Scott: No, but I'm sure it had a fucking giant sandwich in it.

568
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,070
Rym: It's black and white.

569
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,769
Rym: It's from the era of movies that you enjoy.

570
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,010
Scott: Does it have a gigantic sandwich?

571
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:41,328
Scott: Yes.

572
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:41,988
Scott: I'm sure it does.

573
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,370
Rym: Anyway, it's got the PB&J and the kid from the never-ending story.

574
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,659
Scott: Was there a Three Stooges sandwich?

575
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,830
Scott: that was pretty epic?

576
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:58,910
Rym: I don't want to spoil this thing, but the number one sandwich is the sandwich that Dave makes when he has the presidential kitchen in the movie Dave.

577
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,269
Scott: Oh, that's a fucking sandwich right there.

578
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,130
Rym: Dave is one of my favorite movies.

579
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,990
Scott: It's a great movie.

580
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,970
Scott: I thought it was one of my favorite movies, but it's a great movie that is not brought up enough.

581
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,450
Scott: You know what?

582
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,746
Rym: It's one of my favorite movies in the genre of politician.

583
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:11,570
Rym: does what's right.

584
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:22,289
Scott: It's actually kind of funny because I never made the connection until just now, but it's basically Sanctuary/Eagle, but from the US, and I saw that before I ever heard about Sanctuary or Eagle.

585
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:22,601
Scott: Yeah.

586
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:24,650
Scott: I think it's older than both of those.

587
00:27:24,971 --> 00:27:29,910
Rym: And Dave and Bullworth are actually very similar movies except that Bullworth has the more realistic ending.

588
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:39,430
Scott: Well, it's a rated G version, and I don't know if Dave is actually rated G, but it might be PG or PG-13 because there is a scene where the president has a heart attack having sex with a mistress.

589
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:53,570
Rym: If you've never seen the movie Dave, which was made in 1993, that was a long time ago, but I'm looking at the sandwich, and oh my God, I'm hungry now, when he's grating the carrots onto it at the end.

590
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,208
Scott: It's a movie everybody needs to see.

591
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,730
Scott: Oh, look at that sandwich.

592
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,690
Rym: Oh my God.

593
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,256
Scott: Yup.

594
00:27:58,773 --> 00:27:59,709
Scott: Oh, ah.

595
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,290
Scott: Taxpayers pay for that sandwich, but not really.

596
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,969
Scott: Movie budget paid for that sandwich.

597
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:08,670
Scott: I wonder how many times he had to do that scene where he made and ate the sandwich.

598
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,610
Rym: He even eats, they show him eating the sandwich.

599
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:11,389
Scott: I know.

600
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:12,189
Scott: Well, how could you not?

601
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:13,250
Rym: Yeah, it's a good sandwich.

602
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,649
Scott: And it'd be a really easy acting job, the eating part, so maybe there was only one take, but the making part might be hard.

603
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,950
Rym: You know, that doesn't always work out.

604
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,029
Rym: I mean, vitamin E to vegemin.

605
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:27,249
Scott: I'm just saying the making part might have had multiple takes, you know, and all the interns probably ate all those sandwiches.

606
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:36,009
Rym: As an aside, I'm curious, you youngins out there, you kids listening to GeekNights, does vitamin E to vegemin mean anything to you?

607
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:36,908
Scott: Maybe.

608
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:37,970
Rym: I'm curious.

609
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,250
Rym: Does it mean anything to you, Scott?

610
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:39,986
Scott: Yeah, I know what it is.

611
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:40,527
Scott: You do?

612
00:28:40,774 --> 00:28:40,950
Scott: Yeah.

613
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,098
Rym: Okay.

614
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:41,584
Rym: I'm curious.

615
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,369
Rym: Listeners, let me know if you know.

616
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,630
Scott: I'm not really a big fan, though.

617
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:45,065
Rym: No, I'm not.

618
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,390
Rym: Well, it's important to television history.

619
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:47,848
Rym: Yeah.

620
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,469
Rym: But I'm just curious.

621
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:54,430
Rym: I feel like that was common knowledge in our generation, and I don't know if it's still common knowledge.

622
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,010
Scott: It's not common knowledge in our generation.

623
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,510
Rym: I think it is, due to one factor and one factor alone.

624
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,430
Rym: Naked Night.

625
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,690
Scott: A lot of kids didn't watch Naked Night.

626
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:07,670
Scott: And plus, anyone who's like one or two years younger than us, by the time that they... It's not our generation.

627
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,570
Scott: Naked Night was gone.

628
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:09,470
Rym: Not our generation.

629
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,510
Rym: We've proven this.

630
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:20,290
Rym: You, me and Scojo remember all the same things from our childhood, and yet people born two years before us, completely different childhood, in terms of media.

631
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:28,124
Scott: But the point is, I bet there's a whole bunch of people who are exactly... I bet there are people even older than us, like early 30s people, do not know what it is.

632
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:28,668
Scott: Maybe not.

633
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,450
Rym: The Naked Night factor.

634
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:36,857
Rym: I think almost anyone born in America between 1979 and 1983 knows what vitamin and vegemin is.

635
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,850
Scott: I don't know, because remember they moved it to TV Land, a different station?

636
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:40,538
Scott: That's when...

637
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:42,288
Rym: Yeah, that was the end.

638
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,170
Scott: And then when SNCC came around.

639
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:45,268
Rym: Oh my God, SNCC.

640
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,309
Scott: And there was no more... You couldn't really see Naked Night unless you stayed up way too late.

641
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:55,670
Rym: And of course, in the meta moment, the GeekNights book club, book club book, is still Isaac Asimov's foundation.

642
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,430
Scott: Yup, other interesting things, events around the town.

643
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,190
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX Prime, if you wanna buy a badge.

644
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,430
Scott: That's a long time from now.

645
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,310
Rym: They're sold out, so, fucked.

646
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,910
Scott: You could buy a bunch of single day badges, loser.

647
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:09,706
Scott: Anyway.

648
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:11,149
Rym: We might be at PAX Dev.

649
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,090
Rym: Might be at Ode Account.

650
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:20,429
Scott: May 21st and 22nd is BarCampNYC, you gotta go to the website and register, even though it's free.

651
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,949
Scott: You have to register for each day separately, but it's free.

652
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:24,008
Scott: You should go.

653
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,350
Scott: I'm helping organize that shit, even though I'm gonna be really tired, because I'm gonna be up all night Friday, May 20th in the library.

654
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,270
Rym: Running around the library, chasing Slimer.

655
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,130
Scott: I don't think I'll be running around the library.

656
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,110
Scott: Other interesting events.

657
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:40,090
Rym: This weekend, Board Game Night, NerdNYC, down at Think Coffee.

658
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:40,418
Scott: Friday.

659
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,287
Scott: Friday.

660
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:46,750
Scott: And June 18th is Recess All Day, Board Game Night, basically.

661
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:48,450
Scott: And that's good enough.

662
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,269
Rym: Yeah, that's good enough.

663
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:50,809
Scott: You should follow me on Twitter.

664
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,530
Rym: And you should follow me on Twitter.

665
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:53,428
Scott: A-P-R-E-C-H-E.

666
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:53,830
Rym: You know what?

667
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:59,750
Rym: Follow @APRECHE, @S-C-H-E-Z-A-R, and @GeekNights.

668
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:02,230
Rym: Rhymes with weeknights.

669
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:04,489
Scott: I think they can figure that one out.

670
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,089
Rym: You know, it amazes me.

671
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,650
Rym: It's weird.

672
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,010
Rym: People I talk to who are our age, who are connected to the internet, I'm like, "Geek

673
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,370
Rym: Nights."

674
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:11,845
Rym: And they're like, "Oh,

675
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:11,990
Rym: okay."

676
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,667
Rym: And they just Google it.

677
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:19,329
Rym: People who aren't super internet-y, or who are a lot older, usually I say, "Geek

678
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:19,530
Rym: Nights.".

679
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:20,964
Rym: They're like, "How do I find

680
00:31:20,985 --> 00:31:21,025
Rym: it?"

681
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:22,608
Rym: And I'm like, "Google for

682
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:22,690
Rym: it."

683
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,501
Rym: And they're like, "Google for

684
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:23,724
Rym: what?".

685
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:24,801
Rym: I'm like, "Geek

686
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:25,147
Rym: Nights.".

687
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:26,184
Rym: "What do you mean, 'Geek

688
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:26,509
Rym: Nights'?"?

689
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,490
Rym: Like, "Weeknights, but geek.

690
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:29,621
Rym: Can you spell that for

691
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:29,743
Rym: me?".

692
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:35,890
Rym: This happens to be a lot of conventions.

693
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:41,610
Scott: And this is why, in the olden days, old people were smarter than the young people, right?

694
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,147
Scott: When an old man walks in?

695
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:49,410
Scott: They had the years and years of experience and knowledge built up in their brains, whereas young people didn't.

696
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,350
Scott: And the young people needed to live and learn and learn and learn and learn to get enough in their brains to become old people.

697
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,870
Scott: But now, everyone has a library in their pocket.

698
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:04,069
Scott: And only young people actually go to the library, whereas old people are still going to the library.

699
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,610
Rym: I feel like I need to differentiate, because there's two kinds of old.

700
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:09,609
Rym: We need separate words.

701
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,590
Rym: Because on one hand, there's physically old, like you've lived longer.

702
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,601
Scott: No, I'm saying old of mind.

703
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,969
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying you do generate, by being older, even of mind, wisdom.

704
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:25,469
Rym: I know a lot of weird stuff about being alive that I realized, talking to punk kids in the forum, they don't know.

705
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:28,210
Rym: They don't know things about checking accounts.

706
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:31,147
Scott: No, but you can learn them if you go on Google.

707
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,110
Rym: Yeah, but I learned them because I'm old.

708
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:35,422
Scott: It just happens.

709
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,508
Scott: I learned them because I got a checking account.

710
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:37,900
Scott: Yeah.

711
00:32:38,152 --> 00:32:39,205
Scott: I went to the bank and said,

712
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:39,387
Scott: "Hey.".

713
00:32:39,631 --> 00:32:40,848
Rym: Yeah, but you knew to even do that.

714
00:32:42,513 --> 00:32:44,050
Scott: I wonder about checking accounts.

715
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,150
Scott: Maybe I should go to the bank or the bank's website.

716
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:55,621
Rym: But anyway, I think really what it comes down to is people who are conservative, generally conservative, as in this far, no farther.

717
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:01,950
Rym: Those are the people who don't realize they can just go to Google.

718
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:03,010
Rym: Not even go to Google.

719
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:11,609
Rym: If they just go to the bar at the top of their computer, because the Internet Explorer is the computer, and type GeekNights, it'll probably get to us.

720
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,370
Scott: Yeah, probably.

721
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:16,070
Rym: Anyway, talking about memory.

722
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:23,228
Scott: Right, so we got this idea because a lot of people don't understand how memory in a computer works.

723
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:36,376
Rym: The same argument comes up in our forum regularly where someone says, "I prefer browser X over browser Y or application X over application Y because application Y uses way more memory than

724
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:36,642
Rym: X.".

725
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,670
Scott: Right, we'll get to that because that's what spurred this idea on.

726
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:47,970
Scott: We'll discuss that issue later, but we decided let's do a show on memory, period, because people don't know how that shit works, right?

727
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,469
Scott: So basically, the thing is your computer, the number one most important thing in a computer is memory.

728
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:55,710
Rym: Because a processor can process all it wants.

729
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,890
Rym: All right, I add two binary numbers, great.

730
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,389
Rym: Where does the answer go?

731
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:05,967
Scott: Right, a transistor can be on or off, but it's basically doing work.

732
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,319
Scott: It's like a saw.

733
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:15,650
Scott: A saw can cut two pieces of wood, but you got to put the wood somewhere after it falls off the edge of the cutting board, right?

734
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:22,530
Scott: So memory can hold a zero or a one in it and keep that zero or one there.

735
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,290
Scott: A transistor can't hold on to a zero or one.

736
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,149
Rym: Well, it can if you don't ever give it anything else.

737
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,850
Scott: Yeah, but you can't read, you know, it's not memory, right?

738
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,909
Scott: So memory is pretty much any, you know, anything that can hold on to data.

739
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:39,070
Scott: You can say memory, remember this zero, okay.

740
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,790
Scott: And then later you can come back and say memory, what are you holding in you?

741
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:43,848
Scott: And he'll say zero, sir.

742
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,949
Scott: That is memory.

743
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:45,870
Rym: I mean, think of it this way.

744
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:52,170
Rym: If I make a really simple circuit, just wires that represent binary numbers, I can add them together with a very simple circuit.

745
00:34:52,512 --> 00:34:53,768
Rym: I don't even need transistors.

746
00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:54,130
Scott: Nope.

747
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:55,797
Rym: And the result will come out.

748
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:57,670
Scott: the other end, which are probably made of transistors.

749
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:04,110
Rym: So if I connect the end to light bulbs, I have a circuit that performs one calculation once forever.

750
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:05,009
Scott: Yep.

751
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,830
Rym: So if I turn the computer off and turn it back on, it gives me the same answer again.

752
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,298
Scott: Yep.

753
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:18,310
Scott: So a CPU with its billions of transistors, right, can do a lot of work of adding and multiplying and dividing and moving and reading and writing.

754
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:23,410
Scott: But it can't actually remember anything except for the fact that it has a little bit of memory in it.

755
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:28,969
Scott: The most important memory in the whole computer, the registers, the memory that only computer scientists know about.

756
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:38,589
Scott: How many registers do you think are like in, I mean, every different chip in the world has different kind of chip, at least has different numbers of registers of different sizes with different purposes.

757
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,908
Rym: The numbers have gone up.

758
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:40,297
Rym: Yeah.

759
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:48,050
Scott: But I think I'm pretty sure that like an x86 CPU or a 64 bit CPU only has like eight or 16 registers in it.

760
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:49,661
Scott: It's not a lot of registers.

761
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:50,950
Scott: and the registers.

762
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:52,144
Scott: Guess how big they are?

763
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:54,670
Rym: I wonder if they've guessed.

764
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,130
Rym: I wonder if we should do this like Blue's Clues.

765
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:56,685
Scott: I don't know.

766
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:02,890
Scott: But yeah, if you haven't figured it out, in a 64 bit chip, each register holds 64 bits usually, right?

767
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,623
Rym: So it used to be that it mattered a lot.

768
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:08,610
Rym: as to when you're thinking about performance.

769
00:36:09,111 --> 00:36:12,610
Rym: People talk about level one cache, level two cache, level three cache.

770
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:15,990
Rym: And if we want the broader picture, let's zoom way out from registers.

771
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,149
Rym: The CPU is doing stuff.

772
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,170
Rym: You've got memory right at the CPU.

773
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,030
Rym: Like the memory, the CPU is directly accessing the registers on its die, in fact.

774
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:26,589
Scott: The registers.

775
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:26,978
Scott: Yeah.

776
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:27,398
Rym: Yeah.

777
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:34,668
Rym: And as you zoom out, you've got memory that's further and further away, both physically and computationally from the CPU.

778
00:36:35,355 --> 00:36:36,510
Rym: It's further away physically.

779
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,549
Rym: So it takes more time to get stuff out of it.

780
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:45,849
Rym: It's further away temporarily because usually to make it bigger, you have to have levels of abstraction on top of it.

781
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:50,306
Rym: You know, you address the memory like, give me this chunk of memory, give me that chunk of memory.

782
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:52,290
Scott: You're getting way too ahead of yourself here.

783
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,890
Scott: Basically, you know, the thing is memory, right?

784
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,250
Scott: There's a quantum problem here, right?

785
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:01,310
Scott: And that you want to have a lot of memory, but memory takes up a lot of space.

786
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:06,030
Scott: And even though it's a couple inches, that matters a fuck ton, right?

787
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,810
Scott: A transistor is a quantum device.

788
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:11,470
Scott: It's operating on the level of electrons, right?

789
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,390
Scott: So if the thing is an inch away, that makes all the difference in the universe.

790
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:25,510
Scott: That's why the memory that is closest to the CPU, basically the fastest memory there is, is so tiny because that's all you can fit in a small enough space to actually work that quickly.

791
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:31,030
Rym: Now, there are more concerns, too, about power and addressing and we're not I mean, you don't care about the core level.

792
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,169
Rym: No one cares, except computer engineers.

793
00:37:34,115 --> 00:37:35,129
Rym: Even they often don't care.

794
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:39,429
Rym: But basically, the point I want to get at is that you've got these you've got this hierarchy of memory.

795
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:42,390
Rym: And as you go further away, it gets slower and slower and slower.

796
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:51,210
Rym: You know, then eventually after all these caches, you get to the RAM and then after that, you get to the disks and then after that, you get to stuff you've stored out on the Internet.

797
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:51,673
Rym: Yeah.

798
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:54,010
Rym: And then after that, you get to stuff stored on tape.

799
00:37:54,353 --> 00:37:56,070
Rym: I mean, tape is memory.

800
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:58,248
Rym: It's just really fucking slow to get at it.

801
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,867
Scott: Some guys got to go to the closet to get it.

802
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,170
Scott: You got to put it in the machine.

803
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:03,410
Scott: You got to run the tape through.

804
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,429
Scott: All right.

805
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:07,310
Scott: But anyway, you know, the way a computer works, right?

806
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,429
Scott: People don't seem to realize this when you turn it on.

807
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:14,630
Scott: What a computer does use most computers is they look at addresses in memory, right?

808
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,570
Scott: All the memory in the whole computer has addresses.

809
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:23,550
Scott: And the computer, when it turns on, looks at address number zero usually, at least in most computers.

810
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:31,830
Scott: And it takes whatever is in the memory at address number zero, loads it into a register and then does whatever that says to do.

811
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:46,130
Scott: And usually it'll say something like, you know, go to address, you know, read some memory from, you know, read from the disk this and put it in this area of memory and then move forward to number one and start working again.

812
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:46,814
Rym: So think of this.

813
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:48,990
Rym: You got bio, you know, computer starts from nothing.

814
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,173
Rym: It executes one hard coded instruction and it that tells it where to look, where to look, where to look.

815
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,590
Rym: Eventually, it's the bootloader hits.

816
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,355
Rym: The disk pulls up the beginning of your operating system, which then loads the rest of the operating system.

817
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,110
Scott: Think of it like you have a book of instructions.

818
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:01,712
Scott: Right.

819
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:04,270
Scott: And the instructions all have line numbers on them.

820
00:39:04,371 --> 00:39:05,749
Scott: It's like a choose your own adventure book.

821
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:06,172
Scott: Right.

822
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:09,370
Scott: And it starts at zero, a really boring one, a really boring one.

823
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,690
Scott: It starts at zero and there's an instruction and you follow the instruction.

824
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,936
Scott: And then, you know, you go.

825
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:18,196
Scott: if it doesn't tell you to go somewhere else, you just go to one and do the next instruction.

826
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:25,220
Scott: And if that doesn't tell you to go somewhere else, like go to number 30 or something like that, you go to number two and just follow the instructions straight through.

827
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,970
Scott: And that's the computer.

828
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,994
Scott: That's how a computer works.

829
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:32,550
Scott: And the way it does this is there's a register that has the current number of the line it's on.

830
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,349
Scott: So it always remember what line it's on right now.

831
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:40,409
Scott: And there's another register that has the thing you should do right now, the current instruction that you should be doing.

832
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:53,410
Scott: And all the computer does is it looks in the memory at, you know, whatever number it's supposed to be on, follows that instruction and then makes the number go up by one and follow the next instruction.

833
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:54,610
Scott: That's all the computer does.

834
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,496
Scott: It just goes through.

835
00:39:55,557 --> 00:39:57,170
Scott: the memory is where all the instructions are.

836
00:39:57,473 --> 00:39:58,689
Scott: It's the most important thing.

837
00:39:59,051 --> 00:39:59,593
Rym: Oh, my God.

838
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:06,010
Rym: I just noticed that my thing of the day, that line underneath says this also serves as an in memoriam reel.

839
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,010
Rym: And I realized that every one of those sandwiches died in the course of production.

840
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:17,010
Rym: Anyway, so all that stuff, the core of it doesn't really matter.

841
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,651
Rym: You should understand like you should remember what registers are and caches and everything.

842
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:26,692
Rym: But really, everything under RAM, faster than RAM doesn't matter to the average user.

843
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:30,750
Rym: You buy a CPU, whatever CPU you buy has all that.

844
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:41,996
Rym: Like like when you think about the subtle differences between a Xeon processor or, you know, an I7, I9, I5 core, whatever, some of that has to do with how much caching it has, how many registers.

845
00:40:42,017 --> 00:40:43,550
Rym: that's where they are, how they're accessed.

846
00:40:44,412 --> 00:40:46,030
Scott: But well, the number of registers isn't going to be there.

847
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,690
Rym: Well, yeah, but how they're accessed, how much cash there is.

848
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,570
Rym: Is there a level two cash, level three cash?

849
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,249
Rym: You know, all that stuff is an on die off die.

850
00:40:54,450 --> 00:41:00,730
Scott: Basically, the way it works is computers generally automatically write like let's say you're watching a video or something like that.

851
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,071
Scott: Right.

852
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,452
Scott: Well, it loads the video from the hard drive into the memory so it can actually read it.

853
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:11,610
Scott: And then, you know, if there's a the program that's actually decoding the video, right, is probably getting used a whole lot.

854
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:17,014
Scott: So it'll probably move some parts of that program or the whole thing into the cache because it keeps going.

855
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:20,188
Scott: It keeps using that all so often, you know, that it can.

856
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:24,890
Scott: the computer can go a lot faster if it keeps that data closer to the CPU.

857
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:26,770
Rym: Now, the same thing happens at every level.

858
00:41:27,032 --> 00:41:29,750
Rym: So the level that matters to you guys is RAM because you do the same thing.

859
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,890
Rym: You've got shit on the disk and shit in your RAM.

860
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:40,110
Rym: If you pull something from the disk into RAM to do something with it, because it's a lot faster, RAM is orders of magnitude faster than the disk.

861
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,810
Scott: Even if you have a solid state drive, it's still orders of magnitude faster.

862
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:53,589
Rym: It's a good idea if you've got a lot of RAM to keep whatever you just read off the disk in the RAM because it costs you almost nothing to get rid of it from the RAM if you don't need it anymore.

863
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,710
Rym: But if it's in the RAM, it's really fast to do that thing again.

864
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:02,670
Rym: And at every level between any two kinds of memory, the same basic logic is going on.

865
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:09,809
Rym: This is why it doesn't matter that applications use a lot of RAM unless you don't have enough RAM.

866
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,992
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much like, you know, let's say you're thinking about your wallet, right?

867
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:37,749
Scott: You got a bunch of credit cards in your wallet and you put the credit card that you use the most often in the front and you put the credit card that use the least often in the back and that, you know, and every every time you use a credit card, you move it to the front, then eventually they're going to automatically be arranged in this really efficient, you know, you know, way to where the most used ones are the easiest to get at and you'll save the most time.

868
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,722
Rym: You take a hit if you got to get the credit card.

869
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:40,990
Rym: that's not in the nice part.

870
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,850
Rym: There's like buried under your license, your driver's license or something.

871
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:45,249
Rym: It's like when you have a cash miss.

872
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:45,751
Scott: Yeah.

873
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:48,450
Scott: But the thing is, you know, that that'll help you go the fastest.

874
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:54,070
Scott: But it's not like, you know, you're going to be better off if you leave some empty slots in your wallet, right?

875
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,930
Scott: Empty slots don't get you anything.

876
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:04,350
Scott: You might as well put some cards in there because maybe you will need them and it'll be a lot slower to go back home and get them than if they were in those empty slots.

877
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:10,369
Scott: So there is no reason not to fill up your entire wallet if you have enough cards to fill up the whole wallet.

878
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:24,050
Rym: Where this misconception that Firefox or something using a ton of RAM is a bad idea that came from seems to be that for a long time, Linux, the philosophy of memory management in Unix and Linux systems was use all the goddamn RAM.

879
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:25,481
Scott: It still is.

880
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:26,310
Rym: It always has been.

881
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,530
Scott: If you go, Linux automatically does this for you without even realizing it.

882
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:34,730
Scott: It automatically caches as much as it can from disk no matter what.

883
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:41,350
Scott: And if you type free space minus M on the command line on a Linux machine, it'll show you how much memory is free and used.

884
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,590
Scott: And there'll be one line.

885
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,390
Scott: This is plus minus buffers cache.

886
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:51,870
Scott: And even though it might seem to you by reading that chart that you have zero memory free, the fact is you actually have a lot free.

887
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:56,714
Scott: It's just caching so much from the disk so that it doesn't have to go and read from the slow ass hard drive.

888
00:43:56,754 --> 00:43:59,830
Rym: I mean, basically you play MP3 and the MP3 is five megs.

889
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:03,190
Rym: The whole thing is just in RAM unless something else needs that RAM.

890
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:03,631
Scott: Yeah.

891
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:09,053
Scott: Linux keeps, you know, your dentist card that you use once every six months in the wallet.

892
00:44:09,174 --> 00:44:12,170
Scott: if you just used it, because, you know, well, why not?

893
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,397
Scott: I'm not I don't have anything else in the wallet, so maybe I'll maybe I'll get my teeth knocked out.

894
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:17,769
Scott: I don't want to have to go back home to get it.

895
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,290
Rym: Many people didn't know about computers.

896
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,013
Rym: They had a Windows computer back in like the three days, the 311 days, the Windows 95 days.

897
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:28,254
Rym: And one of the metrics of performance they'd always look at is how much free RAM do they have?

898
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:29,970
Scott: Well, that was very important in those days.

899
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,510
Rym: If they didn't have a lot of free RAM, they'd want to get some more.

900
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,735
Rym: They'd complain about stuff using a lot of RAM, which was kind of legit because Windows didn't cache a lot.

901
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:41,649
Rym: If the RAM was used, it was usually being used by a program and you'd be hitting the swap because you never had enough RAM.

902
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:47,693
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing is if you run out of space, if you use all of your RAM, then you have a problem.

903
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:54,130
Scott: because what happens is the computers do a thing called paging to where all the things that are in memory are stored in pages like pages of a book.

904
00:44:54,471 --> 00:45:01,570
Scott: And what will happen is it'll take pages if your RAM is full and it still needs to put more things in the RAM because it can't work directly off the disk.

905
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,979
Scott: It has to work off, you know, has to.

906
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,211
Scott: it can only follow instructions that are in the memory.

907
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:14,210
Scott: It'll actually take pages from memory, write those pages onto the hard drive and then read from the hard drive and put it in the new empty space.

908
00:45:14,571 --> 00:45:30,814
Scott: And the thing is, sometimes what happens is if you have like two applications that are both working at the same time and there's no memory left, you'll get what's called thrashing to where it's constantly taking pages out of memory, putting them on the disk, taking pages off the disk, putting them into memory, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

909
00:45:31,055 --> 00:45:39,611
Scott: And you're at a RAM and it's using your hard drive like RAM and your computer slows to a crawl and your disk goes because it's thrashing all the time.

910
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:41,789
Scott: And that is bad if you're right out of RAM.

911
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:44,950
Rym: So, I look at my computer right now, you know, I'm recording GeekNights right now.

912
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:45,371
Rym: I got a bug.

913
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:46,577
Rym: I got Firefox open.

914
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:49,310
Rym: It's been open for like weeks doing stuff.

915
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,489
Rym: And right now I got six gigs of RAM.

916
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:52,417
Scott: That's a lot.

917
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:53,610
Rym: You know why I have six gigs?

918
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,589
Rym: Because I have six DIMMs and I had to populate three.

919
00:45:58,151 --> 00:46:01,190
Rym: So two gigabyte DIMMs were really the only thing I could get.

920
00:46:01,431 --> 00:46:04,574
Scott: You weren't going to use one gig sticks because then you'd have three gigs, which isn't enough.

921
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:06,630
Scott: And four is about right, though.

922
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,909
Rym: Now I'm thinking about getting more.

923
00:46:08,171 --> 00:46:08,949
Scott: What do you need more for?

924
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:09,929
Rym: Well, video editing.

925
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:10,752
Scott: Maybe.

926
00:46:10,872 --> 00:46:22,350
Rym: But anyway, right now, recording GeekNights with my FireWire and all this stuff, I got three gigs of RAM cached and about two gigs available, not even used.

927
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:30,229
Rym: And yet Firefox is using four hundred and eleven, four hundred and twelve, four hundred and thirteen, four hundred and fourteen megabytes.

928
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:30,691
Scott: Yep.

929
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:33,110
Scott: And people are like, oh, my God, it's using so much.

930
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,490
Scott: And it's like, well, is it crashing?

931
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,075
Scott: Well, no.

932
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,130
Rym: Audition, meanwhile.

933
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:36,820
Scott: Is it swapping?

934
00:46:36,942 --> 00:46:37,249
Scott: Well, no.

935
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:41,860
Rym: Audition which is recording GeekNights currently is using one hundred and eighty megabytes.

936
00:46:42,306 --> 00:46:42,550
Scott: All right.

937
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:44,049
Scott: You know, it's back in the day.

938
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:50,510
Scott: You actually would have problems because you would try to play a game like, say, MEC Warrior 2 and it would use eight megabytes of RAM.

939
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:55,039
Scott: So if you had an eight megabyte of RAM computer, you couldn't really do anything else at the same time.

940
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,130
Scott: It would be quite troublesome.

941
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:00,970
Rym: Now, specifically with Firefox or Chrome or browsers, whatever browser people are complaining about where they say it's slow.

942
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:02,236
Rym: Usually it's not.

943
00:47:02,296 --> 00:47:04,290
Rym: But forget that where they're saying it's using too much memory.

944
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:08,390
Rym: The browser for most users is 90 percent of what they do on the computer.

945
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,270
Rym: The browser basically is their computer.

946
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:10,571
Scott: Yeah.

947
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:16,770
Scott: And if you're if it's if you're using the browser for 90 percent of your work, then you should have no problem letting it use 90 percent of your RAM.

948
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,304
Rym: You want it to use as much RAM as it can because that'll just make your browsing faster and easier.

949
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:21,770
Scott: Yeah.

950
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:23,230
Scott: I mean, what is what is it doing?

951
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:24,296
Scott: It's caching things.

952
00:47:24,376 --> 00:47:34,492
Scott: It's remembering things that it downloaded from the Internet and holding them in RAM so that if you if you need them again, that it'll be able to get them very quickly and it won't have to go back home to get your dentist card again.

953
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:37,410
Scott: If you go back to that website again, that's all it's doing.

954
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,370
Scott: And who cares if it's using memory?

955
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:41,930
Scott: It doesn't hurt you unless you run out of memory.

956
00:47:42,352 --> 00:47:42,633
Scott: And it's.

957
00:47:42,855 --> 00:47:45,953
Scott: and the thing is, it's smart enough to look at how much memory you have free.

958
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:46,698
Scott: Right.

959
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,350
Scott: So that it doesn't use all your memory.

960
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,182
Scott: It's not stupid.

961
00:47:49,202 --> 00:47:49,670
Scott: Right.

962
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,550
Scott: It's not going to be like, oh, look, we're using all the memory.

963
00:47:53,013 --> 00:47:54,630
Scott: You know, I guess we should use even more.

964
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,098
Scott: It's not stupid.

965
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:57,430
Scott: It goes, oh, shit, we're out of memory.

966
00:47:58,631 --> 00:47:59,013
Scott: Let's see.

967
00:47:59,094 --> 00:48:01,670
Scott: Are we using this card more often or this card more often?

968
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,274
Scott: Well, let's take the most often used card, keep it in the wallet and get rid of the other one.

969
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:06,850
Scott: It's not dumb, right?

970
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,451
Scott: It's not going to make you swap unless there is absolutely no card that it can get rid of.

971
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:14,750
Rym: Now, many people might say, but but but what about my phone?

972
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:15,351
Rym: Yeah.

973
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:21,990
Rym: You write a special browser that handles, you know, memory management is very different on a compact device or device where power usage matters.

974
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:28,393
Scott: The other thing is that there are programs out there that have what are called memory leaks.

975
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:29,158
Scott: Right.

976
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:30,750
Scott: And this is this is kind of a situation.

977
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:30,951
Scott: Right.

978
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:38,750
Scott: When you're writing a program, if you're writing in Java or Python or something like that, there is an automatic system called a garbage collector.

979
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:43,393
Scott: And what this does is, you know, as you're programming, you're making a variable, putting it in memory.

980
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,690
Scott: You're using it and then maybe you don't need it anymore.

981
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:49,190
Scott: And you go on to use some other variables or some objects.

982
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:49,552
Scott: Right.

983
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:52,891
Scott: And maybe you load some data from a database, use it, and then you don't need it anymore.

984
00:48:53,353 --> 00:48:57,470
Scott: Well, if you're writing in Java or Python or any garbage collected language.

985
00:48:57,751 --> 00:48:57,993
Scott: Right.

986
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:00,470
Scott: Those things that you don't need anymore that are in memory.

987
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:04,890
Scott: Will slowly but surely be removed from memory by the garbage collector.

988
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:05,712
Scott: Right.

989
00:49:05,732 --> 00:49:10,556
Scott: So that, you know, your program, you know, won't, you know, slowly grow and grow and grow for no reason.

990
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:13,030
Scott: It'll only grow as far as it needs to grow.

991
00:49:13,311 --> 00:49:13,593
Scott: Right.

992
00:49:13,633 --> 00:49:16,370
Scott: You know, you won't be like, oh, here's a card that I'm going to use once.

993
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:21,142
Scott: There's a one used metro card and I'm going to leave that one used metro card in my wallet forever, even though I used it once already.

994
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:22,330
Scott: that it doesn't do that.

995
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:22,694
Scott: It's not.

996
00:49:22,755 --> 00:49:23,609
Scott: it's smart enough not to.

997
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:36,450
Scott: But if you write a program and say C, C++, Objective C, some sort of non garbage collected compiled language, you as the program or when you're writing this program need to manually manage the memory.

998
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:42,393
Scott: You need to specifically code, you know, take this data, put it in the memory, do a bunch of stuff.

999
00:49:42,514 --> 00:49:45,650
Scott: Now take that data and remove it from the memory.

1000
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:47,550
Scott: You need to actually code that specific thing.

1001
00:49:48,012 --> 00:49:48,213
Scott: Right.

1002
00:49:48,294 --> 00:49:50,650
Scott: In Java, you don't need to ever say remove that from the memory.

1003
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,389
Scott: You can now, but you don't want to.

1004
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:57,070
Rym: At the same time, many, many Java written applications have huge memory leaks.

1005
00:49:57,271 --> 00:49:59,090
Scott: Well, that's a that's a different problem altogether.

1006
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:05,409
Rym: Well, that's just due to the fact that people effectively will leave objects open in a context where they could still be used.

1007
00:50:05,832 --> 00:50:06,034
Rym: Yeah.

1008
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:07,850
Rym: And thus will never be garbage collected.

1009
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:13,672
Rym: And thus through every iteration of a loop, a new object, object, object, object, object, object.

1010
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:23,309
Scott: It is possible to make a memory leak in a garbage collected environment, but it is more common that it will happen in a non garbage collecting environment regardless because you're relying on fallible humans.

1011
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:23,750
Scott: Yes.

1012
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:31,150
Scott: It is possible to write a program that will just fill up the memory slowly but surely with stuff that is not needed in the memory.

1013
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:37,609
Scott: And then what will happen is your whole computer will slow to a crawl once it runs out of memory and can't remove anything from the memory.

1014
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:40,310
Scott: What's interesting is because the program is written poorly.

1015
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:42,139
Rym: What's interesting is a lot of people.

1016
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,770
Rym: this is kind of a more technical aside.

1017
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,770
Rym: Windows and Linux handle the situation very differently.

1018
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:55,290
Rym: And I realized looking at the Internet for some unrelated thing that many people have encountered something scary in the Linux world.

1019
00:50:55,732 --> 00:51:00,490
Rym: They'll be using their computer and it slows down and suddenly shit starts crashing.

1020
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:01,010
Scott: Yeah.

1021
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:04,270
Rym: And they look in varlog messages or usually they didn't configure logging.

1022
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:04,570
Rym: Right.

1023
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:09,210
Rym: So the console starts writing this line OOM killer invoked.

1024
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:09,771
Scott: Yeah.

1025
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:14,973
Scott: So Linux in the kernel has a thing called the OOM killer out of memory, the out of memory killer.

1026
00:51:15,014 --> 00:51:22,850
Scott: And what it does is when your computer runs out of memory and runs out of swap space so it can't even do the page thrashing to the disk anymore.

1027
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,630
Scott: It is literally out of memory.

1028
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,209
Scott: It usually has nowhere to go.

1029
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:36,590
Rym: Usually happens when you've got an application that is crashing in such a way, which is actually fairly common, especially with demons that are poorly written or that do something very intensive like market data handlers.

1030
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,810
Scott: Or someone has like an infinite fork loop that they wrote in a bash.

1031
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,570
Rym: They'll get out of control and just fill the RAM in the space of a second.

1032
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:42,930
Scott: Yeah.

1033
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:48,210
Scott: What Linux will do is it will based on priorities, this prioritizing algorithm.

1034
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,890
Rym: It's semi random in some cases.

1035
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:50,374
Scott: Semi.

1036
00:51:50,395 --> 00:51:50,889
Scott: It depends.

1037
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:51,172
Scott: Right.

1038
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,110
Scott: You can go look up the algorithm.

1039
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:53,290
Rym: I don't even know the algorithm.

1040
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:55,090
Scott: It will pick a process.

1041
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:58,170
Scott: It'll pick something that is using memory and kill it.

1042
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:07,950
Scott: So let's say you've got Firefox and Apache server and an instant message client and an evil thing and my SQL server.

1043
00:52:08,171 --> 00:52:10,269
Rym: Never mind the million other things that are running in the back.

1044
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:10,552
Scott: Yeah.

1045
00:52:10,573 --> 00:52:11,230
Scott: And they're all running.

1046
00:52:11,592 --> 00:52:11,814
Scott: Right.

1047
00:52:11,854 --> 00:52:13,710
Scott: And suddenly your computer runs out of memory.

1048
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:14,153
Scott: Right.

1049
00:52:14,374 --> 00:52:16,910
Scott: The Linux kernel will be just like my SQL.

1050
00:52:17,652 --> 00:52:18,257
Scott: I pick you.

1051
00:52:18,479 --> 00:52:19,869
Scott: You are now gone and it just kills it.

1052
00:52:20,293 --> 00:52:22,030
Scott: And now suddenly there's a whole bunch of free memory.

1053
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:24,070
Scott: The Linux kernel basically just reaches into your wallet.

1054
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,810
Scott: It's like we were out of room in this wallet for more cards.

1055
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,930
Scott: And I have a card that has to go in the wallet.

1056
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,849
Scott: Well, I'm picking a card out of the wallet and I'm throwing it in the shredder.

1057
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,790
Scott: And now we've got cards are all in place again.

1058
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,370
Rym: Now, the thing is, very rarely will the O.M.

1059
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:43,329
Rym: killer save you because usually it kills something that you wanted to be running or even if it kills stuff you didn't want.

1060
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:45,810
Rym: Whatever went crazy is like, oh, more RAM.

1061
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,099
Scott: Yeah, goodie.

1062
00:52:47,321 --> 00:52:48,189
Scott: But the thing is, the O.M.

1063
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:50,430
Scott: killer probably will eventually kill the evil thing.

1064
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:53,310
Scott: But the thing is, the evil thing is usually something that you want running.

1065
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:53,912
Rym: Yeah.

1066
00:52:53,932 --> 00:52:56,345
Scott: So pretty much no matter what, you're going to be either.

1067
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:57,732
Scott: your computer will keep working.

1068
00:52:57,873 --> 00:52:58,074
Scott: Right.

1069
00:52:58,114 --> 00:52:58,556
Scott: And you'll.

1070
00:52:58,898 --> 00:53:05,993
Scott: you'll be able to fix it because the computer will have free memory to be able to connect to it and log in and enter commands to solve the problem, which is great.

1071
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,451
Scott: The problem is, is something that you wanted to keep running is now not running.

1072
00:53:09,472 --> 00:53:12,590
Rym: Well, the two cases I've run into primarily with the O.M.

1073
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,448
Rym: killer and my advice to all of you, a lot of people Google on the Internet looking for what do I do to recover from the O.M.

1074
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:18,995
Rym: killer?

1075
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:19,684
Rym: You know what?

1076
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:20,090
Rym: Reboot.

1077
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:26,234
Rym: That's usually the only safe way because you don't know what it killed and you don't know how it killed it.

1078
00:53:26,254 --> 00:53:31,410
Scott: It might if it killed it with kill dash nine, that program might have ended in a weird state, especially if it was like a database.

1079
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,930
Rym: I mean, you want to recover manually.

1080
00:53:33,231 --> 00:53:33,512
Rym: All right.

1081
00:53:33,572 --> 00:53:41,469
Rym: Dig through VAR log messages and figure out what it killed in what order and then run an LSOF to figure out what files are still being held open by zombie processes.

1082
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:42,869
Scott: Yes, a lot of ways.

1083
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:44,177
Rym: Basically, you got to reboot.

1084
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:45,889
Rym: But to usually when I see O.M.

1085
00:53:46,452 --> 00:53:53,070
Rym: killer invoked and it didn't somehow kill the bad process, it'll end up getting to a knit and then your machine's done.

1086
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:53,671
Rym: Yeah.

1087
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:55,809
Rym: And then you have to reboot because there's literally nothing you can do.

1088
00:53:56,331 --> 00:53:56,654
Rym: Right.

1089
00:53:56,674 --> 00:53:58,290
Scott: Windows, on the other hand, basically just goes.

1090
00:53:59,391 --> 00:53:59,592
Rym: Yeah.

1091
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:04,390
Rym: Windows, even Windows servers for just sits there forever.

1092
00:54:04,851 --> 00:54:05,414
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

1093
00:54:05,896 --> 00:54:10,497
Scott: And there's you have to just like hard rebooted yet to push the reset button because it just it just will.

1094
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:12,870
Rym: just it'll try guys out there.

1095
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:19,511
Rym: If you have to physically touch a machine to reboot it, oh, my, my machine did it pretty much.

1096
00:54:20,033 --> 00:54:25,933
Rym: You should have some sort of RAT card, open manage, at least whatever, at the least KVF.

1097
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:26,255
Scott: Yep.

1098
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:28,909
Rym: Got to have something to remotely reboot shit.

1099
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:33,754
Scott: Yeah, physically, especially if you're in a data center, because there's no way you're going to go down there.

1100
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:38,655
Scott: Yeah, dude, walk, walk, find the machine that's probably labeled with some numbers.

1101
00:54:38,937 --> 00:54:41,633
Scott: Look up in a book to figure out which numbers match up to which machine.

1102
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,570
Rym: I think that's about all.

1103
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:52,070
Rym: I mean, really, we just wanted to kind of cover memory, mostly because I want to end the stupid debate about memory usage and memory leaks and fire in browsers.

1104
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:52,814
Scott: I do want to talk.

1105
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:55,646
Scott: I do want to spend like two minutes, though, talking about how different memories work.

1106
00:54:55,768 --> 00:54:55,910
Scott: Right.

1107
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:59,490
Scott: So the registers in the CPU, those are flip flops.

1108
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,530
Scott: If you want to know what a flip flop is, look it up.

1109
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:02,583
Rym: We did a show on that.

1110
00:55:02,726 --> 00:55:02,970
Scott: We did.

1111
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:03,612
Scott: Right.

1112
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:06,430
Scott: So the memory that's in your RAM, the SDRAM.

1113
00:55:06,673 --> 00:55:06,897
Scott: Right.

1114
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:07,649
Scott: You know how that works?

1115
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,549
Rym: Yeah, actually, I took a class on that at RIT.

1116
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:11,569
Scott: So do you know how it works?

1117
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,010
Rym: Well, let's see.

1118
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:14,942
Rym: You want me to actually explain?

1119
00:55:14,962 --> 00:55:15,490
Rym: I'm trying to remember.

1120
00:55:16,032 --> 00:55:16,416
Rym: Pretty much.

1121
00:55:16,437 --> 00:55:17,550
Scott: I don't think you know how it works.

1122
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,420
Rym: Isn't it capacitative?

1123
00:55:18,765 --> 00:55:19,029
Scott: It is.

1124
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:24,490
Scott: It is a grid of capacitors, basically really tiny capacitors and a whole lot of them.

1125
00:55:24,852 --> 00:55:26,430
Scott: And the computer will charge them up.

1126
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,010
Scott: And, you know, a capacitor is like a little temporary battery.

1127
00:55:29,111 --> 00:55:31,290
Scott: So if it's holding a charge, that's a one.

1128
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,109
Scott: And if it and then it lets the charge go.

1129
00:55:33,493 --> 00:55:34,910
Scott: And now that capacitor is a zero.

1130
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,955
Scott: So it's a grid of a zillion capacitors and it can charge, it can charge them up and discharge them.

1131
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:41,810
Scott: And that is how it's ones and zeros.

1132
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:51,630
Scott: But obviously, if the computer turns off, you lose all the memory in RAM because all the capacitors empty out, just like, you know, if you turn the computer off, all the flip flops go to zero.

1133
00:55:51,810 --> 00:56:00,150
Rym: OK, because basically what I was worried is that you were going for the more specific answer about like dynamic versus static, whether or not refresh intervals.

1134
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,650
Scott: That is too advanced for these people.

1135
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:02,970
Rym: That is why I was equivocating.

1136
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:06,110
Scott: But that is also why there are security vulnerabilities.

1137
00:56:06,391 --> 00:56:06,592
Scott: Right.

1138
00:56:06,673 --> 00:56:14,650
Scott: Where you can actually turn a computer off, take the RAM stick out really quick and read the memory out of it because the capacitors don't drain instantly.

1139
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:15,412
Scott: Right.

1140
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:23,050
Scott: There were some security vulnerabilities where people were extracting hard drive encryption, disk encryption, using liquid nitrogen to cool RAM.

1141
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,570
Scott: And they would cool the RAM with liquid nitrogen, pull the stick out.

1142
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,430
Scott: The capacitors would still be holding their charge because they were so cold.

1143
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:31,730
Scott: And then they would read the memory really quickly.

1144
00:56:31,851 --> 00:56:33,050
Scott: But of course, you have physical access.

1145
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:33,917
Scott: You have everything anyway.

1146
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,670
Scott: So it's kind of it's just a fun proof of concept.

1147
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:43,290
Rym: You know, where it would be useful if people, especially, you know, a terrorist or a financial person who needed to get away with something, did our strategy.

1148
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,021
Rym: Laptop, boot CD, RAM only.

1149
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,655
Scott: Yeah.

1150
00:56:49,775 --> 00:56:51,741
Scott: There's also Biosis based.

1151
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:54,890
Scott: CMOS is basically like a circuit breaker, right?

1152
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,475
Scott: It's a whole bunch of just like the circuit breaker in your basement, only much smaller.

1153
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,090
Scott: And that's how that works.

1154
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,068
Scott: It's basically if the breakers are turned to the one way, it's zero.

1155
00:57:03,451 --> 00:57:04,507
Scott: And if they're turned the other way, it's one.

1156
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:10,610
Scott: And those right, the circuit breaker switches in your basement, they don't move around unless the fuse gets tripped.

1157
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:11,692
Scott: Right.

1158
00:57:11,712 --> 00:57:17,950
Scott: So, you know, and in a in on a bios, right, the fuse is only tripped manually.

1159
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:19,890
Scott: It's not you know, it's not hooked up to a fuse.

1160
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,990
Scott: It's hooked up to a manual flash device.

1161
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,169
Scott: So you basically you're manually controlling which way the switches go.

1162
00:57:26,992 --> 00:57:30,550
Scott: So, you know, you put something in that memory, it's there forever.

1163
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:33,130
Scott: You know, and a hard drive is a magnetic disk.

1164
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:38,530
Scott: You know, it sets the different little spots on the disk to be zero or one by turning the magnets around.

1165
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,166
Rym: Now, you might talk about a solid state disk flash memory.

1166
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,890
Rym: It's just flash memory and a hard drive form factor with better logic.

1167
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:45,371
Scott: Yep.

1168
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:46,229
Scott: That's it.

1169
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:47,430
Scott: Flash memory is weird.

1170
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,530
Rym: What about ferrite core?

1171
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,670
Scott: That's that's also a magnet.

1172
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,630
Scott: Yeah, a lot of a lot of the other kinds of memory, just magnets like tape is magnets.

1173
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:05,490
Scott: You know, there are some physical memory storage formats like abacus, abacus, you know, gears, you know, marbles and slots.

1174
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:06,753
Rym: Yeah.

1175
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:18,628
Rym: I've made a fairly complex binary computer out of marbles in slots with flip flop switches to not technically cheat, but to technically completely win a Science Olympiad competition.

1176
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,930
Scott: This physical switches, you just turn the switch left or right like a relay.

1177
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:22,412
Scott: Yeah.

1178
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:26,410
Scott: You know, there's all kinds of ways to store a zero or a one.

1179
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:34,356
Scott: But the ones in your computer are mostly flip flops, magnets, flash and grid of capacitors.

1180
00:58:34,517 --> 00:58:35,749
Scott: Those are those are the biggest ones.

1181
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,690
Rym: But really, look at your RAM usage and look at it for real.

1182
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,669
Scott: Don't look at your RAM.

1183
00:58:40,992 --> 00:58:41,748
Rym: You look at it to know.

1184
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:44,590
Rym: Make sure that you're you've got a big set of cash.

1185
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,650
Rym: Don't look for free memory.

1186
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:47,169
Rym: Look for memory that's cashed.

1187
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:50,650
Rym: And if you have none, if it's all being used legit.

1188
00:58:51,355 --> 00:58:51,518
Rym: Yeah.

1189
00:58:51,538 --> 00:58:52,109
Rym: You need more RAM.

1190
00:58:52,331 --> 00:58:58,070
Rym: And yeah, and but lack of RAM is almost never the cause of your problem.

1191
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:01,930
Scott: If you see a program using a lot of RAM, just completely ignore it.

1192
00:59:02,031 --> 00:59:03,009
Scott: I mean, dude, a big deal.

1193
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:03,987
Rym: I edit HD.

1194
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,281
Rym: I did it an hour of 1080p.

1195
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,036
Rym: And you know what?

1196
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:09,330
Rym: Six gigs of RAM was plenty.

1197
00:59:09,931 --> 00:59:10,072
Scott: Yeah.

1198
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:15,214
Scott: Unless you are running out of RAM, like your disk is thrashing, just completely ignore.

1199
00:59:15,274 --> 00:59:17,350
Scott: Who cares if Firefox is using six hundred megabytes?

1200
00:59:17,552 --> 00:59:19,470
Scott: It's only making Firefox faster.

1201
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:21,330
Scott: It's not a problem.

1202
00:59:21,676 --> 00:59:22,550
Scott: It's not an issue.

1203
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:28,610
Scott: As some other program that uses 20 megabytes is probably poorly written because it's not caching anything.

1204
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:36,290
Rym: As an aside, if you think that your browser is using way too much RAM or it's growing as a memory leak, odds are it doesn't.

1205
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:39,930
Rym: And some shitty add on that you installed is, in fact, the cause of the problem.

1206
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:42,370
Scott: That can be possible as long as your disk isn't thrashing.

1207
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,610
Scott: Just ignore how much memory is being used.

1208
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:54,292
Scott: However, one thing you should be aware of is that when using many programs at once, you might just have to close something like if you want to play a 3D game that's incredibly advanced,

1209
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:54,714
Rym: it

1210
00:59:54,794 --> 01:00:06,349
Scott: might need like two gigs plus of RAM to hold all those textures and all that other kinds of stuff, especially if your video card doesn't have enough memory to hold all the textures in it, because that's what video card memory is used for, holding textures.

1211
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:10,421
Scott: Your PCI Express or your AGP slot will.

1212
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:13,829
Scott: you will actually store some of the textures in your regular RAM.

1213
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,590
Scott: So if you you know, you might end up using tons of RAM when playing a game.

1214
01:00:18,012 --> 01:00:27,029
Scott: So maybe if you don't have a lot of RAM, maybe you only have two gigs, you know, and your video card only has half a gig, you might want to close your browser before you play a game and you'll be fine.

1215
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:32,048
Rym: And if you're buying a computer, building a computer, buying RAM, pretty much how many DIMMs do you have?

1216
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:39,541
Rym: And then look at the instruction book, put in the minimum number of DIMMs to get whatever interleaving or whatever set up is.

1217
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:40,970
Scott: some computers have dual.

1218
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:42,198
Scott: What's it called?

1219
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:42,870
Scott: Dual, whatever.

1220
01:00:42,991 --> 01:00:44,710
Scott: And some have triple like mine has triple.

1221
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,536
Rym: I have six DIMMs.

1222
01:00:45,657 --> 01:00:47,350
Rym: I got to fill at least three to have optimal.

1223
01:00:47,572 --> 01:00:47,733
Scott: Yes.

1224
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,890
Scott: He has to buy three sticks of RAM for that computer.

1225
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:56,089
Scott: My computer, you need to buy two sticks and putting them in alternating slots, pretty much get four gigs of RAM or six gigs of RAM.

1226
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,550
Scott: RAM is so cheap.

1227
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,990
Scott: There's no reason not to get a ton of it.

1228
01:00:59,171 --> 01:01:04,750
Scott: And if your computer has so even if you have a crappy net book or something, right, a RAM upgrade is ridiculously inexpensive.

1229
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:09,835
Scott: So if you are running out, let's say you have a gig of RAM in a net book and Firefox is using five hundred.

1230
01:01:10,137 --> 01:01:12,210
Scott: Well, it's not Firefox's fault for using five hundred.

1231
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:12,999
Scott: It's totally fine.

1232
01:01:13,263 --> 01:01:13,770
Scott: It's your fault.

1233
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,769
Scott: It's your fault for having one gig.

1234
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:19,791
Scott: So go and buy a two or a four gig stick and put it in that net book and it'll be so awesome.

1235
01:01:20,233 --> 01:01:28,050
Rym: There is the side topic of RAM disks, which are not as commonly used in the modern era because we have solid state disks and just because we have tons of RAM.

1236
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:28,672
Scott: That's true.

1237
01:01:29,013 --> 01:01:33,730
Rym: But there was a time I once made a RAM disk and installed Doom onto it.

1238
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:38,590
Scott: Yeah, basically what some people do, if you have so much RAM that you've got a whole bunch of extra, you don't even know what to do with it.

1239
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:40,650
Scott: Let's say my computer had 20 gigs of RAM.

1240
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,889
Scott: It's like, well, obviously I'm not even using four.

1241
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:44,511
Scott: So what the fuck am I going to do with 20?

1242
01:01:44,511 --> 01:01:46,770
Scott: Well, I could make a disk in RAM.

1243
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,131
Scott: Right.

1244
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:50,270
Scott: So the computer treats, thinks it has a new hard disk like E colon.

1245
01:01:50,712 --> 01:01:52,589
Scott: But really, it's RAM that's being used.

1246
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:53,313
Scott: Right.

1247
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:56,370
Scott: Which means when the computer turns off, that disk is going to be erased.

1248
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,570
Rym: So I installed Firefox there.

1249
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:03,530
Scott: I can install a program into that RAM and now that program will load extremely quickly.

1250
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:09,770
Rym: So on boot, let's say I have a program that gets installed into this drive and runs.

1251
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:10,476
Rym: It doesn't know.

1252
01:02:10,496 --> 01:02:12,030
Rym: You don't have to do anything special in the program.

1253
01:02:12,554 --> 01:02:14,170
Rym: And yet you'll get crazy performance.

1254
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,270
Rym: It's just completely volatile.

1255
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:24,474
Scott: Or if you're working, you're editing a video or if you're editing a very large Photoshop file, right, you could save it into that RAM disk and then it'll be very quick to save and load that file.

1256
01:02:24,535 --> 01:02:26,990
Scott: As long as the computer doesn't turn off or what, it'll be safe.

1257
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,848
Scott: And then what you could do is you would copy that file to your actual regular disk.

1258
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:34,510
Scott: that's safe every once in a while so that you don't lose your information.

1259
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:39,971
Rym: My current computer, I put the operating system windows on a 32 gigabyte solid state drive.

1260
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:40,333
Scott: Yep.

1261
01:02:40,694 --> 01:02:44,993
Rym: And everything else is I'm slow as seventy two hundred RPM, a half terabyte drive.

1262
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:47,370
Scott: And as a result, the computer boots very, very quickly.

1263
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,830
Rym: My computer boots faster than I'm trying to think of something.

1264
01:02:52,012 --> 01:02:52,729
Rym: It's like 10 seconds.

1265
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:53,574
Scott: Yeah, it's really fast.

1266
01:02:53,654 --> 01:03:01,769
Scott: And, you know, many common operations, because the most commonly accessed files, the operating system files in the windows folder, it's going to are going to happen very, very quickly.

1267
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:07,372
Scott: But all the things that you don't do so often, like how often do you open up a game once a day?

1268
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:13,264
Rym: Not even that, like most of my media is on the NAS over the network on the gigabit ethernet because I don't.

1269
01:03:14,032 --> 01:03:15,570
Scott: But it's gigabit ethernet is pretty fast.

1270
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:15,911
Scott: It is.

1271
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:18,510
Scott: I mean, a serial ATA drive is three gigabit per second.

1272
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,710
Scott: So gigabit ethernet is one.

1273
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,813
Rym: We could stream stuff off of our computers upstairs and that hundred megabit and it was fine.

1274
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:26,210
Scott: You should see me streaming over my gigabit at home.

1275
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,570
Scott: Right.

1276
01:03:26,771 --> 01:03:33,749
Scott: It's it's one gigabit is fast enough to get filed music and video files, you know, maybe not fast enough to run a counter strike.

1277
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:35,849
Scott: You don't want to stall counter strike on the NAS.

1278
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:36,310
Scott: That's stupid.

1279
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:44,680
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1280
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:49,983
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1281
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:55,219
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1282
01:03:55,580 --> 01:04:02,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1283
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,416

1284
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,679
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1285
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,840
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
