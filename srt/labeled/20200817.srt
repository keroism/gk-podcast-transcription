00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,750
Rym: It's Monday, August 17th, 2020.

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,231
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,119
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,428
Rym: tonight We have an update from 2007.

5
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:22,019
Rym: We are revisiting the topic of removable media.

6
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:24,557
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,388 --> 00:00:31,532
Rym: so, uh Yesterday like I do every weekend.

8
00:00:31,673 --> 00:00:45,660
Rym: I ran a half marathon and At one point I was near the RFK bridge like coming over the bridge back from Randall's Island like 10 miles into this run Feeling great like going faster than usual cuz it's cool out and there's a cop car sitting there.

9
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:54,300
Rym: So I yell defund the police and black lives matter at this cop car And they yell something at me and then I flip them off because they're being weird and I keep running.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,540
Rym: They do a screeching u-turn and start following me slowly.

11
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:05,060
Rym: Yeah, so I just I turn and I just keep running and I run up a one-way street and they can't follow me.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,283
Rym: That's the end of that.

13
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:23,359
Rym: then I'm on the I'm based on Vernon Boulevard like in the homestretch like my last mile and A cop car which I now realize is the same cop car Pulls into the bike lane behind me and follows me for like a mile very slowly and they keep doing their siren a little bit.

14
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:24,957
Scott: What what what?

15
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,402
Scott: Yeah, they love that.

16
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:29,534
Rym: Yep, and then they start yelling at me out the window.

17
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:30,337
Rym: Hey fuck.

18
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:31,140
Rym: Oh, what's your problem?

19
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,368
Rym: Is the exact words they said?

20
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,180
Rym: they kept kept yelling it.

21
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:38,840
Rym: So I stopped away from them and the guys like come here and I'm like, am I free to leave?

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,083
Rym: Am I free to leave?

23
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:40,886
Rym: I did the whole.

24
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:42,112
Rym: am I being detained?

25
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:43,337
Rym: Am I being detained?

26
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:44,040
Rym: Am I free to leave?

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,782
Rym: Am I free to leave?

28
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:49,939
Scott: So it's so annoying that like that is simultaneously right the right thing to do.

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,448
Scott: Well, it's also a thing that assholes.

30
00:01:53,528 --> 00:01:55,272
Rym: It's also a thing that sob sits to.

31
00:01:55,793 --> 00:02:05,358
Scott: it's like I learned that you know Correct thing to do from like shitty white libertarian assholes, right and it's like, ah, so it's like.

32
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,657
Scott: it's so dirty But it's also the right thing to do in the US and the United States.

33
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,374
Rym: So Eventually, they finally are like yes, you're free to leave.

34
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:16,759
Rym: so I'd start running again.

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:28,159
Rym: They waited in the bike lane for a while and then gun their engine and charged me with the car swerved away at the last Second and splashed me with a giant wave of water and then they sped off down the street ran a red light and turned left.

36
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,288
Scott: Yeah, that's what cops do.

37
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,560
Rym: So I called 9-1-1 and I learned some things.

38
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:42,250
Rym: So one in New York, if you call 9-1-1 New York City or New York City on the police They go into a different mode.

39
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:44,700
Rym: They do not forward it to the police.

40
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:50,639
Scott: They forward a mode a different mode where they write your name down in the book So that I'm sure my name is in a book somewhere now.

41
00:02:50,882 --> 00:03:04,458
Rym: but instead the the 9-1-1 operator got like really worried and like called someone else into the conference call from the internal affairs division and got a detective on the line with me and basically a cop.

42
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:08,693
Rym: This is a cop in IAV like a different share.

43
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:09,917
Rym: She was kind of awesome.

44
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,939
Rym: She Basically, I described what happened ending to be awesome.

45
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,560
Scott: She was like she's like who exactly do I need to high-five later?

46
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:29,922
Rym: No, she actually took my formal complaint and I will have the likely Privilege of testifying against these two cops at a later date in an internal hearing Uh-huh.

47
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:36,140
Rym: So yeah, because basically very surprised if that anything comes about say so basically what was interesting is one.

48
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:43,750
Rym: they thought they put me on hold at one point and They had a conversation where they was clear.

49
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,955
Rym: They did not think I could hear them.

50
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:55,360
Rym: Mm-hmm The detective lady who sounded like a black woman Was basically she was saying things to the effect of this shit again.

51
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:56,905
Rym: Who who what can?

52
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:57,869
Rym: what cars were in that area?

53
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:59,495
Rym: what cars were in that area?

54
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:01,000
Rym: There are only two cars in the story.

55
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,100
Rym: I want to know which one of them was on the story of Boulevard and Vernon Boulevard and she was like she was mad.

56
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:14,560
Rym: And then then there's like that there's and also the 9-1 operator was like, oh, yeah I got the call for this and they exchange all these codes and it was a long conversation.

57
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:18,178
Rym: Then like she's like, okay I'm gonna get this guy back out and then it cuts back to.

58
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,580
Rym: They get quiet and then they call me back in and they're very like professional and like normal again, and that was really funny.

59
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,686
Rym: I wish I could I wish I could have recorded that but it was a 911 calls and my phone was like in that weird No one calls her a public.

60
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:33,175
Rym: Yeah, so I could do an f.o.i.a.

61
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:34,400
Rym: And get the audio of this.

62
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:45,189
Scott: Yeah, if you should because otherwise I'm piling a whole salt cellar full of salt and any Rym stories like no That that part happened pretty straight up.

63
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:52,891
Rym: and what then when detective got back on what she basically said to me was Asking if I'm being detained was the right thing to do.

64
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:58,388
Rym: That's the only reason I probably have a case Mmm, because it's like.

65
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:00,279
Scott: I said, it's the right thing to do, but it's also that.

66
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:04,000
Rym: And then she was like did they give you did you give you an opportunity?

67
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,385
Rym: To ask for their badge number?

68
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:08,518
Rym: after they said you were free to leave and I said no they immediately left.

69
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:11,038
Rym: and then she was Like that is the second part.

70
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:14,380
Rym: We'll get back to you so we'll see what happens.

71
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,488
Scott: I mean, it's not illegal to just yell at cops.

72
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:28,109
Rym: Nope, exactly, but it is according to that detective lady assault to splash someone on purpose with your car Really?

73
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:30,849
Rym: Yeah That is technically.

74
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,860
Scott: you prove that they splashed you with their car.

75
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:35,512
Rym: I will see because there were some way.

76
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,300
Scott: how much how much were you splashed?

77
00:05:38,263 --> 00:05:42,436
Rym: So they backed up and they gunned it through the bike lane at high and they're half.

78
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,780
Scott: there happened to be a puddle thing.

79
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:45,088
Rym: Oh, it was during that rainstorm.

80
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,580
Rym: I was running after that giant rainstorm Sunday.

81
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:50,906
Rym: It was like a god.

82
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:55,470
Rym: it was to the point that I got a guy who was running like further back Stopped and were like, holy shit.

83
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,153
Rym: Are you okay?

84
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,360
Rym: I actually got his details.

85
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,327
Rym: He was a witness and I gave those details to the cop.

86
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,431
Scott: Uh-huh.

87
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:02,036
Rym: So all that was.

88
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,060
Rym: that was a fun Sunday.

89
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,607
Rym: So then I just finished my run and went home like normal.

90
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:10,180
Scott: All right, I biked over the the Tappan Zee Bridge again.

91
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,869
Rym: We're thinking about doing that this coming weekend.

92
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,478
Rym: We're gonna go up in the up Jersey down New York.

93
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,020
Rym: seems like they're right.

94
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,679
Scott: Well, that's well, that's what I did.

95
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:20,205
Scott: And so there were.

96
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,470
Scott: there were two problems, right?

97
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,052
Scott: It's a problem.

98
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:24,120
Scott: One is the route that I used.

99
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:28,279
Scott: I was not aware of this one Hill, but I got to.

100
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:37,416
Scott: You know Elevation wise the hill was you know, it was the tallest hill of the ride But it wasn't that much taller than the first big hill and it wasn't.

101
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:40,174
Scott: you know The elevation of the first hill was not a problem.

102
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:44,060
Scott: Yeah The problem was the steepness of the second Hill.

103
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,196
Scott: It was like I look at it and it's like looks like it's straight up Google Street View.

104
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:53,540
Scott: It doesn't look as scary And the straight up part wasn't actually that long.

105
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:57,379
Scott: It was like this the hill just starts with a straight-up part, right?

106
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:09,107
Scott: Like it starts with a straight-up part and that straight-up part was just too steep And I had to like walk that tiny little straight-up part and then I went week a week a week a week on the rest Of the hill, you know, no problem.

107
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,946
Rym: So actually the previous weekend right after the hurricane We went up this.

108
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:13,400
Rym: we went up from Van Cortlandt Park.

109
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:18,180
Rym: We went past that fence that everyone tore down and took the South County Trailway extension like all the way north.

110
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:19,184
Scott: How did you get?

111
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:19,948
Scott: I couldn't get through.

112
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:20,651
Scott: so here's the thing.

113
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:20,972
Rym: It's open.

114
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:22,157
Rym: So people just cut the fence.

115
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:22,679
Rym: It's just open.

116
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:24,009
Scott: No, no, no, no.

117
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,384
Scott: No, so on the way back Right my way back.

118
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:33,384
Scott: I was coming down the county trail where the trees still blocking it and I can't know There's no trees.

119
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,060
Scott: There was at least one chainsaw it up, you know cleaned away tree during the part.

120
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:38,586
Rym: That's the part that's technically open.

121
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:42,159
Rym: All right, they did not clean up any trees and the part that's technically closed.

122
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:51,739
Scott: Anyway, so I point is I was coming down south and I get to the end of the county trail way to where the Putnam Trail Begins and there's that little fence there, right?

123
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:56,398
Scott: No, there was like a mega fence completely surrounding it on all sides and I couldn't get around.

124
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:56,920
Rym: there's a path.

125
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:57,989
Rym: I've seen that fence.

126
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:58,654
Rym: I have pictures of it.

127
00:07:58,694 --> 00:07:59,299
Rym: not to the right.

128
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,104
Rym: There's a path.

129
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,378
Rym: people have cut a hole in the fence and marked it.

130
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:04,948
Scott: I could not see any way through.

131
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:07,075
Rym: we've gone through that hole multiple times.

132
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:12,100
Rym: In fact, right there in the north You'll see a bunch of other people also using this path.

133
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:16,080
Scott: I was on the north side trying to get through the fence and I couldn't get through.

134
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,931
Rym: It's a. you have to walk like two or three minutes like out of your way But there's a little path that goes around that fence that people keep.

135
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:23,820
Rym: every time they patch it up people cut it again.

136
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,846
Rym: I've used it many times.

137
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:26,374
Scott: I couldn't get through the fence.

138
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:27,360
Scott: I tried anyway.

139
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,407
Rym: That is definitely open.

140
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:31,680
Scott: It was a hundred percent sealed fence.

141
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,614
Rym: It was definitely not so.

142
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:47,000
Rym: but if you got in there The one thing you order it into is there are five Separate trees that are huge and are blocking the path so bad that you'll have to like Climb up on top of the tree like get someone to hand your bike up to you toss your bike down the other side.

143
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:59,579
Scott: Anyway, that would have been better than what I had to do Which is go way around like on some weird roads like on a fence But there's like me but like on the edge of the park between the highway and I know where that is.

144
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,605
Rym: I know that bullshit.

145
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:03,200
Rym: you can kind of get to the motion Lou, but not quite.

146
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:05,811
Scott: They eventually got to the marshal.

147
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:06,375
Scott: then I was fine.

148
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:10,145
Rym: Yeah, but you're like Trail for a while.

149
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:15,383
Scott: getting from getting from that fence to the marshal ooh without being able to go through the fence was Shité.

150
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:21,064
Rym: I'm pretty sure I have a Strava of me doing that one time with Emily before we learned the gnosis of Just go around the fence.

151
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:21,646
Rym: There's a path.

152
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,352
Scott: I couldn't get through the fence.

153
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,529
Scott: Yeah, that fence will be down soon enough though They finished the paving.

154
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,668
Rym: it looks like uh, no They're the paving was not done because we've.

155
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,420
Rym: we rode that whole path the weekend before you took your ride.

156
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,019
Rym: They did finish the bridges.

157
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,857
Rym: But there's a lot more paving work that has to be done and it's filled with this.

158
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:39,560
Rym: sound trees.

159
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:42,249
Scott: There's still mud action going on there.

160
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,188
Rym: you have to walk through the mud a few times to get around Other fences they've put up and to get

161
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:55,920
Scott: just literally like put literally any other way to get her like a legit way Just like make a temporary detour of some kind so that you can get from there.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,353
Scott: It's like just somewhere else in the park, but it's like no from that fence.

163
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:05,335
Scott: if you don't break through the fence there's literally nothing to do besides hike in the woods and get muddy.

164
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:10,475
Scott: one time is a Temporary path of some kind to the to the West we go.

165
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:11,720
Rym: we took the secret path.

166
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:13,660
Rym: We biked all the way south and we got to the bottom.

167
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:16,456
Rym: There's a big fence blocking the entrance to VanCotland Park.

168
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,120
Rym: So we were trapped.

169
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:23,195
Rym: We were ready to go all the way back up and around From like the end of the way at the bot at the bottom near the golf course entrance.

170
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:24,680
Scott: There's also big mega fence.

171
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,554
Rym: Yeah, so we we got there at a time when the fence was in place and you know what.

172
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:34,979
Rym: there was there two other bikers One of whom had some wire cutters and he was literally snipping the fence one by one.

173
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:38,757
Rym: Yeah, he caught a big hole in the fence, but it was taking him a while.

174
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:39,360
Rym: So we went back.

175
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:47,119
Rym: There's a secret path to the right over there Like hundred yards before the dead end and if you go right you can get into the golf course and around and get back out.

176
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,586
Scott: Mmm, it's still annoying.

177
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:52,720
Rym: I know all the secret paths to use that bootleg bike path.

178
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:55,428
Scott: It's not how it's supposed to be legit.

179
00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:56,291
Rym: It's not done yet.

180
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:57,215
Rym: So it's bootleg.

181
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:58,320
Scott: It should be done.

182
00:10:58,581 --> 00:10:59,766
Scott: What's taking us all over it?

183
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:00,972
Rym: I think is the reason it's not done.

184
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,620
Scott: No, it just gives you know, they've been working.

185
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,524
Scott: They've not been work.

186
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:07,720
Scott: you see I think is if cove is your excuse they should have made zero progress on it, right?

187
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,693
Scott: But they've actually made a ton of progress on it.

188
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:10,600
Scott: Someone's working on it.

189
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,960
Scott: Well, if you think it's safe enough to work on it, then it's safe enough to finish it, right?

190
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,744
Rym: I think you're just taking them a while because there's less people Distributed.

191
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:19,776
Scott: I wouldn't I wouldn't complain if they had done no work on it.

192
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:22,431
Scott: I'd be like, oh that's understandable They've done no work on this clearly.

193
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:23,780
Scott: It's not safe to come out here work.

194
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:24,643
Rym: Oh, I can.

195
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:34,748
Rym: actually I can shows I could share something about that because what I noticed was every time we use that path There was more progress until the hurricane Once all the trees were down like like there's.

196
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,099
Rym: you should see I got some pictures of these fucking trees that are down across that thing.

197
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:43,253
Rym: They no one is available to chainsaw up those trees.

198
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,480
Scott: They're only chainsaw trees on the county trail.

199
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,239
Rym: They only chainsaw trees and public trails not in not yet open trails.

200
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:53,519
Rym: They prioritize because there aren't that many people who can go change all those trees.

201
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:57,736
Rym: Anyway, anyway, that's our bike nights is back guys.

202
00:11:57,776 --> 00:11:58,480
Rym: That's the story.

203
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:03,360
Scott: And more bike nights news, I got the the fancy bike trainers.

204
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:04,444
Rym: Oh, how is it?

205
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:05,809
Rym: Cuz we got to get something before.

206
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,435
Rym: I feel like late fall.

207
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:08,880
Rym: Everyone's gonna buy bike trainers.

208
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,683
Rym: They're all gonna be sold out.

209
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:12,033
Scott: I mean, it's not here yet, but you should definitely.

210
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:13,379
Scott: I already know that it's the best one.

211
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,808
Scott: The point is I'm gonna get some Zwift action going on.

212
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,497
Scott: So look for some Zwift streaming.

213
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:32,306
Scott: if you don't know what Google for zwift As the alt, you know, you're down the bike road if you're doing Zwift All Right, so I guess it's Monday.

214
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:33,210
Rym: we should I go out some news.

215
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,120
Rym: there is pretty much like the biggest news.

216
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:36,792
Rym: This is the biggest news in gaming.

217
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:45,805
Rym: It's also Some of the biggest news in tech because of the escalation that has occurred not just would have been big news anyway But because of the escalation this is more.

218
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:55,140
Scott: Yeah, so we recently talked about the antitrust hearing in the house how it's one of the best Hearings we've seen recently, you know, there's some you know, some good ones in the past.

219
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:56,544
Scott: There's also a good one, right.

220
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:57,366
Scott: and how?

221
00:12:57,507 --> 00:13:04,238
Scott: Apple, you know Apple in terms of antitrust is a lot less to complain about than say Google or Facebook, right?

222
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:10,820
Scott: Or right, but there's still with something to complain about which is mostly the App Store, right?

223
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:16,120
Scott: In that yeah, they charge if you have a store an app in the App Store, right?

224
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:29,046
Scott: First of all, you cannot get your app onto Apple's App Store unless Apple approves Yep, and secondly if you do put an app in Apple's App Store They make you you know Do things like use Apple login.

225
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:44,179
Scott: or especially the biggest one is if you want to collect money from your customers in your app let's say you know your Amazon and you have a Kindle app and you want to sell books or Your Rym and you want to you make a special podcast app and you want to sell podcasts.

226
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:44,982
Scott: now Right.

227
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:51,106
Scott: or you make a video game and you put it in the App Store and you want to sell gambling All of that money.

228
00:13:51,126 --> 00:14:00,528
Scott: if people spend the money directly in the app You can make people go to like your website to spend the money and therefore in the app There is no way to spend money.

229
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:14,548
Scott: The Apple is okay with that But if you want people to give you money directly in the app, you must do it the Apple way right and You Apple takes a 30% cut.

230
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:18,420
Scott: They also take a 30% cut of the price of your app itself.

231
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:24,628
Scott: So if your game that you're selling in the App Store is 20 bucks What's 30% of 20 bucks like now?

232
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:32,780
Rym: on one hand one could argue that Apple does not have a novelty 75 but Apple does not have a monopoly on smartphones.

233
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:40,220
Rym: So this like the only monopoly here ostensibly is that Apple has a boutique device?

234
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:43,020
Rym: That is not even the majority device in this space.

235
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:49,560
Rym: And if you use their boutique device, you're beholden to their weird rules in their closed walled garden ecosystem.

236
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:56,127
Rym: Like if you don't like it, you could go to Android Could be made.

237
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:58,458
Scott: that is the argument that Apple makes.

238
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:08,388
Rym: indeed Yeah, and it's kind of a fair argument because Apple is not even the majority market share compared to Android for a lot of reasons Right, but it's funny how it's like Apple.

239
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,600
Scott: It's like when you see an Apple keynote app, right and they're reporting all like their numbers.

240
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,073
Scott: They're like look at how many phones we sold.

241
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:16,300
Scott: Look how much share we have.

242
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,263
Scott: Look how great we are.

243
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:24,489
Scott: big big numbers and that the antitrust hearing they're like, oh, no, we we're so small We didn't sell the most phones.

244
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,660
Scott: We we don't have the most market share.

245
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:31,455
Scott: It's like which one is it bro, which one is it Tim Apple?

246
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:32,259
Scott: are you big or small?

247
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:34,362
Scott: Make up your mind.

248
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,467
Rym: I'm looking for good numbers.

249
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:39,072
Rym: They're actually weirdly hard to find in a cursory Google.

250
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:45,457
Scott: I Was measuring in different, you know metrics.

251
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:45,840
Rym: I saw it.

252
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,844
Rym: I just did one Google.

253
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:51,949
Rym: one said Android 75% iOS 25% and another one said Android 51%.

254
00:15:51,949 --> 00:16:00,495
Scott: so Yep, exactly You have to pay like a you know, some sort of group to get numbers.

255
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:01,578
Scott: You can maybe trust.

256
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:12,920
Rym: Yeah So but all this aside, so yeah Apple Basically kicked well, so really epic games with fortnight played a game with Apple.

257
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:24,059
Rym: They seem to try to get Apple to kick them out to then trigger this lawsuit and they seem to have Follow-up responses prepared for the things Apple was likely to do.

258
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:25,507
Rym: Mm-hmm.

259
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:26,698
Rym: That's the big news.

260
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:30,075
Scott: So it seems like what happened.

261
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:31,925
Scott: is You know epic?

262
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:36,241
Scott: who makes fortnight and the epic game store and such things Right.

263
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:42,360
Scott: They were like, alright, we're tired of Apple taking a 30% cut of all our fortnight monies for our mobile app.

264
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,713
Scott: Right and Google taking a cut of all our monies, you know, whatever.

265
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,781
Scott: so, you know What?

266
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:52,540
Scott: if we you know put in our app right away to for people to pay us directly?

267
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:54,869
Scott: It's like well, it wouldn't get approved in the App Store.

268
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,271
Scott: Uh-huh.

269
00:16:55,351 --> 00:17:01,253
Scott: Well, here's we can get around that We'll make our app so we can update it, you know what.

270
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:05,900
Scott: so that we don't have to push out an App Store update We'll make like, you know, we'll do a back-end push, right?

271
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:16,656
Scott: We'll run the shop part off the back end and that way we can surprise and put that in our game In our app without having to push an App Store update and get approval.

272
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:19,446
Scott: and they're like, alright Well, then Apple's just gonna kick us out of the store.

273
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:20,130
Scott: What do we do then?

274
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,279
Scott: Ah, then we'll sue them.

275
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:37,129
Scott: Yeah But then Apple will take away all our developer access and we won't even be able to Continue because there are other people who are making apps for the App Store that are approved and totally legit Using the Unreal Engine.

276
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:44,871
Scott: we have a whole team of people working on the Unreal Engine Right and making sure that the Unreal Engine can build iOS apps.

277
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:48,140
Rym: the Unreal Engine remember is run by epic games.

278
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:49,123
Scott: That's right.

279
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:50,607
Scott: So you're an independent developer.

280
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,332
Scott: you pay or for free.

281
00:17:52,532 --> 00:18:02,280
Scott: use the Unreal Engine to make iOS games Right or make a game that's multi-platform including iOS and you want your game to be approved in the App Store, right?

282
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,387
Scott: So you use Unreal Engine you make a game.

283
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,878
Scott: Let's say we made GeekNights the game using the Unreal Engine.

284
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:24,399
Scott: Okay well, there's people at epic working on the Unreal Engine and They need Apple development kits so that they can make sure the Unreal Engine works, you know and Builds iOS apps properly so that all the other people using Unreal Engine to make iOS apps right are gonna be okay.

285
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:27,100
Scott: If they lose all our developer access.

286
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:47,411
Scott: Well, then that means that whole team of people who work on the iOS aspects of Unreal Engine Can't work because all their Apple development kits stop working and they will not be able to update the unreal tournament developer the Unreal Engine development kits To people who are developing iOS apps with that engine.

287
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:58,680
Rym: So a fundamental question here is gonna come down to Can Apple Take these kinds of actions against their like boutique market share in their web garden or not, right?

288
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:09,860
Scott: so epic saw all these things in advance and rather than have their lawyers like Scramble overnight to respond to each thing that Apple or Google would do right in response to them.

289
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:12,848
Scott: They prepared all the things in advance.

290
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:14,674
Scott: We're assuming though, right?

291
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:15,797
Scott: They definitely did.

292
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:18,489
Rym: you can just tell yeah We don't have any special knowledge here.

293
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,620
Scott: I have not proven that they have done this.

294
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,267
Rym: Also, we're not lawyers and we're not right legal advice.

295
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:29,826
Scott: I'd ever seen lawyers in my whole life prepare responses this quickly to things Yeah, they could be overworking the lawyers.

296
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,450
Scott: I guess that's a possibility, right?

297
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:31,891
Scott: But it's like.

298
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:32,774
Scott: basically.

299
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,920
Scott: it's like you're seeing responses like BAM.

300
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:36,173
Scott: It's like yeah, I don't.

301
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:37,463
Rym: well So either.

302
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:45,360
Scott: hey, they've set everything up and they said okay, they do this we do that They did this we do that we and they're moving things around laws and one of yours to the hospital.

303
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,926
Rym: You sent an answer the morgue.

304
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:47,669
Scott: That's right.

305
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,532
Scott: That's how they're doing it.

306
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:55,400
Rym: So what I have in front of me right now is Epic has filed for basically an injunction or like a restraining order.

307
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:08,018
Rym: They're basically saying we need an immediate remedy to the fact that Apple is cutting the Unreal Engine off From the Apple Store like they're filing a pro like a motion here and the preliminary statement in this injunction is really funny.

308
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:20,738
Rym: quote Just over two weeks ago Apple's CEO Tim Cook was asked during a congressional hearing whether Apple is quote ever Retaliated against or disadvantaged a developer who went public about their frustrations with the App Store.

309
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,003
Rym: Mr Cook testified.

310
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:22,565
Rym: quote.

311
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:24,754
Rym: we do not retaliate or bully people.

312
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:26,440
Rym: It's strongly against our company culture.

313
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,131
Scott: But I didn't say that I heard him say that live.

314
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:35,214
Rym: but Apple has John Just that and then it goes in like it uses the word ferociously.

315
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,799
Rym: It's it's a pretty good.

316
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:38,945
Scott: Yeah, they're basically coming.

317
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:49,840
Scott: so not only are they they're going to court not only to argue that Apple is violating antitrust law with their App Store policy, but also that Tim Cook is guilty of perjury.

318
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:55,556
Rym: But at the same time, I don't know how I want this lawsuit to go.

319
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:56,840
Scott: Yeah, it's bad.

320
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:08,867
Scott: I mean on the one hand it's like I don't like, you know, it's like we might sound like we're saying Yeah, if they go after them, but it's like I am because Apple should be broken up and should yes As powerful as it is epic also bad.

321
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:09,629
Scott: This is like.

322
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:14,100
Scott: this is not a situation where it's like I'm rooting for either side.

323
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,835
Scott: I'm rooting for certain outcomes.

324
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:24,091
Rym: Yeah I would like an outcome where App Store is above a certain line on any platform Have to allow third parties and cannot prevent.

325
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,120
Scott: I would like the court to say yeah Apple.

326
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,831
Scott: You must let anyone side load apps on to my iOS.

327
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:30,633
Scott: You can't right.

328
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:37,643
Rym: Yeah, that would be fine with me Even if Apple could still keep their 30% cut of the store Right.

329
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:46,416
Scott: I'm saying it's like if you have a platform that is or a market or something that is too big you must allow You know people to sell on the thing, you know, too bad.

330
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:54,780
Scott: Yeah You know if users want to compromise their own security right and their own stability of their own devices that's on them.

331
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:55,502
Scott: That's.

332
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:57,187
Scott: I'm okay with that right now.

333
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:01,720
Rym: Google has also now banned fortnight from their App Store.

334
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:07,210
Rym: I don't think that one's moving as quickly Like there aren't as many rapid developments as there are in the different.

335
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:14,560
Scott: the key difference there is like okay at fortnight Epic doesn't want to let Google take a cut right of the of the money.

336
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:20,780
Scott: But you can still get fortnight on Android by side loading or installing some other store or some shit.

337
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,819
Scott: It's just can't get it in the Google store where that you would have to get quote.

338
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:25,968
Rym: Well fortnight remains available on Android.

339
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:28,680
Rym: we can no longer make it available on play because it violates our policies.

340
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:34,177
Rym: Yep Exactly now Google apparently also said they're open to discussing the issue with epic games.

341
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:35,803
Scott: So Right.

342
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:36,846
Scott: Well, that's another thing right?

343
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:44,629
Scott: So on the one hand right for all of Apple's shitty policies Right for the most part, right?

344
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,399
Scott: They have actually, you know in the past they've been guilty of not doing this.

345
00:22:48,841 --> 00:23:02,360
Scott: You know, I can name some instances like involving Spotify and Apple watches but as of now Right Apple if you submit an app to the App Store it goes through the same process as even.

346
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:03,223
Scott: You know.

347
00:23:03,363 --> 00:23:04,607
Scott: Apple said this during the hearing.

348
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:08,760
Scott: and it is true as of now that even Apple's own apps, right?

349
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,659
Scott: It's like the calculator app go through the same approval process, right?

350
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:17,800
Scott: But of course that doesn't include taking a 30% cut because they get a cut of their own shit.

351
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:20,239
Scott: Also their own also their own apps are free.

352
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:23,110
Rym: now I'm pretty sure that 30% cut is one of the like.

353
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:28,533
Rym: that is probably crucial to Apple's business plan And I don't think Apple is even the same company without that cut.

354
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:29,959
Scott: No, not at all.

355
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:32,711
Rym: But yeah, all big companies.

356
00:23:32,752 --> 00:23:37,288
Scott: So right, of course But you're you can anything that you could do.

357
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:42,825
Scott: when you're developing an iOS app Apple could do and Apple is not Doing anything more.

358
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:47,900
Scott: they're not using like unpub you know API's that you're not allowed to use or whatever they have in the past.

359
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:51,936
Scott: Yeah, as of now they are not supposedly right?

360
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:53,040
Scott: There's the same requirements.

361
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,568
Scott: But you look at Google.

362
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:56,660
Scott: I say oh Google's willing to like negotiate here.

363
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,540
Scott: It's like okay, but that means that Google is holding different people different standards, right?

364
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:12,632
Scott: It's good Like oh you're gonna negotiate with epic and let them get away with something on the Google Play Store and get a special deal That a small-time developer can't get right can't get that deal.

365
00:24:12,672 --> 00:24:13,655
Scott: I'm just a small time.

366
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:15,520
Scott: I'm not big and I'm not fortnight.

367
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:16,904
Scott: Yeah, that's also bull.

368
00:24:16,944 --> 00:24:18,648
Scott: That's also bullshit right.

369
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:27,693
Rym: quote left unchecked Apple's actions where it will irreparably damage epic's reputation Among fortnight users will be catastrophic for the future of the separate Unreal Engine business.

370
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:32,770
Rym: if the Unreal Engine can no longer support Apple platforms The software developers that use it will be forced to use alternative.

371
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:39,129
Rym: the damage to your legal ease after that Point is the damage will be unquantifiable and irreparable.

372
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,355
Rym: That's something you see in this kind of lawsuit.

373
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,040
Rym: a lot that language, right?

374
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:50,644
Scott: So the point is you look at like two different monopolies the Google and the apples, right and even the epic to some extent Right, they're not monopoly.

375
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:56,040
Scott: They're just too big right and it's like yeah, they all do different things and all those things are bad.

376
00:24:56,602 --> 00:24:58,047
Scott: There's no there's no good thing.

377
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,235
Scott: It's not like oh, they're doing something different.

378
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:00,597
Scott: Therefore.

379
00:25:00,637 --> 00:25:01,038
Scott: They're good.

380
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,657
Scott: It's like no They're just bad at a different way.

381
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,129
Rym: Of course, they are in other avenues like with steam.

382
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,831
Rym: They're challenging.

383
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:09,619
Rym: steam's like absolute hegemony of online stores.

384
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:15,259
Rym: pretty well Yeah, steam also bad taking a big ol cut but as a consumer, I only want to go to one place.

385
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:20,092
Rym: That's right, that's all the conflicting motivations of people.

386
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:21,557
Scott: that's Amazon's big thing.

387
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:22,440
Scott: It's like Oh Amazon.

388
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,171
Scott: Yeah, Amazon fucks everyone over except for their customer.

389
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:27,340
Scott: Yeah, and that's why you keep buying shit on Amazon.

390
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:31,456
Scott: Well one day and the next day you're like this break up Amazon.

391
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:32,460
Scott: They're big even monopoly.

392
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:42,416
Rym: I try to buy science on non Amazon platforms when I can but oftentimes I can't and I'm basically willing to do anything before I will go to a physical store even before COVID.

393
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:43,580
Rym: I just hate going to physical stores.

394
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,183
Rym: That's all I want.

395
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:44,988
Scott: build my stuff.

396
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:45,490
Scott: I was just.

397
00:25:45,993 --> 00:25:47,300
Scott: I was just looking to buy a bike helmet.

398
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:49,408
Scott: Right because my helmet is it died again.

399
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:49,729
Scott: Yep.

400
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:56,640
Scott: I couldn't replace the fuzz again for like the third time And it's like the bike shop was too crowded.

401
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,008
Scott: Yeah, and the bike shops do?

402
00:25:59,028 --> 00:25:59,932
Scott: they have the helmet I want.

403
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:02,119
Scott: do they have it in the color and size that I want?

404
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,300
Scott: that?

405
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,510
Scott: Hasn't been you know touched by anyone's covid miss, right?

406
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:08,820
Scott: It's like well, I guess I gotta buy one online direct for the manufacturer.

407
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,220
Scott: Sorry local bike shop, right?

408
00:26:10,722 --> 00:26:18,204
Scott: Have an amazing selection of helmets even in non-covid time, honestly, I pretty much like lately Anything any technology.

409
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:20,050
Rym: I always buy directly from the manufacturer.

410
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:23,558
Rym: if that is an option and if that's not an option that I buy it from Amazon.

411
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:25,424
Scott: Yeah, you know what you can do.

412
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:34,004
Rym: but that's like big technology stuff partly because of the the scammers I keep running into on Amazon buying technology All right.

413
00:26:34,104 --> 00:26:36,035
Scott: Well, we managed to kill the whole news with one news.

414
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:37,909
Scott: So yeah move on You might skip the other ones.

415
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,104
Rym: you probably don't care about that Secure boot grub outage yet.

416
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:42,828
Rym: Not you know that problem.

417
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:49,005
Rym: So just get right into things of the day.

418
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:58,400
Rym: so, uh, we live in Queens, uh There are things that I love about living in the city that I don't get to do right now because of the quarantine.

419
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,411
Rym: So we've stumbled onto this YouTube channel and it seems like it's just like Compilations like it gets a bunch of videos from all the internet like makes a compilation.

420
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:12,160
Rym: but the compilation series that they're making Really just hit me right in the nostalgic kidney.

421
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:16,420
Rym: It's called only in New York and their kids are still making them even during the quarantine.

422
00:27:16,822 --> 00:27:25,414
Rym: It's just here are random like five or six second clips of video From all over New York City and it's basically if you watch one of these.

423
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:25,976
Rym: I'll link to one.

424
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:26,920
Rym: They're like ten minutes long.

425
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:28,343
Rym: It's just.

426
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:29,849
Rym: this is why I live in New York.

427
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,400
Rym: It's like here's someone with a cute dog on the subway.

428
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:36,595
Rym: Here's someone riding a 10-foot tall unicycle down the west side highway for some reason.

429
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:37,960
Rym: Here's a cool busker.

430
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:45,680
Rym: Here's someone shaving their legs in their car while driving Like parked in traffic in Manhattan.

431
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:47,006
Rym: It's just it's.

432
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:50,020
Rym: it's the fabric of life in New York that I love and miss.

433
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:57,308
Rym: but the moment in this video that actually got me the worst was we're just watching it and It was a subway drama situation.

434
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,480
Rym: But during the subway drama, it was like the low-key drama.

435
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:01,820
Rym: We're like nothing.

436
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:09,167
Rym: No one's gonna get hurt but there's some drama happening and the person recording the video is recording like a selfie and They're just looking at the camera with that.

437
00:28:09,248 --> 00:28:10,413
Rym: Look the look of.

438
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:13,876
Rym: there's some shit going down behind me And I really just want to close my eyes and ignore it.

439
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:20,459
Rym: Yep, but then I hear the sound of the subway doors closing and I realized I have not heard that sound since March.

440
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:26,719
Rym: Yeah These videos are weird like especially watching the videos like we watch a bunch of them.

441
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:32,840
Rym: They're all just like normal New York, but then you see like the quarantine start to happen and then the videos are very different.

442
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,206
Rym: Mm-hmm Sam I think of the day.

443
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,320
Scott: this whole channel is just like very have a lot of video like that just on my hard drive.

444
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,180
Rym: So, oh, yeah, I got a lot of like some shits going down.

445
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,880
Rym: I'm gonna video it in case either world star happens or I need to like help someone file charges against the cops.

446
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:55,220
Scott: But you know, I just I have lots of videos that could go on that channel probably Yeah archive but just to dig them out would be way too much effort.

447
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:09,344
Rym: yeah, like if I go back there's video from last year that I just remember where I was walking to Hebrew know and Two cars almost got into an accident and like five people got out of both of the cars and almost had a street brawl Mm-hmm.

448
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:10,819
Rym: So what do you got?

449
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,642
Scott: What do I have?

450
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:17,275
Scott: So everybody knows back in the day playing Minesweeper on their Windows 3.1 Windows 95 PC, right?

451
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,933
Scott: Yeah, I don't think Minesweeper still comes with Windows.

452
00:29:22,154 --> 00:29:22,717
Scott: It does not.

453
00:29:22,757 --> 00:29:23,360
Scott: that is a shame.

454
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:26,000
Scott: I'm sure you can get it if you want to play Minesweeper.

455
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,559
Scott: There's probably just a website you can go to to play Minesweeper, right?

456
00:29:29,162 --> 00:29:30,347
Scott: But people don't know.

457
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:31,552
Scott: is that Minesweeper?

458
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:33,380
Scott: that the way the game worked?

459
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:43,560
Scott: It was theoretically possible that at the end of a game of Minesweeper You could be in a situation where it was not logically possible to determine where the final mines were.

460
00:29:44,002 --> 00:29:47,635
Scott: You would have to guess like there was no option but to guess.

461
00:29:47,695 --> 00:29:51,611
Scott: it would be in one of two spots And you have to guess and you might win or lose right?

462
00:29:51,912 --> 00:30:01,009
Scott: and that was very disappointing because you'd be like hey I used my skills of deduction to figure out where every mine was using the clues And I got this far, but now there's no.

463
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:02,916
Scott: whether I win or lose is just a coin toss.

464
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:03,780
Scott: That's bullshit, right?

465
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,418
Scott: I want to be able to decide my way to the end.

466
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:10,220
Scott: People also don't know that you know Minesweeper.

467
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:14,420
Scott: What if you start a game of Minesweeper and the first click is on a mine?

468
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,386
Rym: I didn't know that was possible.

469
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:18,799
Rym: I always assumed it set the seed when you click because I never knew.

470
00:30:19,404 --> 00:30:20,597
Rym: I've never seen that happen in my life.

471
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:30,450
Scott: Here's why in Windows Minesweeper the old Microsoft Minesweeper the only one you've played probably right if Your first click happens to be a mine.

472
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:35,743
Scott: It rerolls the seed until it's not a mine Does.

473
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:42,272
Scott: my favorite was something like that it rolls a seed But then if your first click happens to be a mine it will reroll.

474
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:42,994
Rym: I think I broke it.

475
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:47,328
Rym: I Was reroll I was playing with it a whole bunch and now the link is dead.

476
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:55,113
Scott: Oh, no, it will reroll a whole bunch until You know, yeah, I think I brought it back.

477
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:55,455
Rym: It's good.

478
00:30:55,797 --> 00:31:04,874
Scott: They brought it anyway anyway anyway, so my thing of the day is Someone made this ingenious thing which is way better than you think.

479
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:06,380
Scott: pure skill Minesweeper.

480
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:20,660
Scott: So obviously it eliminates that problem at the end of the game and beginning of the game right where you know It's like oh, yeah, you don't want to get burned just by luck at the end right, but it goes actually a step further.

481
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:22,847
Scott: What it does is is all right.

482
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:31,468
Scott: well if we're going to allow this rerolling of the of the mines Nonsense right then what we're going to do Is not only at the end of the game.

483
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:35,179
Scott: right if you're stuck in a situation where you have to guess?

484
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,147
Scott: Right and there's no other option, but guessing.

485
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:41,900
Scott: we're going to make your guess always be a good guess right?

486
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,023
Scott: It's like you had to guess.

487
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:44,406
Scott: we're not going to screw you over.

488
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:48,236
Scott: you recognized in the game that guessing was necessary.

489
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:49,580
Scott: you clicked and guessed.

490
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,147
Scott: Congratulations, we're going to make sure you don't.

491
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:55,400
Scott: we're going to move the mines out of the way and give you a successful click.

492
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:59,462
Scott: Right whether that's the first click at the end of beginning or at the end Right.

493
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,171
Scott: you had to guess the first click of the game.

494
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:03,115
Scott: you have to guess right.

495
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:03,977
Scott: the last click.

496
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:05,783
Scott: you might have to guess Depending on the scenario.

497
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:06,646
Scott: Yeah, you won't.

498
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:09,215
Scott: you won't lose if you have to guess right?

499
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:10,338
Scott: We won't screw you over.

500
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:28,539
Scott: but what if you're in a situation where you don't have to guess there is a way to figure it out and You say you're too lazy Or you don't you're not good enough And you don't realize that there is a way to figure it out And you just go ahead and guess when you didn't have to guess.

501
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:34,795
Scott: The game will also reroll to put the mines and in the way and punish you.

502
00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:36,760
Scott: It's like that is brilliant.

503
00:32:37,463 --> 00:32:38,908
Scott: It's like oh you clicked on that spot.

504
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:41,940
Scott: Yeah, well guess what there wasn't a mine there in that spot.

505
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:47,480
Scott: But you clicked that spot and you there was no way for you to have known that that was a safe spot.

506
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,495
Scott: You click you click that spot, but you it wait there wasn't a mine.

507
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:57,520
Scott: You were lucky, but You couldn't have known that there wasn't a mine.

508
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:59,440
Scott: There's no way for you to know that that was safe.

509
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:03,980
Scott: And you weren't forced to guess in this scenario because you could have clicked over here.

510
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,547
Scott: You knew that this other spot was safe.

511
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:06,993
Scott: We're putting a mine there.

512
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:07,797
Scott: You're dead buddy.

513
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:11,467
Scott: You suck And that's pure skill minesweeper.

514
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:13,935
Scott: check it out to get your minesweeper fix.

515
00:33:14,316 --> 00:33:17,345
Scott: rip Microsoft solitaire I mean rut Microsoft minesweeper.

516
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:19,312
Scott: Hello pure skill minesweeper.

517
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:20,255
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty good.

518
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:21,097
Rym: I was poking at it.

519
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,788
Rym: Yep All right in the meta moment.

520
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:25,698
Rym: We're not really reading the book club book right now.

521
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:31,736
Scott: Nope We are appearing at the crunchyroll online convention.

522
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:32,258
Scott: When is that?

523
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:32,780
Scott: Where is that?

524
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:36,074
Rym: I haven't posted a schedule yet, but it is the way.

525
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:37,120
Rym: I think I just posted the news.

526
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,153
Rym: It's coming up like soon like beginning of September and okay, whatever that is.

527
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,440
Rym: We'll have a never-before-seen panel.

528
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,114
Rym: It's like a newer highly evolved rarified version of our judge anime by its cover.

529
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:50,180
Scott: It's a seen many times before panel.

530
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:58,500
Rym: Well, so basically instead of doing just judging a bunch of anime like we're doing on YouTube We took way back when we did this at anime Boston in person.

531
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:04,300
Rym: What we did is we spent like 10 minutes explaining how we judge and then we've judged everything.

532
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:08,540
Rym: We basically made the whole panel about how we judge and went kind of deeper into.

533
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:11,494
Scott: Basically the mostly the same thing is the anime Boston.

534
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:12,580
Scott: It's not a whole new panel.

535
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:13,342
Scott: It's a slight.

536
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:15,914
Scott: it's barely tweaked from what we've done in the.

537
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,400
Rym: I looked at those old slides.

538
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:18,909
Rym: We did it a lot better this time.

539
00:34:19,612 --> 00:34:20,820
Scott: I mean just doing something better.

540
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,248
Scott: You can't say there's a whole new never before seen.

541
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:24,514
Scott: I didn't say never before seen.

542
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:25,116
Rym: we did a lot more.

543
00:34:25,136 --> 00:34:32,580
Scott: exactly the words you Use there are just been recorded in this pod Unless you edit them out and this whole section out before you upload it.

544
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,476
Rym: But there is a lot of never resort before seen content because we expanded upon all those examples and went deeper with a lot more You're sure.

545
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:45,076
Scott: Anyway, we are also recording a panel for the packs online convention.

546
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,099
Scott: No, no duh.

547
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,786
Scott: Yeah We're obviously doing that.

548
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:49,393
Rym: Where is the finish line?

549
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:50,600
Rym: This one is completely new.

550
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:56,219
Rym: In fact, we haven't even finished the slides yet and we're recording a 100% new panel that I've been working on slowly.

551
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:59,216
Scott: You know, I had the idea before the virus times.

552
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:00,020
Scott: then there was a virus.

553
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:04,526
Scott: We probably would have done it like PAX West West.

554
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:05,794
Rym: this would have been a PAX West panel.

555
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,917
Rym: Yep In fact, I think I even put it in for packs wet like I was planning on doing it.

556
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:14,619
Scott: a PAX West Yeah, but anyway, I wrote this panel over a long period of time.

557
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:17,799
Rym: I'm currently editing and tweaking like we're getting ready almost a year ago.

558
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:21,108
Scott: But yeah It's about the panel is about right.

559
00:35:21,128 --> 00:35:28,639
Scott: you're designing a game and no matter what game you're designing There needs to be some rule in the game that says the game ends when this happens, right?

560
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,697
Scott: When does hockey end after the third 20-minute period of play, right?

561
00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:33,420
Scott: That's when it ends.

562
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:37,253
Scott: When does monopoly end when everyone's bankrupt except one person?

563
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:37,735
Scott: That's right.

564
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:45,600
Scott: You have to make up this rule No matter what game you're making video game When does it end when Ganon dies and you pick up the Triforce after the prince, you know, Princess Zelda, right?

565
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:54,740
Scott: There has to be a rule for when the game ends Assuming that you are designing an ortho game a game in which there are multiple players competing to win and or lose and be ranked.

566
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:57,810
Scott: How do you design this rule?

567
00:35:57,831 --> 00:35:59,640
Scott: a good way and not a bad way?

568
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:09,994
Scott: That is what this panel is about such a small narrow focus One hours worth of content and so check the panel out if you want to know that.

569
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:12,160
Rym: Yeah, and we're still writing it.

570
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,909
Rym: So we're still getting simple for writing like details like fill it in.

571
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:15,350
Scott: It's like 99.

572
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:15,651
Scott: It's 99% done.

573
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:16,052
Scott: It's a good flow.

574
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:27,452
Rym: What's cool is that this is a topic we in a lot of our recent talks for like the last four ish years Will edge into and talk about the surface level.

575
00:36:27,472 --> 00:36:28,174
Rym: but then we move on.

576
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:31,299
Scott: there's a lot of panels in the past There's a lot of panels in the past.

577
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,280
Scott: We've talked about games that have bad endings or go on too long go too short.

578
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,303
Scott: We've talked about quitting.

579
00:36:36,503 --> 00:36:38,429
Scott: quit is related to ending right.

580
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:39,271
Rym: take your damn turn.

581
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:42,260
Rym: where we talk about exactly why some games go on too long.

582
00:36:42,903 --> 00:36:43,787
Scott: Yeah, this you know.

583
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,280
Scott: length of games all of that ties into ending, right?

584
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,292
Scott: So now we're just gonna focus on the actual ending part.

585
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:50,819
Rym: Yeah, it should be a good time.

586
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,834
Scott: Yep, all right other meta anything.

587
00:36:54,895 --> 00:36:58,184
Rym: follow us in all the places like Google GeekNights.

588
00:36:58,224 --> 00:37:00,371
Rym: if you're not you're already listening to this podcast.

589
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:02,116
Scott: you have found us on all the place.

590
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:03,180
Rym: somehow you found us.

591
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:09,757
Rym: So yeah, whatever you did to find this just look around in the same area and you'll find there's there's.

592
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:12,649
Scott: there's a social network Or any kind of thing that you use.

593
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:13,393
Scott: guess what we're there.

594
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:16,567
Rym: Oh We don't use a snapchat.

595
00:37:16,787 --> 00:37:18,654
Rym: Is that still around the kids using snapchat?

596
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:20,399
Scott: I don't think we're on snapchat.

597
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,724
Rym: No Yeah, so there you go.

598
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:22,226
Rym: We're not there.

599
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:26,939
Rym: I guess we're technically on Facebook, but not that I would know I don't have a Facebook account.

600
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:30,510
Scott: I only rehab the Facebook account because of that page.

601
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:35,191
Rym: so in a in an ancient time I'll link to this episode.

602
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:41,508
Rym: on January 29th 7 1 13 years ago.

603
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:44,139
Rym: We had already been podcasting for like two years.

604
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:45,709
Rym: Yeah, and two.

605
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:48,566
Rym: we did a show called Removable media.

606
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:49,431
Rym: I'm sure.

607
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:50,737
Rym: in fact, I'm gonna read it tonight.

608
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:56,694
Rym: on GeekNights We talk about floppy drives CD roms DVDs cassettes and more.

609
00:37:56,714 --> 00:37:58,880
Rym: a hundred percent of those things are obsolete.

610
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:02,075
Scott: Yeah, funnily enough in only in only 13 years.

611
00:38:03,642 --> 00:38:08,550
Rym: The funny weird thing is when I went to this old episode My thing one thing of the day is just gone.

612
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,458
Rym: The other one is there this Frank Zappa thing like.

613
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:10,880
Rym: it's on YouTube.

614
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,640
Rym: It's still up, but we were talking about an Apple antitrust lawsuit in Norway.

615
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:18,502
Scott: Yeah, cuz.

616
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:27,051
Scott: that the Apple iTunes DRM on the music at the time meant that you could only listen to songs bought in iTunes on iPods and nor was like no no no.

617
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:30,659
Scott: if people buy music from iTunes They should be able to play it on any audio device.

618
00:38:31,082 --> 00:38:33,520
Scott: You're that's antitrust a violation in Norway.

619
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:40,121
Scott: And then they fixed it by removing the music DRM in the Apple store and iTunes and that doesn't matter anymore Cuz.

620
00:38:40,161 --> 00:38:41,671
Scott: now everyone has Apple music and Spotify.

621
00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:41,872
Rym: Yep.

622
00:38:42,094 --> 00:38:48,360
Rym: That's the follow-up but Back, then we probably talked about the history a bit based on you know, we mentioned floppies and whatever.

623
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:50,329
Rym: We don't need to get into the history too much.

624
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,760
Scott: But this is in the old episode.

625
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:59,013
Rym: Yeah, but this episode will be interesting not from the perspective of me talking about my use of a zip drive for so long but more about.

626
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:04,860
Rym: 2007 was a long time ago and the world is radically different in a lot of ways.

627
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,409
Rym: Technology is radically different.

628
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:09,731
Rym: how people interact with technology is right Radically different.

629
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:14,331
Rym: so What is removable media look like now in the year 2020?

630
00:39:14,331 --> 00:39:21,615
Rym: Cuz like I Don't really use removable media except SD cards in cameras.

631
00:39:21,635 --> 00:39:21,816
Rym: Yep.

632
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:27,285
Scott: That's the only removal I have for the most part in 2020.

633
00:39:27,285 --> 00:39:38,956
Scott: Most people don't need any removable media or very little because You know the the kind of read-only Removable media some people out there is still using boo-rays for whatever reason.

634
00:39:39,016 --> 00:39:40,020
Scott: I don't know, right?

635
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,948
Scott: They just just opposed to.

636
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:44,120
Scott: you know, they really want to own that plastic useless.

637
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:47,173
Rym: There is one one use case for boo-ray.

638
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:59,168
Scott: if you want to watch a movie without gradient problems in the dark spaces Sure, or if you want to be the person who rips the boo-ray for everyone else to watch with their pirated copy You're the pirate.

639
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:00,093
Scott: err for everyone else.

640
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:00,797
Scott: That's the reason.

641
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:08,220
Scott: But yeah, so people aren't buying things on removable media anymore, right?

642
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:17,200
Scott: People when they need to transfer their own data around to other devices Which is what we're mostly gonna talk about today, right?

643
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,893
Scott: You most people could just use a cloud service of some kind.

644
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:27,700
Scott: right use your Dropbox your Google Drive Your you know, Adobe creative cloud your iCloud, right?

645
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:32,660
Rym: Normal people like before we talk about us a normal person takes pictures with their phone.

646
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:36,199
Rym: They're already uploaded to the cloud somewhere and then if they're on their PC.

647
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:41,020
Rym: They go to like whatever thing their phone was doing to mess with their photos.

648
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:42,505
Scott: I call it photo.

649
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:45,093
Scott: people use airdrop on iPhones to send things directly.

650
00:40:45,113 --> 00:40:50,680
Scott: Yeah, people just text photos to each other Alright, they just Facebook message photos to each other, right?

651
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:58,459
Scott: It's like, you know music people don't really have mp3s anymore But if they did they could just sent, you know transfer them the same way.

652
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:07,340
Scott: You know, usually you'll just send a link to the song on Spotify or whatever Apple music Whatever it is, you send a link in a text message, right?

653
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:10,400
Scott: It's like there is very little reason to use removable media.

654
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:42,065
Scott: The only reasons to use removable media these days is if you have some non computer Recording device and you need to transfer a large amount of data Which would be too large or too slow to transfer over the network Yep, or if you have a device that has in itself limited storage capacity You can enhance its storage capacity for example a Nintendo switch usually with a micro SD card and then you could use that micro SD card as to transfer some things if you needed to or To back up if you needed to.

655
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:46,478
Scott: but usually you're just expanding the storage of the one device and that's it Yep.

656
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:54,326
Rym: So like I have these three Marantz's that we use for GeekNights like audio recording on the go like at conventions That takes compact flash.

657
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:59,000
Rym: So I have a whole bunch of compact flash cards that I'll use for that for the foreseeable future.

658
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:02,500
Scott: Mm-hmm, but nothing new would use compact flash.

659
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,162
Scott: Nope, right.

660
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:09,644
Scott: even the latest and greatest cameras which you used to be that when you buy the Ultra Pro cameras They had compact flash.

661
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:10,828
Scott: They're pretty much all.

662
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:14,140
Scott: SD now is as these plenty fast plenty big.

663
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:14,642
Scott: There is.

664
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:22,869
Scott: I think Nikon might have a special memory card that they might still use in some cameras, but for the most part It's like everything has SD slots.

665
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:30,268
Rym: now, you know the highest end stuff now Have a different use case but what they'll often use like if you like.

666
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:36,108
Rym: if we had all our if our cameras are all like one step bigger or two steps bigger and We're recording a lot of video.

667
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,862
Rym: We wouldn't be rotating SD cards We'd be capped.

668
00:42:38,902 --> 00:42:45,400
Rym: we'd be basically having the camera send the raw video to some sort of device that's filled with hard drives.

669
00:42:46,343 --> 00:42:47,432
Rym: Yeah, you see you can see that.

670
00:42:47,573 --> 00:42:48,360
Rym: go Google for this stuff.

671
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:56,740
Rym: You'll find like people will sell What basically is a suitcase that you plug like an SDI cable into it or like five SDI cables into it?

672
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:05,659
Rym: And it just records video to a whole bunch of spinning hard drives inside of itself or SD Okay, or like flash hard drives inside of itself.

673
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:11,479
Scott: Yeah, well because hard drives, you know in 2007 we were mostly, you know to get an.

674
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,291
Scott: You know a solid-state drive was a big deal.

675
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:21,510
Rym: Yeah, I had like a 256 gigabyte Solid-state drive that I barely got windows and stuff installed on.

676
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,677
Scott: I want to say I think I had a 16 gig one.

677
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,392
Rym: Maybe look actually yeah, that was pre 256.

678
00:43:27,392 --> 00:43:28,054
Rym: That was probably 30.

679
00:43:28,054 --> 00:43:34,897
Scott: I think that I think in 2007 if I even had one at all, I think my first solid-state drive was a 16 gig one.

680
00:43:36,927 --> 00:43:44,657
Scott: but anyway Yeah, so nowadays you don't really need most people don't need a magnetic drive in any device they have because they don't have that much data.

681
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:53,825
Scott: You're having solid-state drives and solid-state drives are so small these days that you can just put them in devices and Like so you don't.

682
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:58,017
Scott: really you can get a lot of storage with no moving parts like my GoPro.

683
00:43:58,077 --> 00:44:02,571
Rym: I have two Micro SD cards that are 256 gigabytes each.

684
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:03,735
Rym: they cost like nothing.

685
00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:05,280
Rym: They're the size of my pinky fingernail.

686
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,924
Scott: Yeah, it's like alright.

687
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:08,124
Scott: Well.

688
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:09,407
Scott: I guess we don't need store.

689
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:10,129
Scott: You know it's like.

690
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:17,049
Rym: I Know it's interesting in 2007. one thing.

691
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:22,168
Scott: I just looked it up the Nikon d5 Which is like the big monster giant.

692
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:29,530
Scott: Nikon has a compact flash slot and an xqd Slot which is the special Nikon thing it doesn't have.

693
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:30,674
Scott: it doesn't have SD.

694
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:32,098
Rym: Oh wow that's amazing.

695
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,984
Scott: Yeah, so that's a thing.

696
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:39,896
Rym: yep, so in terms of our actual usage like the only other thing.

697
00:44:39,936 --> 00:44:48,640
Rym: I really use as like Removal media for in the modern era Was a USB stick for like quickly moving a file around like oh, I gotta follow my laptop.

698
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:49,740
Rym: Let me go put it on my desktop.

699
00:44:50,181 --> 00:44:55,740
Rym: But I have gigabit ethernet like inside of my apartment, and I have a NAS inside of my apartment.

700
00:44:56,501 --> 00:45:04,399
Rym: anything on my laptop either goes up to Google Cloud or Up to any of my other cloud providers, or just goes up to my NAS and now I can access it from any computer.

701
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:12,040
Rym: and even worse like Nowhere I work will let you plug a USB stick into anything.

702
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,540
Rym: So it's not like I can use it to transfer files like the home from work or anything.

703
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:18,206
Rym: Really, I have no use for a USB stick like.

704
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:26,320
Rym: I don't have any working USB sticks except for a dish full of old ones That I guess I should go see if there's anything interesting on them, and then just delete them all throw them away.

705
00:45:26,904 --> 00:45:31,225
Scott: I use USB sticks for very Rare occasions right?

706
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:38,440
Rym: I used to put a backup copy of our panels on a USB stick That I would keep in my pocket when we travel to a convention.

707
00:45:38,621 --> 00:45:45,935
Rym: So if all our luggage got lost and all their technology broke That USB stick plus borrowing a laptop from someone would be enough to do the panel.

708
00:45:46,236 --> 00:45:47,480
Rym: I don't even bother with that anymore.

709
00:45:48,189 --> 00:45:50,660
Scott: Nope Because the panel's backed up on the internet.

710
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,709
Scott: I could run the panel off my phone if I had to.

711
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,980
Scott: I get the panel from Google slides.

712
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:59,060
Rym: Yeah, I download a PDF to the lab in case Google goes down.

713
00:45:59,421 --> 00:46:04,960
Scott: I have an HDMI output from my phone that I can run the panel with just the phone and nothing else.

714
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:08,700
Rym: Yeah, right Like that panel exists in so many places.

715
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:10,970
Scott: Okay, so actually I just looked up again.

716
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:11,493
Scott: I talked about.

717
00:46:11,513 --> 00:46:12,258
Scott: I looked at the Nikon d5.

718
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:13,223
Scott: I wasn't aware.

719
00:46:13,263 --> 00:46:14,449
Scott: the Nikon d6 is out.

720
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:18,345
Scott: it also does not have SD But the Nikon that's.

721
00:46:18,405 --> 00:46:25,906
Scott: that's like a mega DSLR like a giant that frickin thing right the Nikon d850 Which would be like a normal DSLR.

722
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:28,774
Rym: Oh, I just looked in my Amazon history from 2007.

723
00:46:28,774 --> 00:46:38,076
Rym: I spent $36 on a 2 gigabyte USB stick Wow.

724
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:45,820
Rym: and on December 18th 2007 Wow a Kensington data traveler 2 gigabyte USB Drive.

725
00:46:46,642 --> 00:46:49,327
Rym: Yeah, that's more than the harmonica.

726
00:46:49,447 --> 00:47:04,553
Rym: I bought at the same time Yep, so I think that basically what comes down to is if you are a normal person who does not Book a physical book that had a map of the subway and a map of New York City in it.

727
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:06,118
Scott: Oh, yeah the NFT.

728
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:14,800
Scott: in 2020 you Might just need a maybe some SD cards and you're good to go for all your external storage.

729
00:47:15,424 --> 00:47:17,479
Scott: Like if you really want to back up your stuff.

730
00:47:18,162 --> 00:47:28,840
Scott: You know because you have stuff to be backed up and the cloud backup is not sufficient for your personal needs But you don't have a lot of data, so I don't see why a couple cloud backups wouldn't be sufficient quick to upload.

731
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,848
Rym: Shit, you know what else.

732
00:47:29,908 --> 00:47:38,315
Rym: I bought in 2007 a portable DVD player With an LCD screen that could play a DVD directly.

733
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:45,646
Scott: Wow Yeah, you could just back up your life to like an SD card and put that in a safe place and you're good to go Right.

734
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:56,160
Rym: Yeah In this middle era between this show and the last time we talked about this with my old laptop One thing I started doing is I stopped using USB sticks because my laptop had an SD slot.

735
00:47:56,561 --> 00:48:00,256
Rym: So I would just use SD cards the way I used to use USB sticks.

736
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:01,360
Scott: Yeah, why not?

737
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,907
Rym: Yeah, now I don't even do that.

738
00:48:02,987 --> 00:48:04,055
Rym: But there was a time when I did.

739
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,920
Scott: Yeah But yeah, nowadays if you are a person who has a lot of data if you got photos you're gonna use SD cards.

740
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:16,080
Scott: Yeah, and you might need like a NAS or some kind of larger store, but that's not removable, right?

741
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,839
Scott: We've done NAS shows twice, right?

742
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,940
Scott: You're just gonna be something to back those up to maybe like a larger portable hard drive.

743
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:28,100
Scott: There are some storage devices these days that have their own network access, right?

744
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:33,000
Scott: It's like they have their own Wi-Fi access so you can connect your phone to them wirelessly.

745
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:50,739
Scott: You know assuming all you've got is a phone and the storage device you can connect your phone to the storage device with Wi-Fi and Send data back and forth usually with an app to back up the phone or load things from the storage device to the phone You know, so that's that's the thing if you have if you're doing stuff on the go.

746
00:48:51,563 --> 00:48:53,470
Scott: But yeah, it's like removable media is?

747
00:48:53,691 --> 00:48:56,180
Scott: it's like first the physical media died, right?

748
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,360
Scott: But what is physical media other than read only removable media?

749
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:05,720
Scott: Yeah, so it's like if we don't need physical media anymore, you know, it's because we're downloading everything.

750
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:13,655
Scott: Well, that means the network is so good that I don't need removable media to trick You know because really is just a way to transfer and store right.

751
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:18,732
Scott: so like I can use the network and to store everything.

752
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:21,240
Scott: every device has storage and I have cloud storage.

753
00:49:21,704 --> 00:49:23,620
Scott: So it's stored on every place.

754
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,764
Scott: I want it to be heard.

755
00:49:24,784 --> 00:49:29,440
Rym: Scott and I had to record a panel for the crunchyroll Expo that judge anime panel remotely.

756
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:35,396
Rym: So at the end of that I had 50 gigabytes of video and Scott had 50 gigabytes of video.

757
00:49:35,697 --> 00:49:41,359
Rym: in the olden times We would have to put Scott would have to like put that on a SD card or USB stick and physically get it to me.

758
00:49:41,782 --> 00:49:48,325
Rym: Scott just uploaded it To Google and then I downloaded it Like yeah, was it?

759
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:48,908
Rym: it just work.

760
00:49:48,928 --> 00:49:51,440
Scott: Well, that is that is because we both have files, right?

761
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,706
Scott: So you both have fast internet.

762
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:55,680
Scott: if I still had slow internet that would have taken so long.

763
00:49:55,921 --> 00:50:00,417
Scott: Yeah, it might have still been faster to transfer using physical to bike it over here, right?

764
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:04,281
Scott: So if you we could have used the SD cards, all right So.

765
00:50:04,842 --> 00:50:14,228
Scott: but if you look there are still some cases where people have to transfer so much data that even the fast Internet or you know, even a LAN is too slow.

766
00:50:14,248 --> 00:50:17,517
Scott: and in these cases there are many services being offered.

767
00:50:17,537 --> 00:50:32,820
Scott: Amazon offers one I know I think Google does as well Maybe where they will send you a hard drive or a storage device of some kind that you then plug in to your local Network or local devices fill it up and mail it back to them.

768
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:43,830
Scott: And if you are sending enough terabytes of data terabytes then the cost of doing this which is actually not that high Becomes and the speed it becomes worthwhile.

769
00:50:43,910 --> 00:51:00,070
Scott: because if for you to do the network transfer, you know It would have been faster because yeah local transfer is still faster than network transfer even if you have gigabit Ethernet connection, it's like well, you know, it's like a Frickin, you know USB C cables can go faster than that, right?

770
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,778
Scott: So, you know East Ada can go faster than that.

771
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:10,220
Scott: Yeah Plugging maybe I can plug something in directly to a PCI Express slot, you know MVNO or whatever it is called these days.

772
00:51:11,162 --> 00:51:15,031
Rym: I just can't get over this to me and NVMe?

773
00:51:16,502 --> 00:51:20,576
Scott: No is mobile voice something that NVMe is?

774
00:51:20,616 --> 00:51:21,620
Scott: the is the thing I was thinking.

775
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:24,448
Scott: You can see why I would confuse the two.

776
00:51:24,488 --> 00:51:32,457
Rym: at least I hope yeah, but at least in our like Professional use cases like we have no real uses for physical media day-to-day.

777
00:51:32,498 --> 00:51:38,199
Rym: like in 2007 I carried a USB stick on my keychain all the time just in case with like some critical files and stuff.

778
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:43,096
Scott: in 1997 I carried a plastic container full of floppy disks that I still have.

779
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:44,300
Rym: I carried the same around.

780
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:44,841
Rym: I had.

781
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:48,452
Rym: I'd had like it had important games and important files for school.

782
00:51:48,753 --> 00:52:04,316
Rym: It had my mud client at RIT I and when I was a freshman, I had one zip disk that I would put put into the internal zip drive of my PC and All my visual basic projects for my programming classes were on that zip disk.

783
00:52:04,396 --> 00:52:07,519
Rym: and then I take it to the lab Which also had an internal zip drive?

784
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:16,720
Rym: Mmm, and then RIT set up the network better so I could access remote shares over the RIT network And then that zip drive was just a waste of money and I never used it again.

785
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:20,800
Rym: Yeah, they set that up by the end of our freshman year if I recall correctly.

786
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:26,309
Scott: So my prediction here is actually that Given another 13 years, right?

787
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,900
Scott: The capacity of the SD cards, right?

788
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:32,428
Scott: It's if they can make it.

789
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,240
Scott: if they've reached a limit they reach a limit.

790
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:36,479
Scott: But if they I'm not sure if they will or not.

791
00:52:37,103 --> 00:52:44,234
Scott: But if they don't reach a limit or if the limit is high enough You're gonna have like maybe terabyte SD card or something.

792
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:45,358
Rym: Well, here's one way to go.

793
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,999
Rym: camera Remember video like the camcorder we used to use for gig nights It had an SD card slot.

794
00:52:50,321 --> 00:52:55,800
Rym: But it's selling point because back then SD cards were tiny was that it had a hard drive in it.

795
00:52:56,282 --> 00:53:04,040
Rym: And the idea was you record directly in camera and the camera itself Plugs into a computer via the much faster USB to get the data off of it, right?

796
00:53:04,523 --> 00:53:11,498
Scott: So if the if you can get storage that small that large You're not gonna need removable storage because you're never gonna fill up any device.

797
00:53:11,538 --> 00:53:16,580
Rym: You've got The fast cable coming out of that device, whatever it is, right?

798
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:20,071
Scott: You only need a way to transfer between devices, right?

799
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:20,713
Scott: That's fast.

800
00:53:21,014 --> 00:53:22,760
Scott: And I think well probably that networks.

801
00:53:22,921 --> 00:53:24,146
Scott: I think you're just getting it faster.

802
00:53:24,227 --> 00:53:29,580
Scott: Also, especially if you know, we look at 5g There's gonna be a 6g right, you know.

803
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:34,776
Scott: And plus the potential of 5g speed wise is really way up there compared to what they're actually gonna give us.

804
00:53:35,137 --> 00:53:37,064
Scott: but over time They'll make it faster.

805
00:53:37,104 --> 00:53:40,216
Scott: They'll actually give us, you know more of the full 13 years.

806
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:41,741
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna get faster Right.

807
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:55,840
Scott: So what you're gonna see is like transfer between devices will be so fast that you won't ever Rare like almost never need to use some other mechanism to transfer data other than just wireless connection.

808
00:53:56,547 --> 00:54:07,309
Scott: Right, it's like oh, okay I recorded a 4k video on my camera and it's already on my computer because Transferring it was as fast as writing it to the storage.

809
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,631
Scott: Yeah, I know to the camera.

810
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:10,856
Scott: It's like, okay, you know great.

811
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,960
Scott: Oh Yeah, like my camera I can push a button on it and it can just live stream the video itself, right?

812
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,920
Rym: We're getting there like the newer version.

813
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,991
Rym: Okay, my camcorder is a little old at this point already because times flying.

814
00:54:23,352 --> 00:54:29,099
Rym: but and also I bought it toward the end of its Like life cycle because I knew a new one was coming out and it was way cheap because of that.

815
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:34,175
Rym: But the newer version of my camcorder has RTMP streaming and Wi-Fi just built in.

816
00:54:34,436 --> 00:54:38,235
Rym: plug an ethernet cable into it It'll the stream RTMP over that ethernet cable Wi-Fi.

817
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:38,959
Rym: It'll just do it.

818
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:40,021
Scott: Yep.

819
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:42,569
Rym: Now RTMP is not going to.

820
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:43,732
Rym: you're not gonna stream.

821
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:46,360
Rym: You're like 8k 60 video over that shit.

822
00:54:46,962 --> 00:54:51,940
Rym: No, but if you're like I'll record in 4k to the SD card on a future camera like that.

823
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:59,203
Rym: But a lot of the time what I'm doing is live streaming where I don't need that quality the dual 13.

824
00:54:59,203 --> 00:54:59,946
Scott: in 13 years you will be able to.

825
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:15,180
Scott: maybe it'll be expensive but you'll be able to live stream like 4k video directly from a phone or other camera like directly to like twitch or whatever just like 4k video.

826
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:16,364
Scott: You got a camera.

827
00:55:16,404 --> 00:55:18,071
Scott: You don't need any other equipment at all.

828
00:55:18,372 --> 00:55:18,874
Scott: records.

829
00:55:19,396 --> 00:55:29,380
Scott: It records it locally Encodes it streams it at the end There's no there's no lag or any problems and you don't need removable storage to transfer or do anything like that.

830
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:30,871
Scott: You can just do it everything.

831
00:55:30,891 --> 00:55:32,000
Scott: Yeah fast enough.

832
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:42,351
Rym: Well, that's one future because the other future is we're hiding in the hollowed-out remains of an abandoned US Postal Service Trying to survive assuming we make it to the future of 30.

833
00:55:42,351 --> 00:55:46,440
Scott: Yeah, that is the level of technology in this one specific area.

834
00:55:46,649 --> 00:56:02,239
Scott: Yeah But yeah, you know, it's weird because it's like, you know, we the cliche has always been you know, at least since the Since the CD I think and since the V since the DVD there's been as cliche of.

835
00:56:03,222 --> 00:56:05,307
Scott: Yeah, old people used records.

836
00:56:05,347 --> 00:56:21,838
Scott: young people use a different thing because before the record and there was what the wax cylinder right there There weren't too many recorded medias before then right the wax cylinder was really well There's a bunch of cool stuff black Right, there weren't too many, right?

837
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,287
Scott: So it's like there's always been this cliche of like.

838
00:56:25,307 --> 00:56:28,456
Scott: this generation used this kind of physical media that generate.

839
00:56:28,516 --> 00:56:31,430
Scott: the previous generation used a different One but we're gonna reach.

840
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:32,840
Scott: basically we saw the beginning.

841
00:56:33,081 --> 00:56:34,547
Scott: We're gonna see the end where it's like.

842
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:41,200
Scott: no, they'll be generations and between the generations There weren't any differences in physical media because there was just none.

843
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:42,405
Scott: They didn't use any.

844
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:42,687
Scott: this.

845
00:56:42,727 --> 00:56:45,540
Scott: well you should use none and the generation add to them use none.

846
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:54,260
Rym: There is one place physical media will persist even in that future, but that is the like Archival use cases that are not operational use cases.

847
00:56:54,642 --> 00:57:00,848
Scott: There are not things that everyday people will use their only things that Businesses or other like in that future.

848
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:17,560
Rym: your cell phone will stream 8k 60 video if you want but the studio camera records a full 3d like Environment in real time and infinite like brain resolution, but that's the thing that has physical media and normally people don't use that.

849
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:24,480
Scott: So even though this is a repeat show from 13 years ago, I think you know, the situation is drastically changed.

850
00:57:24,781 --> 00:57:27,529
Rym: Well, I might listen to that old episode just to see one.

851
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,194
Rym: That's 2007 where that was.

852
00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:32,026
Rym: that was so long ago We were.

853
00:57:32,046 --> 00:57:32,629
Scott: so hopefully we.

854
00:57:33,012 --> 00:57:38,174
Scott: I'm sure we did something, you know I'm always worried about the old GeekNights episodes because I'm sure we said some shit.

855
00:57:38,194 --> 00:57:40,864
Scott: We should be canceled for oh There.

856
00:57:40,884 --> 00:57:49,075
Rym: but so actually you never listened to the remastered with commentary Beta episodes that I uploaded because I pointed out a few things.

857
00:57:49,176 --> 00:57:52,268
Rym: if we say bad shit We're not not too bad, but we are close.

858
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:57,449
Rym: multiple times you use you use some words You don't use anymore because you didn't know better.

859
00:57:57,469 --> 00:57:59,217
Rym: Uh, I do.

860
00:57:59,237 --> 00:58:01,021
Rym: we were I Know.

861
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:05,135
Rym: yeah, I know that we both but but it's not as bad as I expected.

862
00:58:05,577 --> 00:58:06,500
Rym: like it wasn't that bad.

863
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,959
Rym: We were mostly okay, and that was the beta episodes that we didn't think anyone would ever hear.

864
00:58:11,941 --> 00:58:20,191
Rym: But in terms of how much we've changed so I'm uh, I've kind of been looking at my Amazon history Which actually gives me an idea for a Thursday like fun show.

865
00:58:20,592 --> 00:58:31,939
Rym: we should both just go in our online order history Pick like an early year and look at all the shit We ordered that year and talk about like what that what that archaeology is about our lives because you know what else.

866
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:50,217
Rym: I bought in 2017 or in 2007 Historical maps of the Napoleonic Wars a go board a whole bunch of El Hazzard DVDs And I bought a primer for the LSATs because I was thinking about quitting my tech job and taking the LSATs and going to law school.

867
00:58:51,222 --> 00:58:51,584
Scott: All right.

868
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:53,880
Scott: Well, let's do that on a Thursday right at the right that day.

869
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:58,690
Rym: Well, I'm writing that down right now because otherwise we will not do that But this week is Wednesday.

870
00:58:58,731 --> 00:58:59,940
Scott: We got to do next Thursday.

871
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,749
Rym: We'll do that show if we if we remember that I said this and I look at this note that I just wrote and with That I am super hungry.

872
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:08,099
Scott: Let's end this too young show.

873
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:16,010
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

874
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:20,830
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
