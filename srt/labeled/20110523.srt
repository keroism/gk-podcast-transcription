1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,315
Rym: It's Monday, May 23rd, 2011.

2
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:19,089
Rym: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight corporate training.

3
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:24,197
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:31,687
Rym: So last night we're hanging out, you know fancy dinner hanging out on the town and We start talking about.

5
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:35,708
Rym: my little pony just comes up But the conversation pretty much.

6
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,560
Rym: ponies come up and then Scott is like, oh my god.

7
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:41,734
Rym: Let me tell you all the reasons why my little pony is awesome.

8

Rym: one, two, three four.

9
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:44,969
Rym: It was a relating conversation.

10
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:46,034
Scott: You got to convince people.

11
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:48,720
Scott: Otherwise, they don't believe I Don't.

12
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,880
Rym: it was a. it was a surprising expression of enthusiasm not often seen from Scott.

13
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:55,847
Scott: Okay, but anyway, let it.

14
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:57,774
Scott: let me go through many small opening bits.

15
00:00:57,795 --> 00:00:58,899
Rym: Yeah, a lot of stuff happens.

16
00:00:58,939 --> 00:00:59,220
Rym: We long.

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,139
Scott: You're not gonna go that I'm gonna blow my whole load.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,044
Scott: I can only use three.

19
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:05,559
Scott: save some of the load and you just use three small opening bits from today, right?

20
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,945
Scott: Opening bit number one.

21
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:08,653
Scott: Yeah warm today.

22
00:01:08,673 --> 00:01:09,918
Rym: Well, I'm today indeed.

23
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:10,280
Rym: You know what?

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,350
Rym: I didn't bike this morning because it was still wet.

25
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:16,089
Scott: also the truth for me as well But I got new hiking boots.

26
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,159
Rym: cuz this weekend I'm gonna climb another mile-high mountain.

27
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,043
Scott: Yeah, good for you.

28
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:22,960
Rym: Uh, I had to wear him in so I just ran home from work in my jeans.

29
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,679
Rym: Okay, and it didn't take that long.

30
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:32,965
Scott: Number two on the subway platform this morning on the way to work There was a crazy guy.

31
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:38,928
Scott: but you know how crazy like yelling crazy there's crazy guys all the time But this guy was particularly crazy.

32
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:40,735
Scott: That's why I'm that's why I'm mentioning him.

33
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:43,024
Scott: if he was just regular crazy He wouldn't have been noteworthy.

34
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:44,649
Rym: So what manner of crazy?

35
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,800
Rym: I mean, there's the agitated crazy guy who's like bothered about something.

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,679
Rym: There's just the screaming yelling like crazy woodley-woo guy.

37
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:53,229
Rym: There's the like quiet rocking themselves.

38
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:59,460
Rym: cuz someone should call the police and you know, take care of him crazy Check on the first two, but not the third one, right?

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,623
Rym: So yelling and crazy.

40
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:16,014
Scott: so I get there and there's a guy and I he's a guy sitting on the bench and there's a guy basically bent over saying something at him a whole lot and I can't really make it out cuz I got my headphones in and also When I took the headphones out, you couldn't really make out what the guy was saying.

41
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,019
Scott: Anyway, cuz he was a crazy guy.

42
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,688
Rym: Have it a jibbity-jubilee?

43
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:20,170
Scott: pretty much.

44
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,773
Scott: Yeah, but he was.

45
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:24,911
Scott: he was yelling jibbity-jubilee Alright, so I put my headphones in and I ignore him.

46
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,680
Scott: Alright, cuz you can't get involved with that shit.

47
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:38,635
Scott: Nope, eventually the guy sort of stops bending over and getting in the other guy's face and but the crazy guy You know once he gets out of the guy's face He's basically jumping up and down a little bit yelling his jibbity-jubilee.

48
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:40,000
Rym: Was he waving his arms?

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,840
Scott: No, but he had a cane and he was basically jumping and stomping and shaking.

50
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:46,223
Scott: It's like he was.

51
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:51,140
Scott: it's like he had punches in him and he was releasing the punches without punching anything, right?

52
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:58,945
Scott: but then he got like he got a little more crazy like he's pointing his cane at people and getting kind of weird.

53
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:10,095
Scott: and then when the train showed up like he like when there's this girl standing next to me and he basically goes behind her and Pushes the air but like but like he was gonna push her onto the tracks.

54
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,646
Rym: Whoa Which there was.

55
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,760
Rym: there was a big rat.

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,640
Rym: Well, not a big rash, but there was a time when that was a danger.

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,960
Rym: There was a small rash of crazy people just pushing people onto the tracks.

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,179
Scott: Yeah, but it's like the train was already there, but he like he pushes the air.

59
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:28,124
Rym: That's not good that that guy's practicing and the girl like goes like That guy's training.

60
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:28,505
Rym: Hmm.

61
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:31,353
Scott: Yeah, but it's like it was a crazy guy.

62
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:33,058
Scott: watch out crazy guy.

63
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:41,193
Scott: and the third thing there's a place that eat lunch sometimes called fresh & Co and they got Salad and sandwiches and the sandwiches they have a pretty good like.

64
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:41,534
Scott: they're not.

65
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,147
Scott: they won't fill you up that much But they're pretty cheap like six seven bucks.

66
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:51,737
Scott: and they put him in this incredibly hot convection oven and they taste they have like the most Flavor of any sandwich that you can get in the area.

67
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:55,385
Scott: Nah So they were tweeting.

68
00:03:55,606 --> 00:04:00,300
Scott: they were like trivia win lunch and I won lunch by direct messaging a tweet.

69
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:01,184
Scott: So I got.

70
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:02,550
Scott: I got a sandwich in the water.

71
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,690
Rym: Well, that's how I got those tickets to Scott Pilgrim Wasn't because of fancy industry connections or anything.

72
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:15,000
Rym: I just won the Midtown Comics contest by tweeting Yeah, because apparently everyone's really slow but actually tweeting if something happens.

73
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:16,350
Scott: Yeah, so it knows.

74
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,519
Scott: so I actually you know.

75
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,719
Scott: So I was just asked my co-worker what the answer the trivia was and I just got it.

76
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:28,260
Rym: I got a minor geek bite considered a review of an app because you see until recently I had The palm free which had no apps to review.

77
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:38,539
Rym: Yeah now well there was one app because what I really needed one of the killer apps for a smartphone for me was Using GPS data to gather statistics like heat maps of where I go.

78
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:45,469
Rym: You know if I go hiking or running seeing a map of like how far I went how long I went if I'm like Exploring and I find a weird thing.

79
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:50,427
Rym: I can look back on the map and see where I was And I couldn't use latitude or anything.

80
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:54,720
Rym: So I end up using this thing called smart runner and it kind of sucks.

81
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:57,239
Rym: But it was the best one there was.

82
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:59,089
Rym: People use it and it was free.

83
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,140
Rym: I could pay the right price.

84
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,419
Rym: I mean I could have paid for like more stuff.

85
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,940
Rym: But the stuff that offered was kind of dumb and I had this website.

86
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,480
Rym: It all worked pretty well, except the app just kind of sucked.

87
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,226
Rym: So I get my new phone.

88
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:15,909
Rym: I install smart run around it cuz I already got a ton of data in it And it still sucks.

89
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,097
Rym: It wasn't that it sucked because it was on the pre.

90
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:22,532
Rym: it just sucks No, but even the pay app isn't any better.

91
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,060
Rym: you just get more features on the site.

92
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,706
Rym: Okay, not in the app.

93
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,280
Rym: All right, you gotta pay for like a membership to the site.

94
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,504
Scott: What sucks about it?

95
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:37,307
Rym: So you'll be running you turn it on right and first it just never seems to get a GPS sync Like it just doesn't use the API correctly.

96
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:37,989
Scott: Okay.

97
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:44,892
Rym: Meanwhile, I turn on like latitude immediate sync maps immediate sync smart runner Red red red red.

98
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:46,460
Scott: So it's just a poorly coded piece of shit.

99
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:50,640
Rym: Or it would be like you're good to go Rym and I'd be like, okay smart runner and I'd start running.

100
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:59,299
Rym: And then I get home after like three hours of running and I look and it lost the sink like Ten feet out and not recorded anything else.

101
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:05,180
Rym: yeah, so I Was looking on the app sounds like not so smart runner.

102
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:09,740
Rym: Yeah, so I was looking on the App Store and I realized that Google does everything great.

103
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,703
Rym: So I just had Google into it and I just downloaded every Google app that would do anything I want.

104
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:15,670
Scott: it was made by Google.

105
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,180
Rym: Yes, actually made by Google.

106
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,445
Scott: That's usually the best thing to get.

107
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:27,840
Scott: you have a Google phone with the Google OS and a Google account Because none of that stuff could every every every app written by Google is probably gonna work pretty well.

108
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,540
Rym: So, of course, you know Google Translate is just great.

109
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:33,713
Rym: I said oh my why motion did it and got it immediately.

110
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:35,199
Scott: works exactly the same on iPhone.

111
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:40,182
Rym: Yep Yeah, and then I got I didn't even know this existed Google tracks Mm-hmm.

112
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:47,283
Rym: Google tracks is basically everything the smart runner pretended to be but actually works Really?

113
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:49,992
Scott: Well, let me see if that is an available option.

114
00:06:50,273 --> 00:06:52,460
Rym: and basically it's Google latitude on crack.

115
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:55,416
Rym: You can set it to like what interval you want it to do.

116
00:06:55,436 --> 00:07:01,535
Rym: GPS updates It draws this like perfect line of where you are and altitude and grade and speed.

117
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:02,698
Rym: and it's just.

118
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:03,200
Rym: and it's all.

119
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,932
Rym: you can Just export all the data for free to whatever format you want.

120
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:06,254
Rym: It's just.

121
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:07,459
Rym: it's fucking awesome.

122
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:15,402
Scott: Google tracks does Not exist for oh so sad So sad, so yeah Google track.

123
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:22,575
Rym: if you're looking for anything to track where you go in any kind of generalized sense Really just use Google latitude and Google track.

124
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:23,300
Rym: everything else sucks.

125
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:28,651
Rym: Okay, yeah, so that was my bite.

126
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:31,179
Rym: there's it's a Tuesday Monday.

127
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:33,980
Rym: It's it is Monday.

128
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:42,959
Scott: It's like the best inside joke of GeekNights is that whenever we record a show on the wrong day later early We all we never keep it hidden, even though we act like we're gonna keep it hidden, but we don't.

129
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:43,970
Rym: yeah We always like back.

130
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:44,619
Rym: date it like it.

131
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,194
Scott: This is the show for the 23rd of May 11 recorded on the 24th of May 11.

132
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,460
Rym: Yep, because we did something fun anyway.

133
00:07:53,350 --> 00:08:00,560
Scott: So yeah There's this big deal going around about a patent troll that went after people making apps for the iPhone and the iPad.

134
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,131
Rym: The sort of thing happens all the time all the time.

135
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:18,520
Scott: so what happened here is that Apple added a feature to the the app API that you could make an app that had in-app purchases Which means you buy an app and the app might even be free But then in the app you might buy something else.

136
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,420
Scott: So like you could have a farm ville and then in the farm ville buy a plow for five bucks, right?

137
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:25,798
Scott: So they added that feature.

138
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:31,395
Scott: So apparently that feature is patented by a company named LOD SIS, which is a patent troll.

139
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:33,100
Scott: Yeah, they don't actually make anything.

140
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:43,340
Rym: Yeah you can pretty much always tell the patent trolls because they'll have a patent on something stupid that everyone already does and They don't actually have any products but lawsuits, right?

141
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:56,622
Scott: So LOD SIS sent out a bunch of cease and desist letters to people not Apple, but to companies that made Apps using this, you know, but in-app purchase feature a common tactic The the.

142
00:08:56,843 --> 00:09:04,239
Rym: the biggest thing a patent troll will do is usually go after a lot of small Who can't do anything because those people can't fight against it.

143
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:10,098
Rym: They'll usually settle or they'll might they might fight it and they'll often lose because they don't have the resources to fight it.

144
00:09:10,238 --> 00:09:13,600
Rym: one guy Thus lending legitimacy to the patent lawsuit.

145
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:15,099
Rym: So then they go to the final lawsuit.

146
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,796
Rym: They point back to all the people who settled or all the people who lost.

147
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:23,876
Scott: one guy Suggested right that when things like this happened that it's a risk.

148
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,000
Scott: He said it's a risky move.

149
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:33,249
Scott: He admitted it but one strategy might be to get all of the people who receive cease and desist letters To file on at the same exact time.

150
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,940
Scott: and it would cost about two thousand per person to do this filing.

151
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:51,265
Scott: but by filing all at the same time in unison, the troll would be forced to respond to all of those on the same day at Incredible expense and that that expense could actually outweigh any Possible, you know increase.

152
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:58,849
Scott: so instead of settling with the patent troll and giving them, you know thousands multiplied by everyone they sent a letter to you could give that.

153
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:07,458
Scott: you could give a few thousand to a bunch of lawyers all over the place and Basically, the patent troll would be crushed All right, and they wouldn't get anything but anyway.

154
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:13,982
Scott: So lots of sent out these letters and then it was quiet for a while as all these app developers didn't know what the fuck to do.

155
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:25,762
Scott: and then Apple finally came out today and they were like They sent a letter to Lozas and the letter was basically like look we licensed your fucking patent we gave you money already and Here is the.

156
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:30,135
Scott: here in fact is the text of that patent license that we bought from you.

157
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:35,592
Scott: and look it says that we can Transfer the license to this from this patent to our app developers.

158
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:37,237
Scott: So fuck you, right?

159
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,959
Scott: Stop harassing our developers or else.

160
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:49,369
Scott: And I imagine Apple has enough money to fight Lozas, but again, I want to ask the question Why did Apple license it in the first place?

161
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,819
Scott: Why didn't Apple just buy Lozas?

162
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,679
Rym: Outright why probably was cheaper to settle with them?

163
00:10:56,101 --> 00:11:00,577
Scott: But it's like if you license the pen you're gonna have to keep licensing it until the patent is is done.

164
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,184
Scott: for was it 14 Years something like that.

165
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,630
Rym: Yeah still probably cheaper.

166
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:09,119
Rym: Also, I think there's a more fundamental question Why do patents like this even exist?

167
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:10,665
Scott: Why don't?

168
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:11,147
Scott: and it's like.

169
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:16,013
Scott: I know that all the tech companies basically have Armies of patents and that they all use.

170
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,520
Scott: they're all defensive patents, right?

171
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:24,880
Scott: It's like if I have enough patents against IBM and IBM has enough patents against me then we can't sue each other because then we'll both open up our you know.

172
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:25,976
Rym: Yeah I mean I filed.

173
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:35,380
Rym: you know there was huge pressure when I worked at IBM to get patents and I actually filed a Stupid patent because I was kind of told to buy my bosses and it's a student the stupidest thing ever.

174
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:53,979
Rym: But yet due to the way patents work and our messed up system of what is patentable It was eminently patentable to write a bash script that will look at the hardware of a system and come up with a unique Identifier to then be bait to be based on the MAC address to be used as a temporary DNS name for loading a box

175
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:54,822
Scott: Uh-huh.

176
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:56,849
Rym: Yeah, what kind of BS is that?

177
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:57,531
Rym: That's the patent.

178
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:58,715
Rym: I find that's complete bullshit.

179
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:11,757
Scott: Yep, but yeah It's like even if the patents exist if these companies all all the tech companies really hate the patents and they're really, you know Being honest that they just want them for defensive purposes then IBM Microsoft Google Apple.

180
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:12,540
Scott: That should be enough.

181
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,120
Scott: Maybe throw Oracle in there if those five get together and just say all right all our pet.

182
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:23,668
Scott: let's you know, let's take all our patents and We'll all simultaneously put him in the shredder.

183
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,694
Scott: right then know that.

184
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:30,180
Scott: because then the patent trolls Then they use their money to buy the patent trolls.

185
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,797
Scott: Oh put those in the shredder - no cuz buying the patent troll means they still win.

186
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:34,560
Rym: they get their money.

187
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,764
Rym: That's all they want is money.

188
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:37,992
Scott: No, because here's the thing, right?

189
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:39,276
Scott: So you are a pet.

190
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:40,440
Scott: you own a patent troll company.

191
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,412
Scott: Yes, I buy your company.

192
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:47,874
Rym: Yep, I fire you You buy my company I cash out.

193
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:51,335
Scott: No, the Money is part is the company's money.

194
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,060
Scott: It's not your money.

195
00:12:52,321 --> 00:13:01,440
Rym: Yeah, and I you know, maybe the board of directors on a patent troll company like that They probably don't even have shareholders or if they do it might be a small number.

196
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:04,320
Scott: But it's like if you have Rym Co and I buy Rym Co.

197
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,679
Scott: All right.

198
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,806
Rym: So a million dollars.

199
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,500
Scott: that million dollars is property of Rym Co not property of Rym.

200
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:09,905
Scott: And then I fire Rym.

201
00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:11,610
Scott: now Rym is homeless bond Scott.

202
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,072
Rym: Wait a minute.

203
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:14,560
Rym: You're not quite understanding how buying a company works.

204
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:23,379
Rym: Okay, so if I buy a startup company for a million dollars and the money is the mid companies then by your logic I just get that money back and I got the company for free.

205
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:31,053
Scott: Well, no good the money comes back in the company But it goes to the people who you know, who does it go?

206
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:31,314
Scott: to?

207
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:32,560
Scott: the shareholders of Rym Co?

208
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:42,049
Rym: Yeah so Rym Co the patent troll is probably just me and I probably only have three employees like a lawyer an Engineer and another lawyer.

209
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:47,651
Scott: Well, that's you know, I assume that there would be like all you know It would be a publicly traded one because it was private.

210
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:49,076
Rym: So is this company publicly traded?

211
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:49,980
Rym: You can I have right now?

212
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,189
Rym: I have no fucking clue because Even if it is how many shares are there?

213
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,780
Rym: and to what are the shareholders and the board of directors want?

214
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,070
Rym: I mean you could pay out a dividend to all the shareholders and Simultaneously pay a huge bonus to yourself.

215
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,156
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't look like it's public.

216
00:14:03,438 --> 00:14:03,760
Rym: You know what?

217
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,003
Scott: I can't find it on Google.

218
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:08,011
Rym: I pay myself a huge bonus and then I quit.

219
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:11,180
Scott: see but what what point can we you know?

220
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:12,023
Scott: Not pay?

221
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:14,072
Scott: at what point does the ownership come to me?

222
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:17,692
Scott: so I can not pay you the huge bonus But you have to pay me the huge bonus.

223
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:21,471
Scott: who says I'm the boss I own the company now and what exactly does that mean?

224
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,620
Rym: What's the when's the date of that happening?

225
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,838
Rym: What contract are you gonna agree to after after you before you get the money?

226
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:31,873
Rym: I'm the boss Because I'm a patent holder my company.

227
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:33,479
Rym: I have the right to just say you know what?

228
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:38,032
Rym: I don't want to be bought and I'm not gonna license this to you.

229
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,858
Rym: So stop selling your product.

230
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:47,731
Rym: Mmm It's not quite as simple as you think and buying the patent trolls Just makes being a patent troll super awesome.

231
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:50,300
Scott: Yeah, but there has to be a way to just get rid of all of them.

232
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,826
Scott: Yes, there aren't that many there is.

233
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:52,769
Rym: it's a very simple way.

234
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,395
Rym: It's called patent law reform.

235
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:54,777
Scott: Yeah.

236
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:55,600
Scott: Well, yeah, that's another.

237
00:14:56,162 --> 00:15:02,180
Scott: Unless the thing is I'm basically assuming here right that the government is useless as it's been useless and counterproductive.

238
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:06,657
Scott: So I'm trying to find ways to solve these problems without the government.

239
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:15,826
Rym: wait Hear me out rather than getting all the big companies who are relatively benign and intelligent and large and techy together And shredding the patents.

240
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:31,891
Rym: They should put all of those patents into a consortium Mm-hmm that are basically licensed for free to anyone and set up a system where they will only ever be enforced Against people who file lawsuits against people who join the consortium,

241
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:37,829
Scott: but the thing is those people who are filing lawsuits The patent trolls don't have anything.

242
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:40,699
Scott: They're not using any patents because they might.

243
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,256
Rym: you know The consortiums are large enough to where there's a good chance.

244
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:51,198
Rym: They are Also, you'd be very likely able to find a similar or almost identical patent in your own portfolio to hit back with.

245
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:56,900
Rym: maybe You could sue them for like using email to serve a notice about a patent.

246
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:18,480
Rym: So this article on slashdot and I don't want to get into all the details of what different states are doing But this is something that's been rumbling for a long long time There and there's a push and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is likely to announce soon Regulation requiring these devices in all cars and having penalties for disabling or removing them.

247
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:30,147
Rym: The device is being black boxes that in the event of a crash or other, you know an Incident where law enforcement gets involved could use a warrant to get the data and analyze as long as they had to use a warrant To get it.

248
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:31,060
Scott: What's the problem?

249
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:37,920
Rym: Let's forget the separate problem that pretty much anything involving technology doesn't need a warrant because our courts and legal system are so fucked.

250
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:42,240
Scott: Yeah, like how they was they ruled that like the FBI doesn't need a warrant to put a tracking device on your car.

251
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,760
Rym: Yeah, so let's ignore that problem because that's just an old people run Congress problem.

252
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:59,239
Rym: Okay independent of that the idea is that every car has to have a black box not one that phones home one that just records the data and Only keeps data from the moment of an accident back a certain amount of time.

253
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:03,180
Rym: You know telemetry data whether or not the gas pedal was hit or not?

254
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,459
Rym: How far it was whether or not the brakes were engaged how hard and when?

255
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:07,724
Scott: Whether or not people.

256
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:11,160
Scott: you gotta put them in police cars, that's definitely a good no question idea.

257
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:22,032
Rym: Yeah so the idea is to make it illegal to remove these devices and to put them in every single car and I am so Absolutely for this that I'm giddy.

258
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:23,138
Scott: It's a great idea.

259
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:31,100
Rym: point the first I Have never caused a traffic accident, but I have been involved in track win one traffic accident.

260
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:38,319
Rym: Actually, I was rear-ended like five times in high school But that was all in the high school parking lot because people would run stop signs behind me while I was stopped at them.

261
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:47,600
Rym: But I'm confident that if I'm ever driving in my entire life and there are black boxes in the cars I will be able to prove in court that the accident was not my fault.

262
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:52,743
Rym: Yep, - if we can prove that Who is at fault?

263
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:58,940
Rym: We can much better distribute the cost of recovering from traffic accidents, right?

264
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:06,356
Scott: Like if the black, you know right now we already have even without these black boxes Really excellent science to determine who was at fault.

265
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:30,120
Scott: accidents cops there are cops who specialize in this and they go there are detectives and they go down and they measure the skid marks on the Road and they look at the tires on the car Yeah and they look at how much damage is done to the car and nearby objects and they can pretty much 90% like exactly tell you what happened when how fast they were going when they hit the brake where the car what position it Was in when they hit the brake everything and that's without the black box.

266
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,055
Scott: If they had the black box, it's just like boom set in stone.

267
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:34,577
Scott: your fault.

268
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:35,160
Scott: You did it.

269
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,776
Scott: You were you know holding this gas pedal all the way down ignoring the red light.

270
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:41,689
Rym: So point the third I can't find the article.

271
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,280
Rym: So you'll have to take my word at this, but I'm sure you could find it.

272
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:55,420
Rym: I read an article it was years ago talking about how the vast majority as in the vast majority It was like over 90% of traffic collisions in the US where driver error and nothing else.

273
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,700
Rym: Of course driver error is pretty much the cause of almost every fatality on US highways.

274
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:11,839
Rym: Of course, and if we could prove who was at fault, then we could really in the long run Redistribute the cost of car insurance to the people who are causing the accidents.

275
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,470
Scott: Mmm, I guess yeah.

276
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:16,992
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,960
Scott: The thing is is that really gonna happen though?

278
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,782
Rym: I think it would in the long run.

279
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:29,677
Rym: because so right now let's say I'm involved in accident with you on the freeway and Your fault because there are no There's no like.

280
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:37,977
Rym: like the police can't clearly say who was at fault So they spread the blame 50/50 or 60/40 or something the insurance companies know All right, 60/40 and they base their metrics on that.

281
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:39,622
Rym: What if the metrics can prove?

282
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:48,370
Rym: Absolutely was rims fault 100% Mmm, then the insurance companies can much more heavily punish me in terms of premiums and not punish you at all.

283
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:49,819
Scott: That'd be fine.

284
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:58,710
Rym: Yeah I guess there's a lot of outrage from techies about this because they're afraid of government tracking and whatever And I don't know.

285
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:06,530
Rym: I'm just generally of the mind that certain kinds of surveillance and telemetry and tracking and things like this are very beneficial.

286
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:23,675
Rym: Not not from the angle of if you got nothing to hide, you know that sort of thing just from the angle of Every envisioning of an altercation I ever see myself engaged in Almost always involved someone else breaking the law or being adversarial or being at fault and me wishing I had some way to prove That fact in the court of law.

287
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:25,301
Scott: Well, isn't that exactly?

288
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:29,598
Scott: if you had nothing to hide you're basically saying I'm Rym I'm not breaking the law so I don't have anything to hide.

289
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,982
Rym: So what I'm saying is that because I have nothing to hide I Personally will make gather all this data and make it available.

290
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:42,785
Rym: if I was arrested for some sort of crime I would do anything to make sure like all that Google latitude data was in court for people to see.

291
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,749
Rym: Yeah, sure Unless I did it.

292
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:59,025
Rym: But especially because the people who are so worried about this they seem to think that the police are gonna start pulling you over and then Like checking the data to see if you were speeding earlier in the day.

293
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:11,227
Rym: Well, if you're black Or like a lot of people to this day claim that if you have an easy pass They will send you speeding tickets in the mail, which as far as I know has never happened.

294
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:11,990
Scott: They've never done that.

295
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:15,781
Scott: They'll send you drove through the toll booth without paying.

296
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,870
Rym: they'll also send you sped through the toll booth.

297
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:21,170
Rym: Yeah, you go through the toll booth at 80 miles an hour.

298
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,787
Rym: They're gonna send you a ticket for endangering the toll booth personnel.

299
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:26,140
Rym: Yep But anyway, I'm for this.

300
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,050
Rym: I see no reason not to do it.

301
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:37,630
Rym: So long as one you need a warrant to get the data unless the driver gives it up willingly Yep, and two they're not accessible from the outside.

302
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,410
Rym: They're a physical device that has to be accessed physically.

303
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,212
Scott: Yeah, yeah But what?

304
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:43,315
Scott: what keeps me from?

305
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:48,652
Scott: it has to also be secure enough so that the owner of the car can't tamper with it and modify The data.

306
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:49,857
Rym: Well, luckily that would be.

307
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:56,750
Rym: it'd be pretty easy to make something like that and to Having the laws such that I don't understand how it could be easy to do.

308
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,000
Scott: I mean, so it's how is it gonna check?

309
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,129
Scott: for example, how would it check the speed of the car?

310
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:03,863
Rym: How did cars currently check the speed?

311
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:04,769
Rym: You know how any of that works?

312
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,174
Scott: Yeah, it knows how.

313
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:09,043
Scott: how the dam the circumference of the wheels.

314
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:11,813
Scott: that's not how it does it and it knows how many times the Axis rotates.

315
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:26,190
Rym: Yeah, so one if you modify your car most likely from these articles There'll be laws saying that modifications to cars that would affect the telemetry gathering Have to also make sure that they update the telemetry gathering system properly and legally, right?

316
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,670
Scott: You're basically if the day there's no physical way to stop me from fucking with it.

317
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:39,810
Rym: Well from the data itself the black box It's really easy to make a physical device that if you mess with it It just it somehow notes that I've been messed with and nothing more.

318
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:42,785
Scott: No, but for example, right so it has some wires coming out of it.

319
00:22:42,825 --> 00:22:43,830
Scott: They connect to the speedometer.

320
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:48,470
Scott: Yeah, I can just cut those wires and attach them to a phony spin a thing that simulates the speedometer.

321
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:50,430
Scott: Yep, so it's always going to speed.

322
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:57,410
Rym: So in the investigation, you know You're in an accident or the police subpoena the data they physically go to get it and they discover the evidence of this tamper.

323
00:22:57,571 --> 00:23:00,509
Scott: I would obviously fix it before the cops got there.

324
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,709
Rym: Yeah, so you're in an accident and then you fix it right there.

325
00:23:04,392 --> 00:23:08,067
Scott: No more like, you know, it would obviously be some sort of clever system right.

326
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:14,068
Scott: for example Something I could plug in really quickly push a button and it would record it.

327
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:17,990
Scott: would you know Re-record a whole bunch of speedometer data and then I would unplug it and throw it in the woods.

328
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:22,689
Rym: So you're I'm dubious that you'd actually be able to set up something like that.

329
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:25,410
Scott: I don't see how you could stop me from doing something like that.

330
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:31,970
Rym: I don't think you could set one up that wouldn't be pretty eminently detectable from the extant evidence on the scene of a crime for example.

331
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,572
Scott: I don't know.

332
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:39,076
Rym: also by making it a crime to modify the device and Basically like making that illegal.

333
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,490
Scott: the thing is you basically even if even if it was detectable, right?

334
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:47,930
Scott: I can make it pretty hidden Like I could hide it behind like the the numbers on the speedometer or something like that, right?

335
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,889
Scott: So the cops would then be forced to like really take apart every piece of the car, you know to make sure.

336
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:58,926
Rym: It only matters if you're involved in a case where it did matter.

337
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:02,270
Rym: and now you've got intent You've got all this kind of premeditation.

338
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:08,030
Rym: So if you're caught for example, that is a much more serious crime than simply having broken the black.

339
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:09,817
Scott: But you're assuming if I'm caught this.

340
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:10,600
Scott: I'm so clever.

341
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,945
Scott: I'm actually I get off the hook.

342
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,190
Scott: Yeah, you're a hundred percent.

343
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:15,536
Rym: So so let's put it this way.

344
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:23,338
Rym: then one if your readings don't match up with what is seen in the other cars readings That's already a red flag.

345
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,191
Rym: the other car your car says I only drove 30.

346
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:26,915
Scott: Reasonable doubt.

347
00:24:26,935 --> 00:24:28,866
Scott: the other car was the one that tampered with the data.

348
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:32,281
Rym: actually no It's probably not because you can't because remember what.

349
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:34,570
Rym: you remember those detectives you talked about who are so good.

350
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:37,167
Rym: So they investigate the scene, huh?

351
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:45,370
Rym: Scott's box says that he'd never exceeded 31 miles per hour and yet his tires were worn bald and melted slightly.

352
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:46,628
Rym: And look at these skid marks.

353
00:24:48,774 --> 00:24:51,670
Rym: Oh and the other car matches perfectly with the extent data.

354
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:54,517
Scott: I could fuck with both cars.

355
00:24:54,638 --> 00:25:00,330
Rym: my easier argument that I was avoiding until now Is that if you're going to argue that we shouldn't do some sort of forensic technique?

356
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:08,237
Rym: Because our really clever criminal might get out of it so much for our entire legal system I'm just saying is that they would.

357
00:25:08,378 --> 00:25:11,972
Scott: I would be I would sell some sort of Devices.

358
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:19,030
Rym: we're gonna sell this online where the government can see it and then one no Buy your device and see how it works and know what to look for the same place.

359
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,296
Scott: They sell radar detectors and shit.

360
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:21,220
Rym: yeah radar detectors.

361
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,250
Rym: the police know exactly how radar detectors work.

362
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,615
Rym: I know and you know what.

363
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:27,246
Rym: they don't that well because everyone uses lidar.

364
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:28,270
Scott: radar detectors are shit.

365
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,170
Scott: But the point is that people buy radar detectors anyway, so people would buy my black box tamper.

366
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:36,103
Rym: Oh, you don't want to help the people you just want to make money.

367
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:39,676
Scott: No the people causing accidents I don't actually want to help them unless they're me.

368
00:25:39,696 --> 00:25:43,610
Scott: I just wanted to take their money by selling them hacking devices.

369
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:54,266
Rym: So anyway things of the day Got a thing of the day.

370
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,170
Scott: I do.

371
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,580
Scott: I got this this it's a it's an advertisement.

372
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,765
Scott: Well actually it's a movie trailer.

373
00:25:58,785 --> 00:26:00,191
Scott: Which is the same thing as an advertise.

374
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:02,460
Scott: really yeah green really?

375
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:03,546
Scott: So it's.

376
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:04,880
Scott: it's a romantic comedy movie.

377
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,769
Scott: But actually you know like there's probably not any romantic comedies that I could think of that I actually care about.

378
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:13,340
Rym: can you even name a rom-com?

379
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:16,320
Rym: This one name another one.

380
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:21,180
Rym: Nah you can't even name a single movie that you would call a romantic comedy.

381
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:23,606
Scott: Not one I mean you.

382
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:26,636
Scott: maybe you could mention the movie and I could tell you whether it was or wasn't.

383
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:28,020
Rym: would you consider say?

384
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,679
Rym: Pretty woman a romantic comedy, or is that something else?

385
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,976
Scott: Maybe have you ever seen pretty woman mm-hmm most of it.

386
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:35,920
Rym: Do you know what it's about?

387
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,822
Scott: horn Good.

388
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:41,596
Rym: Yeah, technically yeah, all right all right.

389
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:48,564
Rym: So Scott you're telling me that you think this movie a Romantic comedy.

390
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:53,140
Rym: I see a poster of a guy and a girl like walking through a forest.

391
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:54,603
Scott: Yeah, it's called.

392
00:26:54,684 --> 00:26:59,080
Scott: It's called dream with envy, but the trailer I guarantee you know it's like normally.

393
00:26:59,482 --> 00:27:01,691
Scott: You know you see trailers for these movies, and you're like whatever.

394
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:03,860
Scott: the trailer for this movie is so great.

395
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:13,600
Scott: It is so absolutely amazing that it will convince you to watch this movie Even if you are kind of like me and or like would never even consider watching it based on the poster.

396
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,149
Rym: God forgets girls anniversary.

397
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,635
Rym: That's the plot the trailer.

398
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:18,940
Rym: I'm reading the synopsis right now.

399
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,339
Scott: I guess girls anniversary.

400
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,517
Scott: I guarantee you that the trailer to this movie will make you want to watch the movie.

401
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:29,579
Scott: a hundred percent Guarantee if you trust me on ponies you have to trust me on this movie.

402
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:36,965
Rym: I Have seen the trailer, and I kind of do want to see the movie, but well, we'll see.

403
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,293
Rym: we'll see what you guys think This is.

404
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:40,399
Rym: this is an experiment.

405
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:42,409
Rym: We'll see what people have to say about that.

406
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:47,346
Rym: So my thing of the day is a man that Scott probably has never heard of.

407
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:48,169
Scott: I know who it is.

408
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,999
Rym: Do you know what is George Takei famous for Star Trek?

409
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:52,143
Rym: Oh wow really?

410
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:52,625
Rym: I don't.

411
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:54,090
Rym: so who'd he play in Star Trek?

412
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,623
Scott: The Asian guy with the blue uniform.

413
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:58,568
Rym: Do you know the guy's name?

414
00:27:58,588 --> 00:27:58,629
Rym: or?

415
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,874
Scott: What is George Takei?

416
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:01,857
Rym: or what is what?

417
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:04,726
Rym: what his position was on the bridge token Asian guy?

418
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:05,829
Rym: was he even on the bridge?

419
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:11,039
Scott: Duh George Washington bridge which Star Trek is he from?

420
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,635
Rym: the first one the first one the first first one the oldest Possible one you're sure.

421
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:17,738
Scott: I'm guessing.

422
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:28,531
Rym: yeah, okay anyway, so George Takei is Pretty famous for being a gay activist among other things you know actor and whatnot also being gay and for being Cuz.

423
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:32,630
Rym: you could be a gay activist without being gay for being a generally funny, dude.

424
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,921
Rym: And he is you know he's also got.

425
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:36,630
Scott: he also has like the bestest voice.

426
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:39,013
Rym: He has a really good radio voice And he it's.

427
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:39,516
Scott: he's like.

428
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:42,250
Scott: he's just like Peter Fernandez where he still has it even though he's old yep.

429
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,988
Rym: And he has the radio voice even when he's not radio.

430
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:45,289
Rym: miked.

431
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:49,343
Rym: I mean Scott and I could have radio voices on GeekNights, but in real life.

432
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:56,968
Rym: We don't have radio voices and even in GeekNights We don't really have radio voices cuz we don't really like work at doing the microphone technique Just because it's pain in the ass to do that.

433
00:28:57,952 --> 00:28:59,844
Rym: but he really in real life sounds like that.

434
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:15,370
Rym: and Basically Tennessee if you couldn't you know guess wasn't a state that may be a little bit homophobic And they tried to pass a law that basically well They are passing a law that doesn't let you talk about gayness in schools, okay?

435
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,729
Scott: What if you need to talk about history and there happens to be gayness in the history can't bring it up?

436
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,210
Scott: What if it's part of the curriculum?

437
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,910
Scott: Can't be part of the curriculum whether there's a national standardized test that asks about that history that involves gayness?

438
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:33,210
Rym: Oh, are you implying that perhaps students in Tennessee are not getting the best education compared to people in other states?

439
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,215
Scott: I don't think I'm implying.

440
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,883
Scott: I'm straight-up saying so.

441
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:43,207
Rym: George Takei is Basically campaigning against this and other things like it on the internet very funnily and I highly recommend you.

442
00:29:43,227 --> 00:29:45,113
Scott: just it's hard to take It seriously.

443
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:49,130
Rym: seek out YouTube videos and things related to George Takei because he's a pretty cool guy.

444
00:29:49,752 --> 00:29:51,537
Rym: To quote Wikipedia about him.

445
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:57,877
Rym: in November 2010 George Takei released a PSA blasting former Arkansas school board member Clint McCants.

446
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:05,695
Rym: in the video Takei repeatedly called mr.. McClants quotes a douchebag And it it's good stuff.

447
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:07,420
Rym: George Takei is a pretty cool.

448
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:07,741
Rym: Dude.

449
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:16,730
Rym: Maybe not as cool as the four horsemen, but So in the meta moment frosted tips and visors aside the book club book is still Isaac Asimov's foundation.

450
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:17,999
Rym: We'll get to it when we get to it.

451
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:19,490
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX Prime.

452
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,359
Rym: We might be a PAX dev doing a bunch of stuff.

453
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,430
Scott: ConnectiCon ConnectiCon is upcoming.

454
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:27,050
Rym: It's pretty much mostly too late for you to submit your panels.

455
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,037
Rym: Yes, I'm in the midst of scheduling them.

456
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:31,686
Scott: nerd NYC recesses on Saturday, June 18th.

457
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:37,027
Scott: Yep Saturday June 25th and 26 is game hack day in New York City.

458
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:37,610
Scott: How you like that?

459
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:38,972
Rym: Oh, I was.

460
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:39,454
Rym: you have any.

461
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:41,805
Scott: if you have any game programming or hacking skills.

462
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:42,970
Scott: You should be interested.

463
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:44,735
Rym: So what do you do with this event?

464
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:48,286
Scott: hex games and it's basically the way hack days tend to work.

465
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:48,848
Scott: is you?

466
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:56,030
Scott: you show up And maybe you have a team And you make a hack you make something and then the day two is usually presenting.

467
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,981
Scott: Uh-huh, and that's that's how the hack days tend to be structured.

468
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:15,736
Scott: Usually they're things where You know VCS come like this weekend competing with bar camp There was like tech crunch disrupt hack day And you know it's basically the VCS want you to make something so they can see if someone makes the best stuff and then they can try to convince them to Start up crap.

469
00:31:15,796 --> 00:31:23,070
Scott: right, but it is game hack day So I imagine it will be less of that kind of bullshit and more making cool games that are quirky and awesome.

470
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:27,603
Rym: And of course follow us on Twitter join the forum go to the website forums.

471
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:28,064
Rym: Awesome.

472
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:29,187
Rym: People are hanging out in there.

473
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:32,232
Scott: Yep Not much of the other meta going on.

474
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:32,733
Scott: Not really.

475
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:33,894
Scott: It's slow meta times.

476
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:37,778
Rym: So this week instead of doing work.

477
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:41,107
Rym: I'm Taking a Python boot camp for the week.

478
00:31:41,588 --> 00:31:43,715
Rym: All right, it's actually pretty good.

479
00:31:44,397 --> 00:31:45,200
Scott: Have you learned anything?

480
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,009
Rym: I've learned a lot of Python.

481
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:47,934
Scott: Do any skills?

482
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:49,000
Rym: I'm getting there.

483
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,869
Rym: I actually already in the course of the class.

484
00:31:50,909 --> 00:32:04,804
Rym: just you know, because there's a lot of free time during classes I wrote a pretty simple rules engine this multi-threaded app That'll take SNMP traps in and send formatted emails out based on set of arbitrary rules And I'm working on a web interface for that thing now.

485
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:05,586
Scott: Uh-huh.

486
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:08,593
Rym: Yeah, it's really easy to program.

487
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:09,115
Scott: Is it done?

488
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:10,819
Rym: Well, it's done.

489
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,465
Rym: Okay I'm not a great coder.

490
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:18,143
Scott: Yeah, the thing is it's like if you really what if anyone out there actually wants to learn Python You can just take.

491
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:23,525
Scott: I was telling some people this today and I've told other people in the past you can just take Classes online for free.

492
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:32,253
Scott: Well, you can go to MIT open courseware and take CS 101 at MIT Which happens to involve Python and you'll learn a whole lot.

493
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:38,800
Scott: if you take that class and you know all the material from that Class, you know more than most people who actually are hired as programmers.

494
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,413
Scott: Only that's only CS 101 at MIT.

495
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:48,820
Scott: So if you actually go to MIT you get three more years of that which is one two, three four five six seven more semesters.

496
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,420
Scott: You know what else you can do 1/8 of the MIT education.

497
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,440
Rym: You can buy an O'Reilly book and read it and do the stuff in it and learn Python.

498
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:59,220
Scott: Yeah, but you know, then you just learn a language, right?

499
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:05,640
Rym: It depends, for example the learning Python book which they sent me a copy of just in course the training so I have it.

500
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:11,167
Rym: I was reading it Actually does teach concepts More than it teaches language.

501
00:33:11,428 --> 00:33:13,354
Scott: Yeah, but the CS 101 at MIT is gonna teach you, you know.

502
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:30,940
Rym: Yeah, well, I guess the O'Reilly book is more for someone really who already knows Programming concepts just needs to learn the language or isn't great at programming but already know like as long as you know Like what objects are and inheritance and like the basic concepts of programming?

503
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:47,389
Rym: but the point is what bothers me is that Most training like for example this class I'm taking it and I'm you know I'm Fixing all my Python knowledge like I'm filling in all the holes that I had because I kind of just learned it ad hoc as I Had to write stuff out of necessity in the course of my life.

504
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:53,017
Rym: The only language I knew really well was let's see Perl because I had to use it a lot of work.

505
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,189
Rym: bash Yeah bash because I had more than anything said.

506
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:58,798
Rym: an awk because I use those almost more than anything except bash.

507
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,872
Rym: and Basic because that was the working language in the IT department.

508
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:07,917
Rym: basic is so brain-dead anyone can do it I know and C sharp because I had to write a bunch of soap services.

509
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:12,797
Rym: So Python was kind of on the back burner, even though it's actually my preferred language.

510
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,275
Rym: Like I like it I enjoy using it more than every other language.

511
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:15,538
Rym: I know.

512
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,714
Rym: Yet I wasn't that good at it because I don't get a chance to use it that often.

513
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:21,159
Rym: so I wanted to learn it better.

514
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:27,420
Rym: I could have just spent a week Coding stuff and read through O'Reilly books and I would have learned the same stuff.

515
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,320
Scott: You could have spent I don't know how many how many lectures there are in the MIT open course.

516
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:44,181
Scott: we could have done to a day and then done the you know, the Done the lessons involved and taking the tests and then in cut in the time in between those lessons Just worked on a project using the knowledge You just learned.

517
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:50,184
Rym: so the trouble is it is very difficult in the modern world Especially in the US.

518
00:34:50,364 --> 00:35:02,425
Rym: if you work for a company and they want you to learn a skill for the company For them to agree to say all right take a week off and we'll pay you and learn it or Come into the office for a week.

519
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:04,653
Rym: Don't do your normal work and learn this thing.

520
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:06,720
Rym: very few companies let people do that.

521
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,400
Scott: Well, I think the reason is is that you know, we are self learners, right?

522
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,618
Scott: I can just learn something, you know, and the other thing is right.

523
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:18,136
Scott: Why do you even need to take time off the job to learn a thing?

524
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:18,397
Scott: Right?

525
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:24,400
Rym: So for example Here's the good example in my job For example, their production thing could happen and I'm the senior engineer.

526
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:27,600
Rym: So if there's a serious problem, they would want to get me involved.

527
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:33,280
Rym: So if I'm in the office very often, whatever I'm learning or working on will be interrupted several times per day.

528
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,324
Scott: No, that's not what I'm asking.

529
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,748
Scott: What I'm asking is right.

530
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:39,642
Scott: so I needed I was doing a job once right and I need to do Some Ruby.

531
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:43,520
Scott: so it's not like I stopped to learn Ruby or I went to Ruby training.

532
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:44,506
Scott: I just was.

533
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:46,479
Scott: I. I was needed to do this work.

534
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:52,085
Scott: So I started doing the work and learn the Ruby simultaneous to doing the thing I needed to learn Ruby for.

535
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:53,530
Rym: Ah, you want to know why?

536
00:35:53,550 --> 00:36:00,120
Scott: If you need Python for something at work Just start working on that thing and learn the Python as you do the thing.

537
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,467
Rym: No, because Scott you want to know why?

538
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:05,600
Rym: Unless you're actually a developer in a large company Like you're actually like your job is developer.

539
00:36:06,282 --> 00:36:13,480
Rym: No one ever budgets time to even make stuff with any reasonable amount of time to make stuff let alone learn stuff.

540
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:23,620
Rym: So say you have to be learning is simultaneous at the making now because say you have to make a thing they'll budget it Assuming that you'll make it immediately and quickly with tools you already have.

541
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,763
Rym: So as a result like say I could like and say there's a huge thing I got to do.

542
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:28,770
Rym: I got to parse a bunch of data.

543
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:36,371
Rym: I could do it shoddily and bash really quickly But I could do it much better and make an extensible thing.

544
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,800
Rym: that would then be very useful down the road in Python.

545
00:36:39,302 --> 00:36:46,700
Rym: But if I'm not super up on my Python it would take me maybe an extra day's worth of work to do it in Python Because I'd have to reference a lot of materials.

546
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,970
Rym: I mean, I don't need to look anything up.

547
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,015
Rym: if I'm writing a giant bash script I have to occasionally look things up when I'm working in Python.

548
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:52,980
Rym: Like how's that module work?

549
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,008
Scott: I have to look things up no matter what I'm using.

550
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,536
Rym: Yeah, but I have to look things up more.

551
00:36:56,857 --> 00:36:57,420
Rym: I'm slower.

552
00:36:57,761 --> 00:36:59,991
Rym: I'll forget like all right the iter items.

553
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,939
Rym: That's how you go through a dictionary and stuff like that.

554
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:17,222
Rym: so as a result very rarely do you have the opportunity to do anything where you'll also learn because By nature learning and doing at the same time is slightly slower Than doing shiddily with something you already know, even if what you do ends up being a worse thing Mm-hmm.

555
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:24,334
Rym: So unless you're a developer most companies will really never actually give you the opportunity To learn anything for real.

556
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:32,099
Rym: also I will argue that if you learn only by doing like oh, you've got to do that Like, uh, there's an example from my job.

557
00:37:32,602 --> 00:37:41,056
Rym: there's a guy and we have to make a thing like a script basically and Say this guy does it in Perl or Python, which he doesn't know.

558
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:46,395
Rym: and alright He'll learn Perl or Python as he's making the thing, you know, he'll make the thing.

559
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:47,820
Rym: He'll learn the language at the same time.

560
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,523
Rym: yep, as a result what comes out is Very poorly written.

561
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:56,370
Rym: Yeah, and doesn't work that well and crashes.

562
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:57,393
Scott: Does it get the job done?

563
00:37:57,854 --> 00:37:58,215
Rym: Barely.

564
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,300
Scott: Yeah, is it satisfactory?

565
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,400
Scott: Does it meet the requirement?

566
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:05,160
Rym: Yes, except that no one else could ever interface with it when I looked at it.

567
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,980
Scott: But is that is interfacing with a part of the requirement?

568
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,400
Rym: I hope he doesn't listen to this show, but is interfacing with it part of the requirement?

569
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:16,871
Rym: Well, no, they don't write requirement documents because people aren't Scott in the real world unless you're a developer.

570
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:18,499
Rym: Nobody ever gives you a requirements.

571
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,865
Scott: now I'm not saying does it meet?

572
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:21,351
Scott: and that doesn't have to be a document.

573
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:22,154
Scott: No, there's still.

574
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,967
Rym: there's an unwritten requirement Yes, but the unwritten requirements are.

575
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:29,457
Rym: it did the job and not things like without crashing or really?

576
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,966
Scott: That's not part of the unwritten requirement.

577
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:34,073
Scott: not crashing because I'm pretty in my in my eyes.

578
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:36,340
Scott: not crashing as part of the unwritten requirement?

579
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,240
Scott: Yeah, well because if it crashes you fail.

580
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:51,140
Rym: That's what happens when a non developer who doesn't know object oriented principles and doesn't really know programming languages is writing something in Perl And basically, wow, you're iterating through like ten nested arrays.

581
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:53,807
Scott: Okay, welcome here.

582
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:55,011
Rym: Here's a data dictionary.

583
00:38:55,072 --> 00:39:19,992
Rym: do it that way instead, but basically If people who learn by doing who don't already know all the fundamentals will often learn very bad habits by taking a class or by training as you know, like budgeting in a project like alright a week of like a Django boot camp and then beginning the requirements building for this Django website The company has to build it's probably gonna be more fruitful for a group of developers.

584
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:22,507
Rym: then build this and learn it all at the same time.

585
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:24,824
Scott: Now here's the other thing right.

586
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:31,957
Scott: if you know training is all you really need to go from don't know what to do to be Able to do to the work right and how long is the training?

587
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:32,219
Scott: a week?

588
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:41,620
Rym: Yeah, this is a boot camp that basically is aimed at alright You're already a programmer and then in the by the end of this week, you will be a pretty average Python developer.

589
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:45,899
Scott: So why the fuck does anyone need to go to school for four years if they can go to boot camp for a week?

590
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:57,280
Rym: You want to know why because in in these training things like this at least all the enterprise ones I've been to that are about programming languages They assume that you already know all the fundamentals of computer science.

591
00:39:58,122 --> 00:40:04,380
Rym: If you don't know about like iterations and flow control and data structures and all that stuff you're fucked.

592
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:08,260
Scott: But couldn't they then teach you that in a one-week boot camp as well?

593
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:09,022
Scott: I don't know.

594
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:12,253
Scott: you could learn that in less than four years enough to take the thing.

595
00:40:12,273 --> 00:40:12,835
Scott: That's for sure.

596
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,120
Rym: Yeah, you probably could.

597
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:16,740
Scott: So it's like, you know, what's the point?

598
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:24,020
Scott: You know if people can just if training is enough for companies to be willing to let you do something then why do they?

599
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:26,027
Scott: You know, what was the four years of college?

600
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:26,468
Rym: It's got.

601
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:27,352
Rym: why'd you go to our IT?

602
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,740
Scott: for the reasons besides education?

603
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,428
Rym: Yeah, that's why I went to our IT.

604
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:33,540
Rym: Yeah, here's the real benefits of college.

605
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:35,871
Rym: You have access to the stuff to the materials.

606
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,699
Rym: You need to actually learn if you want to learn.

607
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:48,937
Rym: You meet all the people who will eventually get you jobs and you get a piece of paper and you have your fun And you have and there's actually, you know, there are chances to become a professor.

608
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:49,981
Scott: or you know Do?

609
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:54,520
Scott: there are certain things that you can't do without the advanced learning of the college.

610
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,380
Scott: But if you if you want to do those things, well, you know like be a doctor.

611
00:40:58,561 --> 00:41:17,813
Rym: let's narrow the discussion a little bit because basically When you think of corporate training like training like alright, I work here I'm going to technology training for a week or two to learn X or learn Y. or you know Very rarely are classes like that Fundamentals like learn object-oriented programming or learn conceptual design.

612
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:18,234
Rym: They're always.

613
00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:18,716
Rym: they're always.

614
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:29,999
Rym: learn this specific product Yep, or learn this specific Acronym learn this tool and I think the the understanding is that in the industry you should already know the fundamentals you.

615
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:34,220
Rym: This is kind of training like alright, you need to learn this specific thing quickly.

616
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,853
Rym: We're gonna teach you the best practices and then you'll be good to go.

617
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,979
Rym: You won't learn bad practices You won't go off in the wrong direction.

618
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:59,040
Rym: But really I'm starting to feel pretty strongly that the majority of corporate style IT training is Bullshit, no It's only there because companies aren't willing to budget the time or trust their employees to learn on their own to learn stuff.

619
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:02,833
Scott: Well, I think this is training Me this.

620
00:42:02,873 --> 00:42:13,818
Rym: if they've just said if they just said Alright, you don't have to work on anything, but learning Python really well and writing some apps this week I would have gotten the same out of it as this multi-thousand-dollar course.

621
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:18,740
Scott: We both know that either one of us can learn on our own if we want to right everyone.

622
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:20,312
Scott: I know other people.

623
00:42:20,473 --> 00:42:21,360
Scott: can they do so?

624
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,858
Scott: Would you trust some strange guy that you hired that you only know through work and you've only got one ago?

625
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:33,896
Rym: I would not hire someone that I would not trust to learn on their own unless they were doing menial work in which case I Would never let them get training.

626
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:39,140
Rym: Because the thing is it's funny if you actually go to these training things.

627
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,159
Rym: Have you ever gone to like?

628
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,460
Rym: Corporate like a week or two training like out and not a week or two.

629
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,380
Scott: But I've gone to you know, like individual one-day classes things and they were always boring and useless.

630
00:42:49,826 --> 00:42:54,456
Rym: so in those cases How many of the people who are in the class with you clearly didn't want to be there and weren't?

631
00:42:54,476 --> 00:42:56,389
Rym: they were just surfing the net The whole time and not paying attention.

632
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,357
Scott: the vast majority.

633
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:07,019
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so if you give someone if you let someone come into the office and learn on their own It's a lot easier to kind of notice if they're actually learning or not.

634
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:16,652
Rym: Then if you send them flying off to Vegas for a week to go to a class where you can't keep an eye on them And that cost thousands of dollars more and probably has the same effect nothing.

635
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:19,582
Rym: I Just I'm.

636
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:22,198
Rym: I'm kind of sick of corporate training as a thing.

637
00:43:23,163 --> 00:43:27,360
Scott: Well, I mean there are times when corporate training could be the real deal, right?

638
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:42,400
Scott: I mean it depends on exactly what you're being trained in like let's say, you know Like you go work at a job and and there's a machine involved and it's a very, you know Specific machine like some sort of manufacturing robot or something like that and it's got all sorts of crazy controls.

639
00:43:42,882 --> 00:43:44,467
Scott: Well, you're gonna pay fucking attention.

640
00:43:44,507 --> 00:43:48,120
Scott: that training so the robot doesn't like rip your arm off true, right?

641
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,319
Rym: You know at the same time that's operational training as opposed to development training.

642
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:54,780
Rym: There are very different things you think is different.

643
00:43:54,993 --> 00:43:55,783
Rym: Yeah like for example.

644
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:56,867
Rym: think here's the difference between.

645
00:43:56,887 --> 00:44:03,269
Rym: there's training like say that you want to teach someone how to Manage a clustered Linux environment.

646
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,000
Rym: That's very different from teaching someone how to design a clustered Linux environment.

647
00:44:08,462 --> 00:44:08,743
Rym: I mean it.

648
00:44:08,784 --> 00:44:10,168
Rym: they're very different skill sets.

649
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:11,312
Scott: That's true.

650
00:44:11,754 --> 00:44:13,500
Rym: So that's like or a factory.

651
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:23,675
Rym: It's very different to teach someone how to operate the machine that pushes the widget in Versus troubleshoot the machine that pushes the widget in or build the machine that pushes the which.

652
00:44:23,696 --> 00:44:29,096
Scott: but usually there would be like You know a document that tells you how to troubleshoot the machine like you get a copy machine and it's like it.

653
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,645
Scott: did this error Appear look at find it in this book.

654
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,932
Scott: follow these instructions, you know, what happened?

655
00:44:34,012 --> 00:44:34,895
Scott: my turn to this page.

656
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:35,677
Scott: follow these instructions.

657
00:44:35,697 --> 00:44:48,820
Rym: my experience In all my years of enterprise IT that instruction book for every printer in the world says the following Stand around looking at it poke at it a few times call the company and pay them to have someone come in and fix it.

658
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,807
Scott: No, it's already already.

659
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:52,128
Scott: Don't forget.

660
00:44:52,168 --> 00:44:53,313
Rym: Don't forget the very important step.

661
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:59,271
Rym: roll it out and look at the back Ineffectually for like 10 minutes already paid for the service contract.

662
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:01,457
Scott: So call them without even poking it at all.

663
00:45:01,638 --> 00:45:04,206
Rym: Yep That's a separate thing.

664
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,840
Rym: nobody in the goddamn world knows how to use their fancy printers.

665
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,746
Scott: But like if I was a company I would actually just buy those fancy printers straight up instead of getting there Easy to administer.

666
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:15,779
Scott: Yeah and fix and plus I'd buy the high-quality ones.

667
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:18,470
Rym: Yeah, cuz they're great, but no one knows how to use them.

668
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:20,457
Rym: I mean I print stuff double-sided.

669
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:24,657
Scott: It's like wizardry colors double-side folding binding.

670
00:45:24,677 --> 00:45:26,985
Scott: Oh Collating and sorting.

671
00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:29,838
Rym: actually ours doesn't collate or staple or any of that stuff.

672
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,695
Scott: Yeah We don't really need any of that cuz I don't print.

673
00:45:31,715 --> 00:45:31,816
Rym: that.

674
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:37,683
Rym: in fact The only time I print is stupid like metric reports for people that I don't really care about I don't have.

675
00:45:37,723 --> 00:45:39,069
Rym: my job became crystal reports.

676
00:45:39,411 --> 00:45:39,812
Scott: I don't print.

677
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:46,840
Scott: I Wouldn't print if I didn't have to generate crystal reports for people and they need him print it out that you get his email them.

678
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,524
Rym: Yeah, don't get.

679
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:51,860
Scott: why don't they get some crystal reports training and then they could do it themselves?

680
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,324
Rym: Yeah, they want.

681
00:45:53,445 --> 00:45:56,035
Rym: I wanted crystal reports training, but they didn't give it to me.

682
00:45:56,096 --> 00:45:57,664
Rym: So I just Did it.

683
00:45:57,684 --> 00:45:59,379
Rym: I just learned how to use it cuz it's not that hard.

684
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,074
Scott: You just learned how to use it on your own.

685
00:46:02,115 --> 00:46:05,067
Rym: That's impossible Ah, but it took like four hours to make reports.

686
00:46:05,107 --> 00:46:06,551
Scott: cuz crystal report sucks.

687
00:46:06,872 --> 00:46:09,359
Rym: No, but I can't think of a better tool SQL.

688
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:17,858
Rym: Yeah, you're gonna make pretty fancy multi-dimensional graphs that actually do show data correlations just with SQL.

689
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:19,888
Scott: well No, I do the SQL.

690
00:46:20,049 --> 00:46:24,953
Scott: then I would take the data that came from the query Yeah into the Excel and then use that to make the fancy charts.

691
00:46:25,134 --> 00:46:26,419
Rym: Yeah, Excel makes shit charts.

692
00:46:26,802 --> 00:46:28,878
Rym: No, you think so and for that kind of stuff.

693
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,173
Rym: Yeah I'll show you one of my charts.

694
00:46:31,314 --> 00:46:31,940
Rym: I'll show you what I did.

695
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,804
Rym: They're actually pretty good.

696
00:46:32,844 --> 00:46:34,190
Rym: But that's that's a separate discussion.

697
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,340
Rym: We should do a show on like data mining.

698
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,169
Scott: I think I don't know enough about data.

699
00:46:38,189 --> 00:46:47,195
Rym: my really I do a lot of data mining Anyway, but I think you can actually split corporate training into you know, forget operational or whatever.

700
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:56,826
Rym: the real classes of it I think are classes that teach someone who already knows basic IT skills or CS skills a Specific tool to do something like.

701
00:46:57,207 --> 00:46:58,391
Rym: you're already an IT guy.

702
00:46:58,631 --> 00:47:00,076
Rym: Here's how to use red hat clustering.

703
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:02,422
Rym: Here's how to use the RBD Mm-hmm.

704
00:47:02,462 --> 00:47:04,212
Rym: I think that kind of training is actually really useful.

705
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:05,720
Scott: I could use that the RBD trading.

706
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:06,880
Rym: I did a class on that.

707
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,319
Rym: We had a guy come in and teach us postgres and the RBD together like how to do that.

708
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:16,220
Rym: It was very focused and everyone knew what they were doing was like, alright, you want to do something like this?

709
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,147
Rym: Here's exactly how to do it how it works how to troubleshoot it.

710
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:20,109
Rym: We're done.

711
00:47:20,149 --> 00:47:20,871
Rym: got any questions.

712
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:27,819
Scott: I Once that was like, you know, there's a new version of X coming out.

713
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:30,230
Scott: Here are the things that have changed in this new version.

714
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,896
Scott: right good what?

715
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:32,760
Scott: and any questions?

716
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,840
Scott: And by the way, I'm the guy who made this thing.

717
00:47:35,601 --> 00:47:38,831
Rym: But then there are the enterprise tool classes like.

718
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:41,440
Rym: you bought this fancy enterprise monitoring system.

719
00:47:41,781 --> 00:47:43,387
Rym: Here is the training that you bought.

720
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:47,328
Rym: that cost like ten thousand dollars to teach three of your employees how to use this piece of shit.

721
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:49,965
Rym: Every kind of training like that.

722
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:54,140
Rym: I've ever been to in all my years of IT has been absolutely worthless.

723
00:47:54,603 --> 00:48:00,231
Scott: Yeah, I wish there was a way to like, you know Figure out before you get the training like if it's worthless or not.

724
00:48:00,492 --> 00:48:02,540
Rym: I think it's really easy case in point.

725
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,543
Rym: Here's this how I do it.

726
00:48:03,744 --> 00:48:04,947
Rym: one is the training.

727
00:48:04,988 --> 00:48:07,134
Scott: it is a training review site or something like that.

728
00:48:07,255 --> 00:48:10,868
Rym: is the training for a Proprietary enterprise product?

729
00:48:11,049 --> 00:48:12,498
Rym: if yes training will be stupid.

730
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:16,130
Rym: I'm pretty sure that is without exception.

731
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:18,020
Scott: But the thing is a prize or enterprise product.

732
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,753
Scott: How can you learn how to use it without the training?

733
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:22,262
Rym: It's not like yeah And you know what the answer is.

734
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:24,746
Rym: nobody knows how to use it not even the trainer.

735
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,150
Rym: no no no I went to.

736
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,764
Rym: So service desk Express put up by BMC.

737
00:48:30,804 --> 00:48:38,039
Rym: I'll call out their stupid names because whatever I hate them so much is possibly one of the worst ticketing systems in the world.

738
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:41,870
Rym: and The training basically the manuals useless.

739
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,960
Rym: It doesn't actually tell you how to use the product like half the stuff.

740
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:50,440
Rym: It tells you oh Here's how to do this won't actually work on any scale and it's inconsistent and things just don't work the way you expect.

741
00:48:50,902 --> 00:49:03,520
Rym: So you have to take training to learn how to use the product because the training Almost all enterprise training is aimed at the lowest common denominator Like they expect people who aren't super techies to be showing up to this training.

742
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:09,979
Rym: So the training starts on a level that is pointless baby talk and usually doesn't get much farther than okay.

743
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:10,982
Rym: You started it.

744
00:49:11,444 --> 00:49:14,093
Scott: click the X button to close the window.

745
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:27,599
Rym: Here's hot like and they always focus on very obtuse and Complicated parts of the software that no one cares about or will use and don't even talk about The very important things that aren't actually documented.

746
00:49:30,244 --> 00:49:46,370
Rym: Those things yeah, and the instructors usually don't know or They do know and the answer they give you is usually prefaced by yeah Well, this isn't in the documentation But here's how you really do it and it's something complete like BS like yeah The ASP and insert your JavaScript or whatever.

747
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:58,505
Rym: Oh, yeah go on the back end and do this database update And the classes always start late and early and just suck and cost Ludicrous amounts of money.

748
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:02,640
Scott: Well, I mean, you know some come one company's stupid willing to pay for training.

749
00:50:02,741 --> 00:50:04,149
Scott: Another company is gonna be smart.

750
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:08,833
Rym: Yeah, our jalopah training and you'll notice Many of the enterprise training I've been to.

751
00:50:09,316 --> 00:50:16,540
Rym: if you ever go to this stuff You'll see half the people there have been using the product for a long time and the product doesn't work anymore.

752
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:21,760
Rym: Or they have problems and they were sent by their management to the training to learn what they were doing wrong.

753
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:23,083
Scott: Why don't?

754
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:27,780
Scott: but the thing is, you know, if something is broken you don't call you don't get training you get support.

755
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:29,619
Rym: Oh enterprise support is useless.

756
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,460
Rym: I've never gotten good support from any enterprise level product ever.

757
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:40,703
Scott: I don't know if it's enterprise level but there have been times where I've gotten good support like you call Developers.

758
00:50:40,763 --> 00:50:43,012
Rym: on the other end Microsoft has pretty great support.

759
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:45,000
Scott: Microsoft does even Xbox support.

760
00:50:45,181 --> 00:50:48,173
Rym: It's a great Twiki wiki of all things actually has pretty good support.

761
00:50:48,434 --> 00:50:49,739
Scott: Like I've got an open source thing.

762
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:52,619
Scott: Nah, yeah, but sort of how do you get support for it?

763
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:59,542
Rym: There's there's Peter Tony and this other guy who are kind of like the main developers for it and you can post a bug and they'll Usually respond.

764
00:50:59,602 --> 00:51:02,353
Rym: I emailed them and they responded once like they answered my questions.

765
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:08,654
Rym: Okay, actually contracted one of them I forget which one for like 70 pounds to write a like replication plug-in for me.

766
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:09,316
Scott: No work.

767
00:51:09,738 --> 00:51:10,480
Rym: It did really well.

768
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,880
Rym: I eventually phased it out because there was a bug where one day our remote site wasn't available.

769
00:51:15,403 --> 00:51:20,066
Rym: So it replicated nothing to the local share Destroying the entire Twiki.

770
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:25,970
Rym: and then when the remote site came back up it said oh there have been changes And it updated the whole thing again.

771
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:28,000
Rym: and then no there were changes.

772
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:30,511
Rym: So it replicated the empty Twiki to the remote site.

773
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:32,399
Rym: Yeah, I had to restore the whole thing from tape.

774
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,663
Scott: Tape whoa.

775
00:51:34,764 --> 00:51:40,659
Scott: Yeah, you don't have like the reason you don't use tape for like the week old or at least month old But you got to keep the more recent ones on discs.

776
00:51:41,002 --> 00:51:43,740
Rym: Yeah, I guess it's very rare for me to need a backup of anything, right?

777
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,633
Scott: But the point is like you got to keep the recentest backups on something.

778
00:51:46,673 --> 00:51:47,195
Scott: that's fast.

779
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:48,160
Scott: So you otherwise tape.

780
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:48,442
Scott: It's.

781
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,740
Rym: yeah, it depends on how your tapes are set up.

782
00:51:51,961 --> 00:51:58,269
Rym: What tape is fast, uh, depending on your automated cartridge systems I have had really fast access to tapes.

783
00:51:58,309 --> 00:51:59,392
Rym: In fact at IBM.

784
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:06,020
Rym: We had a place where there was a robot a Gigantic robot that could fetch tapes with such speed that it was ludicrous.

785
00:52:06,735 --> 00:52:07,986
Scott: Yeah But the point is to read to.

786
00:52:08,026 --> 00:52:09,956
Scott: when you read a tape you have to read it straight through.

787
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:10,700
Scott: you can't scan.

788
00:52:11,102 --> 00:52:13,192
Scott: You need to read the whole tape from beginning to end usually.

789
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:14,860
Scott: Yeah, so that could be a pain.

790
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,028
Rym: Well, I won't get into the details.

791
00:52:16,048 --> 00:52:17,580
Rym: You want like ice it to style.

792
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,815
Rym: Enterprise training is mostly useless.

793
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:26,193
Rym: Yep You're better off hiring a consultant to teach you Cheaper how to use the product for real.

794
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,480
Rym: then you are getting official support.

795
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,079
Scott: Thing is I kind of want to you know.

796
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,033
Scott: Give training because I feel like I could give training on things.

797
00:52:32,113 --> 00:52:33,700
Scott: I know that's really good.

798
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:44,489
Rym: I would be pretty qualified to give training on some of these bullshit enterprise products Yeah, and judging from the consulting and I would kind of like doing that if it paid enough Yeah, get to travel a lot.

799
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:45,373
Rym: I think it could be fun.

800
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:53,420
Rym: Yeah, I Just the third kind of corporate training is the soft training like leadership or project management.

801
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,386
Scott: Bullshit, they're just so.

802
00:52:55,526 --> 00:52:56,008
Scott: space.

803
00:52:56,108 --> 00:52:57,775
Scott: leap to conclusions crap.

804
00:52:57,835 --> 00:52:59,020
Rym: The thing is they could be good.

805
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,472
Rym: I could imagine a class that teaches like project management.

806
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,640
Rym: That is like here's how to deal with sizing.

807
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,448
Rym: Here's not actually size an IT project.

808
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:09,300
Rym: Here's how budgeting really works and how to really do it.

809
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,634
Rym: Here's what you know as my experience 20 years being a project manager.

810
00:53:12,654 --> 00:53:14,020
Rym: Here are the things that you'll always fuck up.

811
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,328
Rym: Here's how you can avoid fucking.

812
00:53:15,348 --> 00:53:17,100
Scott: the main problem I have with things like that, right?

813
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:23,400
Scott: It's like somebody will teach you here's how to size a project right and they'll say take all these factors into account.

814
00:53:23,883 --> 00:53:25,314
Scott: Right, like you don't got to worry about this.

815
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:27,120
Scott: You got to worry about this You got to worry about this, right?

816
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:35,128
Scott: But they don't actually tell you like follow these this exact process to come up with the exact You know fit number that you're looking for.

817
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:38,220
Scott: They'll never give you that because it doesn't exist, right?

818
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,104
Scott: There's no such thing.

819
00:53:39,144 --> 00:53:41,956
Rym: So you want them to give you something that doesn't exist, right?

820
00:53:41,996 --> 00:53:42,980
Scott: But that's that's the point.

821
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,000
Scott: It's like they're basically telling you, you know, this sort of my criticism is much more general.

822
00:53:48,444 --> 00:53:50,420
Rym: I think there's a fundamental flaw in that kind of training.

823
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:59,319
Rym: I think the problem is and I noticed this first at RIT with the public speaking classes that I took Because I you know, I thought that'd be cool.

824
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:15,180
Rym: so I took a long class on public speaking and like oratory and rhetoric and By and large I found people who are drawn to classes that teach things like leadership or public speaking Tend to be terrible at leadership and public speaking and think that they can get better at it by taking a class.

825
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:27,232
Rym: so as a result classes like that tend to focus on things like Don't freak out if you're publicly speaking Don't stutter Don't like pee yourself on stage.

826
00:54:27,273 --> 00:54:31,820
Rym: You don't get the advanced topics You don't get the people who are like don't actually make eye contact.

827
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:41,016
Rym: But look at everyone's eyebrows and you know You know look at the audience like 45% of the time between back and forth or you know All the tricks that I actually know as a pretty expert public speaker.

828
00:54:41,037 --> 00:54:52,660
Scott: Yeah I mean there was this guy at bar camp this weekend and he was talking about how he's doing this sort of Collaborative training right where like his idea is that instead of having a trainer, right?

829
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,480
Scott: They still do have trainers and students.

830
00:54:54,821 --> 00:55:02,500
Scott: But basically his idea is get the students to teach each other right as opposed to having a teacher teach the class, right?

831
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:11,480
Scott: so people will show up and you'll give them a Real project to do and they have to team up and do the projects, you know and in doing so we'll learn.

832
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:14,655
Rym: I had a class like that actually during the Democratic primaries.

833
00:55:14,695 --> 00:55:15,037
Rym: while we're

834
00:55:15,057 --> 00:55:37,219
Scott: like, yeah So if you wanted to teach someone Python, for example with this method, it would be like, alright Everyone shows up and you'd be like, alright, here's what you guys have to make in Python team up together and Do it and in doing so and all working together on it You will all you know by the end of taking many classes over the course of many weeks Learn the Python because you just used it to do a thing.

835
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,448
Rym: So in the lead-up to the Democratic primaries.

836
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:48,117
Rym: for while we were at RIT way back, you know, John Kerry and all that I took a seminar a seminar on political theory and there are only like eight people in the class.

837
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:49,060
Rym: Gah, gah.

838
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:55,700
Rym: So the professor was like, alright, we'll do this as a straight-up seminar and he broke the quarter up.

839
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,315
Rym: You know ten weeks into eight units and at each student teach a unit.

840
00:56:00,896 --> 00:56:02,020
Scott: so easy for that teacher.

841
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:03,064
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

842
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:07,260
Rym: He sat in the audience and asked tough-ass motherfucking questions.

843
00:56:07,561 --> 00:56:12,277
Rym: Yeah, and that was possibly the most fun I had in all my time at our.

844
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:12,478
Scott: now.

845
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:18,200
Scott: see on paper That sounds like a good idea and I don't only works if everyone involved is motivated and intelligent.

846
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,380
Scott: Well, he did mention that a lot of people dropped out but the people who stayed were incredibly motivated actually would stay extra hours.

847
00:56:25,022 --> 00:56:35,018
Scott: Right, and you know, I definitely believe that people do it in taking this sort of class will learn a lot You know and will make you know, we'll definitely make some significant progress.

848
00:56:35,078 --> 00:56:37,865
Scott: The thing is Like just what you were saying.

849
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:44,379
Scott: the people who are in this thing are people who are way down low and at best it's gonna Bring them up to the middle level.

850
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,050
Rym: Mediating factor and instructor who guides.

851
00:56:48,211 --> 00:56:50,380
Scott: Yeah, but even with the instructor who guides right?

852
00:56:50,540 --> 00:57:01,819
Scott: It's like it's like you get people who are way down low mostly learning together with people who are way down low so they can Help each other, you know get to the finish line, but they're not gonna learn the ink.

853
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:14,399
Scott: You know, especially when it comes to technology there is this incredibly high-level Esoteric stuff no matter what you're doing that you're not gonna learn Scott The only way to learn that stuff in my opinion is to run into it doing real work.

854
00:57:14,961 --> 00:57:17,669
Rym: Two things one by having a classical education.

855
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:28,919
Rym: So you have just a wide variety of knowledge and experience from school Yeah, or just from life, you know, you can get a classical education without going to school Yeah, and two just by being around long enough to see enough shit

856
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:31,679
Scott: Yeah, but that's the thing is like, you know.

857
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:32,383
Rym: so that's the thing.

858
00:57:32,423 --> 00:57:41,360
Rym: people you people have misplaced expectations of training and I think the the reason they're misplaced is because they will see people who go to training and succeed.

859
00:57:42,161 --> 00:57:46,760
Rym: I think the people who succeed as a result of training in most cases didn't need the training to begin with.

860
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,919
Rym: Yeah, they're self motivated enough to where they would have learned it on their own if given the time.

861
00:57:50,211 --> 00:57:58,686
Rym: Yeah So the people who see that they have this mystical idea and you see this in colleges too that I don't know computers if I go To a computer school.

862
00:57:58,786 --> 00:58:05,639
Rym: I'll graduate being a computer expert Kind of like the tourists who think if I go to New York City, New York City will entertain me.

863
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:08,340
Rym: Yeah, I think that's exactly what happens.

864
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:19,840
Rym: They think that training is magical that if I go to training I will come out knowing everything not realizing that it takes Almost the exact same amount of effort to learn in a training class as it does to learn on your own.

865
00:58:20,243 --> 00:58:23,599
Rym: And if you don't have the motivation to you're not learn on your own You're not gonna do that.

866
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,687
Rym: Well in a class in most cases pretty

867
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:42,499
Scott: much the only thing the only value that I see in getting training Right as opposed to learn it on my own by doing or reading a book or both or internet or whatever Is that at the training you if the if the person giving the training is really an expert person Which is not always true.

868
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:56,420
Scott: But if they are really an expert person then you can ask them the questions that you know and get instant full answers You know with all the details fleshed out that you might not be able to get from say Stack Overflow or something like that.

869
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:13,395
Rym: Yep, like I had a question about because we're you know Python 3 versus 2 There are some differences and I had a question about one of the differences and the instructor who actually lectures if I can I can often was like oh and he basically had as Much depth as I wanted and there was probably a lot more there.

870
00:59:13,455 --> 00:59:27,448
Scott: if I wanted to go deeper I've also heard stories right of people going to things like Apple Developer conference or Microsoft equivalent of the same thing, you know, whatever they call it these days right or you know, Google's What do they call it?

871
00:59:27,528 --> 00:59:31,062
Scott: They just had it recently the Google I/o.

872
00:59:31,283 --> 00:59:53,360
Scott: right and you go if you go to those things and you have something that's really really niche like you go to Microsoft and you're writing some Windows app and You've got a problem with this really deep down Like Windows something API Call somewhere and the MSDN documentation isn't enough and no one on Stack Overflow is helping you.

873
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,189
Rym: So the guy who wrote that is right.

874
00:59:55,269 --> 00:59:56,314
Scott: It's not a training.

875
00:59:56,455 --> 00:59:57,560
Scott: It's a developer conference.

876
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:08,060
Scott: But if you go there, you're going to Microsoft you're going to Google or to Apple You can find the guy whose job it is for that thing and you can get the magical answer that you've been looking for.

877
01:00:08,545 --> 01:00:22,440
Scott: You know, it's not training But it's that it's in the same way that I think the value has the same value as training which is Direct access in person to the one or two people on earth who have the expert knowledge in the thing that you're looking for.

878
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:23,980
Scott: That is so specific, right?

879
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:35,660
Scott: So if it's a good trainer It almost doesn't matter if the training is worthless because if you have a problem You're basically paying those thousands whatever to get the answer to that question that you so desperately need.

880
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:39,260
Scott: So it's like, you know You can build up a whole list of questions if you get them all answered.

881
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:41,328
Scott: Look at the price and figure out if it was worth it.

882
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:43,437
Scott: Like would you have paid to get those hands?

883
01:00:43,517 --> 01:00:45,695
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I guess my thesis.

884
01:00:45,716 --> 01:00:51,740
Scott: but then again You could just do the same thing by hiring that trainer as a consultant for a day to ask him the questions.

885
01:00:52,242 --> 01:00:53,547
Rym: There's a blurred line between.

886
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:58,918
Rym: when you go to training vert like a lot of training places offer Hey, we'll just send the instructor to your company.

887
01:00:59,562 --> 01:01:04,079
Rym: However, many people you want to sit in the room can sit in the room and we'll do whatever you want me to do.

888
01:01:04,562 --> 01:01:06,814
Rym: Yeah, that's actually usually I think a great idea.

889
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:07,880
Scott: it's the same thing as a consultant.

890
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:09,092
Rym: Oh, it is a concern.

891
01:01:09,112 --> 01:01:09,940
Scott: you're hiring consultant.

892
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,594
Scott: You can tell that consultant to do work or you can tell them to.

893
01:01:12,695 --> 01:01:14,589
Scott: you can just ask them questions Or you could have them trained.

894
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:15,599
Scott: you could have them do whatever you want.

895
01:01:15,761 --> 01:01:22,171
Rym: Yeah, but I guess my thesis on all this because you know, I'm in training right now And it's actually pretty good, but I could have done without the training.

896
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:23,758
Rym: I am looking forward to.

897
01:01:23,778 --> 01:01:34,828
Rym: in July I'm going to a C++ boot camp, which is basically it's actually Probably slightly above my level of coding C++, which is slowly fading Yes, but very slowly.

898
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:37,803
Scott: It's a slowest fade in the possible yeah universe.

899
01:01:37,843 --> 01:01:38,044
Scott: it'll

900
01:01:38,064 --> 01:02:15,920
Rym: be useful to me because in the enterprise world a lot of things are written in C++ and being an engineer in the manner that I am I often need to interface between guy who wrote a complex multi-threaded C++ or C or objective C demon and Someone who is not that technical and I have to be able to mediate between the two like say an operations guy Finds what he thinks is a bug, but he can't describe like he knows what's not going right But he doesn't know why it's not going right and the engineer who wrote the demon doesn't know enough about the business process To figure out what went wrong.

901
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:23,392
Rym: You need someone who knows the IT side and the business side and can actually look at the code and understand what the demon Was trying to do to explain to the developer.

902
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:24,640
Rym: Here's what really happened.

903
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,665
Rym: There's a thread condition.

904
01:02:25,685 --> 01:02:33,634
Rym: that happening is I don't understand why you need Python training and C++ training Because I wanted C sharp training cuz that'll actually really useful to me and they said it.

905
01:02:33,654 --> 01:02:35,320
Rym: then they decided that C sharp.

906
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:37,639
Rym: There wasn't a good business case for me learning it in the company.

907
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:38,885
Scott: But the thing is right.

908
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:41,576
Scott: why do you need training for more than one language period?

909
01:02:41,596 --> 01:02:42,620
Scott: it's like if you can you know?

910
01:02:43,241 --> 01:02:51,051
Rym: You just look up the syntax and you feel to read any language mostly because the boot camp for C++ I think would have really forced me to learn more better coding practices.

911
01:02:51,112 --> 01:02:51,834
Scott: No, it doesn't.

912
01:02:52,075 --> 01:02:54,759
Scott: C++ isn't gonna teach you good It's gonna teach you bad coding.

913
01:02:56,363 --> 01:02:58,033
Scott: You see C++ is basically.

914
01:02:58,053 --> 01:03:02,052
Scott: it's an object-oriented language But you can also write in C kinda and it's also.

915
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:03,840
Scott: the syntax is a complete mess.

916
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,513
Scott: There's all sorts of crazy symbols everywhere.

917
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:08,925
Rym: Yeah No, I like Python and this is the training I wanted.

918
01:03:09,086 --> 01:03:11,560
Rym: C++ was kind of my silver medal because I couldn't get what I really wanted.

919
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:16,665
Scott: But you know if you can read, you know, if you can read any program language You can probably read the C++.

920
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,614
Scott: and if you see a weird symbol just look it up.

921
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:21,894
Scott: You don't need training for it Yeah, but that you know training happens is?

922
01:03:21,974 --> 01:03:22,800
Rym: I work in enterprise?

923
01:03:25,237 --> 01:03:28,850
Rym: But Anyway, I guess my thesis in all this is that training.

924
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:42,959
Rym: a lot of companies will send people on training when really They would be much better off giving the people the time to learn it either at home with like, okay Take a week off and learn this thing or hey, don't do any work, but learning this thing.

925
01:03:43,641 --> 01:03:52,331
Rym: Because the people who are motivated will learn the thing regardless of whether they go to training or you give them time and the people Motivated aren't gonna learn any more at the training.

926
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:53,917
Rym: then they're gonna learn if you give them the time off.

927
01:03:54,379 --> 01:03:54,580
Rym: Mm-hmm.

928
01:03:54,781 --> 01:04:05,398
Rym: so really you should just figure out who you think is not motivated and never let them learn anything and If possible get rid of them and hire someone who is motivated.

929
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:14,780
Scott: But I mean what you know, there might be someone who you know, they might not be motivated to learn new things But they are good at a thing already and you need that thing that they're right.

930
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:19,120
Rym: But what if they need to learn something else and they're not motivated?

931
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,655
Rym: Don't send them to training if you know, they're not gonna learn.

932
01:04:21,977 --> 01:04:22,520
Scott: that's obvious.

933
01:04:22,562 --> 01:04:29,220
Rym: Yeah Definitely, but I think a lot of companies send people to training Thinking that that will somehow make them learn a lot of times.

934
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:37,431
Scott: She's better off hiring someone else who knows the thing that you need to know rather than training someone you already have Yep, or hiring a consultant or outsourcing or all those things.

935
01:04:37,892 --> 01:04:39,076
Scott: Yeah, it's like hi.

936
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,280
Scott: I've got these guys.

937
01:04:40,361 --> 01:04:41,068
Scott: They all know.

938
01:04:41,331 --> 01:04:42,179
Scott: X I need.

939
01:04:42,684 --> 01:04:43,692
Scott: Suddenly we got product.

940
01:04:43,753 --> 01:04:46,209
Scott: why coming in here Do I train these guys in product?

941
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:46,430
Scott: why?

942
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:48,100
Scott: or just hire someone who already knows product?

943
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,045
Rym: Why that's so much easier time?

944
01:04:50,085 --> 01:04:55,420
Rym: too many job postings require very specific knowledge of specific things that almost no one's actually gonna know.

945
01:04:55,964 --> 01:05:03,996
Rym: Well, that's you know separate problem Yeah, but companies put way too much stock in training and don't trust their workers nearly enough.

946
01:05:04,057 --> 01:05:12,516
Rym: if you're paying someone a lot of money because you Nominally Understand that they're intelligent you're paying them for the fact that they're an intelligent person who can make decisions.

947
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:21,549
Rym: if you then Like don't trust them to be motivated enough to learn something that's important to their job on their own Then why are you paying the smart person?

948
01:05:21,569 --> 01:05:23,800
Rym: You could get someone less skilled to do the same job.

949
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,163
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

950
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:29,892
Scott: if you don't if you're not gonna let someone make a decision Why do you need to hire someone who's smart enough to make a decision?

951
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:32,100
Scott: hire someone who is incapable of making decision?

952
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:35,780
Scott: And you'll pay them a lot less and you'll make all the decisions that you're already making.

953
01:05:36,121 --> 01:05:44,465
Rym: And if your company ever buys really big and bloated enterprise software and you get to go to training Think of it as a week-long vacation somewhere boring.

954
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,090
Scott: It could be in Vegas.

955
01:05:47,871 --> 01:05:51,449
Rym: Yeah, usually the training ends up being in North Carolina or down by DC.

956
01:05:52,772 --> 01:05:54,283
Rym: Actually a lot of it's in the financial district.

957
01:05:54,303 --> 01:05:55,129
Rym: So you get to go to New York.

958
01:06:01,892 --> 01:06:04,430
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

959
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:09,290
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

960
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:14,570
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes discussion news and more.

961
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:22,250
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

962

963
01:06:27,031 --> 01:06:30,121
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

964
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:31,786
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

965
01:06:31,926 --> 01:06:33,210
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
