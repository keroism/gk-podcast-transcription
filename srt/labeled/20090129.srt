00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,400
Scott:

2
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:12,127
Rym: It's Thursday January 29th.

3
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:12,768
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,914
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:16,839
Rym: We are addicted to the night.

6
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:26,614
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:37,622
Scott: So I walk out the door this morning right and I close it and I go oh shit Cuz.

8
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:42,580
Scott: I thought for a second that I'd left my keys on the other side of said closed door.

9
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:48,660
Rym: That would have been the worst because you can't get back in to get him, but you can't get in the car.

10
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,427
Scott: Yeah, I'd basically be uh-oh.

11
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:51,492
Scott: I can't do anything.

12
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:51,994
Rym: What do you do?

13
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:52,878
Rym: What do you do?

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,979
Scott: It's like if I could at least get in the car.

15
00:00:55,261 --> 00:01:04,060
Scott: Well, you know I could just drive to the train station go to work come back come home And by the time I get home, I'll just come home late and I know someone will be here the key.

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,040
Scott: But well, you could just walk to the train station I guess but it was too late and it was cold.

17
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:10,170
Rym: Yeah, it is cold.

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:10,937
Scott: I wasn't gonna happen.

19
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:23,520
Scott: so I Luckily, I just left the keys in a different pocket and I had them But it was uh, it was worrying for about 10 seconds.

20
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:33,875
Rym: It's one thing why I always kind of be sure whenever I go outside from my house that I am prepared to deal with Any situation that involves me not being able to get back.

21
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:37,286
Scott: I had my phone So, but who are you gonna call?

22
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:37,949
Rym: I'm at work.

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,374
Rym: Emily and Alex are at work.

24
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:42,104
Scott: I could have called somebody Called the landlord.

25
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:46,579
Rym: I guess yeah someone like I locked myself out the locksmith.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,220
Rym: Huh now the problem would be if you had left your wallet and keys inside because then you can't even take the train.

27
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:55,720
Rym: You can't prove to the locksmith who you are.

28
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,760
Scott: I could have looked on Google Maps or whatever and gotten a taxicab to the train station.

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,992
Rym: How are you gonna pay for that with my wallet?

30
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,400
Rym: What if you don't have your wallet?

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:04,881
Rym: Well, I did.

32
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,050
Scott: I'm saying what if I'm talking about only keys?

33
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,757
Rym: what if you forget wallet and keys?

34
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:09,360
Rym: then you're fucked.

35
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,798
Scott: Oh, it's a pay him with cell phone.

36
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,287
Rym: What if you also forget cell phone?

37
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:15,949
Rym: just remember that.

38
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:19,222
Scott: how would I couldn't pay the cab I couldn't get the cab No wallet.

39
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:20,125
Rym: You got no ID.

40
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:23,415
Rym: Plus now you got to worry about what do I do before I freeze to death.

41
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:29,580
Scott: I Would just find a friendly neighbor with the telephone walk to like the car dealership.

42
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:34,440
Scott: Can I stand inside for the gas station pick up a quarter off the ground?

43
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,213
Rym: Use the pay phone quarters not enough and I don't think that pay phone works.

44
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:41,100
Scott: I'm pretty sure pay phones take quarters.

45
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:58,264
Rym: well, the last time I collect I used a pay phone two years ago when I was in New York and my cell phone battery died and I luckily Somehow remembered the phone number that I had to call Numbers either.

46
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:12,420
Rym: so I tried to call this cell phone number and then I discovered that It would have been I think 40. it would have been 40 cents or 50 cents to make a local call But because it was a cell phone it wasn't actually a local call so I was screwed anyway.

47
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:18,050
Rym: So I had to use my credit card Through the pay phone to make a call.

48
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:18,613
Scott: Did that work?

49
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:20,160
Scott: Yeah, that's not too bad.

50
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:26,600
Rym: I had to call and then it was like You know credit card number and had a type of credit card number in and I paid like five bucks.

51
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:30,419
Scott: I'll just push zero and be like if I could make it happen.

52
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,054
Scott: Collect if possible collect.

53
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:41,590
Rym: Yeah Well, you know when I was a kid and I would I you know before I had a cell phone that I could use all The time because the family had two cell phones.

54
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,420
Rym: So often I wasn't the one who got to have the cell phone.

55
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:45,519
Rym: It's like high school.

56
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:51,265
Scott: Well, yeah, whenever I was like in middle school in high school on a field trip or something like that I would always call home collect.

57
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:54,316
Scott: Oh my I called home collect from like Israel.

58
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:56,746
Scott: It was like yeah Take that either.

59
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:59,400
Rym: my parents would give me the cell phone unless they gave it to my brother.

60
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:00,097
Rym: They were using it.

61
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:04,900
Rym: But we realized I didn't need it because I used to go to the community college to take classes like after school.

62
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,060
Rym: Like I'd go take chemistry and stoichiometry and jazz band and stuff.

63
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:14,220
Rym: So when I needed a ride home whenever class ended what I would do is collect call home and they would get.

64
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:17,096
Rym: They would be asked if they wanted a call from pick-me-up.

65
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,616
Scott: And you said they say no, I don't want to because they'd come pick me up.

66
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:25,425
Rym: Yep Except that one time.

67
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,096
Rym: I I fell asleep in class.

68
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:29,160
Rym: It was a night class here.

69
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,600
Rym: So I go to high school and I come home and then at like eight o'clock, I'd go to this class.

70
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,586
Rym: They'd ended it like 1030.

71
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:37,535
Rym: I just fell asleep in class and no one said anything.

72
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:39,220
Scott: So you're just sleeping in this classroom.

73
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:46,140
Rym: I woke up alone with the lights off in this classroom But I didn't know what time it was and I wasn't sure where I was for a few minutes.

74
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,128
Scott: Is this was this building closed?

75
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:49,314
Rym: Well, the building was open.

76
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:54,340
Rym: there were classes until like midnight But the hallways were all kind of dark and for a while.

77
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,458
Scott: How long would you have stayed in there without not doing anything?

78
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:57,861
Scott: I

79
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:01,866
Rym: don't know if I if I hadn't woken I woke up at like 11 So I dealt with

80
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:07,853
Scott: what if you had not woken up until say like, you know The next day when it was time to go to school again, uh, well

81
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:09,700
Rym: one I would have just skipped school.

82
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:13,682
Scott: well, obviously, but you know what like Who?

83
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:15,791
Scott: would anyone like a security guard have found you?

84
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:18,100
Rym: or maybe the janitor would have found me?

85
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,680
Scott: Maybe if there was a janitor that day, maybe I would clean the classrooms every day.

86
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:26,965
Rym: Maybe I would have gotten woken up by the like the 8 a.m Class the next day and then I would have gone.

87
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:31,479
Rym: Oh, well, I'm a couple hours late for high school might as well not go.

88
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:34,097
Rym: Yeah, I'll hang out here all day.

89
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:42,697
Rym: Yeah, that was before I could drive legally so I was still like I needed rides everywhere and it sucked.

90
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,264
Scott: yeah those days Those are not good days.

91
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:49,640
Rym: Yeah, it's weird to think that there was a time when I could not drive.

92
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,707
Scott: Yeah, there was a time when I could.

93
00:05:52,747 --> 00:06:03,139
Scott: well I guess if I had been allowed to I could have driven but I totally could have Driven as yes when I like as soon as I was tall enough to reach the pedals and also see.

94
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:10,877
Rym: well It's like an RIT when my car got repoed that one time or when I was living here working at IBM and my car broke And it took him a week to fix it.

95
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:17,340
Rym: Those times like I take cars for granted and suddenly the simplest of tasks were impossible.

96
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,720
Rym: It was like alright, I'm hungry.

97
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,248
Rym: How do I get food?

98
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:25,120
Rym: There is no way to get to the grocery store.

99
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:29,360
Rym: I tried to call a cab and they're like the cabs not gonna take me to the grocery store there.

100
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,728
Scott: I mean there are plenty of people I've seen.

101
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:31,252
Scott: take cabs.

102
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:32,580
Rym: the girl depends on where you live.

103
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:39,858
Rym: No cab was gonna drive me from that house on the top of the mountain down to town to the house of the mountain.

104
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:45,540
Rym: Yeah Now when I lived in Poughkeepsie, I could walk like 45 minutes and get to a grocery store.

105
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,323
Scott: Yeah, you should have done.

106
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:48,330
Scott: you should got an airport cab.

107
00:06:48,712 --> 00:07:04,564
Scott: they'll take you to the airport fly to JFK right take the subway into the city and then get a hotel which you realize it's only 50 bucks to take a Helicopter from Midtown to JFK.

108
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:05,486
Scott: Is it $50 $50?

109
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:07,529
Scott: I found also it's like 45 to take it to LaGuardia.

110
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:20,132
Scott: Oh $50 per person, even if it's just one person probably.

111
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:22,580
Scott: or is there a number of people that you need for the trip?

112
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,704
Rym: I think it's perfect.

113
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:24,267
Rym: I did not look.

114
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:25,734
Rym: where does the helicopter leave from?

115
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:26,337
Rym: like 34th Street?

116
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:28,824
Scott: I'm so doing that.

117
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:29,867
Rym: I know seriously.

118
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:35,867
Rym: It's not that much more money than like the shuttle or the car service I'd take anyway, the shuttles like 20 bucks.

119
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:37,633
Scott: The helicopter is no traffic.

120
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:37,914
Scott: Yeah.

121
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:39,600
Scott: No fun helicopter ride.

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,895
Scott: Yeah, so why the fuck does I found out about this?

123
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:45,260
Rym: some guy works like Well, you know what?

124
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,389
Rym: I just found out and the guy next to him was like what he's like.

125
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,594
Rym: you can take a helicopter to JFK for like 50 bucks for Midtown.

126
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,227
Rym: They had the same conversation.

127
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:54,412
Rym: We're having now the set.

128
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,903
Scott: the next time I had to go to JFK Helicopter for reals.

129
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:58,866
Scott: Oh, man.

130
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:02,176
Rym: Alright, so it's Thursday, you know, we're kind of right.

131
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:04,459
Scott: I bet it's loud though You're probably gonna bring the headphones.

132
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,465
Rym: Yeah, helicopters are loud.

133
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,975
Scott: I mean, I guess you know, it's a good question though.

134
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:14,179
Scott: It could be right It's probably one of those little glass bubble helicopters, you know, like the traffic, right?

135
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,980
Scott: But it could be like a big two-roader like military hospital helicopter.

136
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:26,240
Scott: They're not gonna send you in a Chinook No They could if they cuz think about it for 50 bucks.

137
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:28,687
Scott: right that thing can make the trip real quick.

138
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,659
Scott: right and Think about how many people you can get in there, right?

139
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,308
Scott: The little tiny helicopter you get what.

140
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:41,073
Scott: maybe three people in there with the luggage Right the big one you get like a bus worth of people in there, right.

141
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:44,766
Scott: so $50 times a bus That's pretty good money.

142
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:51,169
Scott: It makes it worth it, you know, so maybe it is a big-ass helicopter But they kind that you know people jump out of.

143
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:54,118
Rym: I imagine it would be loud though because I took a.

144
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:55,143
Scott: yeah It's loud.

145
00:08:55,485 --> 00:09:06,564
Rym: I like when I flew down to a Columbia In near DC for that business trip because I because of the time and when I flew I ended up taking a prop plane Both ways.

146
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:10,240
Scott: Oh, I guess this helicopter takes off from the top of a building, right?

147
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:11,100
Rym: I have no idea.

148
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:14,780
Scott: So I guess you had to go to the building and get to the top and then where do you buy the ticket?

149
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,703
Scott: And what's the schedule?

150
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:16,346
Rym: I don't know.

151
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:18,776
Rym: I found like I found out about this now.

152
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:25,278
Rym: It was like oh, man The next time I fly like the first thing I'm gonna do and then where does it land?

153
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:25,740
Scott: at JFK?

154
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,860
Scott: How do I get from the helicopter to the airplane?

155
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,908
Rym: Like I said, I didn't sort all this business out.

156
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:30,972
Rym: All I can think is 50 bucks.

157
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:32,136
Rym: That's probably worth it.

158
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:36,279
Rym: Yeah, probably Especially considering how long that bus took to get there.

159
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:45,771
Scott: Well, cuz I had to go and you know is in rush hour right going down like the Grand Central Parkway Like the Queen's Midtown Tunnel, it's you know, it's traffic there.

160
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,557
Scott: But anyway, that's mood sailing.

161
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:51,212
Rym: it is Thursday You know hanging loose nice and nice and relaxed here.

162
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:52,860
Rym: We can do it everyone and I got to bring this up.

163
00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:09,380
Rym: it's kind of a almost a Tuesday news, but and we don't even really need to do news, but a Story about some doll and some crazy woman said that Apparently the doll would periodically say Islam is the light.

164
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,832
Rym: What yeah, and the news reported this like it was a big deal.

165
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:16,340
Rym: It was all over the place secret messages and toys.

166
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:17,684
Rym: Islam is the light.

167
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:18,527
Rym: Did you hear it?

168
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:19,089
Rym: I don't know.

169
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:22,580
Rym: and I heard it and it sounded like you're gaga gaga buh-gah.

170
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:26,600
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's sort of like seeing Jesus in the bread, right?

171
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:31,493
Scott: If you just make enough random noises, you know, someone's gonna hear.

172
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:32,696
Scott: you know something in.

173
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,080
Scott: it's like playing records backwards.

174
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:37,940
Scott: Someone's gonna hear Satan something and sometimes someone will do it on purpose.

175
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:42,055
Scott: And it's like looking at static on the TV screen.

176
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:47,259
Scott: You're gonna see a face Cuz you know or you're gonna look at the clouds and you'll see a dragon.

177
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:49,639
Scott: It's how it happens, you know.

178
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:59,148
Rym: But anyway that that's not the story that sort of thing happens all the time and the fact that the media Always kind of makes a big deal about it Especially the local news the like local interest.

179
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:00,332
Scott: you called the news station.

180
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:03,119
Scott: the next time I see a cloud that looks like a penis or something.

181
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:08,319
Scott: And now they'll put a news story like local pranksters make cloud penis-shaped cloud.

182
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:18,700
Rym: But I saw this story where Someone else apparently found that in some Nintendo game.

183
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,492
Rym: It also says Islam is the light.

184
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:22,557
Scott: was it a gay?

185
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,866
Scott: Did it actually say it in text?

186
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:28,220
Rym: No, no, so here I looked into this a little bit.

187
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,827
Rym: I did a small bit of investigative reporting.

188
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:32,511
Rym: fact number one.

189
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:35,939
Rym: It is in fact the same crazy lady.

190
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,280
Rym: Number two It's the same sound clip like I listened to it and I went to the old one.

191
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:57,857
Rym: It is the exact same Baba Guga like it's identical.

192
00:11:57,897 --> 00:11:58,580
Rym: you listen to him.

193
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:00,592
Rym: It is clearly both of these.

194
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,920
Rym: toys took the audio.

195
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:06,819
Scott: So a Nintendo game and a doll have the same exact audio clip in them.

196
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:10,031
Rym: Yes Well fact number three, you know what game it is.

197
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:13,279
Rym: Oh, you know the pets franchise.

198
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:17,510
Rym: Yeah, the like dogs and cats.

199
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,075
Scott: Oh, yes games.

200
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:20,680
Scott: I think you're talking about an NES game.

201
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:22,468
Rym: No, no DS game.

202
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:38,660
Rym: I just said, okay, okay, so Apparently as far as I can tell there is a knockoff of those and there's a game called baby pals with an S Not a Z. Whoa and That is that alone is one of the saddest things I've ever heard.

203
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:47,858
Rym: But yes this game and that doll Used they might have been they use the same like stock baby going but goo goo gah.

204
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,099
Rym: that According to one crazy lady sounds like Islam is the light.

205
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:53,728
Scott: They got giga.

206
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:54,974
Rym: Gah gah gizel.

207
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:55,979
Rym: Islam is the light.

208
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:59,752
Scott: Nothing, baby says sounds like Islam is the light.

209
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,559
Rym: So this woman is crazy.

210
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:07,795
Rym: Obviously the reporters for this story are even not easier.

211
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,640
Rym: not quote quote quote quote.

212
00:13:10,202 --> 00:13:10,886
Rym: This is a quote.

213
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:21,920
Rym: This is verbatim from the video Nintendo's Manufactured by a third party, so they're not responsible for the content.

214
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:27,960
Rym: But the game's packaging clearly states that the game is licensed by Nintendo.

215
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:31,832
Rym: People don't understand how this works.

216
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:36,992
Scott: Oh Oh, you're the reporters don't understand what licensed by Nintendo means.

217
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:37,373
Scott: Yes.

218
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:39,380
Scott: I thought you were saying like Nintendo is stupid.

219
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,283
Scott: I was like, wait a minute.

220
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:45,992
Rym: No, no, no, no, no and quote the woman not just my daughter's toys But we have a son too.

221
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:50,819
Rym: now I feel like I have to listen to all his little toys to make sure they're not saying it.

222
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,834
Scott: What first of all, right?

223
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:55,504
Scott: Okay Obviously, you're crazy.

224
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:56,869
Scott: The toys are not saying it.

225
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,499
Scott: But if they were so what?

226
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,104
Rym: So what I mean?

227
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:04,250
Rym: cuz this is what bothers me.

228
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:09,679
Rym: this article and the article from before Beg the question.

229
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:14,355
Rym: They the question that is begged is that how come this is bad.

230
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:27,168
Scott: even if it said it Would it be better or worse if it said Jesus is awesome Yeah, all right, and even if it was saying it right did these kids say hey, mommy My toy said Islam is the light.

231
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:30,867
Scott: know that kids just hear gaga gaga guy It's only the mom who hears it.

232
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:31,269
Rym: Actually.

233
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,600
Rym: The mom says that the kid brought it to her attention.

234
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:35,227
Rym: I think it's because he has.

235
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:36,433
Scott: it could be wasn't at that kid?

236
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:39,064
Scott: if the kid wasn't raised by the crazy mom The kid wouldn't have thought of that.

237
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:40,129
Rym: you look at the woman.

238
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,800
Rym: She she's almost crazy eyes.

239
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,906
Rym: She's not quite but she she's like.

240
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:46,110
Scott: I bet she'd be indignant.

241
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:50,442
Scott: She is in a situation, but she's very slight Huh?

242
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:55,860
Rym: And it it's not that often you find a very slight person who is also the ultra indignant.

243
00:14:56,345 --> 00:15:01,144
Rym: It is usually the big fat one But I don't know.

244
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:06,159
Rym: but all these facts that I discovered about this I linked you an article that she had a stomach surgery.

245
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:09,941
Rym: I don't know.

246
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:10,581
Rym: I found this funny.

247
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:20,029
Rym: But anyway things of the day nice and quick.

248
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:20,889
Rym: This is pretty cool.

249
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:27,193
Rym: It is a XLR camera not XLR SLR.

250
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:37,550
Rym: yeah, I got microphones on the mind But no the the important thing is that it is cut in half and you can see the insides and it's pretty cool.

251
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:41,382
Scott: Yeah, knowing how it works will help you a little bit.

252
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:43,670
Scott: But you know what you still won't know how to use it.

253
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:51,935
Rym: nah, actually Emily is currently borrowing her mom's super fancy digital digital SLR and It's pretty cool.

254
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:53,380
Scott: It is very cool.

255
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,246
Rym: It's also not easy to use Yes, but once you learn like you start your pictures look a lot better.

256
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:07,929
Rym: No kidding But I point out that there are one two, three, four, five six seven eight nine Lenses inside.

257
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:12,835
Scott: Well, usually right there's this stuff on the inside But then there's also.

258
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:15,310
Scott: you screw a lens on to the front of it, right?

259
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,370
Scott: So they just cut it the camera in half or do they also, you know, I also have a front bit attached.

260
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,840
Scott: Okay, see you so there's a lens on the front.

261
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,809
Scott: The lens is not actually the camera.

262
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:28,130
Rym: the lens Yeah, there's the front one, two, three, four five lenses.

263
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:33,410
Rym: Then there's a middle lens that moves and then there's one two, three, four five more lenses and then there's three more lenses.

264
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:36,028
Rym: Yep, it's pretty cool.

265
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,820
Scott: Yeah, that's that's how it works thing of the day.

266
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:40,663
Rym: It's cool.

267
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:43,251
Scott: cuz I mean think about it right to do all that Right.

268
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:50,450
Scott: I mean, you know, you always need the moving lens right to sort of be able to adjust the focal length and whatnot.

269
00:16:50,592 --> 00:17:06,598
Scott: right, but Think about how precise and perfect you're like the one lens would have to be that would just do like the work of all The front five, you know, this is why the lenses cost thousands of dollars And the cameras also cost hundreds of dollars,

270
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,790
Rym: yeah, at least we don't need any spider silk in there anymore.

271
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:12,839
Scott: We used to need spider silk for telescopes.

272
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,829
Rym: Mostly actually they used to use silk to make telescope.

273
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:22,155
Rym: It's completely different to make but to make the crosshairs for or precision Instruments or scientific cameras do.

274
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:26,705
Rym: if you need had a crosshair or anything to aim precisely they would use spider silk.

275
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,356
Rym: Ah That's clever clever girl.

276
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:44,665
Scott: they use it on like scopes on guns and things also, I don't know I'm not really an expert on this sort of thing Alright, so I was gonna use this on another day, but I got nothing.

277
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:46,190
Scott: so check this side out.

278
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:57,310
Scott: it's called Miffy's I think and What they did is they wet and they found fonts from video games and they made them and that's pretty much it.

279
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:14,149
Scott: so if you want to type in double dragon ease or You know, I guess Gradius ease or Donkey Kong, you know made of you know, metal I beams font then This site's got like a whole bunch of them.

280
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:19,354
Scott: So if you're doing like a video game remix parody or something These could be real useful.

281
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:24,150
Scott: or maybe you're making like a fan site or you know anything along those lines.

282
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:32,387
Rym: So, okay over the weekend, you know We had the crew together and we played our burning wheel and we played the little engine that could kill.

283
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,129
Rym: We talked about that.

284
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:40,768
Rym: We also did something good over the weekend as opposed to that bad game that we'll never talk about again.

285
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:42,798
Rym: It's okay I thought it was pretty good.

286
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:43,381
Rym: I enjoyed it.

287
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:46,814
Rym: Uh, we watch Sorry for the edit.

288
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:51,530
Rym: there Scott's up Ellen and he kind of blew his nose all over what I was saying.

289
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:52,595
Scott: I'm not Ellen.

290
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:53,539
Scott: I just had my.

Rym: but So Scott who never gets sick except when he gets sick is sick.

295
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:07,033
Scott: I was sick and now I am just Expelling snots.

296
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:08,660
Rym: so you're not sick.

297
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,050
Rym: You're just expelling tons and tons of mucus.

298
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:15,527
Scott: Yeah that you know, it was from when I was sick and now that's not how that works.

299
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,956

Scott: Well, not finally me we weren't.

303
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:35,619
Rym: it was like a long period of time between me from the moment when I knew this existed Until that time it was too late.

304
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,365
Rym: I had wanted to say it.

305
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:38,530
Rym: I was excited about it.

306
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:42,064
Scott: I was a little I was interested but I wasn't excited.

307
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:43,289
Rym: I love this sort of thing.

308
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:45,709
Scott: I'm okay with this sort of thing.

309
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:50,500
Rym: You know It's good If you didn't see the forum thread or you live under a rock repo.

310
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,260
Rym: the genetic opera is the story of a horrible future Where suddenly everyone has organ failure?

311
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,504
Scott: Yeah, basically what hat?

312
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:00,309
Scott: I'll summarize the plot, right?

313
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,077
Scott: Someone in you know, wait, wait, wait.

314
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:06,809
Rym: now if we're gonna summarize we can summarize it much more succinctly than you were about to do.

315
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:12,510
Rym: It is a future where organs can be repossessed much like cars.

316
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:19,330
Scott: Yep, people buy organs, you know to prevent themselves from dying, but they also buy organs.

317
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:26,395
Scott: you know because they want, you know for vanity reasons and They're very expensive.

318
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:33,038
Scott: so rich people are are just living it up but poor people are Buying them anyway, and then if I

319
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:41,377
Rym: like this you finance the secondhand liver But then you know your fall behind on the payments The repo man comes and cuts it out

320
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:44,406
Scott: and then you just fall over and you have no liver.

321
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:45,730
Scott: and I've been bleeding everywhere.

322
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,403
Rym: Yeah, and it's basically.

323
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,710
Rym: it's not that gory.

324
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:56,175
Rym: It's a lot less gory than you might think but the gore is really like cheesy Movie gore.

325
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:58,062
Rym: it's not that much of it.

326
00:20:58,122 --> 00:20:59,788
Rym: It's primarily singing.

327
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:11,619
Scott: well pseudo singing yeah, well, I mean there's not that much compared to each of the killer but there's it's in there as I think my favorite one is the repo.

328
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:18,120
Rym: man is kind of singing to himself while he's repossessing from a guy and Toward the end of the song as he's ripping the guts out.

329
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:25,929
Rym: He kind of sticks his hand up the guy's abdomen and Manipulates him like a puppet to sing close harmony.

330
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,880
Rym: It's just the way it's done is because it he's doing it.

331
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:35,963
Rym: then he kind of looks at the thing and then he kind of like Realizes what he's doing and kind of pulls his hand out like huh?

332
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,429
Rym: Okay enough of that.

333
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:38,660
Rym: Back to work.

334
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,280
Rym: Yeah But it's an opera like.

335
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:55,549
Rym: it's an opera in almost the truest sense but it's just about organs being repossessed and it's Pete said it best this is if nothing else Over the top in every way that something can be over the top.

336
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:56,454
Rym: It is.

337
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:59,830
Scott: I think you could be more over the top, but it wouldn't be very easy.

338
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:07,060
Rym: well, I think it's more that every individual aspect of repo the genetic opera is Over the top.

339
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,052
Rym: to a degree it is like the singing is just Silly.

340
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:25,484
Rym: it gets to the point where the the businessman semi bad guys in the limo with a girl and he's basically Singing the plot at her In a scene where it almost looks like she's surprised that he is singing.

341
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:28,814
Rym: Mm-hmm Yeah, he's like.

342
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:29,817
Rym: this is the plot.

343
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,382
Rym: I am singing the plot to you.

344
00:22:31,402 --> 00:22:31,482
Rym: What?

345
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:31,743
Rym: Yes the plot.

346
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,188
Rym: This is the plot.

347
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:35,670
Rym: Here we go the plot.

348
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:44,089
Scott: Sometimes it gets like a little bit corny and in the singing, you know Because he'll be saying things you already know.

349
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:52,130
Scott: But it's like they just need something to sing and it needs some words that both say something and you know They they had to sing them.

350
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,443
Scott: so they'll just sort of like sing for the sake of singing and just they'll be.

351
00:22:56,483 --> 00:22:59,312
Scott: basically it feels like the characters are like It.

352
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:02,063
Scott: sometimes it almost feels like they're making it up as they go along.

353
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:05,133
Scott: Just try to get any word they can Fit in.

354
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:08,655
Rym: Yeah, I guess what I would say is that this is repo.

355
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:10,414
Rym: I Recommend you all.

356
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:10,675
Rym: see it.

357
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:14,048
Rym: If you're listening to GeekNights, you will glean some enjoyment from this.

358
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:16,980
Scott: I guarantee It's not gonna be your favorite thing ever.

359
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,390
Scott: I don't think but it's not bad.

360
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:21,948
Rym: It's got a chance of being your favorite thing ever - I guess.

361
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:25,960
Scott: yeah There are certain people for whom this will be their favorite thing ever

362
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:39,630
Rym: because it's kind of silly and kind of gory and There are a few really really good songs in here, of course, I'll admit While the this the set pieces I guess or while what's going on is kind of cheesy.

363
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:47,490
Rym: It's an opera not a musical and a lot of the songs are not memorable like they're interesting to watch.

364
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:55,582
Scott: Yeah It's like usually when you have a musical right you get some show tunes and the show tunes are like Memorable and they are fucking stuck in your head like that Seinfeld.

365
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,305
Rym: George comes back.

366
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:57,590
Rym: He's like a master of the house.

367
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:01,182
Scott: Exactly, I mean, that's a fucking song right?

368
00:24:01,623 --> 00:24:03,130
Scott: This doesn't really have any song.

369
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:04,093
Rym: I can't even read.

370
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:08,790
Rym: lifelong shit the only little brain regular Voltaire thinks he's quite a lover.

371
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:10,524
Rym: But there's not much of that God.

372
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,290
Rym: I think I remember.

373
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,260
Scott: I don't remember all the words.

374
00:24:19,301 --> 00:24:20,428
Scott: I remember all that the tune.

375
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:20,770
Rym: really.

376
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:24,847
Rym: I think I remember all the words to all the songs of Les Mis as I go.

377
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:25,550
Rym: Yes, I do.

378
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:26,613
Rym: I know them all.

379
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:28,779
Scott: I know much of the words.

380
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:29,762
Rym: I know the whole thing.

381
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:30,765
Scott: Not all of it.

382
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:39,270
Scott: Anyway, the Right, the only song that you can really that I really remember from this thing tonight.

383
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:44,070
Scott: Yeah, is that one because that's the it's sort of like they do that one like a few times, you know.

384
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,089
Scott: So like the recur the what's it called?

385
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,905
Rym: The it's not a leitmotif because that's all the character.

386
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:55,020
Rym: It's the What though I forget.

387
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:03,980
Scott: but they you know, they do it like, you know It's the one that they play when they come in and then they do it for real somewhere in the middle And then they sort of do a little bit the I think part of it.

388
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,130
Rym: Just that that song is over here.

389
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,339
Scott: Maybe is that what that is?

390
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,650
Rym: No, that's not the overtures.

391
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:14,470
Rym: Yeah, the overtures what they play but the overtures what plays when the curtains are still closed at an opera.

392
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:31,310
Rym: Yeah, go in but then usually like, you know how like you'll um, I Come on on the curtains that are closed and then if it's a Wagner opera You've got about four hours of him masturbating all over you before the actual opera begins.

393
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,627
Rym: That is the overture.

394
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:45,930
Scott: But see usually like, you know There's like a theme in the overture and then they sort of like it's not attached to a character like leitmotif is it's just they Sort of play it, you know throughout as like a some sort of theme?

395
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:52,588
Rym: Maybe I guess is it just a theme a musical theme perhaps a recurring theme of some kind.

396
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:57,530
Scott: Yes But anyway, I was looking for a more fancy word than that.

397
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:11,508
Rym: That song is the musical song I would say because yeah You will it'll be in your head and every time someone says a phrase that fits lyrically or rhythmically into Any part of that song the whole song is gonna come out.

398
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:15,850
Rym: Could you hand me that bottle the little blue bottle the little blue bottle?

399
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:19,873
Rym: And.

400
00:26:20,054 --> 00:26:25,300
Rym: but otherwise a lot of the songs are not Memorable at all.

401
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:26,505
Rym: They're really fun.

402
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:31,164
Scott: and I want to point out It's like there are some songs in there and I remember there was a song there.

403
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:32,690
Scott: It was sort of fun.

404
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:33,758
Scott: It was.

405
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:36,435
Scott: maybe some of the lyrics were corny But the song itself was.

406
00:26:36,515 --> 00:26:40,110
Scott: it seems like you know, what happens is like here's a good example, right?

407
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:58,439
Scott: Look at something like Oh Detroit Metal City, right They basically when they did Detroit the music in the Detroit Metal City anime They took the lyrics from the manga right and then they made Songs that sort of matched those lyrics.

408
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:08,630
Scott: So the result is that the actual words they were saying were Funny words that were written right but the music didn't always go with those words.

409
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:13,108
Scott: So well, so the result is that the music was slightly not so great.

410
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:25,707
Scott: A lot of it would be kind of like if GeekNights sounded like this all the time in Repo, they did the opposite right which is that they said, all right, let's make good music.

411
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:33,919
Scott: All right, here's the tune You know dead in it and in it, you know, they would come up with a song and they'd be like, okay Somehow make the lyrics fit this song and it's like.

412
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:36,728
Rym: but even then I'll admit I really enjoyed this.

413
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:39,477
Rym: but the songs Were not that good.

414
00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:39,999
Rym: They were more.

415
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,885
Rym: Kate said they were set pieces.

416
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,210
Rym: They were not songs.

417
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,092
Scott: yeah, it's like.

418
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:47,601
Rym: the few songs there were were like there's.

419
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:55,478
Rym: there's a point and I really enjoyed this even though it had almost nothing to do with Anything but the.

420
00:27:55,618 --> 00:28:01,567
Rym: it suddenly cuts to the the girl singing the song 17 Yeah, and like suddenly nothing to do with anything.

421
00:28:01,607 --> 00:28:03,475
Rym: suddenly It's a music video.

422
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:07,048
Rym: and like the stuffed animals in the background like dancing and skeletons.

423
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:08,594
Scott: dancing And the skeleton was pretty good.

424
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:10,301
Rym: Jonah Jett makes a cameo.

425
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:11,366
Scott: It's not Jonah Jett.

426
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:12,310
Scott: It's Joan Jett.

427
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,715
Rym: Anyway, she makes a cameo.

428
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:19,413
Rym: Sarah Brightman and Ferris Hilton by the way are also in this along with a man named ogre Really?

429
00:28:19,855 --> 00:28:20,196
Rym: Yes.

430
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:20,638
Rym: Uh-huh.

431
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:32,870
Rym: Sarah Brightman plays blind mag which is interesting if you because she's basically playing Sarah Brightman except the line a Little especially if you've heard her a dive album.

432
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:43,915
Rym: Yeah If you've never heard Sarah Brightman's dive album, I suggest you seek it out If you want to that.

433
00:28:44,035 --> 00:28:46,643
Rym: I feel your seed raining down on me.

434
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:48,690
Rym: could this be my once-in-a-lifetime?

435
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:53,495
Rym: I like Sarah Brightman.

436
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:54,438
Rym: I've always been a fan.

437
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,250
Scott: you like any sort of diva ish lady.

438
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,595
Rym: Yeah, I kind of do.

439
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:00,860
Rym: I mean how to do?

440
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,330
Scott: I mean you put you like, you know fifth element.

441
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:04,414
Scott: You like the blue lady.

442
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:05,357
Rym: Well, you know what?

443
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:07,585
Rym: I do like opera.

444
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:12,609
Scott: I also like Musicals, I like those too, but not all of them.

445
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,693
Rym: Scott name an opera One.

446
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:20,710
Rym: just name one off the top of your head one Romeo and Juliet's an opera.

447
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:24,239
Rym: Yes, there technically is an opera Romeo and Juliet.

448
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,021
Rym: Have you seen it?

449
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:26,085
Scott: Yeah, I did it.

450
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:27,489
Rym: Can you name another opera?

451
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:34,140
Scott: Um Yeah, what was that one that was playing at the?

452
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:40,815
Scott: the thing that we wanted to see the magic loot the marriage of Figaro Barbara of Seville.

Rym: This is an opera.

458
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:59,318
Rym: I mean, honestly if you're looking for good music or like I would say that dr Horrible was better produced and better music than this.

459
00:30:00,261 --> 00:30:00,582
Scott: I don't know.

460
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:01,044

Rym: It's just a short musical.

475
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:24,963
Rym: Yeah It's really short - you can watch the whole thing in like half-hour.

476
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,788
Scott: I got stuff to do.

477
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:28,895
Rym: Stuff you have to do.

478
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:31,985
Rym: I can spend like an hour and a half on a repo.

479
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:33,650
Rym: You can't watch a 30-minute musical.

480
00:30:34,011 --> 00:30:36,058
Scott: Yeah, I'm watching captain Harlock.

481
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,286
Rym: Oh, so you given up on a hookah tono Ken.

482
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:47,411
Scott: Yeah, I gave up Little repetitive but a little bit I Don't know.

483
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:48,875
Rym: I we all watch this.

484
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:53,187
Rym: the front row crew watched this as a group and it was enjoyed by all.

485
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:57,930
Rym: no one said I didn't like this or that was not worth my time.

486
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,190
Scott: It's a good six and a half or seven out of ten somewhere in there.

487
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:05,904
Rym: I would say it's maybe seven and a half funnier than it is good.

488
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:06,305
Rym: Like it is.

489
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:07,509
Rym: Yeah entertaining this.

490
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,974
Rym: It's interesting.

491
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:10,840
Rym: It is unique.

492
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,288
Scott: really what it has is the style of.

493
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:13,910
Scott: it is awesome.

494
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,990
Scott: It's like if someone just made a movie in that style, that was just a normal movie.

495
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:24,130
Scott: Actually, I sort of almost feel like if they would have just made you know a movie about the repo man.

496
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,870
Scott: That was just a normal movie not a musical or an opera.

497
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:29,229
Scott: It would have been like eight or nine out of ten.

498
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:32,065
Rym: It would have had to be a comedy or a dark comedy primarily.

499
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,070
Scott: definitely definitely.

500
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,402
Rym: But I'm just saying just had it been a musical.

501
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:36,930
Rym: I think it also could have been good.

502
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,415
Scott: Oh, yeah, that could have helped too.

503
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:51,030
Rym: And I but at the same time I really did like it for what it was because What it was like it I don't know the mediocrity of the production in many aspects and the fact that the music was kind of bland.

504
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,577
Rym: I don't know kind of works for what it was.

505
00:31:53,697 --> 00:31:55,182
Rym: It made it feel low-budget.

506
00:31:55,703 --> 00:31:57,589
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of a charming like.

507
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:00,880
Rym: It's like almost like charming is the word you're trying to.

508
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,690
Scott: it's like you're trying to make a cult classic on purpose.

509
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:08,370
Scott: It's like, you know something like Rocky hard cannot just you can't do that on purpose?

510
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,319
Rym: Yes, like they tried Transylvania 69,000 anyone.

511
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,485
Rym: that movies terrible exactly, right?

512
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:15,210
Scott: It's like you can't do that on purpose.

513
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:18,790
Scott: It just happens, you know cult classics happen, right?

514
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:24,890
Scott: This is like someone's trying to make a cult classic and they didn't succeed in making a cult classic.
