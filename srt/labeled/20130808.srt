1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,669
Rym: It's Thursday, August 8th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:12,250
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:12,972
Scott: I'm Skun.

4
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:15,760
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, Australia!

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,245
Scott: It's down under today.

6
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:22,171
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:26,842
Rym: Yeah, so like we said last week, we're back from Australia.

8
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:33,827
Rym: We didn't talk much about Australia because we mostly talked about the semi-related things that happened at, I don't know, PAX.

9
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:39,032
Scott: We gotta save up our load so that we can have a Thursday show idea because you know what's gonna happen.

10
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:41,709
Scott: the next time is a Thursday episode is gonna be like, "I want you to do the show about...".

11
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,423
Rym: There's a lot of things I would like to do the show on.

12
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:45,848
Scott: Yeah.

13
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:46,610
Scott: All bad ideas.

14
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:47,733
Rym: Lots of good ideas.

15
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:48,756
Scott: Bad ideas.

16
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:52,570
Rym: I bet if I brought it up and I mentioned one or two ideas ahead...

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,910
Scott: You could say any idea and the listener would say that it's a great idea.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,359
Rym: I think the listener is usually on my side.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,692
Scott: There is no idea you could say no matter how bad it was.

20
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:05,318
Scott: Like, talk about Starfish.

21
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:06,743
Scott: The listener would be like, "Fuck

22
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:07,165
Scott: yeah!".

23
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:12,147
Rym: I could talk about Starfish for about four minutes and I'd be out of Starfish talk.

24
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:12,850
Scott: They're cute.

25
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:13,936
Scott: The legs grow back.

26
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:15,142
Scott: There's big ones and small ones.

27
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:15,706
Scott: I like them.

28
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,116
Rym: It's kind of funny the way they move around.

29
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:18,101
Rym: The way they eat is cool.

30
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:19,988
Scott: They can get stuck on things.

31
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:20,429
Rym: Yup.

32
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:22,436
Rym: Their little beak is kind of cute.

33
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,042
Scott: I'd say they're cute already.

34
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:25,769
Rym: Yeah, but the beak is particularly cute.

35
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,641
Scott: The star part is cuter than the beak part.

36
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:33,034
Rym: They have a different kind of symmetry from what we have in many ways.

37
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:37,412
Rym: I think we can pad that out a little bit with some banter back and forth.

38
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:42,454
Scott: I don't think you have nineteen and a half minutes remaining of Starfish stuff.

39
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:46,990
Rym: I get the feeling that the listener is usually on my side and I think you're correct in that sentiment.

40
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:48,355
Scott: Anyway.

41
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:48,857
Scott: I don't know.

42
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,724
Rym: We keep stealing that listener joke.

43
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,034
Rym: Points to anyone who knows what we stole it from.

44
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:53,536
Scott: Whatever.

45
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:54,560
Rym: So, yeah.

46
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:59,343
Rym: Not going to talk much about news, but we got some Australian news since we were just in Australia.

47
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:01,896
Scott: Yeah, basically there's nothing going on in this country.

48
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:04,226
Rym: Yeah, there's no NSA scandal.

49
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:07,198
Rym: A man named Wiener didn't show his dick to people again.

50
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,142
Scott: That's not news either.

51
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:09,329
Scott: It's the same old, same old.

52
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,979
Scott: At least to us because we live in this country.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,006
Scott: So we hear about that stuff.

54
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:13,698
Rym: There was a mass shooting right before we left.

55
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,045
Rym: There was a mass shooting while we were gone.

56
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:16,613
Rym: There's a mass shooting like yesterday.

57
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:19,144
Scott: Yeah, that's not news either.

58
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:19,927
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

59
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:22,215
Rym: So we're going to talk about Australian news.

60
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:29,704
Scott: The only Australian news I noticed when I was there that wasn't sports was this news about a refugee boat or two.

61
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:30,790
Rym: Now it was interesting.

62
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,274
Scott: It wasn't clear how many there were because I was paying attention to other things and I only saw this news in passing.

63
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:53,519
Rym: But what I noticed was that all the places I saw news around, like newspaper headlines on TV, it was pretty much almost entirely about this with a secondary thing about how some states are going to in Australia are going to legalize gay marriage ahead of the federal government doing it.

64
00:02:54,661 --> 00:03:03,510
Rym: But it's interesting that because it was very, it's rare that the news in the US would have an issue like that that held the forefront.

65
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:08,689
Rym: Is it just because we have more scandalous kind of news that makes national attention?

66
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,829
Rym: Is it that we have more international connections so more stuff makes it to be news?

67
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,003
Rym: It was weird to see a single narrative lasting for weeks.

68
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:17,548
Scott: We weren't.

69
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,853
Scott: No, you don't know.

70
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,908
Rym: It was basically in the news the entire time we were there, which was just about two weeks.

71
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:25,216
Rym: We know we were there for weeks.

72
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:26,380
Scott: No, you weren't.

73
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,802
Scott: We were there.

74
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,167
Scott: All right.

75
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,151
Scott: Under two weeks.

76
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:29,492
Rym: Yeah.

77
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:30,496
Rym: More than one week.

78
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:31,440
Rym: Therefore plural.

79
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,724
Scott: No for it to be weeks.

80
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:33,165
Scott: Plural.

81
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:38,987
Rym: It must be at least two total and it was one full week and then portions of another week.

82
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,353
Scott: So that doesn't make weeks.

83
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:43,284
Scott: It involved two weeks and makes over a week.

84
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:46,252
Rym: It involved two individual week.

85
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:48,860
Scott: This is the Rym strategy of exaggeration.

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,185
Rym: My point is simple.

87
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:56,295
Scott: If you're going to exaggerate, you should just do what I do and do extreme hyperbole be like in the news for like a fucking 10 years.

88
00:03:56,315 --> 00:04:03,003
Rym: I don't think that was much of an exaggeration also because I noticed that news before we went and then it's still in the news now.

89
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:08,100
Scott: Anyway, so I had some boat full of people who came from a country I forget.

90
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,087
Rym: You don't remember any of the details.

91
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:18,255
Rym: So there's a wider problem in that Australia seems to have very liberal refugee laws compared to other countries.

92
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:33,565
Rym: And those laws appear to be fairly popular and the government seems to have been trying to not exactly follow the spirit of those laws because they don't want all these refugees being resettled inside of mainland Australia.

93
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,563
Rym: So they're trying to resettle refugees that are coming in and other places.

94
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,508
Rym: Like they tried to make a deal.

95
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,328
Rym: I think they did make a deal with a pop on New Guinea to have him go there instead.

96
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,526
Rym: And that seems to be what is generating the liberal outrage in Australia right now.

97
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:47,631
Scott: Yeah.

98
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:57,343
Scott: It's like we went to the fucking immigration museum in Australia, which is all about, look, Australia, you know, forgetting the aboriginal situation, right?

99
00:04:57,886 --> 00:05:00,798
Scott: Is a, it's like, look, this is a place that's pretty much all immigrants.

100
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:01,743
Scott: We all came here.

101
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,607
Scott: We let people in.

102
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:05,120
Scott: Look how awesome it is to let people in from all over the place.

103
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,702
Rym: Glad we went to.

104
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:10,405
Rym: that museum is the kind of, it was not a museum for people like us because we were foreigners.

105
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:11,310
Rym: We're not Australians.

106
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,264
Rym: And that was really, it'd be like if of someone who had no ties to the?

107
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:17,678
Rym: u s whatsoever in any part of their family came to the?

108
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:19,082
Rym: u s and went to Ellis Island.

109
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:19,804
Scott: Yeah.

110
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:29,600
Rym: But seeing what Australia presents to its own people on that issue was great because the whole museum was pretty much, yeah, look how fucking racist we were.

111
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,366
Rym: and yeah, we're still pretty racist.

112
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,132
Scott: Let people fucking in.

113
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:34,036
Scott: Jesus Christ.

114
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:34,497
Scott: Yep.

115
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:37,246
Rym: Or at least don't be really.

116
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:43,749
Rym: It wasn't that long ago that major political parties in Australia had a, they called it the white Australia policy.

117
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,271
Scott: Yeah.

118
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:47,202
Rym: Pretty much means exactly what it sounds like it means.

119
00:05:47,524 --> 00:06:00,210
Rym: So this is a big issue, but it seems like at least from the media, there's a lot of popular support for the refugees and for the sort of more liberal ideas around it and the government's all fighting about it.

120
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:02,722
Rym: And this was different nuances on this story.

121
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:05,500
Rym: We're in the forefront of the news for pretty much the entire time we were there.

122
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,741
Scott: Really?

123
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:11,368
Scott: If you're a modern country and someone wants to move to your country, just say yes, just say yes every time.

124
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:12,473
Scott: What's the fucking problem?

125
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:12,995
Scott: I don't get it.

126
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:14,722
Scott: If someone like Mexicans wants to come to the?

127
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,288
Scott: u s just let them in.

128
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:18,616
Rym: Uh, so you say we should have 100% open borders.

129
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:21,262
Scott: Yeah.

130
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,190
Rym: When I wouldn't cause any problem whatsoever.

131
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:23,733
Scott: Criminal.

132
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:24,275
Scott: All right.

133
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:28,856
Rym: So already you have to have a system to not let anyone in and vet them if you want that.

134
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,949
Scott: But you don't like set some number or something, right?

135
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:32,632
Scott: And if there's like,

136
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:55,107
Rym: you know, actually you kind of do to a degree, especially because people who immigrate fresh to a country tend to not go very far from where they came in and tend to settle in a very small number of places, which would put extreme load on local infrastructure and services coupled with the fact that u s uh, places don't really have very good social services for people who don't speak the language very well and don't have a lot of money.

137
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:56,352
Scott: Those people moved here.

138
00:06:56,372 --> 00:07:00,191
Scott: They do just moving from one piece of land to another piece of land.

139
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,598
Scott: If there's no infrastructure there.

140
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:01,739
Scott: Yeah.

141
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,889
Scott: You're the person who lives there.

142
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:08,125
Rym: What if more people than can comfortably and safely live in Finland want to go to Finland?

143
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,172
Rym: It's a small place.

144
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:11,536
Rym: Now watch these.

145
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:16,862
Rym: Let one, one person in and it literally pushes another person out into the water to those people that live there.

146
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:17,764
Scott: Right.

147
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:24,848
Scott: You know, to take care of New York used to not be able to handle that many people, but you know what?

148
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:28,204
Scott: Millions of people moved here and they built really big buildings.

149
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:31,374
Rym: There were decades of misery in here as a result.

150
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:32,317
Rym: This is earth.

151
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,335
Rym: Everywhere is miserable in this right now is only slightly miserable.

152
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:43,540
Scott: Basically say, okay, someone else is miserable and I'm happy, so I should keep that person miserable to maintain my happiness.

153
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,588
Scott: No, I'm saying that spread the misery more.

154
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:50,666
Rym: I'm saying that ridiculous idealism really falls flat in the face of basic pragmatism.

155
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:54,135
Rym: Anyway, anyway, this is a boat full of people.

156
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,151
Scott: There's no reason not to let this boat full of people move.

157
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:00,703
Rym: But that's not what the arguments were all about.

158
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:02,351
Rym: That boat was sort of a catalyst.

159
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:05,043
Rym: They're saying in general, what should the policy be?

160
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:12,157
Rym: Because there has been a fairly long standing flood of boat people, which is kind of what we've been calling people who came here from Cuba in the past.

161
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,609
Scott: Someone comes in Cuba, we should also let them in.

162
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,900
Scott: They voted all the way across the Caribbean.

163
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,933
Rym: What if everyone in all of Europe simultaneously decided to come here?

164
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:21,796
Scott: Sweet.

165
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:23,021
Rym: That wouldn't work.

166
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,747
Rym: There'd be mass starvation along the coasts.

167
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:25,731
Scott: Okay.

168
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:26,975
Rym: That's okay.

169
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:27,778
Scott: Yeah, I would.

170
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,572
Scott: People would come here and be like, oh, why did we come here?

171
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:31,739
Scott: And then they would move.

172
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,205
Rym: Where would they move?

173
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,238
Rym: They'd die of starvation before they could move.

174
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,048
Rym: There wouldn't be that much food along the coast anymore.

175
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:41,614
Scott: The point of people are moving away from a place is because they didn't like that place and had problems.

176
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:43,284
Scott: So they moved to a place that doesn't have problems.

177
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:47,007
Scott: If that place starts to have problems, people aren't going to be attracted to that place anymore.

178
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:51,548
Rym: And yet you did not want to do a Thursday show on immigration, but seemed to have a lot of opinions on immigration.

179
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:53,457
Rym: This is when the news.

180
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:56,327
Rym: Listener, should we do a show on immigration and continue this argument?

181
00:08:56,367 --> 00:09:01,023
Scott: You could say any idea and people say yes.

182
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:03,593
Scott: So do you want to do us to do a show on X?

183
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:04,497
Scott: The answer is yes.

184
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,229
Rym: Well, the letter X is not that it's not up to the listeners.

185
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:08,274
Scott: What should we do?

186
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:09,058
Rym: I say it should be.

187
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:10,102
Scott: No, let's do it.

188
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,734
Rym: Why shouldn't we just do whatever other people say.

189
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:13,959
Rym: Why deny them happiness?

190
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,924
Rym: Why say you don't get to have any input?

191
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:17,407
Rym: You individual person.

192
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:18,188
Scott: It's not your show.

193
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:24,483
Rym: It's see what I did there.

194
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,229
Rym: Let's move on.

195
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:40,714
Rym: What really struck me about the news in Australia was that this was in the news and the other item that I saw at the top of my national news and I was poking around every morning was a single gun murder.

196
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:52,336
Rym: I cannot imagine a situation in the U S where a single gun murder that doesn't have multiple political situations tied to it would make national news because there's a local gun murder.

197
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:57,297
Rym: That's single gun murder pretty much everywhere in the U S pretty much every day.

198
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:57,397
Rym: Yeah.

199
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:05,693
Scott: I mean, it's not as crazy gun shooting is like you would think from say Japanese people seem to think that everyone in the U S has guns for some reason.

200
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,980
Rym: A lot of us do have guns,

201
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,957
Scott: but yeah, it's like, yeah, that's a local news and not a national news,

202
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:21,625
Rym: but the fact that the national news had an article about the kind of shooting that would not even be the regional news in the U S says a lot about how effective gun control was at reducing gun violence in Australia.

203
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:25,140
Scott: Well, who knows about violence in general, but yeah, gun violence.

204
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,822
Scott: Yeah, it worked.

205
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:26,525
Scott: Yeah.

206
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,398
Rym: Regular violence is pretty low as well as far as I can tell.

207
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:38,931
Rym: Probably there's, uh, there's been an uptick according to the media in hooliganism and sort of bar fights and things like that among young white people.

208
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,160
Scott: Oh, well that's common everywhere.

209
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,300
Rym: And there was a bunch of racial tensions in the Western, Eastern part, Western part.

210
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,672
Rym: I forget what part already of Melbourne, the part of Melbourne.

211
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:52,048
Scott: There was some racial, racial tension across the tracks.

212
00:10:52,551 --> 00:11:03,300
Rym: I also learned that Melbourne very recently ended what was called, I think the gangland war where there were decades of gangland mafia murders and there's a huge, crazy history of mafia bullshit in Australia that I heard.

213
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,954
Scott: New York recently ended decade long history of gangland wars.

214
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,908
Scott: We didn't have a name recently entered the same way.

215
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:12,873
Rym: the Australian one was.

216
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:25,339
Rym: action was much more interesting because it was a sort of defined set of, it was kind of like a look back in history, the story of who was being murdered and why red like stories in America from the twenties.

217
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:31,440
Scott: I heard that LA recently sort of mostly ended a long decade, multi-decade history of gangland wars.

218
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,467
Rym: Actually, no, they didn't for one and two.

219
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:37,806
Rym: that's different kind of gang from the kind of gangs I'm talking about.

220
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:48,854
Rym: I'm just saying, I'm just saying they're two completely unrelated things, but anyway, things of the day.

221
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:55,734
Scott: So I found this video of a machine that makes the day are the only things in this episode that aren't Australian.

222
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:59,029
Rym: I could have found an Australian one if I tried hard enough.

223
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:02,445
Rym: I didn't even think to, and I haven't uploaded any pictures from the trip yet.

224
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:12,630
Rym: This is a machine that constructs the paper airplane from a single sheet of paper and then launches it and it appears to be able to do this in rapid fashion and I thought that was really cool.

225
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,172
Scott: It's awesome.

226
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:20,855
Rym: But then there was a love related video and that related video was actually pretty great.

227
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:34,624
Rym: Basically by this related video, I stumbled upon the community of people who is dedicated to making crazy origami paper airplanes out of single sheets of paper using no tools other than a single pencil or pen.

228
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:36,511
Scott: Yeah, I knew these people existed.

229
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:39,342
Scott: I knew, I assume they never searched for them on YouTube.

230
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:49,790
Rym: In fact, I interacted with them because when I was a kid, I did science Olympiad and one of the events had to do with making paper airplanes under similar constraints that would either go for distance or airtime.

231
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,045
Scott: In the paper airplane contest, I almost won for most flips, but I was short by one.

232
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:59,360
Scott: Mine went up and it went, and they hit the ground.

233
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,859
Rym: I made a pretty good paper airplane to compete that it was going for airtime.

234
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,802
Rym: It would go up in the air and it basically kind of circle very slowly for a long time and eventually come down.

235
00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:22,870
Rym: But the kid who beat me, I still don't know exactly what he made, but the airplane went up and just went across and up and then flipped over and went across the other way and up and flipped over and it did that basically forever.

236
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:24,936
Rym: It was up so long.

237
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:28,914
Rym: It was up more than double the time of any other airplane in the competition.

238
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:29,618
Rym: It was ridiculous.

239
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,718
Rym: And as soon as it ended, he walked over and he tore it up so no one could look at it.

240
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,991
Scott: We should YouTube the world record for that shit.

241
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:37,861
Scott: Oh wait, he tore it up so no one could look at it.

242
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:38,967
Scott: Cheating.

243
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:40,173
Scott: He was definitely cheating.

244
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,102
Scott: He might had a paper clip on that motherfucker or something.

245
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:43,892
Rym: No judges inspected them ahead of time.

246
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:44,696
Rym: They didn't want any.

247
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,308
Scott: He could have modified it after the inspection.

248
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,032
Scott: You got it.

249
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:48,433
Scott: That's why F1.

250
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,805
Scott: they inspect your car before and after the race.

251
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:54,001
Rym: They inspect it and they hand it back to you and you have to immediately launch it.

252
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:57,387
Rym: Anyway, uh, slate a hand.

253
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:06,707
Rym: So here is someone making the 12 a BAC TSR two out of paper and it's pretty off the hook.

254
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:09,255
Rym: However, warning motherfucker doesn't throw it.

255
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:13,026
Rym: So go to this video.

256
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:31,269
Rym: and if you ever doubted that there isn't a community for pretty much everything on the internet, go to this video and sometimes, you know, you'll get into the situation, you're poking around on YouTube and you hit that one video that is tied to a ghetto of the internet where from that point onward, every related video will just be related to that one thing and it's a loop from which you can never escape.

257
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:34,723
Scott: So here's a video that is super funny and awesome.

258
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:37,192
Scott: It is an MMA fight of some variety.

259
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:44,757
Scott: I can't tell which one and on one corner we have a small Japanese MMA guy, maybe 160 something pounds.

260
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:46,444
Rym: I like those kind of scrappy guys.

261
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,253
Scott: You know, he's lighter.

262
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:52,431
Scott: He weighs less than me, but he could definitely beat me up cause I have no strength whatsoever and my arm is broken.

263
00:14:53,456 --> 00:15:00,713
Scott: And in the other corner we have Emmanuel Yarbrough who weighs over 600 pounds.

264
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:03,017
Scott: A basically monster.

265
00:15:03,037 --> 00:15:08,838
Scott: Not as tall as Andre the giant, but I think he weighs more than Andre the giant did.

266
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:11,993
Rym: I think that was, that's what that mediocre commentator said at one point.

267
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:14,624
Scott: I think one of the commentators is Bas Rutten.

268
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:21,186
Scott: I'm not sure, but Bas Rutten is not mediocre person, but the commentary was mediocre.

269
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:21,648
Rym: I don't know.

270
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:22,312
Scott: I don't think so.

271
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:26,448
Scott: I've heard better kind of pretty average anyway, but yeah, you got to watch this.

272
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:27,391
Scott: This is crazy.

273
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:33,168
Scott: It's like, it's like rigging King Hippo or it looks like a boss fight.

274
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:34,291
Rym: Attack on Titan.

275
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:34,872
Scott: Oh my God.

276
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,875
Scott: Attack a ton.

277
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:40,857
Rym: I got to take that video and just add the attack on Titan theme to and re upload it.

278
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,002
Scott: It might already have been.

279
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:44,749
Rym: If it hasn't, I'm going to do that before we go to Wildwood.

280
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:45,511
Rym: I'll.

281
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,537
Rym: it's like a boss fight from one of those walk around and hit people.

282
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:55,114
Rym: Games are like a resident evil where there's the lumbering monster in the middle.

283
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:55,797
Rym: That's huge.

284
00:15:55,857 --> 00:16:01,427
Rym: That is slowly coming at you and you got to keep kiting it because as soon as you stop cutting it, it just punches you and say hiding.

285
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:01,990
Scott: How are you playing?

286
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,364
Rym: the mob is now with that term has been around for a while.

287
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:06,307
Scott: Uh huh.

288
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:06,949
Rym: Yeah.

289
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,778
Rym: Now I'm, I have tried the mobas.

290
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,304
Rym: Don't like the mobas still.

291
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:13,455
Rym: We'll talk about the mobas at some point in the future.

292
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:16,505
Rym: Might talk about them in our bad games, panel of packs.

293
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,720
Scott: Anyway, man met a moment in the meta moment.

294
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,394
Rym: We're back from Australia and we're about to go to packs.

295
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:26,759
Rym: We're on Monday at noon.

296
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,572
Rym: We're going to be presenting bad games in the theater.

297
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:39,972
Scott: You should probably, instead of going to bad games, there's like a Robert coup interviewing Mike and Jerry panel, which was originally scheduled as mystery panel, but then they revealed it.

298
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:42,366
Rym: You know what mystery panel, you know what they're doing?

299
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:43,814
Rym: They're doing the same shit.

300
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:45,965
Rym: We used to do a ConnectiCon with the crab people panel.

301
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:46,607
Scott: Yup.

302
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:49,097
Rym: The, well, we can't fill this hole now.

303
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:52,813
Rym: Let's assume we'll have something good to put there and we're competing with that.

304
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:54,320
Rym: So that's fine.

305
00:16:55,943 --> 00:17:02,045
Rym: Uh, I think we'll be fine because one, you guys all know what we're going to say in a bad games panel.

306
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:05,540
Rym: I kind of want people who don't know who we are to show up to this thing.

307
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,464
Rym: They're unlikely to cause they'll be at the anyway now cause that thing can only hold so many people.

308
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:10,711
Scott: It's also Monday at noon.

309
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,099
Scott: I don't know what Monday is going to be like.

310
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,507
Rym: I think the whole con is sold out.

311
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:18,140
Scott: So I know anyway, what else is in the meta moment?

312
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,076
Rym: The book club book is very apropos to what is going on in the U S right now.

313
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:29,629
Rym: And while we always assume that this shit was going down in the U S now there's evidence of it kind of mad that people aren't mad about it.

314
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,380
Rym: So I hope that you guys read this and get mad.

315
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,404
Scott: They weren't mad before.

316
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:33,529
Scott: Why would they be mad now?

317
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:38,531
Rym: Maybe because they lack the imagination to really think about what, where this road goes.

318
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,399
Rym: Cause it's not nowhere.

319
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:50,138
Rym: Uh, other than that, after packs, there's going to be kind of a calm down period.

320
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:52,370
Rym: I don't know if we'll go to the New York comic con.

321
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,476
Rym: We skipped it last year.

322
00:17:53,617 --> 00:17:55,185
Rym: Kind of done with the New York comic con.

323
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,722
Scott: There's nothing really there that I need to say, but there will be mad.

324
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:02,171
Rym: I'm doing it quiet.

325
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,437
Rym: Like it's too soon.

326
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:06,022
Scott: You can hear the mag fest in the distance.

327
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,870
Scott: It's out there.

328
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,914
Scott: It's a few months down the road.

329
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:12,608
Rym: I kind of want to make a YouTube video on how to do the mag fest.

330
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:14,193
Rym: Roar at mag fest.

331
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:20,579
Rym: Do it like video, other people doing it and make the thing because mag fest is going to be off the hook and crazy.

332
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:20,800
Rym: Awesome.

333
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,462
Rym: Like it always is.

334
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:22,988
Rym: We will be there doing our usual thing.

335
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,537
Scott: And so will so well.

336
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:26,480
Rym: Oh right.

337
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,555
Rym: Machine supremacy or you may incorrectly know them as mock and I supremacy.

338
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:39,944
Scott: You may, but they have never before in the history of the universe performed music in the United States of America.

339
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:43,861
Rym: If I had to say one thing to convince you to go to mag fest, it would be this.

340
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:45,707
Rym: I love packs.

341
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:49,720
Rym: If you can't tell Scott packs is a big part of every pack since away.

342
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,853
Rym: We flew to fucking Australia to go to PAX Australia.

343
00:18:53,873 --> 00:19:01,262
Scott: If mag fest was at the same time as PAX Australia with machine supremacy being there, I probably would not have gone to Austria.

344
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:10,088
Rym: Pax aside, mag fest is the best gaming convention in the Western hemisphere and two PAX Australia packs.

345
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,352
Scott: You've never even been to Gen Con.

346
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:15,624
Rym: Oh, mag fest has a better arcade than packs.

347
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:19,013
Rym: true to a degree that is painful to behold.

348
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:19,555
Rym: True.

349
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:23,087
Rym: Pax has a tiny little room with some arcade machines in it.

350
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:29,153
Rym: Mag fest has a football field of arcade machines and Scott will tell you, I am not exaggerating at all.

351
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:29,635
Scott: It's true.

352
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:30,980
Rym: It is a football field.

353
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,023
Scott: 100% true.

354
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:32,585
Rym: It is.

355
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,811
Rym: It is ridiculous.

356
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:37,546
Rym: Last year they had one of those VR machines that used to be in malls in the nineties.

357
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:38,772
Rym: Just hanging out.

358
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:40,037
Rym: It was just hanging out.

359
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:43,150
Rym: You just fucking walk up and be like, Hey, I want to play this and be like, okay.

360
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:43,873
Scott: Yeah.

361
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:45,700
Scott: Mag fest is awesome.

362
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:46,846
Scott: You should check us.

363
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:51,694
Scott: If you're listening to this podcast, you should know that we're all over the internets and all the places that are on the internets.

364
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:56,456
Scott: So go to all your favorite internet places, all your social networks and our websites and all those things.

365
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,916
Scott: And if you go to frontrowcrew.com, you can have help finding those places.

366
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:04,149
Rym: Also, we're slowly uploading videos from Connecticut and packs.

367
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,236
Scott: Australia is one of those places.

368
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:23,604
Rym: Lots of our old lectures are on YouTube and, and, and, and we're actually doing another show called a GeekNights presents shoujo kakame Utena, where we're going through a 39 episode anime and talking about each episode for longer than the episode runs, seems to be moderately popular.

369
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:28,567
Rym: And if you guys spread it around, the more views it gets, the more likely we are to do it faster.

370
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:31,620
Scott: Well, we're likely to do it faster after PAX Prime.

371
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,975
Rym: We're going to try to at least record some episodes before PAX Prime.

372
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,782
Rym: So we'll see where that goes.

373
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:38,564
Scott: All right.

374
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,614
Scott: So back to Australia, the land down under.

375
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,367
Scott: There were no poison things, not anywhere near us.

376
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:46,831
Scott: I didn't even see a big spider.

377
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:54,475
Rym: The flight in my opinion was easier and better and more pleasant than when I fly to Mumbai.

378
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,593
Scott: Oh, I didn't fly to Mumbai so I can't compare because my flight to Mumbai is one shot.

379
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:01,620
Rym: There's no layover.

380
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:07,117
Rym: The layover in LA before I get on the flight to Melbourne actually really helped.

381
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,964
Scott: It didn't help me that one.

382
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:12,602
Rym: It gave me an accused to walk around a whole very annoying on the way back.

383
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:15,776
Scott: That layover going through customs, getting my bags and putting them back.

384
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,483
Scott: That was a pain in the ass.

385
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,870
Rym: That was a, that was a super pain in the ass.

386
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:20,231
Scott: Yeah.

387
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:27,712
Rym: But two because the time zone change is pretty much the other side of the world.

388
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:29,557
Rym: Zero jet lag.

389
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:42,263
Rym: Well, literally I woke up, you know, on the plane and had breakfast and then we got out of the airport and it was like late morning, early afternoon in Melbourne on Thursday and I was fine around 10 o'clock.

390
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:47,045
Rym: I was like, let's go to bed, went to sleep, woke up the next morning and I was in Australia time.

391
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:47,467
Rym: Yeah.

392
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:57,491
Scott: I mean, I set my watch when I got on the plane to Australia time and then the plane seemed to be operating on Australia time cause they gave us dinner like right away when it was dinner time in Australia.

393
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:58,255
Rym: That's the secret.

394
00:21:58,396 --> 00:22:00,166
Rym: And I tweeted this in a bunch of people.

395
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:03,424
Scott: I even tweeted and then they gave us breakfast during his breakfast time in Australia.

396
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:08,665
Rym: All of you who experienced jet lag, I have so simple advice that will save you.

397
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,136
Rym: Do whatever the plane is telling you to do.

398
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:12,784
Rym: The airlines have this shit figured out.

399
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:13,005
Rym: Yeah.

400
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:19,634
Scott: And then like after dinner I did some stuff for a little bit and then I went to bed and then I woke up and it was breakfast.

401
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:21,562
Rym: You're on a plane and they serve dinner.

402
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:21,944
Rym: Eat it.

403
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,396
Rym: No matter what, if they bring you food, eat all of it.

404
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:27,754
Rym: If they ask you if you want water, you say yes, you drink that goddamn water.

405
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,564
Rym: If the lights are on, you stay awake.

406
00:22:29,604 --> 00:22:31,073
Rym: If the lights are off, you go to sleep.

407
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:32,743
Scott: They made everyone close all the windows.

408
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:34,514
Scott: They didn't let you control your little plane window.

409
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:37,108
Rym: If the lights go off and you can't sleep, close your eyes.

410
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:38,195
Rym: Just lay there anyway.

411
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:38,818
Scott: That's what I did.

412
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:42,071
Scott: I was because even though I could sleep, I was tired.

413
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:46,246
Scott: I basically have trouble sleeping, sitting up, even reclining the stupid.

414
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:48,232
Rym: I have no trouble with that reclining chair.

415
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:49,095
Scott: Thank glob.

416
00:22:50,519 --> 00:23:01,344
Scott: So I was just sort of, you know, uncomfortably drifting in and out, but that was, you know, it was shitty sleep, but it was sleep and I was rested when we landed and I did the same thing on the way back.

417
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:03,595
Rym: So Melbourne airport, whatever, all normal.

418
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:06,466
Scott: It's the first time for their gigantic duty free.

419
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:09,437
Rym: Uh, that was not a gigantic duty.

420
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:11,064
Scott: That's the biggest duty free I've ever seen.

421
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:13,354
Rym: That was an average size duty free.

422
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:18,400
Scott: It was like they make you, as you're walking to the gate, you have to go through this incredible duty free like Wonderland.

423
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:19,262
Rym: Yeah.

424
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:23,594
Rym: Fly through a Tokyo or something sometime or go to Istanbul.

425
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:24,276
Scott: Okay.

426
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:28,129
Scott: But it's like, why would anyone buy this full priced garbage?

427
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,284
Rym: So we landed and we got a bunch of Australian money from an ATM.

428
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:33,971
Scott: Australian money is awesome.

429
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:35,598
Rym: Australian money is the best one.

430
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:39,008
Rym: The default bill is the 50 not the 20 to.

431
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:43,362
Scott: the bills are different colors and different sizes for blind people.

432
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:43,684
Rym: Three.

433
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:50,471
Rym: They have a really cool, clear part on them and every vending machine and everything takes cash and it just works every time.

434
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:57,120
Rym: The coins are great because they don't have pennies and while they're not having pennies is great, but the coins are flawed.

435
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,266
Rym: I don't think they're flawed.

436
00:23:58,488 --> 00:23:58,890
Scott: They're okay.

437
00:23:58,911 --> 00:23:59,696
Scott: So here's the one thing, right?

438
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:01,526
Rym: I think they're in fact the opposite.

439
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:05,505
Scott: It's good that the gold money is worth something and the silver money isn't right.

440
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:08,520
Scott: So you can easily separate worthwhile money from unworthwhile money.

441
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,953
Scott: But why is the $2 coins smaller than the $1?

442
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:12,796
Scott: easily?

443
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:16,450
Rym: Because you're going to carry a lot more one and $2 coins around because they're useful.

444
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,663
Rym: I need any big coins that you get by accident.

445
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:22,094
Rym: You leave his tip the next chance you get.

446
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:25,025
Scott: But I'm saying, why were the twos smaller than the one?

447
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:34,085
Rym: Because you're going to carry more of them than you are ones because that they're, that the smallest bill is a five and they don't even seem to ever give you fives and change.

448
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,916
Rym: They just give you a pile of those coins and you know what?

449
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:39,698
Rym: I did an audit of my pockets because this is an issue that really bothers me.

450
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:40,160
Rym: The fact that the?

451
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,963
Rym: u s still has pennies.

452
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:50,717
Rym: One, I noted that pretty much because tax is already included and everything, prices are proud into the nearest dollar pretty much everywhere.

453
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:52,866
Rym: Maybe the nearest 50 cents.

454
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,574
Scott: There was one or two times or something.

455
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,006
Scott: It was like nine 95 and I was seriously 95.

456
00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:58,854
Scott: I haven't seen that in this country anywhere.

457
00:24:59,095 --> 00:24:59,316
Scott: Yes.

458
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,768
Rym: I almost never saw, I got maybe three or four nickels.

459
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:04,433
Scott: It's like, yeah, the tax is built in.

460
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:08,571
Scott: So I got a nickel and change and I was like, really?

461
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:08,812
Rym: Yeah.

462
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:09,999
Rym: Those are the only times they got nickels.

463
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,963
Rym: But my car, my pockets had fewer coins in them on average that were annoying than I have in the u s.

464
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:23,935
Scott: I had a lot of coins in my pockets that were annoying, but I then I would just dump them all out because they were these worthless silver coins.

465
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:27,189
Rym: I didn't get a lot of those silver coins because I left them for tips everywhere.

466
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:39,074
Rym: Anyway, the $2 coin, the u s should get rid of the one and $2 bill, replace them in one and $2 coins, get rid of the quarter and replace it with the much superior 20 cent coin.

467
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:41,624
Rym: That 20 cent coin was so much better.

468
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:45,078
Scott: I didn't use any, any silver coin at any point to pay for anything.

469
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,904
Rym: I use my 50 cent coins a lot too.

470
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:50,737
Scott: I took a stack of 50 cent coins and use them to buy.

471
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:54,154
Scott: Uh, they came out to a bunch of dollars when I was at the base.

472
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:57,551
Scott: I put all those useless coins in a bag and I took them with me home.

473
00:25:57,571 --> 00:26:02,853
Scott: And when I was at the airport about to leave, I took all the big 50 cent coins and bought like two candy bars.

474
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:05,566
Scott: And I was like, Oh, got rid of those big fuckers.

475
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:16,152
Rym: So we got out of the airport, we check in our hotel, we wander around Melbourne and we decide that we want to get some food and we walk around.

476
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:24,388
Rym: And the of meat raft in pastry bread.

477
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:26,092
Scott: That was most of the food.

478
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,817
Scott: That was the default food.

479
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:27,918
Rym: Yeah.

480
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,992
Rym: The secondary default food was the sandwich.

481
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:37,616
Rym: And I got to tell you, we live in New York, which is while not the king of submarine sandwiches, cause we don't have them.

482
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:40,028
Scott: The king of other sandwiches, normal sandwiches.

483
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:44,991
Rym: New York was until this point, the king, but Australia or at least Melbourne, my hat is off to you.

484
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:45,734
Scott: Well, okay.

485
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:49,692
Scott: So if you're talking like Carnegie deli, it's like, no, my hat is not off to you.

486
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,260
Scott: You didn't have a competition for that.

487
00:26:51,380 --> 00:27:00,517
Scott: But if you're talking about the average place, right, you just walk into a deli or a cafe and they have that little refer display case refrigerator that has sandwiches in it.

488
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:09,478
Scott: Usually in New York, when you go to one of those places that has a display case refrigerator with sandwiches in it, it's all the same paninis, the same wraps, the same sandwiches.

489
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:13,092
Scott: They all look really bland and mediocre.

490
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,417
Scott: Like, yeah, I could eat that.

491
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:15,340
Scott: It won't poison me.

492
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,777
Scott: It will taste fine, but it is not something I want or would actively seek out.

493
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:20,600
Scott: Oh my God.

494
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,403
Rym: I ate way.

495
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,854
Rym: I had a lot of sandwiches just because they look so good.

496
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:30,623
Scott: Almost every place I saw with the display case, refrigerator had sandwiches that were obviously made at that place.

497
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:37,150
Scott: They were using a high quality bread and high quality ingredients and a clever and interesting flavorful combination.

498
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:39,500
Rym: Those sandwiches were so good, but they got nothing.

499
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:47,070
Rym: They looked like restaurant presentable, but I didn't eat as many of them as I wanted to because I kept getting meat pies instead.

500
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,720
Scott: I ate, tried to eat a nice mix of things.

501
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:53,032
Rym: But I got different kinds of meat pies and I was amazed.

502
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:55,240
Scott: I had a curry one and I had a lamb.

503
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,764
Rym: There were pasties.

504
00:27:56,784 --> 00:28:12,211
Rym: I vote the pasties seem to exist in a small number of places in the world, a small number of places in the United Kingdom, Albion, the Northern upper peninsula of Michigan, and apparently all of Eastern Australia.

505
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:13,535
Rym: pasties.

506
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:14,197
Rym: Look them up.

507
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:14,839
Rym: They're delicious.

508
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:17,772
Rym: You might've heard of them in Neil Gaiman's, uh, American gods.

509
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:19,560
Rym: That's where most people seem to learn.

510
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,503
Rym: the pasties exist.

511
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:25,399
Rym: But, uh, all that food stuff aside, we decided to eat at this pub.

512
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:26,545
Rym: They're like, Oh, we'll get some pub food.

513
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:27,349
Rym: And there was this prefix.

514
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:27,992
Rym: that looked pretty good.

515
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:30,766
Rym: And this is when our adventure began.

516
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:34,042
Rym: This was the first point where we ran into culture that was different from our own.

517
00:28:35,406 --> 00:28:36,791
Rym: There was a surreal experience.

518
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:40,484
Rym: We only had one other surreal experience the whole time we were in this country.

519
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:46,302
Rym: So we go into this pub and we walk in and it's not really clear where to go.

520
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:48,414
Rym: There's like a bar area and there's some people hanging out.

521
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:51,166
Scott: Well, it's sort of a weird in between lunch and dinner time.

522
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:51,588
Scott: Yep.

523
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,460
Rym: But there was a prefix thing like advertised outside.

524
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,667
Rym: It was pretty cheap and it looked good.

525
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:58,021
Rym: It was like pub food, like bangers and mash and that kind of stuff.

526
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:01,695
Rym: And we kind of look around and go, there's one bartender.

527
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:03,100
Rym: So like, yeah, how do we get food?

528
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,892
Rym: And she's like, Oh, you can sit up here or you can sit downstairs.

529
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:11,840
Scott: It's like, okay, so go to the middle floor where it seems like there's an actual restaurant and it's basically dark and closed.

530
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:15,655
Scott: Yeah, we go even lower and it's a basically, it's really a bar.

531
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:19,090
Rym: There's just a bar down there and there's a bunch of guys hanging out with the bartender.

532
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:25,333
Scott: It was so stereotypical, like a thing you would see on TV, like people hanging out behind around the bar, talking wise.

533
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:33,357
Rym: This is a weekday during the day after lunchtime, but long before anyone gets off work.

534
00:29:33,678 --> 00:29:40,525
Rym: And there's a bunch of guys like 10 of them just hanging out, doing basically reenacting a scene from a movie that would be going on in the background.

535
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:45,725
Rym: So kind of walk in and they all stop and look at us like, and then they go back to their business.

536
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:47,091
Rym: We sit down for a while.

537
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,401
Rym: It's not obvious how to order food.

538
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:49,622
Scott: Yeah.

539
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:53,278
Scott: They asked us like, you know, we're like, should we go upstairs?

540
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,309
Scott: Like, well, you shouldn't go to the middle cause that's closed.

541
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:56,234
Scott: They're like, all right.

542
00:29:56,676 --> 00:30:00,757
Scott: So you sit down at a table and no one really talks to us or anything and North tries to serve us.

543
00:30:00,797 --> 00:30:02,465
Scott: So like, Oh yes, this isn't how you get food.

544
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:02,928
Rym: Yup.

545
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,154
Rym: There were no menus or anything.

546
00:30:04,174 --> 00:30:11,060
Rym: So eventually we just kind of walk back upstairs and go to the regular part and we'd go to the bartender and ask for food.

547
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,507
Scott: Cause no one came to ask us.

548
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:12,890
Scott: Yup.

549
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,136
Rym: And then after that it was fine.

550
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:15,222
Rym: So we get our good food, we're eating it.

551
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:20,827
Rym: There's people hanging out and there's a mix of people in this bar, like a surprising panoply of people.

552
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:32,739
Rym: And then a panoply, a gentleman, not a panoply, a gentleman, an elderly gentleman where dressed in that sort of shabby but fine way.

553
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,293
Rym: Like he was wearing fine clothes that just looked like they were kind of old and worn out.

554
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:42,338
Rym: And you're wearing like a jacket and he walks in and he bows to everyone and sits down at the piano.

555
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:45,150
Rym: that's there and just starts singing the kind of song.

556
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,603
Scott: Well he asked the bartender if he could play the piano, if it would be all right.

557
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:48,964
Rym: Yup.

558
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,590
Rym: And she was like, you know, no worries.

559
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:52,036
Rym: Go for it.

560
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:59,400
Rym: And he just starts playing at the piano and then he sings what I can only describe as a British pub song.

561
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:02,251
Scott: I don't even remember the song, but it was weird.

562
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:09,201
Rym: It was one of those songs that like you'd expect someone to sing and a bunch of people are singing along with them around a piano in a movie from the twenties.

563
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:14,158
Rym: And then he stops playing and he gets up, bows to everyone and just walks out.

564
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:22,682
Scott: He said something to us about like, you know, he was like a performer and his stage is the street or something like that.

565
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,949
Rym: He kind of sounded like James Mason.

566
00:31:25,672 --> 00:31:28,882
Scott: He was, you know, a weird eccentric kind of guy.

567
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:32,754
Rym: And all this just kind of happened while we were trying to get lunch in this pub.

568
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:41,565
Rym: And then we get our meal, we leave like a $20 tip and we go to walk out and the bartender's like, Whoa, what are you guys doing?

569
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:42,229
Scott: Come back here.

570
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:42,872
Scott: We're like, what?

571
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,240
Rym: There's no tipping in this country.

572
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,524
Rym: I am paid very well.

573
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:46,247
Scott: Yeah.

574
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,478
Scott: Apparently ever the minimum wage is really good there.

575
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:49,779
Rym: Yeah.

576
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:52,691
Rym: For service people it's like 20, 25 bucks an hour.

577
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,519
Scott: Well, it's a bit, you know, it varies.

578
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:57,410
Rym: service like, like that kind of hospitality.

579
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,334
Scott: It's some number.

580
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:01,888
Scott: Apparently it goes, it can be like, if you're a high school kid, it can be way low, like $8.

581
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:10,990
Scott: And if you're, you know, have, you know, as if you have more and more years of working, it goes up and up and it can be like, I think it's around 16, $18, something like that.

582
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,388
Rym: But it seems like all the bartenders and waiters and people make 20, 25 bucks an hour.

583
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:15,669
Scott: Yeah.

584
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,462
Scott: People are getting paid real money there, so they don't need your tip.

585
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:22,801
Scott: And there's also things like reward wages, which I still can't figure out what those are.

586
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:26,295
Rym: And also they were almost as complicated as the Mikey card.

587
00:32:26,315 --> 00:32:26,435
Scott: Yeah.

588
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:34,145
Scott: There's also concessions, which is like, if you, I guess if you're old or infirm or concessions, I figured out pretty quick were oldenings.

589
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:34,828
Scott: Yeah.

590
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,651
Scott: It's, you know, social security or something, but it's like, they would always be on everything, but have concession prices.

591
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,340
Scott: It'd be like, Oh, you want to buy this?

592
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,564
Scott: It costs 10 bucks.

593
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,110
Scott: concessions, six bucks.

594
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:50,436
Scott: And it's like, what old people just, you know, seniors, it's like senior citizen discount, social security, et cetera.

595
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:51,682
Rym: This is why I said the money is fine.

596
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:52,566
Rym: Cause what did she say?

597
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:55,460
Rym: She said, you leave a tip of pretty much all your silver money.

598
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,121
Scott: Yeah.

599
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:58,755
Rym: So all your 50 cent and 20 cent coins, you just leave them.

600
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:00,242
Rym: And that's, that's the tip you leave.

601
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:04,000
Rym: And while we're standing there, this old gentleman at the bar is like, Americans, eh?

602
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,271
Rym: And we're like, you couldn't tell from our accent.

603
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,180
Scott: He was like, you'll give yourself away.

604
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:10,753
Scott: tipping like that is for tourists tipping like that.

605
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:12,723
Scott: I'm like, Oh, our accents won't give us away.

606
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:16,200
Rym: And then we were like, so what's the, what's the only thing we could do to offend people here?

607
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,557
Rym: And there were, and the guy was basically like, try to do an Australian accent.

608
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:20,421
Scott: That's not how it was.

609
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:21,968
Scott: I said, what should I do?

610
00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:23,534
Scott: Should I fake an Australian accent?

611
00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:25,402
Scott: And he was like, no, no, no, no, no.

612
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:25,824
Scott: Good day.

613
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:26,125
Rym: Good day.

614
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:26,367
Rym: Good day.

615
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:26,608
Rym: Good day.

616
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:27,050
Rym: Good day.

617
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,371
Rym: Good day.

618
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:27,874
Rym: Yeah.

619
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:28,476
Rym: Good on you.

620
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:29,862
Scott: You know, whatever.

621
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:31,067
Scott: I never heard anyone say that.

622
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:32,815
Rym: I heard several people say it.

623
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:35,145
Rym: Enforcers seem to be saying it a lot.

624
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:36,491
Scott: They would say no worries.

625
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:37,596
Rym: That's got to be like, Oh, don't worry.

626
00:33:37,637 --> 00:33:38,280
Rym: I got this up.

627
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,083
Rym: And they gotta be like it on you.

628
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:44,309
Rym: I helped, uh, I helped coo move a chair at one point just cause he was trying to move a chair and he couldn't get it unlocked.

629
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:47,105
Rym: And some enforcer came over and like was trying to help too.

630
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:48,415
Rym: And he saw me and he was like, Oh, good on you.

631
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:49,079
Rym: And then he walked away.

632
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,081
Rym: Yeah.

633
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:57,488
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, then we went to packs, then we went to bags, bags, bags, bags, bags, well, no way you missed a very important part.

634
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:02,393
Scott: So we spent the other part of that day walking around, just walking around the city, walking around, looking around.

635
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:06,991
Rym: Scott almost got hit by a car immediately because he looked right instead of left to jaywalk.

636
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:07,674
Scott: That happens.

637
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:11,387
Rym: Also, people don't really jaywalk in Melbourne.

638
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:17,387
Rym: And the reason for this is because cars are actually going pretty fucking fast there because traffic's not that bad.

639
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:22,164
Scott: And also the street lights does super help for the blind there.

640
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:24,130
Scott: So like if I'm blind, I'm moving there.

641
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:29,654
Scott: Cause every street, like the buttons to tell you when to cross and the lights and the Tokyo's like that.

642
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:30,337
Rym: So is Istanbul.

643
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:30,759
Scott: All right.

644
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:32,063
Scott: The bumps on the sidewalk.

645
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:32,446
Scott: Yeah.

646
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:33,770
Scott: Way better than in New York.

647
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,396
Rym: So is fucking Mumbai.

648
00:34:35,818 --> 00:34:42,402
Scott: But I got way used to it because I was busy using the noise to tell me when to cross the street and not the lights.

649
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:45,197
Scott: And I was worried that I would get messed up when I came back to New York.

650
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:49,739
Rym: I realized the reason I wouldn't mess this up is because we don't look at the lights in the U S either.

651
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,382
Scott: That's right.

652
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:53,715
Rym: But yeah, you can't, it's actually kind of dangerous to jaywalk.

653
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:58,816
Scott: Also there's trams like actual trends, all these pictures everywhere that you're like rhinoceroses.

654
00:34:58,836 --> 00:34:59,719
Rym: Oh my God.

655
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,006
Rym: That rhino picture was the best.

656
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:05,006
Scott: And it's basically trying to say like, look, the tram weighs as much as like a bunch of rhinos.

657
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,110
Scott: Don't get hit by it.

658
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:07,294
Rym: Yeah.

659
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:11,049
Rym: So mass transit in Melbourne, they don't have a subway, which kind of sort of did.

660
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,077
Rym: The subway has five stations.

661
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:17,295
Scott: It's basically, from what I could tell, it wasn't used because they're building it right now.

662
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:17,657
Rym: Yeah.

663
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:21,214
Rym: It's supposed, it's going to connect all the major transit centers inside of the city, apparently.

664
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:24,647
Rym: And they've got light rail and they've got trams.

665
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,618
Rym: The trams do not replace subways of New York.

666
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,686
Rym: had these trams into the subways to have those trams.

667
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:31,187
Rym: Yes.

668
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:37,846
Rym: Those trams, each tram in a fully loaded situation holds fewer people than one subway car.

669
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:38,307
Scott: Correct.

670
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:42,061
Rym: But they run pretty much constantly and they're really good.

671
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:46,916
Rym: My take on these trams is that they do not replace real mass transit.

672
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:53,595
Rym: New York needs the subway, but they augment mass transit because they replace walking.

673
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:54,136
Scott: Right.

674
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:59,797
Scott: So a lot of times, so for example, the S subway that could be replaced by a tram, right?

675
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:02,429
Scott: You know, it's the, you can just cross town walking.

676
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:08,014
Scott: So it's like if you're walking and you have to walk three blocks from the subway station to a place, well you would start walking.

677
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:12,112
Scott: And if a tram happened to pass, you would get on it and then it would take you the rest of the way.

678
00:36:12,132 --> 00:36:18,474
Scott: And I think, you know, based on another piece of evidence, everyone there walked really slow.

679
00:36:18,494 --> 00:36:18,895
Rym: Oh my God.

680
00:36:19,256 --> 00:36:19,557
Rym: Oh my God.

681
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,608
Rym: You people walk slower than Tennesseans.

682
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:23,251
Scott: Right.

683
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:33,801
Scott: So the fact that they walk so slow, I think is because the tram is augmenting their walking or as New Yorkers walk fast because we don't have a train.

684
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:35,146
Rym: Just about anything.

685
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:50,829
Rym: If New York city implemented trams going cross town in Manhattan only just back and forth 24 seven and in that nebulous area between Queens and Brooklyn, like that area, if there were trams just going up and down every street there, that would make New York city the best ever beyond

686
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:51,592
Scott: what it already is.

687
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:56,280
Scott: You know what would be so great about that is they see all the slow people would get on those and I would walk and the sidewalk could be empty.

688
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,081
Rym: Yeah.

689
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,530
Scott: So I could get there even faster just by walking.

690
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:09,468
Rym: So we wanted to use the tram and we'd been warned ahead of time that you can't like, it's not like New York where there's a thing to buy a Metro card in every subway station.

691
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:16,390
Rym: You can't buy Mikey cards basically anywhere you could get on a tram or a train.

692
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:22,149
Scott: There were a couple of tram stations that had the machine, but not many in seven 11.

693
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:22,370
Scott: Yeah.

694
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,880
Scott: You buy them in seven 11 or you buy them at like the huge stations.

695
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:39,538
Rym: Now I thought, because I have an anecdote from our friend Adam where, you know, he had a friend from New York that has a real subway system and that friend was visiting him in DC and he told him, take the red line to station named X. And the friend was like, what do you mean?

696
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:41,566
Rym: red line, like uptown downtown?

697
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:42,410
Rym: What, like, what?

698
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:43,816
Rym: And I was like, are you seriously?

699
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:44,640
Rym: You're from New York.

700
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:50,303
Rym: If you look at a map at any station in DC, it will look like the New York subway map drawn with crayons.

701
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:51,086
Rym: You'll figure it out.

702
00:37:51,106 --> 00:37:54,860
Scott: The DC Metro is Fisher Price first subway.

703
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,244
Rym: Baby's first subway.

704
00:37:57,928 --> 00:38:00,917
Rym: So I figured, and Scott also figured we're New Yorkers.

705
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:02,822
Rym: I'm looking at my Metro card right now.

706
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:09,240
Rym: How hard can this other modern urban centers transit system be to figure out?

707
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,503
Rym: And we stood there.

708
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:13,855
Scott: I still don't 100% know all the rules of it.

709
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:16,525
Rym: I feel like sometimes I should touch off, but not always.

710
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:17,148
Scott: Right.

711
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:18,473
Scott: So here's the deal with it, right?

712
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:22,209
Scott: Is they've sort of done something that the New York didn't do in New York.

713
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,783
Scott: A Metro card will only get you on a bus or a subway.

714
00:38:24,863 --> 00:38:26,612
Rym: It won't get you on Metro North, the light rail.

715
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:29,022
Rym: It won't get you on special express bus.

716
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:30,247
Scott: It won't get you on the path.

717
00:38:30,748 --> 00:38:31,752
Scott: It won't get you on air train.

718
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:32,073
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't.

719
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:38,040
Scott: Well, it will get you on air train, but only if you have dollars, not if you have infinite swipes.

720
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,035
Rym: Now they gave you a way to put dollars on an infinite swipe card.

721
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:41,376
Scott: Did they?

722
00:38:41,517 --> 00:38:41,758
Scott: Yeah.

723
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,141
Scott: I didn't know.

724
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,294
Rym: that's putting an infinite swipe card and you can add cash to it.

725
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:44,777
Scott: Oh, nice.

726
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:45,341
Scott: I didn't know that.

727
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:45,582
Scott: All right.

728
00:38:45,602 --> 00:38:50,562
Scott: So, but anyway, uh, but yeah, in New York, you don't use the Metro card for everything.

729
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:52,271
Scott: You just use it for a certain set of things.

730
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:55,187
Scott: And because you only use it for a certain set of things, it's really simple.

731
00:38:55,227 --> 00:38:56,795
Scott: You swipe it and you're in the system.

732
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,870
Scott: You can now ride as much as you want until you leave the system.

733
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,909
Scott: If you want to get back into the subway, you swipe, and it's always the same price to swipe.

734
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:07,224
Scott: And no matter how far you go, no matter where you go, it's just pay to get in.

735
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:09,573
Scott: And when you leave, you pay to get back in.

736
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:12,244
Rym: Now I'm reasonably okay with the alternate system.

737
00:39:12,304 --> 00:39:16,943
Rym: Some cities have a, you put your card in, you go in and then you swipe again on your way out.

738
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:17,585
Scott: Yup.

739
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:19,892
Scott: Like DC Metro, you put a ticket in the thing.

740
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:20,975
Scott: It lets you in.

741
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:23,746
Scott: then on your way out, you can't get out.

742
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:24,892
Scott: You put your ticket in the thing.

743
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:26,580
Scott: It sucks it in and it lets you out.

744
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,453
Scott: So it's, it's, you can't not figure out how it works.

745
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:34,752
Scott: You buy a ticket to where you're going and the turnstiles force you to obey the system.

746
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,437
Rym: So we stare at this thing.

747
00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:38,403
Rym: We can't figure it out for the life of us.

748
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:41,635
Scott: So finally is Mikey pass and Mikey cash.

749
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,683
Rym: I know when I go to a machine, I'm like, all right.

750
00:39:43,723 --> 00:39:44,827
Rym: And it gave me two options.

751
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:46,875
Rym: Top up my Mikey card.

752
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:50,727
Rym: I didn't have a Mikey card yet or buy a Mikey pass.

753
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:54,899
Rym: And it was obvious I didn't want the Mikey pass, but I hit.

754
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,927
Rym: top up, but I didn't have a Mikey card to put in.

755
00:39:57,208 --> 00:40:00,000
Rym: So we went to this hub in the main train station.

756
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:03,350
Rym: We were staying right across from a Southern cross.

757
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:07,103
Rym: I was thinking about a dimension century Southern cross.

758
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:13,764
Rym: I was thinking of that every time we walked past entered or exited that station or so 10, no Ken.

759
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:19,242
Rym: So we go into this PT hub, which is like the place where tourists and people can get help.

760
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,012
Rym: And one, there were other people in there.

761
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:28,923
Rym: Some of whom were native Melburnians, or at least Australians there for packs who themselves could not figure out the fucking Mikey card.

762
00:40:29,023 --> 00:40:30,449
Rym: Apparently it's relatively new.

763
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,674
Rym: Yeah.

764
00:40:31,714 --> 00:40:32,598
Scott: Here's how it works is?

765
00:40:32,658 --> 00:40:41,593
Scott: it's basically, it's a card you use to go anywhere, any kind of the transportation, the trams, the trains, the trains that go really far, the trains that don't go so far.

766
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,224
Scott: They all use the Mikey card, fucking everything uses it.

767
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:49,002
Scott: So because everything uses it, but not everything is the same price, right?

768
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,854
Scott: They have to actually sort of gauge it differently.

769
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:55,369
Scott: So from what I could tell is we never left zone one, zone one is the city.

770
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:59,706
Rym: It was possible to leave zone one because there's like three tram stops that are outside of.

771
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:02,836
Scott: zone two is commuting, right?

772
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:03,960
Scott: So we weren't going anywhere.

773
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,545
Scott: Commuters are from in the suburbs.

774
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:06,870
Scott: So we were in zone one.

775
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:15,397
Scott: So in zone one, we paid three 50 to the Australian dollars to, to go around for a two hour time limit.

776
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:16,722
Scott: We could do as much as we wanted.

777
00:41:16,762 --> 00:41:19,535
Scott: And then it would automatically sort of undo us after two hours.

778
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:23,749
Scott: And then we would pay three 50 for another two hours, but there was a limit of $7 a day.

779
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:32,495
Scott: So once we paid $7 a day, we could go around in zone one, unlimitedly on pretty much anything.

780
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:36,010
Rym: Now you can touch on, which is like swiping to get on a swipe.

781
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,882
Scott: You just sort of hold it near the thing and you can touch off when you get off.

782
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:46,024
Rym: But people we talked to kept giving us different advice on when you should and should not touch off.

783
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:46,928
Scott: I saw Australia.

784
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:48,194
Scott: It's it's an honor system.

785
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:49,218
Scott: It wasn't a turnstile.

786
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,730
Scott: So I saw people getting on and getting off without doing anything.

787
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:58,160
Scott: I saw people religiously tapping, touching on and off at every single, I saw most people touched on, but did not touch off.

788
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:06,897
Scott: I saw a lot of people doing that, but someone else told me, yeah, you should touch off because if you don't, then it assumes you went the farthest you could possibly go.

789
00:42:06,937 --> 00:42:10,272
Rym: I had another person tell me that you shouldn't always touch off.

790
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:13,869
Rym: And he tried to give me all these examples of times when touching off costs you more money.

791
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:14,552
Scott: Yeah.

792
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:20,280
Rym: And like, I went to refill my Mikey card at one point and it showed that I was still touched on somewhere, I guess.

793
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:23,650
Rym: I really never quite understood it.

794
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:33,447
Rym: And, uh, by the end of the trip, because I'd been using it sub optimally, I ran out my money and I kinda just kept riding for the rest of the day without paying money without paying more money.

795
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,074
Scott: I think I had like $3 left.

796
00:42:35,214 --> 00:42:37,784
Rym: I didn't balance of negative $3 on mine.

797
00:42:37,944 --> 00:42:39,108
Scott: I didn't know you can get to negative.

798
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:46,996
Rym: It appears that once you go over the first time, it says, instead of like touched on, it says like top up your Mikey card.

799
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:48,762
Rym: So I guess they give you a credit.

800
00:42:50,347 --> 00:42:55,344
Scott: So then if you try to fill that card, you would have to put in the money and even more money.

801
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:55,605
Scott: Yep.

802
00:42:55,726 --> 00:42:57,493
Rym: And it costs money for the Mikey cards.

803
00:42:57,774 --> 00:42:58,738
Scott: Cards are anonymous.

804
00:42:58,758 --> 00:43:02,734
Rym: So why not just throw the card out because it costs $6 to get a new card.

805
00:43:02,835 --> 00:43:03,959
Scott: So just go for credit.

806
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,682
Scott: Oh, blower than $6.

807
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:11,304
Rym: I think the maximum credit you could get is like $3 and change because you touched on once.

808
00:43:11,324 --> 00:43:13,853
Scott: So you're better off refilling it than buying a new one.

809
00:43:14,034 --> 00:43:14,777
Scott: Yeah.

810
00:43:14,998 --> 00:43:15,620
Rym: Clever girl.

811
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:18,393
Scott: So yeah, we steal someone else's card from the ground.

812
00:43:18,573 --> 00:43:29,196
Scott: Point is we couldn't figure it out and neither could most of the Australians we talked to, but they did tell us that apparently even the Mikey system as messed up as it was, was still better than other cities.

813
00:43:29,216 --> 00:43:36,267
Scott: Like they told me that in Sydney, you have to buy a paper ticket for everything to go from point a to point B con like everything is Metro North or whatever.

814
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:37,231
Scott: And that's not good.

815
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:38,717
Rym: Istanbul is plastic tokens.

816
00:43:39,078 --> 00:43:39,460
Scott: That's cool.

817
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:39,922
Scott: Yeah.

818
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:40,727
Scott: I like that.

819
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:41,854
Rym: That's because you buy tokens.

820
00:43:41,894 --> 00:43:42,478
Rym: They were super cheap.

821
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:45,732
Scott: It's like, that's like the old New York city tolls used to have tone.

822
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:46,797
Rym: I kept a couple of them.

823
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:50,212
Rym: It basically costs like a quarter to ride the subway in Istanbul.

824
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:53,469
Scott: The thing with the toll tokens is like, if you had a token, it'd be like easy pass.

825
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,164
Scott: You drive up, you throw one token and you drive, you keep going forward.

826
00:43:56,185 --> 00:43:57,050
Scott: You don't have to make change.

827
00:43:57,412 --> 00:44:05,570
Scott: But if you needed to buy tokens, you basically stop at the toll hand, the guy at 20, he would give you like a fistful of tokens in a role, and then you would drive away.

828
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,839
Scott: And that would be cause long lines of the tolls.

829
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,945
Scott: Easy passes way better.

830
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:11,175
Scott: They had an easy pass kind of system there.

831
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,043
Scott: It was just called something else like E tag.

832
00:44:13,305 --> 00:44:13,646
Scott: It worked.

833
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:17,767
Scott: I think it made a little noise whenever it charged you money and they didn't actually have like booths.

834
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:19,800
Scott: It just sort of charged you money as you went down the highway.

835
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:23,115
Rym: So the trams worked fine as like local mass transit.

836
00:44:23,135 --> 00:44:25,283
Rym: We used them the whole time and they were pretty much great.

837
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:27,309
Rym: It was nice being in a modern city.

838
00:44:28,012 --> 00:44:30,018
Rym: I skip around a bit food.

839
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:44,753
Rym: It was interesting that food, so Asian food, there is a Chinatown in Melbourne, which was about one third Japanese, one third Chinese, one third Korean, but then interspersed around all of those zones was pretty much every other Asian nation.

840
00:44:45,034 --> 00:44:45,255
Scott: Yeah.

841
00:44:45,356 --> 00:44:49,417
Scott: I mean, there's a lot of Asian stuff there cause it's really close to Asia and there's a lot of Asian people there.

842
00:44:49,477 --> 00:44:49,658
Rym: Yep.

843
00:44:49,939 --> 00:45:01,925
Scott: And we noticed that there were teppanyaki and hibachi restaurants and they were actually called teppanyaki and hibachi appropriately as opposed to the U S where everything is called hibachi, even if it is teppanyaki.

844
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:02,186
Rym: Yup.

845
00:45:02,507 --> 00:45:13,127
Rym: So we decided one night that we haven't had teppanyaki in a long as we Googled for the best teppanyaki in the city of Melbourne and we went to it and it was really expensive.

846
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:14,814
Scott: It was really good and really good.

847
00:45:14,935 --> 00:45:26,547
Scott: And what I thought, but it wasn't as expensive as it appeared because remember the, between the built-in tax and the no tipping in restaurants, cause they're getting paid well, but it raises the, obviously that causes the prices of menu items to be raised.

848
00:45:26,948 --> 00:45:35,436
Scott: Like it says $70 on a menu for like some of the things, but really that's the equivalent of like a 45 $50 meal in the U S right.

849
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:36,259
Scott: So expensive.

850
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:40,479
Scott: Yes, but not as crazy expensive, like a $70 meal in the U S. I would've been like, hell no.

851
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:43,716
Rym: So we had a pack shirt on and the girl who's seated is like, Oh, you went to packs.

852
00:45:43,897 --> 00:45:44,359
Rym: Oh my God.

853
00:45:44,399 --> 00:45:45,663
Rym: I was there to packs is the best.

854
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:51,861
Rym: And that, that played out many times throughout our trip around the city.

855
00:45:51,921 --> 00:45:55,376
Rym: People went to packs and new packs and we're totally chill.

856
00:45:55,396 --> 00:45:59,934
Rym: And we kept meeting packs, people all around the city and like gaming shops and on the street.

857
00:46:00,315 --> 00:46:04,657
Rym: And even someone we met at the con and hung out with, we tweeted like, Hey, we're going to go eat here.

858
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:05,462
Rym: He just showed up.

859
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,024
Scott: Yeah.

860
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:06,486
Scott: Cool guy.

861
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:07,049
Scott: Hang out with us.

862
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,335
Scott: I think it's Paul, right?

863
00:46:08,395 --> 00:46:08,656
Scott: I think.

864
00:46:08,677 --> 00:46:08,938
Scott: Yeah.

865
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:09,360
Rym: Cool guy.

866
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:09,962
Scott: Cool guy.

867
00:46:10,263 --> 00:46:11,207
Rym: And uh, yeah.

868
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:14,340
Rym: The other thing I noticed kind of generally, he's not good at hive though.

869
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,626
Scott: He's got to improve his hive skills.

870
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:24,639
Rym: All the Australians we talked to, even people who didn't have great jobs had a lot more disposable income than the average American.

871
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:26,748
Scott: Well, things are more expensive, so I hope they did.

872
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:27,210
Scott: Yeah.

873
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:40,432
Rym: But in terms of their purchasing power, like people who, if the equivalent socioeconomic class in the U S at a con would go eat McDonald's because they could literally cannot afford to eat out fancy every night.

874
00:46:41,195 --> 00:46:49,282
Rym: Those equivalent people with equivalent jobs in Australia appeared to be able to eat out at nice restaurants in a downtown fancy city.

875
00:46:50,326 --> 00:46:53,636
Scott: So, you know, we didn't really go to areas where poor people live.

876
00:46:54,197 --> 00:47:04,292
Rym: Oh, I did run in and I just kind of kept an eye out and the restaurants everywhere were nicer than the equivalent restaurant would be in the U S nice.

877
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:04,773
Scott: Okay.

878
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,078
Rym: That was my experience.

879
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:11,742
Rym: I have a ton of pictures from a lot of the kind of like normal residential, like the equivalent of far out Queens places.

880
00:47:12,524 --> 00:47:17,317
Scott: Something else that really surprised me in Australia was how big the queen is.

881
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:19,164
Scott: She is kind of a big deal.

882
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:22,842
Rym: We're walking around the botanical garden on Thursday and Scott keeps seeing this building.

883
00:47:22,902 --> 00:47:29,252
Scott: Well, we saw, okay, so in the distance we see this castle basically tower with a flag and I'm like, whatever that is, it looks touristy.

884
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:31,161
Scott: It looks the kind of place that Australians won't go.

885
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:32,386
Scott: It also looks like a castle.

886
00:47:32,988 --> 00:47:35,599
Scott: I definitely want to check that the fuck out cause castle.

887
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:37,025
Rym: So we kind of keep it as a vague.

888
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:42,388
Scott: I know that whatever's there isn't very old cause it's Australia, but I know that it looks like a cast.

889
00:47:42,428 --> 00:47:47,993
Rym: So we basically wander all these gardens with the idea that let's slowly try to edge your way toward this thing.

890
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:50,143
Scott: There's a lot of stuff between us and that that looks cool.

891
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:58,734
Scott: We saw giant amphitheater that was pretty sweet and awesome pictures of birds and flowers and all kinds of cool stuff in the park.

892
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:01,383
Rym: People hanging out actually get closer to this thing.

893
00:48:01,764 --> 00:48:06,180
Scott: There's a fence in the way and it's like, huh, why, why is this closed?

894
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,969
Scott: That looks like a thing we should be able to get into.

895
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:09,659
Scott: The entrance must be on the other side.

896
00:48:10,441 --> 00:48:13,493
Scott: So I see an Australian guy walking around in the park.

897
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:17,047
Scott: It was pretty quiet cause it was a Thursday weekday during the day in a giant park.

898
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:20,180
Scott: And I'm like, Hey, uh, do you know if I can get in there?

899
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:20,803
Scott: How I can get in here?

900
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:23,298
Scott: He's like, Oh no, the governor, that's the governor's house.

901
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:24,082
Scott: You can't get in there.

902
00:48:24,524 --> 00:48:25,387
Scott: Maybe twice a year.

903
00:48:25,427 --> 00:48:27,878
Scott: They open it for like one day for people to go.

904
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:31,051
Rym: I believe at this point you were thinking what elected governor.

905
00:48:31,172 --> 00:48:39,208
Scott: I was thinking the governor of Victoria, the person who was elected by the people to be the governor of Victoria, sort of like Gracie mansion, the mayor lives in, in New York.

906
00:48:39,248 --> 00:48:42,200
Rym: Then we realized this is governor in the Sid Myers pirates.

907
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:50,408
Scott: Governor governor, as in like, please, sir, may I have a letter of Mark and go privateering to bring back riches for you governor.

908
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:55,508
Scott: And I was like, now I really fucking want to go in there and you can't, can't go in there.

909
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:57,134
Scott: I'm going to go in there.

910
00:48:57,154 --> 00:49:00,446
Scott: I don't care what kind of international incident is going to happen.

911
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:06,133
Scott: Well, later, later we went into the, I'm going to figure out like the day it's open and that's when I'm going to go to Australia.

912
00:49:06,354 --> 00:49:10,176
Rym: So we went to the tallest building in Melbourne, you know, God, we got to do the touristy stuff and see those things.

913
00:49:10,236 --> 00:49:15,115
Rym: because you like in New York city, you say, Oh, the Eureka tower is touristy.

914
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:16,179
Rym: Yeah, it's touristy.

915
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:16,541
Rym: You know what?

916
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:18,067
Rym: It's also a fucking amazing view.

917
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,587
Rym: All the big tall buildings in New York have great views of the city and it is kind of worth it.

918
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:25,100
Rym: So we went and we got a great view of the whole city.

919
00:49:25,681 --> 00:49:28,351
Rym: They had this thing called the edge, the edge.

920
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:33,949
Rym: You could pay extra money to stand in a glass cube that moved like 10 feet out and back in.

921
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,798
Scott: It was really, really late.

922
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:38,044
Scott: They didn't let you take cameras in there.

923
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:38,628
Scott: We didn't do it.

924
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:38,970
Scott: Obviously.

925
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:39,876
Scott: It was really stupid.

926
00:49:39,896 --> 00:49:43,413
Rym: Like we're out there, like on this balcony, hanging out with Aaron C and a bunch of enforcers.

927
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:46,851
Rym: And then we look and we see the edge just kind of popped out next to us.

928
00:49:46,872 --> 00:49:48,922
Rym: A bunch of kind of bored looking people were standing in there.

929
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:49,524
Scott: Yep.

930
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,049
Scott: They paid 12 bucks for that.

931
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:51,350
Rym: Yeah.

932
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:51,672
Rym: Each.

933
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:52,334
Scott: Yeah.

934
00:49:52,675 --> 00:49:52,896
Scott: Wow.

935
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:57,658
Rym: And we could see the governor's house and I think we could have hang glided their base jumped there.

936
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:58,542
Scott: Something like that.

937
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:10,819
Scott: Apparently the previous tallest building in Melbourne, they told us a story that the someone put a restaurant at the top and then some people went to that restaurant, got drinks at the bar and then base jumped off the balcony, which is awesome.

938
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,766
Rym: Oh, here's the story for daredevils.

939
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:15,980
Rym: Do a base jump from Rialto towers after cocktails.

940
00:50:17,562 --> 00:50:27,760
Rym: I knew of this story because it's one of those things that was on FARC and you just knew about it a long time ago, but like it was in a collection of like crazy cool things people have done.

941
00:50:28,661 --> 00:50:30,469
Rym: And I didn't realize it was in Melbourne.

942
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:31,012
Rym: Yeah.

943
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,302
Rym: And that it was right there that it happened.

944
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:36,840
Rym: And I did not realize the full extent of what these awesome dudes did.

945
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,566
Scott: Awesome people, heroes.

946
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:39,911
Rym: This is the awesomest thing.

947
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:42,522
Rym: I encourage more people to do things like this.

948
00:50:42,843 --> 00:50:43,787
Scott: I do as well.

949
00:50:43,928 --> 00:50:48,406
Scott: Even if it gets you arrested, which it probably will in the U S it would probably get you really arrested.

950
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:55,346
Rym: If you get arrested after successfully base jumping, that is a badge of honor.

951
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:55,728
Rym: Yeah.

952
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:57,153
Scott: That's like an achievement.

953
00:50:57,514 --> 00:50:59,864
Scott: Got arrested, did a base jump that got you arrested.

954
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:01,070
Rym: I would put that on my resume.

955
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:02,216
Rym: It's like, yeah, it was arrested.

956
00:51:02,497 --> 00:51:02,758
Rym: Yeah.

957
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:04,787
Rym: Base jumping off the empire state building.

958
00:51:04,988 --> 00:51:06,875
Scott: I would also put that on my resume.

959
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:08,181
Rym: That's the kind of thing.

960
00:51:08,201 --> 00:51:11,417
Rym: It's one of those situations where the judge should, yes, it was illegal.

961
00:51:11,518 --> 00:51:12,463
Rym: Here's your punishment.

962
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:15,317
Rym: I'm also going to high five you before they put the handcuffs on.

963
00:51:15,337 --> 00:51:15,920
Scott: That's right.

964
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:18,504
Scott: Uh, trying to think.

965
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:20,370
Rym: So, uh, we'll jump around.

966
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:22,799
Rym: We went to an Aussie rules football guy.

967
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:23,622
Rym: I almost want to do it.

968
00:51:23,643 --> 00:51:24,547
Scott: That was on Friday.

969
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,260
Rym: I feel like we should do a Tuesday show on Aussie rules football.

970
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:27,541
Scott: Yeah.

971
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:35,232
Scott: Let's just say that it was sort of a combination of professional sports and college sports in the way the fans reacted, the way the game is played.

972
00:51:35,252 --> 00:51:39,411
Scott: I like certain aspects of the game and I also dislike certain aspects of the game.

973
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:42,684
Rym: I enjoyed it a thousand times more than any soccer game I've ever seen.

974
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,194
Scott: That's your, I would be a fan of this sport.

975
00:51:46,635 --> 00:51:52,310
Scott: Were it on, uh, you know, TV in the U S in Jersey, because I love, did you actually buy one?

976
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:56,481
Rym: They're hard as bucks.

977
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:56,964
Rym: So I got it.

978
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:57,527
Scott: That was a lot.

979
00:51:57,587 --> 00:51:59,416
Scott: I didn't buy one because it's too much money, dude.

980
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:01,104
Rym: I spent like Essendon.

981
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,249
Scott: I was for that.

982
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:03,314
Scott: They got their asses kicked.

983
00:52:03,334 --> 00:52:06,568
Rym: It's got, I spent like a hundred and I spent like $200 in my red wings.

984
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:06,889
Rym: Jersey.

985
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:14,159
Scott: So seven bucks for I was, I was for them simply for the fact that a, they seem to be the home team and B their logo is way awesome.

986
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:15,586
Scott: It's just like a fucking stealth bomber.

987
00:52:15,626 --> 00:52:16,249
Scott: It's like, Oh fuck.

988
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,540
Rym: I will say this about AFL and about footy fans.

989
00:52:18,741 --> 00:52:19,686
Rym: The game is called footy.

990
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:22,379
Rym: I used to kind of think when people said footy, they meant soccer.

991
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:24,747
Rym: No footy is AFL specifically.

992
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:25,229
Scott: Yeah.

993
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:28,500
Scott: It's way easier to say footy than say to AFL or Aussie football.

994
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:32,256
Rym: We went to pretty much the craziest game that like would happen ever.

995
00:52:32,297 --> 00:52:32,457
Rym: Yeah.

996
00:52:32,498 --> 00:52:38,041
Scott: Basically there were three, we knew we wanted to go to a game and there were three games happening during the time we were there.

997
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:42,342
Scott: And we asked around and people said, well, look, those two games, one of them's at one stadium.

998
00:52:42,402 --> 00:52:44,029
Scott: One's at the other, but those are the shit games.

999
00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:47,284
Scott: That's like Mets versus crappy other crappy team, right?

1000
00:52:47,304 --> 00:52:48,891
Scott: You don't want to see those games like all right.

1001
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:49,835
Rym: Lions Brown.

1002
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:50,438
Rym: Yeah.

1003
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:57,426
Scott: One of the games was at the Melbourne cricket grounds, which is this huge hundred thousand seat stadium, but that was one of the crappy ones.

1004
00:52:57,847 --> 00:52:59,754
Scott: There was also a soccer game.

1005
00:52:59,835 --> 00:53:07,276
Scott: Liverpool was in town to play Melbourne in soccer, every hotel in the entire goddamn city.

1006
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:13,360
Scott: So we left town that day because once he found out about that was happening, the concierge was like, yo dog.

1007
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,002
Rym: Yeah.

1008
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:15,430
Rym: There's going to be no hotels in the cities.

1009
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:15,751
Scott: Yeah.

1010
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:16,174
Scott: Get out.

1011
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,346
Scott: So that was also the Melbourne cricket grounds.

1012
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:23,911
Scott: So I kind of wanted to go to the Melbourne cricket grounds because that was the superior arena, the superior field stadium.

1013
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:31,742
Scott: But we ended up going to Eddie hot stadium where the superior game was happening, which is Hawks Essendon, which are the two top teams.

1014
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:39,619
Scott: So that's like fricking seeing, you know, the super bowl, but it wasn't, it was a regular, it was a regular season game between the number one team and the number two team.

1015
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:41,086
Scott: So we went to that one.

1016
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:41,649
Rym: It was great.

1017
00:53:41,729 --> 00:53:45,328
Rym: I want to make the one cultural thing, even though it was a blowout, the cultural observation.

1018
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:45,509
Rym: Yeah.

1019
00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:47,158
Rym: We rooted for the wrong goddamn team.

1020
00:53:47,198 --> 00:53:49,851
Rym: That's for the cultural observations I want to make about it.

1021
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:55,475
Rym: in this show, as opposed to the separate show we'll do on footy one, you can bet on fucking everything.

1022
00:53:55,535 --> 00:53:56,840
Rym: Gambling is just totally legal.

1023
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,829
Scott: Gambling was legal everywhere in Melbourne.

1024
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,298
Rym: So Scott and I were at the game.

1025
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:02,993
Rym: I was like, Hey, I'm going to go see if I can place a bet on the game.

1026
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:03,918
Rym: And I go to the kiosk.

1027
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,749
Rym: You can bet on everything.

1028
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:15,357
Rym: It was like first team to 20 points, first team to 30 points, first team to this spread point spread in either direction, number of behinds.

1029
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:17,544
Rym: Like you could bet on anything.

1030
00:54:17,624 --> 00:54:18,728
Rym: It was crazy.

1031
00:54:18,748 --> 00:54:20,534
Scott: I would not bet on that.

1032
00:54:20,554 --> 00:54:21,276
Scott: and horse racing.

1033
00:54:21,316 --> 00:54:23,564
Scott: I saw horse racing everywhere with betting everywhere.

1034
00:54:23,985 --> 00:54:26,955
Scott: It's like we used to have OTV and it's gone.

1035
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:29,102
Scott: Now they have, what was it called?

1036
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:30,968
Scott: It was like you, Oh, Tats.

1037
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,983
Scott: No, Tats was the lottery, the private lottery, private lottery.

1038
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:40,043
Scott: I think it was UBT or something that was like the, the way to bet on sports from pretty much anywhere.

1039
00:54:40,064 --> 00:54:42,697
Scott: And it was like, Whoa, there is betting all over the place.

1040
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:48,081
Rym: They rolled up a truck that just had a horse racing betting outside the stadium for Eddie out of stadium for the footy.

1041
00:54:48,242 --> 00:54:48,583
Scott: Yeah.

1042
00:54:48,864 --> 00:55:04,745
Rym: So the other thing I want to point out is that at first, if I had stayed for the first quarter of this game and then left, I would have told you that fans of footy are surprisingly genteel because they are the, a lot of the people were old ladies route that they've been rooting for this team their entire lives.

1043
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:05,387
Scott: Yup.

1044
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:08,758
Rym: And it was a very interesting anti hooliganism culture.

1045
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:19,242
Rym: Like footy fans seem to take pride in the fact that there's very little hooliganism and they really look down on it and they really pride themselves in not being soccer fans with all their bullshit too.

1046
00:55:20,365 --> 00:55:24,036
Rym: The, uh, the people were shouting things like, come on bombers.

1047
00:55:24,498 --> 00:55:24,718
Rym: Yeah.

1048
00:55:24,758 --> 00:55:25,842
Rym: Like these very sort of like.

1049
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,066
Rym: the ref is a joke.

1050
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:28,691
Rym: That was a joke call ref.

1051
00:55:29,354 --> 00:55:32,404
Rym: Like it felt just very quaint and very pleasant to genteel.

1052
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:33,327
Rym: Yeah.

1053
00:55:33,467 --> 00:55:47,346
Rym: After the second half, a man next to us put his hands up to his mouth and yelled immortal words, shit down his throat, shit in his fucking mouth, shit in his fucking mouth and then rip off his head.

1054
00:55:47,366 --> 00:55:53,486
Rym: And it was so beautiful because that was the same man who had been saying the ref is a joke.

1055
00:55:53,908 --> 00:55:55,274
Rym: Not 10 minutes prior.

1056
00:55:55,495 --> 00:55:58,286
Scott: He was one, that was the yelling guy pretty much that was standing behind us.

1057
00:55:58,346 --> 00:56:00,515
Rym: But he was the w. so we showed up, right?

1058
00:56:00,977 --> 00:56:02,163
Rym: And the game like where is?

1059
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:08,970
Rym: hours before the game, we were some of the first people and there's a guy sitting in the seat and he yells footy.

1060
00:56:09,371 --> 00:56:18,477
Rym: I was never more proud of a man that I've met who was a stranger than at that moment because all my mind, I was like, did he just say hockey?

1061
00:56:18,557 --> 00:56:20,182
Scott: That's what they say.

1062
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:21,227
Rym: I almost yelled.

1063
00:56:21,267 --> 00:56:22,451
Rym: That's what this is.

1064
00:56:22,532 --> 00:56:25,966
Rym: But I didn't want to engage because I was in a foreign land and a foreign sport.

1065
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,034
Rym: I didn't know all the protocols yet.

1066
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:31,206
Rym: I wondered if someone else was going to yell a call back to him.

1067
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,877
Rym: But yeah, we'll talk more about footy in another show.

1068
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:40,220
Scott: So the big thing we did while we were there is we went to the penguin Island, also known as Phillip Island.

1069
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,483
Rym: So Phillip Island to give you a very brief history, penguins everywhere and seals and awesome nature.

1070
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:49,435
Rym: Australians ruined it by moving onto it and building houses.

1071
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:54,254
Scott: They all moved there and built crazy vacation places like holy crap, vacation land.

1072
00:56:54,836 --> 00:56:57,025
Rym: So the Australian government was like, look, you fuckers.

1073
00:56:57,266 --> 00:56:59,254
Rym: So they picked, they took a big chunk of the Island.

1074
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:02,127
Rym: They eminent domain, everybody off of that chunk.

1075
00:57:02,409 --> 00:57:04,640
Rym: And now they're reintroducing the penguin populations.

1076
00:57:06,682 --> 00:57:09,854
Scott: Most of the Island seems to be nature or touristy.

1077
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:11,740
Scott: And there is a town called cows, C?

1078
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,976
Scott: O W E S where people live and there's hotels and restaurants and houses.

1079
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:19,167
Scott: And it's sort of vacation beach town, right?

1080
00:57:19,347 --> 00:57:23,881
Scott: But a large chunk of the Island is just like, yeah, this is penguin land.

1081
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:28,885
Scott: And then there's other chunks where it's like this, please buy this land and build a housing development and move to it.

1082
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:36,582
Rym: But what's interesting is that a lot like we went to the penguin thing, you know, the, the parade of penguins, you can look up what the parade of penguins is.

1083
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:38,630
Rym: It is exactly what it sounds like.

1084
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:49,590
Rym: And Scott and I, we figured, you know, everyone on the internet, even people who are cynical jaded travelers, like we are said the penguin thing, it's touristy, but you must see the penguin thing.

1085
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,159
Rym: So we paid for the ultimate penguin experience.

1086
00:57:52,640 --> 00:58:00,651
Scott: So the regular penguin experience, you sit in these bleachers on the beach, the sun goes down, the moon comes up, they turn on lights so you can see.

1087
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:04,965
Scott: And these penguins come out of the water and go to their houses at night.

1088
00:58:05,045 --> 00:58:05,988
Rym: It is adorable.

1089
00:58:06,008 --> 00:58:14,500
Rym: The ultimate penguin experience is you go privately with like there was me, Scott and three other people and the ranger and a park ranger, right?

1090
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,543
Scott: Took us into a private, take you to a different beach while the private room first to tell you what's going on.

1091
00:58:19,603 --> 00:58:23,160
Rym: And then you give, they give you night vision and shrouds and things to sit on.

1092
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:29,385
Scott: And they take you to a private beach where you watch different penguins come on and go to their homes in the dark.

1093
00:58:29,566 --> 00:58:31,194
Rym: I mean, it's, it's a long experience.

1094
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,591
Scott: Usually like she explained, you sit there for like an hour in the sand and you learn it.

1095
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:35,918
Rym: She really knew her stuff.

1096
00:58:35,938 --> 00:58:39,255
Rym: She told us everything about the penguins and what's her job is to know about penguins.

1097
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:49,878
Rym: And then this tiny group, we walk out into the beach that we'd been hiking on during the day, but now it was closed and we just huddle up on the beach in our black with our night vision and we wait with radios.

1098
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:52,370
Rym: And then the baby penguins, well, they're not baby.

1099
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:53,013
Rym: They're just tiny.

1100
00:58:53,174 --> 00:58:55,164
Scott: They're called, they're called the little penguin.

1101
00:58:55,185 --> 00:58:55,667
Scott: They're like a foot.

1102
00:58:55,687 --> 00:59:01,780
Scott: They're also known as the fairy penguin, but the official name, I guess, is the little penguin and the little penguins just form rafts in the ocean.

1103
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,953
Rym: Apparently they didn't have babies on the land in penguin town.

1104
00:59:05,013 --> 00:59:07,786
Scott: It wasn't the time yet in this time of year because it was winter.

1105
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:09,173
Rym: So they don't have to come in.

1106
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:09,515
Scott: Yeah.

1107
00:59:09,555 --> 00:59:16,843
Scott: Basically the penguins live in the water and they also have houses on land, but they can stay in the water for fucking ever if they want to.

1108
00:59:16,864 --> 00:59:17,869
Scott: They don't have to come back home.

1109
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:19,438
Rym: They come home to socialize.

1110
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:19,599
Scott: Yeah.

1111
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,410
Scott: Basically, it's like going to work and go into the city.

1112
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,920
Scott: It's like they can stay at work for a long time and they can stay at home for a long time and they sleep during, they seem to be nocturnal.

1113
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:26,462
Scott: Really?

1114
00:59:26,684 --> 00:59:29,099
Rym: Now they're pretty safe in penguin town and we keep saying penguin town.

1115
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,407
Rym: No, there was a penguin.

1116
00:59:30,427 --> 00:59:32,499
Scott: That was basically fucking penguin New York right there.

1117
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,150
Rym: The penguins all make their own little houses.

1118
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:40,134
Scott: It's like we're in this place during the day and you don't see or hear any penguins, but they stay signs everywhere.

1119
00:59:40,174 --> 00:59:40,757
Scott: Like watch out.

1120
00:59:40,817 --> 00:59:42,566
Scott: Penguins live here in holes in the ground.

1121
00:59:42,807 --> 00:59:43,892
Scott: Don't step on this shit.

1122
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:47,750
Scott: And then at night they basically all come out and go, they're so loud.

1123
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:49,498
Rym: They're just like walking around talking to each other.

1124
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:53,199
Rym: Like one penguin goes to someone else's house and that guy's like, get the fuck away from my house.

1125
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,379
Rym: The females are like, find a mate and hang out or go to their mate's house or whatever.

1126
00:59:57,459 --> 01:00:05,171
Rym: And they socialize and they're super loud and just walking around all night and interspersed among them are just rabbits everywhere and wallabies everywhere.

1127
01:00:05,252 --> 01:00:07,380
Rym: Just hanging out animal gooses.

1128
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,827
Rym: They are so loud.

1129
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:11,173
Scott: They're loud at night when they work.

1130
01:00:11,213 --> 01:00:14,809
Rym: They're not loud on the beach because the beach is where predators might get them.

1131
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:15,171
Scott: Right.

1132
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:17,985
Scott: See when they're hanging out in the grass area, they can just go into their house.

1133
01:00:18,226 --> 01:00:22,949
Rym: Imagine if you work in New York city and you commute back to beacon, you know, upstate New York on the train.

1134
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:24,818
Rym: So in New York, New York's awesome.

1135
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:27,870
Rym: You can just stay in New York forever, but occasionally you got to go home.

1136
01:00:28,271 --> 01:00:32,670
Rym: So every day you kind of meet with all the other workers like near a subway train.

1137
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,836
Rym: You're like, should we go home?

1138
01:00:33,957 --> 01:00:34,319
Rym: I don't know.

1139
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:35,423
Rym: Well, that's all.

1140
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:35,624
Rym: Yeah.

1141
01:00:35,705 --> 01:00:36,046
Rym: Okay.

1142
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:36,791
Rym: Let's get on the train.

1143
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,244
Rym: So we all get on the train and then the train gets to beacon roll.

1144
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:40,329
Rym: Like you want to get out.

1145
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:42,399
Rym: And then there's wolves at the train station.

1146
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:43,665
Rym: We're not this time.

1147
01:00:44,147 --> 01:00:45,011
Rym: Takes the train back to New York.

1148
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:46,900
Scott: They basically, they group up so that they're safe.

1149
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,036
Rym: They cross the beach in a group up and decide if they're even going to come in.

1150
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:51,558
Scott: Yeah.

1151
01:00:51,779 --> 01:00:53,548
Scott: So they'll see them like the come out of the water.

1152
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:57,005
Scott: The first they'll be in the water and they'll form a group in the water where it's safe.

1153
01:00:57,427 --> 01:01:01,869
Scott: Then they come out onto the beach where they basically have no camo and they have to run across the beach really fast.

1154
01:01:02,171 --> 01:01:07,213
Scott: So they'll be in a group on the edge of the water and they'd be like, is there any wolves or foxes on this beach?

1155
01:01:07,815 --> 01:01:08,940
Scott: And they'd be like, oh shit danger.

1156
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,004
Scott: And they'll run back in the water and then they'll come back on the beach and be like, I think we can go for it guys.

1157
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:13,527
Scott: Let's go for it.

1158
01:01:13,568 --> 01:01:14,030
Scott: All right, let's go.

1159
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:14,553
Scott: Let's go.

1160
01:01:14,614 --> 01:01:16,665
Scott: And they go and they run across the beach really fast.

1161
01:01:16,725 --> 01:01:19,759
Rym: So fast and so quiet, but they're also kind of derpy.

1162
01:01:19,779 --> 01:01:20,843
Rym: They keep tripping over stuff.

1163
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:21,265
Scott: Yeah.

1164
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:22,591
Scott: But they climb big.

1165
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:27,617
Scott: It's like you think these little floppy fins, like they're meant for swimming, not for walking, but they climb right up that hill.

1166
01:01:27,637 --> 01:01:27,958
Scott: Like whoop.

1167
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,999
Rym: What was funny is that there's always a whole bunch of penguins and then that penguin.

1168
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:32,160
Scott: Yeah.

1169
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:32,844
Scott: The brave guy.

1170
01:01:32,864 --> 01:01:35,800
Rym: Well, there's the, there's the brave guy who goes first, all the normal guys.

1171
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:39,280
Rym: And then I can only assume that it's the, that guy of penguins that no one wants to talk to.

1172
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:40,848
Rym: He's always last by himself.

1173
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,938
Rym: And I think everyone just hoping the Fox will get him.

1174
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:43,300
Scott: Yep.

1175
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:47,599
Scott: We saw signs everywhere that like, Hey, we're trying to get the Foxes off the Island.

1176
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:48,664
Scott: If you see one, call us.

1177
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,288
Scott: We never saw one.

1178
01:01:49,328 --> 01:01:56,396
Rym: The ranger said that they have through a combination of poisoning and trapping gotten rid of all but 11 Foxes on this entire Island.

1179
01:01:56,878 --> 01:02:01,596
Rym: And the ranger was like, yeah, those last 11 Foxes are the good God, bad-ass Foxes.

1180
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:10,951
Rym: We can't get them to the smartest of the Fox rabbit in the lion's den because apparently you know, penguin city, there really weren't predators like Fox in the human's den.

1181
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:12,237
Scott: That's a bad-ass Fox.

1182
01:02:12,257 --> 01:02:16,051
Rym: So if a Fox goes to penguin town, he'll kill like 400 penguins.

1183
01:02:16,473 --> 01:02:16,974
Scott: Of course.

1184
01:02:16,995 --> 01:02:19,424
Rym: So yeah, they're trying to get rid of all the Foxes.

1185
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:21,493
Rym: Apparently what's sad is I'll be.

1186
01:02:21,593 --> 01:02:30,924
Rym: another big problem for the penguins is feral cats and humans who have cats that they let wander around, but due to public sentiment, they don't poison the cats.

1187
01:02:31,145 --> 01:02:35,464
Rym: They trap them and release them on other places and they still let people own cat.

1188
01:02:35,504 --> 01:02:37,595
Rym: So the cats are pretty much always going to be a problem.

1189
01:02:38,038 --> 01:02:40,370
Rym: I say if you're going to poison the Foxes, you poison the cats too.

1190
01:02:40,652 --> 01:02:40,812
Scott: Yeah.

1191
01:02:40,832 --> 01:02:41,134
Scott: Why not?

1192
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:42,180
Rym: Because they're, they're.

1193
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,317
Rym: similarly, uh, there's similar threat levels to those amazingly adorable.

1194
01:02:46,337 --> 01:02:47,402
Scott: We don't have a cat shortage.

1195
01:02:47,562 --> 01:02:48,426
Scott: We have a penguin shortage.

1196
01:02:48,506 --> 01:02:48,767
Scott: Yeah.

1197
01:02:49,108 --> 01:02:49,309
Scott: Yeah.

1198
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:54,291
Rym: But yeah, having the night vision was kind of cool because the penguins couldn't see at first.

1199
01:02:54,372 --> 01:02:55,839
Scott: I'm like, Oh, they gave us the night vision.

1200
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,005
Scott: I just want to see the penguins.

1201
01:02:57,045 --> 01:02:57,768
Scott: I'm not going to use it.

1202
01:02:57,909 --> 01:02:59,055
Scott: I can see them without it.

1203
01:02:59,376 --> 01:02:59,879
Scott: No, you can't.

1204
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:01,004
Rym: It is so dark.

1205
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:02,953
Rym: It is dark until you see all this other stuff.

1206
01:03:02,973 --> 01:03:05,566
Scott: And it was nice to have some darkness after living in New York city.

1207
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:11,891
Scott: That was the first time in a while I've seen like fucking stars and shit, but the wallabies could see the IR splash.

1208
01:03:12,212 --> 01:03:17,131
Rym: So I'd be like scanning and I'd see a wallaby and the wallaby would see me looking at him like, what the fuck dude?

1209
01:03:17,653 --> 01:03:18,617
Rym: What the fuck?

1210
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:21,128
Rym: Cause he could see it like a flashlight aimed at him.

1211
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:22,877
Rym: But the penguins couldn't see that.

1212
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:23,961
Rym: The rabbits couldn't see that.

1213
01:03:23,982 --> 01:03:24,483
Rym: Yeah.

1214
01:03:25,467 --> 01:03:25,688
Scott: All right.

1215
01:03:25,788 --> 01:03:27,032
Scott: Other things on that Island.

1216
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,622
Scott: Uh, another surreal experience at a restaurant.

1217
01:03:29,964 --> 01:03:30,566
Rym: Oh my God.

1218
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:38,682
Rym: So we went to this great restaurant that has this great dog and got some great food, but it was like this beer place, but we run by a guy who was clearly a beer nerd of Australia.

1219
01:03:38,702 --> 01:03:39,848
Rym: That guy is such a beer nerd.

1220
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:42,764
Rym: It was one of the only places in Australia that you had his horsey beer, right?

1221
01:03:42,925 --> 01:03:43,005
Rym: Yeah.

1222
01:03:43,025 --> 01:03:43,587
Rym: I did have a source.

1223
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:45,154
Scott: It was really good.

1224
01:03:45,877 --> 01:03:47,764
Rym: Most of the beer I had in Australia was mediocre.

1225
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:48,005
Rym: Yeah.

1226
01:03:48,065 --> 01:03:49,190
Rym: No fosters in Australia.

1227
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:50,636
Rym: You narrow shit.

1228
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:54,307
Rym: Beer is Carlton, Carlton dress mediocre.

1229
01:03:54,407 --> 01:03:55,531
Scott: It's basically, isn't it?

1230
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:58,220
Scott: sort of like, uh, no, what's it called?

1231
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,724
Scott: What's that shit that people drink in New York?

1232
01:04:01,227 --> 01:04:01,709
Scott: No, no.

1233
01:04:02,992 --> 01:04:05,498
Rym: Uh, Emily's yelling suggestions.

1234
01:04:05,518 --> 01:04:06,421
Scott: It's not that one.

1235
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:08,307
Scott: It's a mediocre beer.

1236
01:04:08,688 --> 01:04:11,396
Rym: It's a step below Stella in terms of goodness.

1237
01:04:12,038 --> 01:04:12,599
Scott: Just man.

1238
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:12,840
Scott: Yeah.

1239
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,282
Scott: That's right.

1240
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:13,564
Scott: Stella.

1241
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:14,027
Scott: That's the one.

1242
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:16,341
Rym: It's not the same kind of beer really, but it's mediocre beer.

1243
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:16,924
Scott: But it's the same.

1244
01:04:16,964 --> 01:04:21,846
Rym: It feels the same as niche and there's this local blonde that's like the other local beer also kind of meh.

1245
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:27,788
Rym: But uh, we went to this Mexican restaurant, a family Mexican cantina because it was late at night.

1246
01:04:27,808 --> 01:04:29,234
Scott: There was only two other people there.

1247
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:32,467
Rym: Not a lot of Mexican food in Australia.

1248
01:04:32,528 --> 01:04:32,748
Scott: Nope.

1249
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:34,114
Scott: So we're like, well, let's check this out.

1250
01:04:34,355 --> 01:04:35,420
Rym: So we go to this place.

1251
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:38,171
Rym: It's like 45 minutes before the place is supposed to close.

1252
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:39,897
Rym: There's one girl up front.

1253
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:42,368
Rym: There's some people finishing a meal and about to leave.

1254
01:04:42,448 --> 01:04:44,035
Rym: So we're like, yeah, table for two.

1255
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:49,648
Rym: And it was just quiet and empty and surreal and weird.

1256
01:04:50,049 --> 01:04:50,710
Scott: So we are.

1257
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,674
Scott: So we order and super hungry.

1258
01:04:52,834 --> 01:04:53,255
Scott: Every plate.

1259
01:04:53,275 --> 01:04:59,150
Scott: We're so far has had normal size portions, not American portions.

1260
01:04:59,390 --> 01:04:59,611
Scott: Right.

1261
01:05:00,052 --> 01:05:03,824
Scott: So we ordered a big nacho and just an entree each.

1262
01:05:04,045 --> 01:05:04,245
Rym: Yup.

1263
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:12,736
Rym: So we wait in like 40 minutes go by and now it's like five minutes before the place closes and we get our nachos at some point and they're gigantic.

1264
01:05:12,897 --> 01:05:14,384
Rym: They're, they're more food that we can eat.

1265
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:20,529
Rym: So we're picking at him like assuming we're going to eat a bunch and take a bunch home and our main dishes never come.

1266
01:05:21,693 --> 01:05:23,418
Scott: It's meanwhile, eventually we sit there.

1267
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:25,265
Scott: It's quiet and eerie and surreal.

1268
01:05:25,285 --> 01:05:27,655
Scott: I think they refilled our water once or twice.

1269
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:36,488
Rym: And the lady comes over a few times and never bring, I think she was waiting for us to finish those fucking nachos before she was going to even start cooking our main dishes.

1270
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:37,150
Scott: Maybe.

1271
01:05:37,371 --> 01:05:37,793
Scott: I don't know.

1272
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:43,691
Scott: But then eventually after a super long time, it's way past closing time, they bring our actual meals.

1273
01:05:43,952 --> 01:05:46,158
Scott: Now gigantic.

1274
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:48,305
Rym: I'm full.

1275
01:05:48,485 --> 01:05:49,609
Scott: We can barely eat it.

1276
01:05:49,749 --> 01:05:53,320
Scott: I had, I got, it was like, mine was like a taco and an enchilada.

1277
01:05:54,402 --> 01:05:58,522
Rym: Like something I normally would have been able to eat, but I kept picking those nachos of other mush.

1278
01:05:59,204 --> 01:06:00,770
Rym: So we eat and even wasn't that good.

1279
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,058
Rym: So finally I go up to the front.

1280
01:06:03,098 --> 01:06:04,284
Rym: I was like, yeah, can we get the check?

1281
01:06:04,324 --> 01:06:04,927
Rym: I think we're done.

1282
01:06:05,148 --> 01:06:05,289
Scott: Yeah.

1283
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:09,129
Scott: And I was like, you know, I just wanted to take mine back cause I so much foods.

1284
01:06:09,149 --> 01:06:10,254
Scott: It's like a whole taco.

1285
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:11,139
Rym: Can we get a takeaway?

1286
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:12,646
Rym: And she's like, we don't allow takeaway.

1287
01:06:12,827 --> 01:06:13,771
Scott: And I'm like, what do you mean?

1288
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:16,444
Scott: So we're like, what are you going to do with that taco?

1289
01:06:16,665 --> 01:06:19,980
Scott: We look at this and I'm just like, I'm just like, fine, take, take my money.

1290
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:21,506
Scott: Getting out of this weird situation.

1291
01:06:21,627 --> 01:06:25,582
Rym: So now we leave like almost two hours after we walked into this place.

1292
01:06:25,883 --> 01:06:27,006
Rym: It's so late at night.

1293
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:28,370
Rym: I'm so tired.

1294
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,734
Rym: I'm so full.

1295
01:06:29,995 --> 01:06:34,710
Rym: We left multiple pounds of food behind us and the lady paid for a story.

1296
01:06:35,272 --> 01:06:41,231
Rym: And the lady, the reason it was so surreal is that it was quiet, like deathly quiet the whole time.

1297
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:51,221
Rym: The lady never said a non-functional word to us the entire time and never changed the completely blank expression on her face at any point.

1298
01:06:51,903 --> 01:06:55,837
Rym: And when we were like, we left and she just kind of stood there.

1299
01:06:56,057 --> 01:07:03,331
Rym: Like as we walked out, I looked back and she was just standing there behind the bar, like not doing anything, just kind of looking really weird.

1300
01:07:03,411 --> 01:07:04,034
Scott: It was weird.

1301
01:07:04,094 --> 01:07:05,780
Rym: We went back to our seahorsee hotel.

1302
01:07:06,321 --> 01:07:07,064
Rym: That was pretty great.

1303
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:09,816
Scott: It was, it was a typical drive in motel.

1304
01:07:09,837 --> 01:07:12,985
Scott: It was a beach, vacation kind of place.

1305
01:07:13,045 --> 01:07:13,868
Rym: So that was kind of fun.

1306
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:14,129
Rym: Yep.

1307
01:07:14,712 --> 01:07:21,745
Rym: And at this beach motel in the winter, we were like some of the only people there were maybe a handful of people staying at this place and it was a great place.

1308
01:07:22,066 --> 01:07:27,182
Rym: But the guy who checked us in was super nice, super friendly tourist, welcoming guy.

1309
01:07:27,303 --> 01:07:29,572
Rym: He knew everything about this island.

1310
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:30,355
Scott: Yeah.

1311
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:30,837
Scott: He lives there.

1312
01:07:31,038 --> 01:07:32,888
Rym: And then he starts giving us advice like, well, you should do this.

1313
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:33,432
Rym: You should do this.

1314
01:07:33,734 --> 01:07:35,464
Rym: Oh, you might be able to take a boat to go with these.

1315
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:35,926
Rym: The seals.

1316
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:38,879
Scott: He's like, he's like, he tells us about the seals.

1317
01:07:38,959 --> 01:07:40,688
Scott: And I'm like, is there a boat that goes to the seals?

1318
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:41,653
Scott: He says, let me check.

1319
01:07:42,276 --> 01:07:45,950
Scott: And he gets a computer printout of the boat status of that day.

1320
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:54,946
Rym: Not just the boat status, but the status of the seas, all the ferries, all the, everything that happens on the island, whether or not it's like how high tech is this little island.

1321
01:07:55,006 --> 01:07:58,259
Scott: And this little motel is hooked up to the high tech island system.

1322
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,789
Scott: No place in the U S is like that.

1323
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,909
Rym: We want to see the koala preserve because koalas kind of got out.

1324
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,997
Rym: They kind of got out competed by the world.

1325
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:12,054
Rym: They're not the most efficient animal, so they need a lot of help to not be extinct.

1326
01:08:12,335 --> 01:08:16,310
Scott: So we went to the preserve to see them and they're sleeping as they said they would be.

1327
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:16,633
Rym: Yeah.

1328
01:08:16,653 --> 01:08:19,805
Rym: They're basically just balls of fur that hang out in trees, not moving.

1329
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:21,571
Scott: They move, not a lot.

1330
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:26,731
Rym: And one of them long enough to scratch his stomach for a little bit and then go back to sleep.

1331
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:27,374
Rym: It was kind of cute.

1332
01:08:27,756 --> 01:08:28,439
Scott: That's what I would do.

1333
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:29,783
Rym: Have you ever koala?

1334
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:30,225
Scott: Yep.

1335
01:08:30,688 --> 01:08:33,642
Scott: I mostly, I was actually more impressed with all the birdies than the koalas.

1336
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,652
Rym: Oh, the bird photography and the birds.

1337
01:08:35,671 --> 01:08:36,053
Rym: We're all took.

1338
01:08:36,073 --> 01:08:38,023
Rym: My favorite bird is that little blue rain.

1339
01:08:38,264 --> 01:08:39,830
Scott: You like the blue guy, little blue guy.

1340
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:43,749
Scott: I actually like the guy that we just saw even outside preserve areas.

1341
01:08:43,769 --> 01:08:44,513
Scott: It's like in the city.

1342
01:08:44,593 --> 01:08:45,800
Scott: He was sort of white and black.

1343
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:49,362
Scott: And it's like, Oh, that looks sort of like an interesting tropical bird, but he's just sort of everywhere.

1344
01:08:49,582 --> 01:08:49,764
Rym: Yeah.

1345
01:08:49,804 --> 01:08:53,639
Rym: There were a bunch of parrots on the, uh, the, uh, old racetrack that I went to.

1346
01:08:55,582 --> 01:08:56,828
Rym: We might have to do multiple shows.

1347
01:08:56,849 --> 01:08:57,734
Rym: We got on for a while.

1348
01:08:57,754 --> 01:08:59,624
Rym: I got a lot of cool stuff to say still about Australia.

1349
01:08:59,865 --> 01:09:00,126
Scott: Yeah.

1350
01:09:00,468 --> 01:09:02,015
Scott: Australia is a lot going on there.

1351
01:09:02,035 --> 01:09:02,256
Rym: Yeah.

1352
01:09:02,276 --> 01:09:04,666
Rym: We didn't even talk about how Scott broke his arm.

1353
01:09:05,127 --> 01:09:06,153
Scott: Oh, I guess we didn't.

1354
01:09:06,394 --> 01:09:06,635
Rym: Yeah.

1355
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:07,398
Rym: We'll save that for it.

1356
01:09:07,438 --> 01:09:08,684
Rym: We'll do another Australia show.

1357
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:09,026
Rym: Good.

1358
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:10,272
Scott: We'll get through another Thursday.

1359
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:12,202
Scott: This is what happens when you save your laser.

1360
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:14,612
Scott: So much more to laser, not fully uncharged.

1361
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:18,203
Rym: We've barely even scratched the surface of the cool shit that happened to us in Australia.

1362
01:09:18,544 --> 01:09:19,064
Scott: All right, good.

1363
01:09:25,216 --> 01:09:27,764
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1364
01:09:27,804 --> 01:09:32,644
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1365
01:09:32,844 --> 01:09:37,923
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1366
01:09:38,144 --> 01:09:40,836

1367
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:45,595
