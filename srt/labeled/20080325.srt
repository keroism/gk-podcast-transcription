Rym: We're all Let's do this You know today.

5
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:39,147
Rym: It was one of those days where ended up taking a different train home The same train I say possibly.

6
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:40,551
Rym: I took a somewhat later train.

7
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:50,055
Rym: the funny thing is I take the 410 home usually and if I Miss that because I stay late at work and a lot of times It'll be like 358 and then suddenly someone will be like hey.

8
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:51,400
Rym: Can you do this real quick, and I'm like.

9
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:57,553
Scott: That's why I always leave work with like a buffer time.

10
00:00:57,593 --> 00:01:01,248
Scott: that way if someone asked me to do something I you know if it takes me ten minutes.

11
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:03,497
Scott: I can still make it, but I work seven.

12
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:13,800
Rym: tough for Can't leave early really yeah, but I get like an hour plus lunch, so it works out, but son It's like I got to do this, and it wasn't even like it was crap work.

13
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,449
Rym: There's actually something I wanted to do.

14
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:21,135
Rym: it just came at a somewhat inopportune time So I did it and I stayed late, and it's like it.

15
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:26,016
Rym: once it hits like 404 I pretty much have to get up and go or I'm not gonna make the train.

16
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:30,280
Rym: mm-hmm Man, it's so great though that I can walk to the train in like five minutes.

17
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:32,591
Scott: Yeah, I gotta take a little subway to the tree.

18
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:34,520
Rym: It's not even like five minutes from leaving work.

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,850
Rym: It's five minutes from when I log out of my computer.

20
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:38,573
Scott: Yep.

21
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:40,900
Scott: You work across the street from the train station.

22
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:41,984
Rym: The best thing ever.

23
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:46,400
Rym: yeah, well, I think the best thing ever would be working from home, but I can do that.

24
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:50,514
Scott: Yeah, I guess I technically could but you know I wouldn't.

25
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:55,500
Rym: if I could if I was gonna work from home I wouldn't want to work from home more than like a day or two a week, or I'd probably go crazy.

26
00:01:56,042 --> 00:02:01,763
Scott: No, I could work from home every day because I just wouldn't be sitting in front of the computer all day like I am at Work.

27
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:02,328
Scott: I would be.

28
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,115
Scott: you know I do work.

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:15,226
Rym: Well, I think it's more that by going like I like going into the city And I don't mind my train ride or anything it just be nice to like every other Friday Be able to wake up at 659 to be at work at 7.

30
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:17,653
Rym: Yeah Of course I used to do that at IBM.

31
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:23,875
Rym: I'd wake up at like Show up to work unshaven and flannel.

32
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:25,452
Scott: yeah Yeah, anyway.

33
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:28,503
Rym: So I had to take this late train home And it pretty much.

34
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:34,741
Rym: if I miss the 410 the next one is the 445. the 445 gets home 15 minutes before the 509.

35
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:38,114
Rym: The 509 because the 509 is like the most ultra express.

36
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:41,546
Rym: it pretty much goes Grand Central Harlem beacon.

37
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:43,177
Scott: yeah, that's does it even do.

38
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:52,021
Scott: Harlem Because the the one after the 509 the 528 goes Grand Central Beacon.

39
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,749
Rym: I've taken that train a couple times.

40
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:56,241
Rym: That's a real nice train, but it's at 528.

41
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:58,352
Scott: So the 509 is much is better still.

42
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:01,480
Rym: the 509 is like the best train You can take if you work it into your schedule.

43
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:11,082
Rym: Yeah But I ended up taking the 509 because I don't want to take the 445. the 509 gets me there at about the same time and I have more time to dick around in the city in less time On a train.

44
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:15,840
Scott: yeah, I'll take the 445 if I can get on it because it's still get home 15 minutes earlier.

45
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:23,051
Scott: Oh, yeah But I decide it's also easier to get out of the parking lot on the 445 because there's less beacon people on it because there's people for the other stuff.

46
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:26,120
Rym: That's true, but anyway, so I get on the train.

47
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:28,229
Rym: I'm walking like all right got to find a seat.

48
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,580
Rym: this trains always ultra crowded and there's Scott.

49
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:31,242
Scott: So

50
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:48,479
Rym: I walk up and I say something to him and I this I can't say like haha Scott because the same thing happens To me ever be like a situation where you do not expect anyone to speak to you at all Because there's no chance of anyone, you know being around there's no chance of anyone like interacting with you.

51
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:56,527
Rym: you're just sitting there in a foreign place doing something and suddenly someone like says something to you and you're Yeah, Scott went up and I went haha.

52
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,571
Rym: then I sat down next to him.

53
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:58,695
Scott: I went after.

54
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:00,280
Scott: you went haha loudly.

55
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,888

Scott: you were like, haha.

58
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:07,367
Scott: Suddenly, it wasn't that loud like the haha guy.

59
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:10,114
Rym: No, I don't believe I went ha ha.

60
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,320
Scott: No, not Nelson the haha guy.

61
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:15,303
Rym: Oh, that's more of a haha You're all.

62
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,367
Scott: you're almost like that.

63
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,632
Rym: I don't think I was.

64
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:18,074
Scott: they were.

65
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:22,971
Rym: I think you were just too Used to the quiet train in my very quiet utterance of huh?

66
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:24,676

67
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:26,926
Scott: you had a loud, haha I don't think so.

68
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:29,720
Rym: But anyway anyway, so because I took this train it's like alright.

69
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:31,191
Rym: What am I gonna do in the city?

70
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,400
Rym: I want to get something accomplished.

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,380
Rym: I don't want to just like go down and eat a bunch of samosa and then get like a coffee or a corona or something.

72
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,917
Rym: So I go over to the H&M and I find out that linen suits are on sale and hot damn.

73
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:43,920
Rym: Do I like linen?

74
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,200
Rym: Of all the things you can make a shirt out of number one is silk.

75
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:51,080
Rym: Silk is like the best thing ever, but number two is linen.

76
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:57,440
Rym: I'll wear linen any time any place any day and I got these two awesome linen blazers for like 40 bucks.

77
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:00,108
Scott: What do you need them for to wear?

78
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:01,552
Scott: Why don't you have clothes?

79
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:02,756
Rym: not enough?

80
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,240
Scott: How do you not have enough clothes?

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,045
Rym: I only own like three blazers.

82
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:07,149
Rym: I needed a couple different.

83
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,996
Scott: I own one and I never use it.

84
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:13,477
Rym: I Work at a place where I have to wear blazers like often I have to dress up.

85
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:14,100
Rym: I gotta look nice.

86
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,327
Scott: I wouldn't work at such a place.

87
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,279
Rym: I prefer to work at such a place.

88
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,040
Rym: Yeah, like one thing that bothered me about you prefer to spend money on useless clothing.

89
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,460
Rym: I don't know but I think I look good in a blazer and I like to wear that sort of thing.

90
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,669
Scott: You care about what you look like when you're sitting in an office where no one cares Everyone cares and everyone's very stylish in my office.

91
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,170
Rym: Actually, except for they're all you're all vain Assholes, no, we're just very vain.

92
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,373
Rym: I said vain Yes, but you added something to that.

93
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:43,199
Rym: I'm all about vain.

94
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,499
Rym: Vanity is a virtue not a sin.

95
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,612
Scott: No, it's not a sin because no such thing as a sin, but vanity is a waste of time and resources.

96
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:58,566
Scott: I I would wear pajamas.

97
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:00,916
Scott: All right, everyone in my work would wear pajamas.

98
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:01,980
Scott: Anybody didn't wear pajamas.

99
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,170
Scott: I'd be like, are you going somewhere special today?

100
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,476
Scott: Is there like a wedding or something?

101
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:06,180
Scott: What's going on?

102
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:17,408
Rym: Well part of it too is that I realized that I dress really nice for work and when I go out But then on the weekends when like all my friends are over I'm doing stuff around town I dress basically like a hobo.

103
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:21,280
Scott: I would add the world would be best if I dressed like a hobo all the time.

104
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:33,519
Rym: There's one time Scott and I went to a restaurant in town and I Think they balked at serving us at first because it looked like some punk kid and a hobo Watered into this nice restaurant like off the street.

105
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:38,373
Scott: Why I always wear the cheapest clothes that are comfortable and keep warm.

106
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:39,477
Scott: that is the requirements.

107
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:41,670
Scott: comfort number one Keeping warm.

108
00:06:41,731 --> 00:06:44,453
Scott: number two Comfort cheap is number three.

109
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:45,360
Rym: comfort is number one.

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,705
Rym: But number two is looking good.

111
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,553
Scott: looking good is not even on the list.

112
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:53,474
Scott: the clothes could be like, all right Perlin in like live.

113
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:54,760
Rym: let's have a comparison here.

114
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,513
Rym: How many times has a girl and any point in your life said to you?

115
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:02,972
Rym: Hey, you look sexy in that Zero because I don't care.

116
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:05,664
Rym: Ah I'm pointing out a correlation.

117
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:07,770
Scott: Yeah a correlation.

118
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,176
Scott: where the correlation is you care.

119
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,399
Scott: I don't okay.

120
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:18,525
Rym: Anyway to all of you out there a lot of people don't really look at what their clothes are made out of and I It kind of matters.

121
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:23,540
Rym: for example a shirt that's made out of 99% polyester is not a good shirt.

122
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,528
Rym: It is not going to be comfortable or look good.

123
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:26,532
Scott: What are you talking about?

124
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,456
Scott: This goes awesome.

125
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:28,420
Rym: This goes awesome.

126
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,285
Rym: Polyester makes you smell.

127
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:33,233
Scott: Yeah, you just don't wear it too long.

128
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:37,405
Rym: No, you gotta wear an undershirt under it or you will say Your.

129
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:42,711
Rym: but I gotta tell you linen is such an underused Fabric for clothing and I'm all about barely

130
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,580
Scott: not because you were able to get a whole bunch of it

131
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:51,501
Rym: Yes, but not many people wear linen compared to how many people wear like rayon and stuff or like rayon linen mixtures This I'm

132
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:52,123
Scott: pretty sure.

133
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:56,456
Scott: the cotton is like the number one most worn and cotton is crap except for underwear.

134
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:57,760
Scott: cotton is awesome for everything.

135
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:02,320
Rym: Yeah, I likes me some wool too, but not as much as linen.

136
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,730
Scott: Seinfeld it's gonna learn you something.

137
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:05,495
Scott: gabardine.

138
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:07,828
Rym: Yeah, no No, you know what?

139
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:09,376
Rym: I learned from Seinfeld velour.

140
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:16,725
Scott: No Episode where that he gets the Yankees to work on no, and then then it fails Catastrophically, it's the worst thing.

141
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:17,086
Scott: that's good.

142
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,014
Scott: Someone does not use the washing machine privately.

143
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:20,280
Rym: Oh, no, that's cuz it rained.

00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,940
Rym: You're like a witch anyway.

00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,199
Rym: Anyway, so what do you got in the news?

147
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,149
Scott: Alright, so there's sort of like this big combo news.

148
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:32,892
Scott: Do we even tie?

149
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,799
Scott: I feel like part of its old and part of its new.

150
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,794
Rym: Basically part of it's something.

151
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:38,419
Rym: part of its blue.

153
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,560
Scott: So all the guitars in rock band are like Stratocaster isn't telecasters and whatnot?

154
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:51,540
Rym: I don't remember if it was a Stratocaster or a telecast.

155
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,789
Scott: Well, it's not hard to tell the difference wasn't?

156
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:58,969
Rym: the Stratocaster has sort of like this like Combination of the perfect car.

157
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,026
Scott: the telecaster doesn't have that Top from which to strike.

158
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:06,360
Rym: it's sort of stubbier and I once killed a man with an electric guitar.

159
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:18,360
Scott: It's like for your pickups in the restraint line, but the Stratocaster sort of angle anyway, the And the guitar heroes ever since Guitar Hero 1 has a licensing deal with Gibson's.

160
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,269
Scott: They have the Gibson guitars like the Les Paul.

161
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:29,540
Rym: and so I point out that the only reason that Gibson is inferior in my eyes Because I don't know enough about guitars to know or care and I don't even think I can tell the difference if I listen to.

162
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,116
Rym: but Meatloaf talked a lot about one of the two and did not talk a lot about the other of the two.

163
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:38,980
Rym: and I base all Of my guitar knowledge on meatloaf.

164
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,763
Scott: I based it on.

165
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:44,539
Scott: I like the way the shape of a Stratocaster better than I like the shape of the other guitars.

166
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,372
Scott: about the Telecaster, I know it's kind of kind of stubby.

167
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:48,176
Rym: Yeah, it kind of is.

168
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:53,066
Scott: Yeah anyway So that's the way it's been.

169
00:09:53,166 --> 00:10:17,220
Scott: but basically the story that's in the news is Gibson suing pretty much every maker of toy guitars and guitar heroes and rock bands for patent infringement, but I'm saying the real story has something to do with a. they got into a fight with the Guitar hero people about the licensing somehow because I think you're not gonna see Gibson licensing on the next guitar hero.

170
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,923
Scott: I have a feeling

171
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:31,893
Rym: I mean this might be reminiscent of what happened way back with Final Fantasy and Nintendo Where I mean there were a lot of reasons for Final Fantasy being pulled from Nintendo and put on other platforms, but Independent of those there was a personal falling out between the two companies.

172
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,000
Scott: Yes, I think you know, it's sort of like Gibson.

173
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,091
Scott: You know this patent or whatever bullshit.

174
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,760
Scott: I'm pretty sure the patent argument they're making is bullshit.

175
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,560
Scott: It's not gonna fly and everyone's just gonna laugh them away.

176
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,971
Rym: Well, remember anytime a crazy patent thing like this comes up.

177
00:10:46,432 --> 00:11:00,114
Rym: There are only two but well, there's three But really there's only two possible and likely outcomes either the patent is found to be crap proving once again, the patents are like this or crap or The patent is enforced which makes everyone angry.

178
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:01,419
Rym: Yeah, it's win-win.

179
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:09,800
Scott: so Basically Gibson I think is pissed off at the guitar hero people for screwing them on the licensing deal or something.

180
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:25,744
Scott: They weren't happy and now they're basically taking their patent and they still want to make money because you know Fender and the other company is doing just fine And so they're gonna go stomp it all over everybody and I think really because of guitar hero and rock band and such Mostly because a guitar hero.

181
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:37,980
Scott: suddenly these, you know guitar making companies which has just been sitting around quietly for years and years You know producing their guitars are suddenly like making a lot more money than they're used to and now they're starting to get crazy.

182
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:41,115
Scott: But they're mostly their business is making guitars.

183
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,280
Scott: They don't know what the hell they're doing.

184
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:56,218
Rym: I don't think I need to point out the absolute hilarity and irony of the fact that the guitar Industry is getting boosted by fake guitars and people pretending to play the guitar.

185
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:58,268
Scott: Yeah Yeah, well, you know.

186
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:04,240
Scott: and the one hand it does boost it in that You know people play the fake guitar and it generates interest in playing the real guitar.

187
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:10,551
Scott: Then they find out and then they go to buy a real guitar and they're probably gonna buy You know one of the ones that they like looking at.

188
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:15,873
Rym: if you thought that fourth and fifth Quote-unquote colored fret was giving you trouble.

189
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:17,660
Rym: Wait till you try to play a real guitar kids.

190
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:25,468
Scott: Well, some of the stuff in guitar here on the super hard modes is harder than some stuff on a real guitar harder But not analogous.

191
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:26,998
Scott: No, not analogous at all.

192
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:30,627
Scott: anyway The combination news with that.

193
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:37,320
Scott: It's sort of that's a newer news that you probably may have not heard that Is that the rock band is coming to the Wii, right?

194
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:41,817
Scott: So the rock band was only on the other systems But now it's gonna be on the Wii.

195
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:45,776
Rym: now We've been holding out on a lot of this stuff because what console is gonna have it all?

196
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:48,326
Rym: I don't want to buy an Xbox And blah and find out the blind.

197
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:50,555
Rym: then everything's coming out on the Wii that I care about.

198
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:51,800
Scott: So yep, so it's alright.

199
00:12:53,900 --> 00:13:00,487
Scott: So the thing is is that the guitar hero guitar the one that we already have is not gonna work With the rock band on the Wii.

200
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:03,580
Rym: now, I don't think I need to say that that's bullshit.

201
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:10,060
Rym: So I think instead is that we're so not buying that second guitar hero guitar now.

202
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,449
Scott: No, there's no way we're buying a second guitar hero guitar.

203
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,900
Rym: In fact, does anyone want to buy a guitar hero from us?

204
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:16,664
Rym: Hey, I bought it.

205
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:17,587
Rym: You never paid me back.

206
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,536
Scott: I guess but I mailed away to get the replacement disc.

207
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,189
Rym: Yeah, doesn't matter I'm so done with guitar hero.

208
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,802
Rym: Like I just I know I said, oh, I'm gonna get good at this You know what?

209
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:27,528
Rym: I take that back.

210
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,240
Rym: I don't think I'm ever gonna play that game again.

211
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,000
Scott: Well, I did I got good at it.

212
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,279
Scott: But the thing is the hardest part of guitar hero 3 when it gets to like expert mode is so hard It's just not worth it.

213
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,759
Scott: Like I play play guitar hero 3 to the point where I probably could beat guitar hero 2 which is much easier.

214
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:48,100
Scott: an expert I'm pretty sure I could beat all of rock band an expert at least with the guitar instrument.

215
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:57,738
Scott: But there's no way it's worth it to beat the harder parts of guitar hero 3 I guess and I really don't care about unlocking characters and such a lot unlocked all the songs.

216
00:13:57,758 --> 00:13:58,200
Scott: That's enough.

217
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:04,048
Rym: I just feel like rock band in terms of enjoy cuz think about it The only time even though I never played rock band.

218
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:05,313
Rym: I played it a couple times.

219
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:07,518
Rym: I can say this in our crew I don't know.

220
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:14,199
Rym: I mean I see a lot of crews this way because we've gone to parties where there were a lot of Non front row crew people there and it's always the same thing.

221
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:22,699
Rym: a lot of people have guitar hero, but they don't play it that much and People who own guitar hero either become super good at it and play it all the time or almost never play it.

222
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:40,260
Rym: But then when there's a party and there's too many people to work for everyone at the party to engage everyone at the same time You know when there's like just way too many people for you all to like watch a movie or play a game at once Then they'll have like guitar hero on in the living room and they'll be like five or six people Kind of alternating and playing it at any one time.

223
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,580
Rym: It kind of keeps the dynamic of a party going and it's really this kind of party in game.

224
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:46,667
Rym: But it can have it most.

225
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:47,210
Rym: two people.

226
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:53,055
Rym: rock band not only has four people It has four wildly different roles and these well not wildly different.

227
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,200
Scott: there's two guitar rolls.

228
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:00,240
Scott: Well, so it's the same game only added draw added one drum and one microphone which is a lot.

229
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,104
Scott: It's a lot.

230
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:04,720
Scott: but I actually I think a problem of rock band is that pretty much everyone just wants to play the drum.

231
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:06,324
Scott: No one wants to.

232
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:13,780
Rym: actually I see too because a lot of people say they never want to play the drum because unlike the other Ones it's actually a little bit difficult because it's kind of like a real instrument.

233
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,910
Rym: But in terms of it also has this kind of spectator enjoyment?

234
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:22,360
Rym: watching someone play guitar hero is not entertaining at all.

235
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:25,600
Rym: Watching someone play rock band is often entertaining.

236
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,728
Scott: Well only mostly for the singing part.

237
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:31,000
Scott: if someone can sing it's sort of it the same as watching someone do carrier.

238
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,105
Rym: Oh listening to someone do karaoke But I'm saying it adds that element.

239
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:38,960
Rym: and as a cruise hanging out party game in the background rock band is much better than guitar.

240
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:47,526
Scott: Yeah, but I think the thing is is the people who make the rock band basically blamed the guitar hero people saying it's their fault For not for making it not work.

241
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,453
Scott: and I'm like, uh, wait a minute.

242
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:51,320
Scott: No, no, no, that's not gonna fly with me.

243
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,000
Scott: You know sure that you know, maybe they made the guitar hero guitar in a shitty way, which I'll believe.

244
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:57,523
Scott: Oh, they did I'll easily believe.

245
00:15:57,543 --> 00:16:02,382
Rym: but we pointed out that the way the guitar hero guitar works on the Wii is Broken.

246
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:03,766
Rym: it is straight-up broken.

247
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:08,583
Scott: Yep, but the rock band people came to the Wii Second.

248
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:15,845
Scott: therefore there is no reason that they could not have made the rock band guitar Compatible guitar.

249
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:19,174
Rym: they might have tried and said wow, it doesn't work the way it should.

250
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:19,876
Rym: it's broken.

251
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:21,500
Scott: screw this guitar hero.

252
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,503
Scott: They made it work.

253
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:25,955
Scott: You know, it's not only even so I'd rat it's it.

254
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:27,620
Scott: it's sort of like that issue.

255
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,980
Scott: Are you gonna make it backwards compatible in this case?

256
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:35,400
Scott: I think that making it backwards compatible would have been more valuable to the consumer than making it.

257
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,488
Scott: You know, I basically now Think of all the guitar hero.

258
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:43,180
Scott: guitar under the hood may work in a shitty way.

259
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:48,080
Rym: It plays the game just fine, but now they're gonna get people to buy more of their guitars.

260
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,934
Rym: Maybe no one's gonna say never mind on rock band.

261
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:53,200
Rym: I have to buy a different guitar.

262
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:56,740
Rym: I think if anything people are gonna say wow screw guitar hero.

263
00:16:56,921 --> 00:17:00,975
Scott: I think what it actually does is people who are not in the know, right?

264
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:02,380
Scott: People aren't hardcore about it.

265
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,791
Scott: They're probably not buying both guitar hero and rock band.

266
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:19,920
Scott: That's not you know, but I Think that people who are in the know since they know that these things aren't compatible You're gonna see and you've already seen it already Is that people just buy the guitar heroes and the rock bands now on the 360 because of the downloadable?

267
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,267
Scott: Content and because the guitar.

268
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:23,720
Scott: it's the only system where all the guitars are compatible.

269
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:30,411
Rym: Well, I think it also helps that most people who are into this sort of thing have a 360 I know but opposed to a ps3.

270
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:34,328
Scott: but people who are into this thing They're specifically saying hi, it's time to buy rhythm games.

271
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:37,056
Scott: Which system will I buy the rhythm games for?

272
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:38,120
Scott: Oh that one?

273
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:42,460
Rym: Yes, well the thing is if I already had an Xbox I would get it on the Xbox.

274
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:46,760
Rym: The only reason I haven't is because I know I won't have time to play Xbox games anytime soon.

275
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:50,479
Rym: So I'm not gonna get an Xbox so I'll play it on the Wii.

276
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:56,798
Scott: Yeah, but actually the sudden funny happened today, you know, I have this Sony credit card that I got long ago.

277
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:58,900
Scott: randomly I basically said I need a credit card.

278
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,540
Scott: I went to a credit card website and there were like choices of cards and I was like Sony free gadgets.

279
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:06,260
Scott: Whatever right that was before way before Sony was evil.

280
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:08,499
Scott: You're like ps1 days for talking here.

281
00:18:09,002 --> 00:18:13,216
Scott: so I got that card and now I get like points and I can use the points to get Sony stuff.

282
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:19,860
Scott: and if I Go to like the store and buy a Sony product like let's say I buy a hundred dollar Sony product, right?

283
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:27,200
Scott: I can go to fill out a form and spend 10,000 points and then Sony will give me a refund on the you know.

284
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:27,823
Scott: So it's.

285
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:28,004
Scott: it's.

286
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:30,500
Scott: it's basically like one penny per point.

287
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:40,799
Scott: But if I go to the Sony rewards catalog, which is a special catalog I can just buy things with points and if I don't have enough points, they'll just charge my credit card the extra money.

288
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:47,500
Scott: The thing is if you actually calculate the you know, one penny per point in the you know rewards catalog.

289
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:50,960
Scott: The rewards catalog is hideously overpriced.

290
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:53,530
Scott: However, they there was a deal.

291
00:18:53,550 --> 00:19:02,540
Scott: I got in the email and the deal said Buy an HDTV on the list in the rewards catalog and we'll give you a free ps3.

292
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:04,531
Rym: God, damn it.

293
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:05,460
Rym: We're gonna get a ps3?

294
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,943
Rym: No, we're not.

295
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:07,665
Scott: why not?

296
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:12,300
Scott: because I went and I looked at the HDTVs in the rewards.

297
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,335
Rym: Can they cost exactly the price of an HDTV plus the cost of a 360 or a ps3?

298
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,451
Scott: The cheapest one was two hundred thousand points, which is tooth wall.

299
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:27,320
Scott: two hundred fifty thousand points, which is twenty five hundred dollars Minus the price of a ps3 $1,900.

300
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,970
Scott: right that HDTV was like a $900 HDTV.

301
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:36,139
Scott: Wow Yeah, the rewards catalog is the ultimate ripoff.

302
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:41,073
Rym: Luckily when I got my credit card thing I want the Geico credit card because I used to drive to work a lot.

303
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,440
Rym: So I got three percent off gas.

304
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:43,966
Scott: That's a little bit of a help.

305
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:47,680
Scott: I'm thinking I'm gonna get a second credit card that has a different kind of reward thing.

306
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,272
Scott: Maybe I'll get the Linux credit card.

307
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:49,674
Scott: I don't know.

308
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:50,420
Scott: We'll see.

309
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:54,860
Rym: Yeah, I mean the Geico one is good because all my car stuff gets like super discount.

310
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,728
Scott: Yeah, the thing is I don't have that much car stuff.

311
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,190
Scott: Yeah.

312
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,440
Scott: Well, I did and triple-a discounts on a lot of that.

313
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:02,326
Rym: Even I don't have to play You know, I went.

314
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:05,076
Scott: I bought new tires right at the all-season tires.

315
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:06,180
Scott: I took off the snow tires.

316
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:07,946
Scott: You know, my dad was like here.

317
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,580
Scott: take my little triple-a card because there's a triple-a discount at the tire store, right?

318
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:15,765
Scott: So I go over to the tire store and I'm like, yeah Isn't there a triple-a discount?

319
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:19,760
Scott: the guys just like yup, and he just takes it off didn't ask to see my card or anything.

320
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:21,246
Scott: You don't need the triple-a card.

321
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:28,472
Rym: actually, actually, I don't know if they fixed this but as of a few years ago My triple-a actually expired last millennium.

322
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:29,676
Scott: mine did.

323
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:31,080
Scott: mine expired in like 2001.

324
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:41,828
Rym: I kept the card though because when I'm an old man I can show young kids and be like this was my triple-a card and they'll see the dates and it'll say 1998 whoa, and they'll go.

325
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:51,167
Rym: Wow old man Wow Yeah, but so I let it expire and a couple of years ago I needed some maps right and you could.

326
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:56,547
Rym: I mean now it's not as much of a deal because now like MapQuest has awesome maps

327
00:20:56,567 --> 00:21:00,080
Scott: and Google Maps has also awesome as about two bad directions, but good maps

328
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:08,667
Rym: Yeah, but back in the day like in the 90s and the early 2000s MapQuest directions were garbage Compared to the triple-a directions.

329
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:12,800
Rym: if you wanted directions you went to triple-a and if you were a member they were free.

330
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:16,600
Rym: In fact, someone would sit down with you draw the whole route.

331
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:27,589
Scott: Yeah, if you went to the triple-a store like they would get out a triptych They would print out a custom map for you and take a highlighter and highlight your whole route and they'd even warn you like There might be traffic here.

332
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,400
Rym: If there is get off this exit.

333
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,530
Rym: Here's the alternate route to avoid the traffic.

334
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:33,660
Rym: if you want to avoid tolls go this way.

335
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:35,715
Rym: There's a good place to eat right here here and here.

336
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,320
Scott: Yeah, we did.

337
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,000
Scott: We got the triptych on when we drove to Florida a couple times.

338
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,989
Scott: So basically you just drive turn the page drive turn the page.

339
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,872
Scott: It's it's great.

340
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:43,413
Scott: Actually.

341
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:45,560
Scott: Yeah, but now we have GPS's.

342
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,363
Scott: That's sort of dead.

343
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:52,132
Rym: Well, then they started letting you get triptychs on the internet And what you had to do is put in your card number.

344
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,480
Rym: I Discovered that the authentication does not check to see if your account is valid.

345
00:21:57,841 --> 00:22:04,382
Rym: It merely checks to see if your triple-a number matches the checksum that is integrated into your triple-a number Mm-hmm.

346
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:10,100
Rym: Hence if you if you even know a triple-a number that is valid this might have changed.

347
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:12,850
Rym: You can get triptychs completely forever for free.

348
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:16,464
Rym: Yep, just so you know Mm-hmm.

349
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,973
Rym: So anyway, I got some news here if you're done.

350
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:20,279
Scott: So I'm done.

351
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:25,586
Rym: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is dead to me in all incarnations.

352
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:27,700
Rym: check out this BS.

353
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:28,918
Rym: So first off.

354
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:30,786
Rym: well I got to take that back a little bit.

355
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,660
Rym: the GameCube Crystal Chronicles much like the GameCube Wario.

356
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,239
Rym: Where was the only worthwhile game in the series?

357
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,324
Rym: Mm-hmm, and here's the.

358
00:22:39,364 --> 00:22:39,946
Rym: here's the issue.

359
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:45,363
Rym: So they're gonna be two Crystal Chronicles games on the Wii really Just gonna be.

360
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,648
Scott: one have confused them.

361
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:53,751
Rym: there is Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles black Which is just my life as a king and that is the WiiWare one.

362
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:58,567
Rym: that's already out in Japan and it'll be out Actually was released today in Japan.

363
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:00,997
Rym: Whoa, and it'll be out in the u.s.

364
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:01,580
Rym: In May.

365
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:03,654
Rym: Okay, and it cost 1,500 Wii points.

366
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:05,079
Rym: All right.

367
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:12,580
Rym: Now then the real Crystal Chronicles game is going to be Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles not Ring of Fates.

368
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,676
Scott: I'm looking at the wrong ring of Fates of the DS one.

369
00:23:14,898 --> 00:23:17,068
Rym: Yes Da da da my life is a king.

370
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:19,478
Rym: and then Crystal Chronicles the Crystal Bearers.

371
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:19,880
Rym: Here we go.

372
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:21,247
Scott: Ah Crystal Bearers is the.

373
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,440
Scott: so that's gonna be a real Wii game on a Wii disc.

374
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:26,499
Rym: Yes Now which bullshit should I talk about first?

375
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:30,395
Scott: Well, we can talk about how Ring of Fates we own it and it sucks.

376
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,320
Rym: All right, here's the deal.

377
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:35,420
Rym: We're gonna review Ring of Fates probably next week or the week after for the DS.

378
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:37,370
Rym: But I'm gonna start by saying don't buy it.

379
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,033
Rym: Good God.

380
00:23:38,174 --> 00:23:39,279
Scott: Good God do not buy it.

381
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:42,000
Scott: I pre-ordered but we bought too too many copies.

382
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,620
Rym: I pre-ordered two copies because we figured all right.

383
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:51,840
Rym: We'll go for this because the first one was a good time and then later I pre-ordered a third copy But it was delayed because it was sold out.

384
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:55,800
Rym: Our first pre-orders came and the third one was for Emily.

385
00:23:56,582 --> 00:24:00,694
Rym: We played about five minutes of it and I canceled that pre-order for Emily.

386
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:02,740
Scott: Yeah, I gotta get rid of my copy.

387
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,759
Rym: Do you guys want anyone out there want the Crystal Chronicles for the DS?

388
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,306
Scott: It's sort of like it's.

389
00:24:07,387 --> 00:24:10,360
Scott: it's hard for us to take your money to give you something that's gonna hurt you.

390
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:13,899
Scott: It's like it's like selling you poison with the word food written on it.

391
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:18,057
Scott: but if you really want it, I guess that we can give it to somebody.

392
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:25,620
Rym: but Just to let you know that game is crap and we're gonna talk about exactly in every detail why it is crap.

393
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:39,126
Rym: Now the problem here is that they have done the same thing to the Crystal Chronicles Franchise that they have done to the Wario Ware franchise because the game that's coming out on the Wii Let me read here.

394
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:40,311
Rym: I'll go down.

395
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:42,720
Rym: I'm delaying because I got a bunch of windows open.

396
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:49,518
Rym: I'm scrolling down here to a statement that was made in an interview about the Crystal Chronicles Crystal Bearers.

397
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:55,564
Rym: for the Wii The Crystal Bearers is intended to be a more Single-player experience.

398
00:24:55,785 --> 00:25:09,100
Rym: quote, yeah as opposed to the GameCube install and installment which focused on cooperative play Players are expected to be able to use crafted items in multiplayer mode and items won in multiplayer within the single-player game.

399
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:14,234
Rym: Yeah, new items and accessories are intended to be shown visually on the characters.

400
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:15,758
Scott: Yeah, that's one thing.

401
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,680
Rym: Oh The game director stated that he wanted a more world weary protagonist.

402
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:22,815
Rym: He wanted him to seem rugged.

403
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:33,099
Rym: They intended the game to have a more mature design Now in other words more like all the other regular Final Fantasies.

404
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:34,887
Rym: So here's where I take issue with this.

405
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:39,587
Rym: much like how Wario Ware came out on the GameCube Which was the best war like.

406
00:25:39,627 --> 00:25:41,213
Rym: that is one of the best games ever made.

407
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:46,199
Rym: if you have friends over and you need to play A game together that is like the best freaking game.

408
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:54,883
Rym: Yep, and Crystal Chronicles for the GameCube was not the best game in the world But what it was was a proof of concept of something amazing Like.

409
00:25:55,063 --> 00:26:02,040
Rym: what it was was something that could have become this whole new amazing Genre of gaming that would have completely revolutionized console.

410
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,720
Scott: It was sort of taking the River City Ransom kind of thing to the next level and I think we've talked about this before.

411
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:23,400
Rym: But the the only good part about Crystal Chronicles on the GameCube was the fact that it was multiplayer Completely and there basically was no single-player game worth talking about Much like how Wario Ware on the GameCube was a multiplayer game with no single-player gameplay worth talking about.

412
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:32,060
Rym: Nintendo looked at both of these franchises and said well Obviously these games are popular due to their single-player content and no one cares about the multiplayer.

413
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:37,320
Rym: Let's totally fuck the multiplayer and remake the games and focus on the single-player crap that no one likes.

414
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:38,765
Scott: Well, I think you know.

415
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:43,160
Scott: my guess on this is that you know, you gotta remember Nintendo is mostly focusing.

416
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:49,000
Scott: You know, the games are made in Japan for Japanese people and we just sort of get the ports, you know.

417
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:55,719
Scott: So if something's popular in Japan Nintendo makes it and then whether we get it is pretty much just a decision.

418
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,663
Scott: whether Huh?

419
00:26:56,723 --> 00:26:58,291
Scott: Do you think Americans will like this or not?

420
00:26:58,311 --> 00:27:00,300
Scott: They're not making the games for us ever.

421
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,703
Scott: Yeah They don't take us in.

422
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:08,200
Scott: Nintendo doesn't take the United States market and our ideas into consideration in during the development process.

423
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:18,320
Rym: Really there's also the problem that well aside from having to worry about Japanese sensibilities Nintendo is one of the most risk-averse companies to have ever existed.

424
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,160
Scott: But you know these games are made by Square Enix.

425
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,940
Scott: It's just pretty much the same exact situation and Square Enix is basically as far as they're concerned.

426
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,660
Scott: It seems Final Fantasy is Final Fantasy and Crystal Chronicles is just Final Fantasy Nintendo version.

427
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:36,640
Scott: So I guess Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles isn't going the way they wanted.

428
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,211
Scott: So they just want to make it more like regular Final Fantasy.

429
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:46,640
Scott: Yeah, but even though the only Because the regular Final Fantasies do really well over in Japan and so did the Dragon Quest.

430
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,449
Scott: So they want to make the Crystal Chronicles more like those.

431
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:54,988
Rym: Yeah, the thing is to me Crystal Chronicles used to mean OMG multiplayer co-op.

432
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:58,420
Rym: now Crystal Chronicles means more Final Fantasy.

433
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:01,999
Rym: So that's two new Crystal Chronicle games that are dead to me.

434
00:28:02,602 --> 00:28:03,768
Rym: What about the third one?

435
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,040
Rym: this WiiWare game seems like a good idea.

436
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:10,000
Rym: It has nothing to do with Final Fantasy or even barely Crystal Chronicles.

437
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:14,715
Rym: It's basically as far as I can tell the good part of Actraiser.

438
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,140
Scott: wait, but I like Actraiser.

439
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:18,348
Scott: Ah, well, especially the good part.

440
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:29,120
Rym: Well turns out there are a number of races in the game But you only get to play as one of them unless You buy the other races with Wii shop points.

441
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:30,471
Scott: But doesn't it?

442
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:31,560
Scott: well, it's a WiiWare game.

443
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,929
Scott: So that's a pay we shop points for.

444
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:42,568
Rym: in the first you have to pay for the game But then if you want extra clothes or special things or any of the other races you have to pay more Wii shop points.

445
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,359
Scott: So how much how many points does the game cost?

446
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,446
Scott: 1500 that's $15.

447
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:49,888
Scott: All right How many points to the other races and things cause?

448
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:54,220
Rym: they're going to cost 100 to 300 points to construct homes for them to start.

449
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,977
Scott: So how many races are there total I think for so is it like a hundred points per race.

450
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:00,880
Scott: like you start with one.

451
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,249
Scott: There's four races you pay 300 to get the other three.

452
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:04,353
Scott: I mean theoretically.

453
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:06,100
Rym: All right, the cost isn't so bad.

454
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:08,479
Scott: No, no, here's my is the question though, right?

455
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,628
Scott: Basically, it's not the cost.

456
00:29:11,788 --> 00:29:12,611
Scott: That's a problem.

457
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:14,840
Scott: The problem is the way they structure the cost.

458
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,319
Scott: I mean think about this, right?

459
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,380
Scott: It's basically gonna cost you $18 to get the game with all three races as far as I can tell, right?

460
00:29:23,102 --> 00:29:26,652
Scott: What if they just charge $20 flat for the game with all races?

461
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:30,584
Scott: and didn't you know, like piecemeal it with the micro Transactions, I'm what.

462
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:31,828
Scott: no one would complain.

463
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,638
Scott: No one would complain and they would make more money there.

464
00:29:34,718 --> 00:29:36,720
Rym: This is why I don't think they'll make more money.

465
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,800
Rym: I think this is gonna work really really well because I have very little faith in our fellow gamers.

466
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,562
Scott: What do you know?

467
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:59,700
Rym: No, look if they would have made the game to don't know cuz you're forgetting, you know You know that this is just the test and if people buy those races at all They're gonna sell everything you could imagine little hats little booties little things for these characters special.

468
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:02,800
Scott: They're charging for other things just besides unlocking the race.

469
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:11,155
Rym: I I have a feeling that the races are a test and if people will pay for the races Then they're going to sell you costumes and everything else in the world.

470
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:25,220
Rym: I think that that basically they're getting their foot in the door on the idea of Getting people to buy a game and once they bought into that game Forcing them to buy in with cash as opposed to just with liking.

471
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:27,704
Scott: It's really not cool.

472
00:30:28,165 --> 00:30:29,209
Scott: Yeah, but why?

473
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:31,195
Scott: even I want to buy this game.

474
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:32,780
Scott: Well, what kind of game is it?

475
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,340
Scott: Well, it's a game where you buy stuff with real money and you get fake stuff.

476
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,155
Scott: Yeah, it's a great game.

477
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:45,554
Rym: Yeah I mean this isn't even like World of Warcraft or at least like you go out in the context of the game and you fight And you get it.

478
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,680
Rym: That's like if in World of Warcraft you could go to the old shop and swipe your credit card.

479
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,324
Rym: Well, you can.

480
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,254
Scott: it's just it's sort of you know, not official.

481
00:30:54,314 --> 00:30:55,320
Scott: It's from Chinese.

482
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:57,671
Rym: I'm saying this would be like if it was built into the game.

483
00:30:58,053 --> 00:30:59,420
Rym: What level D character do you want?

484
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,373
Rym: It's five dollars per level swipe.

485
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:04,684
Scott: Yeah Wow, I don't know.

486
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:05,186
Scott: What's what's?

487
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:09,060
Scott: even the point of playing that kind of game is basically it's really not a game at all.

488
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,360
Scott: It's just a psychological trap to get people to give you pay money to change pictures on a screen.

489
00:31:15,721 --> 00:31:23,306
Rym: I'm worried because this could be it could have been a good idea this game because it might be like Actraiser because half of Actraiser Was amazing and half of Actraiser.

490
00:31:23,326 --> 00:31:26,096
Scott: Well, I just paid $15 to play the single race Actraiser.

491
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:28,888
Rym: I Might I got to see the game first.

492
00:31:28,948 --> 00:31:30,435
Rym: I'm only talking about all this meta stuff.

493
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:31,420
Rym: I'm not talking about the game.

494
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:42,508
Rym: Yeah, so yeah as far as I can see They have taken Crystal Chronicles and run it into the ground and as far as I am concerned as fast and as hard as they Possibly could have.

495
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:43,699
Scott: yeah, they made it.

496
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,427
Scott: It was it sword to the top.

497
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:48,380
Scott: then they let it stagnate for a long time and they drove it into the ground.

498
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:49,565
Scott: They really they.

499
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:50,891
Scott: I need some saving graces.

500
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:51,996
Scott: We need like four swords.

501
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:52,880
Scott: We wear or something.

502
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:57,108
Rym: Yeah because I mean Remember Wario aware for the GameCube and how great that was.

503
00:31:57,489 --> 00:32:10,173
Rym: and remember that feeling of disgust when you when you realize that you could Win two-thirds of the minigames in Wario aware for the Wii by just randomly waggling and the rest of the games were just stupid And there was no multiplayer worth a damn.

504
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:11,099
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

505
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:12,739
Scott: They need to pass the wiimote.

506
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,219
Rym: That's like salt on the wound.

507
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:30,760
Rym: But anyway things of the day, so this guy had an idea that is so clever.

508
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,413
Rym: I can't believe I like.

509
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:33,118
Rym: I never thought of it.

510
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:36,379
Rym: But then again, that's why this guy is clever and I am not quite as clever.

511
00:32:37,182 --> 00:32:43,540
Rym: What he did is he made a level in some level editor in Super Mario World really hard level and then he beat it.

512
00:32:44,322 --> 00:32:45,868
Rym: It took him a hundred and thirty four try.

513
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:46,891
Scott: that's a really hard level.

514
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:59,720
Rym: what he then did is superimpose simultaneously all of his attempts in a video and you can watch the video and You really need to see it to understand what this means.

515
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:03,786
Scott: Yeah It's very hard for me to describe it with words But you'll see like a Mario.

516
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:16,271
Rym: that's normal and he blurs a little bit because there's a lot of Mario's there in slight Deviations what the guy did but then it'll get to like a hard part and suddenly that one Mario explodes into a sea of Like 30 Mario's who all die in different ways, but

517
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:18,200
Scott: one of the Mario's like lives

518
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:19,083
Rym: Well by one.

519
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:24,300
Rym: usually it's like the 40 or 50 Mario's from all the different attempts where he made it past that point.

520
00:33:24,488 --> 00:33:26,153
Scott: Yeah But they're all in the same spot.

521
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:33,060
Scott: because you know He basically he played the level like a hundred something times and like 30 of those times he made this jump.

522
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:37,860
Scott: So all the times when he made this jump, you know looks on the screen like one Mario.

523
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,083
Rym: Yep, because remember all these all the old like 2d Mario games were Deterministic.

524
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:53,387
Rym: as in if you figure out the way to beat world 1-1 in Super Mario World or Mario 1 Perfectly you can do it every time like the Koopa will always be in the same spot The timer will always count down at the exact same point.

525
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:57,319
Rym: The Piranha Plant will always appear exactly when you know, it will appear Yep.

526
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:04,460
Scott: So it looks like there's like one Mario and occasionally a whole bunch of other Mario's explode out of it and it's really really interesting.

527
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,850
Scott: I think this is like the best way to demonstrate like levels.

528
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,335
Rym: This is so cool.

529
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,157
Scott: It's really cool.

530
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:10,980
Rym: That's all I got.

531
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,304
Scott: Yeah, all right.

532
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:15,474
Scott: So, you know, this isn't video game related, but I don't give a shit.

533
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:19,404
Rym: Oh, you're not gonna do Sinistar There's a picture.

534
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:22,436
Scott: It's it's not really thinking the name of this for a Photoshop.

535
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:23,399
Rym: I think it is anyway.

536
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:44,860
Scott: See everyone knows that like pictures of food and advertisements are not real like, you know They always talk about how them, you know on the McDonald's commercials the buns have like the seeds glued on And they spritz water on it to make it glow and you're like the bun is just like, you know The burger is just like a piece of fake like clay that's painted to make it look like a really juicy burger.

537
00:34:45,101 --> 00:34:48,800
Scott: And you know, the tomato is like a plastic tomato and you know that all that business.

538
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:52,920
Scott: But you know in general, it's not just like McDonald's.

539
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,420
Scott: It's like every picture of food you ever see on a food package or in an advertisement.

540
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:05,179
Scott: there's basically people whose job it is to photograph food and figure out ways to photograph food and Model food and get it to look really good.

541
00:35:05,441 --> 00:35:14,020
Rym: The worst thing and I've heard about this from multiple sources is if you're an actor and you're in a scene in a film Where there's food that you're eating?

542
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:25,575
Rym: Because the things they do to that food to make it look good on screen do not often make it appetizing No, and also you have to fake eating over and over and over again throughout all the takes.

543
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:31,079
Scott: Yeah, sometimes sometimes It depends on how they film it obvious Sometimes they'll put like a pile of fake food.

544
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:35,999
Scott: But that like they're like that one real drumstick there that you can sort of chew on, you know, something like that.

545
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:40,260
Scott: Anyway, so this guy in Germany had a really smart idea.

546
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:48,711
Scott: he went to the grocery store in Germany and he bought all sorts of products that had pictures of The what was supposedly inside the product.

547
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:56,125
Scott: so a lot of these are like soups where there be a picture of the soup and then he makes the soup and he takes a picture of what the soup actually looks like.

548
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:02,718
Scott: or There'll be some sort of like TV dinner as a picture on the box of what the TV dinner is supposed to look like.

549
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,800
Scott: and Then he actually opens the TV dinner and takes a picture of what's really inside there.

550
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,873
Rym: Let me tell you that Enten Fleisch does not look like whatever Enten Fleisch is.

551
00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:12,980
Scott: The worst one is the herring salad.

552
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:17,491
Scott: The herring salad is like the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.

553
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:20,259
Scott: it looks like a peto bismol with chunks in it.

554
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:21,582
Rym: These are.

555
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:28,120
Rym: the only one that I think really stands out to me is the pistachios because the actual picture looks good.

556
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:36,149
Rym: But the fake pistachios that they put like the picture of the pistachios that they try to sell you the pistachios with Look fake and scary.

557
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:37,093
Rym: They look like aliens.

558
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:37,414
Scott: They do.

559
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:37,977
Scott: it's kind of funny.

560
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,000
Scott: It's like there's a photograph of pistachio nuts and I'm like, huh?

561
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,367
Scott: It looks like pistachio nuts.

562
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:50,677
Scott: and then the you know These computer-generated pistachio nuts that are on the package look like scary like pod people.

563
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:51,780
Scott: pistachio nuts.

564
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:54,765
Scott: But yeah, it's really.

565
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:58,075
Scott: some of these are just sort of like oh that's what I expected.

566
00:36:58,636 --> 00:37:02,453
Scott: some of them are kind of like It's a little bit off but you know, it's still edible.

567
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:05,508
Scott: some of them are like wow I'm nauseous just looking at that.

568
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,436
Scott: and some of them are just like oh, yeah.

569
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:08,440
Scott: Look there's a slight difference.

570
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,880
Scott: I think the thing that's most often seen I think is that in the photographs?

571
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:15,880
Scott: They'll put all sorts of extra stuff.

572
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:22,995
Scott: You know at times you look at like a cereal box and it won't just be like it's like Strawberries and great smiling kids.

573
00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:24,040
Scott: Yeah, you don't see flakes.

574
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:39,675
Scott: You see flakes with milk and fruits and nuts and all kinds of exploding things but in the box is just flakes and a lot of these is like this one that shows rice with all sorts of like Vegetable bits in it all over the place, but really inside is the clumper rice, you know.

575
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:45,560
Scott: or this other one which shows like Like a soup with all sorts of yummy different bits in it.

576
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,980
Scott: But really it's just the soup and the yummy bits are like, you know, you have to add them yourself, you know.

577
00:37:51,041 --> 00:38:01,511
Scott: And yeah This is really something everyone should look at and I think if I had the time and effort I would do repeat this for American food products to compare them to the German.

578
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:04,260
Scott: It's also funny to learn about some German food products.

579
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,831
Rym: Yeah, Germany has a lot of food products that look interesting.

580
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,500
Scott: Yeah, all this rice milk looks really interesting.

581
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,255
Rym: There's a lot of things with like cubed or sliced ham and I really like cubed and sliced ham.

582
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:16,700
Scott: I don't but you know.

583
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:19,786
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so brawl.

584
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:21,652
Scott: so we got to talk about the brawls.

585
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:22,675
Rym: Well, we can't we have.

586
00:38:22,696 --> 00:38:24,060
Rym: we can't avoid talking about it.

587
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,306
Rym: No, you're all gonna keep bothering us.

588
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:25,930
Rym: No we talk about.

589
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,920
Scott: should we talk about like the older smash brothers?

590
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,607
Rym: Also, we can do that a little.

591
00:38:29,627 --> 00:38:31,234
Rym: this would be a real laid-back show.

592
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:31,898
Scott: All right.

593
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:32,340
Scott: All right.

594
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:36,779
Rym: So I think the most pressing question I'm sure people are wondering is who do you play as now?

595
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:38,720
Scott: I don't know.

596
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:43,615
Scott: I basically You know, I mean in the old brawl in the old I keep calling them brawls.

597
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:54,180
Scott: in the older Smash Brothers game I was pretty much all Samus all the time with occasionally using other characters just to get the feel see I never really played the N64 like I played it maybe twice in my entire life.

598
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:06,425
Scott: yeah, it's kind of scary that like I played the n64 one in high school a whole bunch and Then we get to college and rims like oh I never played that and like why the crew had never played Smash Brothers Didn't even know how to play.

599
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:07,731
Rym: I'd never even heard of the game.

600
00:39:08,093 --> 00:39:09,660
Scott: Ah, it was like, ah, what the hell?

601
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,973
Scott: What the hell's going on this.

602
00:39:11,054 --> 00:39:15,674
Rym: I'd heard of it But the thing is I skipped the n64 generation of consoles like Goldeneye, right?

603
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:17,279
Rym: I did but I didn't like it.

604
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,599
Rym: Yeah, cuz I had real FPS.

605
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:22,010
Scott: is Golden eyes great.

606
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,963
Scott: It's not a real FPS But it's great thing.

607
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:27,540
Rym: Goldeneye would have been great if I didn't have a cable modem and real FPS.

608
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:28,505
Scott: It's great.

609
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:29,530
Scott: It's different kind of game.

610
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:32,468
Scott: Just like Smash Brothers is great I mean, it's not a fighting.

611
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:34,706
Scott: it's a guess if you could call it a fighting game But you can't really.

612
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:36,380
Scott: you don't compare it to Soul Calibur.

613
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,047
Scott: It's but it's not the.

614
00:39:38,228 --> 00:39:40,076
Rym: the Goldeneye experience was kind of.

615
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:40,920
Rym: it was like it.

616
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,968
Rym: It was a lot like the Xbox experience.

617
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:49,852
Rym: today with Halo like before those live got really really good But it doesn't hold a candle to like the mega TF.

618
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:52,280
Rym: action quake days has been at least in my eyes.

619
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,680
Scott: Anyway, the point is is that the original Smash Brothers what in its day was a great game and it's still a great game.

620
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,004
Scott: They've just the newer ones.

621
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,770
Scott: They're the same game only better and they.

622
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,816
Rym: why can't Nintendo do this more often?

623
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:07,749
Rym: Alright, here's a game We pretty much hit on the formula right away.

624
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,840
Rym: Let's make moderate improvements over time forever.

625
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:15,172
Scott: Yeah The thing is is other people do that and they get flack from all the game.

626
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,203
Scott: reviewers like you didn't make big enough improvements.

627
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:21,456
Rym: blah blah because Nintendo was good enough already.

628
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:27,960
Rym: but more importantly Nintendo has a level of investment and social currency in their characters.

629
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:30,490
Rym: That defies logic.

630
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:32,880
Scott: I think the other thing about Smash Brothers, right?

631
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,040
Scott: That still is amazing to me is that no one is else has tried to make a game like this.

632
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,239
Scott: I mean there was a Naruto game kind of like this and there was that jump superstars.

633
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:49,720
Scott: There's a little bit like Smash Brothers But not really like Smash Brothers the only game like Smash Brothers and no one else is even stepping into that arena at all.

634
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:51,890
Rym: I thought I saw that someone was doing that.

635
00:40:52,231 --> 00:40:53,296
Scott: actually I didn't see.

636
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:54,100
Rym: I saw some rumor.

637
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,310
Rym: I didn't read the article or something.

638
00:40:55,471 --> 00:40:56,076
Scott: I believe it.

639
00:40:56,116 --> 00:41:02,200
Rym: if I see it I saw it on my blackberry like in the Google Reader while I was eating and I didn't want to try to load the webpage.

640
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,039
Rym: I just skipped it.

641
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,940
Scott: Yeah, but I haven't seen any other games try to step on the into the Smash Brothers toes at all.

642
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:14,667
Rym: It's pretty much the only game that is like it anyway, but yeah in the second in Smash Brothers Melee I like.

643
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:16,160
Rym: that was my first real Smash Brothers.

644
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:22,979
Rym: So I learned how to play and I pretty much ended up playing Falco and peach and I'd alternate between the two.

645
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:28,375
Scott: I was still playing Samus mostly but also, you know other characters randomly kind of.

646
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:33,675
Scott: but in the new one Like I find myself not using Samus so much.

647
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,620
Scott: He's a little slower.

648
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,834
Scott: You know the fact with the switching to the to the zero suit Samus.

649
00:41:38,854 --> 00:41:41,439
Scott: I really don't like the zero suit Samus That's very annoying.

650
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:45,619
Scott: But I kind of I really want to use the final smash if I get it and you kind of have to use it.

651
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:47,867
Scott: So, yeah, I don't know.

652
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:48,750
Rym: I played a lot.

653
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:51,540
Rym: there's some characters I have yet to play like wolf.

654
00:41:51,661 --> 00:41:52,887
Rym: I just didn't even bother with him.

655
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,972
Rym: I didn't even know who he was.

656
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,460
Scott: Yeah, I didn't know who wolf was.

657
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,801
Scott: I didn't.

658
00:41:56,082 --> 00:42:00,379
Scott: I was like when I was trying to I went I got a fact to unlock the characters and it was like wolf.

659
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:01,651
Scott: And I'm like, who the hell is that?

660
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:05,191
Scott: I Didn't play the star foxes that had wolf I guess.

661
00:42:05,753 --> 00:42:11,310
Scott: Ah and Lucas Yeah, well Ness I never liked in the first place.

662
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,936
Scott: cuz his up and B move is no good.

663
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:14,040
Rym: I like his moves a lot.

664
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,025
Rym: It's just difficult.

665
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:19,887
Rym: He's one of those and he's like trying to drive the stupid cappuccino In in the initial the arcade game.

666
00:42:19,927 --> 00:42:22,937
Scott: worse than that worse than that, but people are good with him.

667
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:26,980
Rym: Oh, man Yeah, it's an art to behold kind of like people who are good with ice climbers.

668
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,290
Scott: Yeah, Lucas is just nest but even worse.

669
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:31,420
Rym: No Lucas is like baby mode Ness.

670
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,820
Rym: He's like if you can't handle Ness you can try Lucas, but it's up and B move.

671
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:38,392
Scott: I can't get it to go at all.

672
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:40,060
Scott: I can sometimes get it to go.

673
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:46,600
Rym: My only beef with Lucas is that as a character he's so lame and pathetic and meanwhile Ness is all badass.

674
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:50,313
Rym: Ness reeks of red from the original Pokemon like out you wouldn't believe.

675
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,505
Scott: Yeah, Lucas is totally yellow caviar Yeah, and I never.

676
00:42:53,746 --> 00:42:55,030
Rym: that's when I stopped reading that.

677
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:57,580
Scott: Yeah, let's talk about Smash Brothers in general, right?

678
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:09,560
Scott: So Smash Brothers is sort of like a fighting game But it's sort of not because the only way to win is not to bring the other guys health meter down to zero But to get a ring out and that's the only way to get to get kills, right?

679
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:24,665
Scott: and You basically when you hit other people their percentage goes up and once their percentage gets really high If you hit them with a smash move, they're much more likely to go flying off the screen Much farther.

680
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:31,690
Rym: Yep, and if like some characters can recover better and yeah, so I get hit into a wall You're not gonna fly off no matter how many times you get hit.

681
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,828
Rym: Yeah, there's some special like alright, dude You're at 300% you're gone.

682
00:43:35,868 --> 00:43:38,220
Scott: Yeah, it's like Kirby with his puff puff.

683
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:42,860
Scott: You know flying is a lot harder to get off the screen, you know, cuz you get him really far.

684
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:50,149
Scott: But then he goes puff puff puff puff and he comes right back and it's like, ah, see hit him again And he goes puff puff puff and he comes back again.

685
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,313
Rym: Oh speaking of Kirby.

686
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:53,180
Rym: I got I got to point out something very important.

687
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:58,680
Rym: Mmm, I am like pretty much every gamer in America forever said King today day.

688
00:43:59,081 --> 00:44:01,511
Rym: I've called him King today day my entire life.

689
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:03,620
Scott: I've also called him King today day my entire.

690
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:08,800
Rym: Never met a human being who did not call him King today day or if they did they kept that fact secret.

691
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:21,100
Scott: but in Smash Brothers one one key component of the game is that when you select a character the Narrator says the character's name and this removes all ambiguity as to the correct pronunciation also created.

692
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:25,040
Rym: I'm gonna give you all a little secret from the Smash Brothers brawl.

693
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:28,360
Scott: Well, we're just kind of rambling all about smash all over the place melee.

694
00:44:28,681 --> 00:44:35,679
Rym: So what happens if I choose Pichu but you choose Ness right as I choose Pichu P. Yes, P.

695
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,824
Scott: Yes Yeah, great.

696
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:43,398
Rym: Well, actually he doesn't say the two he goes P. Yes P. Yes, great That was like the best part.

697
00:44:44,442 --> 00:44:47,360
Scott: Yeah, they were sort of rambling all over the place about Smash Brothers.

698
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,814
Scott: I mean like who doesn't already know what there is to know about Smash Brothers?

699
00:44:51,015 --> 00:44:52,039
Scott: King Dedede?

700
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:55,353
Scott: Yeah, King Dedede.

701
00:44:55,514 --> 00:44:56,560
Scott: I guess that's his name.

702
00:44:57,082 --> 00:45:01,437
Rym: I have a lot of trouble saying it but then again how many people had trouble saying the Nintendo Wii?

703
00:45:01,738 --> 00:45:02,782
Rym: and who says Revolution?

704
00:45:02,842 --> 00:45:03,806
Scott: now nobody.

705
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:06,016
Scott: people still say Firefox everyone could.

706
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:07,100
Scott: no one says Phoenix anymore.

707
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:10,371
Rym: I still say capstone and physical plant but none of you care.

708
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:11,094
Scott: That's only good.

709
00:45:11,114 --> 00:45:12,158
Scott: You have to try really hard.

710
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:20,040
Rym: Yeah Especially because when I was there I had to fill out forms to those organizations and it had the bad names on them all the time.

711
00:45:20,242 --> 00:45:23,277
Scott: Yeah, anyway Smash Brothers See you it's a fighting game.

712
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:30,280
Scott: now One thing that makes Smash Brothers better than other fighting games is that you can have more than two people at a time Which is awesome.

713
00:45:30,782 --> 00:45:37,370
Rym: Right you get four friends in there at once and also just the the brilliant Way that the camera kind of zooms in and out and handles.

714
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,815
Rym: this makes it just.

715
00:45:38,915 --> 00:45:40,460
Rym: it's so perfect like they perfected.

716
00:45:40,803 --> 00:45:42,580
Scott: Yeah, I split screen bullshit.

717
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:47,160
Rym: It's four people on the screen at once and it just zooms out to make sure everyone fits at any time.

718
00:45:47,462 --> 00:45:49,799
Rym: If it comes down to two people fighting it zooms way in.

719
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:50,804
Scott: well I think part of it.

720
00:45:50,984 --> 00:45:56,300
Scott: the excellent camera also works with the function of the game Which is knock someone off the screen.

721
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,700
Scott: So, you know the camera doesn't have to go follow you if you go off the screen because you're dying out there.

722
00:46:02,021 --> 00:46:06,980
Scott: But you know, it has a little arrow telling you where you went to so you can still try to make your way back.

723
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,930
Scott: You know if you have that ability, but I play metatight.

724
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:11,391
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:46:11,411 --> 00:46:12,354
Scott: All right.

726
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:14,700
Rym: I just wanted to get a non sequitur right in there.

727
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,403
Scott: Yeah, it's great.

728
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:17,130
Scott: The other thing about Smash Bros.

729
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:17,873
Scott: I think is great.

730
00:46:17,974 --> 00:46:19,420
Scott: Is that unlike some other fighting?

731
00:46:20,102 --> 00:46:21,145
Rym: Such an objective review.

732
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:22,389
Rym: I just imagine it's like.

733
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,096
Rym: and another thing that's great about Smash Brothers.

734
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:25,518
Rym: Yeah.

735
00:46:25,638 --> 00:46:31,035
Scott: All right You know even Soul Calibur 2 the greatest normal fighting game.

736
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:32,159
Scott: That's 3d, right?

737
00:46:33,261 --> 00:46:36,691
Scott: You pick any one character and they have like a zillion moves.

738
00:46:37,112 --> 00:46:48,800
Scott: and while the basic moves are pretty intuitive You know, every character has you know, some complicated moves that require Sequences of button presses or combinations of button presses and they're not the same for every character.

739
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,831
Rym: You have to learn them and don't forget stances and all that crazy.

740
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:54,520
Rym: I mean, yeah, I played nothing but Voldo forever.

741
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:58,600
Rym: I'm the Voldo man and yet I don't know all of his moves to this day.

742
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,584
Scott: I have played nothing.

743
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:07,720
Scott: but you know Siegfried nightmare pretty much, you know, I've played the other characters But Siegfried's nightmare has been my man since the original soul edge course.

744
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,259
Rym: I think Scott and I are both working the kinds of people or the kinds of gamers who?

745
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:18,000
Rym: Whenever there's a game where you choose like a character to be like you have a choice to be a character.

746
00:47:18,362 --> 00:47:21,440
Rym: Whether or not it matters like what the characters powers are.

747
00:47:22,102 --> 00:47:25,754
Rym: We tend to one be very loyal to like one character and choose a character.

748
00:47:25,774 --> 00:47:27,480
Scott: We like based on other things.

749
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,415
Rym: Yes, I choose my character based solely on how cool I think that character is.

750
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:32,559
Scott: You think all those really cool?

751
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,260
Rym: Well, here's the weird thing.

752
00:47:34,321 --> 00:47:35,200
Scott: Well, there's the exception.

753
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:41,800
Rym: The reason I played Voldo is because Voldo was really intuitive to me for some reason like the way he moves.

754
00:47:42,282 --> 00:47:44,371
Rym: I don't know what it was, but I like.

755
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:46,580
Rym: I'd never played like Soul Calibur one that much.

756
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,449
Rym: I never really liked all the old Soul Calipers cuz.

757
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:51,662
Rym: I was more of a Bushido blade kid Terrible.

758
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:52,829
Rym: Bushido blade is great.

759
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,559
Rym: You can all die in a fire sucks.

760
00:47:55,282 --> 00:47:58,613
Rym: But so I played Soul Calibur.

761
00:47:58,673 --> 00:48:08,291
Scott: just to clarify before people come at me I like the idea of Bushido blade which is you know, oh man, you hit a guy with the sword He actually gets hurt real semi realistically and dies.

762
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:11,685
Scott: the actual execution of Bushido blade I think is not it doesn't?

763
00:48:11,705 --> 00:48:13,112
Rym: you played Bushido blade three.

764
00:48:13,132 --> 00:48:14,580
Scott: I played Bushido blade one and two.

765
00:48:14,802 --> 00:48:15,954
Rym: Yeah, you should have played three.

766
00:48:15,974 --> 00:48:16,460
Rym: It's better.

767
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:21,160
Scott: It might be but the actual execution of one and two is not make for the greatest game.

768
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,895
Rym: Well, if any of you out there try to argue that Bushido blade one was better.

769
00:48:23,976 --> 00:48:29,779
Rym: No, you're wrong but For some reason like I played I was like, ooh, I'll be sick for you.

770
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:31,668
Rym: Yeah whatever and I play it as everyone.

771
00:48:31,688 --> 00:48:38,540
Rym: and then I played as Voldo and I won and I won and I won and I won and it was kind of creepy and everyone's like ring.

772
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,366
Rym: Why are you playing Voldo?

773
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:43,056
Rym: Like I don't know and it became my thing.

774
00:48:43,077 --> 00:48:50,159
Rym: and While I probably would have liked to be I don't know Rafael I feel like that's the character I would have picked if I had been picking.

775
00:48:50,785 --> 00:48:55,288
Rym: Voldo chose me More due to the reputation of people going.

776
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:56,914
Rym: Oh god Rym plays Voldo.

777
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,239
Rym: It's very fun.

778
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:05,400
Scott: Yeah, plus, you know and I don't even know like a quarter of the moves of Siegfried slash nightmare, but I win a lot.

779
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:07,046
Scott: I mean, I'm not great.

780
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:11,565
Scott: Like if I play in a tournament, I'll get my ass kicked but against in casual play I win a lot.

781
00:49:11,626 --> 00:49:13,600
Scott: Here's another thing annoying giant sword.

782
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:16,186
Rym: I'm definitely comparing apples to oranges a little bit.

783
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:24,411
Rym: but the all games all game not just fighting games video games every possible game that could ever exist.

784
00:49:24,752 --> 00:49:35,593
Rym: there are like limits and ceilings and there's a point in which you were playing the game the best the game could possibly be played within the limitations of the game itself or in the context of the game.

785
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:39,007
Rym: and The thing about Smash Brothers.

786
00:49:39,147 --> 00:49:42,960
Rym: and a lot of people don't really realize this except the people who are really good at the game.

787
00:49:43,742 --> 00:49:56,205
Rym: the ceiling for goodness in Smash Brothers all the Smash Brothers games is Crazy high like to the point that most people who play that game will never even get close to the full potential of any of the Characters.

788
00:49:56,689 --> 00:50:08,040
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically the thing I was gonna say before that I was trying to get to is that Smash Brothers unlike all the other fighting games or Typical fighting games is that every character has the same moves?

789
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,451
Scott: You don't to learn new controls for each character.

790
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,300
Scott: Everyone is the same set of moves.

791
00:50:12,602 --> 00:50:15,700
Scott: You know B is special moves a is normal moves.

792
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:16,202
Scott: You know.

793
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:21,260
Scott: a and up is you know an upward attack a in the side is a sideways attack.

794
00:50:21,862 --> 00:50:30,295
Scott: A and tap to the side is a smash a and tap to the up as a smash Etc right B and up is usually some sort of recovery move, you know.

795
00:50:30,415 --> 00:50:41,140
Scott: or upward special move Always like the weird move Yeah, just be on its own is sort of the normal special move like shoot a fireball princess peaches butt smash like my favorite thing.

796
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:41,957
Scott: It's a pretty good one.

797
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:46,235
Scott: But the depending on what character you choose those moves are gonna be different.

798
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:48,769
Scott: the damage is gonna be different Their speed is different.

799
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:57,720
Scott: Their size is different Their jumping is different, you know, and that's that's what makes Smash Brothers great Is that you don't have to relearn the game to change characters?

800
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,997
Scott: Which is why people play different characters a lot more than they do than in other fighting games and it.

801
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:09,540
Scott: it makes it a lot More fun and gives you a lot more replay value because it's easy to switch it up But you still to be good with the character you sort of have to learn.

802
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:13,718
Scott: You know how to use all their moves effectively and yep now actually what we'll get to this.

803
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:20,696
Rym: but pretty much the the factors that matter the most unlike other games were knowing all the moves and memorization.

804
00:51:20,716 --> 00:51:21,939
Rym: a lot of things count for a lot.

805
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:25,980
Rym: in Smash Brothers it pretty much comes down to timing.

806
00:51:26,522 --> 00:51:32,860
Rym: Knowing the timing of smashes the timing of attacks and precision control with the character you are using and that's it.

807
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,387
Rym: That's all the timing and rapid reflexes.

808
00:51:35,808 --> 00:51:41,965
Scott: and knowing the timing of various moves and the effectiveness of various moves is Really the key to winning.

809
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:47,062
Rym: and the level of precision you need to be very good at that game is a lot more than you Might think.

810
00:51:47,122 --> 00:51:52,299
Scott: yeah, the thing about Smash Brothers is this right people always go all games on balance blah blah blah.

811
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,817
Scott: This character is better than that characters, but it's unfair blah That's all bullshit.

812
00:51:56,837 --> 00:52:08,874
Scott: now I'm not gonna say that all the characters are exactly equal because in order to say that I would have to perfectly be the grand Master of the game and a hundred percent with everything, but eventually we will find out.

813
00:52:09,436 --> 00:52:10,339
Scott: eventually we'll find out.

814
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:15,027
Scott: but basically the thing about the game is that some Characters are harder to use.

815
00:52:15,067 --> 00:52:18,540
Scott: like it is harder to play as ice climbers than it is to play as Mario.

816
00:52:19,122 --> 00:52:27,069
Scott: If you have two people of equal skill right and none of them are particularly skilled with any character They just have the same general Smash Brothers knowledge.

817
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:30,380
Scott: and one guy chooses Mario and one guy chooses ice climber.

818
00:52:30,842 --> 00:52:32,651
Scott: I'm probably gonna bet on the Mario guy.

819
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:39,560
Scott: if there's a third guy who's Pikachu I'm probably gonna bet on him, you know, but it's just because ice climber is harder to use.

820
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:47,300
Scott: So someone at skill level 10 playing ice climber might only be like at a power level of a hundred.

821
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:58,540
Scott: But someone at skill level 10 with Mario might be a power level You know, but meanwhile, what if someone is the master of Smash Brothers?

822
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,771
Scott: Well, maybe someone who's the grand master of Smash Brothers.

823
00:53:02,072 --> 00:53:14,100
Scott: if they play with Mario the power level might be 10,000 but if they play with ice climbers the power level might be 100,000. because the ice climber because they can draw out the hidden power of the ice climbers with their skill.

824
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:32,380
Scott: and I think really the winning at Smash Brothers comes down to skill the Luck because there is a lot of luck in the game unless you do the Fox no items final destination The the exact combination of characters and map that has been selected.

825
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:39,264
Scott: I know if there's a big map and one guy is a fast character with ranged attacks and one guy is a slow character with Close-up attacks.

826
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:43,260
Scott: It's gonna be really hard for the slow character to win on a big map.

827
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,393
Rym: Yes, but at the same time much like with Texas Hold'em and you know games like that I mean you can win it's if you're really good.

828
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:53,436
Scott: if someone was really good They probably even beat me in that kind of situation over time.

829
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:56,689
Rym: in aggregate The better players will win a higher percentage of the game.

830
00:53:56,749 --> 00:54:05,220
Scott: Yep, which is why I think if there's a Smash Brothers tournament I would always have random characters and random maps and I would just have a losers bracket to account for the randomness.

831
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:08,410
Rym: If I didn't do randomness, I would just do a triple elimination.

832
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,720
Rym: The problem is that requires a ludicrous amount of planning.

833
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:14,400
Scott: No, I could just do a round robin where everyone sort of plays.

834
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:18,138
Scott: You know everyone and then you see who had got the most wins and then those people do.

835
00:54:18,218 --> 00:54:20,078
Scott: is you know You have a you do that kind of method.

836
00:54:20,742 --> 00:54:24,620
Scott: Actually, this this newest Smash Brothers is a built-in tournament mode, which I we have to try out.

837
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,666
Rym: Yeah, we haven't tried that yet.

838
00:54:25,686 --> 00:54:28,260
Rym: We're not reviewing the game so much cuz what it's Smash Brothers.

839
00:54:28,542 --> 00:54:29,306
Scott: Yeah, I mean, come on.

840
00:54:29,326 --> 00:54:30,050
Scott: What else you gonna say about?

841
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,880
Scott: All right, here's what we got to say with the new Smash Brothers.

842
00:54:32,323 --> 00:54:33,953
Scott: There's a lot more characters.

843
00:54:34,013 --> 00:54:34,959
Scott: They're really cool.

844
00:54:35,381 --> 00:54:36,264
Rym: I like met a knight.

845
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:40,560
Scott: the subspace emissary sucks, but so not worth playing.

846
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,100
Scott: It's not worth playing but it's the easiest way to unlock the characters in the map.

847
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,963
Scott: It's not worth it.

848
00:54:45,003 --> 00:54:46,167
Rym: It's just a stupid grind.

849
00:54:46,589 --> 00:54:49,600
Scott: Yeah, but to unlock the characters the maps any other way is even worse.

850
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:50,544
Rym: Just keep playing.

851
00:54:50,966 --> 00:54:55,064
Scott: just basically go online and figure out the minimum work You have to do to unlock.

852
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:59,720
Scott: you only want to unlock the characters and the maps are multiplayer everything else.

853
00:55:00,021 --> 00:55:00,704
Scott: Don't give a shit.

854
00:55:00,745 --> 00:55:04,120
Scott: trophies who gives a shit, you know stickers who gives a shit?

855
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:11,131
Scott: Just ignore all that bullshit because all you really care about is the multiplayer action and to make that All you need are the maps and the character.

856
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:12,760
Rym: You might want the stuff for the map editor.

857
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:17,558
Scott: Yeah, the map editor, you know people are putting it down, but I'm in a map that looks like a penis.

858
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:26,553
Rym: So I Was gonna bring that up to make fun of you, but now that you brought it up I got nothing so that validates the worthiness of the map editor right away.

859
00:55:26,934 --> 00:55:27,897
Scott: the online play.

860
00:55:28,118 --> 00:55:28,780
Scott: who gives a shit?

861
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,045
Scott: It's all about the local play.

862
00:55:30,266 --> 00:55:33,860
Scott: the online play is just not worth it because you know, it's just you might as well.

863
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,970
Scott: It's no different than playing against the CPU.

864
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:38,979
Scott: Well, except that I can't talk to the baby You don't know who they are.

865
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,549
Rym: Maybe just because I'm better at Smash Brothers than I used to be.

866
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:50,049
Rym: but I was practicing over the previous weekend and I got to the point where pretty much the AI Cannot win even on the hardest AI setting.

867
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:51,494
Rym: the AI is so stupid.

868
00:55:51,694 --> 00:55:52,778
Scott: play three against one.

869
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:53,400
Scott: you verse three.

870
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:54,567
Scott: I want a team against you.

871
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:55,492
Rym: I didn't do that yet.

872
00:55:55,633 --> 00:55:56,659
Scott: That's how to get really good.

873
00:55:56,888 --> 00:56:06,375
Rym: Yeah pretty much I played a lot of one verse one until I could never lose and then I played a lot of to like to Verse one and a lot of for free-for-all.

874
00:56:06,616 --> 00:56:07,420
Rym: see I never lost.

875
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:12,580
Scott: Yeah, you got to do three versus one where it's three computers all attacking you and only you and not each other.

876
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:14,126
Rym: Actually, I just got to play against humans.

877
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:17,742
Rym: that too because there are a lot of cheap ways to kill the AI Cuz.

878
00:56:17,902 --> 00:56:21,880
Rym: it'll get confused and you can just knock it off the edge and kind of hold it off the edge until it dies.

879
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:27,180
Scott: The thing is playing against humans You need to find in order to get the higher level of skill like to be a master.

880
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:31,880
Scott: You need to play against people who are masters like that and they're not easy to come by if you keep playing with just your.

881
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:38,280
Rym: That's why I'm gonna go to uh, I know some people some peeps back at our ITs and we go out there for torque on.

882
00:56:38,742 --> 00:56:41,913
Rym: I'm gonna be hitting up some Conrad for some Smash Brothers brawl.

883
00:56:41,993 --> 00:56:43,700
Rym: Yeah, cuz I know that he is better than me.

884
00:56:43,961 --> 00:56:44,242
Scott: Let's see.

885
00:56:44,263 --> 00:56:45,510
Scott: What else is different in this one.

886
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,360
Scott: They changed the the home run thing.

887
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,714
Scott: I think they made it a little better a little more interesting.

888
00:56:49,755 --> 00:56:50,519
Rym: It's a lot more fun.

889
00:56:50,746 --> 00:56:51,828
Rym: Yeah I like how.

890
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:57,938
Rym: it's not just Wow be Yoshi and kick it a whole bunch with the stupid downward kick and everyone else just kind of sucks.

891
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:00,685
Scott: Yep See what else did they do?

892
00:57:01,207 --> 00:57:03,436
Scott: there's this tournament mode.

893
00:57:03,456 --> 00:57:04,480
Rym: we talked about that.

894
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,460
Scott: I know I'm trying to think assist trophies are hilarious.

895
00:57:07,581 --> 00:57:10,760
Scott: This is trophies are pretty good, but it's not worth it to try and unlock.

896
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,307
Scott: I like how the hammer get unlocked.

897
00:57:12,327 --> 00:57:15,380
Rym: the hammer is so much gimpier that used to be but now there's the golden hammer.

898
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,706
Rym: That is just amazing and cool.

899
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:17,008
Rym: Yeah.

900
00:57:17,108 --> 00:57:17,772
Scott: Oh, there's the final.

901
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:19,440
Scott: All right, we gotta talk about the final smash, right?

902
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,008
Rym: I like this final smash a lot.

903
00:57:21,028 --> 00:57:23,120
Scott: There's the final smash and there's that other thing.

904
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,979
Scott: I forget what it's called the the thing from Kirby the three-piece item.

905
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:38,369
Scott: Basically the final smash is this you'll be playing and there's an item called the final smash or the smash ball right and basically this ball will float onto the screen and Everyone will try to beat up the ball.

906
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:44,283
Scott: like normally when there's an item you pick it up and then you use it But the smash ball you have to beat it up So you'll just.

907
00:57:44,343 --> 00:57:47,658
Scott: it usually floats so usually means you have to jump up there and hit it.

908
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:51,317
Scott: now You have to do more a lot of damage to it because you want it.

909
00:57:51,397 --> 00:57:53,649
Scott: basically Hitting it doesn't help you.

910
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:55,900
Scott: you want to be the person who breaks it.

911
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,283
Scott: So if Rym hits it a whole bunch and then I tap it and it breaks It's it.

912
00:58:00,384 --> 00:58:02,351
Scott: Rym might as well not a hit it because I got.

913
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:06,715
Rym: yet if Scott doesn't use his smash in time I can knock it out of him and then I can hit it.

914
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,239
Scott: That's true.

915
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:17,537
Scott: But anyway, when you if you're the person who does the final, you know straw that breaks the smash ball You glow and you have the super smash like mega final smash power.

916
00:58:17,658 --> 00:58:18,260
Rym: They're all different.

917
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,265
Rym: We're not gonna get into that.

918
00:58:19,325 --> 00:58:22,139
Scott: like all the different every character has a different final smash.

919
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:27,293
Scott: Basically what it amounts to is you push B and then you're probably gonna kill somebody.

920
00:58:27,353 --> 00:58:36,520
Scott: but depending on your character it ranges from Instantly kill everyone in the screen pretty much guaranteed to kill someone guaranteed with a lot of skill.

921
00:58:36,782 --> 00:58:43,333
Scott: yeah, like super Wario or Supersonic it's actually kind of hard to kill what supersonic is one of the best ones.

922
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,597
Scott: super Wario is a little harder.

923
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:46,676
Rym: supersonic is Okay, but it's never killed me.

924
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:58,600
Scott: Yeah, well supersonic, you know Basically, it's just he starts flying around the screen and you had to control it to really pull on the stick to keep him On the screen, but you just sort of run into people and they get really hurt a lot.

925
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,769
Rym: I like meta nights is pretty much if you pull it off.

926
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:02,416
Rym: Somebody's gonna get hurt.

927
00:59:02,517 --> 00:59:07,153
Scott: real bad Yeah, but like super Wario you have to fly around the screen.

928
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:08,979
Scott: It's a little easier than flying supersonic.

929
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:14,140
Scott: You actually have to beat people up by pushing a and such and it's much harder to actually kill people that somebody.

930
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:22,380
Scott: Yeah, and I think what this the smash ball does is it's sort of it really Does something interesting to the game?

931
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:33,300
Scott: It makes a little bit more random because you know a character who is more Able to go around the map say Pikachu versus Donkey Kong is probably gonna be able to get the final smash more often.

932
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:33,681
Scott: But at

933
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:34,484
Rym: the same time

934
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:35,569
Scott: onto the map a lot

935
00:59:35,749 --> 00:59:47,759
Rym: enough of them come down the balls coming off to her in Aggregate, you know people are gonna get him and it evens out in the end and everyone's smash power is kind of balanced with all the other powers of their character and their likelihood of getting the ball.

936
00:59:47,779 --> 01:00:06,977
Rym: and it also Serves this interesting purpose of if there's a stalemate which really only happens among really crappy inexperienced players or just even in a real head-up game like the games going and suddenly it appears and Let me tell you the tension when there's four people surrounding that thing try and desperately to get it.

937
01:00:06,997 --> 01:00:09,359
Rym: Ah That adds so much.

938
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:15,680
Scott: Yeah, I mean because you know a lot of times you'd be playing this game and inexperienced kind of players would you know?

939
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:20,180
Scott: Just like sit there from far away shooting each other like Fox will start shooting his laser at someone.

940
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:27,520
Scott: They'd be really timid and standoffish Especially when it was coming down to like, you know, the last life people would be really cowardly on a big map.

941
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:32,260
Scott: They would keep running away and only attacking when they had a big advantage like a hammer or something.

942
01:00:32,602 --> 01:00:42,098
Scott: And then when someone else had a hammer you just run away, you know When his ball comes onto the screen suddenly it's like wow if I get that ball is a good chance I'm just gonna kill the guy.

943
01:00:42,481 --> 01:00:50,856
Scott: So everyone goes for the ball and you really you're just sort of forced to either Fight for it or not and it really it sort of forces everyone to play.

944
01:00:50,876 --> 01:01:02,260
Scott: It's like yeah Okay, if you want to be a Rym would often have that strategy because in stock games and the old Smash Brothers I'd be Falco and I'd or Pikachu and I'd hide in the top right corner.

945
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:07,620
Scott: Yeah, every now and then because you play we play stock instead of time which is a game of survival.

946
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:10,200
Scott: It's who lives to the end not who gets the most kills.

947
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:16,703
Scott: So Rym would just run away and avoid getting hit as much as he could and hopefully at the end He would be.

948
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:20,180
Scott: you know of more lives than the other guy and I have like one more life.

949
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,213
Rym: So I just grab him and jump off the edge or something.

950
01:01:22,314 --> 01:01:23,159
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

951
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:28,498
Scott: So this when the smash ball comes that's sort of like oh shit You can't just run and hide.

952
01:01:28,558 --> 01:01:32,933
Scott: now You actually have to get in the fight or someone's just gonna kill you instantly.

953
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:37,188
Scott: no matter with this giant item pretty much The other item they added is like this.

954
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:38,434
Scott: I think it comes from Kirby.

955
01:01:38,474 --> 01:01:39,780
Scott: I'm not exactly sure what it's called.

956
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:41,400
Scott: It's three pieces, right?

957
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:51,100
Scott: And if you get one of the pieces you said an icon appears that shows that you have one of the pieces Which is great because then you'll have situation where someone says oh crap room has two of them.

958
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:51,986
Rym: Don't let me get the third one.

959
01:01:52,006 --> 01:01:52,409
Rym: Oh my god.

960
01:01:52,449 --> 01:01:52,711
Rym: Let's go.

961
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:53,114
Rym: Fuck him.

962
01:01:53,356 --> 01:02:01,520
Scott: Yeah, and If you get all three pieces You sort of zoom out and you have this target and you can shoot someone on the screen with it and then kill them.

963
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:03,819
Rym: It's difficult but not impossible to dodge.

964
01:02:04,462 --> 01:02:08,136
Scott: Yeah, it's difficult and it pretty much if it hits it's an instant kill.

965
01:02:08,176 --> 01:02:09,120
Scott: Nothing you could do about it.

966
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:21,900
Scott: I've seen people kill all three people with this item and basically when these pieces of this item start appearing because they always appear as a set like You know if one appears the rest of them are gonna appear pretty soon if they're not already.

967
01:02:22,502 --> 01:02:27,100
Scott: So it forces everyone to go in and start fighting over the three pieces because you're only other choices.

968
01:02:27,563 --> 01:02:29,939
Scott: The other guy would just pick up all three pieces and kill you.

969
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:38,018
Rym: now Of course the some of the greatest fun occurs When there's a golden hammer somewhere on the map and those pieces and then a ball appears.

970
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:41,019
Scott: generally You'd grab the hammer smash the ball.

971
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:42,103
Scott: Yet get.

972
01:02:42,304 --> 01:02:43,668
Scott: use the hammer to clear everyone out.

973
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:47,299
Scott: get all three pieces kill someone then push B and kill everyone else.

974
01:02:48,542 --> 01:02:50,210
Scott: Or just lose or just lose.

975
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:52,160
Scott: be one of those other guys who doesn't get all the pieces.

976
01:02:52,782 --> 01:02:54,469
Rym: But yeah, I don't think we need to say much more.

977
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,096
Rym: Smash Brothers is Smash Brothers.

978
01:02:56,418 --> 01:02:56,920
Rym: It's great.

979
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,946
Rym: Yeah, I'm rather enjoying it that.

980
01:02:59,227 --> 01:03:02,177
Scott: the only negative comment I can make about this new Smash Brothers.

981
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:14,376
Scott: Is that Unlike previous Smash Brothers, which were sort of like in you know A hundred percent intuitive pick up and play like it wasn't a hundred percent intuitive Like you'll know all the moves and be good but it's a hundred percent intuitive in.

982
01:03:14,577 --> 01:03:16,407
Scott: you'll know You know what to do.

983
01:03:16,447 --> 01:03:17,433
Scott: there won't be any secrets.

984
01:03:17,996 --> 01:03:20,688
Scott: this new one It requires some knowledge.

985
01:03:20,749 --> 01:03:25,468
Scott: Like if you don't know what the Smash Ball does You're then the other person does.

986
01:03:25,488 --> 01:03:34,579
Scott: then suddenly the game is not working out so well, really Yeah, or if you don't know that those items are important and someone else does Yeah, the game doesn't work.

987
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,784
Scott: So the game.

988
01:03:35,804 --> 01:03:48,560
Scott: I think the one bit the biggest negative about it besides the crappy subspace emissary mode Is that it requires some prerequisite knowledge for all players or the game is somewhat broken in a way.

989
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,968
Rym: Luckily that definitely does I mean.

990
01:03:52,048 --> 01:03:54,597
Rym: by doing this it kind of caters to the people like the hardcore.

991
01:03:54,617 --> 01:03:58,779
Rym: people are really into this sort of thing and It's not like it's insurmountable.

992
01:03:59,222 --> 01:04:00,369
Rym: Hey hit that thing.

993
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:03,565
Scott: people learned it in about like, you know A handful of games.

994
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:06,597
Scott: people who came over learned what all the things do mostly because we told them.

995
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:08,584
Scott: I could have kept it a Longer.

996
01:04:08,604 --> 01:04:10,420
Rym: I think they would have figured they want to figure it out.

997
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,339
Scott: They were starting to figure it out, which is why I told them.

998
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:15,880
Rym: Well, I think on that note we should stop because I kind of want to play some brawl.

999
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,238
Scott: Yeah, maybe but yeah everyone if you have a Wii, how could you not have Smash Brothers?

1000
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:22,945
Rym: if you have a Wii You already have it.

1001
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:23,267
Rym: That's just.

1002
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:26,040
Scott: I'm assuming that yeah, so why do we even need to like review this?

1003
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,074
Scott: I mean, is it worth it to buy a Wii to get Smash Brothers?

1004
01:04:29,114 --> 01:04:30,039
Scott: Well, probably not.

1005
01:04:30,781 --> 01:04:38,076
Scott: Not that if you're not on its own But if you wanted some other Wii games to Smash Brothers definitely makes the Wii a better buy.

1006
01:04:38,156 --> 01:04:39,300
Rym: if you can find one.

1007
01:04:39,741 --> 01:04:44,064
Scott: Yeah, if you haven't, you know, maybe you don't have a Wii or it's hard to get a Wii I don't know.

1008
01:04:44,406 --> 01:04:49,675
Scott: But if you haven't played the older Smash Brothers It's worth it to play the n64 and GameCube ones.

1009
01:04:49,896 --> 01:04:55,280
Rym: but be warned Just know if you play this game at home or with your friends.

1010
01:04:55,561 --> 01:04:56,263
Rym: That's one thing.

1011
01:04:56,725 --> 01:05:04,652
Rym: if you go to a convention and play it in any sort of tournament or just play it at a convention Be prepared to find out that you are not good at that game at all.

1012
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:07,460
Scott: Yeah, there's like a whole nother level of play.

1013
01:05:07,582 --> 01:05:18,079
Rym: That's sort of like well like four tiers of goodness and Scott and I are barely at the second tier and the third tier is like Able to play at a convention without people laughing at you.

1014
01:05:18,401 --> 01:05:21,714
Scott: Yeah, the fourth tier is like winning trophies all around the world.

1015
01:05:21,915 --> 01:05:23,220
Scott: I can you know tournaments.

1016
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:23,969
Rym: Yeah Think about that.

1017
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:30,700
Rym: tier three Not get made fun of when you play not even win just not lose so badly that you get made fun of.

1018
01:05:31,162 --> 01:05:32,487
Scott: Well, I don't think I would get made fun of.

1019
01:05:32,548 --> 01:05:40,667
Scott: but I mean if I played in a tournament with real players at this Game, like I would probably just be like dead dead, you know holding my own a little bit dead like

1020
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,475

1043
01:07:49,606 --> 01:08:02,470
Scott: I Was barely 17 and I once killed a boy with a fender.

1044
01:08:02,854 --> 01:08:13,308
Scott: I Don't remember if it was a telecaster or a Stratocaster But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome and a voice like a horny angel.

1045
01:08:15,469 --> 01:08:21,549
Scott: I Don't remember if it was a telecaster or a Stratocaster, but I do remember that it wasn't at all easy.

1046
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:29,470
Scott: It required the perfect combination of the right power cords and the precise angle from which to strike.

1047
01:08:31,332 --> 01:08:40,069
Rym: The guitar bled for about a week afterward and the blood was zoo dark and rich like wild berries.

1048
01:08:41,392 --> 01:08:44,689
Scott: The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red.

1049
01:08:45,852 --> 01:08:57,770
Scott: The guitar bled for about a week afterward, but it rung out Beautifully and I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before.

1050
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:05,966
Rym: So I Took my guitar and I smashed it against the wall.

1051

1052
01:09:08,261 --> 01:09:17,200
Rym: I Smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader Smashed it against the hood of a car Smashed it against the 1981 Harley Davidson.

1053
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:26,490
Scott: the Harley howled in pain the guitar And I ran up the stairs to my parents bedroom.

1054
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:31,609
Scott: Mommy and daddy was sleeping in the moonlight.

1055
01:09:33,053 --> 01:09:38,288

1056
01:09:39,233 --> 01:09:46,819
Scott: I raised the guitar high above my head and just as I was about to bring the guitar Crashing down upon the center of the bed.
