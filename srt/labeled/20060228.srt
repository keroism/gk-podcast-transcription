1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,651
Scott: It's Tuesday February 28th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:17,080
Scott: We talk about the penny arcade collectible card game.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,263
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:20,146
Scott: All right.

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:30,477
Scott: So yesterday I talked about list all and a few of the things I said were either Slightly incorrect or they changed overnight literally.

6
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:37,020
Rym: now I have a quote from Scott that he said this on the show a couple weeks ago.

7
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,313
Rym: I could play it if you really wanted.

8
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:42,480
Rym: I have to dig it up But I believe the words were I am infallible.

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,690
Rym: Perhaps are you indeed infallible Scott?

10
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:49,360
Scott: if I said it I guess yeah.

11
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,999
Rym: But you said now that you were a little bit incorrect about some things.

12
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:55,868
Scott: Well, no, it wasn't incorrect.

13
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,838
Scott: It was incomplete as in there was either things I didn't know or things which changed since then to now because list all changes.

14
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:04,772
Rym: so bad Alright, so what's up?

15
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:08,348
Scott: So literally Remember I said you couldn't add anything manually.

16
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,351
Rym: now you can.

17
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:09,953
Scott: now you can.

18
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,160
Scott: you can just go and type in a video game.

19
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:20,012
Scott: so NES games ahoy and The second thing they added a new tab the movies tab.

20
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:34,469
Scott: So now any movie that's an IMDB somewhere You can say I've watched it or I want to watch it or neither one of those, you know, and then you can rate them and Review them and all that.

21
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,624
Rym: so yeah Well, if it weren't the fact that I'm already using IMDB for that Netflix you mean?

22
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:42,169
Rym: Oh, yeah, well Netflix.

23
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,197
Rym: I use the IMDB to find out if a movie's good.

24
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,798
Scott: Yeah The thing is is that until they implement the sort of?

25
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:56,120
Scott: Automatic suggesting thing it's really hard to remember every movie you've seen and go through and try to find them all.

26
00:01:56,563 --> 00:02:00,562
Scott: So it's the data entry is really painful for that And I really think they should.

27
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,946
Scott: just why a movie and DVDs separate?

28
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:11,417
Scott: there really should be just video of all of all sorts including TV and everything and VHS and movie theater and everything.

29
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:16,238
Scott: then Text of all sorts comic books regular books everything.

30
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:20,400
Scott: Then games of all sorts board games video games.

31
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:25,840
Rym: Well, I think that just goes way beyond what the guy you did list all originally expected to do.

32
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,149
Scott: I know but he it's called list all.

33
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:29,373
Scott: he's got a list at all.

34
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:30,377
Rym: It's not called list all.

35
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,662
Rym: it's called list Al.

36
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:35,757
Rym: yeah, if it was if it's list all you get some spammer websites.

37
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:36,640
Rym: Like I said yesterday.

38
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:43,191
Scott: Yeah, well you see the thing is the reason is called list all is because eventually when he adds everything then you'll add the other L.

39
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:46,007
Rym: Yeah, but I mean for now you.

40
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:47,291
Rym: so you can type your own thing in.

41
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:54,669
Rym: right if I type something in one way and someone Else types it in another way Yeah, but there are certain things that sort of prevent that.

42
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,421
Scott: like you don't have to you only have to type in the name of Something.

43
00:02:59,063 --> 00:02:59,966
Scott: but here's an example.

44
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:01,170
Scott: I typed in.

45
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:14,038
Scott: I was tagging all my books today, right because I was bored yeah, so I tagged some books as Dark horse because they're published by dark horse, whatever I Typed in dark horse.

46
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:22,250
Scott: It found other people using the dark horse tag and it modified my dark horse tag to match their dark horse tag Really?

47
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:27,963
Scott: Yep So if you typed in a game name like close to another game It would be like.

48
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:28,968
Scott: is it any of these?

49
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:31,140
Scott: and there are certain like ID numbers?

50
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,108
Scott: They'll ask you to type like.

51
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:42,307
Scott: if you type in the UPC It'll see if there's already UPC matching that in the database somewhere and then it'll just give you that one instead of You know, huh letting you make your own.

52
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:44,413
Rym: so that's good because I own.

53
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,000
Rym: I don't have UPCs or anything for anymore anything.

54
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,500
Rym: I have a bear NES cartridge.

55
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:54,291
Scott: Yeah, that's the reason he wanted to not add this feature in the first place But now he's got systems to mitigate the damage.

56
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:56,300
Scott: It will cost from having duplicate entries.

57
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:58,487
Rym: Well, we'll see how it goes.

58
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:02,102
Rym: Yep, but in the news Microsoft.

59
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:07,180
Rym: well at least an analyst that may or may not have been paid off by Microsoft or hired by Microsoft.

60
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:17,978
Rym: But some analysts out there and this is on slashdot said that they expect that the Xbox 360 will sell 12 million units by the end of the year.

61
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,490
Scott: All right, how many have sold so far?

62
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,699
Rym: about 3 million if that?

63
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,824
Scott: So they've got.

64
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:26,551
Scott: how many months has it been since it came out?

65
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:32,474
Rym: Uh, a few a few Alright, not even if you came March starting tomorrow.

66
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:33,860
Scott: It came out in December or November.

67
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:36,772
Rym: I think it came out in late November.

68
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,660
Scott: So it's three months three million.

69
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:44,269
Scott: So at a million a month They've got eight months left in the year.

70
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,776
Scott: That's they might make it.

71
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:55,090
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I mean basically that they're basically talking about how the only reason that the Xbox hasn't sold Well currently is that there isn't any supply.

72
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,555
Scott: There's a billion Japanese ones.

73
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:57,418
Scott: They could bring them on over.

74
00:04:57,658 --> 00:04:58,100
Rym: not even that.

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,550
Rym: They keep saying oh, there's no supply.

76
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,094
Rym: You can't get him.

77
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:00,678
Rym: You can't get him.

78
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:06,360
Rym: They've been slowly making their way into retail spaces and a lot of stores just have an Xbox if you go in there.

79
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:07,645
Scott: I haven't seen one.

80
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:10,357
Scott: every like when I go into stores, they barely have Xbox 360 games.

81
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:17,658
Rym: Oh, yeah, but according to this study at least many retailers have at least one or two base Xbox 360 systems.

82
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:27,028
Scott: Hmm, maybe people are just waiting for the premium ones or anyone who wanted one pre-ordered and got theirs because there weren't more than three Pre-orders.

83
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:28,399
Scott: that's you know, that's just nuts.

84
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:33,720
Scott: Yeah, so all the pre-order people anyone who wanted one pre-order one and got one and no one else wants one.

85
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:53,220
Rym: well, I guess my Evidence that there's really the demand is not as high as they're saying and that the supply is not affecting this as much as they seem to want it to be is Simply that if you go on eBay and try to find an Xbox 360 premium or otherwise There are plenty to be head and they're really not going for any more than you pay in the store

86
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:54,545
Scott: Are really

87
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,779
Rym: yeah, I just did a search just now.

88
00:05:57,141 --> 00:06:02,326
Rym: I saw seven at least in a couple pages just from the search of Xbox 360.

89
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:03,419
Rym: They were the premium system.

90
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:08,674
Rym: Some of them also were through in like two wireless controllers extra or a game extra.

91
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:13,589
Rym: they were going for about four hundred four hundred and fifty Dollars, I thought they're like three hundred dollars in the store.

92
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,094
Rym: what for the premium?

93
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:18,266
Scott: No, no, no Why are people buying these?

94
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:18,789
Scott: to begin with?

95
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:19,693
Scott: that's way too much money.

96
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:25,626
Scott: Uh, yeah Yeah We'll see It could be either way.

97
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,134
Scott: I mean at the rate of a million a month.

98
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:37,392
Scott: if they keep this rate up I mean, they didn't need an analyst to tell them that they'd sell, you know, eight million more in eight months, but At the same time maybe there is no more demand.

99
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:37,733
Scott: Who knows?

100
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,180
Rym: Well, I mean, I guess I brought up.

101
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:52,840
Rym: I brought it up not because this in itself is big news I mean analysts like this come up all the time but just the fact that they keep trying to blame the lack of sales and the fact that there aren't any Xboxes and I really think that even if there were Xboxes, it's not gonna matter.

102
00:06:54,144 --> 00:07:07,807
Rym: Of course then again It won't matter anyway Because the PlayStation 3 if anyone's to be believed is gonna be like ten years late and cost a million dollars Or according to Sony it'll be here like in a couple months Yeah, but Sony just said they're gonna delay it.

103
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:08,430
Rym: possibly pa.

104
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,039
Scott: they said we could delay it.

105
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:12,705
Scott: Yeah, great.

106
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:13,648
Scott: Good job Sony.

107
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:16,580
Scott: whatever Sony hasn't gotten anything right in years.

108
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:21,736
Scott: What's the last thing Sony got right beside since the ps2, uh, there was that ps2.

109
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:29,684
Rym: after that Halo Xbox Dr.

110
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,492
Rym: M. Oh, no, they got bad DRM.

111
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:33,180
Scott: They canceled the eyebo.

112
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:33,943
Rym: You know what?

113
00:07:34,364 --> 00:07:37,396
Rym: Sony was real good at not putting malware on people's computer.

114
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,427
Rym: Oh, wait a minute I guess they're not real good at that.

115
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:44,280
Scott: Oh, they tried to come out with that little, you know iPod competing bean thing.

116
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:46,260
Scott: Okay, they canceled that one.

117
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:49,614
Rym: Oh that you know the fact that it took me that long to realize what the hell you were talking about.

118
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:56,666
Scott: Yeah I mean Somebody's not doing well the PSP.

119
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:57,248
Scott: Yeah.

120
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:58,632
Rym: Yeah PSP.

121
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,999
Rym: Yeah, I wanted to hear more about origami.

122
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:06,080
Scott: actually Yeah, we'll find out soon enough about the origami.

123
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:12,920
Rym: Yeah We'd better because I'm I'm actually a little excited about it depending on how much it ends up actually costing and what it actually does.

124
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:21,536
Scott: And I just figure even no matter what it does is smartphone like one of those HTC wizard things is just as good What I want to do with it.

125
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:27,076
Scott: Anyway Anyway, so the real big news everyone is Apple did something today.

126
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,224
Rym: Whoo Yeah, though.

127
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:31,993
Rym: It wasn't quite as who as I was hoping there was actually.

128
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,320
Scott: that's why they didn't make a huge deal out of it.

129
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,339
Scott: They sent like this little simple invitation and you know, just cuz Apple the internet makes a big deal out of it.

130
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:40,876
Scott: Apple doesn't seem to care.

131
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:48,011
Rym: now my office made at work and of all the things that were announced the one thing that I was slightly excited about was something that wasn't actually announced.

132
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:51,027
Rym: it was just a communication disconnect here.

133
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:54,565
Rym: Mm-hmm, but my office mate at work is He's.

134
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:55,473
Rym: he has a bunch of max.

135
00:08:55,493 --> 00:09:03,419
Rym: He loves max so he's sitting there like in a chat room with people who are there with cell cams like Giving him up-to-date.

136
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:05,168
Rym: Steve Jobs just walked out.

137
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,153
Rym: He said this.

138
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:12,708
Scott: he said this Yeah, see I just wait for people to type that in and then when when he's all done I go and I read the whole thing at once.

139
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,577
Scott: I don't sit there as they type it.

140
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:15,140
Scott: That's just nuts.

141
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:20,680
Rym: Yeah, so, you know it was a new Mac mini and I said, oh expect a new Mac mini is pretty good.

142
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:29,382
Scott: Actually, that's it's got more USBs and it's wicked fast and it's cheap and it has front row and Bonjour On it.

143
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:35,540
Scott: So now you can really plug it into your TV for some awesomeness and the way Bonjour works.

144
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:40,188
Scott: this is the thing where Apple computers or any computer with Bonjour.

145
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:43,839
Scott: I'm pretty sure only Apple computers can have it can like share their media.

146
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:54,320
Scott: So Theoretically if you have a computer, let's say you have a power a double a superpower tower Whatever they call them, you know the dual CPU thingies upstairs, right?

147
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:05,219
Scott: Yeah, and you buy an episode of a TV show on the iTunes store Downstairs on your you know, your Mac minis plugged into your TV with front row.

148
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:15,429
Scott: in Front row if you say watch a movie the Bonjour thing will connect to the other apples on your land and say uh-huh There is a movie up there that we can watch.

149
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,240
Scott: Oh, ho ho ho and that is is a French.

150
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,885
Scott: That was why they call it Bonjour.

151
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,711
Rym: That's your French impression.

152
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,697
Scott: I am NOT a good at the French accent.

153
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:27,831
Rym: Wow I don't even have anything to make funny if or just God.

154
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:30,300
Scott: whatever the point that's you know, I think that's pretty cool.

155
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,330
Rym: Yeah, but I mean it's cool.

156
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,946
Rym: It wasn't really Unexpected like it was.

157
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,251
Scott: actually it was very expected.

158
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,335
Scott: Everyone was like new Mac mini.

159
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:36,757
Scott: Hooray.

160
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:37,600
Rym: Yeah, so no one went.

161
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:40,651
Scott: Yeah, but it is a hooray Mac mini.

162
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,279
Rym: the next thing was the.

163
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:47,900
Rym: The person sitting in my office was like he's called it a boombox because everyone said oh, it looks like a boombox.

164
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:49,727
Scott: It is sort of a boombox.

165
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,816
Rym: Yeah, it's the hi-fi the iPod.

166
00:10:51,836 --> 00:11:00,160
Scott: Hi-fi Basically, it's an iPod dock and it's also a giant box with a bunch of speakers in the front that makes supposedly really nice sound.

167
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:03,960
Scott: I think the box looks really weird and kind of strange.

168
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,241
Scott: I don't.

169
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:08,420
Scott: it doesn't look mean it's white and appley, but now here's the two problems.

170
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:13,560
Rym: I've seen things like that for a lot less money than Apple's gonna sell this.

171
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,134
Scott: They're a lot smaller and a lot less powerful.

172
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:17,844
Scott: This thing's like $400.

173
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,860
Rym: Oh, yeah, this thing's big and expensive and powerful.

174
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:27,000
Rym: But I'll point out that the media you put on an iPod is not always the highest of quality music.

175
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:42,048
Scott: anyway, I think the point of this is that if you use this it's getting the audio out of the Digital iPod dock connector in the bottom and not the not using the iPods Chip to do the decoding.

176
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,312
Scott: so you're getting much better.

177
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:53,340
Rym: So how long until I get a lick sang or Chinese Korean knockoff bootleg dongle that I stick on the bottom of my iPod and get SPDIF out?

178
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:55,257
Scott: now they already had the.

179
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:57,339
Scott: What do you think my I trip does?

180
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:04,740
Rym: Yeah, so well that then uses the FM modulation, which actually makes them it really really down samples and make some.

181
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:05,425
Scott: Yeah, that's bad.

182
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:21,237
Scott: But you know, it's the point is whatever I mean if you're reading the if you're trying to get the audio out of the digital connector at the bottom that you use to dock as opposed to the Audio hole you're basically using the iPod as a hard drive and reading the mp3 is off of it.

183
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:22,100
Scott: That's all you're doing.

184
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,693
Scott: Yeah, so you're not using the you know deep mp3 decoder in the iPod.

185
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,820
Scott: you're using someone that you have somewhere else.

186
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:34,740
Rym: So I guess in that case why not just buy a flash drive or a firewire drive and carry it around?

187
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,208
Scott: The point of this is that this device This big boombox thing Supposedly has really good sound.

188
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:41,791
Scott: I'll believe them.

189
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:43,360
Scott: It's pretty portable.

190
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:46,219
Scott: It runs on D batteries where a lot of the other ones seem to plug in.

191
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:48,640
Scott: It's really big which is not so good.

192
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,850
Scott: But it's also a hi-fi stereo component like you.

193
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,080
Scott: can you know, you got your receipt you got your all your stereo components.

194
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,579
Scott: You can put this one in there too to put iPods in.

195
00:12:58,441 --> 00:12:59,445
Rym: Yeah, I guess it's just.

196
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:00,670
Rym: it's too pricey for me.

197
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,995
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why I didn't win $400 on it.

198
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:07,039
Rym: I mean, I hate all those audio file types, but I like my audio a lot.

199
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:13,582
Scott: This Logitech makes a thing that does the boom Bose does too where you just plug an iPod in and it plays with the music And speakers.

200
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:14,626
Rym: Yeah, this wasn't.

201
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:15,851
Rym: it was surprising.

202
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:17,417
Rym: I didn't expect anything like this to come out.

203
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:18,300
Scott: No, no one did.

204
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:20,054
Rym: It doesn't really do anything for me.

205
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:20,416
Rym: Mm-hmm.

206
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:30,820
Rym: now the confusion came when My office mate turns to me and says they're gonna have an iPod nano five gigs for a hundred dollars.

207
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:32,731
Scott: And I was like, there's no way.

208
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:37,071
Rym: and I was like If you can verify that I'll buy one right now.

209
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:37,452
Scott: I was like.

210
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:38,817
Scott: that makes absolutely no sense.

211
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:39,500
Rym: That's a little fishy.

212
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:41,436
Scott: Yeah, how could they?

213
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:45,391
Scott: Right now a four gig one is two hundred and fifty dollars.

214
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:48,020
Scott: How are they gonna save a hundred and fifty dollars?

215
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,007
Rym: Now what got me to where I was?

216
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:53,560
Rym: I almost believed it was that then he showed me this grainy cell cam picture.

217
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:55,672
Rym: I looked at it and it was a guy.

218
00:13:55,733 --> 00:14:01,908
Rym: it was someone on stage holding a nano Mm-hmm, so I thought hot damn.

219
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:04,014
Scott: then I immediately took it.

220
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:07,428
Scott: with the conference is over by the time we found You know, I heard this from him.

221
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:15,315
Scott: So I went to the complete You know typing up report of the keynote and I searched for the word nano.

222
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:17,000
Rym: now there was in fact a product.

223
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,727
Scott: Yeah, I didn't see the word nano there.

224
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:21,800
Rym: Anyway, but then it turned out there was in fact a new product.

225
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,796
Rym: It contains the word nano in it and it is a hundred dollars.

226
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:33,529
Rym: Mm-hmm It is a leather or something like that Cover for the iPod nano.

227
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,981
Scott: Well, it's also for the newest iPod and Such.

228
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:44,499
Scott: it's just a leather sleeve to put the iPod in its Italian real high quality leather from Apple.

229
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:46,906
Rym: That's a hundred dollars.

230
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:48,511
Scott: that's it's what leather costs.

231
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:49,454
Scott: I guess I don't know.

232
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,260
Scott: no, it's a huge freakin mark up on it.

233
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:51,723
Scott: You know it.

234
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:56,680
Rym: I'll point out that I for anyone who knows me I haven't worn them in a while because I haven't been taking care of them.

235
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,089
Rym: So they're sitting being soaking in oil, but I have some high quality Leather like leather leather leather boots.

236
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:06,160
Rym: They cost me about a hundred and fifty bucks total.

237
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:11,019
Rym: There is not even an eighth of the amount of leather in this iPod thing.

238
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:24,300
Rym: Yeah Who would pay that much money you're paying for the little Apple logo on it, you know, what you know what I'll do here Here, I just drew the Apple logo on a piece of paper 50 bucks trademark infringement.

239
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:27,210
Rym: Fine now, it's an orange awesome.

240
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,456
Scott: No, but I mean like.

241
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:44,529
Scott: I will pay You know some money to get first party, you know accessories like if my car Needed a part I would pay ten bucks more to get a Mazda part as opposed to a You know crummy aftermarket part.

242
00:15:45,132 --> 00:16:07,100
Scott: or if I wanted a Nintendo controller I would spend ten bucks extra to get a Nintendo controller and not a Mad Catz controller but to pay $50 more for an iPod sleeve that is not functional or more functional in any way than the $30 iPod sleeves I can purchase from various accessory manufacturers.

243
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:08,902
Scott: Why that?

244
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:09,704
Scott: what the fuck?

245
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:11,430
Scott: just cuz it goddamn.

246
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,054
Scott: who do they think's gonna buy this?

247
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:14,198
Rym: I don't know.

248
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:14,799
Rym: I don't know.

249
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:20,419
Rym: I mean, I guess from my perspective It'll be another useful thing if I see someone with it.

250
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:28,256
Rym: I know that they're a fool who is easily parted with their money or very or very wealthy in which case Maybe I can get some money out of them.

251
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:36,637
Rym: maybe All right, there is one more little news today Last but certainly not least because it's something I'm probably going to buy.

252
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:48,877
Scott: Yeah well the DS lite which you may or may not know about is sort of like the DS SP and Lick sang got their hands on one, you know our happy importing friends lick sang.

253
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:53,009
Rym: Yes, apparently They said it was bright, you know, it's a play on words.

254
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,820
Rym: It's light because it's lighter and it's light because it's brighter.

255
00:16:56,381 --> 00:17:06,919
Rym: Mm-hmm, the lowest lowest brightness setting on this new one is as bright as the current DS yep, and Apparently the highest setting will hurt you.

256
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,559
Scott: It may burn your retinas.

257
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:23,406
Scott: Well, the thing here is that they've actually increased the battery power output from 850 milli AH whatever that milliamps, I don't know to 1000.

258
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:26,040
Rym: so does that decrease the battery life or is there a bigger battery?

259
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:34,271
Scott: Oh, it means that actually if you keep the brightness at the same brightness at the lowest brightness level Which is the current brightness level of the normal DS.

260
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,240
Scott: You actually get a longer battery life.

261
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:38,377
Rym: Oh somewhat they increase the milli watt hours.

262
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:47,654
Scott: then yeah, and if you raise the The battery light if you raise the brightness all the way up You'll get pretty much the same battery life as the current DS.

263
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:51,368
Rym: not bad Now apparently like Scott told me just before the show.

264
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:54,840
Rym: They also changed the AC power recharging connector.

265
00:17:54,987 --> 00:18:12,580
Scott: Yeah see Nintendo likes to keep the same connectors from system to system like the SNES the N64 and the GameCube all had the same AV connector and the the SP and the DS have the same power connector, but the micro obviously needed a different a smaller one.

266
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:17,314
Scott: So now the SP the DS light comes out and everyone's thinking.

267
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:19,040
Scott: Oh, it'll have the same connector as the micro.

268
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:21,509
Scott: No, it has some brand new connectors.

269
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:22,633
Scott: So I guess they had to.

270
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,580
Rym: yeah, I'm curious as to why I want to see it.

271
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,227
Rym: I haven't looked at the pictures of this yet.

272
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,860
Scott: Yeah, so it just probably comes with a new AC adapter.

273
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,291
Scott: You can't use your DS one or your SP one.

274
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:32,678
Scott: Yeah, what are your light one?

275
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:33,080
Scott: Whatever?

276
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,435
Scott: Also the you can't turn the backlight off all the way.

277
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:41,207
Scott: Oh well The stylus is longer and thicker.

278
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,258
Scott: I guess that's good for big American hands.

279
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:46,454
Rym: I don't know I don't know I can make a joke about a penis.

280
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:50,872
Scott: But yeah Oh and here's the big one you're ready.

281
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:53,665
Scott: the big one the negative The GB.

282
00:18:53,685 --> 00:18:55,537
Scott: there's a little over the GBA slot.

283
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:59,860
Scott: There's a little cover Huh, which is good because right now there's no cover on the GBA slot.

284
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,823
Scott: It's kind of like a.

285
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:04,033
Rym: my GBA slot is never been unoccupied.

286
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:10,420
Rym: Oh, of course, of course, but the point is I mean, it wasn't it Tycho penny arcade who called it like a second holster of gaming.

287
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:13,700
Rym: Yeah, of course, or like the second barrel in my gun of gaming or something?

288
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,117
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly what it is something to go ish.

289
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:26,039
Scott: But at the same time it would be nice if there's like a little flap there or a little removable cover, you know My cell phone even has a little tiny rubber thing that sticks in the bottom data port when I'm not using it.

290
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:30,617
Scott: Yep, so it would be nice if there's a cover and on the light.

291
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:31,260
Scott: There is a cover.

292
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:34,950
Scott: However, there's a problem if you put it.

293
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:43,118
Scott: if you actually take the cover off and put a GBA cartridge in there The GBA cartridge sticks out about a quarter an inch Huh?

294
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,940
Scott: See the reason there's a cover is because you're not gonna want to keep your GBA cartridge in there constantly.

295
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,100
Scott: You're gonna want to take it out when you're not playing and put a thing in there.

296
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:57,140
Rym: I don't know what I think about that because currently there I keep two games in it and I keep the thing in my pocket.

297
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:02,360
Rym: So that way I just have two games with me or I bring the whole giant carrying case around.

298
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:05,958
Rym: I'm not gonna leave a game in it if it jumps out like that.

299
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,722
Rym: Yeah, that means I'm only carrying one game with me or I'm carrying all my games with me Mm-hmm.

300
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:16,580
Scott: If you're carrying all your games with you, then the smallness of the light isn't really an advantage.

301
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:21,340
Scott: Huh, you're really only getting a benefit from the brightness.

302
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:24,632
Rym: Well, basically it comes down and it's better looking.

303
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:35,779
Rym: I guess for me when it comes out I'll go to the store and I'll look at it and I'll probably buy it anyway Just because my DS it's already gotten a lot of use and I'd like to have a new one.

304
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:37,749
Rym: Yeah, and I could.

305
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:39,900
Rym: I honestly I probably give my current DS away.

306
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:42,438
Rym: I know a number of people who would probably be thrilled to have it.

307
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:49,057
Scott: See thing is you know my DS works fine and I use it a lot and I'd probably like to upgrade to like a light.

308
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:55,460
Scott: because I remember when the GBA came out and everyone had the SP and I was like, oh my GBA is just fine and it was just fine.

309
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,144
Scott: But wait a minute.

310
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:56,728
Rym: That's the kind of thing.

311
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,500
Rym: I usually say it was the other one.

312
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,327
Rym: He usually says no upgrade at all cost.

313
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:04,804
Scott: Well, because it was there was no, you know, the SP wasn't really an upgrade It was just the same.

314
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:07,458
Rym: I submit that the SP with its backlighting was.

315
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:13,160
Scott: but yes The thing is I didn't need the backlighting, you know Just like I don't need the GBA cartridge to stick out a quarter an inch.

316
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:20,240
Scott: But nowadays my GBA is really useless, you know, so I can't even play with it.

317
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:23,350
Scott: I can't even use it to play Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles or anything.

318
00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:26,420
Rym: Well, you scratched the hell out of your GBA, too.

319
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,700
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is that the GBA using batteries back in the day wasn't a problem.

320
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,200
Scott: But now the batteries are a problem because I don't because nothing I have really is batteries anymore.

321
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,339
Rym: Honestly, remember when I said I had all those interviews from Katsucon and we couldn't play him.

322
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,616
Rym: Well, the last device in our house that really uses batteries was that boombox.

323
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,359
Rym: We just threw away.

324
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:49,246
Rym: Yeah, the one that was full of batteries It was also full of battery acid.

325
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,687
Rym: one of the two was not inside of the other of the two as it should have been Mm-hmm.

326
00:21:54,882 --> 00:22:00,242
Scott: So, you know, well, I didn't want an SP back then and it really wouldn't have helped me back Then.

327
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:04,540
Scott: it helped me now and it's too late to trade in a GBA for an SP and get a discount.

328
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:06,285
Scott: So maybe I could.

329
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:19,302
Scott: if there's a really good deal of trading in a DS for a light I'll do it but other than that Maybe I'll just hold off and buy one in the future or I'll wait until the DS light comes out with some great new colors Like there's a green one or something.

330
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:27,630
Rym: So things of the day.

331
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,021
Rym: This is kind of an old thing.

332
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,070
Rym: Well, actually it's very old.

333
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:42,770
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about it much But I think it's interesting and any of you who play chess out there and if you've not heard about this you may find it Fascinating if you've never if you don't like chess you will find this incredibly boring.

334
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:48,371
Scott: I have a feeling that people who like chess already know about this and people who don't like chess have no idea what the hell's Going on.

335
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:49,113
Rym: Yeah.

336
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:49,815
Rym: Well, it's just something.

337
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:50,276
Rym: it's more.

338
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:54,729
Rym: it's not so much that I found out about it, but I found a transcript of it.

339
00:22:55,671 --> 00:23:11,090
Rym: it's called the immortal game and basically it was a chess game between two semi famous very good chess players a long time ago and The game itself is widely remembered as one of the most cool interesting and/or strange games of chess that ever happened.

340
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:12,813
Rym: That was recorded.

341
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,417
Scott: At least what was so interesting about it.

342
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:19,170
Rym: I'm not good enough at chess to really say can't even say one thing.

343
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:31,470
Rym: well, I can say that the way the game worked out is it started out very simply and Then one guy set up this really cool like defensive wall Diagonally and they were jumping back and forth.

344
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,830
Rym: Anyway, that's that's the deepest analysis I can give of it not being very good at chess myself.

345
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:37,213
Scott: All right.

346
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,180
Scott: Can you at least say why?

347
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,409
Scott: it was the immortal game?

348
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,401
Rym: It's the immortal game because it's the most widely remembered long-lived game.

349
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:51,694
Rym: All right, that's that's the explanation I'd always been given because I had a friend back in high school who was really good at chess like he could meet it in tournaments.

350
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:57,037
Rym: he was really good and No one would play chess with him because he just won.

351
00:23:57,057 --> 00:24:03,898
Rym: I 15 year old we found on the street.

352
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:06,570
Scott: I hate people like that with the chest just beating you.

353
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:09,130
Rym: It's kind of bleh what someone's good at something.

354
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:15,749
Scott: No, no No, cuz like usually when you play against a master if you're an amateur your random amateurness kind of messes them up.

355
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:18,730
Scott: But in chess if someone knows they're doing this kick.

356
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:24,976
Rym: Oh, actually if you want to get into the details, it did mess him up and he hated playing against me because He'd win every time.

357
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,482
Scott: well, then he wasn't a real master.

358
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:28,329
Scott: cuz I know the real masters just kick your ass.

359
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:32,789
Rym: Well, no cuz he wouldn't kick my ass partly on purpose because you know, that'd be an asshole thing to do.

360
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:40,678
Rym: but basically it would screw him up because I'm just kind of moving willy-nilly and He just kind of pieces would go back and forth.

361
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:53,417
Rym: and once I got down where I only had like three pieces left or five pieces left I could think real far ahead and I could hold him off for a long time and do a lot of damage, but Then he just beat me.

362
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:55,190
Scott: Well, cuz you only had five pieces left.

363
00:24:55,491 --> 00:25:00,130
Rym: Yeah, and one time I asked him to go all out on me and not pull any punches and he just creamed me immediately.

364
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:04,870
Rym: Yeah, but anyway this game I'd heard about a lot.

365
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,775
Rym: he'd mentioned it before.

366
00:25:06,016 --> 00:25:10,732
Rym: a lot of people who played chess that I've known have talked about this before and Here it is.

367
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,983
Rym: Here's a move by move transcript of this famous game of chess.

368
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:15,810
Rym: I've got no more to say about it.

369
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:16,959
Scott: It's like a little video.

370
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:18,249
Rym: Maybe no no video.

371
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,099
Scott: Maybe someone will make a video.

372
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:21,630
Scott: we can watch it fast-forwarding or something.

373
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:28,935
Rym: Well, my one nice thing about this site that I found is that it talks about this game of chess as though You don't know anything about chess.

374
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:30,059
Scott: Oh, that's cool.

375
00:25:30,922 --> 00:25:31,404
Rym: So it was.

376
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:32,749
Rym: it's an interesting read I think.

377
00:25:35,044 --> 00:25:39,809
Scott: hmm, so Everyone here knows video games and cosplays and all these nerdy things.

378
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,902
Scott: There's a girl in Britain and she's kind of cute kinda.

379
00:25:44,283 --> 00:25:45,586
Scott: I mean her face is pretty cute.

380
00:25:45,747 --> 00:25:46,810
Scott: Her body's kind of normal.

381
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:48,853
Scott: That's not the point.

382
00:25:49,374 --> 00:25:50,758
Scott: the point is this girl cosplays.

383
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:55,772
Rym: she cosplays specifically as Princess Peach fairly well as Princess Peach I might add.

384
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:57,739
Scott: I think she's just a Princess Peach fanatic.

385
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,441
Scott: Actually.

386
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:00,870
Scott: I'm 100% sure she's a Princess Peach fanatic.

387
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,274
Rym: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

388
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:03,659
Scott: There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

389
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:06,548
Scott: In fact, it is good is two more commendable.

390
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:11,781
Scott: Yes So she started an eBay auction today for poses.

391
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:15,290
Scott: you pay her money and she will pose in any pose.

392
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,537
Scott: You want any non dirty pose?

393
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:23,577
Scott: Yeah, so she won't show you her boobies or you know her bits But her boobies her naughty bits.

394
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,502
Rym: you called them her boobies.

395
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,929
Scott: Well, she's if she's a princess peach their boobies.

396
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:30,760
Rym: Okay, what if she were Daisy?

397
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,966
Rym: What would you have called them then?

398
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:32,650
Rym: knockers?

399
00:26:35,613 --> 00:26:40,075
Scott: All right, so there you go, um And you can pretty much.

400
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:41,200
Scott: she has a lot of props.

401
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,490
Scott: like she has Bob bombs and and question blocks.

402
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,155
Scott: I saw a change change arms.

403
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:47,802
Scott: So if you or mushrooms, I'm sure.

404
00:26:48,283 --> 00:26:54,687
Scott: so if you could tell her like I want you to pose You know smiling and holding a mushroom in the air or something like that.

405
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:58,768
Scott: or you know holding the rutabaga from Mario 2 over your head like you just dug it out of the ground.

406
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:05,329
Scott: or and She would you know get a picture taken of herself wearing this cosplay in the pose you want and send it to you.

407
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:10,845
Scott: So that was what got the attempt heard the internet-wide attention today.

408
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:11,950
Scott: eBay auction.

409
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:14,690
Scott: But also she has a nice little store.

410
00:27:15,172 --> 00:27:19,690
Scott: I think it's called peach paradise or something and she sells all kinds of really good Nintendo stuff.

411
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:33,217
Scott: Like she had a Zelda pin that was caught kind of cool that I wanted and like an f1 racing Mario pin and she had some gift wrapping tape that had like little mushrooms and Bloopers and all kinds of cool stuff on

412
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:33,799
Rym: ha ha ha,

413
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:36,450
Scott: you know, I think I might go buy some of this stuff.

414
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,096
Scott: It's pretty cheap.

415
00:27:37,318 --> 00:27:38,690
Scott: It was all in British pounds though.

416
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,796
Scott: So it's actually more money.

417
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:42,350
Scott: and the shipping because you know, she's British.

418
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:44,054
Rym: Yeah, you never know.

419
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:46,524
Rym: Maybe she'll go to an Otakon or something.

420
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:53,070
Rym: Yeah, right Hey people from Japan came to Otakon two years ago just to see that band.

421
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,870
Scott: Yeah, we'll see if anyone comes this year, but maybe I'll order some stuff from this cool store before someone else buys it.

422
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:00,908
Scott: I mean, I don't think her stock is too big.

423
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:05,321
Rym: No, and now that she's being hit by every freaking site in the world including us.

424
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,010
Scott: Yeah, so that's all I gotta say.

425
00:28:09,512 --> 00:28:09,833
Rym: All right.

426
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:11,663
Rym: So moving on to the topic.

427
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:16,689
Rym: We said we'd talk about and It's a topic that's generated a lot of anger here in the geek house.

428
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:19,335
Scott: It seems to have only generated anger.

429
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:19,395
Scott: No.

430
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:25,070
Rym: No, it generated a little bit of desperation a lot of anguish and almost a crying.

431
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:28,852
Scott: it got rid of Disappointment.

432
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:30,138
Rym: Oh, yeah disappointment.

433
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:32,549
Rym: It also killed at least a couple hours.

434
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:39,758
Scott: Yeah, but at least some of the all the a lot of the hours that killed were me at work So it actually saved me from some pain.

435
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:42,990
Rym: So penny arcade has their card game.

436
00:28:43,594 --> 00:28:45,350
Scott: Well, they don't really have the card game.

437
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:45,531
Scott: It's.

438
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:50,070
Scott: it's more like they want to make merchandise to make money, which is cool because that's how they make all their money.

439
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:56,445
Scott: Yeah and they decided making a CCG would be a good idea or I don't know if maybe the other people decided it would be a Good idea and ask them to do it.

440
00:28:57,131 --> 00:29:01,230
Rym: But they have this game and it's part of the universal fighting system by saber-tooth games.

441
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:05,453
Scott: now the idea of the universal fighting system is the There.

442
00:29:05,514 --> 00:29:15,132
Scott: theoretically there would be a CCG where you could Collect all sorts of different cards from all sorts of different sets and mix and match them and they would all work according to the same role,

443
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:20,999
Rym: so right now I could have taiko versus Gabe or Gabe versus Taki from Soulcalibur.

444
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,229
Scott: Yeah when we bought this we you get a gave in a taiko box.

445
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:26,534
Scott: It's basically two boxes.

446
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,139
Scott: One of them is Gabe and one of them is taiko.

447
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,430
Scott: and it comes there pretty nice little card holding boxes.

448
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:33,290
Scott: They're really cute and they have lots of art on them.

449
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,169
Rym: And in fact right now we're gonna talk about every positive aspect of this game.

450
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:42,485
Scott: The box it comes in is cool and the art is awesome penny arcade art.

451
00:29:42,686 --> 00:29:42,847
Rym: Yep.

452
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:43,950
Rym: I'm opening it right now.

453
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,330
Scott: It's high quality with a piece of velcro.

454
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:48,054
Scott: Hear that velcro.

455
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:49,720
Rym: Yeah, the piece of velcro is really key here.

456
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:52,630
Scott: There's a little card that that's your life meter.

457
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:55,661
Rym: It's really thick in quality and it's got art on it.

458
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:56,223
Scott: Yep.

459
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:58,030
Rym: That's really says my character's name here.

460
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:03,457
Rym: It says taiko at the top in all caps Mm-hmm The cards smell really nice.

461
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,970
Rym: Yeah, not as good as magic cards, but definitely a nice smell here.

462
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:09,839
Scott: They smell a lot like Pokemon cards did back in the day.

463
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:13,170
Rym: Um, there are some funny texts on the cards.

464
00:30:13,732 --> 00:30:15,379
Scott: Oh, yeah, this one card here.

465
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,515
Scott: Let me try to find it mine leapin John I'm leapin.

466
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:20,037
Rym: I don't know.

467
00:30:20,057 --> 00:30:21,662
Rym: My favorite card here is skullduggery.

468
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:22,605
Scott: That's pretty.

469
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,709
Scott: that says good picture on it.

470
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:24,673
Rym: All right.

471
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:28,910
Rym: This is one of the worst games I've ever experienced.

472
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:33,156
Scott: Wait, wait, wait, it's better than Hellas All right.

473
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:35,126
Rym: Now see I disagree on that.

474
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:35,588
Scott: Okay.

475
00:30:35,608 --> 00:30:41,587
Scott: No, wait There's only one reason why I think this game is better than Hellas because we did figure out most of the rules.

476
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:51,701
Scott: in Hellas There are rules questions that can never be answered because no one is there to answer them Because the universal fighting system people at saber-tooth games have a forum.

477
00:30:52,543 --> 00:31:00,298
Scott: all of the questions in this game are eventually answered Possibly because I'll note that they've stopped Answering questions on the forum.

478
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:01,546
Scott: Oh, no, that's that's not true.

479
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:18,570
Scott: that would Basically, they had people who staff the forums like paid employees and yesterday There was a guy there and he was watching the forums Like he deleted one of my posts because I tried to bump up a thread and I didn't realize they didn't like it when you Bump up threads, but today it didn't seem like there was any forum activity whatsoever.

480
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,890
Scott: And I'm sure when those people get back to work that the forum activity will continue.

481
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:25,457
Scott: But there was of all the question.

482
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:35,581
Scott: I went through every single card in this game and every single rule in the shitty shitty rule book or rule paper whatever you want to call it and I found every single problem I could possibly think of.

483
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:38,328
Scott: and there was still one unresolved question.

484
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:46,270
Scott: because Not because of anything in the rule book even because they added a rule that is not in any rule book anywhere in the forum.

485
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:51,747
Scott: So imagine if a game has just this rule that only exists in the forum and you don't even.

486
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:56,779
Rym: it's not even an errata It's just some bits that you saw on someone's website.

487
00:31:56,979 --> 00:32:02,843
Scott: Yeah, it's a brand new rule that's on their website and nowhere else Like oh, yeah, there's also this rule.

488
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:03,628
Scott: You should play with it.

489
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:13,282
Rym: Now the first time we played the game we were struggling through the rules and basically at every juncture at every point I tried to play a card draw a card do anything.

490
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:14,709
Rym: There was a rules dispute.

491
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:22,470
Scott: Not only that but if there wasn't a rules dispute there was a feeling of oh that game mechanic is dumb.

492
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:23,997
Scott: I understand it and it's stupid.

493
00:32:24,198 --> 00:32:26,569
Rym: Yeah, basically every turn would go along like this.

494
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:31,564
Rym: I try to play an attack called large animal tranquilizer.

495
00:32:31,986 --> 00:32:33,410
Scott: It's got has the best picture on it.

496
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:33,691
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:32:34,173 --> 00:32:36,240
Rym: All right, so I have to make a control check.

498
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:36,621
Rym: Whatever.

499
00:32:36,962 --> 00:32:37,725
Rym: How does that work?

500
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:39,170
Rym: I thought it worked this way.

501
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:40,402
Rym: No, it actually works this way.

502
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:42,655
Rym: Oh That's kind of shitty.

503
00:32:42,976 --> 00:32:44,842
Scott: Yep, pretty much no matter what happened.

504
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:50,778
Scott: We were either stuck in a rut of Misunderstanding and confusion or dread of.

505
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,870
Scott: we understand but it's terrible because the truth sucks.

506
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:59,569
Rym: We've never actually completed a game completely to the end where one of us was dead.

507
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:06,210
Rym: Yep, the first time we played the game sucked like it really sucked where we won't stop playing a game.

508
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,035
Rym: All right This is one of the game.

509
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:13,861
Rym: this and goa are the only games we have ever given up on Halfway through the first playing.

510
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:20,830
Rym: but at least goa We're gonna come back to because that was just a bad time to try to learn that game and it's a really complicated game.

511
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:24,533
Scott: this is also really complicated, but this is Complicated with.

512
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:27,943
Scott: no it doesn't seem like there's a reward for your efforts goa.

513
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:30,090
Scott: I think is actually a good game once you understand it.

514
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:33,710
Scott: Yeah this no matter how much you understand the game doesn't get any better.

515
00:33:34,091 --> 00:33:37,707
Rym: I mean consider this the first time we played it the rules didn't work and we couldn't figure it out.

516
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:38,389
Rym: It was not fun.

517
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:47,588
Rym: So we endeavored to learn how the game really worked and Scott did all his research and then we came back to the table the next day or a few days later knowing exactly how to play.

518
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,695
Rym: and The game was worse.

519
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:55,205
Rym: because now we were actually following all the horrible horrible arbitrary crap.

520
00:33:55,266 --> 00:34:00,776
Rym: poorly written infinitely adjectives rules Mm-hmm.

521
00:34:00,796 --> 00:34:09,581
Scott: I mean there are just so many things in this game like They expect little kids to figure this stuff out.

522
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:11,670
Rym: little kids they expect me to figure this game out.

523
00:34:11,972 --> 00:34:13,969
Rym: We're fucking veteran German board gamers.

524
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:18,770
Rym: We play games that say four hours on the outside of the box and do indeed take four hours.

525
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:21,010
Rym: This game is not playable.

526
00:34:21,504 --> 00:34:33,353
Scott: I Think that soon as I open up the rule if it comes a little paper that you unfold with all the rules on it And the rules are written so poorly like I don't know what they were thinking Like.

527
00:34:33,714 --> 00:34:33,914
Rym: I mean.

528
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:39,790
Rym: basically the rules are really kind of meandering and slow and they skip around.

529
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,041
Rym: They don't explain concepts in detail.

530
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:45,135
Rym: They don't use precise language Which that's the number.

531
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:48,270
Scott: one thing is the language is so incredibly imprecise.

532
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:49,657
Rym: I mean look at a German board game.

533
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:56,589
Rym: the rules will say something like on your turn You must do X. you may then do Y if you choose.

534
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:57,630
Rym: All right.

535
00:34:57,871 --> 00:35:02,034
Rym: So I have to do X and then if I want to I can do Y but I can choose not to do This game.

536
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:03,299
Rym: there was none of that.

537
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,210
Rym: it was just like some fifth grader wrote a paragraph on something.

538
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:08,821
Scott: Yep, it's like.

539
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:09,570
Scott: I don't know how they does.

540
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:14,949
Scott: It seems like they came up with a base idea for a game and then he just kept piling stuff on to it.

541
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:20,810
Rym: Yeah, basically my guess as to what happened is that they wanted this game and they wanted to be extensible.

542
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:25,289
Rym: So they made the base game and then they started play testing it and it seemed to work.

543
00:35:25,932 --> 00:35:30,410
Rym: Then they started writing cards and adding cards to the game and I think every tenth card.

544
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,026
Rym: They said wait a minute that card breaks the game.

545
00:35:33,046 --> 00:35:36,018
Rym: Oh Well, what if we just add this rule in?

546
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,921
Rym: Oh that fixes it.

547
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:40,163
Rym: Okay, and I think they did that often Mm-hmm.

548
00:35:41,411 --> 00:35:46,247
Rym: Now, I guess we could go into a description in great detail of these specific game mechanics.

549
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:47,009
Rym: that piss us off.

550
00:35:48,152 --> 00:35:48,655
Scott: Why don't we?

551
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,348
Scott: let's talk about check this out All right.

552
00:35:51,551 --> 00:36:05,797
Rym: So aside from the fact that the rules are unintelligible and that the people who made the game Saber tooth the people who made this goddamn game cannot clarify their own rules in an effective manner Alright, so let's start out with the first thing.

553
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:14,038
Rym: the basic fundamental thing in this game is the control check which alright It took a while to understand once we understood it.

554
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,281
Rym: It's stupid.

555
00:36:15,682 --> 00:36:17,507
Rym: It's just arbitrary random and silly.

556
00:36:17,988 --> 00:36:23,183
Scott: every card has two numbers on it one in the top left and one in the bottom right.

557
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:28,583
Scott: the top left is the Difficulty and the bottom right is the control value.

558
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:30,450
Scott: I guess I guess that's what you want to call it.

559
00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:31,457
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

560
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:32,970
Rym: I call it the as value.

561
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:36,401
Scott: Yeah So let's say in your hand you want to use a card.

562
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:38,690
Scott: the card has a difficulty of four.

563
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:46,050
Scott: If you want to use it What you do is you take the top card of your deck and turn it over into your discard pile and you look at the?

564
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,853
Scott: Control number.

565
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:48,219
Rym: All right, let's say it's a two.

566
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:49,745
Rym: I didn't make the check.

567
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:50,829
Rym: I needed at least a four.

568
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:56,530
Rym: So I either have to put use other cards which I'll get to to bring that number up to four.

569
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:59,921
Rym: But if I fail this control check, I have to discard the card.

570
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,687
Rym: I tried to play and the card.

571
00:37:01,707 --> 00:37:02,430
Rym: I just flipped over.

572
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:04,276
Scott: Oh and your turn is over.

573
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:09,800
Rym: Yeah, your turns over immediately if you ever fail one of these things, too Yep, so you basically play things.

574
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,724
Scott: play things play things.

575
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:12,210
Scott: you fail the control check your turns over.

576
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:18,408
Rym: Basically every time you try to do something There's a chance your turtle just end and that chance increases the more things you try to do.

577
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:21,269
Rym: Mm-hmm, it adds a lot of randomness into the game.

578
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:23,450
Rym: It doesn't really add strategy.

579
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:29,010
Rym: The most it adds is that you can risk trying to play one more car that you might not get out there.

580
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:52,871
Scott: I think the real point of it is that what they trying to do is if you made a CCG where this customizing and collecting and You don't add all this crazy shit like this What happens is if cards just do something and have a base value to them People will just select the best cards and make the best deck and it'll be easy to do So.

581
00:37:52,891 --> 00:38:03,568
Rym: now magic the gathering solve this by having cards cost different amounts of mana And you have to tap different lands to bring out cards and more powerful cards took more taps to bring out.

582
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:06,402
Rym: Mm-hmm This game does it with a system.

583
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:07,790
Rym: I like to call a random bullshit.

584
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:13,190
Scott: Yep, it's if the card is more difficult to use and more powerful.

585
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:20,230
Scott: Your chances of being able to use it are more or less as opposed to in magic where you could eventually use everything.

586
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,410
Scott: It just took longer and you would have to do it later in the game.

587
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:37,006
Scott: So yeah, it's not the greatest game mechanic But what it does is it really makes you think when you're making your deck because now you have to say Alright, let me use all these really powerful cards that have high difficulties.

588
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,542
Scott: Oh Every single one of my cards is a really low control number.

589
00:38:41,562 --> 00:38:43,288
Scott: I'll never actually be able to get anything out.

590
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,522
Scott: now I have to take out some of these really great cards with high difficulties.

591
00:38:46,944 --> 00:38:51,413
Scott: put in some crap cards with low difficulties and high control numbers or you know, it's.

592
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:58,462
Scott: there isn't even really a pattern to it like some cards have high control numbers and high difficulties and Some cards are useful for blocking.

593
00:38:58,482 --> 00:39:02,869
Scott: so you don't want to actually use them You want to hold them into your hand to block with them and God?

594
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:10,962
Rym: Yeah, I'm starting to think that while they tried to balance the game I don't think they really balanced it mathematically.

595
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,070
Rym: I think they balanced it haphazardly.

596
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:15,930
Scott: They definitely balance it haphazardly.

597
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,754
Scott: There's even a lot of.

598
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:27,044
Scott: there is even stuff on the card that isn't used in the base Tycho and Gabe game but is used in the full Customizable uso on my little Tycho evil genius card.

599
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:28,470
Rym: It has little pictures on it.

600
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,470
Rym: You know like say it has a picture of a skull or a picture of a scale.

601
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:34,975
Rym: Now it doesn't.

602
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:42,264
Rym: there's nowhere in the rulebook to say what these are other than that They're not used unless you play with other decks are used in the full UFS rules.

603
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:50,169
Rym: Basically, they're kind of like mana but they're more like you have to have one of those symbols on your character card in order to play another card.

604
00:39:50,189 --> 00:39:52,360
Rym: and There's all these other rules of all.

605
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,389
Rym: I'm not gonna get into the details.

606
00:39:54,331 --> 00:40:03,230
Rym: Now Tycho's deck comes with a card the fruit fucker that under those rules He cannot ever under any circumstances actually play.

607
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:11,140
Scott: Yep, so if you were playing in a UFS tournament, you couldn't actually use the Tycho deck You'd have to remove the fruit fucker and at least one other card I know of.

608
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:19,087
Rym: yep That is just not legal according to their rules the rules that are online that are not in the rule book that came with the game and they're in the forums.

609
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:28,369
Scott: and actually there was one more problem that came up when we were playing just now and I went online because I thought the answer was there and I thought didn't know if I forgot it or not and I could not find it.

610
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,517
Scott: It's not there Here's.

611
00:40:31,537 --> 00:40:33,650
Scott: it is another is an example of something else stupid.

612
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:40,980
Scott: So you have a card right and the card has an ability on it and it the ability says Do something with this cost.

613
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:52,117
Scott: then it says right under that You may only you know do this Under the fall under this condition and as a condition It doesn't say.

614
00:40:52,137 --> 00:41:02,515
Scott: it doesn't specify because of the wording is so vague Whether that condition applies to just the ability above it or The entire card itself.

615
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:04,540
Scott: It says you can't play this unless.

616
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:08,290
Scott: does that mean I can't play the card unless which doesn't work?

617
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:11,800
Scott: Or does it mean I can't play the ability unless?

618
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:26,710
Scott: the answer is it means you can't play the ability unless but the type setting didn't Lend itself to me automatically Associating that conditional clause with the ability because it was a. there was a carriage return.

619
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:29,719
Scott: Now also the wording didn't either.

620
00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:32,310
Rym: there's this mechanic of you make attacks.

621
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:33,895
Rym: That's the primary way to win.

622
00:41:33,915 --> 00:41:35,702
Rym: you attack the other person to do damage to them.

623
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:37,990
Rym: now attacks can be blocked.

624
00:41:38,612 --> 00:41:45,109
Rym: But get this an attack can be high medium or low and you can block high medium or low.

625
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:49,881
Rym: Mm-hmm and different cards have different attack values and different block values.

626
00:41:50,222 --> 00:41:52,187
Scott: Well, only attack cards have attack values.

627
00:41:52,227 --> 00:41:52,628
Scott: Well, yeah.

628
00:41:52,668 --> 00:42:05,690
Rym: Yeah, however the the way blocking works is counterintuitive because Basically, you take the number of the quickness on the attack card and add it to the number of the block on the block card.

629
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,272
Rym: You're playing.

630
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:10,509
Rym: then you have to make a control check of the number you just got and beat it.

631
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:15,425
Scott: So if the attack is fast and has a high speed value you have to make a tough.

632
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:17,391
Scott: it makes the control check to block Harder.

633
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:18,374
Scott: that's understandable.

634
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:25,994
Scott: if the block has a very large number that makes the control check to successfully block Even harder.

635
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:28,243
Scott: you would think that maybe they just put a minus.

636
00:42:28,564 --> 00:42:34,310
Scott: so that high block numbers Would make sense makes it easier to block things not harder.

637
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:38,630
Scott: But no a block of plus zero is the best block that I've seen.

638
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:48,070
Rym: Now the also net benefit of this Well, I guess not net benefit, but the exact opposite of that is that blocking is apparently almost impossible.

639
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:54,149
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I don't think an attack was ever successfully blocked without a special ability in any of the times We played this game.

640
00:42:54,256 --> 00:43:06,590
Scott: Yeah taiko has the ability to automatically block an attack but Gabe has a lot of attack cards a whole lot of attack cards and a lot of a built ways to attack multiple times And just get right around that ability.

641
00:43:07,412 --> 00:43:17,269
Scott: Like he has an attack card mine leap in where he attacks and even though if the attack is blocked he can still use his enhanced abilities during the attack to deal some damage.

642
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:24,609
Scott: and then if taiko used his ability to block that now Gabe can come in with more attacks and deal a crap ton of damage.

643
00:43:24,629 --> 00:43:28,098
Scott: and You can't block unless you have a block card in your hand.

644
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,105
Rym: and then then you probably can't.

645
00:43:30,305 --> 00:43:36,670
Scott: and even then you could only block If your block is, you know only one distance away from the type of attack.

646
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:43,421
Scott: So if he attacks low and you have a high block you can't block with it And then you can only block if you make the control check.

647
00:43:43,441 --> 00:43:45,693
Scott: and if you don't make the control check you to throw the block out.

648
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:58,404
Scott: so I Had only one block in my hand and during most turns So all Rym had to do is attack once and usually I failed the block And if I didn't you just dealt a bunch of damage to me.

649
00:43:58,685 --> 00:43:59,830
Scott: It's like a race to do damage.

650
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:05,316
Rym: Now all that aside the game mechanics are kind of broken.

651
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:12,534
Rym: the rules are vague and hard to understand errata is almost meaningless and hard to find and It's just not fun.

652
00:44:13,116 --> 00:44:14,642
Rym: Yeah, but maybe there's a game there.

653
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:19,260
Rym: you'd think if the game's so complex There got to be some sort of strategy going on.

654
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:24,382
Rym: Well, the answer is a Can of coke could play this game much like you go.

655
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:25,990
Scott: Well, the thing is in yugioh.

656
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:31,010
Rym: I think the mechanic in the mechanic in yugioh is draw card play a card draw card play a card till someone wins, correct?

657
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:38,681
Scott: So in yugioh, you don't actually need to have any Sort of human thought in this game, you know, there's actually it's.

658
00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:38,942
Scott: it's.

659
00:44:39,082 --> 00:44:46,770
Scott: there isn't a strategy like decisions You have to make but a can of coke could not select the correct card from the hand to play.

660
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,278
Rym: Well, no, but I'll bet a monkey could.

661
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:58,204
Rym: a monkey probably could if it could read yeah, basically the only factor that decides who wins is One what cards are in your deck?

662
00:44:58,968 --> 00:44:59,109
Rym: two?

663
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,109
Rym: Do you or what order do you draw them in?

664
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,834
Scott: What order are they in your deck?

665
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:05,940
Scott: because what do you turn over for?

666
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,090
Rym: control also matters because the decisions you make in this game?

667
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,889
Rym: There are basically two kinds of decisions.

668
00:45:11,632 --> 00:45:27,181
Rym: You can make a decision that has a random effect on the game and may or may not help you win but you have no way of knowing or You can make the correct decision when there is a choice for example do I play this attack card or do I not?

669
00:45:27,582 --> 00:45:29,368
Rym: and the answer is always obvious.

670
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:38,725
Rym: and Basically, you always make the optimal move because if you don't make the optimal move You're either not a sentient being or you didn't have the cards to make the optimal move.

671
00:45:38,745 --> 00:45:39,427
Rym: Mm-hmm.

672
00:45:39,608 --> 00:45:40,270
Rym: There's no game.

673
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:41,095
Scott: I mean you.

674
00:45:41,135 --> 00:45:47,329
Scott: basically the hard part of this game Not that it's hard is just paying attention to all the cards you have in front of you.

675
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:53,242
Scott: If you you know Someone will lose like I had an ability on some cards in front of me.

676
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:58,202
Scott: that says if I have more cards in my hand Than Rym and is currently a fight going on.

677
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:04,276
Scott: I can deal damage to him for free of course if That situation arises.

678
00:46:04,296 --> 00:46:09,784
Scott: I'm going to want to do that 100% of the time and it would be stupid not to Because it's free damage.

679
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:10,229
Scott: Why not?

680
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,745
Scott: You know, he starts out with less health than me because taiko has left health less health than Gabe.

681
00:46:15,246 --> 00:46:16,069
Scott: That's how the game works.

682
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:19,409
Scott: So not dealing free damage is dumb.

683
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:25,090
Scott: But the hard part is just remembering that they're there and remembering to use them.

684
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:30,690
Scott: The person who loses this game is the person who just forgets to use all the cards they have available to them.

685
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:32,720
Rym: So at no point does skill enter into it.

686
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:41,909
Scott: No, all that matters is Reading all the cards you have knowing all the cards you have Looking at the other guy's cards knowing what they are.

687
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:47,327
Rym: You know, it's just knowing and spending hours actually learning how the rules work.

688
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:54,005
Scott: Yeah I mean, I don't know how a little kid if I bought this for a little kid How the hell would they play like a 15 year old kid?

689
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:54,970
Scott: How the hell would he figure it out?

690
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:55,472
Rym: You know what?

691
00:46:55,834 --> 00:46:56,838
Rym: They weren't wouldn't care.

692
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,109
Rym: They'd read the rules once and they just play it wrong with each other.

693
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:00,393
Scott: Yeah, they probably would.

694
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,439
Scott: I played magic wrong the first time.

695
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:07,201
Scott: really we played magic the first time everything had trample and we thought trample did something else.

696
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:11,215
Scott: So like I would because it you know It kind of made sense.

697
00:47:11,255 --> 00:47:13,930
Scott: if I attack with four and he defends with one I do three damage.

698
00:47:14,492 --> 00:47:16,199
Scott: That made sense and you know for little kids.

699
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:18,869
Scott: Yeah, you know, but then the second time we played we went.

700
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,635
Scott: oh That's not right.

701
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:22,307
Scott: Hmm, and we fixed it up.

702
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:28,110
Scott: But at least that was easy to fix and we did that only with little tiny rule books that came with magic.

703
00:47:29,051 --> 00:47:30,356
Scott: Think about the rule book that comes with.

704
00:47:30,377 --> 00:47:33,590
Scott: this doesn't even come with an example of play not a single one.

705
00:47:33,871 --> 00:47:37,650
Scott: I had to go online and there was a shoddily written example of play.

706
00:47:38,491 --> 00:47:39,895
Rym: It's rambling and arbitrary.

707
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:42,202
Rym: The game is rambling and arbitrary and horrid.

708
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:44,890
Rym: horrid is the only word I can use to describe this game.

709
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:54,721
Rym: I cannot stress to you enough Do not buy the penny arcade game if you have any intention of playing well the penny arcade Collectible card game from saber-tooth games using the UFS.

710
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:57,090
Scott: There might be another penny arcade game in the future.

711
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,629
Rym: This is currently the only penny arcade game that you can buy with money.

712
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:02,621
Scott: Oh, I think there is a video game with some penny arcade mod.

713
00:48:02,661 --> 00:48:03,785
Scott: But what this doesn't count.

714
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:04,969
Scott: now that doesn't count.

715
00:48:06,711 --> 00:48:09,840
Scott: Yeah, this game is just bad bad bad bad.

716
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:15,259
Rym: now in addition to the game being bad the website of Universal fighting system, you know saber-tooth games.

717
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:18,090
Scott: In fact all the entire saber-tooth games website is atrocious.

718
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:20,577
Rym: I don't think they know how to use these interwebs.

719
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:23,103
Scott: They barely talk on their forums.

720
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:28,617
Rym: Yeah, they definitely did not hire Good web developers or anything.

721
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,345
Scott: They seem to be pretty good at publishing games though.

722
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:32,890
Scott: I mean, this is well put together.

723
00:48:33,091 --> 00:48:35,179
Rym: Yeah high production values for the game too bad.

724
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:36,987
Rym: They didn't design a game for it.

725
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,997
Scott: Yeah, I Mean, I wonder if taiko knows.

726
00:48:40,037 --> 00:48:42,770
Scott: taiko's a gamer and I'm sure he's tried to play his own game.

727
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,336
Scott: I wonder if he realizes it's crap.

728
00:48:44,397 --> 00:48:45,561
Scott: He hasn't said anything about it.

729
00:48:45,702 --> 00:48:47,610
Rym: Yeah, I'm really curious what they'll have to say.

730
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:48,232
Scott: I mean you.

731
00:48:48,413 --> 00:48:58,749
Scott: if you really like penny arcade a whole lot and you better like it more than we like it and we like It a lot You should buy this for the you know, the art and the little stuff that comes with elk row.

732
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:08,210
Scott: Yeah velcro man beat that and the funny cards but That's only if you know, you never plan on playing it in the first place.

733
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,809
Scott: You're just gonna keep it there and then look at it and have fun with it.

734
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:16,969
