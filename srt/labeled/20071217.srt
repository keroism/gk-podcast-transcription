1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,508
Rym: It's Monday December 17th.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,371
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:15,300
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:19,159
Rym: Technology in education and why it's not going so well.

5
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:25,074
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:35,210
Rym: Well for perhaps the first time ever the visigoths came over and they uh didn't visit got the house so much.

7
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:37,518
Scott: Yeah, that was pretty good times.

8
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:44,630
Scott: actually you know on one hand there were fewer visigoths But on the other hand the visigoths that were missing were not the worst of the visigoths.

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,794
Scott: So it's it's hard to tell.

10
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:50,370
Scott: is it is it a matter of who comes that is the worst the cause of the problem?

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,755
Scott: Or is it a matter of how many come?

12
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:51,996
Scott: and I'm?

13
00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:55,690
Scott: or maybe to lean towards is just how many come and not who?

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:03,110
Rym: Maybe it was just the fact that there was a blizzard and a bunch of them were stuck here So they had to clean the house up before they left or they would have looked extra visigoths.

15
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:07,370
Scott: Yeah, we could have easily told who it was because you know some people stay here longer.

16
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:11,142
Scott: You know then that we know which problem which which messes are made by who.

17
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:19,410
Rym: also possibly and I realize this now My character in our game almost died, and now he's kind of an invalid right now.

18
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,495
Scott: Maybe they felt awesome.

19
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:22,238
Scott: isn't burning wheel?

20
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,943
Scott: great that shit never would have happened in D&D.

21
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,448
Rym: well think about that encounter in D&D.

22
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:27,517
Rym: Alright burning wheel.

23
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:29,787
Rym: someone shot guys with an arrow.

24
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:34,707
Rym: now He's on the ground bleeding to death and permanently crippled because it went through his lung.

25
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:38,146
Rym: D&D I take 1d6 damage and keep going.

26
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,793
Scott: yep Burning wheel.

27
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:49,949
Rym: so awesome, but yeah the one best thing beyond all that the visigoths less be left behind one vanilla cream soda with cane sugar in it.

28
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:51,967
Rym: Drinking it right now.

29
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:54,368
Scott: Okay, I don't really care.

30
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,109
Rym: All right, so you don't like the good things in life.

31
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:58,335
Scott: Do you mean the poison?

32
00:01:58,616 --> 00:01:58,918
Scott: all right.

33
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:01,350
Rym: so a delicious creamy soda made with the finest?

34
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,829
Rym: Madagascan Bourbon vanilla beans?

35
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,457
Scott: Yeah I'm sure business.

36
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:07,859
Scott: No.

37
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,250
Scott: It's not it's it's mostly marketing.

38
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:17,029
Rym: I'm sorry that you cannot enjoy the wonders of sparkling water cane sugar juice and vanilla.

39
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,712
Rym: yeah I'm sorry.

40
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:19,217
Scott: I can only enjoy things that are real.

41
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:23,130
Scott: and you know the label on something doesn't suddenly make me think it's so great.

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,315
Rym: It's not so much the label.

43
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:27,489
Rym: It's the fact that it's sugar water with vanilla extract in it.

44
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,979
Scott: Yeah, you could just take sugar water, but then I'll extract.

45
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,490
Scott: you don't need to get fancy sparkling water.

46
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,313
Scott: That's all bullshit.

47
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:33,835
Scott: Just made up.

48
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:38,210
Rym: um Scott sparkling water doesn't mean anything other than being carbonated.

49
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:40,000
Rym: I can't easily carbonate.

50
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:41,750
Scott: carbonating immediately makes things worse.

51
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:48,555
Rym: I'm sorry that your mouth for whatever reason can't handle the carbonation not even that carbon dioxide Poison.

52
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:49,682
Scott: not good for you.

53
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:50,850
Scott: your body gets rid of it.

54
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,613
Scott: Why would you put it in?

55
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:52,877
Scott: you get all that goes out.

56
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,025
Rym: if it goes in the stomach doesn't hurt you still not good Why not?

57
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:00,724
Scott: Why wait what what's good about it?

58
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:01,689
Rym: What it tastes really good?

59
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,335
Scott: Carbon dioxide is days like anything.

60
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:05,820
Rym: it had the sparkling.

61
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,064
Rym: this of it in a drink does?

62
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:08,167
Scott: no it doesn't.

63
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,345
Rym: uh I Submit that it was the flavor of it.

64
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:18,230
Rym: then Scott I submit that in a double-blind test people could taste the difference between carbonated and non carbonated anything.

65
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:19,890
Scott: Yeah, cuz they would feel it.

66
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,332
Scott: It wasn't it?

67
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:21,096
Scott: not a taste?

68
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:23,770
Scott: you if you had no taste buds you can see guys the difference.

69
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:28,338
Rym: You know smell is a large component If not the primary component of taste.

70
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,070
Scott: so I would argue that a carbon dioxide doesn't smell like anything.

71
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,510
Scott: So I would argue that a person with no olfactory nerves and no tongue could tell the difference.

72
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:38,089
Scott: I would argue it is a matter of feel.

73
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:43,266
Rym: I would argue that why limit the idea of taste to just one or two senses?

74
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:48,786
Rym: because because then Like something or don't like something because the texture the texture is just feeling.

75
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:51,587
Scott: yeah, you know I've never really understood those texture.

76
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:57,109
Scott: people I mean oh I guess the only thing where I don't like it because of the texture is like tentacles or something other than that.

77
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,433
Scott: Textures of foods.

78
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:03,870
Scott: really don't bother or not bother me you do understand it because you just said you understand it only that only the tentacles.

79
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,165
Rym: Cuz they're too chewy so someone else might have that feeling about something else.

80
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:09,410
Scott: Yeah, they stupid.

81
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:12,539
Rym: Okay, so captain tech news.

82
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,764
Rym: What do you have in the tech news?

83
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:14,185
Scott: I don't know.

84
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:15,410
Scott: we haven't talked about tech yet.

85
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,214
Rym: Shall I go first.

86
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,286
Scott: let's try to talk about tech for the rest of the show all right.

87
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:18,829
Scott: I got it going.

88
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:19,593
Scott: I'll go first.

89
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,978
Rym: all right cuz I got this here.

90
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,450
Rym: I just read this article, but it's the funniest thing.

91
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:36,990
Rym: you know I got this new job a while ago and I Actually do work at this job like for real and as a result I don't just sit there surfing the internet for you know one day out of the week.

92
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:39,444
Rym: So I actually don't get to read the news until I get home.

93
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:40,450
Scott: usually no man.

94
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:49,567
Rym: So uh I get home, and I see an article student given detention for using Firefox totally believable and I click on this.

95
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:55,206
Rym: and it is in fact a Piece of paper that has been scanned into the internet for us all to peruse.

96
00:04:55,647 --> 00:05:01,125
Rym: and the I think the important part is Incident description today in class a big black bar.

97
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:07,450
Rym: That's kind of a weird name, but Had a program launched called Firefox or Fox fire dot execute.

98
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:15,849
Rym: I had told big black box to close the program and to resume work But he told me that it was just a different browser, and that he was doing his work.

99
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:22,697
Rym: I had given him two warnings, but he insisted that he was it was just a better Browser and that he wasn't doing anything wrong.

100
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,006
Rym: I then issued him detention.

101
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:29,424
Rym: mm-hmm Yeah, big black box should have been using that Fox fire program.

102
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:30,328
Scott: No not at all.

103
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:35,110
Scott: well I can say about this is first of all you want to tell the rest of the story or alright.

104
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:37,740
Rym: So the rest of the story here cuz alright.

105
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,170
Rym: That's a slash dot article, but you know how slash dot is.

106
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,470
Rym: It's not quite to the dig level of you know every single headline being complete and utter bullshit.

107
00:05:47,393 --> 00:05:55,309
Rym: but at the same time Slash dot has been known to Redact or perhaps update a story a couple hours after it comes up.

108
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,201
Scott: I'm sure not something which dig is incapable of doing sure enough there.

109
00:05:59,241 --> 00:05:59,401
Rym: Well.

110
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:02,410
Rym: Why would they bother fixing the Ron Paul article?

111
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,623
Rym: That's obviously incorrect when they can just have another Ron Paul article.

112
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:07,109
Scott: No good call.

113
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:16,230
Rym: So uh it's updated here And one of these cool officials was nice enough to contact us us being slash dot and let us know that this is a hoax.

114
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:21,364
Rym: If you were planning on calling the school, please refrain from doing so now.

115
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,130
Rym: This is where it gets interesting.

116
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:37,196
Rym: They know it's a hoax because the school said show said so and I'm not gonna read these schools claim that it's a hoax but Looking at it basically their claim is Doesn't really contradict.

117
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:38,922
Rym: What was in this detention letter.

118
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:47,327
Rym: They say it was modified, but I Kind of believe that this student was given a detention for something very similar to what was described in this letter.

119
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:54,412
Scott: well for me You know basically the the fact that the school said this and it is something the school definitely said because it's on the school's website Right.

120
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:55,556
Scott: so it is an actual.

121
00:06:55,677 --> 00:07:02,981
Scott: You know notice from the school and basically this Specific incident of the you know detention for Firefox.

122
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,050
Scott: I have no clue whether it's true or not or how much of it's true.

123
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,258
Scott: It's completely uncertain.

124
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,150
Scott: That's that doesn't matter.

125
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:15,147
Scott: What does matter is that this sort of thing does happen because it was happening how.

126
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:20,410
Rym: I was in high school I got we got to be careful here because that is a dangerous slippery slope.

127
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:22,890
Rym: That's an argument that can get you in a lot of trouble.

128
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:38,309
Rym: I mean remember a while ago when there was a noose hung outside of a firehouse somewhere and someone was there's a big racism thing and Then it turned out later that that was a hoax that it was completely made up and that the person who was complaining had actually Put the noose there himself

129
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:39,540
Scott: uh-huh,

130
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:46,908
Rym: and The people who had been so vocal about it including this person basically said yeah, well that one was a hoax,

131
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:47,109
Scott: but

132
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:51,190
Rym: And then they just continued with their argument as though nothing had happened

133
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:51,953
Scott: Uh-huh,

134
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:54,040
Rym: so yeah, you got to be careful there right, but

135
00:07:54,342 --> 00:08:01,580
Scott: I don't need to be careful because when I was in high school I got I got my circum anecdotal evidence here when I was in high school.

136
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:13,117
Scott: the school basically had a system where if you Like added any application to the system any of the desktop computers in the school or ran any Exe's that like weren't on this list.

137
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,130
Scott: like someone who did something at the school will I get an email about it, right?

138
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,668
Scott: So like this school probably has one of these stupid systems where someone runs an exe.

139
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,646
Scott: Right that is because how else would the teacher know Firefox study exceed Fox fire dot exe exactly?

140
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:28,148
Rym: how do we know?

141
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:28,770
Rym: is Firefox?

142
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,835
Scott: I know right it could have been Fox fire some other program, but anyway You know.

143
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:41,650
Scott: this kid probably you know downloaded Firefox ran You know the exe and the teacher you know probably got a little notice on their computer.

144
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,146
Scott: That was like someone is running an exe that isn't one of the ones on their computer.

145
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:46,632
Scott: go punish them You know.

146
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:58,450
Scott: so the teacher went over and of course the teacher is incompetent and knows nothing about computers Just doing what the computer tells them to and this student is being all not doing what the teacher says they must be bad.

147
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:20,363
Rym: Well, I I would go one step further And I think that it's a fairly more specific situation because if you read what the school said their statement about how The reports blogs and other sources on the internet indicating that big string student was assigned detention for using Firefox Instead of Internet Explorer are untrue and based on the fake letter Detention is assigned in our schools after appropriate warnings are given.

148
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:29,389
Rym: if students continue to engage in Non-academic activities or fail to follow a teacher's directive during class time Discipline can and will be assigned.

149
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:31,462
Rym: now I don't think we need another discipline.

150
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:38,222
Rym: reading, but I Think what happened the real story my guess here total guess.

151
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:38,885
Rym: you can't.

152
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:41,515
Rym: uh libel me because I'm guessing I don't know if this is true.

153
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:43,183
Rym: Well slander because it's not written down yet.

154
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:44,530
Scott: It's educated guess though.

155
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:53,500
Rym: Yes, it is an educated guess in my not so professional, but completely opinion istic opinion But based on what real life experience, but yet an opinion nonetheless.

156
00:09:53,641 --> 00:10:01,190
Rym: yep this kid whoever he is you know big black box Was on the computer and he know he knows how to use a computer.

157
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,390
Rym: He's probably in a computer class or doing work in a class that involves computers.

158
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:13,429
Rym: But like pretty much any kid in middle school or high school Who is ever in a class with a computer teacher in a middle school or high school?

159
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,370
Rym: The assignment was probably something completely stupid, and he was bored.

160
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:21,230
Rym: So he just went to myspace or something and he happened to be using Firefox.

161
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,223
Rym: So a teacher comes over and says you're not doing your work.

162
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:29,039
Rym: kid gives her guff She gives him detention and to make it all formal.

163
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:33,008
Rym: You know he was running Firefox an unauthorized application, and that's just the.

164
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:38,650
Rym: the Specific legal is rule that he broke, but really he was just mouthing off and not doing his work.

165
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:43,330
Scott: Yeah, I get the feeling it's more like one of these systems that tells the teachers when they're running something.

166
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,120
Rym: I'm almost certain that I am because how well.

167
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,508
Scott: so this incompetent teacher know about Firefox?

168
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:59,890
Rym: seriously She probably got the someone else in the school to write it up Or maybe the letter was altered a bit And he was just trying to capitalize on the fact that it's Firefox because he knows that these slash-shot people freak out about it.

169
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,729
Rym: No, maybe look at they make very clear that he was given this detention for not following the teachers rules.

170
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:06,556
Scott: right now Here's the thing.

171
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:07,364
Scott: here's the thing right.

172
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:18,708
Scott: if You're not following a teacher's instructions, but you're right, and you oh You're up, then you should be rewarded in the teacher should be punished in fact fired.

173
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:21,543
Rym: the difference Here is that it depends on what I mean.

174
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,453
Rym: if he's supposed to do an assignment He's not doing it.

175
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,441
Scott: I guess the teacher you have evidence that he did it.

176
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:25,802
Scott: innocence.

177
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:26,445
Scott: I'll proven guilty.

178
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:31,112
Rym: uh well one That's not true in school, but beside me beside Otherwise.

179
00:11:31,132 --> 00:11:33,079
Scott: the school's unjust if it teaches all.

180
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,536
Rym: the teacher wouldn't be doing anything wrong if the teacher assigned work And the kid just refused to do it.

181
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:40,107
Rym: because they can grade him accordingly punish him accordingly.

182
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:40,890
Rym: It's all in the rules.

183
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,594
Rym: That's all cool.

184
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:45,974
Rym: Yeah, so uh so much for your argument You can't put.

185
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:49,130
Scott: well the only way you can punish a kid for not doing work is give him a bad grade.

186
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:51,498
Rym: Uh no who says that you can punish?

187
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,990
Rym: you can have rules for you could say anyone doesn't do their homework gets detention.

188
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,536
Rym: That's bullshit, but a lot of schools.

189
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:56,918
Rym: Do that.

190
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:57,359
Rym: Well.

191
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:57,881
Scott: It's bullshit.

192
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:00,010
Scott: those schools are shitty, okay?

193
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:09,030
Rym: I think the the greater issue here since Scott seems to want to talk more about the the instance of dealing with Having teachers who are incompetent using computers.

194
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:10,974
Rym: If a teacher.

195
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:15,110
Rym: I'm of the opinion that if a teacher in you know a public school in the u.s.

196
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:25,702
Rym: is going to use a computer at all in their lectures in their stuff if they're gonna let students use computers in the classroom if They're not at least as competent as the students at computers.

197
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:27,830
Rym: They should not be allowed to use computers in the classroom.

198
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,692
Scott: Yeah That's what I'm.

199
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:36,485
Rym: they're only going to lose the respect of the students and not be able to effectively teach Pretty much immediately and going to just completely discredit themselves as teachers.

200
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:43,750
Scott: as far as those kids are concerned Yeah, I mean it would be the imagine if like some like eight-year-old kid had to teach calculus to calculus professors.

201
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:44,861
Scott: That's what it's like.

202
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:50,810
Scott: you know the The calculus professor is gonna goof off and do calculus together while the eight-year-old kid is like.

203
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:57,926
Rym: I was in middle school, and we had a computer lab and I. it was mandatory.

204
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:01,078
Rym: you had to take computer class Every year in middle school.

205
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:02,668
Rym: There's computer class one two and three.

206
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:03,493
Scott: yep that's what we had.

207
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:17,330
Rym: also, and I remember sitting down a computer class and Computer class basically involved the teacher Giving you a printed out word document or works document or possibly and a spreadsheet yep.

208
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:23,808
Rym: And by the end of the class period you had to duplicate that on the computer, and then email it to him.

209
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,570
Rym: yep And being smart one I could do it in like five minutes.

210
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,815
Scott: I did like 30 seconds.

211
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:36,105
Scott: usually they were really long and I had to type a bunch of ours weren't so long But what they would do is they make you do all sorts of different stuff like.

212
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,568
Scott: it would be pretty short But you had to bold this part and italics that part.

213
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:49,873
Rym: From what I hear from kids this sort of methodology and teaching about computers is still pretty much the predominant way of teaching computers in School.

214
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:55,070
Rym: it is I think that it is 100% ineffective and will do nothing but harm kids in the future.

215
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,206
Rym: I think it's just an awful way to teach and anyone who does that is not qualified to teach kids at all.

216
00:13:59,488 --> 00:13:59,628
Scott: nope

217
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:17,780
Rym: but Beside all that being even smarter than just you know doing it quickly I Noticed that I could log into the computer locally instead of having to go through the you know net system yep, and If I got in locally I could do some shenanigans and mount network drives.

218
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:26,566
Rym: and that on those network drives were in fact the completed Assignments and the assignments that he had made and printed and then saved in his own personal directory.

219
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:30,177
Rym: that was not in any way protected Yeah, and basically every day.

220
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:34,009
Rym: I would just go to his directory get the file and then send it back to him.

221
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:41,575
Rym: Yeah, I did this for three years awesome, and he'd always come over and say like he Knew I was cheating.

222
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,610
Rym: he was so sure that I was cheating cuz no one can type that fast.

223
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:54,110
Rym: he didn't see me typing that much, but He could never figure it out And if he found me probably expelled me or something because the rules for messing with the computers were crazy.

224
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:58,530
Scott: The rules at the school right at my high school for like messing with the computers are crazy.

225
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,850
Scott: It's like if you're messing with the computers bleh bleh bleh hacking.

226
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,226
Rym: I was caught yeah hacking one tagging.

227
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,124
Scott: basically They had a desk the.

228
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:06,513
Scott: basically their Security was.

229
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:15,130
Scott: they had some sort of novell system on top of Windows where if you logged in as a student account There were no icons that you couldn't open the start menu, and you couldn't go to start run.

230
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:19,569
Scott: But if you pushed like f3 the find file dialog would show up.

231
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:32,190
Scott: So you would search for like star dot star right you'd right-click on a folder and say explore Explorer would show up and you could explore every single directory and run any executable you could find and do anything you wanted.

232
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:33,741
Rym: I went one step beyond that.

233
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:35,110
Rym: I just brought boot disks to school.

234
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:43,344
Scott: I could even run the novell like you know the novell Administration program and I could administer the school's network as a student account.

235
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:48,744
Scott: all the only security was that there was you know No icon for it on the desktop or in the start I think the best thing was.

236
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:52,928
Rym: in one day I showed my English teacher how I could just look at all the grades any time and change him if I wanted.

237
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:55,826
Rym: there's no way She could know yeah, and she was like you're lucky.

238
00:15:55,927 --> 00:16:04,347
Rym: I'm not Incredibly stupid or I probably would have expelled you and called the police And then she told me to never show any other teacher that again and pretend we never had that conversation.

239
00:16:04,387 --> 00:16:05,352
Scott: see that's the thing Is it?

240
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:05,975
Scott: it's just so.

241
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:07,787
Scott: uh we'll talk about it more later.

242
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:13,468
Rym: Yeah, well I'll state my controversial thing because I'd love to have anyone argue this against me.

243
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:15,107
Rym: all right I'm of the opinion.

244
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:23,989
Rym: now There is one allowance And I think the allowance is purely for people who are already teaching as in you know people who are older who?

245
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:36,412
Rym: Started teaching before the modern era and when I say the modern era at this point I mean like the last two years because the world in terms of technology and the internet has changed a lot in the last two Years.

246
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:48,106
Rym: yep, I'm of the mind that going forward Anyone who is teaching children at all and anyone who's a teacher in a school for primary education secondary education What have you?

247
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,568
Rym: Who is not computer proficient as in?

248
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,986
Rym: Basically computer proficient able to do the things that people should be able to do on a computer.

249
00:16:57,026 --> 00:17:01,230
Rym: computer literate Should not be allowed to be a teacher because computer literacy is literacy.

250
00:17:01,673 --> 00:17:03,306
Scott: I think I'm gonna take it a step further.

251
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:07,555
Scott: you ready There's some of this sort of like this dogma Especially in Western schools.

252
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:08,779
Scott: right that it's sort of like.

253
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:21,415
Scott: you don't even question it because it's so basic that the subjects are English math Science and you know social studies reading writing arithmetic exactly and no one even dodgeball nobody even thinks about changing that right It's not even it's like.

254
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:22,280
Scott: it's like a structure.

255
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,084
Scott: That's just accepted.

256
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:24,150
Rym: people do all the time.

257
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,662
Rym: It depends on what kind of school you go to.

258
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:26,347
Scott: yeah, I know.

259
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:29,950
Scott: but well I guess there are some crazy schools You know that are pretty cool that do stuff that I mean.

260
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:36,267
Rym: I think that the general idea of teaching now and a lot of high schools and middle schools You know there's English and my school was lucky.

261
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:36,710
Rym: We broke it.

262
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:40,970
Rym: We broke up language and literature separately and most people have to take a foreign language.

263
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:44,910
Rym: Then you have the sciences and they pretty much break that up into physics biology.

264
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,079
Scott: Not until high school did they break them up.

265
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:58,440
Rym: Oh, yeah, but even then like there's still science And then there's social studies, and then later you get you know history and they specialize and all that yep And I think they do an okay job of that because we had computers.

266
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,570
Rym: the only problem with having the technology was that one.

267
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:05,754
Rym: They were trying to teach computer literacy and technology Separately.

268
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:12,341
Rym: when really I feel like every single subject in a school Requires computer literacy means you're in English.

269
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:14,670
Rym: I think I'd be typing everything on a computer.

270
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,820
Rym: Yeah, if you're writing things out by hand that something's wrong.

271
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:18,944
Scott: pretty much.

272
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:20,730
Scott: computer should be part of every class.

273
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:31,722
Scott: But there should also be computer class where you learn how a Computer works and you know bits and bytes and how to write Basic and all that stuff and they should actually teach you that it should be.

274
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:35,136
Scott: they should have as much time in that class as You do in English class.

275
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,428
Scott: it should be a full subject along with all the others.

276
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:39,298
Scott: the fifth So I wouldn't even say just computers.

277
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,465
Rym: I would call it like technology.

278
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:42,356
Scott: Oh, yes everything You should learn how to like.

279
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,852
Scott: you know solder circuit boards of course You know what.

280
00:18:45,113 --> 00:18:53,525
Rym: I'm also of the mind that kids in middle school in high school should take classes on How banking works how loans work how credit cards and the economy work?

281
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:58,350
Scott: Yeah, they definitely need because in high school They told that there was an egg one economics class, and it did not teach you that stuff.

282
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:03,090
Rym: The only reason I knew about credit cards cuz my parents got me one when I was 16, and they said how it worked.

283
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:07,351
Scott: Yeah, there really needs to see that stuff should be part of home economics, but there oh,

284
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:23,179
Rym: you know what home economics for me was sitting in a room full of Barely sentient fellow classmates one of whom stuck needles in the teachers food one day And yet was not expelled because they decided that he was special And it wasn't like a special ed class.

285
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:24,003
Rym: this was just normal.

286
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:27,829
Rym: it required home economics for everyone And there were fights in the class all the time.

287
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:35,656
Rym: I was kicked out of the class eventually because I was trying to get kicked out because I was kind of afraid of those kids On a visceral.

288
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,043
Rym: wow they're trying to poison the teacher.

289
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,089
Rym: I don't know what they're gonna do to me.

290
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:46,004
Rym: Yeah, but we learned how to cook sausage And I sewed together a cube and that was the extent of it.

291
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:48,090
Scott: I in my home economics class the only ones they ever took.

292
00:19:48,090 --> 00:20:01,622
Scott: Were in middle school, and I cooked Apple strawberry pie with some kids and Then I sewed some boxers, and then I sewed an alligator Jimmy Dean sausage the same sausage I had cooked at home the day before.

293
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:02,990
Rym: I cut it into slices.

294
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:07,690
Rym: I put it on a frying pan, and then I sewed a cube and stuffed it with stuff.

295
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,059
Scott: Yep, I made an alligator so much cooler all right anyway.

296
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:12,007
Scott: I let's move on to different news here.

297
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:12,509
Scott: all right.

298
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:18,389
Scott: Okay, the story here is did the NSA put a secret backdoor in the new encryption standard?

299
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:19,813
Rym: well I didn't read this article.

300
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:20,254
Rym: so about.

301
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:21,077
Rym: is the answer yes.

302
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:25,930
Scott: Well, maybe most likely possibly that there's actually significant evidence, right?

303
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,097
Scott: Basically, here's how it goes down.

304
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:34,870
Scott: right the NSA puts out a document You know some crazy government thing that says these are gonna be the encryption standards, right?

305
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,810
Scott: You know we're gonna use this one in this one in this one in this one, and there's a you know different.

306
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,834
Scott: There's different ways.

307
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:41,560
Scott: It's mostly random number.

308
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,397
Scott: generation is what we're talking about here, and there's many different ways of Generating random numbers right.

309
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:49,309
Scott: so there's like you can do it with.

310
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:53,810
Scott: You know you could do one with hash functions to generate random numbers.

311
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,830
Scott: You can do one with ciphers right, but and there's one that uses elliptic curves, right?

312
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:05,881
Scott: And the one that does elliptic curves the one that the NSA says to use is dual Underscore EC underscore DRBG.

313
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:07,590
Scott: all right now.

314
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:09,656
Scott: The other ones are fine.

315
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:17,064
Scott: You know they know all about the other random jump number generating things They know how they work, and they're cool, but this dual ER DRBG.

316
00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:17,766
Scott: Whatever it is.

317
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:20,292
Scott: I'll just call it the dual EC.

318
00:21:20,332 --> 00:21:22,338
Scott: from now on right it.

319
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:39,482
Scott: It's an elliptic curve random number generator a well-understood Technology here and some guys studied it and first of all it's slower and shittier than other elliptic curve random number J. Awesome Okay, second of all they've noticed a slight bias right now.

320
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:42,570
Scott: the slight bias doesn't in itself doesn't really prove anything.

321
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:48,936
Rym: Well, yeah, because random number generation to make truly random numbers is Effectively almost impossible right.

322
00:21:49,177 --> 00:22:00,390
Scott: and this this small bias isn't a big enough bias to make the algorithms You know pointless is just a slight bias, and there's actually a workaround in the standard and how to avoid the issue.

323
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:03,229
Scott: But it is a slight cause for a concern, right?

324
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:10,142
Scott: Anyway the fact that there was a slight bias You know makes the crazy encryption guys the cryptographers be like whoa.

325
00:22:10,183 --> 00:22:13,495
Scott: we're staying clear away from that when we got this other one That doesn't have a slight bias right.

326
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,041
Scott: there's a whiff of a problem.

327
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,230
Scott: We're gonna stay clear right now.

328
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,637
Scott: Here's the worst one in the.

329
00:22:19,777 --> 00:22:24,550
Scott: in the document that describes the standard early on there's some constants that you have to use.

330
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,232
Scott: It's like here's the.

331
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:26,878
Scott: is this constant in this other constant?

332
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:30,270
Scott: right, but it doesn't tell you where these constants come from at all.

333
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:31,977
Scott: It just these are the constants.

334
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:32,319
Scott: use them.

335
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:33,163
Scott: Okay.

336
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:34,469
Scott: We use those constants, right?

337
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:42,684
Scott: some guy proved mathematically that There are some set of secret numbers.

338
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:48,389
Scott: all right and If someone had these because the you know because of these constants, right?

339
00:22:49,271 --> 00:23:00,124
Scott: He was able to prove mathematically if there's a set of secret numbers, and if you had the secret numbers What you could do is you could collect 32 bytes of output

340
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:01,186
Rym: from

341
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:22,983
Scott: the random number generator Combine it with the secret numbers and then you would be if you would know everything that the random number generator was gonna do from There on out all right, so if you have the secret numbers it this particular random number generating algorithm You know What it's gonna do and you it's totally broken and not secure in any way.

342
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,110
Scott: the question is the the only.

343
00:23:25,693 --> 00:23:29,110
Scott: So there is a back door into this random number generator.

344
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,119
Scott: The question is does the NSA have those numbers?

345
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,084
Scott: did anyone bother to figure out the numbers?

346
00:23:34,305 --> 00:23:39,550
Scott: because it's it's ludicrously impossible To just figure them out, but whoever made the constants?

347
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:44,264
Scott: You know the constants that are in the paper that are unexplained where those constants came from.

348
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:51,807
Scott: if whoever made those Constants when they were doing the math to come up with those could have easily also gotten the secret numbers.

349
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:59,658
Rym: now Basically, I'm always of the mind that if ever I find out that Encryption or anything that I use is compromised.

350
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,728
Rym: I abandon it immediately unless there's no alternative.

351
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:14,850
Scott: Yep Now here's the thing is that Just now recently Microsoft Vista Windows Vista has added this algorithm as an option.

352
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:25,509
Scott: I know they say it's not on by default, but you can turn it on if you want and I don't know there must be how to use online like how to turn it on or how to turn it off or whatever.

353
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:30,350
Scott: but Yeah, basically you do not want to be using this random number generator.

354
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:34,281
Scott: No Your keys or anything your SSLs or anything.

355
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:38,890
Scott: you basically don't want to use this random number generator at all for anything Even if it's not a matter of security.

356
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:48,053
Rym: Well, I have to read more before I form my because you know, I have opinions on things But whenever you know my I guess professional opinion like as an IT professional What is my opinion on this?

357
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:57,278
Rym: but my hunch opinion is that this is in fact intentional just because the odds of something like this Being so perfectly there.

358
00:24:57,761 --> 00:24:59,408
Rym: Yeah, that's that's kind of out there.

359
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:04,806
Scott: Yeah, basically if you're smart don't use this random number generator at all.

360
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:06,050
Scott: Just completely ignore it.

361
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:08,398
Scott: The problem is this is like the government standard.

362
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:12,531
Scott: that's in you know, the National Institute of Standards and T Whatever.

363
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:12,792
Scott: What's it?

364
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:15,021
Rym: Yeah nice time time, right?

365
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,606
Rym: I use them a lot.

366
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,435
Scott: Yeah, right this is their thing.

367
00:25:18,495 --> 00:25:23,235
Scott: like these are the standard random number trainers use these and What the the elliptic hurt.

368
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:28,973
Scott: they the other ones they've you know suggested are okay, but the elliptic curve one they suggest is shit It's slow.

369
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:30,037
Scott: It's insecure.

370
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:30,981
Scott: It has a back door.

371
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:36,170
Scott: Even if the NSA doesn't have the keys to the back door There is a back door in it and someone has a small bias.

372
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,901
Scott: Eventually, I guess someone could figure it out.

373
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:39,666
Scott: I don't know about that.

374
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:45,707
Rym: But yeah Well, I mean, you know process is getting better and you can always throw the quantum computing will fuck everybody.

375
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,574
Scott: Yeah Regardless don't use this don't enable it and make sure that You're steering.

376
00:25:51,956 --> 00:26:05,399
Scott: steer clear of the dual EC DRBG random number generator things of the day.

377
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:10,660
Rym: So you realize that in Sweden they used to drive on the left-hand side of the road.

378
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:15,040
Scott: I didn't know I was never actually aware of which side of the road Sweden drove on.

379
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,000
Rym: Well from what I can read it seems like the majority of people in the world drive on the right side of the road.

380
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,919
Rym: Yep, that's that's pretty great and that very few places bother with this crazy driving on the left-hand side of the road business.

381
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:31,286
Rym: Well, Japan drives in the left right and Britain and Britain, but there's a lot of people There's always that.

382
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:39,560
Scott: from what I hear a lot of people are always advocating just switching Yeah, and that way that karma it's easier on the car manufacturers only to make cars with the wheel on one side.

383
00:26:40,243 --> 00:26:45,819
Rym: But I was thinking about that and then I you know, I suddenly realized wait a minute How the hell would you go about that?

384
00:26:46,383 --> 00:26:49,440
Scott: I mean if I had to suddenly drive on the left, that'd be pretty rough one.

385
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:57,188
Rym: I would probably crash into something because I mean especially for someone like me where I drive plus I wouldn't go buy a switched car right away.

386
00:26:57,228 --> 00:27:00,560
Scott: So I'd be driving the left side of the road in my left-hand wheel car.

387
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:03,913
Rym: Well, I'm just thinking more along the lines of all my driving instincts.

388
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:05,840
Rym: cuz think I drive so much.

389
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,629
Rym: The driving is like this this subconscious thing.

390
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,198
Rym: My brain would just go into the wrong lane and kill someone.

391
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:16,100
Scott: probably I'd have to be thinking like turn plus highway on ramps totally broken suddenly.

392
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:17,683
Rym: Oh, yeah Especially in the US.

393
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:24,848
Scott: even if like everyone went home in their driveways and then everyone went back on the road driving on the left The highways wouldn't work.

394
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:25,733
Scott: You couldn't get on and off.

395
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:26,156
Scott: It'd be back.

396
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:26,820
Rym: Yeah, that's one thing.

397
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:36,597
Rym: Well, I know we have a lot of non-us listeners and I know there are freeways in the rest of the world But I don't think you quite understand the extent to which our freeways are freeways here.

398
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:39,773
Rym: Yeah now I'm not saying that's necessarily a good thing.

399
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:54,300
Rym: But yeah but anyway, and then I really started thinking about this and then I started looking online to see if it's ever happened before and sure enough Dagen H Aka the H day not D day.

400
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:58,713
Rym: We had D day and I guess F day and G day but then H day really.

401
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:00,759
Scott: so they act someplace.

402
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:07,020
Rym: actually The H stands for Holger traffic, which is the Swedish word for right-hand traffic.

403
00:28:07,544 --> 00:28:09,820
Rym: So this day was on September 3rd.

404
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:21,940
Rym: That was a long time ago and basically from what I can gather Sweden drove on the left which was dumb because every one of their neighbors drove on the right.

405
00:28:22,061 --> 00:28:24,290
Scott: And so what did you do at the border before Dagen H?

406
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,480
Rym: at the border users you swapped?

407
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,703
Rym: Oh, that sucks.

408
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:35,779
Rym: And also most people in Sweden had cars with the wheel on the left side because Right side right hand wheel cars are not that common, huh?

409
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:41,920
Rym: So it was pretty much just stupid that Sweden was driving on the left and Sweden realized that and for a long time there.

410
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:51,700
Scott: It must have caused a lot of trouble to not just with Swedish people going to other countries and having to switch at the border But people from but like, you know, Norway come into Sweden crash because they had to switch on the wrong side of the road.

411
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,343
Scott: They're not used to it.

412
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:55,355
Rym: So this is the story and it's on Wikipedia.

413
00:28:55,375 --> 00:29:03,620
Rym: You can read it of Exactly how they pulled this business off and basically everyone go home then everyone can drive again.

414
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,084
Rym: They've been thinking about it for 40 years 40 years.

415
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:12,679
Rym: for 40 years this idea had been voted down and people kept voting to keep driving nonetheless.

416
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:16,066
Rym: and then in 1963 four years before they did it.

417
00:29:16,106 --> 00:29:32,420
Rym: They said alright, we're gonna do it and they established the Stottins Hoeger traffic commission Mm-hmm, which was if you remember Hoeger traffic, it was the Hoeger traffic commission Uh-huh, and it was the state was basically the government entity that was going to oversee the change.

418
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:35,460
Scott: You pretty much need to make a whole new government entity to do something like that.

419
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,528
Scott: Now as long as you remember which the u.s.

420
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:43,322
Scott: Never remembers to do to remove the government entity when it's done Now it was.

421
00:29:43,744 --> 00:30:01,679
Rym: it was a four-year effort not so much in terms of fixing the infrastructure but four years of doing psychology and Advertising to remind people that this was gonna happen Mmm, and then we should do some of that for our you know, turning off the broadcast TV.

422
00:30:02,742 --> 00:30:12,543
Rym: So as the day neared apparently Every single intersection in Sweden was given an extra set of poles with an extra set of traffic signals wrapped in plastic Uh-huh.

423
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:28,093
Rym: So they basically built an entire parallel network of traffic signals Everywhere and they put a parallel set of lines were painted on to every single road with white paint and then covered with black Tape, uh-huh because previously they use these yellow lines.

424
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:29,419
Rym: So they're switching to white lines, too.

425
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:37,479
Rym: So basically they built an entire parallel infrastructure and then on Sunday December 3rd They took all the tape off and took all the plastic.

426
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:42,036
Rym: All non-essential traffic was banned from the roads for five hours from 1 a.m.

427
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:42,297
Rym: To 6 a.m.

428
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:43,463
Scott: It's a.

429
00:30:43,483 --> 00:30:48,352
Rym: so only ambulances and fire engines and whatnot Yep, and any vehicle on the roads had to follow special rules.

430
00:30:48,673 --> 00:30:53,173
Scott: and then at 4 45 a.m So most people stayed home because they were worried about dying every.

431
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:54,619
Rym: well who's gonna be on the road that early?

432
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:54,900
Rym: anyway?

433
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:55,483
Scott: I know right.

434
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:01,740
Rym: so at 4 45 every single vehicle on the road had to come to a complete stop And wait five minutes.

435
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:09,820
Rym: then carefully and slowly Everyone switch sides and then at five o'clock traffic is allowed to proceed.

436
00:31:10,622 --> 00:31:15,580
Scott: So wait, so when did like people all around the country run around tearing tape and plastic office?

437
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,625
Scott: Yes, like whose job was that?

438
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:18,728
Scott: Did they have the government?

439
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,114
Scott: They had government people ever there?

440
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:25,167
Scott: also probably the best thing How did they have so many government people everywhere?

441
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:27,796
Rym: because Sweden is smart about that sort of thing.

442
00:31:27,957 --> 00:31:33,469
Rym: one socialism alright - It's something that why can't they the u.s.

443
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:33,770
Rym: Do it.

444
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,326
Scott: We have so much money so much power We don't know to the left side of the road.

445
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:41,042
Rym: How come How come when the u.s.

446
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:55,125
Rym: Wants to do something we don't just do what Sweden did which is Get a bunch of smart people pay what it costs to do it right and do it because they're stupid yes, and people don't like change and It just read the rest of the story.

447
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:55,849
Rym: It's kind of crazy.

448
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:03,000
Rym: But my favorite thing in this Wikipedia article There's a picture of Stockholm shortly before traffic resumed and it's utter chaos.

449
00:32:05,002 --> 00:32:06,520
Rym: It's just cars just kind of pointed.

450
00:32:07,483 --> 00:32:07,927
Scott: Now, right.

451
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,580
Scott: So how long did it take before it was all good?

452
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,223
Scott: I don't know.

453
00:32:10,444 --> 00:32:10,767
Scott: cuz I mean.

454
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:12,480
Scott: now they're driving on the right and everything's cool, right?

455
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,220
Rym: Actually, there were fewer traffic accidents then that day than any other day.

456
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:24,520
Rym: Well, because everyone's going all carefully there weren't accidents But people were probably all like well or the speed limit for like months after it just until people got used to it.

457
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:31,617
Rym: I would probably obey a lower speed limit if something like that reason Oh, you know slow I'd be driving for like a year after something like that happened.

458
00:32:31,757 --> 00:32:34,731
Scott: Yeah, probably But I'd be like every intersection.

459
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:41,359
Scott: I'd be thinking real hard like, okay No Right turn on red left turn on red and stop wait for the right turn signal.

460
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:44,836
Rym: there I do have to point out that in a nation like the United States.

461
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,875
Rym: I Believe that doing something like this today would be effectively impossible.

462
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:52,500
Scott: Yeah, this is too big.

463
00:32:52,824 --> 00:32:58,712
Rym: It's not just that it's too big It's that our infrastructure is for cars is so advanced and so specialized.

464
00:32:58,953 --> 00:33:01,660
Rym: now advanced is relative because it's invented someplace.

465
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,506
Rym: It's advanced.

466
00:33:02,587 --> 00:33:03,614
Scott: It's it's special.

467
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:06,084
Scott: Well It's special.

468
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:19,759
Rym: our freeway network a modern freeways in the u.s Like the ones that are in Texas or even like in the Midwest most of the Midwest and even the major ones in You know New York area that don't go through New York City.

469
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:37,580
Rym: Our marvels of engineering and even the ones that are in like are totally screwed up like i-95 near New York City or I 287 near New York City Yeah, or any of those Despite I mean that's just a matter of there's too many people on the road.

470
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:41,940
Rym: The fact remains that there's still marvels of engineering and the fact that they work at all is kind of crazy.

471
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:50,970
Rym: But they're so specialized for the way traffic goes that you'd basically have to rebuild every freaking goddamn Onramp in this country over the course of 20 or 30 years.

472
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:51,351
Rym: Yep.

473
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:52,897
Rym: So yeah, okay.

474
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:53,619
Rym: This is pretty cool.

475
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:55,619
Scott: All right, you like Star Wars toys room.

476
00:33:56,843 --> 00:34:02,480
Rym: You know when I was a kid and I like Star Wars But there weren't Star Wars toys except for the old ones that were valuable.

477
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:05,079
Rym: I wanted nothing more than Star Wars toys.

478
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:11,188
Scott: Yeah I see when I was a kid like I kind of knew what Star Wars was but I didn't really get into it like I Got into a little bit later than everyone else.

479
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:13,360
Scott: Like all the other kids were like kindergarten first grade.

480
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,386
Scott: They were Star Warsing it up.

481
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:17,504
Scott: I wasn't Star Warsing it till like a few years after that I don't know when it was.

482
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:21,340
Rym: but one day my dad sat me down and showed me Star Wars and I was in awe.

483
00:34:21,803 --> 00:34:24,040
Scott: So like my friends had Star Wars toys, you know.

484
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:29,627
Scott: But I didn't and I didn't really care because I didn't really understand like I could recognize C-3PO But I didn't know what his name was.

485
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,860
Scott: I just knew that was the gold Star Wars robot and stuff like that.

486
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,859
Scott: You know, I knew that there were lightsabers and Darth Vader, but that was it.

487
00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:35,684
Scott: I guess I knew.

488
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,960
Scott: I knew what I knew from Muppet Babies, right?

489
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,047
Scott: So Star Wars toys, I didn't have so many.

490
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:46,650
Scott: and you know if you go to buy a Star Wars toy now They make a Star Wars toy out of everything.

491
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,960
Scott: I mean even if they're not making it right now it fucking exists.

492
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,373
Scott: They got like, you know any pose any character even the most minor character.

493
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:55,260
Scott: There's a Star Wars toy for it.

494
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,395
Scott: You know every single dude like background guy number five.

495
00:34:58,435 --> 00:34:58,636
Scott: Yep.

496
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:07,000
Scott: He's got a figure you know, so There are though a few things that they have not made Star Wars toys out of and this website has pictures of them.

497
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,866
Scott: Let me let me tell you a few of them ready.

498
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:14,686
Scott: First of all, there is no Star Wars toy for the planet Alderaan But here's a picture of one.

499
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:15,910
Scott: It's just a bunch of rocks in a box.

500
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:20,975
Rym: Oh I don't know that that one's good.

501
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:24,889
Rym: But I think the Uncle Owen action figures probably the best.

502
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:28,140
Scott: Well, it's not just the uncle Owen action figure because I'm sure one of those does exist.

503
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,899
Scott: It's smoldering uncle Owen corpse and smoldering on Peru corpse action figures.

504
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,776
Scott: They are not included in the smoldering moisture farm playset.

505
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:38,740
Scott: They are sold separately.

506
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:43,654
Scott: Yeah, there's also the the dead ewok toy and the force.

507
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:44,617
Scott: actually that's all of them.

508
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:45,460
Scott: that's on this website.

509
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:46,906
Scott: The force is just an empty box.

510
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:50,159
Rym: The only problem with this thing of the day is that there aren't enough.

511
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:51,166
Scott: Yeah, they need this.

512
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:52,595
Scott: They should have made us something awful.

513
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:58,680
Scott: or perhaps You know some sort of Photoshop Friday worth 1000 like Star Wars toys that don't exist.

514
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:01,202
Rym: Maybe someone should do that Maybe.

515
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:05,640
Scott: so I want to see here people come to our forum and show us the Star Wars toys that do not exist.

516
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,310
Rym: Yeah, let's see what your Photoshop skills are.

517
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:10,839
Scott: Let's see if we can think of one right now.

518
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:12,548
Rym: So much for that.

519
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:15,064
Scott: Oh, I know Just a toy.

520
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:16,730
Scott: That's just the hole on the Death Star.

521
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,974
Scott: They have to shoot into just the hole.

522
00:36:17,994 --> 00:36:22,650
Rym: I think you're forgetting Something very important the Sarlacc.

523
00:36:23,272 --> 00:36:24,517
Scott: I think there might be a Sarlacc toy.

524
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:25,140
Scott: Let me go now.

525
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:26,946
Rym: I don't know if there is a Sarlacc toy.

526
00:36:27,147 --> 00:36:27,990
Scott: I'm looking it up, right?

527
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,297
Rym: There should be but hold on.

528
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:30,819
Scott: Hold on.

529
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:37,740
Scott: Okay, there is a Boba Fett unleashed toy that has the tentacles of the Sarlacc grabbing Boba Fett by the leg.

530
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,780
Rym: But it isn't a Sarlacc with a digestive pit.

531
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:45,559
Scott: It's a part of a Sarlacc that is and Boba Fett statue on top, huh?

532
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:47,364
Scott: Yeah, so it's close.

533
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:50,553
Scott: It's it's quite a bit of Sarlacc there, but that's all.

534
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:58,780
Rym: so yeah, this is Star Wars toy of everything Right, so I guess we can just pick right off where we left off in from my news earlier in the show.

535
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:03,899
Scott: Yeah, basically, let's start off with it with a more general view here zoom out of it, right?

536
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,924
Rym: So you have a planet?

537
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:12,020
Scott: Yeah, we know we have this country or at least this, you know many countries in the world I assume are having a similar problem.

538
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,552
Rym: Wait, are we doing the global statement that we're gonna narrow our focus and then have a thesis statement?

539
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:16,575
Rym: Maybe I'm proud.

540
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:24,600
Scott: Okay where knowledge about Technology and computers and electronics, you know is becoming more and more essential?

541
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,612
Scott: We've said it before on the show that we how many times have I said the exact words?

542
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:31,040
Rym: computer literacy is literacy.

543
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:49,218
Scott: Yes, you know it right if you are alive today and you are not literate in the language of your nation or you know The the language most used near you if you cannot read and write your life is severely limited and you you cannot progress in society and many options are unavailable to you unless you become literate.

544
00:37:49,359 --> 00:38:01,968
Scott: and In today's world if you are not technology literate It is going to hurt you almost as bad as if you are not literate in language and your you knows and I mean time Goes on that problem will only get worse.

545
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:04,960
Rym: I mean you might say well, it isn't right this second, but it's getting there.

546
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,919
Rym: I mean think about how much the how important computers and the internet got in the last five years the last ten years the last 20 years.

547
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:17,260
Rym: They're gonna change more in the next two years than they did in the last ten.

548
00:38:17,621 --> 00:38:23,640
Scott: I mean right now if you can't read and write or do simple math, you can barely even get a job at McDonald's.

549
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:26,900
Rym: You're basically relegated to hard manual labor.

550
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,576
Rym: You could be a janitor maybe no because janitors have to be able to at least read the cleaning stuff.

551
00:38:31,596 --> 00:38:33,849
Rym: They gotta know how to That's true.

552
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:42,520
Scott: I mean Yeah, so I mean, yeah think about that right the janitor if you can't read He might put out these slippery floor sign when it's the door closed sign or something.

553
00:38:42,661 --> 00:38:46,820
Rym: I think the the multiple languages plus the nice picture of a guy being killed.

554
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,560
Scott: I know that does help it does help but I'm more worried about that.

555
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,460
Rym: You know mixing let's say one kind of cleaner and another kind of cleaner, right?

556
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:03,467
Scott: So as time goes on I say in the next decade or two It's gonna get to the point where if you are not computer literate You can't even work at McDonald's because everything will be computerized at McDonald's, you know We're.

557
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:10,367
Scott: you know If everything eventually is gonna be computer controlled every job is just gonna be Controlling the computer.

558
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:12,280
Scott: is it telling the computers what to do or not?

559
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,741
Rym: Even that.

560
00:39:12,822 --> 00:39:19,500
Rym: but it's getting to the point even now where all basic jobs I mean your job is X like say my job is PR, right?

561
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,373
Rym: Well, I have to use a computer to email on my contacts because the business world runs on email now not on much else Mm-hmm.

562
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:29,080
Rym: And I have to be able to use a computer to design my PR press releases.

563
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,338
Rym: And then I gotta have to use a computer to go on the internet know where to send these press releases to check the internet buzz.

564
00:39:35,341 --> 00:39:40,240
Rym: You can't be a PR person and not know about the internet and not be able to use computers effectively.

565
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:41,553
Scott: I think about a business.

566
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:49,360
Scott: a long time ago Let's say you know and nowadays businesses sort of have two parts They have if they're if they're a manufacturing business where they make stuff, right?

567
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,153
Scott: they have a building where they make stuff and they have a building where they do business.

568
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:57,335
Scott: and the buildings where they do business are just desks with computers on them and that's it.

569
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:15,840
Scott: and Back in the day if you went to a place of business You might see like the accountants have one kind of desk with you know Sort of you know adding machines and slide rules or whatever abacus is and the the other the other couple Yeah, the other people have desks where they have lots of files and folders and everyone sort of has you know Their desk is different.

570
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,639
Scott: They everyone has to learn to use different tools for their specific job and learn different things.

571
00:40:21,223 --> 00:40:23,500
Scott: Nowadays, it's everyone is a desk of the computer.

572
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:26,852
Scott: You can't really do much if you don't know how to use the computer.

573
00:40:26,952 --> 00:40:27,796
Scott: even in the factory.

574
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:28,780
Scott: you go into the factory.

575
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,718
Scott: There's a big machine that makes things with a computer next to it that controls the machine.

576
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:39,866
Rym: Yep I mean even when I was worked at IBM the even though the low is like the menial Jobs in the factory like the ones were.

577
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:45,685
Rym: basically you would go to a machine and pick up a whole bunch of things And carry into another machine.

578
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:46,990
Rym: put him back in.

579
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:49,839
Rym: then you had to sit at a computer and do a whole bunch of stuff.

580
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:55,860
Rym: Yeah, and if you couldn't do that stuff, you didn't end up working there that long and that wasn't the most glamorous job.

581
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,153
Rym: It was pretty much the lowest man on the totem pole.

582
00:40:58,193 --> 00:40:59,320
Rym: You were paid less than the janitor.

583
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,615
Scott: Yeah, you're the guy who puts things in the machine.

584
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:07,060
Rym: That's that's a Things in the dumb machine because there were smarter machines where you had to know how to put stuff in it.

585
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:20,209
Scott: Yeah, but I mean that's basically the most unskilled You know least knowledge required job you can get in the United States is put things in the dumb machine all right, and you still need to have computer literacy for that even now to some level.

586
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:25,760
Scott: and The thing is is most people in this country, especially people who are older than us, right?

587
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,700
Scott: It's pretty much like we're pretty close to the line.

588
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,353
Scott: It's like people more than say 10 years older than us there are.

589
00:41:30,514 --> 00:41:31,660
Scott: you know, that's sort of where the line is.

590
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,368
Scott: There are many older people have learned.

591
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:39,223
Rym: I think I can put this pretty succinctly because I'm not we're not talking about like right this.

592
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:46,829
Rym: second in terms of it's not like if you're 40 and you're working in the industry and you're not super computer proficient that You're done and you're screwed.

593
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:48,237
Rym: You're probably gonna make it till retirement.

594
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:48,680
Rym: just fine.

595
00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:58,400
Rym: The problem is that people and it's not just older people a lot of people in this country And I think a lot of the problem also has to do with how these things are taught.

596
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:07,666
Rym: But we'll get to that because I think we mentioned earlier in the show It's that they separate using technology from Doing other jobs like they'll.

597
00:42:07,906 --> 00:42:22,760
Rym: they'll teach the X skill X and then independent of that They teach skill computer when really skill computer is a part of skill X. like they try to remove the computer From the English or they try to remove the computer from the math remove the computer.

598
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,980
Scott: Some schools try to do that thing where everyone gets a laptop and they try to use technology in everything.

599
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,965
Rym: It's that's a great idea.

600
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:35,346
Rym: Let's not talk about the failings of why that doesn't work, but But in principle it should be that way.

601
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:39,720
Rym: computers should be used in pretty much every aspect of education.

602
00:42:39,843 --> 00:42:49,757
Rym: Mm-hmm I mean I could see like if you're gonna have a tell like a an impromptu test I could see You know writing things by hand and this we're not saying you must type everything you must use the computer blah.

603
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:54,500
Rym: What we're saying is Computers are not a separate skill anymore.

604
00:42:54,801 --> 00:43:00,940
Rym: The separate skill of computer is IT and CS and coding and when the computer itself is your job.

605
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:08,580
Rym: But a lot of people seem to think that if the computer itself is not your job Then you don't need to know about the computer and that's completely false.

606
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:14,522
Scott: Yeah, it's not like a car where you don't have to know how in the mechanism of internal combustion But you can still drive.

607
00:43:14,622 --> 00:43:18,690
Rym: it might someday get to that point with AI and such but not in the next couple generations.

608
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:24,059
Scott: Nope, I at least were well beyond the point of DOS where you had to you know, use a command line.

609
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:24,401
Scott: now It's.

610
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:28,680
Scott: it's a lot easier now, you're better off, but you still have to learn a lot to be able to use a computer.

611
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:30,460
Rym: Yep, so you don't have to be like us.

612
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:38,260
Rym: You don't have to be a computer professional unless your job is to be a computer profession Which it might well be but you have to be able to use a computer.

613
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:42,740
Scott: Do you have to be able to use a computer without having to have like the system in yell at you?

614
00:43:43,984 --> 00:43:47,030
Rym: so How come now may I don't?

615
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,620
Rym: I mean there's might be a lot of reasons for it.

616
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,302
Rym: How come?

617
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:59,011
Rym: at least in my experience I have never met a middle school or high school Computer teacher who knew one good goddamn about computers.

618
00:43:59,573 --> 00:44:01,398
Scott: Well, here's part of the in my high school online.

619
00:44:03,082 --> 00:44:06,800
Scott: Well in my high school in my schools, they didn't actually have computer teachers, right?

620
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:22,061
Scott: It was that, you know, some teachers knew more about computers and others, you know And some of them were actually good at using them, you know, but for example in my high school There were a bunch of computer classes you could take But pretty much all of them were like in the business school like how to use and they were all how to use word how To use.

621
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:27,198
Scott: you know Excel how to use whatever taught by business teachers and they would mostly teach business.

622
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:32,760
Scott: or you know Like when I took a how to type it was mostly like how to format a letter and how to type on these old.

623
00:44:32,863 --> 00:44:39,342
Scott: I you know They that was the one class that used incredibly old computers as the how to type class because they had the old clackety XT Keyboards.

624
00:44:39,423 --> 00:44:39,986
Scott: it was good stuff.

625
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:53,167
Scott: But the only other computer class was A Computer science classes visual basic taught by a math teacher who got read a book on visual basic The math teacher not a computer teacher.

626
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,792
Scott: and the reason is first of all, you know schools, you know People talk about schools not having enough money.

627
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:03,695
Scott: I'm not gonna talk about that now But I think you know, I'll just say that I think schools have plenty of money.

628
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:04,780
Scott: They just spend it stupidly.

629
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,560
Rym: Well, I think it's much more complex than that because there are schools that have plenty of money and spend it stupidly.

630
00:45:09,821 --> 00:45:12,310
Rym: There are schools that spend their money smartly.

631
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,334
Rym: They just don't have enough money.

632
00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:19,150
Rym: Yeah, it's all kinds To defray and just dilute all the flames.

633
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:28,540
Rym: We might get you can't apply a Blanket solution to the school funding problem in the United States because every school every state every town is completely different.

634
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:32,880
Scott: But I just want to say that there's a lot of people who are like money is the solution to all school problems.

635
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,603
Rym: Well, you know what?

636
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:34,305
Rym: It's not school.

637
00:45:34,325 --> 00:45:38,863
Rym: There are a lot of people who say money is the problem too are the solution to all Problems.

638
00:45:39,064 --> 00:45:45,233
Rym: Yes, a lot of government agencies in the US like to just throw money at a problem And usually that just makes the problem bigger.

639
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:47,200
Rym: and now I have less money Yep.

640
00:45:47,521 --> 00:46:08,207
Scott: But anyway, they the thing is is that anyone in order to actually have a good computer education You're gonna need someone at the school at least one person who actually knows about freaking computers like actually knows like as Much as we do or almost as much as we do someone knowledgeable who really knows like how a CPU works at least basically You know and these kinds of things.

641
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:09,653
Scott: how else can they teach them if they don't know?

642
00:46:10,195 --> 00:46:10,356
Scott: right?

643
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:11,260
Scott: you your teacher?

644
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,599
Scott: Must know more than the student or else it doesn't work, right?

645
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:25,880
Scott: So the problem is is anyone who actually knows That amount of stuff can go and get a job and make a zillion dollars because there aren't enough of those people?

646
00:46:26,145 --> 00:46:28,246
Rym: I mean, I'll be honest I really want to be.

647
00:46:28,707 --> 00:46:32,466
Rym: my dream job for a long time was to just be a high school Computer.

648
00:46:32,486 --> 00:46:33,779
Scott: that was also my dream job.

649
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:42,585
Scott: Summers summers off, you know don't have to work the whole day work in the town in which you live very short commute Really good benefits.

650
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:45,053
Scott: you get to work with cool kids and tea.

651
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:46,880
Scott: I like teaching kids and telling them what's up.

652
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,339
Scott: I mean, you know, I like I do a podcast or I tell people how computers work.

653
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:58,280
Scott: How awesome would it be if I sat there for you know, seven hours a day or I guess not seven hours But many hours a day telling high school kids how to do a computer.

654
00:46:58,404 --> 00:46:58,630
Scott: So,

655
00:46:58,795 --> 00:47:14,915
Rym: you know I applied to a bunch of teaching jobs and you know I was willing to get my masters and be a teacher as long as I could teach computer classes and I was even willing to stay after school and run computer clubs and anything computer they wanted and Be the head IT guy for their school if they wanted because I can do that.

656
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:19,813
Rym: Yep, but Pretty much every non teaching job.

657
00:47:19,893 --> 00:47:26,780
Rym: I looked into paid Two to four times more than the best paying teaching job.

658
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:37,360
Scott: Yeah, even if I was like head computer guy for a school district it paid a pittance a Pitons compared to what I make at my sort of average coding job.

659
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:46,589
Rym: the other problem is it seems like it's pretty much impossible for someone who knows about computers and is you know a computer professional to Just become a computer teacher.

660
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,780
Rym: because schools don't want a computer teacher.

661
00:47:49,141 --> 00:47:54,620
Rym: They want a teacher and they want them to teach a bunch of things especially in like American public high schools.

662
00:47:55,062 --> 00:47:56,206
Rym: So they don't like.

663
00:47:56,247 --> 00:47:59,440
Rym: they couldn't just get someone like me to teach a computer class.

664
00:47:59,783 --> 00:48:01,160
Rym: They'd have to get me to get my masters.

665
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:12,841
Rym: They probably make me teach a math class or something stupid - they make you teach like physics And then you teach like one computer class a day And also I think the more even a bigger problem than that schools pretty much with rare exceptions I mean.

666
00:48:12,862 --> 00:48:16,640
Rym: actually my old high school offers a lot of really good computer classes.

667
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:23,907
Rym: But that's because they're shall we say a wash in the money that comes from being one of the wealthiest suburbs in the country Even in places of washing money.

668
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:24,570
Scott: They do a lot of.

669
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,420
Scott: they try to run good computer class and they fail.

670
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:33,865
Rym: So that's what does they teach the kids see really well and a lot of teaching it though It's a special case.

671
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:35,070
Rym: there aren't many schools like that.

672
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:35,793
Rym: Yeah, okay.

673
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,340
Rym: I could do a whole show on my high school.

674
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:39,229
Rym: Yeah, what I think it was a pretty good high school.

675
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:40,254
Rym: I think they did things right.

676
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:41,340
Scott: my high school is okay.

677
00:48:41,883 --> 00:48:44,440
Scott: Yeah, wasn't the best wasn't the worst just kind of good good.

678
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,180
Rym: But it seems like a lot of schools aren't willing to put computer literacy as high up.

679
00:48:50,322 --> 00:48:54,735
Rym: I mean they say like oh well you know math is important and science is important and all those things are important and they are.

680
00:48:54,755 --> 00:49:08,078
Rym: but basic computer literacy is just as important if not more so because no matter it doesn't matter if you're good at math and good at Science and good at all these other things in the next decade or two if you're not also competent at computers.

681
00:49:08,098 --> 00:49:08,680
Rym: You're worthless.

682
00:49:09,022 --> 00:49:14,940
Scott: Yeah, also, you know, maybe I just thought of this just now Maybe some of it has to do with the the no standardized.

683
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:17,897
Scott: You know the standardized testing because it's like all these schools seem to care about.

684
00:49:18,138 --> 00:49:19,820
Scott: is you know Their test scores and blabbity blabbity?

685
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:31,833
Rym: well part of that also has to do with the fact that You know the big problem again of how to distribute money to schools and every now and then people get the misguided idea that Why don't we reward schools who have better students by giving them more money?

686
00:49:31,913 --> 00:49:33,580
Rym: or why don't we reward schools that?

687
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:44,965
Rym: Get more kids to pass and then schools either lower their standards So more kids pass or teach to whatever test they're using to determine how good the school district is or in a lot of cases Cheat outright.

688
00:49:45,326 --> 00:49:46,570
Scott: Yeah teachers just say, huh?

689
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,316
Scott: We'll get more money if the kids do better.

690
00:49:48,336 --> 00:49:49,420
Scott: Well, let's make all their grades go up.

691
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,890
Scott: We'll do get more money if the kids do worse.

692
00:49:51,111 --> 00:49:52,299
Scott: We'll make all their grades go down.

693
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:57,820
Rym: It's like yeah, but let's not get off on the tangents of schools because I want to get specifically on technology.

694
00:49:58,021 --> 00:50:00,817
Rym: Yeah, let's suffice to say boil it down.

695
00:50:00,878 --> 00:50:01,280
Rym: core issue

696
00:50:02,841 --> 00:50:22,253
Scott: Core issue is that schools don't know how to teach technology They don't have an incentive to teach technology and as a result, we're gonna I think the u.s Especially at least I don't know how it's going in other countries I think we're gonna fall behind the rest of the world because we're gonna have a generation of people who don't know enough about Technology who won't be able to do anything unless they know about technology.

697
00:50:22,293 --> 00:50:25,939
Scott: and I there are some other places in the world maybe like South Korea and such.

698
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:28,690
Scott: We're gonna pull ahead of us and make a bunch of awesome things.

699
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:33,610
Scott: and we're not gonna make awesome things because their people their labor Force knows how to use computers and ours doesn't.

700
00:50:33,871 --> 00:50:44,360
Rym: so specifically why I mean I think they're on one hand one really important issue here is that like I said before, you know They always separate the technology from the rest of the classes.

701
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:57,994
Rym: so there's the computer class and then there's the English class and they don't use computers in the English class, but Beyond that they a lot of schools try to integrate like they say Oh, we're gonna integrate computers everywhere as it should be, you know computers are going to be you're gonna

702
00:50:58,094 --> 00:51:05,559
Scott: use technology in all the classrooms Everything's gonna be all teched up and I all sorts of things and they put technology in every classroom of some sort.

703
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:13,344
Rym: now Even if the school has the the rare competent computer teacher or the good computer teaching department in the high school That's great.

704
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:15,158
Rym: So the computer classes are good.

705
00:51:16,044 --> 00:51:26,530
Rym: but now kids are in an English class and That English teacher doesn't know jack all about computers and they use the technology Inefficiently and incorrectly and it go.

706
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,740
Rym: it's worse than just you know using it inefficiently.

707
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:40,491
Rym: but like I said earlier in the news part when a kid is in school and A teacher is trying to teach them something and the kid actually does know more than the teacher The kids not gonna listen that teacher ever again.

708
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:41,817
Rym: They've lost all respect for that person.

709
00:51:41,857 --> 00:51:46,000
Scott: as an educator I can't tell you how many times especially in high school, but also middle school, right?

710
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:54,669
Scott: Some teacher would have some sort of technology in the classroom that they were supposed to use to teach us with right or like a graphing Calculator or some sort of.

711
00:51:54,689 --> 00:51:57,060
Rym: you know overhead graphing graphing calculators were the worst.

712
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,387
Rym: They didn't know how those work

713
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:15,611
Scott: or or some sort of you know computer display or some sort of magical chalkboard Right, and it's like the teachers would just have sort of like this instruction like this sort of like manual Like here is how to use this technology to teach the students right and they would just do what the manual said.

714
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:27,331
Scott: and if it even worked at all and I'd be sitting there and I'd be like I know how this shit works and you're doing this in a stupid way and You're don't actually understand how this technology works and you don't.

715
00:52:27,693 --> 00:52:34,799
Scott: the teacher needs to have an Understanding of how the technology works not just following directions But actually needs to know how it works now.

716
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:40,078
Scott: It's not to be able to use it as an effective teaching tool Even if they really know how to teach really well.

717
00:52:40,721 --> 00:52:48,248
Scott: They if they have a tool that that has the potential to help teach and they don't know how to use the tool That don't know any point in using it.

718
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:48,650
Rym: now.

719
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:55,000
Rym: remember they don't have to be a computer scientist They don't have to be able to write the program They don't have to be able to set up the network.

720
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:56,967
Rym: They just have to be able to use the tool.

721
00:52:57,308 --> 00:53:06,967
Rym: and the fact that I think the majority of educators in the United States Cannot even use the tool is the biggest problem in education today Discounting money problems in poor districts.

722
00:53:07,368 --> 00:53:13,735
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, some teacher might have say You know like a magical, you know chalkboard.

723
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:14,740
Scott: that's all digital, right?

724
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,124
Scott: And there could be a lot of.

725
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:19,760
Scott: there's a lot of cool things you could do with the digital chalkboard to to teach better.

726
00:53:20,021 --> 00:53:20,806
Scott: Right many things.

727
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:23,340
Scott: you could get some videos up on there and pictures move them around.

728
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:38,536
Scott: I could think of a million things right now a way in which a digital chalkboard That's just like a giant LCD screen or something would improve educate could be used even by like a math teacher To make it, you know to teach the students better and have them understand math better.

729
00:53:38,556 --> 00:53:39,800
Scott: and this is they do with a regular.

730
00:53:39,981 --> 00:53:44,677
Rym: This is why money often doesn't solve the problem because look poor school can't afford even textbooks.

731
00:53:44,697 --> 00:53:45,218
Rym: So they're screwed.

732
00:53:45,259 --> 00:53:48,120
Rym: already Rich school can afford everything they want.

733
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:50,900
Rym: So they spend the money on you know, the big technology.

734
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,040
Rym: We're gonna get the smart classrooms and then none of the teachers know how to use it.

735
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,336
Scott: And when the school comes to get inspected they go look we have all this cool technology.

736
00:53:58,377 --> 00:53:59,260
Scott: Look how cool we are.

737
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,085
Scott: We're the best school.

738
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:02,400
Scott: We have technology and the teachers are using it to teach students.

739
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,667
Rym: I mean while I you know as a kid.

740
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:11,811
Rym: I sit there at the computer and I've already broken out and I'm on the internet or Chatting on prodigy or something and playing some games.

741
00:54:11,892 --> 00:54:19,298
Rym: I installed while the teacher is Laboriously trying to explain how to make something bold in Microsoft Word.

742
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,048
Scott: Yep I mean you think about it.

743
00:54:21,068 --> 00:54:22,860
Scott: you give the teacher the digital chalkboard, right?

744
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,320
Scott: There's a potential there to to really have an amazing teaching experience better than with the regular chalkboard.

745
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,228
Scott: But what's really gonna happen?

746
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:37,434
Scott: that teacher who doesn't know how to use it doesn't know how to use the tool properly is actually gonna do a worse job of teaching than if they had the plain old chalkboard.

747
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:44,280
Scott: because they're only gonna be able to Do things with that because they only know to do things with it that they would do with the normal chalkboard.

748
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:46,960
Scott: So they're not actually creating a better teaching experience.

749
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,391
Scott: They're just using the technology because that's what you're supposed to do.

750
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,460
Scott: You're supposed to use technology in the classroom.

751
00:54:51,761 --> 00:54:55,698
Scott: So that's why they're gonna do it worse because they don't know how to use the technology.

752
00:54:55,979 --> 00:55:05,960
Rym: sadly It's not just technology because I can think of a lot of instances when I was in middle school Especially where it wasn't just I'd be in a class and the teacher would be wrong

753
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:07,120
Scott: Outright

754
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:12,559
Rym: Obviously wrong and yet to point that out was often cause for disciplinary action.

755
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:18,720
Rym: Yep I mean I think the my fate one of my favorite moments ever in middle school is this teacher was teaching us how to like plot.

756
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:26,060
Rym: It was a social studies teacher nonetheless, but she's teaching us how to like plot data and analyze like a graph.

757
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:27,069
Scott: I should be math teacher.

758
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:28,200
Rym: Yeah, but she's doing it.

759
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,120
Rym: You know and I can see the point cuz I'm really a big advocate of cross curriculum.

760
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,714
Rym: Definitely because I that's you can't I?

761
00:55:35,036 --> 00:55:55,096
Rym: you know, we said, you know if you split the technology from the other things then it's kind of like how a lot of people especially older people have trouble with computers because even though they could solve the problem on their own if they apply just their rational intelligence Which they have to the problem people Compartmentalize things and they don't realize that they can use their life skills in areas.

762
00:55:55,137 --> 00:55:58,197
Rym: They might not have expected They can fork it in, you know a field of related knowledge.

763
00:55:58,418 --> 00:56:02,120
Rym: Yep I mean you might be 70 and you know jack all about computers.

764
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:13,324
Rym: But if you use the computer and it breaks and you read what's on the screen and you're smart You can figure out how to make it go, but a lot of people run into a computer problem and they say oh It's a computer.

765
00:56:13,505 --> 00:56:13,907
Rym: I don't know.

766
00:56:14,128 --> 00:56:16,180
Scott: It's in the computer don't even read what it says on the screen.

767
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,471
Scott: That's why you say what was the error message?

768
00:56:17,531 --> 00:56:17,894
Scott: I don't know.

769
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:28,469
Rym: Just with technology people Compartmentalize partly I think because the way education is in the US and as a result They don't have this ability to fuse knowledge together.

770
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:31,498
Rym: and you know, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

771
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:37,000
Rym: kind of deal yep, but This teacher is teaching this wrong like outright wrong.

772
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:44,751
Rym: It is just pathetically incorrect what she has said and I raised my hand to basically say, um, you're doing it wrong that's not how you do it.

773
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:46,986
Rym: and She says no, I'm doing it right.

774
00:56:47,107 --> 00:56:47,569
Rym: What do you know?

775
00:56:47,589 --> 00:56:50,280
Rym: Yeah, I'm the teacher and I said you're doing it wrong.

776
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,510
Rym: Do you want me to go get the math teacher and prove it?

777
00:56:53,334 --> 00:56:54,299
Rym: and then she freaked out?

778
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:58,924
Rym: And the freaking out culminated in where if you're so smart Why don't you teach the class?

779
00:56:59,306 --> 00:57:05,371
Rym: and she like stood up there and she's like she folded her arms And she gives me this look of how do you like it now?

780
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:15,410
Rym: now that spotlights on you and I get up I walk to the front of the room and I take the chalk and I take the thing and I taught the class Yep, and then I was recommended for detention.

781
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:16,232
Rym: Yep.

782
00:57:16,553 --> 00:57:16,894
Rym: Yep.

783
00:57:17,376 --> 00:57:18,459
Scott: See I read a story online.

784
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,527
Scott: Don't know how true it is because the story online.

785
00:57:20,888 --> 00:57:24,220
Scott: but the story was that there was some some high school class.

786
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,320
Scott: I think it was a science class and On the first day of this class the kids went in and the teacher taught him all about this animal.

787
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:35,424
Scott: I forget the name of the animal, but the teacher of Jabberwocky Maybe not the Jabberwocky But some other animal right.

788
00:57:35,805 --> 00:57:40,236
Scott: and the teacher taught everyone about this animal and told them there's gonna be a quiz the next day All right.

789
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:47,882
Scott: So the kids are all taking notes about this animal that teachers teaching them about and you know in the next day they come in And they get a quiz Right.

790
00:57:48,124 --> 00:57:48,406
Scott: All right.

791
00:57:48,467 --> 00:57:51,446
Scott: I think he gave him the quiz at the end of the class or something I don't remember regardless.

792
00:57:51,486 --> 00:57:52,452
Scott: He taught him about an animal.

793
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:54,000
Scott: He gave him a quiz on the animals.

794
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,280
Scott: It's the first thing they do in this guy's class, right?

795
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:07,440
Scott: he gives him back the quiz and everyone got all F's right and those F's fucking counted and Basically everything the teacher told him was a lie on purpose told him about a fake animal made up a bunch of bullshit.

796
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,975
Scott: That was totally believable and he said it was all wrong.

797
00:58:10,015 --> 00:58:10,880
Scott: I totally lied to you.

798
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:17,340
Scott: so you got all the questions wrong because you answered what I told you and Those students went on first of all.

799
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:22,342
Scott: They loved that class and that teacher was awesome and every teacher needs to be like that and any teacher less than that shouldn't Be a teacher.

800
00:58:22,443 --> 00:58:25,115
Scott: but the problem is there aren't enough people like that because they weren't.

801
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:26,120
Scott: there's not enough people taught.

802
00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:34,060
Rym: There aren't even enough people who know how to make a US business have that guy teach the entire country with over the internet.

803
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:34,924
Scott: That's what they should do.

804
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,351
Rym: I've had a couple teachers like that.

805
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:37,215
Rym: So yeah, definitely.

806
00:58:37,316 --> 00:58:37,577
Rym: Yeah.

807
00:58:37,657 --> 00:58:38,200
Scott: Yeah, there were a few.

808
00:58:38,301 --> 00:58:40,277
Scott: they're always a few in every school, but there's never enough.

809
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:53,439
Scott: and The the students those students would go into the other classes and always be questioning the teachers Just like he taught them to and they'd often be getting that telling other teachers They were wrong and the other teachers didn't like that guy so much.

810
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:58,802
Scott: But that's he was a good teacher and the rest of them were shitty teachers and the kids that were in his class turned out Awesome.

811
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:00,833
Rym: Well, I remember the one time my little brother was.

812
00:59:00,853 --> 00:59:02,240
Scott: it was a true story because it was a story.

813
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,146
Rym: This is a true story.

814
00:59:03,186 --> 00:59:05,320
Rym: I think I told on the show before but it bears repeating.

815
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:05,904
Rym: I'll be brief.

816
00:59:05,944 --> 00:59:10,969
Rym: my little brothers in like elementary school and The textbook has a typo.

817
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:16,638
Rym: it switched am and p.m When talking about time like noon and midnight, so it was wrong.

818
00:59:16,658 --> 00:59:26,146
Rym: in the textbook The teacher teaches this my brother little brother raises hand little elementary schools kid and says oh you're wrong, you know 12 p.m.

819
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,273
Rym: 12 a.m.

820
00:59:27,374 --> 00:59:32,053
Rym: Is like this and The teacher basically says you don't know anything.

821
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:32,957
Rym: You're just some kid.

822
00:59:32,977 --> 00:59:38,118
Rym: I'm the teacher I'm right and then proceeds to teach but the textbook said which was wrong.

823
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,749
Rym: now This isn't like some esoteric thing 12 a.m.

824
00:59:41,749 --> 00:59:43,013
Rym: 12 p.m.

825
00:59:43,274 --> 00:59:44,017
Rym: Noon midnight.

826
00:59:44,277 --> 00:59:45,020
Rym: Good God.

827
00:59:45,622 --> 00:59:49,400
Rym: So she then, you know, my brother says well you're wrong and he won't let it drop.

828
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:54,977
Rym: So she basically ridicules him in front of the class like 10 minutes about how how dare he?

829
00:59:54,997 --> 00:59:55,900
Rym: you know, look at him.

830
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,463
Rym: He's dumb.

831
00:59:56,503 --> 00:59:59,400
Rym: He doesn't know anything and yet he's trying to you know, show me up.

832
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:05,260
Rym: He's trying to ruin your education and get in the way of you all being taught because he thinks he knows better than me the teacher.

833
01:00:06,361 --> 01:00:13,670
Rym: So he comes home in tears, you know little kid obviously and tells my mom No, no, so that's it you could.

834
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:20,880
Scott: you can tell if you have a good mom cuz a Bad mom goes and shut up and a good mom goes and smacks teachers around.

835
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,160
Rym: You know what?

836
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:32,892
Rym: it's like in Donnie Darko when his parents get called into the school and they you know that that counselor is telling his parents what he Did and instead of being angry they're just laughing like That's so great.

837
01:00:33,216 --> 01:00:34,576
Rym: Yeah I can't believe he did that.

838
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:38,613
Rym: He's That's how it should but the righteous fury.

839
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:40,100
Rym: now it gets better.

840
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:47,343
Rym: My mom goes into the school All right, and you know, she goes to talk to this teacher and she tries to explain and the teacher basically says yeah Well, your kid was wrong.

841
01:00:47,363 --> 01:00:48,607
Rym: So I corrected him and he made a fit.

842
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:53,583
Rym: So my mom says, you know that 12 p.m.

843
01:00:53,623 --> 01:00:54,706
Rym: Is noon and 12 a.m.

844
01:00:54,726 --> 01:00:55,709
Rym: Is midnight, right?

845
01:00:56,412 --> 01:00:59,911
Rym: So she pulls out the textbook and shows to my mom says see Mm-hmm.

846
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:05,340
Scott: So obviously this teacher was taught by someone that the teacher in the textbook is always right.

847
01:01:05,802 --> 01:01:07,752
Scott: Well, she had ten and not to question authority.

848
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:08,636
Scott: Yeah ten your problem.

849
01:01:08,656 --> 01:01:09,340
Rym: Yeah, she had tenure.

850
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:10,869
Scott: I don't think that tenure should exist.

851
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:12,720

Scott: so yeah, but I'm you know threatened to sue.

857
01:01:40,122 --> 01:01:54,220
Scott: There's just a general problem of how can we I think the fundamental problem here, you know Cuz we talked about the technology aspect I guess as much as we could but the fundamental problem seems to be how can people educate our children when they themselves?

858
01:01:54,220 --> 01:02:02,820
Scott: Or at least not all of them, but enough of them are not educated enough themselves Like they don't even know everything that they're teaching?
