00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,467
Rym: It's Thursday January 4th.

2
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,200
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,520
Rym: We tell a geek fable of New Year's parties past and present.

4
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:21,718
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:34,639
Rym: So today I encountered what might be called an awkward social situation and being tired from the whole week as I am Instead of dealing with it pithily I dealt with it in a rather lame manner.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,211
Rym: How awkward could it be when you're just walking around the city?

7
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:45,655
Rym: no no no no there was some trickery involved and In addition to that I mean doing this show.

8
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:49,416
Rym: and just from the stuff We did at RIT a lot of people tend to know us who.

9
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:50,180
Rym: we don't know them.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,808
Rym: So we'll be out somewhere like at a con.

11
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:58,998
Rym: so we'll come up and say hey Rym and Scott Whoa it's great to see you or something like that and we'll be like look at each other with the who.

12
00:00:59,018 --> 00:00:59,620
Rym: the hell is this?

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,122
Rym: RIT?

14
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:02,166
Rym: does he listen to the show?

15
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,492
Rym: did we meet him at a con?

16
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:03,813
Rym: did we?

17
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:05,459
Rym: did we play board games with them?

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,206
Rym: Who is this person?

19
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:06,590
Rym: Oh god?

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,580
Rym: Yeah, is it my brother's?

21
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:11,448
Rym: Is it a friend of a friend?

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,640
Rym: yep, is it just some stranger trying to con us?

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,854
Rym: We don't know and there's no way for us to know at this point We know there are too many people seek us out.

24
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:21,004
Rym: so as a result And especially enough.

25
00:01:21,044 --> 00:01:21,787
Rym: I'm wide awake.

26
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:32,655
Rym: I tend to deal with it better and usually I just kind of manage, but if I'm tired Kind of secondary to the whole conversation I tend to go on autopilot in Social situations that I'm not particularly caring about or enamored with.

27
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:36,410
Rym: it really just be like hey Not saying who you are or anything.

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:47,339
Rym: well you heard yesterday when we were tired And I kept going things of the day, and I'm all loud and boisterous even though I'm just in tired to Scott I can go on autopilot socially for a long time before I finally pass out.

29
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:57,850
Rym: So I'm over lunch at work going to the supermarket to pick up some lip balm because my lips are a little bit chapped Bomb bomb bomb and I buy something on my way out.

30
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:00,359
Rym: this girl this somewhat attractive girl who?

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,731
Rym: Kinda in retrospect looks like a few people.

32
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:09,120
Rym: I've knew like back in high school Says like hey hey, and I'm about to walk out and just hey again.

33
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,697
Rym: So I turn around and those girls looking right at me, and she's like she says something like hey.

34
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:15,540
Rym: How are you doing?

35
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,608
Rym: And it's definitely the hey how you doing of?

36
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:19,491
Rym: I know you.

37
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:20,695
Rym: so I stand there.

38
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,300
Rym: for maybe she just thought you were someone else.

39
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:28,800
Rym: No, no, no, that's where it gets interesting, so I stand there, and I go oh hey, and she says what brings you here?

40
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:40,747
Rym: I'm holding my little chapstick my little mango butter organic chapstick not for any organic reasons but just cuz I like the taste of it and I'm like at this point my brain is going.

41
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:47,049
Rym: I know this person obviously or they know me must react in socially responsible Manner alpha B.

42
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,599
Rym: I just came to buy a chapstick.

43
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:55,340
Rym: So I say hey fancy seeing you here of course which I say a lot.

44
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:58,330
Rym: What if it was someone that actually just thought you were someone else?

45
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,153
Rym: and you said that?

46
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:02,504
Rym: well the thing is I had turned around I was close enough to where.

47
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:05,715
Rym: there is no way this person could have mistaken me for someone else.

48
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:12,193
Rym: now after I say this She stands there Unmoving looking at me with and her eyes changed.

49
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:16,300
Rym: They give me the look of oh shit I don't know how to deal with this situation.

50
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,269
Rym: This is not the social interaction.

51
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:19,931
Rym: I expected.

52
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:24,529
Rym: so now I'm standing there going Damn it now.

53
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:26,420
Scott: What and we're both standing there.

54
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,580
Rym: So who are you know before I can react remember?

55
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,386
Rym: I'm tired.

56
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:41,712
Rym: you know when I'm tired And I really don't expect like I'm in a place where I don't expect to run into anyone like I'm at a diner alone Somewhere in the Bronx the odds of me running into someone.

57
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:46,110
Rym: I know there are practically zero And especially the way she engaged me with this.

58
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:48,420
Rym: hey, how you doing was it?

59
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,502
Rym: Threw me off.

60
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:53,099
Rym: so then she snaps out of it, and she says well come on over.

61
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,888
Rym: So I'm like ah and I walk over there.

62
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:58,396
Rym: my mind's going all right all right serial killer.

63
00:03:58,477 --> 00:03:59,139
Rym: What's going on?

64
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,500
Rym: stalker?

65
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:01,828
Rym: Maybe she's with someone that you know.

66
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:02,912
Rym: then you'll be like.

67
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:04,257
Rym: yeah, I'm totally.

68
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,917
Rym: I have no idea What's going on?

69
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:09,253
Rym: And I'm not awake enough to come up with some funny way to get out of this.

70
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,580
Rym: and then she raised me over to a Table and on this table is a bunch of charity bullshit.

71
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:18,959
Rym: And she starts trying to give me the rigmarole of buy this t-shirt to save homeless kids.

72
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:28,246
Rym: And then I realized that she was using the overly friendly demeanor to trick people into walking over in order to get them to Our guilt them into buying this charity.

73
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:28,687
Rym: BS.

74
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:37,019
Rym: Oh and the fact that I reacted in a normal social manner and The fact that I reacted in a way she didn't expect totally threw her off.

75
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:43,111
Rym: so then after she goes into her standard sales pitch I At this point don't care anymore, and I'm tired.

76
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,516
Rym: so instead of making up something funny.

77
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:47,669
Rym: You're being like sorry I gotta go kill a cat or something stupid.

78
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:49,337
Rym: I just kind of go.

79
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,340
Rym: Sorry I don't have any cash, which is the total cop-out answer, and she says don't worry about that.

80
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,168
Rym: We take Visa and MasterCard.

81
00:04:58,188 --> 00:05:00,980
Rym: Yeah, and I just look at her for a second.

82
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,748
Rym: I shrug, and I just walk away.

83
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:05,734
Rym: Yeah, and I look back.

84
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:06,637
Rym: you didn't give her the finger.

85
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:07,720
Rym: I just walked away.

86
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:09,924
Rym: I gave.

87
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:11,612
Rym: I gave her the without saying.

88
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:11,954
Rym: so much.

89
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,142
Rym: I basically gave her the Gesture.

90
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:17,235
Rym: that means I know you caught me in my lie.

91
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:18,340
Rym: You caught me in my bluff.

92
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:21,840
Rym: I'm well aware of that, and I don't care because I'm not going to interact with you anyway.

93
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:35,019
Rym: So I walk out and as I look into the window kind of as I'm walking out She's still looking at me with his look at what the fuck was up with that guy And I just went back to my car and drove back to my office drank a couple of Red Bulls and went on with my day

94
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,782
Rym: Mm-hmm.

95
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:41,739
Rym: and now I spent five minutes and some 30 seconds telling everyone in the world about this.

96
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,712
Rym: So what do we got in the news Robin?

97
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:51,600
Rym: I'm Chewing some bubblegum actually a blow pop and it's all crunchy, so I'm holding the microphone away from my face.

98
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,332
Rym: You don't hear this now?

99
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:54,480
Rym: see I wasn't looking at Scott.

100
00:05:54,621 --> 00:06:06,880
Rym: I was talking so I kept pausing waiting for Scott to come in and then finally I turn and look at him like you're gonna say something and he just gives me The look of I'm chewing on something and we sat here for several seconds in silence.

101
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:08,663
Rym: That's how these things go.

102
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:12,690
Rym: yeah, I'm gonna cut all that silence out, but suffice to say it was there.

103
00:06:13,903 --> 00:06:29,418
Rym: So anyway in the news being Thursday I can talk about whatever I want and it seems like Brazil the country Brazil is trying to Put forth a lot more clout and influence over the internet than it has any warrant to do so to do.

104
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:40,960
Rym: See a while ago there was some sort of illegal pornography issue on or cut which is the Popular in Brazil social networking software that was nominally put out by Google.

105
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:42,745
Rym: There are also drug dealers.

106
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:43,467
Rym: using or cut.

107
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:47,963
Rym: or cut is basically a thing kind of like my not really myspace But

108
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:49,258
Rym: like a friendster

109
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:59,418
Rym: Friendster Facebook that Google that a guy at Google made and there was a hubbub about it, and then it died Except in Brazil where it was adapted heavily yeah

110
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:01,190
Rym: well in fact It's more that it was kind of.

111
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,579
Rym: it was half endorsed by Google And it was really kind of cool.

112
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:10,200
Rym: And then someone invited someone from the nation of Brazil and within a week Gorka was done.

113
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,483
Rym: It was just over.

114
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:15,755
Rym: there were more Brazilian people speaking other languages than they were.

115
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,380
Rym: I was almost I almost said Brazilian.

116
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:21,794
Rym: Then there were you know anyone else or any other nationality or any other language?

117
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:27,690
Rym: so uh now it's just a den of child pornography and drug dealers and just general mayhem.

118
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,744
Rym: and And Brazil said hey Google shut this shit down and give us the names of the people posting.

119
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:39,430
Rym: and Google said yeah, Brazil Sue us or cuts had problems lately.

120
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,041
Rym: I think I heard it was down for a while and it came back.

121
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,346
Rym: it had problems when it was new.

122
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:44,250
Rym: it never really worked.

123
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,896
Rym: I know it's having big problems lately.

124
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:48,727
Rym: I think it might be finally dead dead instead of just dead.

125
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,450
Rym: That's fine.

126
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:50,293
Rym: So it is.

127
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:51,719
Rym: that would be a good thing if it died.

128
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:59,363
Rym: died so more recently the ex-wife of Ronaldo who is very famous in the game of football or for you Americans soccer.

129
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,790
Rym: There was a video of his ex-wife having sex.

130
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,295
Rym: This video was posted on YouTube.

131
00:08:04,797 --> 00:08:06,783
Scott: doesn't YouTube not allow sexy videos?

132
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:13,849
Rym: YouTube the thing is even if it gets taken down I mean anytime a video is popular for every one that gets taken down like 10 more get posted.

133
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:26,124
Rym: and honestly, I think that part of YouTube strategy is that they purposefully allow such things to happen so that they can say that they Put forth the good-faith effort of removing the offending copyright, whatever.

134
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:30,425
Rym: yet at the same time They know that the users are gonna keep posting them sometimes.

135
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:31,470
Rym: They'll change the spelling.

136
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:39,006
Rym: Sometimes they'll post it in like 10 parts So it's not easy to find and they'll just keep posting it and the stuff is always there and nothing.

137
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:40,769
Rym: YouTube does keep the stuff From being there.

138
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,870
Scott: Well, the reason people post it in 10 parts is because YouTube only allows like 10 minutes of video every in one shot.

139
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,050
Scott: So you have to break up your TV shows in the two or three parts.

140
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,597
Rym: No, but I've seen things broken up into more parts than that.

141
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,750
Rym: I have yeah, yeah, especially things that are very likely to be taken down Mmm, but things that are long.

142
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:05,530
Rym: I definitely think there is some implicit cooperation between Google or God between YouTube and all these people posting illegal stuff.

143
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,919
Scott: Well, Google does own YouTube now.

144
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:08,710
Rym: Yeah, so that's why I got confused.

145
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:10,129
Rym: But this is specifically YouTube.

146
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,610
Rym: Google's not mentioned anywhere in here until at the end of our or cut.

147
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:16,625
Rym: Funny how it's always Google who gets involved in this stuff with Brazil.

148
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:27,441
Rym: But anyway Brazil and Ronaldo and his ex-wife have sued and ordered whatever and it came down to Brazil ordering YouTube to shut down Until they resolved the issue.

149
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:30,542
Scott: Ah Now YouTube in Brazil physically.

150
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:33,595
Scott: no then tough shit Google slash.

151
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:37,150
Rym: YouTube's response was basically a giant middle finger.

152
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:41,446
Rym: That's what I would expect and I don't know where Brazil gets off.

153
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:50,229
Rym: I mean If we tried to shut down some Brazilian website You can bet that the Brazilians would be pissed at us and the government would make a sting about how.

154
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:56,692
Rym: yeah We're defying those evil Americans trying to mess with our internet and yet they're trying to get us to Right.

155
00:09:56,893 --> 00:10:03,733
Rym: Imagine if the Ford Motor Company right did something to upset the country of Paraguay.

156
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:04,958
Scott: Paraguay, right?

157
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:17,519
Rym: Well Paraguay might be upset and Paraguay can say we are no longer Allowing the import of Ford Motor vehicles into our country until you do X Y & Z and that's perfectly fine.

158
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:22,950
Rym: They can do that and No one would have a problem with that except the people in Paraguay who wanted Ford's.

159
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,822
Rym: They couldn't tell Ford Motor Company.

160
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:28,874
Rym: You have to shut down Like laughs.

161
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:31,444
Rym: they very much can and Ford would say we'll get right on that.

162
00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:32,870
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

163
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:34,300
Rym: So why is it?

164
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,330
Rym: because when we're doing Internet's Like, you know countries all of a sudden think they can do this sort of silliness.

165
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:43,110
Rym: What do they not understand?

166
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,500
Rym: Well, the funniness here is that one quote from this article.

167
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:51,038
Rym: the court honored the request on Wednesday But the Brazilian court.

168
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:58,262
Rym: but legal experts say the ruling by the Brazilian court Could be difficult to enforce in the United States where YouTube is based.

169
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:05,143
Rym: if Brazil wants to keep YouTube out of Brazil They can tell all the you can make all the ISPs in Brazil block it.

170
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:15,524
Rym: now even worse the people involved here are suing YouTube for $116,000 per day and damages for each day that the video remains up.

171
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:19,454
Rym: and the video has been up for a while and I don't think anything will come of that.

172
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:21,139
Rym: but one what damages?

173
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,110
Rym: you can't prove damages in a US court for having a video like That on YouTube.

174
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:33,430
Rym: I mean I guess you could if you were a professional porn star and now your Your marketability has been degraded from having it given away for free or something.

175
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:38,546
Rym: But especially in this case where neither of these people are terrible celebrities.

176
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:42,216
Rym: I mean, it's not her having sex with Ronaldo it's someone else.

177
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:44,563
Rym: I mean that he is famous in other parts of the world.

178
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:44,924
Rym: Just not here.

179
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:47,659
Rym: here You know what?

180
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:53,021
Rym: She's not $16,000 famous no let alone per day not even close.

181
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:54,444
Rym: It's not here.

182
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:56,268
Rym: See the thing is she's hot.

183
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:56,929
Rym: I guess I.

184
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:12,321
Rym: Part of the reason I generally don't like the idea of a world government Is that I don't want to lose the ability that we have now to do things that should not be illegal in a country But are in countries where they're not illegal.

185
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:19,370
Rym: a lot of the good things on the internet Only exist because they exist in countries that don't have the shit laws that exist in some other places in the world.

186
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:22,027
Rym: Yeah, that is one problem with the world government.

187
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:25,123
Rym: is you know So one part of the world to be pissed off about something?

188
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,590
Rym: and now you can either.

189
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:31,270
Rym: You know, it'd be difficult to outlaw something in one part of the world, but not the other part of the world.

190
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:41,384
Rym: Yeah, I mean the way and you'll have one guy who's pissed off and like, you know the middle of nowhere in Mongolia making a law that affects everyone else in the world just because one guy's pissed.

191
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:43,954
Rym: and don't think this is just like a one-way Street with the US.

192
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:48,494
Rym: there is stuff that has to be hosted outside the US and there is stuff that has to be hosted in The US.

193
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:49,781
Rym: that is right.

194
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,110
Rym: It goes both ways.

195
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:57,369
Rym: So as long as different parts of the world people like different things and people will be able to get whatever they want.

196
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:01,410
Rym: if We make everything homogeneous then there'll be this set of stuff.

197
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,350
Rym: You can get the set of stuff you can't and that'll be the end of it, right?

198
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,715
Rym: So anyway, you got some news for me.

199
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:06,278
Rym: Yeah.

200
00:13:06,298 --> 00:13:07,563
Rym: Well, you know the Creative Commons.

201
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:09,150
Rym: Creative Commons is it?

202
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,844
Rym: You know, it might seem like all they do is give out Creative Commons licenses.

203
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:14,310
Rym: Well, they do more than that.

204
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,949
Rym: they're actually, you know, the Creative Commons Foundation or whatever they call themselves.

205
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:26,209
Rym: and Well, they've just released a new tool the termination of transfer beta tool its beta.

206
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:40,190
Rym: basically, there is a copyright law that says if you sign away your copyright to someone else that It is possible after a certain amount of time for you to terminate the transfer and take your rights back.

207
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:43,199
Rym: For example, they give some hypothetical examples.

208
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,142
Rym: I'll just read one of them.

209
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:47,372
Rym: You're an author who wrote a book in 65.

210
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:53,496
Rym: You wrote it on your own time and dime not as a part of your employment or at anyone else's suggestion Commissioning or order.

211
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,250
Rym: in 1980 you got a publication deal.

212
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:04,388
Rym: So you signed exclusive publishing agreement with big book corporation Which gave them the right to publish and distribute your book for the term of copyright, which is your life plus 70 years.

213
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:13,329
Rym: They published it in the same year in 1980 and now it's the year 2007. the book sold well But your royalty check is pretty small.

214
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:17,950
Rym: You want a better deal and want to see if you might be able to terminate the publishing deal?

215
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,401
Rym: Well, there is a law that just allows you to do that.

216
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,530
Rym: You can just terminate and get your rights back.

217
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:34,030
Rym: let's say you were a musician and you signed away your music to a record company and Then that was a long time ago and like the 50s and 60s and now you want your music back.

218
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:35,829
Rym: You can get it back now.

219
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,930
Rym: Obviously, it's not trivial or terribly easy because there are a lot of people who aren't able to get their music back.

220
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,129
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

221
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:52,447
Rym: apparently according to the Creative Commons This law exists and you can just get your music back or get your rights back after a certain amount of time and under certain conditions.

222
00:14:53,056 --> 00:15:03,110
Rym: however, the bureaucracy and stuff necessary to actually do it is Incredibly expensive and time-consuming and difficult and you need lawyers and money.

223
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:11,150
Rym: So while the law is basically clear that you can just get it back The actual process of doing it is next to impossible.

224
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:29,222
Rym: hence this new tool which allows you to just get your shit back if you're allowed to have your shit back according to the law and It's currently a beta tool and it's not a hundred percent yet But as soon as it's done You'll be able to get your rights back if you are legally allowed to do so.

225
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:34,177
Rym: This is going to be the awesome I am all about this.

226
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:41,661
Rym: I mean think about how many people artists out there You know made awesome stuff while they were working for some company.

227
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:48,698
Rym: or you know, think about how many I don't know like musicians Signed their music away.

228
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,089
Rym: It is like record companies a bajillion years ago.

229
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:54,070
Rym: Now imagine if they can take it back and you know.

230
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:04,670
Rym: Give the finger to these giant companies that just hold the rights to a million things You'll have like these big TV stations forced to go into their vaults and grab old videos and films out of there.

231
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:06,577
Rym: You'll have like.

232
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:07,582
Rym: it'll be crazy.

233
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:08,950
Rym: There's definitely.

234
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:17,909
Rym: This will definitely help because despite the fact that copyright lasts so long There'll be a lot of people who are just get their stuff and dish it out.

235
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:22,630
Rym: You know because it isn't being held by some greedy ass who's gonna hide it away forever.

236
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:29,966
Rym: So if you have any copyrights that you know, you've made some artwork like 35 40 years ago and You don't own it.

237
00:16:30,391 --> 00:16:37,450
Rym: How many of our listeners are over the age of 35 or 40 and how many of the people who are over the age of 35?

238
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,255
Rym: Made something when they were two years old.

239
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:42,465
Rym: That's how that they signed away to someone else.

240
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,760
Rym: Ah Yeah, the only thing I've signed away is stuff I've done for jobs.

241
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:48,603
Rym: Yeah.

242
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:51,070
Rym: Yeah, they got a few hypothetical situations.

243
00:16:51,110 --> 00:17:01,850
Rym: I'm not sure exactly what the law is about what you can get back and what you can't under what conditions but You can definitely get stuff back after a long enough period of time.

244
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:09,469
Rym: You know even if your contract specified a long without knowing those conditions, which I imagine our owner is I don't know how big a deal this will actually be.

245
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,138
Rym: Well, I think that's what the tool is for.

246
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,729
Rym: with a tool you enter in like You know what you did and then they'll tell you if and when you can get it back and how and they'll do it.

247
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,849
Rym: Why don't we make some stuff up and use the tool and see what we can come up with?

248
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,589
Rym: Because we'd have to also prove that we were the people who you know signed away the rights.

249
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:30,595
Rym: No, we just use the tool and try and then they'll say hey I'm pretty sure.

250
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:35,079
Rym: if we just if I read more of the words on this page It would just say what the provisions are.

251
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,264
Rym: Why don't you get on there?

252
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:36,726
Rym: We'll wait.

253
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:37,590
Scott: cuz I'm lazy.

254
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:45,149
Rym: things of the day.

255
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,618
Rym: So tonight my thing of the day.

256
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:53,038
Rym: actually Scott found this just before the New Year's party and we all know I found it like a week or two ago.

257
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:54,967
Scott: I just didn't actually show it to anybody.

258
00:17:55,148 --> 00:18:02,910
Rym: great Well, eventually he showed it to a bunch of people at the New Year's party and I finally just watched it And I got to say this is pretty hilarious.

259
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:08,028
Scott: Yeah, it's been a while since I've discovered a new stand-up comic who was funny.

260
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:10,918
Rym: Yeah I listen to pretty much the same stand-up comics.

261
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,323
Rym: I listened to five years ago.

262
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:13,970
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty sad.

263
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,547
Scott: I mean, there's definitely new people out there in the stand-up comedy realm and it is a entertainment medium.

264
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:20,510
Scott: I enjoy greatly.

265
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:25,419
Rym: Well, we have now discovered Russell Peters who very much does the.

266
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:25,760
Rym: you know.

267
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:28,087
Rym: what man do this black man?

268
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:32,644
Rym: do that comedy except He's Indian and his twist is white boy.

269
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:33,447
Rym: Do this black boy?

270
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,213
Rym: do this Indian boy.

271
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:35,895
Rym: do this.

272
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:37,138
Rym: He also does.

273
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:37,379
Rym: a lot

274
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,181
Scott: of Chinese

275
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:38,803
Rym: people do this,

276
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:39,545
Scott: but

277
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:41,290
Rym: it's that style of humor.

278
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:43,176
Rym: But give him a chance.

279
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:43,918
Rym: It's pretty funny.

280
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:49,575
Rym: And if nothing else I suggest you watch the final bit We've linked to here part five.

281
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,223
Scott: Yeah, part five is definitely the funniest part.

282
00:18:52,243 --> 00:19:03,850
Rym: That's his grand finale joke, if you will Yeah, suffice to say it involves probably our new catchphrase Somebody's gonna get hurt real bad somebody.

283
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:06,394
Scott: Think you might know him.

284
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,341
Rym: You might know him very well.

285
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:10,989
Rym: Yeah, I don't want to ruin it.

286
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:15,930
Rym: And I'll say now that knowing the punchline to the joke does not ruin the joke at all.

287
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:24,041
Rym: In fact, if anything it heightens the joke because he starts telling the joke and if you know the punchline You know exactly where he's going with it and you'll be laughing all the same.

288
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:24,563
Rym: Yep.

289
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:25,306
Rym: It's good.

290
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:26,230
Rym: Definitely good stuff.

291
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:28,280
Rym: And it's definitely you know that.

292
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:32,935
Rym: oh, it's so true Back in high school.

293
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:41,549
Rym: I had several Indian friends because there's a lot of Indian people where my high school was and Suffice to say their parents were all very much like the head.

294
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:45,121
Rym: I definitely also have to say this guy the what you can tell.

295

Rym: he's a talented comedian because like, you know his He doesn't just sit there and tell the jokes He like his facial expressions and his like body language is definitely like dead on.

296
00:19:56,585 --> 00:19:58,370

297
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,009
Rym: It's kind of a. hearing them is funny, but seeing them is twice as funny.

298
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,237
Rym: Yeah, cuz like like it does.

299
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:07,268

300
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,311
Rym: It's all good.

301
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:10,638
Rym: He does the face of an angry Indian dad.

302
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:14,308
Rym: It's that's exactly what Donald's dad looked like.

303
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:17,534
Rym: every time It's the raised.

304
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:27,567
Rym: just the way they stand there and they back up a bit like they're rearing back and they're just waiting and they're Gonna say something and then they're gonna hit you somebody gonna get alright.

305
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,547
Rym: So it's been a while since I had Legos for my thing of the day.

306
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:43,860
Rym: it has And so I found this is perhaps one of the greatest Lego things I've ever seen, you know Lego this Everyone knows that Lego is but Lego mind store.

307
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,083
Rym: Well, you mean Lego bricks.

308
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:47,229
Rym: Yeah, you can't call them Legos, right?

309
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:59,251
Rym: yeah, Lego mind storms is a set of Legos that involves programmable motors and You know, it's sort of a branch off of like the technic Legos which are like the mechanical gears and such You know.

310
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:10,068
Rym: and it adds in electrical power and computer programming and a bunch of sensors like, you know Infrared sensors to those gears, you know, like Legos with yeah, you know robots in him.

311
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:12,009
Rym: Yeah Yeah, you can make Lego robots.

312
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:12,873
Rym: They they used to.

313
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:16,386
Rym: I started off with this great r2d2 set that you know make an r2d2.

314
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:17,530
Rym: it was cool stuff.

315
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:20,409
Rym: So some guy took this and he said, huh?

316
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,114
Rym: Let's see what I can make.

317
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:27,778
Rym: and people have made a lot of interesting things Lego mind storms over the years and many different Languages and all sorts of goodies.

318
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:31,514
Rym: this guy made Get this ready.

319
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:31,855
Rym: Get ready.

320
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:32,297
Rym: Ready?

321
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:32,839
Rym: I'm ready.

322
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,670
Rym: He made a Lego factory.

323
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:37,515
Rym: Now out of Legos.

324
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:43,690
Rym: when Scott says Lego factory, I don't think you quite understand the scale of what this man is created.

325
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:51,184
Rym: basically, he loads up one end of the thing with Legos and these trays and these robots made of Lego.

326
00:21:51,665 --> 00:22:00,127
Rym: grab these Legos and move them around and Eventually put them together to create a Lego car.

327
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:05,010
Rym: now He even gets to pick the front end back end different colors.

328
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:10,890
Rym: Yeah, the way the machine works is there's a bunch of levers and each lever is for a different color.

329
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:16,691
Rym: So the first button you push is the front bit of the car and the second button you push is the second piece of the Car.

330
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:22,872
Rym: there's four bits of the car that you can change which color you want and all the different color pieces are loaded into The machine.

331
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,383
Rym: so you push color one you wait for it to the light to turn on.

332
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:31,422
Rym: you push color to color three color four And then it puts together the car that you ordered.

333
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:33,270
Rym: It is quite sweet.

334
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,550
Rym: It takes a while to watch the video like a good six minutes.

335
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:40,369
Rym: It's not the most efficient machine and it can only make one car at a time.

336
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,548
Rym: But hot damn this thing can make a Lego car.

337
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:45,869
Rym: It's made of Legos.

338
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:52,461
Rym: It's like a robots making robots, you know when robots make robots That's generally not going to end.

339
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:53,790
Rym: Well if they know what they're doing.

340
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:56,825
Rym: Yeah, the same, you know, well know what happened when people made people.

341
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:57,549
Rym: it wasn't good.

342
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:07,710
Rym: So anyway, we decided in spirit of the new year We're not gonna do what every other goddamn podcast did and do some sort of retrospective about 2006.

343
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,642
Scott: Yeah, we're not gonna tell you the best of or the worst of or whatever.

344
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,946

00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,562
Scott: I read it.

00:23:58,663 --> 00:23:59,770
Scott: I read like two crappy ones.

Scott: I think what is secret mean?

373
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,679
Rym: Decret means a secret that you're ashamed of.

374
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,705
Rym: Ooh, I like that a lot.

375
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:15,598
Rym: dark secret combined into Decret That's that's very Japanese.

376
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:21,896
Scott: it is the way they say like lolicon instead of you know What pedophilia?

377
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,807
Scott: well, we know lolicon is Rym's Decret.

378
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,448
Rym: Okay, well we've all we've got our katsu.

379
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:31,595
Rym: It's not a Decret.

380
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:32,780
Rym: It's not even a secret.

381
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,588
Scott: with best place to buy computers.

382
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,274
Scott: still new egg Yeah, all right.

383
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,462
Rym: back in the day used to be what TC computers.

384
00:24:38,482 --> 00:24:39,546
Scott: No, it doesn't even count.

385
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,770
Rym: or egghead calm.

386
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:46,710
Rym: Yeah, all right anyway, so we decided instead we would tell a geek fable something we haven't done in a while.

387
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,856
Rym: Oh gasps, you see this.

388
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,643
Scott: Oh that sucks for all you people looking for zombies.

389
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:54,310
Scott: part two, you know better luck next time.

390
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:55,856
Rym: I was all set to do zombies.

391
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:59,729
Rym: I can do zombies any day any time, but Scott Scott really doesn't want it.

392
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,799
Rym: He's really keeping us back here.

393
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:04,130
Scott: No, I just want to keep all the zombie people in suspense.

394
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:07,206
Rym: You know, it's not hard to keep zombie people in suspense.

395
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:07,870
Scott: That's the point.

396
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,476
Scott: It doesn't take much effort and it's fun.

397
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:13,852
Rym: cuz I mean it is not if you run around the corner away from zombies and the Zombies are coming.

398
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:17,523
Rym: You've got like five minutes before they get around that corner.

399
00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:20,690
Scott: And those are a suspenseful fucking five minutes All right.

400
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:22,858
Rym: So what we I mean this year?

401
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:32,490
Rym: you might have noticed that we took a bunch of days off for the show Because we threw as we have for the last two years now a crazy party in our house.

402
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:36,370
Scott: I think we threw one three years ago, but it wasn't in this house.

403
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:41,190
Rym: Yeah, and before that I really remember I was thinking I wasn't drunk either.

404
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,257
Rym: well I was going because I've never been drunk at work.

405
00:25:43,297 --> 00:25:47,834
Rym: today all the New Year's is we've had and I've got pretty much the Chronology of all of them.

406
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:51,210
Rym: that matter you see our first New Year's gatherings.

407
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:54,903
Rym: We're not the most well thought-out or awesome things.

408
00:25:54,983 --> 00:26:04,310
Rym: In fact many of them sucked balls Quite and over the years we learned what was wrong with our gatherings and we refined them.

409
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:15,910
Rym: We refined them and finally now that we live here in the giant geek house We were able to have perhaps the penultimate awesome party because the ultimate party would require us renting out an anime convention over New Year's.

410
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,036
Scott: Mmm, that'd be good stuff.

411
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:20,970
Rym: Yeah, you know, there isn't a New Year's anime con is there?

412
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,579
Scott: I don't think people would go.

413
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:28,490
Rym: I have this feeling, you know I think that could be a small to lower mid-level con if marketed properly.

414
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,890
Rym: Maybe you'd have to market it to the same kind of people who go to katsu-kan like the slightly older.

415
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:35,297
Rym: I think you just have to you would.

416
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:36,221
Scott: you couldn't call it a con.

417
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:38,994
Scott: you have to be like we're gonna have the ultimate geek New Year's party.

418
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:40,902
Scott: come to the geek New Year, huh?

419
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:42,610
Rym: That bears further consideration.

420
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:43,810
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

421
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:52,135
Rym: So we thought we just kind of go through the various New Year's is we've had and the pros and cons of all of them Because many of them ended in hilarity.

422
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,142
Scott: Well in the early college days.

423
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,650
Scott: I spent New Year's going home, you know.

424
00:26:56,751 --> 00:27:03,851
Rym: Yeah our freshman year We all went home partly because we lived in the dorms and RIT does this wonderful thing where they close the dorms and turn Off the heat.

425
00:27:04,353 --> 00:27:04,613
Rym: great.

426
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:13,023
Rym: So if you try to stick around campus over over the holiday, you know Christmas Kwanzaa New Year's break You'll just freeze to death if you don't get locked out.

427
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,318
Scott: They change the locks and everything You might get locked in which is even worse.

428
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,542
Rym: It wouldn't be so bad.

429
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:18,446
Rym: But like here's Greenwood.

430
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:19,510
Rym: I'll tell you froze to death.

431
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:21,057
Scott: Yeah, not not so good.

432
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:22,644
Scott: If you watch that part of here is Greenwood.

433
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:30,406
Rym: Yeah, so we uh well, I know I went back home to Michigan and had a Somewhat lame New Year's party with a bunch of people.

434
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:34,942
Scott: I knew in high school I had an average New Year's that year mostly like the New Year's kick came before.

435
00:27:35,424 --> 00:27:42,692
Rym: so the next year we decided You know We'd made some friends and we had some friends that we really respected and they said that they were gonna have some sort of New Year's party.

436
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:43,657
Scott: was that the next year?

437
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:44,842
Scott: I think that was two years later.

438
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:45,646
Rym: I think that was the next.

439
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:46,991
Scott: I don't really remember All right.

440
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:48,998
Rym: Well the nice relevant party.

441
00:27:49,158 --> 00:27:56,346
Rym: Yes, and this is the one we'll start talking about some of our friends said yeah We'll have a New Year's party at our apartment because we have the best apartment for that.

442
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:58,447
Rym: and we all said, you know What cool will show up?

443
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:01,280
Rym: So, you know, we don't even really think about it.

444
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,626
Rym: we assume they're throwing a party.

445
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:03,570
Rym: we'll just show up at it.

446
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,234
Rym: It'll be great.

447
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:05,441
Rym: These people are really cool.

448
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:06,870
Rym: There's no way they could throw a lame party.

449
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:13,090
Rym: So we get there, you know that day and no one's there Oh turns out they're out of town.

450
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,290
Rym: They're gonna be back that evening the evening of New Year's Eve.

451
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:18,523
Rym: So we wait and there's like one person.

452
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:19,770
Rym: the apartment was kind of sitting around.

453
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:26,650
Rym: We brought some food some snacks and some champagne which I'll say now didn't get opened at all.

454
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:28,337
Rym: Nope, nothing.

455
00:28:28,758 --> 00:28:29,622
Rym: So we're waiting.

456
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:35,370
Rym: we're waiting and a couple more people show up But the people hosting the party have not showed up yet and there's not too many people there.

457
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:42,498
Scott: I mean people are showing up but there's basically an equal number of people who live there and An equal number of people who are there for a party.

458
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,670
Scott: There were like eight people not even less than that.

459
00:28:46,372 --> 00:28:50,950
Scott: Well by the end there were eight people and we were sitting around like watching TV or something else lame.

460
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,122
Rym: Yeah, we started playing a couple of GameCube games.

461
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:54,350
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty ass.

462
00:28:54,712 --> 00:29:05,530
Rym: So eventually at like 1150 they come in the door Mmm, and we're all sitting there and we're looking at him and they don't even be like, hey, sorry, we're late.

463
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,439
Rym: Hey happy new year.

464
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:10,564
Rym: They're like, oh Hey, and we sit there and we're like Hey.

465
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:21,324
Rym: And then the blue man group comes on the TV to do a little performance and we all stood around silently watching the blue man group count down the new year and Then we stood around for another 10 minutes.

466
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:24,019
Rym: We went home We went to bed and that was that.

467
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:28,882
Rym: that was perhaps the lamest Evening of my entire life.

468
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:30,130
Scott: That wasn't the lamest.

469
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,624
Scott: I mean my lamest was like eating Chinese food alone on Christmas in Rochester.

470
00:29:34,745 --> 00:29:36,974
Scott: I Was lame.

471
00:29:37,095 --> 00:29:38,082
Rym: I feel bad now.

472
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:43,360
Scott: Okay, so anyway What's the moral of this new year?

473
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,667
Scott: seeing as this is a geek fable?

474
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:56,990
Rym: Well Part of the moral I think would be if someone else is throwing an event and you have no control over it Do an accurate assessment of their ability to project awesome and plan accordingly.

475
00:29:57,674 --> 00:30:00,209
Scott: Yeah, ask them like, you know, what's gonna be going down?

476
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,650
Rym: Well, I guess it depends on how much you trust them.

477
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,170
Rym: I mean if you just trust someone you just show up at their house.

478
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,249
Rym: Do you know something's gonna happen?

479
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:21,230
Rym: But if you don't trust him ask or more importantly don't go to parties that give all the signs of not being awesome Mmm, because the odds are they won't be like if you're expecting a party and you show up at the house And you don't see partying.

480
00:30:22,011 --> 00:30:23,670
Scott: Like don't stick around.

481
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:33,276
Rym: Yes See this was before the Otakon and all that where we realized that if people suck you have to drop them like Bags of dirt.

482
00:30:33,618 --> 00:30:35,510
Scott: That's I don't know but like a hot potato.

483
00:30:36,271 --> 00:30:37,076
Rym: Hot potatoes are great.

484
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:38,383
Rym: You don't drop that you eat that shit.

485
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,816
Scott: You don't hold on to it though You got to put it on a plate and wait.

486
00:30:40,957 --> 00:30:43,368
Rym: No you toss it from hand to hand periodically taking a bite.

487
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,754
Rym: You know, you do you drop.

488
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:46,798
Rym: burn your mouth that way.

489
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:49,790
Rym: you drop it like dog poop that somehow ended up in your hands.

490
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,378
Rym: Okay, you drop wipe and run.

491
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:53,241
Rym: Yeah.

492
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:56,290
Rym: Yeah, so we the what we should have done.

493
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,917
Rym: Here's how this party would have done.

494
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:02,008
Scott: poop on your hands is actually better than on your shoe or your clothes because you can get It off pretty easily.

495
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:02,629
Scott: You know what?

496
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:07,930
Rym: I have to agree because I've spent many a day picking dog poop out of the bottom of my shoe with a stick.

497
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:10,279
Scott: I've also spent many a day doing the same.

498
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:10,761
Scott: You know what?

499
00:31:10,942 --> 00:31:12,147
Rym: There's always still something.

500
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:13,010
Scott: there's always still something there.

501
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,921
Scott: You got to use a hose and a better steak.

502
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:16,450
Rym: All right, okay.

503
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,079
Rym: So here's how this would have gone down.

504
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,117
Rym: now being older and wiser one We probably wouldn't have even gone.

505
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:23,530
Rym: we would have thrown a competing party, but say we were lame.

506
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,485
Rym: Whatever we ended up going we show up and there's no one there.

507
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:27,530
Rym: We'd probably wait an hour.

508
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,901
Rym: No power maybe because we show up early in the day.

509
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:31,724
Scott: Okay.

510
00:31:32,086 --> 00:31:33,190
Rym: No one shows up in an hour.

511
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:45,460
Rym: We try to get a hold of the people throw in the party If the answer they give is not awesome enough or if we don't get a hold of them We gather everyone who's at the party we say screw this We're going to blah and having our own party.

512
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:45,902
Rym: who's with?

513
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:47,830
Scott: or we go to find another party.

514
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,429
Scott: I mean if you're at a college or something, it's not hard to find a party.

515
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,488
Scott: No, not you find someone, you know.

516
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,299
Scott: Maybe you can find someone that you.

517
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,490
Scott: maybe they're not your friend like directly But they're a friend of a friend or you know them from a class.

518
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,222
Scott: You worked on a project with them or just and they were cool

519
00:32:03,302 --> 00:32:04,930
Rym: nothing else wander around campus

520
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:07,947
Scott: Yep, you'll find some people holding red cups going

521
00:32:07,988 --> 00:32:15,685
Rym: woo Yeah, and I mean if nothing nothing else just go home with all the people who were also Burned by this crap party and have a party.

522
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:27,520
Rym: Yep Alright, so after that moment the next day We're those of us who went to this and got burned by it or sitting around and they had kind of a like mini After-party the next day, but it was over.

523
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:29,407
Rym: they had already failed in terms of New Year's.

524
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:34,205
Rym: Yep So we decided alright that will never happen again next year.

525
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:35,750
Scott: Let's freakin do something.

526
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:41,230
Rym: So we planned and by we planned and planned we decided eventually that what we were gonna do is we were gonna get everyone who?

527
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,429
Rym: Wanted to be cool together.

528
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:50,573
Rym: We were gonna carpool to Niagara Falls because Niagara Falls is a rockin town and there's no way we wouldn't have a good time in Niagara Falls Mm-hmm.

529
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:52,801
Rym: So we gathered up a good number of people.

530
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:58,081
Rym: actually we went in a bunch of two cars Two cars that were crammed stock full of people.

531
00:32:58,522 --> 00:33:00,530
Rym: Yep, and we went up to Niagara Falls.

532
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:05,470
Rym: We parked at the casino and we wander off into the street looking for a place to get Canadian dollars.

533
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,444
Scott: Now if only we were 21 that casino would have been good stuff Scott.

534
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:11,848
Rym: We could have gambled.

535
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:12,490
Rym: It's Canada.

536
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:13,635
Scott: Oh, right.

537
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:14,901
Scott: Yeah, why didn't we?

538
00:33:15,463 --> 00:33:16,890
Rym: because no we'll get to that.

539
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:26,685
Scott: Okay The same reason we didn't seem to remembering like we couldn't get or didn't gamble for some reason and I like that would have been Okay, if we did no, no, in fact some of all I remember.

540
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:27,047
Scott: why.

541
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:28,644
Scott: okay keep going I'll say it when it comes.

542
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:32,202
Rym: All right All right, so we don't go to the casino cuz I've been to the casino before.

543
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:34,190
Rym: it is not my favorite casino by any stretch.

544
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:36,240
Rym: It's not a great casino and it's full of smoke.

545
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:36,702
Scott: Yep.

546
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:38,250
Rym: So we got into the street.

547
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:39,610
Rym: We wander around a while.

548
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:47,410
Rym: eventually We go to get Canadian money and I get like a hundred bucks worth of Canadian dollars because I figured that'll do me and I Can use my credit card for anything else like drinks at a bar.

549
00:33:47,711 --> 00:33:50,220
Scott: I also got a fistful of Canadian dollars now up.

550
00:33:51,002 --> 00:33:58,772
Rym: a couple of our friends didn't even bother Getting Canadian money or if they did got it in very small quantities They must.

551
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:01,101
Scott: they were either poor college students or cheap.

552
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:02,144
Scott: I think both.

553
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:03,770
Rym: we didn't even think about this at the time.

554
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,867
Rym: Remember I was poor but I had at least some money at this time.

555
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:10,902
Rym: Yep So we're going around and then we decide alright, let's go get some dinner.

556
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:12,630
Rym: We go to a really awesome restaurant.

557
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:13,915
Scott: It was all fancy.

558
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:16,362
Scott: It wasn't crowded, but the food was awesome.

559
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:17,065
Scott: Yes.

560
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:18,310
Scott: The dessert was awesomer.

561
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:25,498
Rym: In fact, that was the first time any of us had encountered a chimney, which is the awesome Which is basically everything in the world on top of a banana.

562
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,120
Scott: Yep.

563
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:32,074
Scott: It's a fried cheesecake banana ice cream Syrup caramel.

564
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:33,641
Rym: Oh my with the cherry.

565
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,980
Scott: It's hot and cold and Cheese cake.

566
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:44,217
Rym: it was in fact I remember when we were there and there's a lot of us sitting around this table and the waitress is like you want any dessert We're all like no, we're good.

567
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:46,530
Rym: And she says have you ever had a chimney?

568
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,033
Rym: we're like what.

569
00:34:47,396 --> 00:34:53,364
Rym: and she explains what a chimney is and By the end of her feel every single person at the table wanted one.

570
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:54,889
Rym: Yep, which was a mistake.

571
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,217
Rym: We probably got in half as many.

572
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,143
Rym: those things were gigantic.

573
00:34:57,366 --> 00:34:58,010
Scott: They're awesome.

574
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:03,369
Rym: So the bill turned out to be like over 200 bucks Canadian soaking like five bucks back then.

575
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:08,170
Rym: But it was a decent amount of money and Scott and I didn't think much of it.

576
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,386
Rym: I mean, we weren't rich we weren't terribly poor, but we weren't that.

577
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:13,490
Rym: well, I mean it was enough.

578
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:15,721
Rym: Yeah, we had enough money to have more fun.

579
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:17,249
Scott: I expected to pay that much.

580
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:22,770
Rym: So it turned out that many of the other people with us spent their last couple of dollars on this meal.

581
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:25,009
Rym: But we'll get to why that fucked us.

582
00:35:25,672 --> 00:35:29,450
Rym: So then we wander on Niagara Falls, you know, we look at the frozen Falls and all the lights.

583
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:40,010
Rym: There's this nice Christmas thing and we're wandering around just having a good time in the street talking to people looking at things Going to cheesy cheesy tourist stuff that's free and looking at it and poking it and walking around.

584
00:35:40,693 --> 00:35:42,541
Rym: We still got plenty of time before the new year.

585
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:48,637
Rym: It's not even dark out yet and Then it starts to get dark and a few of the people start complaining that it's cold.

586
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:50,180
Scott: It was kind of cold.

587
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:57,918
Scott: However, I Inside action, it's mostly walk around the street.

588
00:35:58,019 --> 00:35:58,821
Scott: outside action.

589
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:01,870
Scott: Yeah, so plus there's a lot of running water there on there.

590
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:04,081
Scott: Yes, and it makes it a little colder.

591
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:05,789
Rym: plus this wind started picking up.

592
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,809
Rym: Yeah, so a few people in the group are complaining that it's cold.

593
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:11,276
Rym: Why aren't we inside somewhere?

594
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:12,159
Rym: Why are we outside?

595
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:15,410
Rym: and our response was we came to Niagara Falls?

596
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,130
Rym: Probably if nothing else to look at Niagara Falls, which is outside.

597
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:22,570
Rym: Got a plan accordingly.

598
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:25,358
Scott: Yeah, why aren't you wearing warmer clothing?

599
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,734
Rym: So whatever we're hanging out and eventually half the party decides You know what?

600
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:37,789
Rym: Fuck this and they abandon us Crammed more people into the second car than could possibly have fit comfortably and drove home.

601
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:41,510
Scott: Well, that was good for us because we drove home is gonna be nice and cozy.

602
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:50,702
Rym: So the few of us who remained decided All right Now that now that the poor people are gone and now that the complaining people are gone We're gonna have an awesome time.

603
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:52,867
Rym: now at this point I'll note that we weren't them.

604
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,456
Rym: We weren't that wise yet to the ways of the world.

605
00:36:56,078 --> 00:37:10,347
Rym: and we're walking around and we see a balcony and there are rather Attractive women hanging out with rather attractive men up on this balcony holding drinks and wearing party hats And they look down to us and they wave and they're like, hey, come

606
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:11,830
Scott: on up Whoa,

607
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,290
Rym: and they look like they're having a great time and they're all rather attractive.

608
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:16,306
Scott: And I wasn't just getting.

609
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:25,190
Scott: you know There are a lot of places around where there were just people Drinking and screaming and I wasn't really into the drinking and screaming but it looked like this place had a dance party and I was Like

610
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:28,286
Rym: oh, yeah, so I mean we heard good techno coming out of there

611
00:37:28,306 --> 00:37:28,768
Scott: and everything.

612
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:33,410
Rym: Yep So we go in we figure out, you know, this back alley we figure out the way to get into this place.

613
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,979
Rym: There's a bouncer standing there a little line.

614
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,670
Scott: I think it was actually a hard rock cafe.

615
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:38,521
Rym: No, it was next to the hard rock cafe.

616
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:39,930
Scott: Okay, the hard rock cafe.

617
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,464
Rym: We walked by and they wanted like 30 bucks to get in.

618
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:43,450
Rym: so we gave him the finger.

619
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:47,263
Rym: Okay, so we get to this place and the bouncer is there.

620
00:37:47,303 --> 00:37:53,970
Rym: so we all get in line and halfway through the line Some of the people in the party say something to the effect of is there a cover the drift pay to get it here?

621
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:58,124
Rym: And we're like probably and it comes down to wait a minute.

622
00:37:58,245 --> 00:37:59,007
Rym: We don't have any money.

623
00:37:59,047 --> 00:37:59,609
Rym: We can't go in.

624
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:04,929
Scott: Yeah, me and River standing there with money like wanting to pay to go in like we're going in.

625
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,882
Scott: People with us are like we can't pay.

626
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:10,710
Scott: to go in if you go in would be stuck out here.

627
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:12,899
Rym: Now it's pretty much like two people who couldn't go in.

628
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,803
Rym: so it's not like.

629
00:38:13,843 --> 00:38:18,384
Rym: it was just us who had money Yeah, but we couldn't abandon the people who didn't have money.

630
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:19,570
Rym: I mean that would have been assholish.

631
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,798
Scott: It would have been as I see.

632
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:27,410
Scott: but the thing is back in those days We had not let your yet learn the plan of you know, drop people off by the side.

633
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,738
Rym: Well also because it was our planned event.

634
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,927
Rym: We had no right to leave people behind.

635
00:38:31,947 --> 00:38:39,023
Rym: Yeah, I guess I mean if we say we're going to show people a good time and We fail to take into account every factor.

636
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:39,927
Rym: We'll deal with that.

637
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:41,876
Rym: Yeah Yeah, which might?

638
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:44,190
Scott: it's only because we said things already.

639
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:48,404
Scott: Yeah, if we hadn't said things if it was just we're going to Niagara Falls who wants to come?

640
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:50,370
Scott: then we could have totally dropped Him.

641
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,821
Rym: yeah, but we definitely convinced a lot of people to come.

642
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:53,163
Scott: Yep.

643
00:38:53,525 --> 00:39:08,870
Rym: So what we ended up doing after you know wandering around the sides for a while is Go into this outdoor bar with no cover and had these big heat lamps and we stood around him Having a couple of beers or a couple of non-alcoholic beverages talking and it was generally a good time.

644
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:13,920
Rym: And then we all stood up yelled Happy New Year stood around for another 10 minutes and went home.

645
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:19,600
Rym: Of course the on the way home we had some trouble.

646
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:22,829
Rym: Oh, yeah, you see there's no moral here.

647
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:26,001
Rym: Scott was driving and the rest of us were intoxicated.

648
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:26,523
Rym: Mm-hmm.

649
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:30,142
Rym: We pull up to the border and Scott I'll be the border guard and you beat you.

650
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:31,049
Scott: All right.

651
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:33,516
Rym: so, uh, when did you get into Canada?

652
00:39:34,057 --> 00:39:36,944
Rym: earlier today and How long were you there?

653
00:39:37,526 --> 00:39:38,308
Scott: until just now?

654
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:44,597
Rym: and the guy stands there for a second and he gives us this look of Somebody's gonna get hurt.

655
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:47,707
Scott: But I answered those questions.

656
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,794
Scott: Like I thought those are perfectly valid answers.

657
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,800
Scott: I wasn't trying to be wise or anything.

658
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:58,639
Scott: It wasn't until like a minute after saying what I said that I realized uh, did that sound like kind of like snarky?

659
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:00,484
Scott: Cuz I just died.

660
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:01,849
Scott: Those are my honest answers.

661
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,375
Scott: I was like I got here earlier today.

662
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:04,620
Scott: I'm leaving now.

663
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,698
Scott: Hey That's what what he want to know.

664
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:10,664
Scott: How many hours?

665
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:11,286
Scott: I don't know.

666
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,691
Rym: six eight.

667
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:13,736
Scott: I don't know.

668
00:40:13,876 --> 00:40:14,900
Rym: So we grilled us for a while.

669
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:15,707
Rym: Why are we there?

670
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:17,060
Rym: and you know, we gave normal answers.

671
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,660
Scott: But you know everyone in the car puts their IDs up and then you get them all back and you go home.

672
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:22,095
Scott: You go home.

673
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:29,023
Rym: Yeah Now also before that the one good like really good thing that happened was and I can't believe we didn't mention this but before everyone Gave up on it.

674
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:33,279
Rym: We went into this bar slash arcade where there was a DDR machine.

675
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,410
Rym: Oh, he played some drunken DDA played a bunch of drunken DDR.

676
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,173
Rym: It was great fun.

677
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,979
Scott: I wasn't drunken so I displayed regular DDR.

678
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:40,670
Rym: Yeah, I played drunken DDR and I did.

679
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,220
Scott: I mean I think it was a fifth mix machine.

680
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:45,874
Rym: It was and this was before we were that like we weren't super super good at D.

681
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:47,300
Scott: Yeah, this is a fifth mixes news.

682
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:49,628
Scott: It was hot and I was playing like basic.

683
00:40:50,129 --> 00:40:52,136
Rym: Yeah, I played like one or two trick songs.

684
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:53,240
Rym: I was happy with myself.

685
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:54,931
Rym: Yep, so the more.

686
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:56,300
Rym: now there's two morals here.

687
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:09,277
Rym: The first moral is if you're gonna do something like that You got a plan ahead and you've got a plan ahead for all the people coming with you because Anyone on a trip who fucks up you can't just leave them behind in Canada.

688
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:11,356
Rym: Nope So you've got to deal with them.

689
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:21,107
Rym: you make sure that everyone with you on a trip where any one person can screw you is ready to deal with the consequences of being screwed or Is not going to screw you.

690
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:30,458
Scott: it's like this if you go to amusement park And you bring three people in your car and not everyone can afford to get into the amusement park you have a problem.

691
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:37,905
Rym: Yes Now if one of those people say said they had enough money and it turned out they didn't and then they decided they didn't want To go into the amusement park.

692
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:43,520
Rym: Anyway, knowing full well that you would leave them behind Well, you leave them in the parking lot all day to die in the heat.

693
00:41:43,861 --> 00:41:57,710
Scott: Yeah, but I'm just saying you know, if if you say hey, let's all go here and it's not you know In advance like, you know big monies and you're not willing to pay for people and there's hidden expect Oh semi hidden expenses, then that's a problem.

694
00:41:58,051 --> 00:42:00,660
Rym: moral number two, and we didn't realize this until later.

695
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:12,105
Scott: Oh, like I guess it also counts like if you go somewhere and then like Anyone over a certain only people like six feet tall and taller allowed in and you bring some five feet people with you And you didn't know that rule existed.

696
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,249
Scott: You can't.

697
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:15,857
Scott: it would be kind of bad to go inside.

698
00:42:15,878 --> 00:42:21,780
Rym: Yeah So the moral number two and we figured that we didn't really worry about it we didn't think about it We didn't get into that party.

699
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:32,079
Rym: But in retrospect being older and wiser we realized that that party was most likely hiring those people to stand at the balcony and trick people into paying the covering going in.

700
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:33,805
Rym: and There's a good chance.

701
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:34,990
Rym: There was a totally lame party.

702
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:44,140
Rym: That's a very very common tactic Especially in places along the Canadian border where Americans who aren't old enough to drink in America But are old enough to drink in Canada frequent.

703
00:42:44,281 --> 00:42:48,100
Scott: Well any place where there's college students hanging out for a party does that kind of thing?

704
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:55,628
Rym: So if you see people who are very attractive hanging out in an obvious You know hip awesome way in a balcony.

705
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:58,980
Scott: that's visible because I mean you don't get to go on balconies and hang out.

706
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:00,505
Scott: I mean, what have you ever gone to?

707
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:04,420
Scott: a party where there was like a balcony and you could totally go be awesome on it?

708
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,487
Scott: And you know and when were you out there?

709
00:43:06,547 --> 00:43:09,718
Scott: like inviting people from the street to come up who were just schmucks.

710
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:11,326
Scott: never I don't think anyone.

711
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:18,117
Rym: so while we fail to get into that place We can't blame the people who caused us to fail because they actually saved us 15 Canadian dollars.

712
00:43:18,459 --> 00:43:22,320
Rym: Yep So then we had a couple other random New Year's parties.

713
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,073
Rym: We tried to just have one in our colony apartment which went okay.

714
00:43:25,113 --> 00:43:26,540
Rym: their apartment was too small to do much.

715
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:39,800
Scott: So I guess the other moral is if you're a geek looking for geek action And you go somewhere where all there is is drinking and going whoo It's not gonna be too much awesome there for you not at all.

716
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,928
Scott: I mean the DDR was the awesomest part.

717
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:45,020
Scott: we should have just stayed and played DDR the whole time we did for a while though.

718
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,271
Scott: Yep, we should have spent the whole time playing DDR.

719
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,294
Scott: Yeah, right out of money.

720
00:43:49,354 --> 00:43:51,080
Rym: It was like two Canadian bucks a game though.

721
00:43:51,202 --> 00:43:56,516
Rym: Yeah, it was too much anyway Alright, so then you know we don't really tell the story of our geek house parties other than that.

722
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,157
Rym: once we had a house That was big enough.

723
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,971
Rym: Immediately that New Year's house isn't big enough.

724
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:01,413
Rym: Well.

725
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:02,278
Rym: It was big enough.

726
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:02,700
Rym: now

727
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:03,921
Scott: Barely

728
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:21,430
Rym: considering that much of the front row our house was filled beyond capacity this past weekend We could not have comfortably dealt with any more people and in fact We could not have comfortably dealt with the people we had mm-hmm the our house was an unmitigated Disaster and we're just now finishing cleaning it up.

729
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,919
Scott: not even we're halfway done cleaning it up.

730
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,312
Rym: I think yeah, I still got a mop a couple times.

731
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:27,940
Rym: then we got a steam clean the apartment.

732
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:29,339
Scott: I got to clean them bathrooms.

733
00:44:29,822 --> 00:44:33,820
Scott: I purposefully didn't clean them before people came because I knew they were gonna mess them all up.

734
00:44:33,982 --> 00:44:34,873
Scott: Yeah, and they did.

735
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:40,560
Rym: now We're not gonna talk about how we ran an awesome party because that would be a whole different episode on how to run a party.

736
00:44:40,942 --> 00:44:48,739
Scott: Just let it be said that if you want an awesome party to happen There's that rule that always applies if you want something done right do it yourself.

737
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,969
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

738
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:00,154
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.
