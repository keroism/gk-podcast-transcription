1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,292
Rym: It's Tuesday September 5th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,059
Rym: We complain about that old classic hero quest.

3
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:18,697
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:24,056
Rym: Well, we're back from a wonderful labor day weekend where we pretty much just labored over board games.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,045
Scott: Ah Sweet laboring.

6
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:31,520
Rym: I got to say labor day used to mean a lot more to me when I had school the next day.

7
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:34,974
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I mean I did a lot of.

8
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:41,020
Scott: actually if I figure Mathematically I did more work on Labor Day than on today.

9
00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:51,560
Rym: Though the thing is I mean Emily is back now, which is wonderful But she was talking about how like she was getting ready for classes because she started school today.

10
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:57,529
Scott: Yeah I drove I drive by this high school on the way to work and There haven't been cars at it for months.

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,899
Scott: and today there were cars at it.

12
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,458
Rym: Yeah, and Emily was telling me about.

13
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,423
Rym: you know I took this class.

14
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,031
Rym: in this class you shown him her schedule and I was.

15
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:14,340
Rym: it's weird to think that I would ever even Dream of thinking something like this, but I was a little jealous cuz I kind of miss starting new classes.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:27,116
Scott: Yeah, it's like you remember You know the kind of feelings you got on the first day of school and around the country perhaps the world There are kids like that having those kind of feelings all this week and last week and next week.

17
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:29,965
Scott: and well for us It's normal days.

18
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:30,647
Rym: Yep.

19
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:33,255
Rym: My Tuesday was no different than my previous Tuesday.

20
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:34,980
Rym: I got up and I drove to Yonkers.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:45,329
Scott: I think part of why you know, I'm not a hundred percent satisfied with my current job is like, you know previously in life I'd have constant changes and things like okay.

22
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:46,271
Scott: I'm at school.

23
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:47,355
Scott: I'm at summer camp.

24
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:48,418
Scott: I'm at school now.

25
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:49,060
Scott: I'm somewhere else.

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,875
Scott: I'd keep changing changing up every you know twice a year even just in college.

27
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:54,999
Rym: different classes every 11 weeks.

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:04,522
Scott: Yeah, it's all over the place different classes breaks, you know going on trips to places, you know going on family vacations friend vacations You know.

29
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:18,163
Scott: now it's like sure I go to conventions here and there but I always return to the same thing and my Baseline is static and I need a baseline that goes all over the place to keep myself interested in life.

30
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:25,212
Rym: problem is baselines that go all over the place either aren't conducive to the lifestyle we live or Don't make enough money for us to live.

31
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:26,860
Scott: I know it really sucks.

32
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:35,559
Scott: I need to find a way to make money and also have a moving baseline Because really a moving baseline is is the kind of life I like.

33
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:52,645
Rym: Yeah Just I actually got a little jealous when she was explaining her classes to me like what she was taking because I remember I always Hated by classes at RIT because well I'd like signing up for classes and I like the first week of class because the first week nothing bad happens Nothing was assigned.

34
00:02:52,906 --> 00:03:06,782
Rym: You just meet your teachers and basically get to leave class early and hang out a bit Yeah, and then you know All the slacking off but I pretty much spend the rest of the quarter Hating my classes doing anything I can to get out of them early show up to them late Yeah, and

35
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:10,820
Scott: the description of what you're gonna learn and the anticipation of what you're gonna learn is great.

36
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,920
Scott: Then actually learning it is not so great except for like the few classes that are actually interesting.

37
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:19,013
Scott: Yeah, this is like is there's nothing I like more than learning.

38
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:22,950
Scott: but learning, you know The stuff they teach me in most of the classes is not stuff.

39
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,758
Scott: I enjoy learning or want to learn.

40
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:35,377
Rym: Scott I think I can name something that you possibly enjoy more than learning the one Form of learning I Enjoy learning.

41
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:39,029
Rym: See learning is a mad as a euphemism here.

42
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,380
Rym: Yeah for for autoerotic stimulation.

43
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,808
Scott: Hey, I enjoy things more than that.

44
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:50,458
Scott: Also speaking which I don't you're assuming that that doesn't involve learning New things.

45
00:03:51,381 --> 00:04:01,778
Rym: Whoever it was who posted in the forums a little while ago about some kind of story that involves some kind of monkey biting some child's um sexual member?

46
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:09,085
Rym: Yeah, I believe it was already posted as advice but you need to call Penn Jillette right now because I guarantee he'll put you on The radio.

47
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:10,620
Scott: Yeah, you need to do that quick.

48
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:23,360
Rym: And then when you're on the radio and you're telling the story You need to relate in the story that the only reason you called is because your friends over at GeekNights told you to All right, I'm not gonna be so shameless.

49
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:28,395
Scott: I'm not going to actually say you should do that because I have.

50
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:33,973
Scott: I want to you know Keep my shame or not have not have shame but cover.

51
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,558
Scott: I really really want you to do that.

52
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:36,160
Scott: That'd be awesome.

53
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:45,597
Rym: I mean the only thing it wouldn't be as useful But it'd be funnier if you just said all as many internet catchphrases as you possibly could.

54
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:46,580
Rym: oh really while you're on.

55
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,855
Rym: Yeah, really every time pen says ha ha like oh really like yeah, really?

56
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:56,460
Scott: Oh my god See the thing is I don't know if I could do that without just laughing hysterically.

57
00:04:57,002 --> 00:05:05,117
Rym: Talking Penn would be like something something something and I'd be like, yeah And then he'd probably ask why you're laughing and then you try to explain it.

58
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,328
Rym: Alright, we'll do something.

59
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,123
Rym: if you just call Penn Gillette and tell him about it on the show That'll be good enough.

60
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:18,053
Rym: If the word GeekNights comes up in your conversation.

61
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:28,070
Rym: You'll get a t-shirt when we make t-shirts yeah, and if if you do if you say GeekNights and You get in at least like five catchphrases.

62
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,093
Rym: I'll kiss you on the mouth.

63
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:29,615
Rym: You also got.

64
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:31,479
Scott: try to say front row crew calm Yeah.

65
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:39,962
Scott: if you don't say WWW though not because I don't think you should say it because I think you should but because Penn Gillette will yell at you and That'll kind of ruin it.

66
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:44,596
Rym: Yeah, of course, you could say it and the moment he says anything you say nope.

67
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:48,918
Rym: Shut up Penn WWW yeah, and that would be funny.

68
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:54,397
Scott: And then they'll find out that the guy who's are he gets WW is the guy that he's promoting.

69
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,631
Scott: and yeah It'll be this guy Michael Godot.

70
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:58,864
Rym: be like wait a minute Ram.

71
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:05,454
Scott: some guy keeps sending me angry emails about this Like yeah rims the guy who does this GeekNights' thing.

72
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,457
Scott: Oh What's up with that?

73
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:09,744
Rym: That would be.

74
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:14,288
Rym: or if you just said baba mooey baba mooey Rimming Scott's penis, you know what if he does?

75
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,995
Scott: if it's not if I don't hear it on the next monkey Tuesday or the one after That I'm going to call it in and pretend.

76
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:20,700
Scott: It's my story.

77
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,569
Scott: You know what make up a good story about a monkey biting a penis.

78
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,977
Rym: I will too and we'll both call in.

79
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:34,394
Rym: Yeah so fair anyway Because we don't have awesome new classes to take or school is starting or anything.

80
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:39,207
Rym: Today is just another day and All we did today was play or games.

81
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:40,390
Rym: Well one board game.

82
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:43,399
Rym: Yeah, which uh, hey to brag would.

83
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,200
Rym: no I don't absolutely love to freakin brag, but I'm on a goddamn roll when it comes to board games that involve bidding.

84
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:51,487
Rym: I've won like every game we played.

85
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:52,471
Rym: I bitch.

86
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:54,036
Scott: He doesn't really involve that much bidding.

87
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:55,300
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

88
00:06:55,942 --> 00:07:04,022
Rym: Every game it's always been me Scott and Alex because now that Alex lives with us we can play board games constantly Every game.

89
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,389
Rym: it's me and Alex and pretty much neck-and-neck.

90
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:08,234
Rym: and then Scott is way behind.

91
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:09,799
Scott: I wasn't way behind yesterday.

92
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:10,782
Scott: Yes you were.

93
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,605
Scott: No I wasn't.

94
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:12,609
Rym: Oh no you weren't.

95
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,656
Scott: I wasn't way behind the last time.

96
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:16,243
Scott: this two times ago We played Vinci.

97
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:19,620
Rym: Well you were way behind in raw at the very end when I got all those extra points.

98
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,746
Scott: No Because Alex is so far more behind.

99
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:27,081
Scott: like you had like 60 I had like 40 something and Alex had like 15.

100
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,668
Rym: Yeah, but Vinci you're not doing so well.

101
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,797
Scott: The latest Vinci I was to suck.

102
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:32,462
Scott: next time I will not to suck.

103
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:35,329
Rym: You were more than half a board away.

104
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:38,396
Scott: I was slightly less than half a board away.

105
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,951
Scott: I Just didn't add my points from the final turn.

106
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:47,420
Scott: wouldn't have been so many It wouldn't have been but it would have been less than half a board away.

107
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:57,120
Rym: Yeah, but in general it's weird because like I always win the games but Alex Oh, I mean he loses by like one point or like two points every time.

108
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:07,660
Rym: Yep, we're trying to figure out is because we're kind of converging on like being as good at the game as we can be or If it's just randomness because we are playing one?

109
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,820
Scott: He was actually good and one of you takes all my points and the question is how many points did you take away from me?

110
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,760
Rym: You realize in most three-player games, but you're involved in I usually think all right, how can I manipulate Scott?

111
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:23,698
Rym: Because you try and I do.

112
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:30,440
Rym: The only reason it works because you try so hard to not be manipulated by anyone That you tend to end up being manipulated by everyone.

113
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:35,456
Rym: It's no good because everyone will always say things knowing you'll do the exact opposite and that just becomes.

114
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:38,589
Scott: I just don't take what anyone Says into account and making my decision.

115
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:43,332
Scott: I just go by what I think is the Worst move at least in this game.

116
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,415
Scott: I did good two times ago.

117
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:47,938
Rym: You did well, I didn't know you didn't.

118
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,120
Scott: I did good deeds.

119
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,345
Rym: No, you didn't hit it.

120
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,315
Rym: You did nothing but conquer barbarians.

121
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:53,279
Scott: That's a good deed.

122
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:57,774
Rym: The barbarians a bad guy, but the barbarians in that game are nothing but peaceful.

123
00:08:58,135 --> 00:08:59,800
Scott: No, no, they're very not peaceful.

124
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,284
Rym: They sit there.

125
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:01,070
Rym: They got one guy.

126
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,914
Rym: No There were eight people.

127
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:05,873
Rym: Thank God All right.

128
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:07,520
Rym: Anyway, we got some news.

129
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:12,996
Scott: So there is a game a very somewhat old game called mech commander.

130
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:14,340
Scott: now we like them battle techs.

131
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,391
Rym: We used to play battle tech as often as we could at RIT which wasn't often.

132
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:26,720
Scott: No, but battle tech is awesome and The closest you can get to battle tech on the computer is well, there's a thing called.

133
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:28,085
Scott: What's it called?

134
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:29,751
Scott: It's called like something mech.

135
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:36,200
Scott: I forget I forget the name of it But it's like an open-source thing with a poor interface that lets you play battle tech on the computer.

136
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:37,880
Scott: Not the greatest thing in the world.

137
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:57,536
Scott: but there is mech commander which is a game made by Microsoft who owns the video game rights to battle tech because they bought the faster corporation and They made mech commander, which is essentially turn-based battle tech strategy kind of for the computer and It is now free.

138
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,714
Scott: So go to mech commander org and you can play mech commander for free.

139
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,037
Scott: download the full version.

140
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:04,799
Scott: Just there it is.

141
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,662
Scott: It's amazing.

142
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:16,060
Rym: Now these sorts of like playing these cut, you know robot fighting games tend to be very Realistic in the sense that that's how war kind of goes because it's mostly just kind of random.

143
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:19,540
Scott: Yeah, the thing battle tech is sort of a sci-fi.

144
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:27,525
Scott: What if we there, you know, we really did develop, you know, bipedal walking war machines What would they be like?

145
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:33,483
Scott: and this is it's a lot more realistic than say Gundam or Evangelion.

146
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:48,620
Scott: now Evangelion is perfectly real is not even close If the Christians are right, maybe yeah, this is likely the Jews Yeah, but it also has you know a crazy sci-fi outer space super futuristic universe with clans and things and whatnot.

147
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,370
Scott: But that is only the story and it doesn't involve in the game.

148
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:52,474
Rym: It's no gassaraki.

149
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:53,659
Scott: No, not really.

150
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:58,340
Scott: but Battle take a school mech commanders cool and it's free.

151
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,899
Scott: Hey grottus free not libra free.

152
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:06,779
Rym: All right This isn't video game related news.

153
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:11,519
Rym: But and I'm not getting this I'm this is now going to be subject to Jack Thompson syndrome.

154
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:12,703
Rym: in That I can't.

155
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:23,919
Rym: I won't talk about this again unless something crazy happens But I have to talk about this one because this is pretty much the final Straw that was nailed into the coffin that that broke the camel's back.

156
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:28,592
Rym: You know, the d-bold voting machines are totally broken and easily hacked.

157
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:29,735
Rym: everyone knows that.

158
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,140
Rym: it's been reported widely.

159
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:34,851
Rym: There are videos everywhere showing how absolutely trivial it is.

160
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:36,115
Scott: They had a monkey do it.

161
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:36,657
Rym: Yes.

162
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:37,680
Rym: That is not a joke.

163
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,588
Rym: They trained a monkey to manipulate the results of a d-bold voting machine Just now.

164
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:56,180
Rym: well a little while ago someone did a little photo blog and they got a hold of some d-bold equipment and There's this little seal thing that's supposed to show that no one was able to physically tamper with the memory card that holds the results.

165
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:58,373
Rym: And they were able now keep in mind.

166
00:11:58,393 --> 00:11:59,280
Rym: This isn't anyone special.

167
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,733
Rym: This isn't an engineer or anything with no training or skill or really anything whatsoever.

168
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,000
Rym: What about tools like a screwdriver?

169
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:18,588
Rym: They were able to trivially remove the seal do whatever they wanted to the memory card Put the memory card back and replace the seal as though it had never been removed Thus completely defeating the purpose of the seal.

170
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:24,084
Rym: it could be done one-handed in less than five minutes Awesome.

171
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:27,079
Rym: Now I'm wondering because a lot of places use these machines.

172
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,499
Rym: There's elections coming up and there's a lot of geeks who are pissed off about politics.

173
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,369
Rym: now I am NOT advocating that anyone do anything.

174
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,460
Rym: far be it for me to tell you to do something horribly illegal.

175
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:40,040
Rym: But wouldn't it be funny?

176
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,447
Scott: I mean you're behind a curtain in with voting.

177
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:51,907
Rym: wouldn't it be funny if a whole bunch of geeks all over the place just screwed with the results of every election they could and Some crazy third parties won?

178
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:54,877
Scott: not bad crazy third parties only good crazy.

179
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:55,560
Rym: There's the problem.

180
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:56,339
Rym: It's the internet.

181
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:03,100
Rym: So one activist would make like I don't know the Green Party win and then the next four guys would all make Chuck Norris win.

182
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:04,191
Scott: Oh, yeah.

183
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:07,767
Scott: Oh, yeah That'll be the right in but that's it.

184
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,720
Scott: If everyone in the whole town wrote in Chuck Norris for mayor.

185
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:14,239
Scott: Oh my god, that would be the best thing ever.

186
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,096
Rym: Either that or I just make 10 million.

187
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:18,407
Rym: by make it I mean, here's the thing.

188
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:23,858
Rym: if I were to do something like this Which I'm not and I'm not advocating that anyone do this because it is horribly illegal.

189
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,880
Rym: Yep I would make it so it showed I don't know a billion votes for like Ford Prefects.

190
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,900
Rym: That would be awesome because you don't want to actually manipulate the election.

191
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,520
Rym: You just want to show people that yeah, that machine was broken and it got hacked.

192
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:43,260
Scott: Yeah, if they if you do it to every voting machine in there.

193
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,067
Scott: so let's say your vote your local voting place has five d-ball voting machine.

194
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:50,535
Rym: in this hypothetical world five nerds.

195
00:13:50,836 --> 00:14:02,896
Scott: one goes in each booth and you hack each and every one of them and then You know that place will have to redo their election and they'll not use those machines the next time.

196
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,518
Scott: and if they redo the election Go in and hack it again.

197
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:08,788
Rym: Yeah, I just it bothers me.

198
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:09,289
Rym: they don't change.

199
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:12,380
Rym: it doesn't bother me so much that these voting machines are so bad.

200
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:23,740
Rym: What bothers me is that it's widely known among geeks and technologists that the voting machines are completely broken and hackable But the rest of the country has no idea and the news doesn't report on this at all.

201
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:24,603
Scott: Well, we don't.

202
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,371
Scott: I don't know what the news reports because I don't watch.

203
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,175
Rym: no one knows.

204
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:28,380
Rym: No one knows.

205
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,209
Rym: I defy you to find someone who doesn't read.

206
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,440
Scott: I think that this is finally time.

207
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:35,460
Scott: We should just take advantage of it and the geek should take over the country.

208
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:37,464
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

209
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:39,351
Rym: They probably just shoot us with their guns.

210
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:43,550
Scott: I mean we've all but if we vote We've all played a lot of counter-strike.

211
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:45,179
Rym: don't think that's gonna help so much.

212
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:49,918
Scott: But if we voted into power then one of us would be in charge of the armies and then we'd win.

213
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,052
Rym: Somehow I see the hypothetical plan that we're not in any way advocating failing exactly.

214
00:14:57,554 --> 00:14:57,734
Rym: Yes.

215
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:09,260
Scott: Once again, I'm not advocating that you in any way tamper with lecture results but go to You know the website that shows how to do it and watch it and carefully, you know.

216
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,559
Rym: What really bothers me is that it's so easy to make an electronic voting machine that works.

217
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:20,393
Rym: Yeah, you and I in a few days could make a complete voting machine.

218
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,297
Rym: That was absolutely untamperable.

219
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:26,588
Scott: Yeah, probably Let me the hard part would be machining it.

220
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:29,016
Rym: Yeah, but the software part is nothing.

221
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,240
Scott: the software part is trivial.

222
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:43,633
Scott: It has some memory enough to store two really big numbers, you know, well a bunch of really big numbers for all the candidates and It increments them whenever someone pushes a button Yeah and then digital signatures to make sure it hasn't been tampered with.

223
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:53,660
Rym: yeah and then you print out what someone voted for and it appears under glass and Then when they make their vote that piece of paper also gets stored in the machine.

224
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:56,431
Rym: So no matter what there's a perfect physical record.

225
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:56,993
Scott: Yep.

226
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:58,339
Scott: Just a big metal bucket.

227
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:04,616
Rym: Oh Deebold if you're listening, uh, I'll work for half whatever you paid your lowest paid engineer.

228
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:05,980
Rym: Yeah on your voting machines.

229
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:13,100
Scott: Yeah I would work for Deebold to design the voting machines that they paid me enough and They admitted that there are other voting machines are crap and took them back.

230
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:16,199
Rym: You don't even have to admit it publicly just admit it to me and I'll be happy.

231
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:18,066
Rym: Yeah, that's all I want.

232
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,478
Rym: I don't care if you lied everyone else, but don't lie to me.

233
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:26,697
Scott: and Also, let us know if you break the elections before that way, you know, yeah, I'm curious.

234
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:27,480
Scott: you can blow the whistle.

235
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:30,860
Rym: I mean, I don't care cuz John Kerry probably wouldn't have been the best president either.

236
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:33,312
Scott: They both suck, but it's not the point.

237
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,860
Rym: Yeah, that's not the point at all.

238
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:40,736
Rym: And for everyone who's been kind of asking what our political affiliations were if you can't figure that out.

239
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:50,776
Rym: I know Anyway things of the day.

240
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:52,000
Rym: Oh, yeah.

241
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:57,849
Rym: All right now the Mississippi State drum corps Did a pretty cool little?

242
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:05,030
Rym: Video game related show recently that made it to a Kotaku and there's a terrible barely watchable video of it.

243
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:08,362
Scott: Yeah, at first I thought they're real cool and it is really cool.

244
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,310
Scott: But the video does not do the justice.

245
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:11,750
Scott: In fact, it doesn't injustice.

246
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:21,730
Rym: well, basically the guy who filmed it is on the wrong side of the stadium and He's got a crappy camera with a crappy microphone and he's kind of far away.

247
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:29,530
Rym: Yeah However, you can kind of tell what's going on And once you realize what's going on you realize that had you been there it would have been pretty badass.

248
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,947
Rym: And Mississippi their marching band their core is very large as in 300 plus.

249
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:46,370
Rym: That is a lot of people marching and it's they can make very complex very detailed marching forms.

250
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,273
Rym: It's really cool to see.

251
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,442
Scott: I mean the buttons on there any as controller move.

252
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:51,410
Scott: Yeah, they had a cord on it.

253
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:53,799
Rym: They actually made a cord out of.

254
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:59,919
Rym: I'm not going to use the term we used for them when I was in high school But the flag car people Mm-hmm the flaggies.

255
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,427
Rym: No, no, no eggs.

256
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:04,066
Rym: now Okay, it's far worse than that.

257
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:13,950
Scott: Anyway So I found this cool game like it's funny that yeah It's funny that both of my I news and my thing of the day today are free games.

258
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:16,215
Scott: But so what's free now?

259
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,660
Scott: Well, it's not a game.

260
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,749
Scott: That was all that was not free and is now free.

261
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:24,829
Scott: But it's actually a game that is free and might become not free.

262
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:38,828
Scott: but There's a game some guy made called zombie city tactics and you can download the zombie city tactics For free from this guy's website.

263
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:39,030
Scott: now.

264
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:46,660
Scott: Zombie city tactics is like this incredibly simple Turn-based strategy game for the PC on Windows.

265
00:18:47,142 --> 00:19:17,410
Scott: I'm sure we'll run into wine just fine because it's just so simple and all you do is they start you in a scenario in which there are zombies and they're your guys and you basically you know you take your turn is a square grid and you move your guys and You can move them one space north south east west or diagonal or you can make them stand still and then the zombies move one Space and then you move one space now if a zombie moves on to your guy you die.

266
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:19,810
Scott: If you move on to a zombie it dies.

267
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:23,810
Scott: So the idea is you want to move your guys on to the zombies?

268
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:27,790
Scott: But you want to end your turn not being adjacent to zombies.

269
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:35,509
Scott: Now it gets a little interesting because you have some guys who can kill Zombies from one space away without moving on to them.

270
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:41,490
Scott: You have guys that can move two spaces and there's a zombie generator making a constant stream of zombies.

271
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:47,390
Scott: So I actually haven't figured out the pattern to beating the very first level yet.

272
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,056
Scott: I don't know if I'm an idiot or what.

273
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:54,776
Rym: I think you should apply your much vaulted skills at Vinci Yeah to solving this problem.

274
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,746
Scott: Yeah, I just I only tried it three times.

275
00:19:57,846 --> 00:20:04,547
Scott: I'm pretty sure with a little more effort I would have figured it out, but it's pretty hard until you figure out what to do.

276
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,210
Rym: See now Scott It's really interesting and simple.

277
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:10,581
Rym: I haven't played this game and I'll bet many of our listeners haven't played this game.

278
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:14,637
Rym: if even one of them solves it Right away.

279
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,990
Scott: I don't think you will do it on the first try.

280
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,675
Scott: However, I have one piece of advice.

281
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:19,879
Scott: read the.

282
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:24,065
Scott: read me because I didn't realize you could buy more units and stuff like that right away.

283
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,806
Scott: So, yeah, but it's a cool fun free game.

284
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:29,509
Scott: You should try it out.

285
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:30,954
Rym: You have learned.

286
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:34,490
Rym: well, my friends now is come the time of your first trial.

287
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:44,118
Rym: You must first enter the catacombs which contain foul mugs - you must seek out and destroy there Foul gargoyle who hides in these catacombs.

288
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,850
Rym: This quest is not easy and you must work together in order to survive.

289
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:51,480
Rym: This is your first step on the roads to becoming true heroes.

290
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,666
Rym: trade carefully my friends.

291
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:55,150
Scott: Hey, what if I don't go?

292
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,509
Rym: Well, then that just kind of fucks the whole game in the veritable ass now, doesn't it?

293
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,654
Scott: I think it does.

294
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,349
Scott: I don't see too much motivation for the characters here.

295
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:05,153
Scott: I know.

296
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:08,470
Scott: of course you should go into this catacomb and fight a gargoyle who never bothered them.

297
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,167
Scott: It doesn't even know who they are for no reason.

298
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,066
Rym: now Here's the important part that Alex did not read to us when we played the first time.

299
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:18,790
Rym: Okay, Zargon You may tell everyone that there are no traps or secret doors in this quest.

300
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:22,922
Scott: Oh, how did they know if that that means someone was down there already?

301
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:25,170
Scott: Yeah, I know that there's no secret doors or traps.

302
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:28,289
Rym: I got to say the best part of this game is the flavor text.

303
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:36,830
Scott: Yeah, wait, if we knew that that means someone's been down there Which means why do we have to go and fight if someone can already go down there survive and come back?

304
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:37,944
Scott: I don't get it.

305
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:39,555
Rym: You know what?

306
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:41,704
Rym: The game's not that well thought out.

307
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:43,230
Rym: the game it isn't.

308
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,982
Scott: I think that is the number one thing that can be said about this game.

309
00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:47,810
Rym: The game is hero quest.

310
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:49,778
Scott: Yes hero quest is.

311
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:50,963
Scott: it's a Milton Bradley, right?

312
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:52,750
Rym: It is a Milton Bradley.

313
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,031
Scott: It's.

314
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:59,159
Scott: it's an old Milton Bradley game that they I'm pretty sure they don't make anymore because they make hero escape now Which is something else entirely.

315
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:06,410
Rym: now the way hero quest works It is a game that's kind of like old-school beer and pretzel style D&D, but it comes in a box with everything you need.

316
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,801
Rym: One person plays god.

317
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,249
Rym: What's the stupid thing's name?

318
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,464
Rym: Zargon, you're basically the Dungeon Master.

319
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,650
Rym: you control all the monsters.

320
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:32,848
Rym: You have the book that I'm holding in my hand right now that shows you know where everything is and how to deal with everything Mm-hmm, and then You are basically adversarial to the party which consists of up to four people who play four different characters the elf the dwarf the barbarian and the wizard and

321
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:39,105
Scott: All you do really is there's a square grid and your old dice to see how much you move.

322
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:42,661
Scott: so every character moves and then The monsters move and then the characters move in.

323
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:45,234
Scott: the monsters move and if they're adjacent They can fight.

324
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:46,921
Scott: and your old dice to see how you fight.

325
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:48,990
Scott: and there's no levels or anything.

326
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,284
Scott: There's just equipment and you can search for treasure to get more equipment and gold.

327
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:56,865
Scott: and in between levels you can use gold to buy equipment.

328
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:58,809
Scott: and That's about it.

329
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,494
Scott: It's the players versus the Dungeon Master in a just dungeon crawl With.

330
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:08,370
Scott: and if there's gonna be any role-playing the game isn't gonna help you at all with that.

331
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,032
Scott: It's all you.

332
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:09,594
Rym: the game.

333
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,443
Rym: In fact kinda really prevents any sort of role-playing.

334
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:14,510
Rym: There's no way to talk to anyone you meet.

335
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:17,310
Rym: There is no way to bargain with anyone.

336
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,230
Rym: There is no way to in any way interact with anyone by any means other than your sword.

337
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:31,292
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much the only things you can do in this game are walk search for treasure search for traps search for secret doors and Fight.

338
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:40,810
Rym: now fighting is composed of attacking with a weapon or casting a spell possibly if you were at the kind of person who can cast spells and All of it pretty much comes down to randomness.

339
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:47,769
Scott: I mean you either play a card, you know And it just works or you roll some dice to see how much damage goes down.

340
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:56,658
Rym: Well, but it really comes down to is that it is a fun game for like a father to play with his kids Or a mother to play with his with her kids.

341
00:23:56,678 --> 00:24:05,515
Rym: or Like if I'm uncle Rym someday to someone's kids I'll run this game for them because little kids can have a lot of fun with this game.

342
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:11,775
Rym: and when I was a kid I actually played all of hero quest with my dad and my little brother and occasionally my mom.

343
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:13,319
Scott: Yeah, I didn't play until college.

344
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:24,189
Rym: Wow, see when I saw hero quest at our way I thought oh and this whole flood of memory came back because I played the barbarian and my little brother played the elf and occasionally my mom would play.

345
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,318
Rym: and when she did she was the dwarf.

346
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:36,528
Rym: and We went through the entire thing where my dad was the DM and he won played the game much more Evily than he probably could have.

347
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:37,972
Rym: he made basically the game.

348
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:43,010
Rym: the monsters are all complete chumps Except for the super badass monsters.

349
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:45,800
Scott: Yeah, basically every monster has one hit point.

350
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,346
Scott: So you just to hit it once and it dies.

351
00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:53,940
Scott: a few monsters have more hit a couple monsters have two and pretty much in Any dungeon most of the monsters you're gonna meet have one.

352
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:01,098
Scott: So you just kill them all and then this one boss who has more than one hit point I just gang up on him to beat him in like one or two turns.

353
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:08,045
Rym: now The only way the game is not broken really is if you play it with people who aren't gonna play the game Optimally like a bunch of kids.

354
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:12,240
Rym: They won't know the optimal way and they won't figure out the optimal way to beat this game.

355
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,043
Scott: Yeah, they'll have fun.

356
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:16,760
Scott: Just walking around exploring a dungeon rolling dice and moving a guy.

357
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,440
Scott: I mean if you like Candyland hero questions is that much better?

358
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:30,060
Rym: well, also the game is really well done in that it has a big board with a bunch of rooms on it and The game is revealed to you and each setup is different as you walk around

359
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,551
Scott: Yeah, and as things are revealed like this cool plastic furniture that comes.

360
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,340
Rym: Yeah, the props that come with this game are numerous.

361
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:43,160
Rym: However, I will note that the props while they're all fairly well done have absolutely no gameplay purpose whatsoever.

362
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:45,172
Scott: However, they can sometimes get.

363
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:46,399
Scott: well, no, that's not true.

364
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,488
Scott: Sometimes they give hints as to the treasure that is in the room and sometimes not as in there's a Treasure chest in the room.

365
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:55,640
Rym: if you search for treasure, you'll probably find something.

366
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:11,280
Scott: but sometimes the treasure chest in the room and you search the treasure and there isn't any and sometimes they'll be like a. You know a cabinet in the room and you'll search your treasure and it'll say in the in the bookcase you find whatever And it's like oh my god the flavor text match the furniture.

367
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:21,199
Rym: Yeah now I know later in the game because I don't remember everything but later in the game There's like one a fireplace and when you pull it it moves away and it makes a secret door and there's stuff back there.

368
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,363
Rym: Yeah Now the game is.

369
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:28,040
Rym: it's really only fun if you're a little kid and the game is made to be adversarial.

370
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,688
Rym: It's basically the Dungeon Master against the players.

371
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,394
Rym: It's not really balanced.

372
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:36,006
Rym: So the Dungeon Master is probably gonna lose It's not unless he cheats.

373
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:36,729
Rym: now.

374
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,220
Rym: when I played it was just me and my brother most of the time as a kid.

375
00:26:39,662 --> 00:26:43,760
Rym: So my dad basically had to play sub optimally or we would have just died.

376
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,735
Rym: So he just kind of made it fun for us kids.

377
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:49,852
Scott: Mm-hmm I think that's it either has to be that way or it doesn't work.

378
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:54,299
Scott: because I mean there's some games that are you know Just like this kind of like Dracula where?

379
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,063
Scott: Fury of Dracula.

380
00:26:56,103 --> 00:27:03,458
Scott: Dracula is sort of like the evil wizard and that you know, it's him versus the players but really he's just making the game interesting for the players.

381
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:05,485
Scott: or what's the doom?

382
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:11,457
Scott: where one guy controls the demons and the everyone else controls doom guys and you're controlling the demons you can win.

383
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:15,900
Scott: and Mutant Chronicles and all the other similar type games, you know.

384
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,537
Scott: But in hero quest the DM really can't win and the other games he can.

385
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:21,867
Rym: now There are a lot of expansions to this game.

386
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:27,219
Rym: There was a barbarian and an elf solo quest Whoa that Ryan as a kid.

387
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:31,174
Rym: there are also a whole bunch of other expansions that Alex has and I also had.

388
00:27:31,194 --> 00:27:36,152
Rym: and then there are Things like advanced hero quest which we won't talk about.

389
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:37,276
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

390
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:38,400
Scott: So we can't talk about it.

391
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:42,300
Rym: I never actually played it or saw it in person, but it looked real fancy.

392
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:53,140
Scott: Yep but generally the problem with hero quest is that if you are an intelligent person you will realize that number one monsters can't open doors.

393
00:27:54,006 --> 00:28:08,860
Scott: so in any given map if There aren't any you know monsters about like you've killed every monster that's you know Roaming the hallways and every monster in all the rooms You've already opened then there can't possibly be a monster unless you decide to search for treasure.

394
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:13,498
Rym: So I guess at this point what we'll do is we'll describe how we caused Alex to pull all of his hair out.

395
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:15,966
Scott: Yes, and so you have a map.

396
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:25,439
Scott: every door is closed and there are no monsters and which means Nothing can happen to the players unless they search for treasure or open a door.

397
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:28,799
Scott: Now you roll dice to see how many spaces you move.

398
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:36,950
Scott: well, if there are no monsters and you don't search your treasure and the only you know, you basically Roll a bunch of.

399
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:40,570
Scott: you don't have to roll dice You just go wherever you want to go for free.

400
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,959
Rym: because essentially what you do is you roll the dice move roll the dice Move roll the dice move and it doesn't matter.

401
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:50,177
Scott: Yeah You can just keep rolling forever and ever and ever and nothing can ever happen to you or change you can.

402
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:53,577
Scott: you can do That till the end of time until you have your little.

403
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:57,875
Scott: you know Your adventures in the exact squares you want them to be in.

404
00:28:58,256 --> 00:28:59,119
Rym: So what did we do?

405
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:02,370
Rym: We arranged ourselves seating wise in the optimal player order.

406
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:05,720
Rym: we would then arrange ourselves perfectly outside of each door.

407
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:20,181
Rym: I would then say I take 12 meaning I'm informing Alex that I'm going to sit here and roll 2d6 Continually until I roll a 12 and everyone is just going to stand still outside the door until they roll a 12.

408
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:26,142
Rym: Yes, and then once I and then basically I said we didn't have to actually roll it out because obviously it's going to happen at Some point.

409
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:26,464
Rym: Mm-hmm.

410
00:29:26,785 --> 00:29:29,840
Rym: So then we'd kick open the door rush in and kill everything.

411
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:37,423
Scott: Yeah basically Because we choose what order we go in we can kill all the monsters because you only have one hit point before they have a chance to even hit us.

412
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:43,846
Rym: occasionally a monster would survive long enough to hit at us once and it might not hit because we Collect all the equipment.

413
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:47,000
Scott: I mean then we would arrange ourselves in each and every room perfectly.

414
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:53,540
Scott: Search your treasure once to make sure there wasn't any default treasure and the worst that would happen is one monster would show up.

415
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:54,469
Scott: You'd immediately kill.

416
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:57,105
Rym: I Just wonder where that monster came from.

417
00:29:57,466 --> 00:29:58,711
Rym: We're in a tiny room.

418
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:00,156
Rym: It's completely empty.

419
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:01,420
Scott: He was he was like the predator.

420
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,210
Scott: He was invisible and then it ran out.

421
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,859
Scott: So then he's like, oh shit, and we got him.

422
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:12,465
Scott: You know That's where that monster came from and we would do this for each and every room in the game until we collected all the treasure And beat all the bad guys.

423
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:14,434
Scott: rinse and repeat the game is boring.

424
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:15,238
Scott: if you know what you're doing.

425
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:19,517
Rym: three treasure chests have been stolen while being taken to the Emperor.

426
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:26,660
Rym: a reward of 240 gold coins has been offered to any group of heroes who can return the chest and all of the goals.

427
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:42,059
Scott: You know, it would be much cooler if it was say two groups of two heroes competing to get the treasure or if it was Like you met other adventurers down there who are NPCs who you'd fight to get the treasure or something like that.

428
00:30:42,462 --> 00:30:45,220
Rym: Here's the thing one of the things that bothers me about the game.

429
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:48,039
Rym: I'm not gonna complain about the game because the game is made for little kids.

430
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,528
Rym: Yeah, but I remember there's Milton Bradley people.

431
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:56,980
Rym: now I am a reading ahead in the book Which if Alex ever wants to run the game for us, I just spoiled something.

432
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,194
Rym: But I'll note that I've played through all of your requests before.

433
00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:03,940
Rym: you don't remember it though But I remember this one and that's why I want to talk about it.

434
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:04,333
Rym: All right.

435
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,624
Rym: Now think about what I just said.

436
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:11,194
Rym: a reward of 240 gold coins has been offered any group of heroes who can return the chest and all the gold.

437
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:22,559
Rym: So I we go off to get the chest and if you beat this dungeon, you find that there are three chests each of which contains 250 gold coins, so why would you?

438
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,480
Rym: 750 gold plus a whole bunch of other items of value to the prince and Emperor.

439
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:29,350
Scott: So why would you give it back to the king?

440
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:29,853
Scott: Just keep it.

441
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:30,657
Rym: All right.

442
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:31,180
Rym: All right here.

443
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,627
Rym: I'll read the text under here.

444
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:33,472
Rym: There are three chests.

445
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:35,040
Rym: They are marked with the prince's royal symbol.

446
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:39,879
Rym: each chest is locked and contains 250 gold coins and other items of value to the prince and Emperor.

447
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,547
Rym: a Hero can carry only one chest at a time.

448
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:45,660
Rym: when carrying a chest the hero may only roll one red die for movement.

449
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:51,359
Rym: All right, the heroes cannot keep the gold inside the treasure chests, huh, why not?

450
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:58,320
Rym: The heroes cannot keep the gold inside the treasure chest period then why even specify how much is in there?

451
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,990
Scott: Why not make it some other McGuffin?

452
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:07,240
Rym: because they're sadists Because I remember when I was a kid and we we were kind of weak and my dad won.

453
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,740
Rym: My dad kind of cheated and he gave like all the monsters magic and he was just putting us.

454
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:15,340
Rym: Well, we ended up like getting the monsters in the chest room to chase us away.

455
00:32:15,722 --> 00:32:19,360
Rym: Then we ran back in and grabbed the chest and kind of bit by bit got the three chests out.

456
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:24,684
Rym: And then we had the dwarf pick the lock and we opened him and we were like, we're just not going back We're keeping the gold.

457
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:26,733
Rym: and my dad says you can't keep the gold.

458
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:28,300
Rym: and I said why not?

459
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,589
Rym: And I said you just can't keep.

460
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:35,037
Rym: and he said you can't keep the gold Yeah, and my brother and I raised holy living hell over there.

461
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:40,370
Rym: Oh, oh Rym what breaking news for Rym.

462
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,976
Rym: breaking news breaking news.

463
00:32:42,017 --> 00:32:42,398
Scott: You're ready.

464
00:32:42,518 --> 00:32:42,900
Rym: I'm ready.

465
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,238
Scott: Capcom classics minis mini mix screenshots.

466
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:55,320
Scott: on September 19th Capcom will release Capcom Capcom class classics mini mix for the GBA.

467
00:32:56,562 --> 00:33:09,531
Scott: the game re-releases the NES versions of Strider and mighty final fight and Bionic commando GBA cart for 1995 that is already purchased.

468
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:19,652
Scott: I September 19th 2006 look his screenshots look a good fucking guy.

469
00:33:19,672 --> 00:33:21,637
Scott: It's just an emulator of how to commando.

470
00:33:21,657 --> 00:33:25,809
Rym: I Hope they don't dumb down bionic commando.

471
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,438
Scott: It's it's the NES game just default.

472
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:29,160
Scott: It's an emulator.

473
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,440
Scott: You're basically buying, you know an NES emulator and a ROM on a GBA cartridge.

474
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,654
Rym: That game bionic is also mighty.

475
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:37,559
Scott: final fight in Strider.

476
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:39,584
Rym: Yeah, Strider was okay.

477
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:44,500
Rym: Yeah, but bionic commando is probably my second favorite Nintendo game ever.

478
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:46,425
Scott: All right here request.

479
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:49,033
Scott: but that was breaking news that could not be denied.

480
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:49,654
Scott: I just found it.

481
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:50,537
Rym: It is gaming day.

482
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:51,018
Rym: So it fits.

483
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,884
Scott: Yep Okay here.

484
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:53,446
Scott: Okay.

485
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,011
Scott: Not as good as bionic commando.

486
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:57,860
Rym: heroes cannot keep the gold inside the treasure chests.

487
00:33:58,262 --> 00:34:01,820
Scott: No, they can but bionic commando can steal your coins.

488
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:06,879
Rym: The other thing I find fascinating about this game is that the way it's set up.

489
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:10,639
Rym: there are a whole bunch of quests and The second quest is really easy.

490
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,818
Rym: The third quest is really easy and they get progressively more difficult as you go on but not unmanageably.

491
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:19,411
Scott: So yeah It's like the first quest is way harder than the second third fourth.

492
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:20,596
Rym: That's what I was gonna say.

493
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:21,719
Rym: Yeah, but you kind of ruined it.

494
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,368
Rym: I was gonna build it up and do something funny.

495
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,900
Rym: Oh, well, but instead you just came out with it.

496
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,748
Scott: Yeah, I just I just dumped right out there.

497
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:29,815
Rym: So I'm gonna pretend Scott didn't say that.

498
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:30,600
Rym: Okay now.

499
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:37,020
Rym: Then you go back and you realize that there's you know quest one because I said it starts at quest two and gets easier.

500
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:42,271
Rym: quest one is Harder than any other fucking quest in this whole game.

501
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:47,179
Rym: Oh my good God Do the monsters just rape you in the ass repeatedly?

502
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,320
Scott: Well, I think part of it is that in the first level you have no items and no equipment.

503
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:55,639
Rym: Also, there are more monsters than in like any other dungeon in the first one.

504
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,585
Scott: Yeah, because I think what they want to do is you know, the first time you're playing the game That's what you're gonna do.

505
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:07,559
Rym: So, you know, they want to make sure that it's a no They want to scare you because what one of these rooms probably the most bitching room in the game is.

506
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:09,023
Rym: I mean, there's.

507
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:12,680
Rym: there's a room with a tomb and a whole bunch of crap and there's stuff all over the place.

508
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:17,419
Rym: But and there's really really dangerous things to fight everywhere and the heroes are barely gonna survive.

509
00:35:18,462 --> 00:35:23,115
Rym: One room has two chaos warriors, which are pretty much the badasses of this game.

510
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:25,665
Rym: in that room It's a treasure chest.

511
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:27,958
Rym: in that treasure chest is bupkis.

512
00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:28,990
Rym: What?

513
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,878
Rym: bupkis, okay.

514
00:35:33,192 --> 00:35:35,404
Rym: Also There's an armory.

515
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:40,279
Rym: in the first dungeon you go into this armory and there's monsters defending it you kill them.

516
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:44,068
Rym: What would you think you would do if you just killed monsters?

517
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,760
Rym: and there's an obvious prop of a whole bunch of nice shiny weapons.

518
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:49,706
Scott: Take the shiny weapons.

519
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:53,620
Rym: the weapons on this weapons rack are chipped rusted and broken.

520
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,650
Rym: There is nothing here that the heroes would want.

521
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:57,660
Scott: they're better than my nothing.

522
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,305
Scott: I'm using nothing.

523
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:03,560
Rym: at the beginning of the you know, you had a serviceable short sword and I had a serviceable long.

524
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:05,014
Rym: So no, I didn't even have a long sword.

525
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:05,520
Rym: I had a broad.

526
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:11,340
Scott: So I would rather take a chipped and rusted bastard sword than a serviceable short sword.

527
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:14,999
Rym: Well, hey, at least you bought that stick and then immediately found a stick.

528
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:17,969
Scott: I know it's like I paid how many gold for a hundred.

529
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,862
Scott: I paid a hundred gold pieces, which is like God $10,000.

530
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:27,120
Scott: All right for a stick that I could have gotten in the woods for free.

531
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:32,235
Scott: And then I'm in a dungeon killing things with my stick and you know what?

532
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,298
Scott: I find a stick.

533
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:35,427
Scott: Yeah, okay.

534
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:36,214
Scott: There's a stick.

535
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:37,568
Scott: Oh great,

536
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:51,679
Rym: ooh I probably shouldn't look at this so much but and I just flipped through and I was gonna say that the nice thing about this Game that I thought was really cool, especially as a kid is that it gives you in the back a template Where you can make your own dungeons.

537
00:36:52,182 --> 00:37:00,211
Rym: They they urge you to photocopy these two pages and then cut and paste with you know Your little paste and scissors and make dungeons and continue playing the game.

538
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:00,873
Rym: Mm-hmm.

539
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:03,180
Rym: So the game is basically infinite playtime.

540
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:13,066
Rym: Yeah And I see here that Alex or someone in his family has at some point made in pencil a dungeon and the goblins look Really really happy really?

541
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:13,427
Scott: Let me see.

542
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:15,454
Rym: the goblins are cute little happy goblins.

543
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:17,320
Scott: Yeah, you'll have to give me the little paper.

544
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:19,351
Scott: Let me check the goblins out.

545
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:21,000
Scott: Oh happy goblin.

546
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:23,545
Scott: Yeah, I think Alex did this.

547
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,472
Rym: Yeah, I wonder if he even knows it's in there.

548
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:28,763
Rym: maybe Alex by the way is our Dungeon master.

549
00:37:28,864 --> 00:37:34,640
Rym: among other things he is one of our staunchest board game players and he's currently downstairs playing Final Fantasy legend, too.

550
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:37,580
Rym: He may or may not be listening to us while we record the show live.

551
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:39,999
Scott: Yeah, I don't know but he drew happy.

552
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:45,920
Rym: He did mention at one point that he feels like listening to GeekNights is redundant if you live with Rym and Scott.

553
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:50,380
Scott: Yeah, I guess that would be exactly true because this is what we say.

554
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:52,547
Rym: Yeah, you realize when we start recording.

555
00:37:52,848 --> 00:37:57,907
Rym: it's pretty much in the middle of a conversation just like this and when we stop recording we Continue this exact conversation.

556
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:01,623
Rym: Mm-hmm GeekNights could go almost 24/7.

557
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:03,779
Scott: Oh, well, there really aren't that many dungeons in this game.

558
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:15,263
Scott: No, no, oh wait, if you look at the size of dungeon one and just compare it to the sizes of the other dungeons Yeah, and the number of green guys and furniture is just way more In.

559
00:38:15,323 --> 00:38:22,280
Rym: just remember one hero quest is really fun in College to play a little bit with people who don't know what this game is about.

560
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:23,344
Scott: Hero quest is good.

561
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,960
Scott: If people don't know how to play the people are little kids or people are drunk.

562
00:38:27,687 --> 00:38:33,780
Rym: It's also really fun If you played it as a kid to play it again just enough to realize how much smarter you are now.

563
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,152
Scott: Oh, there's a castle of mystery.

564
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:35,878
Scott: That's pretty cool.

565
00:38:36,562 --> 00:38:42,522
Scott: Okay, so this game can get a little creative, but it still doesn't fix it entirely and I hate to say it But that's it.

566
00:38:42,683 --> 00:38:46,680
Rym: I would have read the flavor text from beating hero quest, but that's a spoiler.

567
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:52,020
Rym: It's so anti-climactic that I could not bring that pain upon you.

568
00:38:52,382 --> 00:39:05,583
Scott: Yeah, anyway in terms of meta bits The only thing I think is if you apply for membership to the forums Which you should if you're not already a member of the forums then you do not receive an email that says Congratulations.

569
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:07,048
Scott: You are now a member of the forums.

570
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:08,794
Scott: You got that email.

571
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:18,775
Scott: your spam filter just filtered it out especially if you're using hotmail, so If you apply to the forums just come back like a day later and just sign in and it'll work.

572
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:21,023
Rym: and of course the forums Are rocking.

573
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:26,460
Rym: as always the forums are practically an entire separate show at this point.

574
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,430
Scott: Yes, so go to front row crew.

575

Rym: Yeah I just realized here's the real flavor text which I won't read because it's an entire page.

00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:44,817
Rym: Okay, and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
