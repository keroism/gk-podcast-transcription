00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:26,818
Scott: Is there any other work left to do for IBM at all?

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,145
Rym: Uh, most of my only thing I think I've left to do is to sit there and answer questions for the next couple of days At work while people go.

7
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:34,727
Rym: Oh my god.

12
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:58,059
Scott: Yet with you have more work to do in the two days you have left that I have to do at all.

13
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:00,006
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

14
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,291
Rym: I don't have to do anything.

15
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:03,480
Rym: I'm not actually going to do anything.

16
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:08,456
Rym: I'm going to sit in my office and dick around on my computer and Answer any questions people have for the next two weeks.

00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:08,919
Rym: two days.

18
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,656
Scott: So you will be doing more than me in the next two days.

19
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:12,139
Scott: That's correct.

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,105
Rym: Possibly days three days.

21
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:15,993
Rym: I might say more words than you.

22
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:25,120
Scott: I might be saying the words TLDP Over and I'll definitely be saying very few words because I'll probably be alone in this middle of nowhere office.

23
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:31,668
Rym: You know if I'm alone in an office, I tend to talk to myself for saying I Yes, I don't do that I do.

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,419
Rym: I sit on the computer and I type Wow I just be on the phone talking to people all day.

25
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:39,427
Scott: You know, they got their free Skype by good.

26
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:47,216
Rym: Yeah, we got to start interviewing people start prank calling people something I used to prank call people all the time in high school when dial pad appeared.

27
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:50,448
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah dial pad when it appeared.

28
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:53,940
Rym: This was a long time ago and not many people had broadband.

29
00:01:54,782 --> 00:02:02,616
Rym: It was a website and you could go to this website and on the website call any real phone number for free and talk to It as though you had a phone.

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,531
Rym: It was used almost Exclusively for prank calls for a couple months and then it died.

31
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:12,869
Scott: and now we have Skype which can now do the same thing Until the end of the year, where are the prank calls?

32
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,852
Scott: What happened?

33
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:16,120
Rym: I don't know if prank calls happen so much anymore.

34
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:17,099
Rym: I think it's a dying art.

35
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:23,159
Scott: I'm gonna go onto the internet and find a website that tells me a bunch of funny prank calls I can do and then I'm.

36
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,328
Rym: I think the problem is punk kids today aren't as creative.

37
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:30,519
Rym: I mean the most recent prank call I remember is you kick my dog.

00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:33,127
Scott: Yeah, you kick my dog.

Rym: You come to my house you stand in my front yard and you kick my dog.

Rym: I made it my thing in the day.

52
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,635
Rym: There's a crazy thread in the forums.

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,718
Rym: I Would like to note that I went about trying to purchase the album.

54
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:32,272
Rym: two places I looked at it was sold out or not available and One of the places which seems to be a primary seller of their CDs Has an update talking about how the popularity of this album has exploded in the United States Due to an internet phenomenon bond some.

55
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:34,379

Rym: I find that just amazing and hilarious and great.

59
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:54,400
Scott: All I can say is this if you want to have a musical group and You want to start a band with your friends and you want your band?

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:02,600
Scott: To make a lot of money and get really popular What you do is some part of one of your songs has to be humorous or interesting or unique.

61
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:13,600
Scott: That's the hard part or very easily looped Yes Then take that part of one of your songs or one of your entire songs and make a viral internet flash with that song.

62
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,847
Scott: People will start wondering who did the music?

63
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:18,135
Scott: they'll find out that it's you and they'll all buy your album.

64
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:18,677
Rym: now.

65
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:26,820
Rym: bear in mind That a lot of people try to make things like this and if it's obvious that you tried to make it viral it'll fail.

66
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:35,667
Scott: Yeah There are a lot of freaking videos on the internet with a lot of freaking songs and only some of them Succeeds such as all your bass.

Rym: Yeah, the fake lesbians.

75
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:59,260
Rym: Yes, their music was meh, but because they were supposedly lesbians They were very popular partly because penny arcade they didn't even have to make a flash.

76
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,255
Scott: They just used their normal music video, which is hot lesbian action.

77
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,180
Rym: Yes, it was.

78
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:07,578
Rym: Unfortunately, the rest of their videos were not yeah unfortunately.

79
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,819
Scott: So If that's you know, that's the way to get popular I say go for it.

80
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,340
Scott: If especially if your music isn't that great you can still make a quick buck.

81
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:26,789
Rym: Yeah though I got to say I'm gonna probably get all of loich and was albums because I found some more of their songs other than Levins polka and I like their music a lot.

82
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,720
Rym: All right, I think I like rush.

83
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,243

84
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,718
Rym: so I think I'm gonna be the one who bites the bullet buys it all and then makes torrents.

85
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,107
Scott: Yep, so don't go buy these albums.

86
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,999
Scott: rimmel by them and then everyone else in the whole world will download them.

87
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:47,164
Rym: You know, what's scary?

88
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,734
Rym: There are like ten torrents on pirates Bay.

89
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:56,716
Rym: Well linked to on pirates Bay For Levins polka the song from spinny leak, but no other song by Lloyd.

90
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:57,519
Rym: too much is that one?

91
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,310
Scott: Because people don't care about the other songs.

92
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,336
Scott: They just want the one.

93
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:02,020
Scott: so they do.

94
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,434
Rym: That's why iTunes is kicking out, you know the snow You know how many threads out there are people saying why isn't loitering on iTunes?

95
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:09,257
Rym: I want their songs.

Rym: Oh my god.

97
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,379
Scott: Yeah, but as soon as someone buys one or two other Lloyd's in the songs They probably won't like them as much and they won't buy any more.

98
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:19,855
Rym: Yeah, people might be turned off by the fact that some of their music is instrumental.

99
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,643
Rym: Oh It's good though.

100
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:22,848

101
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,490

Scott: Yeah, I don't think there's any.

104
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:28,000
Rym: it's acapella.

105
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:30,755
Rym: Yeah, because there's the one guy who all he seems to do is go.

106
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,926
Rym: Hey boy Hey boy.

107
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,115

Rym: Dump.

114
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:46,899
Rym: Okay So in the video game news Well, actually in the podcast news Scott's breathing into the microphone really loudly.

115
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:52,406
Rym: but in video game news, I Actually did not notice this.

116
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:58,491
Rym: first one of my friends scooped me and then we both scooped Scott because he happened to be at Home with his parents and missed it.

117
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:05,000
Rym: on Sunday I was pointed out to me by a good friend Scott Johnson that there's a new Phoenix right game for the DS coming out.

118
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:05,584
Scott: Oh my god.

119
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,016
Scott: Oh my god gonna bite as soon as it comes out.

120
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:09,413
Rym: Oh my god It was on other sites before.

121
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:15,480
Rym: it was on kotaku Which is funny because kotaku is like the biggest that they like Phoenix right more than they should.

122
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:16,685
Scott: Oh they do.

123
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:17,971
Rym: indeed and it's hard to like.

124
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:19,377
Scott: the Phoenix right came out.

125
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:25,000
Scott: for months They were throwing Phoenix right references jokes and images into like an article per day.

126
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:28,690
Scott: Just go to kotaku and go find out when Phoenix right came out.

127
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:36,250
Scott: go to their page and you'll see there are disproportionate number of Articles about the game or referencing the game.

128
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:41,574
Rym: now the link I give has a bunch of screenshots Which they know exactly what we want to see.

129
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:45,727
Rym: because if you look through the screenshots They you'll notice things like.

130
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:53,828
Rym: you'll see some text whatever but then you realize who's saying the text and oh Yep, yep, yep a character.

131
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:57,299
Scott: I suggest you play the current Phoenix right before you play this one.

132
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:00,551
Rym: Yes, but I think the title of this game says it all.

133
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:05,135
Rym: the title of the game is Phoenix right ace attorney justice for all.

134
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:18,255
Scott: Yes, just you know the site that we're linking to is planet GameCube which They sometimes have reviews and stuff.

135
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:36,220
Scott: That's actually Content created by them, but mostly what they do is Take Nintendo press releases and third-party press releases and they go to the press websites where you can get you know The press images and all that stuff and they just paste it right up there as soon as it comes out.

136
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:38,812
Rym: I also hear that they have a lot of ads on their site.

137
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:40,440
Scott: they do but I blocked them all.

138
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,182
Rym: Yeah, me too.

139
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:43,129

Scott: Yeah, the site does look really nice.

00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,392
Scott: it looks like an iPod shuffle.

149
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:16,456

Scott: It's pretty powerful.

154
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:27,889
Scott: You know what?

155
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:36,720
Scott: 512 megs of RAM, but you can get up to two gigs if you want 60 gig hard drive, but you can get up to like a hundred and something if you want.

156
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,142
Rym: Oh get to.

157
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:38,548
Rym: the important part is black.

158
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,351
Scott: Okay.

159
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,219
Rym: No, you can get a black MacBook Pro.

160
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,263
Rym: now They're there.

161
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:48,731
Scott: Okay, your options are when buying a MacBook for a regular MacBook You have three options.

162
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:49,215
Scott: number one.

163
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:49,880
Scott: Do you get the shitty?

164
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,010
Scott: 1.83 gigahertz MacBook?

165
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:53,660
Scott: that's gonna be white no matter what.

166
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,565
Scott: Yeah shitty.

167
00:09:54,948 --> 00:10:02,150
Scott: if you get the two gigahertz MacBook Which is the one you should buy because the only one worth getting you have a choice between white and black.

168
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:08,329
Scott: However, if you get black the only limitation is that you your hard drive is gonna be at least 80 gigs.

169
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:12,583
Scott: You can get a white two gigahertz with a 60 your hard drive.

170
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:14,268
Rym: So they're definitely pulling this whole.

171
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:16,538
Rym: Yes The black ones are better.

172
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:18,950
Rym: So if you see someone with a black one, it's got more.

173
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:26,493
Scott: Well, someone could have a white one with more but if you have a black one, it meets the minimum Qual.

174
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:32,679
Rym: you know, it's like an old MMOs where if you had a black cowl or a black shirt It was like goddamn that guy's got black stuff.

175
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,492
Scott: Well, that was puzzle pirate specifically with no It was.

176
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:47,775
Rym: it was also very specific to the realm Okay, where black clothing was incredibly rare and expensive and if you got a hold of a vial of black dye or a black Baldrick it was like it would go for millions Mm-hmm.

177
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:56,646
Scott: Yeah So yeah If you carry around your black MacBook people will know that you're more badass and rich than the people with the white MacBooks.

178
00:10:57,047 --> 00:11:07,470
Scott: I Compared this thing to some other Laptops and it's actually a pretty good deal Especially since it comes with you know, the OS X and the I life in the front row.

179
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,143
Rym: And yeah, I mean these things are good laptops, but they're also the boot camp.

180
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,593
Rym: They're viable desktop replacements Mm-hmm.

181
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:14,879
Rym: I mean, they're that powerful.

182
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,170
Scott: You're not gonna be playing any awesome game.

183
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:27,650
Scott: Well, actually it's pretty wicked fast with the dual core, but the video card is an Intel's 950 graphics card with 64 megs of you know shared RAM.

184
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:30,118
Scott: So you're not gonna be playing.

185
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:38,406
Scott: you could probably play some normal games on it But don't expect to install windows of boot camp and then install DirectX and then play.

186
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:39,910
Scott: the awesome is new games.

187
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:46,112
Scott: You know, you could but you might not be able to play oblivion, but you could probably old oblivion And you could.

188
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:55,048
Scott: you probably might not have the greatest experience playing, you know, super half-life 2 But you could probably play counter-strike and half-life 1 very nicely.

189
00:11:55,068 --> 00:12:00,270
Rym: now I find it incredibly interesting that I saw this news reported all over the place.

190
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,669
Rym: I mean I saw it on the o'farrick and everywhere most people who talk about the new MacBook stuff.

191
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:10,333
Rym: The primary thing they said was black ones Like.

192
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:10,917
Rym: that's the news.

193
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:15,440
Rym: people reported not the specs not anything else Just the fact the fact that it has a camera in it.

194
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:16,383
Rym: No, no, they did.

195
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,030
Rym: Oh, it's black and that was the news.

196
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,548
Rym: Yeah, but no one cares about anything else.

197
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:24,539
Scott: Those are just Mac people who are pinned by Mac.

198
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,986
Rym: Yeah, but here's the thing my head right now.

199
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,390
Rym: I'm thinking ooh black.

200
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:33,153
Scott: well, see that's what they do is let's Think about this.

201
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:34,519
Rym: Nintendo does the same thing.

202
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,350
Rym: Look, of course game boy put out a boy with a color to it.

203
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,290
Scott: Yeah, what you do is you put out one product and you don't have a lot of variation.

204
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,710
Scott: So that way when you do have variation, it's a big deal.

205
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:51,660
Scott: If you just released a hundred colors at once people wouldn't go Red ooh green.

206
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:54,117
Scott: they'd be like I can get any color I want and they take it for granted.

207
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:04,466
Scott: if you put out only white ones Then all the people who want it for what it is right away get the white ones and then You put out red ones and people are like red.

208
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:09,310
Scott: Whoa And then people get red ones and then you then you make the special edition ones.

209
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,688
Scott: Yeah, then the colors have some sort of meaning to them like oh you got the the red one.

210
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:15,290
Scott: Holy crap.

211
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:23,233
Rym: Well, what we had a friend of ours up visiting and he already had a gameboy micro and he bought another one because it had A different skin.

212
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:26,202
Scott: Whoa, that's yeah, right.

213
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:27,205
Scott: I forgot about that.

214
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:28,970
Rym: Yeah, we made fun of him for about an hour.

215
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:30,776
Rym: Yeah, we're like, what are you doing?

216
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:32,262
Scott: Talk about throwing money away.

217
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:34,510
Rym: I was like, can I I'll buy your old one?

218
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:34,994
Rym: He's like.

219
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,688
Rym: no, I bought this so I can have two.

220
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:41,130
Scott: Yeah, yeah That's pissing money away.

221
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:44,010
Scott: No one should buy two macbooks to have a white one in a black one.

222
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:50,108
Scott: only buy a macbook if you need a laptop and the macbook suits your needs and The price is right for you.

223
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:56,450
Rym: My level of faith in humanity states currently that at least one person will buy one of each just for that purpose.

224
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,861
Scott: Probably yeah and buy whichever color you like.

225
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:02,248
Scott: better don't buy one because it's a certain color.

226
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:02,870
Scott: That's just stupid.

227
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,912
Scott: You're just an apples tool if you do that.

228
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:22,958
Rym: So things of the day Just remember you can go to frontroadcrew.com and the links to the things of the day will be right there because usually they're things We want to talk about but they're also things we want you to see.

229
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,830
Scott: Yeah, things of the day kind of need to be seen.

230
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:29,219
Scott: they can't just be talked about by us.

231
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:39,160
Scott: you know what the best is actually if you listen at a computer and We talk about the thing of the day while you look at it unless it's a spinny leak because then you'll be hypnotized.

232
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:47,590
Scott: Yeah hypnotism not so good when listening to a podcast Alright, so for people who know my political views.

233
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,637
Rym: I I really like Al Gore.

234
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:50,660
Rym: as a person.

235
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,548
Rym: I'm not gonna get into policy or anything.

236
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:56,980
Rym: We're not on my thing of the day while it involves all these things.

237
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,060
Rym: I'm not here to talk about politics.

238
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:03,956
Rym: I'm not here to argue either way on environmentalism or global warming or anything.

239
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:04,980
Scott: goddamn dirty hippies.

240
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:13,654
Rym: All I want to say is that this is probably the most fear-mongering Movie trailer I've ever seen in my life.

241
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:14,600
Scott: I agree.

242
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:20,101
Rym: I mean, this is beyond the the spin of Fahrenheit 9/11.

243
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:21,807
Rym: This is like I'd say it's pretty equal.

244
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,255
Rym: The trailer is like you will all die.

245
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,540
Rym: You are all going to die.

246
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:26,786
Rym: Everyone is going to die.

247
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:27,389
Rym: Oh my god.

248
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:27,792
Rym: Oh my god.

249
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:28,254
Rym: Oh my god.

250
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,078
Rym: We're all going to die.

251
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:29,440
Rym: Oh my god.

252
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,514
Scott: Oh my god I think Al Gore is at this point is just saying let's fight fire with fire.

253
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:39,960
Rym: if they're gonna fear monger terrorists We're gonna fear monger global warming which I really think that's true because Al Gore is a smart, dude.

254
00:15:40,564 --> 00:16:00,503
Rym: I don't know exactly what Al Gore's deal is but after the 2000 election he you know, he grew a beard and he was kind of quiet for a while and Then he kind of took off his mask of unoffensive unassuming liberal Democrat guy who never wanted to say anything that can anger anyone ever and he turned into Fire brand.

255
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:01,466
Rym: Oh my god.

256
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:02,409
Rym: This is the situation.

257
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:05,800
Rym: This country's in horrible environmental environmentalism blah.

258
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,471
Rym: And he's given some awesome speeches.

259
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:12,725
Rym: I mean in this trailer There's a funny bit where he introduces himself is like hi.

260
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:13,406
Rym: I'm Al Gore.

261
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:18,824
Rym: I used to be the next president of the United States haha Pined.

262
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:20,560
Rym: but watch this movie trailer.

263
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:24,873
Rym: I defy you to find anything more fear mongering than that.

264
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:27,000
Rym: that is also a trailer for a major motion picture.

265
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:28,864
Scott: Any disaster movie?

266
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:34,617
Rym: Yeah, but those don't monger fear those monger the liking or enjoying or watching a fear.

267
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:39,110
Rym: Oh Okay, this movie is like you're going to die not what?

268
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,180
Rym: if something happened and we all died in this independence day?

269
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,972
Rym: That was more root aliens root aliens.

270
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:47,478
Rym: Let's drag your ass through the desert.

271
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:52,463
Rym: That glass bulletproof Yes, sir.

272
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:54,489
Scott: Oh, no, sir way to ruin it.

273
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:55,792
Scott: Yeah, I messed it up.

274
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:58,379
Rym: Yeah, I like Independence Day, even though it's stupid.

275
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:02,919
Scott: Well Smith is just so funny when he drags the aliens through the desert.

276
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:08,472
Rym: It is the best all right, so you got a thing of the day right I sure do?

277
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,319
Scott: everyone knows about dance dance revolution?

278
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,490
Scott: Oh, yeah, do you know about?

279
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,289
Rym: Step mania step mania everyone knows about.

280
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:21,944
Scott: I think step mania is DDR for the computer But it's free.

281
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,308
Rym: You can make your own songs.

282
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:26,959
Rym: You can get illegal versions of all the songs from DDR.

283
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:29,429
Rym: I don't know where you can actually get these songs.

284
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:37,908
Rym: DDR Brazil Brazil DDR Brazil but Spain huh, I don't actually remember.

285
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,212
Rym: okay doesn't matter.

286
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,478
Rym: anyone who has step mania knows where to get it.

287
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:42,080
Scott: That's for sure.

288
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:49,699
Scott: So yeah, it's basically DDR for your computer, which you can turn into a real DDR machine without paying Konami any money.

289
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:59,300
Scott: so Red octane who makes in the groove and the DDR pads and guitar hero and all that stuff go guitar hero.

290
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:00,598
Scott: They make it our hero.

291
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,550
Scott: Someone said hey if we could make step mania.

292
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:07,679
Scott: Why don't we make free tar hero?

293
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:11,549
Scott: and This guy Anton streak.

294
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:18,133
Scott: I guess is his name because that's his domain name Has made a program called free tar hero.

295
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:30,119
Scott: It's not actually out yet It's gonna be actually two programs also one program is the song editor Which you take an mp3 or any other song and you make the notes to it?

296
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:38,400
Scott: and The other piece of software is the game that will allow you to play the things you make in the editor.

297
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:44,857
Scott: so Right now the only thing on this site is a video of how the editor works.

298
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:49,395
Scott: and I have to say Compared to all the things that let you edit DDR arrows.

299
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:50,740
Scott: This is incredible.

300
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,932
Rym: The video will get you really excited about this game.

301
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,700
Rym: Yeah, I am excited.

302
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:57,626
Rym: I want to make songs.

303
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:08,160
Scott: see now what this does for me is I was thinking maybe I'll buy a Ps2 to get the guitar hero and some racing games, you know, but now I'm thinking hey screw that shit.

304
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:16,179
Scott: I'll get free tar hero a guitar from red octane for the PC and then I'll get a 360 and we and we'll be set All right.

305
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:25,911
Rym: Yeah The best part about this video is the selection of songs they use to show the capabilities of the editor is Perhaps the perfect collection of songs to showcase how awesome this game could be.

306
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:28,620
Scott: It's not 100% perfect, but it's a damn good selection.

307
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,112
Rym: Yeah, I don't think it could be a hundred percent perfect.

308
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:32,679
Rym: How long would it have to be?

309
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:35,826
Scott: But there was no Led Zeppelin.

310
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:38,213
Scott: adding one Led Zeppelin song would have improved it greatly.

311
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:38,695
Scott: Yeah.

312
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,260
Scott: Yeah, probably but that's it.

313
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,623
Scott: Yeah, free tar hero.

314
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:42,426
Scott: Look forward to it.

315
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:43,609
Scott: free guitar hero.

316
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,311
Scott: Awesome.

317
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:46,476
Rym: So continuing with worst week.

318
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:52,740
Scott: It is video game day So we're not gonna talk about the worst video games because we'll be here forever.

319
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:55,131
Scott: ET custard's ready to custard's revenge.

320
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:56,256
Scott: ET custard's revenge.

321
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:00,077
Rym: custard's revenge Gameplay wise was significantly better than ET.

322
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:05,760
Scott: the extraterrestrial ET was a bad game, but it was not a hundred percent bad.

323
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,789
Scott: It was ninety nine point nine percent customers.

324
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:08,833
Rym: revenge had some gameplay.

325
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:09,818
Rym: You had to dodge those answers.

326
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:09,998
Scott: avenge.

327
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:13,538
Scott: It might as well be a hundred percent bad.

328
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,409
Scott: No, it was about raping a Native American woman.

329
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:19,540
Scott: Oh giant breasts and she's all pixelated Atari stuff.

330
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,263
Rym: But here's the thing.

331
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:22,472
Scott: All right, it doesn't get right than that.

332
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:22,934
Scott: So you got.

333
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:27,550
Scott: you're saying that a te Telefono la casa is worse now.

334
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:28,854
Rym: They gotta hear me anything.

335
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:34,052
Scott: women with a naked Custer there's dodging arrows.

336
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:34,434
Rym: Now.

337
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:35,278
Rym: You got to hear me out here.

338
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:38,287
Rym: Custer's revenge is not that bad a game.

339
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:51,111
Rym: in the same way that from a pure ideological standpoint I agree with some of what the South was doing in the Civil War Because if the Civil War is just about states rights woo go south.

340
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:54,140
Rym: The problem was the Civil War was also about slavery.

341
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:57,243
Rym: so boo South Custer's revenge.

342
00:20:57,303 --> 00:21:01,920
Rym: the game is a typical semi crappy Atari game, but it's not the bottom of the barrel.

343
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:07,871
Rym: However, it is skinned with probably the most offensive thing that has ever been put in a video game ever.

344
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:17,488
Rym: Oh Rendition I'll make the text adventure.

345
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:18,495
Rym: you get on that 3d one.

346
00:21:18,515 --> 00:21:21,222
Rym: All right You know what.

347
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:24,515
Rym: if we did that we would probably get a whole bunch of traffic to the site.

348
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:32,486
Scott: We probably would All right, I think I'd put it on my site not the GeekNights say yeah But we definitely had to say something about.

349
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:32,646
Rym: this.

350
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:33,852
Rym: is a front row crew production.

351
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:35,117
Scott: Yeah, we would we don't.

352
00:21:35,157 --> 00:21:37,476
Scott: we don't even say This is a front row crew production when it is.

353
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:41,531
Rym: So we decided to not talk about video games.

354
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:44,640
Rym: we're just talking about consoles and hardware.

355
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,524
Rym: Otherwise, we'd be here all night.

356
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:48,106
Rym: Yep.

357
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:48,968
Rym: Now.

358
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:54,446
Rym: I got a long list in no particular order chronological order semi Chronological order.

359
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:57,518
Rym: I kinda was real fast and loose with that All right.

360
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:00,289
Rym: And also I might just forget or skip around.

361
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:03,380
Rym: and I'd like to note again that we're trying to be somewhat objective here.

362
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,572
Rym: We're not talking about things that we dislike.

363
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:05,954
Scott: Yes.

364
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:10,529
Scott: This is worst week Not Rym and Scott heat week because it was Rym and Scott heat week.

365
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,036
Scott: We would probably talk about Sony.

366
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:17,183
Rym: Yeah Sony Yeah Yeah, like.

367
00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:18,488
Scott: but it's not heat week.

368
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,573
Scott: It's worst week.

369
00:22:19,814 --> 00:22:25,472
Scott: So it's not things we hate It's things that are terrible because everyone they're basically useless.

370
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:31,194
Rym: like the best example here just to show the difference here Is that the game gear which is one thing we're going to talk about.

371
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,560
Rym: I love the game gear.

372
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:34,045
Rym: I own a game gear.

373
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:39,499
Rym: I if I could find the game gear that I own would probably still play it occasionally But it's terrible.

374
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:42,000
Rym: It was an awesome piece of technology.

375
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,660
Rym: That was still a miserable failure and thus deserves to be on the worst list is a better example.

376
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:53,120
Scott: I really don't like Chrysler Sebring convertibles because I just don't like them but it's a car.

377
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:54,876
Rym: What did one like hit you when you were a kid?

378
00:22:54,998 --> 00:23:02,580
Scott: I don't know I just don't like them but It seems like a car that pretends to be a sports fast car when really is just a normal shitty car like a Landry.

379
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:06,038
Scott: That isn't an evolution kind of but at least those look cool.

380
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:10,918
Scott: But the Ford Pinto is a piece of shit.

381
00:23:11,743 --> 00:23:12,466
Scott: Everyone knows it.

382
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:14,516
Scott: There's no there's no butts about it.

383
00:23:14,597 --> 00:23:15,260
Scott: It's just terrible.

384
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:18,755
Scott: So a Ford Pinto will make it into worst week.

385
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,506
Rym: It was a Plymouth Horizon Exactly.

386
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:28,100
Scott: It's not a joy to ride But the Sebring will only make it into Rimm and Scott hate week and not worst week.

387
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:35,360
Rym: So we're going to start with probably one of the most infamous old-school failures at video gaming the Philips CDI.

388
00:23:36,121 --> 00:23:38,333
Scott: Oh, man, that thing was just terrific.

389
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:43,552
Scott: I want one so bad It had so many great games and this interesting roller controller.

390
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:44,455
Scott: Oh, it was fit.

391
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:44,997
Scott: Oh, man.

392
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:46,020
Scott: Why is that in worst week?

393
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,060
Rym: Yeah, I mean it had that connect for game and all those Zelda games.

394
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:56,540
Scott: Oh, yeah Those all the games that were things of the day a while ago the videos on YouTube of the openings and endings that were hilarious.

395
00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:11,140
Scott: Yeah, the Philips CDI came out of a long complicated clusterfuck between Nintendo Sony and Phillips When they were trying to make CD-ROM attachments for the SNES and they came up with a standard called the CDI standard.

396
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:19,299
Scott: Yes, they never had never really worked out Right and what ended up happening was Phillips just busted out on their own and came out with the CDI.

397
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:29,060
Rym: Yeah But they had an agreement because of this whole clusterfuck with Nintendo To be able to use Nintendo characters and Nintendo franchises in their games for a little while.

398
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:33,080
Rym: So Nintendo was contractually obligated to let them make these horrible Zelda games.

399
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:40,859
Rym: Luckily the thing was an abysmal failure because no one in their right mind would buy it.

400
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:42,344
Rym: It was very expensive.

401
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:43,769
Rym: It had terrible games.

402
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,899
Rym: The first games that came out for were just board games that you played on your TV.

403
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:59,000
Scott: Yeah, according to that we have this handy chart here that came out recently showing adjusted for inflation the Costs of every important console at release in the u.s.

404
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,565
Rym: We'll be referring to this a lot today.

405
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:03,575
Scott: the CDI cost the equivalent of $400 when it came out.

406
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:06,725
Rym: Yeah, $400.

407
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:07,768
Rym: That's an Xbox 360.

408
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:11,760
Rym: It sure is the CDI was just shit.

409
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,529
Scott: That's the best Xbox 360.

410
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:15,480
Rym: It had terrible load times.

411
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:21,440
Rym: The games were crap the the system barely worked at lots of problems making them function and they broke down all the time.

412
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,690
Rym: They were a complete failure on the market.

413
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,713
Rym: Phillips tried to re-engineer them to sell them as like business kiosks and stuff and that failed.

414
00:25:29,114 --> 00:25:32,903
Rym: and the whole abysmal failure was Discontinued and forgotten.

415
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:41,927
Scott: It was supposed to be all cool because CDs are big in those days and everyone just wanted CDs CDs But it didn't actually get you anything.

416
00:25:41,987 --> 00:25:42,449
Scott: It just sucked.

417
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:45,179
Rym: Yeah laser discs were more popular than the Phillips CDI.

418
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:47,079
Rym: That says a lot.

419
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:50,329
Scott: So CDI one of the worst consoles ever.

420
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:54,000
Rym: now that was a case of bad technology for a high price.

421
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:56,640
Rym: There's really no redeeming factor not one.

422
00:25:56,901 --> 00:26:09,940
Scott: I can't think of a single reason anyone would want a Phillips CDI unless By some miracle there was actually maybe one or two good games using the roller controller Which is the giant yellow yellow ball that you would spin around.

423
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:12,392
Rym: Now we could go on to another.

424
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:13,920
Rym: here's a whole different list of worse.

425
00:26:14,321 --> 00:26:23,599
Rym: These are all lumped together because they all failed for the same reason the game gear the Lynx the turbo graphics Portable what was that called?

426
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,895
Rym: I forget I don't remember the Sega Nomad.

427
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:33,660
Scott: Yeah Well, the Sega Nomad slightly different than the others, but in general they all have the same problem.

428
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,060
Scott: There are portable systems that weren't very portable.

429
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:39,140
Rym: They were incredibly badass in terms of technology.

430
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:45,080
Rym: The game gear is similar in size to the PSP only about three times thicker and heavier.

431
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:51,240
Rym: Yeah, but back in the day when it came out I mean the Game Boy had that lime green screen that you couldn't see for shit.

432
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:52,243
Rym: It was a crap.

433
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:52,865
Rym: Oh system.

434
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:56,054
Rym: The game gear was a full-color backlit LCD.

435
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:58,020
Scott: You could get a TV tuner for it.

436
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,330
Scott: It took four double-a batteries and it drained right away it.

437
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:03,176
Rym: No, it took six double-a batteries.

438
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:04,319
Scott: All right six nevermind.

439
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:13,449
Rym: Sorry It lasted about three hours on those batteries Mmm, but I mean the system was hot too.

440
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:20,412
Rym: Yeah, it was but the system was extremely powerful Extremely badass and it wasn't that expensive.

441
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:22,580
Rym: It was very expensive, but it could have been worse.

442
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,120
Scott: It was cheap enough for a lot of people actually had game gears.

443
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:35,534
Scott: The problem was is that the games released for the game gear weren't portable style games Thing with the turbo graphics 16 portable it was.

444
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:37,040
Scott: they weren't portable games.

445
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,980
Scott: They were console games games that were designed to be played on your TV sitting on the couch.

446
00:27:43,522 --> 00:27:46,375
Scott: Only they let you take them around with you and that doesn't work too.

447
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:50,698
Rym: Well, yep Well, it was basically a portable console as opposed to a portable.

448
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:57,719
Rym: Yep I mean I use my game gear only in the car where I knew I wouldn't be interrupted because if I started playing a game It was basically a Sega game.

449
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:01,679
Rym: I had to play my whole thing and I couldn't save my game or anything for quite some time.

450
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:05,911
Rym: I remember having races between my battery and finding a save point.

451
00:28:06,473 --> 00:28:10,374
Scott: if you notice the game boy the original game boy Which didn't suck at all?

452
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,300
Rym: Well, it's like it kind of sucked technologically technologically speaking.

453
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:27,980
Scott: but the reason that the games didn't suck and the reason the game boy won in the end is because of the kind of games it had were games like Kirby's pinball which you could just play and then turn off Yoshi to play and turn off Tetris play and turn off.

454
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:29,146
Rym: I mean consider this the.

455
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:34,640
Rym: the original game boy is one of the highest selling video game things ever.

456
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:49,969
Scott: If you take the game boy the game boy pocket the game boy color and the game boy advance Which are all really the game boy Just you know I mean the game boy advance really isn't any different than the game boy and the game boy color Any more than the DS light is different from the DS.

457
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,133
Scott: It's just plus plus.

458
00:28:51,515 --> 00:28:52,899
Scott: They're really all the same platform.

459
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:57,538
Scott: The game boy is the number one video game in the world period.

460
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,124
Rym: I mean The original game boy.

461
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:09,740
Rym: probably outsold the game gear the links the turbo graphics thing and all those other Things that came out combined by by an order of magnitude at least and the game boy pocket sold insane.

462
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:13,351
Scott: I think everyone replaced their game boys the game boy pockets.

463
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:16,060
Scott: I actually was still playing their game boys.

464
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:19,299
Rym: I didn't because I had my game gear and I had those eight games.

465
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:23,380
Scott: And then when the game boy color came out a lot of people bought that but not so many.

466
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:27,436
Scott: But then when the game boy advance came out that sold more than the original.

467
00:29:27,456 --> 00:29:28,540
Scott: that sold more than anything.

468
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:35,280
Rym: Now the Lynx was worse than the game gear in that it was more powerful and better and cost more.

469
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:37,630
Scott: It also came out earlier.

470
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,156
Rym: I mean the game it came with.

471
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:40,000
Rym: it was blue something.

472
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:45,520
Scott: It was this like flight sim fighting game that I remember the TV commercial that showed a kid in the school bathroom playing it.

473
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,633
Scott: Wasn't that the TV commercial?

474
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:48,244
Rym: I Brings a bell.

475
00:29:48,304 --> 00:29:49,127
Scott: That's what I remember.

476
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:49,609
Scott: You're flying.

477
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:52,399
Scott: it might not be right, but I remember the flight sim game.

478
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:53,819
Scott: So that's definitely real.

479
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:57,848
Rym: I played a Lynx and it was pretty badass But the thing was hellishly expensive.

480
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:00,700
Rym: the games were few and far between and it just disappeared off the shelves.

481
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:08,430
Scott: Yeah, I remember seeing TV commercials for the Lynx and I think I saw it in a Toys R Us once But I never knew anyone who had one.

482
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,237
Scott: I never knew anyone who played one.

483
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:16,920
Scott: I And it disappeared and the commercials went away and that was that I mean at least the game flash in the pen.

484
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:20,357
Rym: The game gear was marketed heavily and it was fairly popular.

485
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:27,260
Rym: it If you at least if you look at it the game gear is very similar in terms of the sales and demographics to the PSP.

486
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:29,406
Scott: Yeah, it was set.

487
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:36,200
Scott: it sold second most when compared to the game boy But it had a lot of fancy fancy awesome game and it did sell quite a bit.

488
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,186
Rym: I mean the game gear did very well early on.

489
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:42,438
Scott: a lot of people have game gears, but it just died out.

490
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:43,120
Scott: It couldn't maintain.

491
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:45,548
Rym: And we're not.

492
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:52,620
Rym: I'm not really ragging on the PSP I'm just saying that there's a trend that that type of system does not die completely.

493
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,640
Scott: But it will be is definitely on a level above these things so far.

494
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,040
Scott: Who knows maybe ten years from now the PSP will be in worst week.

495
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,187
Scott: Maybe not but right now it's not.

496
00:31:02,347 --> 00:31:06,540
Scott: but game gear is and the PSP looks to be the same thing.

497
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,700
Rym: It is my my opinion my belief that the PSP is going to fall the same way that the aimed ear gear did.

498
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:16,959
Rym: It's not a Lynx It's not a total failure because there are games for it and people seem to like it.

499
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:19,829
Rym: But there were games for the game gear and people seem to like it.

500
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:22,117
Rym: This console itself was just not a sustainable market.

501
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,707
Rym: Yep Now back to well, we didn't even met.

502
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:29,240
Rym: we'd said the Sega Nomad that was like the worst offender in terms of games.

503
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,439
Rym: Well, it's just it just played Sega games.

504
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,725
Scott: Well, the Sega Nomad.

505
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:36,240
Scott: what they tried to do is that the Genesis was kind of flailing.

506
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:39,380
Scott: So they came out the Sega Nomad, which is a portable Sega Genesis.

507
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:42,069
Scott: What do you do to take Sega Genesis games?

508
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,021
Scott: you stick it into the Nomad and you can play them in your car Point.

509
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,884
Rym: the first Sega Genesis games are big.

510
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:59,353
Scott: Yeah, this thing the Genesis games would stick out of it big-time - it was real big and heavy and black and Three as I was talking before about portable games.

511
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:01,080
Scott: Well now you're taking it a step further.

512
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,440
Scott: You're playing the console games themselves with you wherever you go.

513
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,600
Rym: Those games are not conducive to popping off a five-minute game and stopping not at all.

514
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:14,952
Scott: And considering you even lost the two-player of any you know any hope?

515
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:17,600
Rym: yep, and that thing ate batteries like a motherfucker.

516
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:21,074
Rym: Yeah, it ate the batteries the game gears the worst offender there.

517
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:22,479
Scott: Not too many people bought it.

518
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:29,965
Rym: I think it's slightly boosted the Genesis and then it disappeared though a little trick if anyone still has a game gear You know, it takes six batteries.

519
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:39,020
Rym: I'll find a link to a picture or something, but two of those batteries Power, it's one or two of them power the backlight and the rest of them power the system.

520
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:42,580
Rym: Yep, those two batteries died long before everything else.

521
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,554
Rym: So if you rotated your batteries around you could get a lot more life out of them.

522
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:53,237
Scott: or you could buy two Wicked awesome batteries and put them in those holes and then use normal shit batteries in the rest of the holes.

523
00:32:53,457 --> 00:32:59,120
Rym: or I saw some People at jury-rigged little extenders where they put three batteries there for a total of seven batteries.

524
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:00,868
Rym: Mmm, that seemed to do the trick.

525
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:03,480
Scott: my friend hit is he bought these third-party grips.

526
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,673
Scott: They were actually little black things that you stuck.

527
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:19,080
Scott: They were like battery packs, but And grips and you stuck them into the battery slots and you plugged it into the wall and it charged up the battery packs And it would last a bit longer than just normal batteries.

528
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,579
Rym: I had this big black thing that would hang from the bottom and it looked like a telephone receiver, but it did the same thing.

529
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:29,864
Scott: Yeah, it's just what you need on an already humongous black system is yeah that thing weighed over a pound with all the batteries on It.

530
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:41,556
Scott: yeah I mean the original Gameboy was huge and it wasn't until the Gameboy Pocket where they made the screen bigger and it only used Two triple-a batteries or three triple-a batteries.

531
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:42,460
Scott: It was it was real.

532
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:44,030
Scott: It was a huge improvement.

533
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:50,460
Scott: if you want to talk about improvements You think the SP was so much better than the GBA or the DS light is so much better than the DS.

534
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,071
Scott: Compare the Gameboy Pocket to the Gameboy.

535
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:55,100
Scott: Yeah, that's the biggest leap ever.

536
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:55,943
Rym: I mean it.

537
00:33:56,505 --> 00:34:00,340
Rym: I didn't realize it till I went to the Nintendo store and saw an original Gameboy again.

538
00:34:00,802 --> 00:34:05,020
Rym: Those things were huge and clunky and that screen was really really really tiny.

539
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:14,386
Scott: Yeah, and my brother had was like he got a Gameboy Pocket and Pokemon when it came out when the Gameboy was revived for in The Pokemon days got.

540
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:15,469
Scott: that thing is thin.

541
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:16,713
Scott: It's small.

542
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,639
Scott: The screen is big and awesome.

543
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:23,391
Scott: It takes very few batteries triple-a batteries and it lasts forever.

544
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:26,600
Scott: and it plays all original Gameboy games.

545
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,639
Rym: Yeah, God, I remember I had this big magnifying glass light thing that I'd stick on my Gameboy.

546
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:33,715
Scott: Oh, yeah, people had those things.

547
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:34,420
Scott: Yeah, they were funny.

548
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,643
Rym: I'd one for the game here too.

549
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:37,632
Rym: that just made it badass, but it was heavy.

550
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:39,980
Scott: So yeah, it's already heavy.

551
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,547
Scott: So why not throw some more shit on there?

552
00:34:41,768 --> 00:34:43,820
Rym: now, you notice we didn't love the engage in with all this.

553
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,138
Rym: We're gonna talk about that later that that failed for a completely different set of reasons.

554
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:53,159
Rym: Awesome Now we got the 3do to move away from portables for a bit.

555
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:55,940
Scott: Okay Let's talk about the 3do cuz it's a special case.

556
00:34:56,201 --> 00:35:06,540
Scott: First of all, according to the chart that I mentioned earlier that says the real prices of consoles The 3do is the most expensive console ever at the equivalent of seven hundred dollars.

557
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:10,881
Rym: It's slightly more expensive than the current PlayStation 3 adjusted for inflation Yep.

558
00:35:11,363 --> 00:35:14,612
Scott: Now the thing with the 3do is it wasn't just one console.

559
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:17,200
Scott: What it was is a standard for consoles.

560
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:27,000
Scott: so if you wanted to and You were an electronics company You could make a 3do console as long as it met the following standards and had the following chips and all that.

561
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:33,800
Scott: So, I think there was like a 3do 3do and a Panasonic 3do and you could choose which 3do you wanted.

562
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,763
Scott: So you had different people competing to see who could make the best 3do console, but they all played any 3do game Just fine.

563
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,540
Rym: It was crazy powerful and awesome.

564
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:49,066
Scott: It was wicked powerful and there were some crazy games for it that no one remembers But one of them was start.

565
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:51,658
Scott: There was a star control version of star control 2 for the 3do.

566
00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:59,380
Rym: I mean this is back when Arcades were popular partly because the games in the arcades were so amazing looking compared to games at home.

567
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:03,797
Scott: Yeah, if you went to the arcade and played Ninja Turtles 2, that was the shit.

568
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:13,509
Scott: But then if you played Ninja Turtles 2 arcade version for the NES, it was the same game, but it didn't compare at all Yep, and there were a lot of reasons for that.

569
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,320
Rym: The 3do was like having an arcade in your house.

570
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:18,891
Scott: The Neo Geo was like having an arcade.

571
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:24,580
Scott: Yeah, that was the point of the Neo Geo Which I'll talk about but the 3do is just Wow.

572
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:29,960
Rym: Now the problem was it was so expensive that no one bought it and there weren't any game.

573
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,338
Scott: I can't even remember a goddamn game for it besides star control 2 and I don't remember it because it was a 3do game.

574
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,054
Scott: I remember it because it's star control fucking 2.

575
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:41,537
Rym: Yeah, there was a kid I knew who lied all the time about how he had a 3do but we knew he didn't.

576
00:36:41,557 --> 00:36:47,898
Scott: I Remember it because I subscribed to game pro from when I was in middle school up until just recently and I'm trying.

577
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,971
Scott: I'm gonna sell The magazines on eBay at some point.

578
00:36:50,132 --> 00:36:58,924
Scott: Yeah, if anyone's interested Yeah, if you want like 10 or 11 years worth of game pro magazines from 95 through the present I subscribe before 95.

579
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:00,900
Scott: But in those days, they didn't have flat bindings.

580
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,756
Scott: So those magazines died and got thrown out.

581
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:08,781
Rym: My me and my brother have a. we share a copy of every Nintendo power from 1 until like 300.

582
00:37:08,781 --> 00:37:12,155
Scott: My brother has Nintendo power, I think from like 96 to 2,000 or something like that.

583
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,938
Rym: I have the original covers that were banned because they were scary to little kids.

584
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:26,947
Scott: Yep Anyway, I remember seeing all these consoles in the game pro magazines the 3do and all this shit, but Never made it anywhere.

585
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:28,635
Rym: Yeah, they had failed.

586
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:29,680
Rym: simply the technology.

587
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:35,100
Rym: Well, the technology was good as technology tends to be it was just so expensive and unwieldy that no it couldn't happen.

588
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:36,310
Rym: It was a miserable failure.

589
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:36,935
Rym: It's one of the worst.

590
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:39,856
Rym: Yep Now here's a pisser.

591
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:41,664
Rym: Remember the virtual boy.

592
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:42,507
Rym: Oh god.

593
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:46,840
Scott: That's the only time I think Nintendo put out a console that just bombed.

594
00:37:47,303 --> 00:37:48,513
Rym: It was like the gameboy.

595
00:37:48,553 --> 00:38:02,394
Rym: color wasn't the best It wasn't a big winner But it wasn't a complete blowout like the bird now boy when the early rumors came about the virtual boy Originally was like it's gonna be a full color VR thing because back then VR was big.

596
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:10,840
Scott: Yeah, you gotta realize that You know before the days of 3d graphics and all that people were looking for virtual reality.

597
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,680
Scott: That was the next big thing was goggles and motion sensors power glove the activator which we'll talk about later.

598
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,506
Scott: Yep, I mean VR was like a lot of stuff later.

599
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:21,758
Rym: Yeah, remember that show VR five your VR troopers.

600
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:22,380
Rym: God.

601
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:25,035
Rym: Yeah, VR was the buzzword back then.

602
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:25,920
Rym: it was the thing.

603
00:38:26,302 --> 00:38:35,097
Rym: So Nintendo was gonna capitalize on that and make this full color immersive Virtual reality console and they wouldn't correct their mistake until 2006 with the Wii.

604
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:45,199
Rym: Yeah, so then as time went on Nintendo seemed to realize that alright We can't make this color because then maybe one person could afford it.

605
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,428
Rym: Yep, so they made it red and black.

606
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:57,300
Scott: I remember I played a virtual boy in the store Toys R Us of course in those days and I played Mario Tennis.

607
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,127
Scott: It was I think that was the first Mario Tennis.

608
00:38:59,508 --> 00:39:01,355
Rym: It might have been I think it was cuz.

609
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:08,719
Scott: this was an old console it was and It was just a pain in the ass to play and the depth really fucked with my head.

610
00:39:08,961 --> 00:39:09,483
Rym: See, I like.

611
00:39:09,604 --> 00:39:12,739
Rym: I liked playing it like it was really fun and it looked really cool.

612
00:39:13,202 --> 00:39:16,140
Rym: But after about ten minutes my eyes would hurt and I get a headache.

613
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:19,360
Scott: The problem was you had to like lean over to get your head into it.

614
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,060
Scott: It was not comfortable to get to any sitting position.

615
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,241
Rym: It was this big red goggly thing that was heavy and plastic and you had to put it on a tripod and then lean into It.

616
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:28,306
Rym: you couldn't wear it.

617
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,500
Scott: the leaning into it was what hurt your back in your neck.

618
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,312
Rym: The controller was actually kind of good.

619
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:37,600
Scott: the controller I think was the first one to have the grips.

620
00:39:38,102 --> 00:39:49,720
Scott: Like, you know today the GameCube controller the PlayStation control the Xbox controller they all have a piece of plastic that just comes down on the left and the right that you grab your extra fingers around to hold on to the controller.

621
00:39:50,328 --> 00:39:53,006
Scott: the virtual boy Was the first one that I remember.

622
00:39:53,026 --> 00:40:02,366
Scott: that had that where all your extra fingers grabbed on to this thing instead of floating around In the middle of nowhere, but the virtual boy was painful stupid terrible One of the worst things ever.

623
00:40:02,427 --> 00:40:04,920
Rym: Nintendo realized this right away and it basically just died.

624
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:07,650
Rym: Yeah, like no question Nintendo was like, alright fuck this.

625
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:08,734
Scott: No one bought it.

626
00:40:08,854 --> 00:40:09,657
Scott: No one wanted it.

627
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:10,520
Scott: Everything sucked.

628
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,880
Scott: They put it out on the shelves and then it was gone.

629
00:40:13,262 --> 00:40:15,899
Rym: I have a friend back in high school who still has his virtual boy.

630
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:36,573
Scott: Yeah having a virtual boy see the virtual boy taught me one thing whenever a new console comes out if There's a chance of it dying or you're not sure about it Especially if it's a Nintendo console just get it because at the best you have something that's gonna be awesome And at the worst like let's say the Wii completely bombs.

631
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:38,259
Scott: No one buys a Wii except you and me.

632
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:41,028
Scott: We'll be the only dudes with the Wii's.

633
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:44,020
Scott: it'll be cool like being the only dude who has a virtual boy.

634
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,350
Rym: Yeah, that's why we bought the DS early on cuz we weren't sure.

635
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,015
Rym: I I was really.

636
00:40:49,095 --> 00:40:50,761
Scott: I was only 75%.

637
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:52,751
Scott: Sure, the DS is gonna kick ass and I was.

638
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:59,276
Scott: I was a hundred percent sure it had potential But I was still cautious that people wouldn't take advantage of the potential and it would suck.

639
00:40:59,617 --> 00:41:00,620
Rym: Yeah, I was 50/50.

640
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,110
Rym: I was like wow, there's a good chance.

641
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:08,280
Scott: This is gonna fail, but I bought it Anyway, and I said it worst this will be virtual boy too and I'll have one and I'll be awesome.

642
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,990
Rym: Yeah, but oh my god, it didn't did not.

643
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:13,360
Rym: All right, um Atari back.

644
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:27,528
Rym: I mean it used to be like they're the 8-bit systems than NES the Sega and then saying a master system the 16-bit systems came out and right near the middle of their life cycle people were thinking All right, when's 32-bit coming?

645
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:29,835
Rym: because kids we really didn't understand what that meant.

646
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,360
Scott: We didn't know what that meant at all.

647
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:32,704
Rym: Their powers.

648
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:35,593
Scott: more bits meant better looking video games.

649
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,800
Scott: So better sounding video games.

650
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,280
Rym: So we were hearing the rumors of the 32-bit consoles, you know, like the PlayStation stuff like that.

651
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:47,980
Rym: Rumors rumors rumors not like not even real like the barest ass rumors.

652
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:54,740
Rym: then Atari was like we're gonna have a 64-bit console and everyone said what?

653
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,192
Scott: What whoa, whoa, there is status doubled the number two times.

654
00:41:59,272 --> 00:41:59,854
Scott: Holy shit.

655
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,720
Rym: Yeah 64-bit Oh my god.

656
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:08,260
Rym: And there were like tiny reviews like tiny screenshots from development things and like the buzz was crazy.

657
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:08,701
Rym: I

658
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:20,760
Scott: remember I was at a summer camp at day camp and I had read this news in the video game magazine And I went in and I said, you know, Atari's coming out with this 64-bit video game system called the Jaguar

659
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,983
Rym: Jaguar Jaguar

660
00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:26,091
Scott: the Jaguar and the kids are like you're lying.

661
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:28,939
Scott: Here's making shit up blah blah blah, but no I was right.

662
00:42:29,707 --> 00:42:30,258
Rym: haha.

663
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:33,728
Scott: The thing is the Jaguar sucked.

664
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,940
Rym: not only did it suck it wasn't really 64-bit Not really.

665
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:44,001
Rym: This is right about when we all learned what bits meant because we've someone smarter than us You know.

666
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:50,611
Rym: older kids who knew better would say things like it's not really 64-bit It's just two 32-bit chips blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

667
00:42:51,174 --> 00:42:54,052
Rym: and my brain said wait a minute research research.

668
00:42:54,112 --> 00:42:57,447
Rym: hey That's what bits are.

669
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:58,069
Scott: Yep.

670
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:07,313
Rym: I Learned about all the MMC chips in the different Nintendo games and why you couldn't go backwards in Mario 1 stuff like that.

671
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,988
Rym: Jaguar was a terrible failure and it died.

672
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:11,570
Scott: Let's see.

673
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,276
Scott: What was terrible at the Jaguar number one?

674
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:16,590
Scott: useless games number two There was some weird CD attachment thing.

675
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,433
Scott: That was just useless.

676
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:17,815
Rym: number three.

677
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:18,840
Rym: It was horribly expensive.

678
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,567
Scott: There were three is hardly sensitive number four.

679
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:24,040
Scott: It was real powerful, but the games weren't 3d or anything.

680
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,265
Scott: It didn't provide anything.

681
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:27,192
Scott: the 16-bit systems didn't provide.

682
00:43:27,212 --> 00:43:33,154
Rym: Yep, like number four the controller The controller it wasn't the worst controller ever.

683
00:43:33,174 --> 00:43:33,636
Scott: What do you thought?

684
00:43:33,656 --> 00:43:34,600
Scott: Do you remember the controller?

685
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,230
Rym: All right, I submit to you the fucking Intellivision to control.

686
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,860
Scott: No, look what did the Jaguar controller have?

687
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:47,326
Rym: All right The Intellivision 2 had a puck that didn't work and broke and instead of buttons it had four Depressions on the side of it.

688
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:52,308
Rym: you had to jam your fingernail in to make work The Jaguar at the top of it.

689
00:43:52,749 --> 00:44:10,431
Scott: It was this big square thing bigger than a Dreamcast controller but it was kind of flat and at the top there was like an arrow thing and some button things, but at the Majority of the controller was taken up by one button for I think every letter of the alphabet if I remember correctly It was insane.

690
00:44:10,512 --> 00:44:14,026
Rym: It was this monstrosity Like you.

691
00:44:14,047 --> 00:44:15,819
Rym: look at it and think what is that?

692
00:44:16,643 --> 00:44:18,269
Scott: What the fuck do I need those buttons for?

693
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,860
Scott: am I supposed to push all those buttons while I play a game?

694
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,350
Rym: That's bigger than my game gear.

695
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:23,438
Scott: What the hell?

696
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:25,904
Scott: It sucked.

697
00:44:26,105 --> 00:44:29,340
Rym: Also the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis were still going strong.

698
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:36,138
Scott: Yeah, so the Jaguar tried to come out to start the next generation while the 16-bit was still going strong.

699
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:36,720
Scott: bad move.

700
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,867
Scott: You got to wait until everyone knows.

701
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:43,120
Scott: you wait until the current generation starts to wane and then you start the new one.

702
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,160
Scott: That's the only reason that they keep coming out with new consoles.

703
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:52,100
Scott: They would be perfectly content to put out one console and just keep selling games for it forever.

704
00:44:52,160 --> 00:45:04,980
Scott: The reason they sell new consoles is because people lose interest and that when you come out with a new console Then the interest resurges they and you know, then it wanes and then you're releasing new console every four or five years.

705
00:45:05,146 --> 00:45:06,183
Rym: Yep Plus games.

706
00:45:06,223 --> 00:45:11,769
Rym: just you run out of potential in certain types of games because you've done everything that console can do other than just make More of the same.

707
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:17,027
Rym: Yep Alright now the Jaguar was terrible.

708
00:45:17,629 --> 00:45:21,960
Rym: the Sega 32x Sega CD all that Sega shit after.

709
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,782
Rym: Basically Sega after the Genesis went nowhere Okay.

710
00:45:25,863 --> 00:45:28,051
Scott: Well, there's the Sega Genesis is just fine.

711
00:45:28,553 --> 00:45:30,200
Scott: It's very popular around the world.

712
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:31,985
Rym: The master system really didn't do well.

713
00:45:32,185 --> 00:45:35,194
Scott: master system didn't do so well in America, but it did.

714
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,180
Scott: Okay, you know, it wasn't junk.

715
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,469
Scott: It was definitely wasn't junk.

716
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,820
Scott: like the Jaguar the virtual boy.

717
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,905
Rym: Nintendo was number one.

718
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:44,000
Rym: Sega was a trailing number two, but it was there and they were making money.

719
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,124
Rym: Yep, the Genesis.

720
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:48,537
Rym: they were much closer, but the Super Nintendo was still dominated far and away.

721
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:52,868
Rym: Not really Well, not counting foreign sales outside of America.

722
00:45:52,888 --> 00:45:57,000
Scott: in Japan in the 16-bit days the SNES and the Genesis were just like right on.

723
00:45:57,503 --> 00:45:59,900
Rym: I think the NES had a longer staying power.

724
00:46:00,823 --> 00:46:05,040
Scott: It did have a slightly longer staying power because what happened was the Sega Genesis.

725
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:06,969
Scott: They decided they're gonna do the Sega CD now.

726
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:09,440
Scott: the Sega CD wasn't a standalone console.

727
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,738
Scott: It was a thing you added on to the Genesis to play CD games and the CD games are still 16-bit games.

728
00:46:15,801 --> 00:46:22,839
Scott: They just had so much storage on the disc that they could have CD quality audio and videos and that sort of shit.

729
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,986
Rym: now What did they do with this amazing potential?

730
00:46:25,026 --> 00:46:26,571
Scott: They made crap-ass shit game.

731
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:28,136
Rym: They put FMV's and movies.

732
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:29,240
Rym: Oh my god.

733
00:46:29,441 --> 00:46:33,880
Scott: I think only good game for the Sega CD as far as I'm concerned is Sonic CD.

734
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,586
Rym: Remember that sewer rats game?

735
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:38,597
Rym: Yep, or there was the Sherlock Holmes sewer shark.

736
00:46:38,678 --> 00:46:41,989
Rym: sewer shark That's it or the Sherlock Holmes Jurassic Park.

737
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,080
Rym: as far as I could tell it was just movies of a guy who looked like Sherlock.

738
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:56,192
Scott: Yeah now the Sega CD originally was like more money than the say the Genesis itself and it was this giant thing bigger than a normal CD player that you Put under your Genesis.

739
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:57,040
Scott: It was crazy.

740
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,099
Rym: It was also expensive.

741
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:04,262
Scott: Then they came out with a better version of the Sega CD where you put your Genesis on it And it would.

742
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:09,180
Scott: the part that took the CDs was kind of to the right side of the Genesis and it was a lot better.

743
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:20,251
Scott: then They came out the 32 X. now the 32 X was the thing you put in the cartridge slot of the Genesis and then you But 32 X cartridges into it.

744
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:22,120
Rym: now think about all that for a minute.

745
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,284
Rym: Does that sound complicated?

746
00:47:23,364 --> 00:47:24,046
Rym: because it was.

747
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:25,310
Scott: it was people.

748
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:29,657
Scott: no one bought the 32 X. there were no games for it That were memorable or useful.

749
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:36,180
Scott: Supposedly if you had one it would improve the goodness of your Sega Genesis games that you put into it.

750
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,769
Scott: But I don't know about that.

751
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:38,755
Scott: I think that's not work shit.

752
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:52,296
Scott: Yeah So Sega CD 32 X games where if you had all three things the Genesis to see Sega CD in a 32 X all hooked Up into one monster system that you could play these games and no one played those.

753
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:53,480
Rym: Yeah, those games sold great.

754
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:54,519
Rym: I can't name one.

755
00:47:55,021 --> 00:48:03,628
Scott: there was a thing you could buy that was a Sega Genesis and a Sega CD combined into one device and then you could stick A 32 X into that.

756
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:05,700
Rym: that came out like the end of the life cycle.

757
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,908
Scott: That was the end and the Sega Genesis died.

758
00:48:08,491 --> 00:48:11,764
Scott: now the 32 X and the Sega CD were yes Those are the worst.

759
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:13,432
Scott: the genesis was not the word.

760
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:15,120
Rym: I never knew anyone who owned any of them.

761
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:16,600
Rym: I only played them at Funko Land.

762
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,395
Scott: I know people who had the Sega Genesis and I knew someone who had the Genesis.

763
00:48:20,515 --> 00:48:26,595
Scott: but no no Sega CD No one guy who had the Sega CD and no one had the 32 X. absolutely no one.

764
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:32,812
Rym: now the Sega Saturn Just to mention it was really badass and it failed for mostly.

765
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:41,480
Scott: Sega Saturn failed a lot in this country But it didn't fail in Japan and there are quite a few awesome games for the Sega Saturn that I want to play.

766
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,633
Scott: But I guess because it's too difficult to get the equipment.

767
00:48:45,014 --> 00:48:45,135
Scott: Yes.

768
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:46,360
Scott: We are the games are in Japanese.

769
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,500
Rym: We only mentioned the Sega Saturn because it is not on our worst list.

770
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:52,068
Rym: It is only worst because we didn't get to have it.

771
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:52,569
Scott: Yep.

772
00:48:53,352 --> 00:49:10,613
Scott: If only the Sega Saturn had somehow Come out with the only reason the PlayStation or the Saturn could survive You know against the n64 or even the SNES You know was because a Final Fantasy 7.

773
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:10,854
Scott: Yeah,

774
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:34,020
Rym: I know we say this a lot but really Nintendo and Sony had this and square there was this huge clusterfuck and The the higher-ups of Nintendo and square had a fight like angry at each other over the technology and the direction of the games and Nintendo's refusal to switch away from cartridges and They jump ship from Nintendo to Sony and that was like that.

775
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,447
Rym: That was the linchpin in the video game industry.

776
00:49:36,788 --> 00:49:42,267
Scott: if it wasn't for Final Fantasy 7 the PlayStation 1 would have died The Sega Saturn would have died.

777
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:45,199
Scott: the n64 would have been the only thing there was.

778
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,672
Rym: Yep, Freddy if you were too young to remember this, you know now like when the Xbox when?

779
00:49:49,174 --> 00:49:59,445
Rym: when the Xbox was first announced When it was so told that Microsoft was making a console the world of nerds who heard this laugh their asses off and just oh My god, how could this be?

780
00:49:59,485 --> 00:50:03,040
Rym: This is the stupidest thing ever and when the Xbox came out it did terribly.

781
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:06,634
Scott: They lost I think about four billion dollars in the Xbox.

782
00:50:06,714 --> 00:50:07,659
Rym: It did so terrible.

783
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:08,383
Rym: now They're okay.

784
00:50:08,523 --> 00:50:11,900
Rym: Yeah, because while no one bought it Microsoft had so much money.

785
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:17,840
Rym: They just kept pumping money and pumping research and pumping games and pumping everything into it to keep it afloat until it took off.

786
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,475
Rym: Sony succeeded because of Final Fantasy.

787
00:50:21,757 --> 00:50:32,657
Rym: Yep But when Sony when it was announced that Sony was making a console before we knew any of this Final Fantasy stuff It was treated by the gaming community the same way that Microsoft was.

788
00:50:32,677 --> 00:50:35,869
Rym: when they announced the Xbox People said Sony can't make games.

789
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:36,612
Rym: What the hell.

790
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:38,440
Rym: who could beat Sega and Nintendo?

791
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:43,576
Scott: Yeah, when I first saw the PlayStation in those game pro magazines, it looked to me like 3do2.

792
00:50:44,821 --> 00:50:47,010
Scott: I was like up here comes more 3do type shit.

793
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:51,950
Scott: the Sega Saturn at least kind of made sense You know, even though it died.

794
00:50:51,970 --> 00:51:00,926
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people rooted for the Sega Saturn Yep, but in the n64, I was actually kind of about it Especially the weird-looking controller.

795
00:51:00,986 --> 00:51:02,532
Scott: that didn't seem to find an advantage.

796
00:51:02,853 --> 00:51:03,877
Scott: actually until you had the 3d game.

797
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,336
Rym: What really got me there was that right around n64 is when PC gaming it kind of exploded.

798
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,540
Scott: Yeah, that's also true.

799
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,386
Rym: That was like I would consider that the golden age of PC gaming there was 96 yeah, like that whole air.

800
00:51:16,426 --> 00:51:22,127
Rym: basically my high school consisted of only PC games and Original SNES NES games.

801
00:51:22,508 --> 00:51:26,100
Scott: the 64 actually came out the year after the PlayStation in the Saturn.

802
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,380
Scott: It was sort of a response, you know more than a also ran.

803
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:41,720
Scott: Yeah, so if the PlayStation didn't have Final Fantasy 7 then you know Who knows maybe the SNES would have gone even longer or the n64 would have been different or who knows?

804
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:51,040
Rym: That was also really the point at which Nintendo went from being this crazy like Monopoly on gaming to just a profitable game company.

805
00:51:51,261 --> 00:51:56,056
Scott: Yep, and the PC gaming really did take a lot away from the consoles in the late 90s.

806
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:58,720
Rym: Yeah Well, we do a whole show on that.

807
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:04,480
Scott: Those are the days when there was Windows 95 starting with Windows 95 PC gaming got huge.

808
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:24,030
Scott: Yeah, well, that's when like OpenGL and all those sorts of things and people, you know games like met courier to Half-Life 1 I Counter-strike quake to wake to wait - was like huge quake one Doom it was.

809
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:24,734
Scott: it was earlier.

810
00:52:24,754 --> 00:52:32,496
Scott: That was like 94 95 Yeah, but yeah in the late DOS days in the early Windows 95 98 days Grand Theft Auto 1.

811
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:45,470
Rym: for the Windows 95 I mean gaming really splintered and the whole market was civilization - this was a period when console gaming a lot of people were Thinking that maybe it was going to die and be replaced by PC gaming.

812
00:52:46,193 --> 00:52:54,540
Scott: and then Final Fantasy playstation 1 All that kind of it was really Final Fantasy 7 on the PlayStation and Goldeneye.

813
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:00,808
Scott: They carried the consoles over it, you know to The current generation which is now ending.

814
00:53:01,189 --> 00:53:04,340
Rym: Yep, because the current generation is really when PC gaming.

815
00:53:04,562 --> 00:53:06,500
Rym: We're not gonna have this argument again with all of our list.

816
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:11,010
Rym: Well, not all of our listeners But a few loud members of our listening audience started to fade away again.

817
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:15,514
Rym: PC gaming started dying and console gaming is taking off crazy again.

818
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,450
Rym: Yep now we've talked for a long time.

819
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,440
Rym: So we're gonna try to be brief on the rest of our list.

820
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,486
Rym: we've got a lot of worse here because they're game consoles are something that are really.

821
00:53:27,827 --> 00:53:35,180
Scott: they either win big or they fail miserably because you have to sell hardware at a loss and Then you have to sell expensive razor blade games.

822
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:46,775
Scott: Yep, and with that business model if you manage to sell people enough people the console at a loss then you win But if you don't then you just lost a giant pile of money and you fail.

823
00:53:46,795 --> 00:53:48,140
Rym: there's very little middle ground.

824
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,256
Rym: I mean the game gear was middle ground because the game gear did okay, but it did didn't.

825
00:53:52,276 --> 00:53:53,320
Scott: it didn't you either?

826
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,153
Scott: You can do it, but you have to keep it going so rare.

827
00:53:56,435 --> 00:54:00,000
Rym: if you're in that middle ground You're like a crazy anomaly in the gaming industry.

828
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:04,380
Scott: Releasing a new game console is like one of the worst business decisions you can do.

829
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:10,540
Rym: Yeah, except Nintendo, which they're really the only company now that makes a profit on their consoles even early on.

830
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:17,893
Scott: Well, I think what they do is when they make the console they think about, you know We will not possibly do anything to not profit.

831
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:21,518
Scott: Yeah Nintendo to not profit No one would have to buy this at all.

832
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:28,368
Rym: Nintendo is one of the most profitable percentage wise corporations in the world In terms of expenditures versus not.

833
00:54:28,428 --> 00:54:36,160
Rym: it's yeah, not total money no, but not by far God, you know Hello Burton in Blackwater, but yeah, Nintendo is insanely profitable.

834
00:54:36,281 --> 00:54:38,755
Rym: So all these people who keep saying oh Nintendo is dying.

835
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:42,406
Rym: Nintendo is dying I mean especially in the n64 like the late n64.

836
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:51,477
Rym: days before the GameCube came out a lot of people kept saying Nintendo was dying not Noticing that Nintendo was raking in gobs and gobs of cash.

837
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:59,571
Scott: Yep I mean if Rym has a giant company that says sells a billion widgets for a dot and he makes a dollar profit on each One he's got a billion dollars.

838
00:55:00,014 --> 00:55:00,680
Scott: That's awesome.

839
00:55:01,362 --> 00:55:11,200
Scott: Let's say, you know, I have a company and I sell a hundred thousand widgets But I get a hundred dollars profit on each one because I'm awesome with my profit margins.

840
00:55:11,782 --> 00:55:13,146
Scott: Well, I'm not.

841
00:55:13,206 --> 00:55:17,440
Scott: I might not be as big a company as Rym but goddamn if I ain't making a shit ton of money.

842
00:55:17,762 --> 00:55:19,434
Rym: Yep, Nintendo's in no danger.

843
00:55:19,455 --> 00:55:20,180
Scott: Not at all.

844
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:30,200
Rym: In fact, I'll note that on the news that this is just an aside when the Microsoft guy said that you should buy a Wii Nintendo stock rose almost 6%.

845
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,951
Scott: Yep, it like Nintendo stock is going up because the Wii line.

846
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,117
Scott: Yes, and all the Wii news.

847
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:37,423
Scott: and yeah All right.

848
00:55:37,443 --> 00:55:38,793
Scott: So let's talk about worst video game.

849
00:55:38,853 --> 00:55:39,095
Scott: All right.

850
00:55:39,115 --> 00:55:44,960
Scott: All right, so Gizmondo, all right The gizmondo wasn't really a serious thing.

851
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:49,091
Scott: What it was is Stefan Eriksson and some other European mafia dudes.

852
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:50,917
Rym: Yeah, really mafia.

853
00:55:50,957 --> 00:55:51,498
Rym: We're not kidding.

854
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:52,120
Rym: Yeah, really?

855
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:56,660
Scott: They made up this portable gaming console and some of it was interesting.

856
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:03,410
Scott: They said it was gonna have a GPS and that it would have some online Features and other stuff and that got me kind of interested.

857
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:06,460
Scott: like on I'd like to play some GPS enabled games.

858
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:23,214
Scott: The problem was is their idea was to have two versions of the gizmondo one That was ludicrously expensive like as expensive as an xbox 360 Or the other version which was a little bit expensive like a couple hundred bucks that would have Advertisements while you played great.

859
00:56:23,234 --> 00:56:24,120
Rym: Just about yeah.

860
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:30,642
Scott: And there were no games for it and it was all really just a big scam for them to make up giant pile of mafia Money.

861
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:34,040
Rym: and then he crashed his Ferrari and then it was all found out about the mafia.

862
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:36,931
Scott: Yeah, and the gizmondo died almost immediately.

863
00:56:36,951 --> 00:56:37,815
Scott: It was hilarious.

864
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:41,627
Scott: the end now This was very recently too like within the past year.

865
00:56:42,088 --> 00:56:45,056
Rym: now, there's another similar situation with the phantom.

866
00:56:45,076 --> 00:56:48,367
Scott: Oh You're gonna talk about the phantom real briefly.

867
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:49,371
Rym: The Phantom was a concept.

868
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:50,174
Rym: was what Infinium?

869
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:50,796
Rym: Infinium?

870
00:56:50,937 --> 00:56:51,820
Scott: Yes Infinium Labs.

871
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:55,533
Rym: they said a long time ago that they were gonna make this console.

872
00:56:55,574 --> 00:57:05,844
Scott: that was gonna blow the industry away and The idea of the phantom was that you would buy PC games put them in the phantom and they would just work without dealing with PC game bullshit.

873
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:12,680
Rym: now it basically became apparent over the years because over the years that no phantom was ever made or released.

874
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:19,771
Scott: They just kept saying it was coming and they had pieces of plastic in the shape of a console that they said was the phantom But there was nothing inside the.

875
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:21,280
Rym: it is my opinion.

876
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:32,760
Rym: I'm saying this only because I do not want to get sued because I do not have actual evidence on me That the phantom was like the gizmondo a scam to get money from venture capitalists and nothing more.

877
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:37,034
Scott: That's what it seems like and if it wasn't then they just really really suck.

878
00:57:37,235 --> 00:57:38,760
Rym: Yeah, it's either evil or incompetence.

879
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,927
Rym: There's no middle ground there or incompetent evil.

880
00:57:41,328 --> 00:57:44,497
Rym: Yeah, which once again, they should cancel each other out, but they don't.

881
00:57:44,618 --> 00:57:53,343
Scott: Yeah One good thing did come out of the phantom, which was the keyboard that was easy to use while sitting on the couch Which it didn't actually come out yet.

882
00:57:53,524 --> 00:57:59,140
Scott: and we're still waiting because they're supposedly going to release that whether the phantom ever actually exists or not.

883
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:05,020
Scott: So we're waiting for it and we want it because a keyboard from the couch is what I need but strangely it was delayed.

884
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:06,000
Scott: Oh, really?

885
00:58:07,142 --> 00:58:10,093
Scott: At least there was a picture of it and someone else can make something similar.

886
00:58:10,515 --> 00:58:11,700
Rym: All right game.com.

887
00:58:12,542 --> 00:58:19,851
Scott: The game.com was a handheld system made by tiger who made all those little tiger LCD games Which I think we're terrible, but I seem to like.

888
00:58:19,992 --> 00:58:21,119
Scott: I like and they're okay.

889
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:23,765
Scott: And what it was?

890
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:29,011
Scott: you'd put cartridges in it to play games a lot like the game boy But I had higher resolution in the game boy.

891
00:58:29,071 --> 00:58:30,659
Scott: The screen was actually black and white.

892
00:58:31,661 --> 00:58:35,912
Scott: It had Duke Nukem and I think another FPS game and you know the games.

893
00:58:36,393 --> 00:58:41,080
Scott: they didn't stand up because well There was really no publicity.

894
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,080
Rym: I had actually never heard of this until Scott mentioned it while we were coming up with what our worst.

895
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:51,602
Scott: Now one of the features of this thing that actually had me thinking about it for a little bit was that it had internet Abilities.

896
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:56,800
Scott: you could put your high scores online and you could check your email with it and all kinds of stuff.

897
00:58:56,961 --> 00:58:58,800
Scott: The problem was you know, he got it online.

898
00:58:59,545 --> 00:59:10,853
Scott: you plugged it into a modem and then It could only go on the internet with text and you had to pay for this online Service and like no one paid for it was just okay.

899
00:59:10,873 --> 00:59:12,459
Rym: I think it's obvious why that failed.

900
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:19,430
Scott: Yeah Go read about the game.com G-a-m-e-dot-c-o-m and it's hilarious.

901
00:59:19,651 --> 00:59:21,275
Scott: who even thought of that and why?

902
00:59:21,737 --> 00:59:21,977
Scott: you know.

903
00:59:22,298 --> 00:59:24,633
Scott: in those days It seemed kind of cool, but nowadays.

904
00:59:24,653 --> 00:59:31,076
Rym: Oh, man All right We're gonna run through some non console but console accessory stuff real quick.

905
00:59:31,116 --> 00:59:33,265
Rym: just because they have to be worth mention They have to be mentioned.

906
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:35,919
Rym: the power glove was so bad.

907
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:38,293
Scott: It's so bad.

908
00:59:38,454 --> 00:59:39,379
Rym: He touched my boob.

909
00:59:41,322 --> 00:59:49,209
Rym: If the power glove looked really cool the ads made it look awesome and wearing it made you feel really cool Until you tried to use it.

910
00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:50,374
Rym: It didn't work.

911
00:59:50,515 --> 00:59:51,620
Scott: It didn't work at all.

912
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:57,480
Scott: I think the pat the the Wii technology is actually just updated working power glove technology.

913
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:08,240
Rym: Yeah, Nintendo seemed to have this problem back then, you know Virtual Boy power glove of trying to do something before the technology Existed brought to work properly at a price people could afford and now they learn that lesson.

914
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:12,780
Scott: But at least you can see that Nintendo has always been trying to do something new and different.

915
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:15,630
Rym: Yeah, because they they also came out with the you force.

916
01:00:16,192 --> 01:00:16,473
Scott: Yeah.

917
01:00:16,673 --> 01:00:17,757
Scott: Well, that wasn't Nintendo.

918
01:00:17,777 --> 01:00:18,540
Scott: That was a third party.

919
01:00:18,721 --> 01:00:20,034
Rym: Oh, yeah, but it was for the Nintendo.

920
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,723
Rym: Oh, yeah Didn't work.

921
01:00:23,105 --> 01:00:24,573
Scott: No you force didn't work at all.

922
01:00:24,613 --> 01:00:30,436
Scott: You force is like this Helmet thing with a targeting reticle that went over your eyeball.

923
01:00:30,476 --> 01:00:31,420
Rym: No, that was something else.

924
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,504
Scott: Oh was it you force?

925
01:00:32,544 --> 01:00:32,905
Rym: was this?

926
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:37,956
Rym: it looked like a laptop that you opened and you could move your hands in front of it To control games.

927
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:39,986
Rym: Oh It was for Nintendo.

928
01:00:40,006 --> 01:00:40,790
Rym: Oh, I don't know.

929
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,800
Rym: I'm pretty sure Nintendo made it, huh?

930
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,349
Scott: Cuz like yeah, I know you're thinking about.

931
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:46,280
Rym: I forget what it's called, but I just looked at a picture of it.

932
01:00:46,762 --> 01:00:47,846
Rym: It was just as bad cuz.

933
01:00:47,886 --> 01:00:48,328
Rym: it didn't work.

934
01:00:48,368 --> 01:00:50,516
Rym: You could say like fire fire fire.

935
01:00:50,576 --> 01:00:50,757
Rym: Yep.

936
01:00:50,877 --> 01:00:53,360
Rym: That was that one Yeah, and it didn't work at all.

937
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:54,664
Rym: It was crap.

938
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:59,000
Scott: now Sega had some other bad purples the menacer which is his gun.

939
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:07,927
Scott: It was a light gun basically and you could had three parts and you could reconfigure the light gun to be like a rifle a pistol And a thing with the scope.

940
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,020
Scott: it was in response to the super scope.

941
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,406
Scott: The super scope wasn't the worst.

942
01:01:11,466 --> 01:01:14,900
Scott: the menacer was the worst because there are really no games that use the menacer.

943
01:01:15,162 --> 01:01:18,363
Rym: Yeah, there weren't many games with the super scope either No, but they both.

944
01:01:18,404 --> 01:01:19,928
Scott: scope actually wasn't the worst.

945
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,496
Rym: like the manager the super scope was good technology.

946
01:01:22,576 --> 01:01:23,580
Rym: It was a good thing.

947
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:26,248
Rym: Mostly it just it wasn't.

948
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:26,629
Rym: really.

949
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:31,002
Rym: that wasn't the type of gaming that was gonna be popular then and no one really made a good Game for it.

950
01:01:31,343 --> 01:01:33,751
Scott: Nope, but the menacer was just terrible and useless.

951
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:35,577
Scott: and the Sega activator?

952
01:01:35,718 --> 01:01:37,725
Scott: God The Sega activator.

953
01:01:37,765 --> 01:01:38,930
Rym: what it could have been so cool.

954
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:39,673
Scott: It could have been done.

955
01:01:39,713 --> 01:01:41,440
Scott: What it was was an octagon.

956
01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:47,360
Scott: Yes an octagon octagonal bodies Octagonal bunnies, okay.

957
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,600
Scott: So you take this big plastic octagon and you put it on the floor kind of like a para para pad.

958
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:56,426
Scott: Well para para flowers.

959
01:01:56,487 --> 01:02:00,080
Scott: Yeah, and each side of the octagon has a little sensor.

960
01:02:00,482 --> 01:02:24,256
Scott: So when you wave your hand over that area in the sky, you know You just stand in the middle of the octagon and you wave your body parts and you you know You you over these sensors on the eight sides of the octagon and each side of the octagon was mapped to a different button on the Sega Genesis, so that was ABC up down left right and Start that's eight.

961
01:02:25,244 --> 01:02:32,100
Rym: Now you'd think you could do cool things with this, you know fighting games But no one made a fighting game that used it in an intuitive or fun way.

962
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,789
Scott: Oh, no, they were fighting games that used it.

963
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,860
Rym: No that used it in an intuitive and fun.

964
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,175
Scott: Well, it couldn't be used an intuitive and fun way because it was neither intuitive nor fun.

965
01:02:39,315 --> 01:02:52,780
Scott: Oh See the commercials and the ads made it looked like you would stand inside this thing and actually fight like you would do kung fu Standing inside the octagon and the fighting guy on the screen would do the kung fu that you did.

966
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,308
Rym: Yeah, the ads were real deceptive in reality.

967
01:02:55,349 --> 01:02:58,519
Scott: You just kind of waved your arms and legs over the edges of it.

968
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,455
Scott: You know to put in the same case real inaccurate it did.

969
01:03:02,535 --> 01:03:03,619
Rym: it just didn't really work.

970
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:06,631
Scott: It didn't work nearly as well as a pair of flower does.

971
01:03:06,692 --> 01:03:08,720
Scott: it was useless and silly and a waste of money.

972
01:03:09,222 --> 01:03:20,904
Scott: I mean it seems like a lot of times in the early video game days People just made stuff that to fool kids into buying something that was useless and shitty and nowadays No one really does that anymore.

973
01:03:21,085 --> 01:03:22,349
Rym: course kids were easily fooled.

974
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:25,900
Rym: I remember lawsuits and problems because this is kind of an aside.

975
01:03:25,961 --> 01:03:27,679
Scott: It's true, but we don't get fooled again.

976
01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:29,355
Rym: Fool me once.

977
01:03:33,062 --> 01:03:35,870
Rym: All right, but back way back there was the game.

978
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:39,460
Rym: clue, you know the silly American board game clue with a little flip-ups.

979
01:03:39,801 --> 01:03:40,425
Rym: Yeah, or not?

980
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:40,746
Rym: clue.

981
01:03:40,786 --> 01:03:43,058
Rym: Why am I thinking clue guess who guess who I?

982
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,004
Rym: Don't know why I have a beard.

983
01:03:46,024 --> 01:03:47,529
Rym: does your guy wear glasses.

984
01:03:47,549 --> 01:03:49,454
Scott: I think you have a woman.

985
01:03:49,936 --> 01:03:56,135
Rym: now when they Advertise this game it showed the characters in the board talking which was obviously just.

986
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:57,258
Rym: you know a funny thing.

987
01:03:57,299 --> 01:04:02,459
Rym: in the ad A lot of kids thought the game really talked and their parents sued when the game didn't talk.

988
01:04:03,262 --> 01:04:04,627
Rym: So they had to change the ad.

989
01:04:04,647 --> 01:04:06,514
Rym: yep, so back then?

990
01:04:06,534 --> 01:04:14,137
Rym: well kids are probably just as gullible today But back then it seems like the gaming industry tried to market to those kids specifically to fool them.

991
01:04:14,157 --> 01:04:22,980
Scott: a Lot of things are just fooling kids into thinking that some Crapass electronic gizmo was so amazing when it wasn't like talking battleship.

992
01:04:23,723 --> 01:04:35,789
Scott: we had electronic like one of the old electronic talking battleships and When it worked which I think we only played it when it worked once it was okay But it wasn't nearly like the commercial said.

993
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:37,495
Scott: it was just bad.

994
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:41,935
Rym: Yeah Plus battleships kind of a broken game.

995
01:04:41,955 --> 01:04:47,497
Rym: Yeah It's all it is is implement the perfect the most optimal search algorithm.

996
01:04:47,518 --> 01:04:49,246
Rym: Mm-hmm Oh, we were both implementing it.

997
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:50,935
Rym: now the game comes down to the random placement.

998
01:04:51,357 --> 01:04:57,620
Scott: Yep So it's all about the placement of the ships and secretly moving the ships to pull your opponent and cheating.

999
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,667
Rym: Yeah, until Rym says wait a minute.

1000
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:02,036
Rym: I have a white peg on before you ass fucker.

1001
01:05:02,056 --> 01:05:03,200
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

1002
01:05:04,762 --> 01:05:05,807
Scott: You always see what you drew.

1003
01:05:05,887 --> 01:05:06,792
Scott: you do in battleship.

1004
01:05:07,254 --> 01:05:08,440
Scott: is you move the ship?

1005
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:12,460
Scott: That's only two spots and you always put it somewhere.

1006
01:05:12,693 --> 01:05:14,044
Rym: No You know what you do when you're gonna cheat.

1007
01:05:14,365 --> 01:05:17,757
Rym: you put white pegs on your board where the other guy shot.

1008
01:05:18,038 --> 01:05:20,096
Rym: that way you know exactly where you can cheat to.

1009
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:27,240
Rym: I Do that anyway, ah, you know most people didn't because there wasn't any reason to unless you're cheating.

1010
01:05:27,909 --> 01:05:28,680
Scott: No, I did it anyway.

1011
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,724
Scott: so I knew where everyone.

1012
01:05:30,045 --> 01:05:40,200
Scott: I had the whole layout on my board and what I also did is I would take the ship that Was only two spots and I would figure out the other person search algorithm and I'd put the ship.

1013
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,529
Scott: That was only two spots in the place.

1014
01:05:42,569 --> 01:05:44,637
Scott: They were least likely to go after next.

1015
01:05:45,781 --> 01:05:49,353
Rym: Yeah, my search algorithm was fairly complex, but the game was stupid.

1016
01:05:49,715 --> 01:05:51,260
Rym: It's we're not gonna put it on our worst games.

1017
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,485
Rym: Maybe we'll do a battleship.

1018
01:05:52,545 --> 01:05:53,590
Scott: It's not a worst game.

1019
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,217
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna our worst board games.

1020
01:05:55,277 --> 01:05:55,819
Rym: It's just hellas.

1021
01:05:56,181 --> 01:05:59,360
Scott: Yeah, well there's other worst board games that we can talk about those some other time.

1022
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,650
Scott: We're only talking about the worst game consoles and peripherals.

1023
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:03,779
Rym: Yep, and I think we're pretty much done here.

1024
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:06,046
Scott: Didn't you want to yell about the Atari?

1025
01:06:06,367 --> 01:06:06,969
Rym: Oh, yeah.

1026
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,654
Rym: I just noticed at the top of my list.

1027
01:06:08,694 --> 01:06:10,720
Rym: I missed it real briefly.

1028
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:14,860
Rym: I had an Atari 2600 and I still have an Atari 7800.

1029
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:19,138
Scott: We had the Atari 2600 and then it died and then we didn't have video games till the NES.

1030
01:06:19,579 --> 01:06:23,823
Rym: now The 7800 is just the advancement of the 2600.

1031
01:06:23,823 --> 01:06:26,979
Rym: It was fully backward compatible, but there were also games for it.

1032
01:06:26,979 --> 01:06:31,574
Scott: 7800 could play every 2600 game but could also play special 7200 games.

1033
01:06:31,594 --> 01:06:33,521
Scott: It was 7800.

1034
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:34,905
Rym: It was actually very powerful.

1035
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:42,312
Rym: the 7800 could make games or play games about the level of the first non MMC Nintendo games.

1036
01:06:43,057 --> 01:06:53,970
Rym: Yeah Like gyromite you could probably play Yeah Or the games like this for the brother fighting game in the streets in the early Challenge urban challenge the early sports games.

1037
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:55,857
Scott: you could play those in an Atari 7800 probably.

1038
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,504
Scott: Yeah, you did some.

1039
01:06:57,524 --> 01:07:01,300
Scott: really Donkey Kong is perfect because it was exactly the same on both systems.

1040
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:05,110
Rym: Yeah, the NES was actually a really really regular Mario Brothers.

1041
01:07:05,431 --> 01:07:07,777
Rym: Yeah, right now regular Mario Brothers was an MMC chip.

1042
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,382
Scott: Oh Was it really?

1043
01:07:09,502 --> 01:07:11,929
Scott: Yeah, because it was on the 7800.

1044
01:07:11,929 --> 01:07:12,792
Scott: It was almost perfect.

1045
01:07:13,193 --> 01:07:15,660
Rym: Why it's when where I'm pretty sure it was.

1046
01:07:15,921 --> 01:07:17,553
Rym: Oh, no, the Mario Brothers.

1047
01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:18,560
Rym: I was thinking you said Super Mario.

1048
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,984
Scott: No, I said a regular Mario Brothers.

1049
01:07:20,004 --> 01:07:23,676
Rym: the Mario Brothers in the Atari was good, but it wasn't perfect.

1050
01:07:23,816 --> 01:07:27,208
Rym: It had a lot of Issues made it different from the real game.

1051
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:28,593
Scott: Yeah, it was still good enough.

1052
01:07:28,874 --> 01:07:30,680
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, I was off.

1053
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,850
Rym: I thought you said Super Nintendo.

1054
01:07:31,971 --> 01:07:32,495
Scott: Oh hell no.

1055
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:38,203
Rym: Yeah but the problem was that you couldn't extend the 7800 the Nintendo.

1056
01:07:38,524 --> 01:07:43,380
Rym: you could put chips in the cartridges to do more because the Nintendo itself was really really really weak.

1057
01:07:43,882 --> 01:08:02,719
Scott: An actual NES doesn't have a lot of stuff in it But you could put stuff in the cartridges to make it more off high-end NES games like Mario 3. almost everything was happening in the cartridge and that was part of the reason why the NES lasted so long was because the cartridges, you know Mario 3 was.

1058
01:08:03,821 --> 01:08:16,733
Scott: It seemed like if you look at Mario 3 and Super Mario Brothers 1 and you say that was the best the console could do At that time it's like they switched to a whole new console, but no it was the same thing And that's why the NES lasted like eight years.

1059
01:08:16,752 --> 01:08:16,813
Rym: Yep.

1060
01:08:17,756 --> 01:08:23,755
Scott: Whereas nowadays You can't you have CDs and things you can't put something in the CD to make the console better.

1061
01:08:23,774 --> 01:08:24,979
Scott: You know, that's it.

1062
01:08:25,921 --> 01:08:27,488
Scott: You see this console is the console.

1063
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:28,653
Scott: It doesn't get more powerful.

1064
01:08:28,712 --> 01:08:30,420
Scott: You can't make the game is better over time.

1065
01:08:31,022 --> 01:08:34,317
Scott: So the consoles don't last more than four years now.

1066
01:08:34,337 --> 01:08:39,220
Rym: the 2600 7800 was a clear progression and they didn't do great and they lost money.

1067
01:08:39,341 --> 01:08:42,080
Rym: But that's due to a number of reasons that weren't all Atari's fault.

1068
01:08:43,782 --> 01:08:48,819
Rym: The 5200 came between the two and it was the bastard child that was completely different from both of them.

1069
01:08:49,322 --> 01:08:51,029
Rym: It was a terrible console.

1070
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:52,877
Rym: It had some good games, but it was just.

1071
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:57,711
Rym: it Epitomizes everything that was wrong with the gaming industry back in that day.

1072
01:08:57,731 --> 01:09:00,800
Rym: It was a miserable miserable failure.

1073
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,404
Scott: Yeah, go look it up.

1074
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:03,267
Scott: It's just bad.

1075
01:09:03,346 --> 01:09:05,694
Rym: Yeah, I don't really sucked.

1076
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:06,437
Scott: It was useless.

1077
01:09:06,457 --> 01:09:07,500
Scott: The controller was weird.

1078
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,189
Rym: Yeah, there's not much I can say about it just terrible.

1079
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:19,037
Rym: I wanted one when I was a kid just because I heard about it I didn't know what it was and it sounded kind of mystical and cool because no one had heard of it.

1080
01:09:20,004 --> 01:09:25,205
Scott: All I really knew is that we had an Atari the wood panels 2600 and it didn't work.

1081
01:09:25,265 --> 01:09:31,144
Scott: and I wanted it to work and our friend had a different looking Atari and He had the same game.

1082
01:09:31,184 --> 01:09:35,960
Scott: So I think you might add a 7800 but I didn't know the numbers and what different things were.

1083
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,626
Rym: 7800 sitting right there.

1084
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:38,368
Rym: We can go look at it.

1085
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:43,969
Scott: I know what it looks like now, but it back in the kiddie days I didn't know the Atari said numbers.

1086
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:46,840
Scott: I said, oh he has an Atari that looks different, you know.

1087
01:09:46,923 --> 01:09:56,539
Scott: Yeah it's like the difference between the Intellivision and the Intellivision 2 and I didn't know it in any s was until I went over my cousin's house and he's like Hey I got this thing and we had to wait for the dads to give up the only TV.

1088
01:09:57,101 --> 01:10:02,059
Scott: Now he turned it on and Super Mario Brothers was there and I was like, oh, what is this?

1089
01:10:02,802 --> 01:10:06,177
Scott: And I you know, I didn't really get it and I died in the first goomba like everyone else.

1090
01:10:06,258 --> 01:10:17,809
Scott: and And then we played a little bit and then that was that and you know then later I Yeah, but I think we've talked about everything.

1091
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:20,537
Rym: We've hated about console gaming in the last couple decades.

1092
01:10:20,577 --> 01:10:22,225
Scott: It's not everything we hated It's the worst.

1093
01:10:22,507 --> 01:10:24,260
Rym: Yeah, but I noticed that we hated everything here.

1094
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,372
Rym: That was also a worst except the game gear and the Saturn.

1095
01:10:27,412 --> 01:10:34,619
Scott: it's because smart people hate the worst shit Like the worst shit, you're not really a smart dude or you're just really weird.

1096
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,184
Rym: though I did really like the game here.

1097
01:10:36,285 --> 01:10:37,368
Rym: I can't pretend I didn't.

1098
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,314
Scott: I kind of like the game.

1099
01:10:39,354 --> 01:10:41,080
Rym: crystal warriors is a great game.

1100
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,852
Rym: It's apparently it's very similar to Fire Emblem.

1101
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:45,700
Rym: It's actually a lot like Advance Wars.

1102
01:10:46,061 --> 01:10:50,580
Scott: I would play the game gear at my friend's house who had one and I have to sit there plugged into the wall playing it.

1103
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:57,753
Scott: It wasn't a really poorly wars for it was really the only shmoop I ever liked and I remember playing Aladdin for it and a Sonic game.

1104
01:10:57,793 --> 01:10:58,840
Scott: and the Sonic game was okay.

1105
01:10:58,981 --> 01:11:08,004
Scott: God the Sonic game for it was good But it was hard and it wasn't anything near anywhere near as good as the Sonic 2 & 3 for the Sega Genesis Which are amazing.

1106
01:11:08,105 --> 01:11:11,195
Rym: Yeah, the Sega the Sega game gear Sonic game.

1107
01:11:11,235 --> 01:11:12,741
Rym: I think it was called Sonic 2.

1108
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:15,774
Scott: I think it was called Sonic 2, but it wasn't really Sonic 2.

1109
01:11:15,774 --> 01:11:17,140
Scott: It was just another Sonic game.

1110
01:11:17,421 --> 01:11:18,747
Rym: That thing was hard as hell.

1111
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:20,615
Rym: It sure was I never.

1112
01:11:20,635 --> 01:11:21,680
Scott: Sonic games are hard.

1113
01:11:22,101 --> 01:11:24,128
Scott: Sonic 2 is easy because I've mastered it.

1114
01:11:24,289 --> 01:11:26,095
Scott: Yeah, Sonic 1 is a little bit harder.

1115
01:11:26,477 --> 01:11:33,540
Scott: Sonic 3 Like the first few levels are easy, but then it gets hard at Sonic and Knuckles is wicked hard.

1116
01:11:33,861 --> 01:11:34,586
Rym: I'm not Dan.

1117
01:11:34,626 --> 01:11:35,350
Rym: We got to stop.
