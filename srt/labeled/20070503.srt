00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,936
Rym: It's Thursday, May 3rd.

2
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:12,939
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:18,252
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

4
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:22,610
Rym: we respond to your requests and do a show that was suggested to us via email.

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,823
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:32,049
Scott: I Was doing something today that I don't do so often anymore that is put gas in my car.

7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,423
Scott: You know now that I don't drive to the middle of nowhere every day.

8
00:00:34,463 --> 00:00:35,630
Scott: I just drive to a train station.

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,759
Scott: That's five minutes from my house.

10
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:49,215
Scott: I get gas Rarely, so I'm at the gas station pumping the gas and this guy There's two guys in their car on the other at the other pump and the guys like hey How fast that go.

11
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:51,665
Scott: and I'm thinking he's talking about the gas pump.

12
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:56,628
Scott: cuz you know some gas stations They fiddle with the pump to scam you out of some money And then they don't give you know.

13
00:00:57,091 --> 00:01:02,970
Scott: They make the pump like that the counter goes a little slower and the gas comes out or something like that.

14
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,750
Rym: See while I know they check gas stations very rigorously.

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:21,470
Rym: I remember a case in Michigan back when I was a kid where they caught a gas station where they had a lamp and If you turned the knob on the lamp it didn't turn on the light in the lamp It switched all the gas pumps to rip people off and they knew they knew what the inspectors looked like.

16
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:27,366
Rym: So whenever and they watch and whenever those people were there or whenever they knew they were coming They'd make him legit, and then they put him back.

17
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:34,070
Rym: otherwise Wow wow so the fact that they got caught gives me a little bit of hope that people look into those sorts of things.

18
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:42,370
Scott: Yeah, plus there was some lady yelling about the gas being 320 And I thought that maybe they were you know wondering if my gas pump was like scamming or something.

19
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,138
Scott: But then they're like no man your car.

20
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:45,686
Scott: I like my car like it's.

21
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:46,550
Scott: it's kind of fast.

22
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,656
Rym: Yeah, Scott drives a normal Mazda 3.

23
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:53,914
Scott: It's nothing special 2006 Mazda 3 hatchback, and I'm like it's got like 150 horsepower whatever.

24
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:59,882
Scott: these guys are driving like a late 90s Lumina and You know they were like oh something something.

25
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:01,288
Scott: I'm like all right.

26
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,438
Scott: They're like how much that cost you.

27
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,764
Scott: I'm like 19 something.

28
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:05,950
Scott: they're like that's not bad.

29
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:07,696
Scott: I'm like that's all right.

30
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,080
Scott: It's a good car.

31
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:14,360
Scott: They're like hey those taillights So those a custom job like no it came like that.

32
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,826
Scott: I didn't change anything on this car.

33
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:19,244
Scott: the guys like whoa You must race that thing huh?

34
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:21,135
Scott: I'm like Not really.

35
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:22,741
Scott: I drive to the train station.

36
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,310
Rym: has this guy never driven on a freeway?

37
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,001
Rym: There's like millions of Mazda 3s everywhere.

38
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:29,809
Rym: There's like 12 in the parking lot of my work.

39
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:31,153
Scott: Man.

40
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:36,690
Scott: if there were wannabe racers or whatever I have no idea, but they were okay guys.

41
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:48,618
Scott: But I just thought it was kind of weird that I'm just sitting there with my car Filling it with gas a perfectly normal car in every way and some guys think it's like an awesome rice rocket Somewhat ill-informed I guess about the world.

42
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:50,665
Scott: uh at least about cars.

43
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:51,427
Scott: speaking

44
00:02:51,448 --> 00:03:11,890
Rym: about cars I'm running into this issue more and more, but a lot of times because I work in Yonkers usually I drive down to a bunch of places to eat or sometimes I walk, but one of the places I go to is next to a grocery store and a bank and Because it's during the day the only people who are ever at that grocery store or bank are old retired people.

45
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:21,710
Rym: And I have never ever driven to this parking lot Without running afoul of old people who can't drive causing all sorts of havoc.

46
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:27,449
Rym: And today was perhaps the most egregious of them all I'm pulling in and I'm in.

47
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:34,449
Rym: there Was this woman who looks like she's about a hundred thousand years old in this gigantic white SUV, and I'm

48
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:35,594
Scott: wow So

49
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:39,036
Rym: I'm waiting and she's like pulling up slowly And it looks like she's gonna pull into the bank,

50
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:39,739
Scott: and then

51
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,906
Rym: she just stops in the middle of the road Parks her car gets out and goes into the bank door.

52
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:53,437
Rym: open car Just sitting in the middle of the road blocking it not even just like in her lane But in the middle of the road.

53
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:54,500
Scott: I just stole in the car.

54
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,126
Scott: I would have gotten into it.

55
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,110
Rym: She took the keys with her.

56
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:03,110
Rym: She let the door open not all the way open But the door just kind of hanging open and the cars just stopped there.

57
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:04,549
Rym: And she goes into the bank.

58
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:09,950
Scott: I would have held the horn down and not let go of it or I would have called the police and said tow this car.

59
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:14,484
Rym: See I cared so little I just parked and got my feet.

60
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,648
Scott: so you were able to park.

61
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,173
Rym: well I just went around her.

62
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:19,082
Rym: I'm not I can maneuver my car.

63
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:21,070
Scott: Oh, you know the streets over there usually narrow.

64
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:22,868
Scott: So I was thinking maybe you wouldn't be able to get around.

65
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,410
Scott: no No, I could definitely get a white SUV in the middle of the road.

66
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,277
Rym: No if I couldn't have gotten around.

67
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:29,826
Rym: I would have been on the phone with the police before you could blink.

68
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:30,689
Scott: okay, okay?

69
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,987
Scott: I just had the picture of the couldn't get around in my mind.

70
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:47,510
Rym: now Not that I mean I don't know what to do about this issue because people just because someone's old they still have a right to get around But at the same time they shouldn't be piloting large dangerous vehicles if they don't have the mental capacity well to properly.

71
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,544
Scott: I think that no one should be piloting large vehicles in less.

72
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,090
Scott: they can prove they have a need for them.

73
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:53,953
Scott: You know it's like.

74
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:55,861
Scott: you know sure any vehicle.

75
00:04:55,881 --> 00:05:03,470
Scott: you have a right to buy a vehicle But you shouldn't be allowed to drive it in New York City unless you're filling it with people and stuff.

76
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:04,554
Scott: You know it's like.

77
00:05:04,574 --> 00:05:05,236
Rym: what about freedom.

78
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,149
Scott: Yeah, there is a freedom, but you're hurting others, and that's your man.

79
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:10,709
Rym: What if you drive it very well?

80
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,890
Scott: You make it difficult for others to drive because they can't fucking see around your vehicle.

81
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,789
Rym: But then all delivery trucks and everything are just as bad in fact worse.

82
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:21,077
Scott: Yeah, maybe they should deliver something besides.

83
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:28,510
Rym: honestly people who complain about not being able to see around or past SUVs is kind of lame and really I often have that problem.

84
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:34,620
Scott: I'll be like at a stoplight and like I'll have those SUVs in front of me I basically just can't see anything enough to trust.

85
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:37,588
Scott: you know wait for the SUV to get out of the way And then I can resume driving.

86
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:39,977
Rym: Uh-huh, I've never had that problem.

87
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:47,990
Scott: I've had that problem quite often all right all right or like I'll be trying to turn right and an SUV will be in the left next to me trying to turn left.

88
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:52,267
Scott: So I got a look to the left to see if there's a car coming before.

89
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:55,109
Scott: I could turn right But I can't see because the SUVs in the way.

90
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,970
Rym: But the SUV doesn't really block your vision much more than a minivan or a jeep or even a lot of sedans.

91
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:01,814
Scott: I don't know it.

92
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:05,874
Scott: just every time it happens where I can't see it happens to be an SUV I don't know.

93
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:09,610
Scott: I'm telling you a Corvette couldn't possibly block my vision anyway.

94
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,290
Rym: I'm just more of the mind that people who can't pilot vehicles properly shouldn't be able to pilot them.

95
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:28,110
Rym: That's also true because also at my work very recently it was yesterday, but I didn't talk about it yesterday There was a gigantic accident like gigantic And they're like four fire trucks and all these ambulances and it totally blocked the road near the sawmill.

96
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:38,310
Rym: And it's at this big intersection, but if you look at the intersection There is absolutely no way you could hit anyone there unless you were a complete and total jackass.

97
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:40,078
Scott: Well you ran the red light or something.

98
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:52,709
Rym: now you running the red light cuz people run the red light anyway You'd have had to come up to the pre-existing red light Somehow without anyone being in front of you or been sitting at the red light and then suddenly decided to just gun it.

99
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:55,730
Rym: That's the only way there could have been an accident.

100
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:01,770
Rym: There's no way to hit anything there all right, and the thing is there's accidents there about every couple weeks.

101
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:10,923
Scott: Yeah, this is why I don't drive in the city And it's also why I don't drive in Florida because Florida is pretty much the worst place to drive in the world.

102
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,610
Scott: the roads in Florida are actually nice.

103
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,195
Scott: they're really long they have a whole shit ton of lanes and The blocks are.

104
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:19,870
Scott: they're big and wide and it's all a grid.

105
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:31,669
Scott: But there's so many old people on the roads that it's just the most dangerous roads in the universe Despite the fact that if there were only people who could drive on those roads They'd be the safest roads in the universe.

106
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:39,390
Scott: They're the best roads and the best cars and the worst drivers And it's more dangerous than New York City, which is perhaps the most dangerous roads.

107
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:44,266
Rym: I mean the thing is the only roads that are really dangerous in New York City are the commuter roads.

108
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:50,369
Rym: during the commuter times Every other time it's just slow or there's traffic or whatever, but it's not like people are dying.

109
00:07:50,389 --> 00:08:01,335
Scott: no No, but I'm saying like the roads in the city like are far narrower And there's a lot more traffic going on a lot more opportunities for like you know all sorts of fender-bendering And all that kind of.

110
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,422
Rym: yeah, but at the same time.

111
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:11,610
Rym: It's just generally a very Unique experience driving in the city often because you pretty much have to do What's right as opposed to what the law says yeah?

112
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,570
Rym: And there's a lot of times where not only should you run the red light not only are you expected to run the red light?

113
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,990
Rym: But the cop who's behind you will force you to run the red light just because you're in his way.

114
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:22,904
Rym: Yeah, I have that happened to be once.

115
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:28,290
Scott: yep But yeah If we took the Florida drivers and put them on the city and we took the city drivers and put them in, Florida.

116
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:31,870
Scott: There wouldn't be any accidents in Florida and all the old people would die.

117
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:34,000
Rym: Florida roads aren't really so great.

118
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:35,950
Scott: They're really awesome.

119
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,669
Scott: They're big straight wide roads with a million lanes, and there's nothing wrong with them.

120
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,070
Rym: Yeah, big creative awesome roads with a million lanes are actually generally pretty bad and inefficient.

121
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,558
Rym: I read a cool article about it hub.

122
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:59,510
Rym: once you get beyond a two or three lane road Those extra lanes cause a lot more problems than they solve and the the extra lanes would be much better served instead of having those By just having other roads elsewhere or more efficient roads.

123
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:02,181
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing for doesn't have too many roads.

124
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,145
Scott: totals generally like these.

125
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:13,987
Scott: be it's like a grid but the grid is like these giant blocks and the giant blocks are just filled with a zillion condos and then like you turn off The giant road into the condo place, and then it's just.

126
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:20,270
Rym: everyone I know in Florida says it's actually generally hard to get anywhere And it's kind of a pain in the ass even without the traffic just the roads.

127
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:23,928
Scott: I think it's mostly the old people that make driving in Florida.

128
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:29,912
Rym: besides We can't complain about anywhere because we have driven to New Jersey perhaps the worst place in the world to drive other than I don't Know India.

129
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:33,350
Scott: yeah, we saw that there are more old people in a jersey that already are.

130
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:36,720
Rym: They wouldn't be able to find their way to the Garden State, so it wouldn't matter.

131
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,989
Rym: I guess all right, so what do you got?

132
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:42,020
Scott: All right in the news now.

133
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,930
Scott: We've been talking about this Obama guy.

134
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:44,956
Scott: You probably heard of him.

135
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:49,556
Scott: if even if you're not from the u.s.. He's running for president Or he's gonna try to run for president.

136
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:54,010
Scott: He's seeking the Democratic nomination and such when's the election next year?

137
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,730
Scott: I think right yeah, and you know I was kind of lukewarm on all the candidates.

138
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,223
Scott: I was a little up on Obama over other people because he seemed cool.

139
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:03,407
Scott: He had a podcast.

140
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:07,862
Scott: he You know he's very anti-corruption, which I agree with.

141
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,085
Scott: I didn't agree with everything.

142
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,530
Scott: He's got, but I don't agree with anything.

143
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,315
Rym: Oh, what do you disagree with?

144
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:13,679
Rym: I don't know oh?

145
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:17,911
Scott: Huh, but I'm pretty sure I don't agree with them 100%.

146
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:20,278
Scott: Uh-huh, I don't think with anyone on your percent.

147
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:20,900
Rym: all right.

148
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:25,092
Scott: There's no way because I'm sure he doesn't say Obama.

149
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:28,562
Rym: stand on gun control Scott I Don't know.

150
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,633
Rym: how does he stand on technology issues like net neutrality?

151
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:32,757
Scott: I have no idea.

152
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:35,829
Rym: uh-huh Where does he stand on freedom of speech issues?

153
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,736
Scott: I'm pretty sure he likes the freedom of speech.

154
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:39,965
Scott: uh-huh It doesn't really matter.

155
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:47,495
Scott: point is I was kind of lukewarm mostly cuz you know Rym just pointed out I don't really pay that much attention, so I'm lukewarm and anything see.

156
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:54,200
Rym: I unlike Scott I actually pay a lot of attention to politics and now that I listen to it's all politics from NPR News.

157
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:56,305
Rym: They talk a good game.

158
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:57,950
Rym: They talk about politics the way football.

159
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,953
Rym: people talk about football.

160
00:10:59,294 --> 00:11:02,711
Scott: Yeah, I just don't care, but now Obama has done something.

161
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:07,649
Scott: he has done something that Basically negates anything else he has ever done.

162
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,672
Rym: He is proven.

163
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:10,720
Rym: It doesn't matter what his stance is it doesn't matter.

164
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:20,020
Scott: Obama could turn could say tomorrow that he thinks that we should kill all the Jews Go start war with the rest of the entire world nuke everybody.

165
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,060
Scott: He could say all those things and I would still vote for him because of what he has just done.

166
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:34,057
Scott: He has said that he thinks that The presidential debates should be licensed with the Creative Commons license.

167
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,171
Scott: now Not only is that an obvious thing that should be.

168
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:39,060
Scott: I mean obviously you know they don't.

169
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:42,700
Scott: Of course the kind of thing should be done with the Creative Commons license.

170
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:46,700
Scott: It's obvious, but the point is he is proven.

171
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,110
Scott: He knows what a Creative Commons license is.

172
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,329
Rym: see even if he had said nothing should be out on the Creative Commons He said those two words.

173
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:01,773
Rym: those two words probably mean Nothing to anyone else in the United States government at all.

174
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:15,046
Scott: you say those words, and they say what yeah And if you've read sanctuary, you'll know the problem is old Circle old people who don't understand What's going on in the world.

175
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:21,299
Scott: and Obama regardless of his stance if he knows the Creative Commons is he Understands what's going on in the world?

176
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:21,982
Scott: He's.

177
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:26,280
Scott: he knows he's not one of these clueless old people who thinks is a series of tubes.

178
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:38,259
Scott: He knows the Creative Commons and therefore even if he thinks we should Do crazy stuff and that the death penalty if you robbed the convenience store I'll still vote for him because he knows.

179
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:41,892
Rym: See the thing is there is the chance that he does this.

180
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:44,240
Rym: pipe fries an aide who was like you should do a podcast.

181
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:47,033
Rym: Maybe he didn't know what one was and they convinced him to do it.

182
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:52,280
Rym: and now they're like hey Say the words Creative Commons the next time you talk and you get all the nerds to vote for you.

183
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,692
Scott: I'm gonna read exactly what he said.

184
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:54,459
Scott: sure all right.

185
00:12:54,922 --> 00:13:01,720
Scott: I am a strong believer in the importance of copyright especially in a digital age But there is no reason this particular class of content needs the protection.

186
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,587
Scott: We have incentive enough to debate.

187
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,520
Scott: the networks have incentive enough to broadcast these debates.

188
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:19,914
Scott: Rather than restricting the product of those debates We should instead make sure that our democracy and citizens have the chance to benefit from them all in way Benefit from them in all the ways that technology makes possible your presidential campaign.

189
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:23,665
Scott: use the internet to break new ground and citizen Political participation.

190
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:27,798
Scott: I would urge you to take the lead again by continuing to support this important medium.

191
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:28,540
Scott: blah blah blah blah blah.

192
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:29,859
Scott: So there you go.

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,979
Rym: Well, I think it's safe to say because even if this is just all his aides and advisors telling him this stuff Doesn't matter because they're the ones influencing him.

194
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:43,200
Scott: Yeah, it's a letter that he sent to the DNC asking them to license the debates under Creative Commons attribution license.

195
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:55,420
Rym: Yeah, it's still too far out for us to do anything But we definitely here at GeekNights take the stand that the media I mean back in the day newspapers and news stations Whatever would always endorse candidates, and they'd be straight-up partisan.

196
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,978
Rym: We the people of this chronicled of Gotham say that Joey Jojo Shabbat ooh should be the president.

197
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:02,640
Scott: It's a waste name.

198
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:11,920
Rym: I have a high Joey Jojo and We're pretty much real close to just saying we're gonna endorse Barack.

199
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:19,400
Scott: Hey, I mean yeah, okay, I endorse spitzer for less we did and he's anti-video game.

200
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,470
Rym: Yeah, that didn't come out as much until after we endorsed him.

201
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,457
Rym: in fact we considered revoking our endorsement.

202
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:26,006
Rym: not that it matters That matters.

203
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:26,832
Scott: he won 70% of the votes.

204
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:29,304
Scott: Yeah, that's course.

205
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:34,260
Rym: now because of him our friends who work for the government can't surf the web at work anymore.

206
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:42,693
Scott: Well, you know what while our friends it sucks for them I support not having government workers waste time browsing the web.

207
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:57,340
Rym: that shouldn't be so that's good Alright, so in semi related news, and I bring this up only because I didn't see anything else worth talking about and the two other Stories I'm thinking about talking about I have to verify because they seem a little dubious.

208
00:14:57,468 --> 00:14:58,503
Scott: Yeah There were some news.

209
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:00,591
Scott: is that we can't 100% verify?

210
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:03,080
Scott: like if these are real news is wouldn't they be in real?

211
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:11,967
Scott: Newspapers like from the town or state that these events happened in and we looked at the newspapers from those towns and states and did Not find these news's therefore.

212
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,893
Scott: We're pretty sure it's just a bunch of hokey.

213
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:20,214
Scott: and yet again the Unscrupulous video game media has fallen for some bullshit rumors.

214
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:24,851
Scott: ah video game media Yeah, why don't you try verifying that shit next time?

215
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:27,060
Rym: just related to all this Barack?

216
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:33,700
Rym: Additionally it's always Barack is Currently according to the news being placed under protective Secret Service.

217
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:35,366
Rym: Well, I guess protection.

218
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:38,397
Scott: so he's got the the men in black following him around.

219
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,280
Scott: make sure he doesn't get killed.

220
00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:49,083
Rym: Yeah, now apparently as his campaign has gone on he's been receiving Ever-increasing amounts of hate mail death threats all sorts of things like that I expected.

221
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:59,064
Rym: the government must just feel that he is a serious candidate who has a very good chance of Winning because they're putting him under Secret Service protection at this early stage Which isn't that uncommon.

222
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:05,000
Rym: the Secret Service will often start protecting potential candidates for the presidency long before the election.

223
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,687
Scott: Yep, also think about this right.

224
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,594
Scott: imagine if Barack was assassinated today.

225
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:11,737
Scott: Just imagine if it happened.

226
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:12,699
Scott: right just you know.

227
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:14,839
Rym: pretend I'd lose all faith in American government.

228
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:15,259
Scott: well No, no.

229
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,831
Scott: But but think about what kind of craziness would happen because of that.

230
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:19,513
Scott: like.

231
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,920
Scott: how crazy would there be a whole mess of people?

232
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,580
Scott: Who would just go nuts like there might even be like riots in many places?

233
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,640
Scott: Therefore regardless of whether he is going to they think he's likely to win the presidency.

234
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:38,867
Scott: They protect him for the security of the country because he is someone who if killed would There would be riots.

235
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:40,736
Scott: so they're gonna make sure he doesn't die.

236
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:50,300
Rym: most definitely I find it funny that at the end of the article I looked at it just notes that Hillary Clinton because she's the former first lady already has Secret Service protection.

237
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:52,489
Rym: Huh, it's like they're trying to.

238
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,253
Rym: you know there.

239
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,400
Rym: Obama was in the news.

240
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,717
Rym: We got to make sure Hiller is in the news a little bit, too.

241
00:16:57,362 --> 00:17:07,099
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I was like a senator Which they both are and I wouldn't have the Secret Service protection all the time And I probably wouldn't be a super important senator, so they probably wouldn't force it on me.

242
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:13,540
Scott: But I might from time to time say hey Can you send me some guys to make sure I don't get you know beat up over here alright?

243
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:21,508
Rym: things of the day

244
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:35,890
Scott: Alright, so well you probably don't know this because you're probably some sort of geek who doesn't pay attention to what's going on in The world, but there is a huge fight You know like the fight of the year, and it's this Saturday May 5th probably on pay-per-view.

245
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,579
Scott: But I don't recommend paying for pay-per-view.

246
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,570
Scott: go to like some sports bar if you really want to see it.

247
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:48,800
Scott: But it's Oscar De La Hoya verse some pretty guy Floyd Mayweather who doesn't look like he's ever had a fight in his life Which means he must be pretty good, so he's like Vega.

248
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,832
Scott: He sort of looks like like a Vega.

249
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:56,149
Scott: I guess yeah, but anyway and in the forum people have been discussing you know the MMA.

250
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:59,465
Scott: You know which is the mixed martial arts sort of fighting like.

251
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:03,170
Scott: you know the pride In the k1 and all that sort of crazy stuff.

252
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:04,073
Scott: You know and it.

253
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:05,780
Scott: you know it came down to the old.

254
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,310
Scott: well is the problem with you know?

255
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,550
Scott: martial arts for entertainment value.

256
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:29,383
Scott: The most entertaining martial arts are the kind with lots of punches and kicks and jump kicks and maneuvers and possibly weapons and all That sort of stuff, but when it comes to actual hand-to-hand fighting with no weapons and no magical powers of Hadouken's or anything like that The guy who's gonna win most of the time is a guy like Zangief.

257
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,790
Scott: It just grabs you and doesn't let you move.

258
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:41,006
Scott: That's why if you watch like a street fight 90% of the time it ends up on the ground because the more realistic a fight is the more boring it is.

259
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:48,536
Scott: and that reminded me that my favorite form of fighting for entertainment other than the barge is Plain old boxing.

260
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:55,423
Scott: because whether you've actually ever watched plain old boxing You know or you just don't seem to care about it because it's not that popular.

261
00:18:55,463 --> 00:18:59,649
Scott: unless there's like a giant fight going on It's actually pretty good.

262
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:05,070
Scott: And there's a reason that guys like Muhammad Ali are so famous, and you're probably geeks.

263
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,130
Scott: You might not even ever even seen Muhammad Ali fight in your life.

264
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:15,043
Scott: You might know the name Muhammad Ali and that he's some great boxer of all time Float like a butterfly sting like a bee.

265
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:16,390
Scott: yeah, you might know all the stuff.

266
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:23,775
Scott: You might have heard of Rocky also, but Rocky was a fictional character, but you might never ever watched Muhammad Ali actually fight someone.

267
00:19:23,815 --> 00:19:23,996
Scott: well.

268
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:32,750
Scott: Here's a video of Muhammad Ali versus Brian London in 1966. now you know the video starts with the Hamel Ali dancing around the guy.

269
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,685
Scott: You know punch here punch there, and then you know as he gets the guy into the corner.

270
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:39,390
Scott: Just watch what he does.

271
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,337
Scott: It's it's absolutely amazing.

272
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,541
Scott: It's like holy shit.

273
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:44,984
Scott: look how many punches.

274
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:45,486
Scott: He throws.

275
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:46,889
Scott: It's like fucking Kenshiro.

276
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:56,469
Scott: It's like It's almost inhuman like the the level the quickness and the number and the force of the punches that this guy throws.

277
00:19:56,489 --> 00:20:04,070
Scott: and Whether you care about boxing or even if you detest all violence think boxing is a barbaric thing that should never be watched.

278
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:09,930
Scott: Look at this and maybe you'll have some respect for amazing people with amazing talents.

279
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:30,210
Rym: Well right along those lines since Scott was doing a boxing thing and I didn't say anything particularly interesting on the internet I remembered that when I was a kid I would go to see hockey games in Detroit, and there was this statue Near the Joe Louis arena, which was basically a gigantic fist Hanging from some kind of triangle structure.

280
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:32,659
Rym: It was in fact titled the fist.

281
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:35,850
Rym: the fist is no other than the fist of Joe Louis.

282
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:38,227
Scott: It actually take his fist and model it.

283
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:42,549
Rym: you know I don't actually know any of the history of it other than that it is supposed to be Joe Louis's fist.

284
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:44,497
Scott: I'm gonna look this up right now.

285
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:51,901
Rym: Yeah, it's called the fist, so I'm sure you can find it anyway Joe Louis is also one of those famous boxing names you probably hear.

286
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:52,984
Rym: oh, yeah, Joe Louis.

287
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:57,758
Rym: He beat that Nazi whatever and Here's a video of him beating that Nazi.

288
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,690
Rym: the guy wasn't actually a Nazi the guy he fought Max Schmeling.

289
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,095
Rym: he was just a German.

290
00:21:02,436 --> 00:21:09,848
Rym: who was he had to fight him to prove that yeah the master race is superior and Kind of got shown up didn't look too good.

291
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:18,910
Scott: All right, so you might remember last week We said hey listeners give us some ideas for Thursday shows cuz we don't have so many now.

292
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:20,369
Scott: I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you.

293
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:27,795
Scott: We asked for show ideas for shows quite a bit and we receive not a whole lot But plenty of show ideas.

294
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:32,429
Scott: the thing is we just veto the vast majority of those ideas.

295
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,436
Rym: well It's usually a pocket veto.

296
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:36,403
Rym: We just ignore them, and then they disappear.

297
00:21:36,704 --> 00:21:37,969
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much what it is.

298
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:38,933
Scott: It's.

299
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:42,490
Scott: it's not because we think the ideas are bad even though some of them are bad.

300
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:50,414
Scott: It's usually because we say either We can't talk about this for more than you know 25 minutes or

301
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:59,596
Rym: it'll require research and we're busy or It's an idea that we've been planning to do later once we have some factor that we haven't decided yet Or it's something

302
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:10,589
Scott: we don't know much about or something we don't care about or something we have nothing to say about or It's there's some reason that we pocket veto so many of the ideas people gave us.

303
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:17,375
Scott: well I've decided and I guess Rym has agreed that what we're gonna do is We asked for ideas.

304
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:20,448
Scott: it would be kind of assholish of us to just not go with those ideas.

305
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:30,810
Scott: also It would be much more difficult for us to sit around coming up with a new idea and a lot more time-consuming Then to just go with some idea that someone sent us for better or for worse.

306
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,749
Scott: Oh, that's another reason we used to veto ideas because we didn't think that they would be entertaining shows.

307
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:44,315
Scott: well We're just gonna follow your ideas and do exactly what you say and if it doesn't turn out good You asked for it You got it.

308
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:46,262
Rym: I don't think it'll be an issue.

309
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,249
Scott: I don't think it'll be such an issue.

310
00:22:48,309 --> 00:23:01,745
Scott: also I think it'll be good for us to do shows on topics or things that other people have chosen sort of forcing us to Do some work and not just go along our usual course of thinking.

311
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:08,610
Rym: so of course the email We pick is one that only asks about us, so we don't have to do any prior planning or research whatsoever.

312
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:10,917
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I think it'll still be interesting.

313
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:13,846
Scott: all right this email is from Christian.

314
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:15,230
Scott: his name is Christian.

315
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,186
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's a guy.

316
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:20,889
Scott: He I don't know if he is a Christian, but that that's not a problem doesn't matter.

317
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:22,817
Rym: Okay, all right.

318
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:24,083
Rym: That was some pretty lame banter.

319
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:24,504
Rym: Yeah.

320
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:25,870
Rym: Yeah, that was really bad.

321
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:33,470
Rym: That was like the guy running the bingo event says something after he calls the number like b2 a bomber.

322
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:36,076
Scott: You just did all right.

323
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:37,259
Scott: so his emails.

324
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,550
Rym: really short so and grammatically incorrect.

325
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:42,156
Scott: It's very grammatically incorrect.

326
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:42,758
Scott: shame on you.

327
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:44,103
Rym: I don't see any punctuation.

328
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:44,746
Rym: I'm sorry dude.

329
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:45,910
Scott: I see some hyphens.

330
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,793
Scott: I see a question mark.

331
00:23:46,854 --> 00:23:49,323
Scott: I see a comma another comma a slash.

332
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:50,266
Scott: There's no period.

333
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:53,144
Rym: oh there is a question mark But it's after a space kind of by itself.

334
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:53,910
Scott: There's an apostrophe.

335
00:23:54,393 --> 00:24:03,090
Rym: I'll also point out and I find this funny that one Most of the emails we get are people sending them to us from work But more importantly this particular one.

336
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:10,577
Rym: I just want to note that the disclaimer that your work puts on the end of your email is Far longer than the email you sent.

337
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,945
Scott: I guess that's why we picked this one.

338
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:13,727
Scott: It's nice and sure.

339
00:24:13,747 --> 00:24:19,541
Scott: of course I don't think our discussion That will take up the whole show will be as short as the email itself.

340
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,930
Scott: all right, so let me read this email.

341
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:32,387
Scott: There's only one sentence in the email before the actual questions, and he says Okay the topic of the email is an easy slash lazy Thursday episode.

342
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:42,238
Scott: Oh good Appreciate you may not know the answers to the following comma, but you could do a running dialogue slash argument haha.

343
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,496
Rym: on your views on the following the Alright, I don't think we need to read them.

344
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:49,308
Rym: I think we'll just go through all right the future of GeekNights.

345
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:49,770
Scott: see

346
00:24:50,133 --> 00:25:11,910
Rym: We've been talking about that a lot lately Internal to our little geek enclave here partly because a few weeks ago Scott comes to me all high and mighty and starts talking about how we need to do something That's never been done with audio before and transcend podcasting and become something Beyond on a fundamental level anything that has ever been done before with audio.

347
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:18,450
Rym: Yeah, and I said Scott that silly audio by itself is pretty well understood.

348
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:23,979
Scott: Yeah the technology is understood, but in terms of the art That's what I'm talking about.

349
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:30,047
Scott: you know like you can go You can watch actually have any idea at all any because I'm not an artist.

350
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:36,513
Rym: It's like so I don't know that's like going to an athlete and saying yeah, just uh run Faster.

351
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:38,560
Scott: that's exactly what I basically said.

352
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,128
Rym: yes, not even that it's like transcend running.

353
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:41,910
Rym: Why are you running?

354
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,329
Rym: There's got to be a better way.

355
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:49,130
Scott: Yeah, and I don't know the better way, but I look at other mediums of artwork.

356
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:56,810
Scott: You know you look at movies right and there are just some movies that are sort of above and Beyond all other movies in.

357
00:25:57,717 --> 00:26:04,226
Scott: Just you watch them And you get this feeling that nothing else gives you like you watch a citizen cane or a godfather.

358
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:05,430
Scott: see but something like that.

359
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:11,010
Rym: That's just a very well done movie a very well done podcast or a very well done radio show.

360
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:12,235
Scott: But it's not like.

361
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:15,730
Scott: it's just giving me the same feeling other movies give only better.

362
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,899
Scott: It's like on a completely other level.

363
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:24,383
Scott: You know it's like on the same level like you know Mona Lisa Compared to all the other paintings or David compared to all the other sculptures.

364
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:25,949
Scott: You know it's just.

365
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:26,310
Rym: I don't know.

366
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:33,755
Rym: I don't feel that I just it's a lot better very well executed very well done, but it's not Transcendent.

367
00:26:33,796 --> 00:26:35,550
Scott: oh, it's like I read a will Eisner comic.

368
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,745
Scott: It's just so far above and Beyond every other comic like.

369
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:39,810
Scott: they can't even come close.

370
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:42,081
Rym: Yeah, but it's still just a comic.

371
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:43,950
Rym: It's like we're still just doing audio.

372
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:47,281
Rym: What what would you do with audio other than have a better show.

373
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:47,963
Rym: because the thing is.

374
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:52,790
Rym: the only reason I nitpick on Scott Here is that he brings this up alright alright.

375
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,936
Rym: So how are we going to do that?

376
00:26:55,037 --> 00:26:59,610
Scott: if I knew that answer would I still be here or would I be a world famous?

377
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,149
Scott: Radio artist that would be but remembered in history books for centuries.

378
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:14,290
Rym: obviously The key component of something like that is that it is executed very well, so I say all right Why don't we put some effort into executing GeekNights better?

379
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,773
Rym: Let's listen to old shows.

380
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:17,880
Rym: do some criticism look at them.

381
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:24,846
Rym: fiddle with the audio fiddle with our format a little bit fiddle with our Pre-production and Scott basically said nah not gonna do any of that.

382
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:28,304
Scott: yeah Thus I don't have time for that shit.

383
00:27:28,686 --> 00:27:31,516
Scott: Oh, oh Well somehow, I don't think that it's.

384
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:35,070
Scott: you know small stuff like that is what I'm thinking about.

385
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,423
Rym: But your small stuff like that David is just a very well sculpted thing.

386
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:43,756
Rym: it took a lot of practice a lot of planning a Lot of skill and it's not.

387
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:47,870
Rym: it's not transcendent or special in any way other than it was very well executed.

388
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:49,236
Scott: I don't know.

389
00:27:49,277 --> 00:27:49,377
Rym: Well.

390
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:50,565
Rym: How is it transcendent?

391
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:51,250
Rym: How is it different?

392
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,390
Scott: I don't know, but I'm sure if I went to art school.

393
00:27:53,470 --> 00:28:05,450
Rym: I could come back and tell you see I don't think you can and I really think it's funny because usually this kind of argument Is the other way around but you're just full of self-history and rhetoric and little else at this point perhaps.

394
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:08,080
Scott: But you know it's sort of like I can.

395
00:28:08,662 --> 00:28:10,429
Scott: I know something when I see it like.

396
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:19,718
Scott: I know I don't know shit about boxing But I just told you and I know watching it that that was an amazing piece of boxing by Muhammad Ali right there But I couldn't do it.

397
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,569
Scott: I couldn't tell anyone how to do it.

398
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,295
Rym: Do you really know?

399
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:23,705
Rym: or do you know because someone told you no?

400
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,395
Scott: You can.

401
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:30,581
Scott: you can tell by looking at it because it's just so amazing That you had to be an idiot not to see it.

402
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:38,346
Scott: you watch that and you just go whoa Holy shit, so I want people listening to GeekNights to go like they put their headphones on.

403
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:41,054
Scott: they should go whoa Holy shit.

404
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:41,799
Scott: the same way.

405
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,629
Scott: I do when I watch Muhammad Ali.

406
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:47,679
Rym: There's nothing different you can do with audio.

407
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:51,110
Rym: the only thing different we could do is be technically better.

408
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:55,660
Scott: Somehow I think there are ways to improve the show besides technical superior.

409
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:04,550
Rym: well you realize technical technically better includes format Editing pacing all the elements that come together to make the show.

410
00:29:05,132 --> 00:29:06,959
Rym: So I really don't see where you're going with this.

411
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:11,597
Scott: if I did no one saw Muhammad Ali doing that before.

412
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:11,999
Scott: he did.

413
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:12,501
Scott: you know it.

414
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:19,490
Scott: you have to be yeah one thing to say man I'm gonna be like the greatest ever and then it's another thing to actually be able to be the greatest ever.

415
00:29:19,631 --> 00:29:20,134
Scott: I don't think.

416
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:24,698
Scott: I don't really think we are capable of being the greatest ever But I want to.

417
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:27,429
Rym: but all we would have to do is be better.

418
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:31,130
Scott: It's so much better that it's unbelievable.

419
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:33,073
Rym: No I think it's just Incrementally better.

420
00:29:33,153 --> 00:29:47,930
Rym: and there it's you little steps little steps little steps and then you see the one at the top and you don't see Or you're not paying attention to or you don't know enough about the history of the medium or the boxing or whatever To have seen or know about all of those steps it took to get them up to the Muhammad Ali.

421
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,465
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

422
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:53,069
Scott: Regardless anyway the future of GeekNights.

423
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,879
Rym: See we think about this kind of random.

424
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:58,270
Rym: Well usually I bring it up and then Scott poo poos it or whatever.

425
00:29:58,371 --> 00:29:59,528
Rym: Let's just do the show and go to bed.

426
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:10,290
Scott: Most because that's the thing is if the show was sort of weekly or bi-weekly or something like that We could do a lot more thinking about the show and a lot more doing stuff outside the show.

427
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,942
Scott: But but that's not what people want.

428
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:12,889
Scott: That's not what they want now.

429
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:28,990
Scott: So we do it every night and as a result thinking about the future and all sorts of long-term planning and doing things for the show outside of the show itself all by the wayside in Place of doing the actual show every night and then going to bed because I'm tired and I have a job.

430
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:43,408
Rym: Well in terms of the show itself I I can say with confidence and we've said this pretty much from the very beginning that We'll probably keep doing GeekNights for a very long time regardless of whatever else we do and GeekNights will always be free No matter what else we do.

431
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:50,143
Rym: So even if we make money off of other things we go into radio or we quit and no matter what We'll always keep doing GeekNights.

432
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:54,429
Rym: worst case We might cut back a few days at GeekNights or something like that.

433
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:57,802
Rym: But I see us continuing to do the show for many years to come.

434
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:09,650
Scott: Yeah, they'll definitely be at least Probably at the bare minimum two more years of GeekNights Probably more but definitely at least two because we renewed the lease for two which means we're living here for two more years.

435
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:11,177
Scott: We're living here.

436
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:12,969
Scott: it might as well keep making the show.

437
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:19,747
Rym: Well, if you decide as people keep listening if you decide to move away You'll just have to Skype into my podcast or something.

438
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:20,169
Scott: I don't know.

439
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,910
Rym: Well, that's pretty much what'll have to happen because I'm the only one who knows how to do the audio.

440
00:31:24,512 --> 00:31:25,555
Scott: Yeah, it's not too hard.

441
00:31:26,238 --> 00:31:26,940
Rym: Oh, then why don't?

442
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:28,826
Rym: why don't you do the post process?

443
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:29,810
Scott: I go to bed instead.

444
00:31:30,452 --> 00:31:36,950
Scott: uh-huh, uh-huh, so Yeah, GeekNights will definitely be around for a while.

445
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:42,010
Scott: The show might change the format might change a lot of things about it might change.

446
00:31:42,331 --> 00:31:56,053
Scott: Well exist in some form for a time to come and even if we both quit Entirely and we give up on the whole thing and we never speak to each other again or something The show will still be up on the internet for as long as the internet exists and humans Or even

447
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:58,283
Rym: for as long as one of us continues to pay for lips.

448
00:31:58,404 --> 00:32:04,689
Scott: I'll pretty much pay for that forever Yeah, and like cost so little yeah, as long as human society doesn't crumble or anything like that.

449
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:07,497
Scott: The show will still be there for all time.

450
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:12,150
Scott: All right next what you'll be doing in one year two years, etc.

451
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:17,805
Rym: Uh, see that's really kind of an interesting question, but not interesting in any.

452
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:19,390
Rym: I don't know where I was going with that.

453
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:21,098
Rym: Yeah, I was just kind of rambling.

454
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,290
Scott: Well, I thought well I just got a new job.

455
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:27,170
Rym: I'm trying to get promoted in my job or I'll quit and get a job elsewhere.

456
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:31,830
Scott: Yeah, so I'm pretty likely to keep this job for at least one or two more years.

457
00:32:32,272 --> 00:32:36,090
Scott: You know, it's much better than my previous job, which I kept for about almost two years.

458
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,378
Scott: I think so a better job.

459
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,707
Scott: I'll probably gonna keep for an even longer amount of time than that.

460
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:41,590
Scott: I could imagine.

461
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:45,240
Scott: But that being said in the long run.

462
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,183
Scott: I don't know.

463
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:48,170
Scott: I kind of want to do something awesome.

464
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,446
Scott: We keep coming up with crazy ideas like hey, let's make this kind of business.

465
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:54,641
Scott: Let's make that kind of business Let's run away to Europe.

466
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:55,570
Scott: Let's do something.

467
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:59,487
Rym: The thing is of all of our crazy ideas GeekNights is the first one.

468
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:02,880
Rym: we actually said Alright, let's actually do well other than take over the anime club.

469
00:33:03,061 --> 00:33:04,526
Rym: Yeah, which also succeeded.

470
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:05,510
Rym: but then GeekNights.

471
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,895
Rym: Alright, let's just do a podcast.

472
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:13,589
Rym: every other ideas been just shit talking but every time we do one of our ideas They're always very successful in pretty short order.

473
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:18,466
Rym: The problem is all the ideas that make us money require us to already have money.

474
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:22,269
Rym: and if we already had money We wouldn't bother with the idea because we'd have the money already.

475
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:33,070
Rym: Yep, so if I had the money to open that I don't know the hundreds of really good business ideas We have I would use that money to live an awesome life and not bother with the stupid business.

476
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:36,062
Scott: Exactly, but yeah in one or two years.

477
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:47,750
Scott: I see myself still working still Go and do in the podcast still geeking out all the time Still going to conventions and still doing all the stuff and doing now only more.

478
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:50,070
Scott: Maybe I'll go on some awesome vacations.

479
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:52,761
Rym: That seems to be the trend in our lives pretty much right.

480
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:55,915
Rym: since we got out of college every year We constantly.

481
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:57,643
Rym: we keep doing the same things.

482
00:33:57,723 --> 00:34:04,370
Rym: We keep living the same basic lives But we keep seeking out more of what we've got we making more money doing more things.

483
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:12,076
Rym: It's like we keep expanding in every direction as fast as we can while still having the nine-to-five Baseline job that provides us income.

484
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:19,790
Rym: So despite the fact that we're pretty big risk takers a lot of the time We're really not taking any financial risks at all in our lives.

485
00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:22,784
Rym: Yeah, and I don't know if there'd be a point at which we would.

486
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:25,510
Rym: I don't know if we would ever Stake all our money on something.

487
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,119
Scott: I don't know if I'd stake all my money.

488
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:34,665
Scott: but in five to ten years when you know My car is paid off and my student is time to buy a new car and my student loan is paid off It's time to go back to school.

489
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:39,489
Scott: No, when all those things are sort of taken care of I don't know what I'm gonna do.

490
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:49,168
Rym: I might do something weird see but the thing is by then it's too late because all of history shows us that if you want To do something you got to start right away and just do it.

491
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:57,375
Rym: And if you wait until it's a better time or I have the resources now or I've done all that other stuff or now I finally out of debt.

492
00:34:57,415 --> 00:34:58,339
Rym: I have a steady job.

493
00:34:58,399 --> 00:34:59,222
Rym: I have enough money.

494
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:00,426
Rym: It never happens.

495
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,012
Rym: Then you end up being 45.

496
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:05,223
Rym: You did nothing with your life except work at a company you hated for 40 years.

497
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:06,729
Rym: Well, I guess not 40 years.

498
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,497
Scott: That's definitely not gonna happen.

499
00:35:08,517 --> 00:35:11,230
Scott: I'm definitely gonna make some sort of move before I'm 30.

500
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,154
Scott: I can guarantee that.

501
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:28,606
Rym: see the thing is pretty much the last three or four years and the next three or four years in general We're pretty much seriously consolidating all of our wealth and consolidating all of our skills and all of our friends and Bit by bit making moves toward just banding together and doing something awesome.

502
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:29,087
Scott: Yep.

503
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:30,754
Scott: All right What do you think?

504
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:33,907
Scott: the show will be like hyphen same format slash?

505
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:34,570
Rym: I don't know.

506
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,490
Rym: I don't see the format of the show changing very much.

507
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,496
Rym: Well, everyone likes it.

508
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,162
Rym: We had someone steal the format.

509
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:41,969
Rym: Well not steal but ask us if they could use it.

510
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:50,606
Scott: Yeah, I mean the format is sort of become like Like an old pair of shoes, you know, it's all it's broken in it fits.

511
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:51,610
Scott: It's comfortable.

512
00:35:52,312 --> 00:35:57,950
Scott: The thing is, you know, and I don't see myself changing it because it's comfortable and I'm lazy.

513
00:35:58,512 --> 00:35:59,956
Scott: But I do see us.

514
00:36:00,136 --> 00:36:04,128
Scott: we decided we're gonna try to you know experiment outside of the show itself.

515
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:05,255
Rym: Well, yeah We'll get.

516
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:06,689
Rym: we'll talk about that at the end of this.

517
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:11,466
Scott: Yeah, so GeekNights itself the format may or may not change.

518
00:36:11,526 --> 00:36:21,644
Scott: if you know things happen Like let's say, you know things the day dry up for some reason or you know We decide to do more of something or we come up with something new.

519
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:23,370
Scott: That's like just crazy popular.

520
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:32,829
Rym: or well one long-term format change which would probably come about if we got stupidly popular like if we hit the 50 to 100 thousand listener mark.

521
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:40,450
Rym: Then I could see just for the fact of expedience of the things we'd have to be doing and at that time It would be a full-time job and those sorts of things.

522
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:47,410
Rym: I could see the four nights of GeekNights always existing and yet it wouldn't always be just myself and Scott.

523
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:58,489
Rym: Yeah, like I could see it'd be like syndication or internal kind of like Mondays with Scott and Alex and Tuesdays with Rimming Scott and Wednesdays with blah blah blah something like that.

524
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:12,576
Scott: Yeah, because if the show is just that big and we're just doing it crazily which I don't see happening But if it does then it's gonna be sort of too big for two people to sit down and do the show Four nights a week plus.

525
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:13,839
Rym: at that point we'd have to expand.

526
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:21,928
Rym: we'd have to definitely have more shows more topics more things Which there'd probably be a whole cluster of GeekNights that would probably be every day.

527
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:22,430
Rym: at that point

528
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:37,210
Scott: I imagine we would go with the you know The whole front row cruise studios and we would produce many things and only one of those things the flagship would be GeekNights and We would make many other things that would be produced by the same studio that aren't GeekNights.

529
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:49,050
Rym: Yep, because that is one of the reasons a lot of people actually ask or at least you probably wonder how come GeekNights is At www.frontrowcrew.com and we've talked about the origin of the front row crew.

530
00:37:49,130 --> 00:38:02,590
Rym: That's basically the catch-all name for the group of people We have surrounded ourselves with who we I mean we say we're friends But we're really more like family as a group and a lot of people external to us have pointed this out to us.

531
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:13,979
Rym: Yeah, yeah, that's how it is and we generally put all our stakes together and we generally are all together on any venture and I see us collectivizing more and more as time goes on creatively.

532
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,481
Scott: Yep.

533
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:17,068
Scott: So that's the reason it's frontrowcrew.com.

534
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:19,234
Scott: and Yeah, all right.

535
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:22,994
Scott: So if you just move on, okay, all right I didn't.

536
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,201
Rym: I think there could be a more.

537
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:25,810
Rym: see we're talking about show format.

538
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,197
Rym: I think you could have handled all the segues a better way.

539
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:29,401
Rym: Yeah, perhaps.

540
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:32,610
Scott: Yeah, so this show will be like in terms of format.

541
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:34,123
Scott: There'll be better segues in the future.

542
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:41,310
Scott: Ah And not the kind where you stand on the stick with two wheels and roll around town with Steve Wozniak.

543
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,780
Rym: No, so so the next one I'll use Scott segue here.

544
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:47,066
Rym: Where will your career be?

545
00:38:47,086 --> 00:38:48,410
Scott: Well, there was one before that.

546
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:49,293
Rym: Oh was there?

547
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,906
Rym: Oh, oh, I totally missed that and we're not gonna edit that out either.

548
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:53,348
Rym: Yeah.

549
00:38:53,388 --> 00:39:01,981
Rym: Good job I'm actually a lot of people ask me about how we edit the show and that sort of thing And in fact, I do give props to anime pulse.

550
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:06,942
Rym: after we kind of reamed them on the show The Ichigo guy actually came to me was like, so how do I edit?

551
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:08,890
Rym: How do I do all these things you're talking about?

552
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:14,190
Rym: Yeah, I'm actually writing a not I wouldn't call it a book cuz it's not gonna be that long.

553
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,348
Rym: It'll probably be about 30 to 50 pages at most be like a PDF.

554
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:25,037
Rym: Yeah I'm writing a guide on how to podcast that I'm probably going to publish under the Creative Commons and probably actually Published too because it wouldn't cost that much.

555
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:25,478
Rym: Yeah.

556
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,252
Scott: Yeah, it's just you know, type it in with like a delay tech or the PDF Or something.

557
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:36,810
Rym: Yeah, I posted the barest barest like alpha alpha crap-o version in the forums But it's got a long way to go and I'm working out whenever I have time.

558
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:45,339
Scott: Yeah, I always give respect because quite often, you know, if I see someone doing something that's not so smart I'll go to them over like hey, why don't you do it this better way?

559
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:55,670
Scott: and you'd be surprised how often people say Asshole know it all don't be you know, treating me like an idiot blabbity blah and I'm like just trying to help you out.

560
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:58,535
Scott: It's like what the hell's your problem.

561
00:39:59,056 --> 00:40:03,570
Scott: so when someone says, oh, you know something I don't know please share your knowledge.

562
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,674
Scott: I wish to be enlightened.

563
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:10,053
Scott: They are someone I can respect and it's like ah, I made fun of you and you say All right How can I do better?

564
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,458
Scott: then you get the thumbs up.

565
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:19,499
Rym: but despite all the talk I gave people on how to edit in terms of GeekNights we actually Edit almost nothing out of the show.

566
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,965
Rym: The only thing that is ever edited out of a show is Occasionally we'll stop talking for some reason and I just cut that out.

567
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:30,924
Rym: But even that's pretty rare and I shortened silences between words with the filters.

568
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:33,139
Rym: I don't even it's totally automatic I don't have to do anything.

569
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:40,610
Rym: and other than that The show is pretty much recorded live and it's very rare that anything more than a second or two is ever cut out of the show.

570
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:41,011
Scott: Yep.

571
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:41,714
Scott: All right.

572
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:46,590
Scott: So the next one your plans to break into mainstream media question mark.

573
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:53,949
Rym: Well, I think we would handle that more along because it's really a two-part question in terms of before We can get to mainstream media.

574
00:40:54,352 --> 00:41:04,150
Rym: We need to break out completely among nerds and geeks Because I mean you all obviously like the show and we gained an average of I think one point six new listeners per day.

575
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,122
Rym: Every can't figure that out.

576
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:07,410
Rym: I figured that out a long time ago.

577
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,595
Rym: I think it's actually gone up since then.

578
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:15,004
Rym: All right, but literally like every single day we get new listeners and obviously everyone who listen seems to like us.

579
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:17,558
Rym: and Despite we never really advertise.

580
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:20,049
Rym: We never really do anything other than the show.

581
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:21,753
Scott: We promoted conventions but that's it

582
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:34,377
Rym: and even then promoting at conventions is a recent thing that we didn't really do partly because we weren't sure how to go about it and we've always felt really kind of odd trying to plug ourselves to People like hey listen to this podcast.

583
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:35,480
Rym: It's on the internet.

584
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:38,970
Scott: Also, I'm not confident that the promoting ethic at the conventions works.

585
00:41:39,091 --> 00:41:41,590
Scott: I mean we gave all those CDs out of Katsucon.

586
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:43,335
Scott: How many people listen to the show now?

587
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:49,480
Scott: because the Katsucon CD if you discovered us via the Katsucon CD Please email us.

588
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:50,990
Rym: Yes, just we're curious.

589
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:58,436
Rym: This will help us out because actually I did see a spike on feed hits of fairly significant one after Katsucon But it wasn't as big as you would expect.

590
00:41:58,457 --> 00:42:01,570
Rym: but then again, we actually promoted ourselves very little at the con.

591
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:02,954
Scott: Yeah, we could have done better.

592
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:03,656
Rym: Yeah.

593
00:42:04,197 --> 00:42:08,510
Scott: So anyway, the way I see it right is that you know the mainstream media.

594
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:17,022
Scott: I'm kind if some like radio station came along and said hey Can we syndicate your show on our whatever right I'd be like.

595
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:22,949
Scott: well you can follow the Creative Commons license But since you're commercial you probably can't do that.

596
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:32,141
Scott: So if you want you will can make a deal with you and I would probably let them syndicate the show in exchange for money and I'd be more than happy to do so.

597
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:42,941
Rym: I've explored a few syndication options and it basically Comes down to the fact that terrestrial radio is right out because the FCC Yep, and we occasionally say the word fuck so they can't do that.

598
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:46,310
Rym: Fuck that then cuz we just we wouldn't censor ourselves ever.

599
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,106
Rym: Nope And I've looked into it.

600
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:54,941
Rym: It's not that far out of the realm to get syndicated on satellite radio for us Like honestly the more I've looked into it.

601
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:56,390
Rym: It's really not that far out of the realm.

602
00:42:56,801 --> 00:43:06,622
Rym: however I think that we need a little more consistency in the show before we could do that and I'm not really willing to Conform the show into that kind of format.

603
00:43:06,944 --> 00:43:08,250
Scott: Yeah, it's like the satellite radio.

604
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:19,276
Scott: your show has to be like exactly a number of seconds long and you need to put like this beeping noise like at the Ends that when you send the mp3 to the satellite radio guy He can run it through his thing.

605
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:20,721
Scott: and there's also a few.

606
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:36,030
Rym: when it comes to commercial syndication like that there are a few minor gray areas in terms of copyright because while we have permission from the author of the song we use in The beginning of the show the song is based on a commercial property and it's not a parody.

607
00:43:36,453 --> 00:43:38,510
Rym: But it's really kind of this gray area.

608
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:46,910
Rym: Yeah, and we're never will obviously never get in trouble using it as we have but if we started selling the show straight up syndicated commercially.

609
00:43:47,432 --> 00:43:55,309
Rym: There is a tiny chance of legal trouble and I haven't had a chance to have my lawyer look over it partly because that's really Not on the horizon in the next year or so.

610
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:59,019
Scott: Also, you know it says everyone seems to assume.

611
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,810
Scott: Oh you're doing this amateur deal to break into the real deal.

612
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,482
Scott: Well, you know what I say.

613
00:44:04,764 --> 00:44:05,690
Scott: this is the real deal.

614
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:22,036
Scott: It might not be the real deal right now But in the long run the new media the blogs the podcasts the webcomics The YouTube videos in the long run it's that all that stuff is going to replace the current mainstream media.

615
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:31,330
Scott: the TV the movie theater the the Newspaper all that stuff is gonna go away and all the stuff that us geeks are doing is going to be the replacement.

616
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:40,009
Scott: So we might not be the mainstream now but we're basically on the boat that is going to become the mainstream and the old Titanic is going to sink.

617
00:44:40,029 --> 00:44:44,970
Scott: and Why should we bother to jump onto the sinking boat while it's the happening place?

618
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,650
Scott: We can just wait on our nice happy boat until it becomes the happening place.

619
00:44:49,031 --> 00:44:57,136
Rym: so thus the question becomes more importantly simply your plans to break into anything to actually break out and Starting this year.

620
00:44:57,216 --> 00:45:00,130
Rym: We're really gonna start promoting ourselves, but not in the traditional way.

621
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,519
Rym: We're never gonna pay for ads or anything like that.

622
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,170
Rym: At least I don't see us doing that mostly because I'm not.

623
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:16,710
Scott: I mean mostly because I'm anti advertising and it's sort of hard to complain about ads and then buy some Even though I don't mind being hypocritical to the kind of people who would like GeekNights So the kinds of people who run ad block Yep.

624
00:45:17,212 --> 00:45:27,690
Scott: And also I am not confident that the amount of money we would have to pay to get any sort of advertising Would actually give us any sort of return in listenership that we want.

625
00:45:28,112 --> 00:45:30,910
Rym: So, I guess I'm not gonna give you our whole five-year plan.

626
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:35,041
Rym: So I got why don't call it that it'll fail.

627
00:45:35,403 --> 00:45:36,890
Rym: I got Twilight struggle on the mind.

628
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,581
Rym: Yeah yeah, but the first phase of kind of the next wave.

629
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:46,489
Rym: because if you look at our graph of listenership we have Surges and then plateaus.

630
00:45:46,671 --> 00:45:54,262
Rym: It's always surge plateau search plateau and every surge is after we figure something out or we do something different Usually with how people find out about us.

631
00:45:54,745 --> 00:46:04,670
Rym: and this time around We're really starting to break out into the anime and gaming Convention circuit and not in the old way where we just put flyers around and we did like one panel on.

632
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:09,043
Rym: This is how to do a podcast on the internet at Sunday morning.

633
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,450
Rym: And now we're doing like ConnectiCon.

634
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:22,109
Rym: We're gonna run like eight or nine events there and this all stems back to ConnectiCon last year where we had You know, we were walking around and promoting ourselves made flyers and it wasn't really working.

635
00:46:22,611 --> 00:46:25,240
Rym: So eventually we basically stole someone's artist alley table.

636
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:26,284
Scott: Well, it's good.

637
00:46:26,364 --> 00:46:28,974
Scott: It wasn't really stealing an empty one It was we knew the person.

638
00:46:29,215 --> 00:46:30,119
Scott: Yes, it was cool.

639
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,445
Rym: We still stole it from them.

640
00:46:31,485 --> 00:46:32,670
Rym: But yes, not that they were using it.

641
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:33,224
Scott: No, they weren't.

642
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:41,096
Rym: So we're sitting there and we're just talking like we do on the show because he realized that we have conversations like this Regardless of whether or not anyone's here.

643
00:46:41,357 --> 00:46:41,538
Rym: Yep.

644
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:45,070
Rym: We're just angled a little more toward each other instead of toward you.

645
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:53,530
Scott: But if there's a third person toward you who's not here toward you who is a metal stick that cost about $80.

646
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:57,687
Rym: But we gave up on trying to promote our show and no one wanted our stupid little flyer.

647
00:46:57,707 --> 00:46:58,370
Rym: no one cared.

648
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:02,209
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I go to conventions people give me flyers I throw them out.

649
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:09,665
Rym: Usually I get the big pile and I sit it on my desk and I think all right once I get free time I'm gonna go through all these because I obviously picked him up for a reason doesn't happen.

650
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:12,000
Rym: and then a month later I see this pile of papers.

651
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:12,584
Rym: What's that?

652
00:47:12,684 --> 00:47:13,188
Rym: I throw it away.

653
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:18,250
Scott: Yep I mean once I was given a CD in our to Sally Otakon and I actually put it in my computer.

654
00:47:18,611 --> 00:47:25,709
Scott: The thing is the CD was done in such a way that I couldn't actually explore the content on it with great ease and you know.

655
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:33,325
Scott: But I did put it in my computer when I got home and it had some flash Animations and things that they weren't so good, but I don't remember who made the thing.

656
00:47:33,365 --> 00:47:34,610
Rym: So yeah, but the idea was there.

657
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:35,897
Scott: Yeah, it was actually.

658
00:47:36,158 --> 00:47:38,270
Scott: hey, they gave me a thing and I actually checked it out.

659
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,357
Scott: Hence the audio CD at Casa con.

660
00:47:40,397 --> 00:47:44,270
Scott: and apparently people did listen to that audio CD at Casa con.

661
00:47:44,813 --> 00:47:52,710
Scott: I just don't think it translated into people subscribing to the podcast Because I've yet to see anyone say that they started listening because of the Casa con CD.

662
00:47:52,912 --> 00:48:07,129
Rym: But then again, you know the percentage rule I mean maybe a tiny percentage of the people who listen will ever bother with the forums or emailing us or anything because I know how many people listen and I know how many people post in the forums and there's a big discrepancy between the two.

663
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,561
Scott: There's a lot of people sign up for the forums and ever post.

664
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:11,794
Scott: a lot of you will read the forums and they don't post Anything.

665
00:48:11,815 --> 00:48:12,523
Scott: I'm like what?

666
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:17,505
Scott: All right Listen everybody whether you're the kind of person who posts in forums or not.

667
00:48:17,545 --> 00:48:20,982
Scott: if you're just the lurking shy Nothing wrong with lurking Scott.

668
00:48:21,103 --> 00:48:25,510
Scott: I know passive Listener who just listens to the show and doesn't do anything else.

669
00:48:25,911 --> 00:48:26,553
Scott: I don't care.

670
00:48:27,095 --> 00:48:32,390
Scott: send us one email or make one post in the forums and then go back to your lurking ways.

671
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:33,999
Scott: I want to know you exist.

672
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,809
Scott: prove it to me because I don't believe it.

673
00:48:37,012 --> 00:48:43,259
Rym: Yeah for all we know we have one listener with a thousand IP addresses Yeah, and he just keeps it in the side at all of them.

674
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:48,770
Rym: All right, but Basically, we're there and we gave up on promoting.

675
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:54,030
Rym: So we're just talking to each other and we start arguing and then someone at the table next to us starts arguing with us.

676
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,830
Rym: Not an angry argument, but a friendly argument.

677
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,662
Rym: I think we were talking about video games or something

678
00:48:57,722 --> 00:48:58,306
Scott: something like that

679
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:06,829
Rym: and Two people were walking by and they stopped and they stand there kind of across the hall Just watching our little group and listening to us talk

680
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:07,451
Scott: Mm-hmm,

681
00:49:07,893 --> 00:49:25,744
Rym: and then later other people start talking and someone walks up and they start talking to us and we're like, yeah At the end of the conversation like yeah, we do a show and they're like really well I really like to listen to that and we've realized that the best way to promote ourselves is To just do the things we do and to run events and to actually do awesome things.

682
00:49:26,105 --> 00:49:33,410
Rym: and if people think that things are awesome They'll seek us out as opposed to trying to convince people that were awesome with a piece of paper that says our name on it.

683
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:39,010
Scott: Yeah, I mean tell me if I'm wrong listeners But I think the selling point of the show is our personality.

684
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:43,896
Scott: So the best way I think that we can promote the show Well, it's my personality right.

685
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:50,031
Scott: right is to put I'm not talking about personality in that sense talking about our personalities as nouns You know Not.

686
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:58,608
Scott: the right is to just put that out there for people to experience and if people like what they experience Then they will want more.

687
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:08,324
Scott: It's sort of like giving out free samples as a you know of the real deal live in person as opposed to a CD Which isn't really a free sample because the whole show is free.

688
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:09,450
Scott: Yeah, you get the idea.

689
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:11,521
Rym: Yeah, but we're starting to do this at cons.

690
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:12,486
Rym: I mean Katsucon.

691
00:50:12,788 --> 00:50:23,940
Rym: last year We've wrote I guess this past one We ran the anime match game in the smallest panel room But we filled it to overflowing and everyone there really really loved it and they even went to the con feedback and said man those Guys were awesome bring him back.

692
00:50:24,242 --> 00:50:28,350
Rym: Yeah, so next year I imagine we're gonna run a whole bunch of events and ConnectiCon there.

693
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:33,430
Rym: We're gonna run a whole bunch of events and anime next hasn't gotten back with me, but I'm working on that and Otakon.

694
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:34,769
Rym: I think we're gonna run a bunch of events.

695
00:50:35,392 --> 00:50:45,988
Scott: Yep, so you seem to be doing pretty well with the promoting at the anime and we could also do the gaming cons Even though they're less panel oriented, but well ubercon will be fine at except there was no spring ubercon this year.

696
00:50:46,008 --> 00:50:51,890
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but I think we need to need to find some way to promote more into the other geeky areas.

697
00:50:52,231 --> 00:50:53,335
Rym: Yeah, and it's tough.

698
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,383
Rym: I mean I'd go to penguin Khan every year.

699
00:50:55,484 --> 00:50:57,130
Rym: I'm sure we could rock penguin Khan.

700
00:50:57,231 --> 00:51:06,175
Rym: Oh, we could totally rock penguin But penguin Khan's in Michigan and while driving to Michigan from Rochester wasn't so bad driving there from here Really sucks.

701
00:51:06,456 --> 00:51:10,130
Scott: and all the other tech conferences are sort of not even accessible to us.

702
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:10,652
Scott: Really like.

703
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:16,916
Scott: they either cost a lot of money and they're meant for business professionals, you know on business trips and they're all useless.

704
00:51:17,057 --> 00:51:18,826
Rym: I could do a show on how stupid those things are.

705
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:29,582
Scott: yeah, and There's other kinds where it's like a bunch of hackers get together for a weekend to code something and while those have pretty cool Atmospheres, I really don't have time for that.

706
00:51:29,883 --> 00:51:31,610
Scott: You know, it's like I got to code my own stuff.

707
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:37,238
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean if we went to an event like that, we wouldn't be a Def Con or something We wouldn't be performers.

708
00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:38,889
Rym: We just be press covering it.

709
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:45,830
Rym: Yeah, and as we've learned being press at an event while interesting for us is not interesting for anyone else.

710
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:47,529
Rym: So no one has any reason to remember us.

711
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:55,019
Rym: Yeah I mean what you're gonna remember the guy who shoves a microphone in your face and ask you why you're dressed up like Sailor Moon Despite the fact that you weigh 700 pounds.

712
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:01,524
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it's definitely all about being the entertainer and not reporting on the entertainment.

713
00:52:01,865 --> 00:52:02,808
Scott: All right, let's go.

714
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,684
Scott: the next question Where your career will be?

715
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:18,147
Rym: well see in both of our job, we basically have taken turns leapfrogging each other in terms of salary and Neither one of us has ever been satisfied with a job pretty much ever.

716
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:24,670
Scott: now I mean, this is the best job maybe the best job yet and it's I can't see doing this for the rest of my life.

717
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,519
Scott: Let me just say that much plus we.

718
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,795
Rym: we constantly make less money than we should be making and every time we get a new Job, we make more money.

719
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:35,030
Scott: Yep, so we'll see where this job goes.

720
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:40,188
Scott: I mean, I've only been here a month, but you know, I'll change it eventually almost definitely.

721
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:56,790
Rym: Yep I'm actually gunning for a promotion in my job because basically the job I do While fairly technical I could teach some high school kid how to do it in like a couple days And I could make at least 20k more doing the actual network architecture stuff.

722
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,001
Rym: So I'm actually pushing to get a promotion.

723
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:00,047
Rym: if I don't get the promotion.

724
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:00,630
Rym: I might just quit.

725
00:53:00,923 --> 00:53:01,070
Rym: Yeah

726
00:53:01,451 --> 00:53:17,141
Scott: I mean ideally I would very much like to do something I wanted to do like run a computer repair shop in town or oh Be a baker or I might dream job has always been so like be the high school Computer teacher, but that is not a possible job.

727
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:19,750
Scott: It just doesn't exist and it doesn't pay enough for me to live.

728
00:53:19,971 --> 00:53:25,190
Rym: I mean even we lived in a high-paying school district like a really good school or even at a private school.

729
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:35,694
Rym: Yeah, we we'd make less money Working as a teacher like far less money than we make now doing our crap jobs for relatively little salary compared to the median in This area.

730
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:40,519
Scott: Yeah, I mean sure the teachers get summer off But even if you factor that in we'd still be making less money.

731
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:49,975
Scott: and also they won't let me be just a computer teacher And they won't let me decide the computer curriculum and they won't let me make all the important technology Decisions that I need to make.

732
00:53:50,477 --> 00:54:00,650
Scott: they're just gonna say alright you teach math for periods a day a day And then you teach one crappy computer class on these shit computers these kids who don't give a shit and it's just not worth it.

733
00:54:01,011 --> 00:54:13,491
Scott: but I know that if I was in charge of teaching computers, then that would be the best job in the world and Every kid who went to that school because it would totally be a mandatory class every freaking semester to be with me and learn about Computers.

734
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:20,690
Scott: every kid who came out of that school would be a computer master and could just go to RIT and walk get a degree in like six months.

735
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,997
Scott: So I'll know you're not six months.

736
00:54:23,037 --> 00:54:23,780
Scott: It is kind of hard.

737
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:30,190
Rym: But yeah, yeah much less than five years It seems a lot easier because we always look back on it with our current experience.

738
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:36,107
Rym: Yeah, I mean I look back on sysadmin class and I remember having so much trouble making bind work in Red Hat.

739
00:54:36,428 --> 00:54:44,670
Scott: and now The kids would be on the fast track to graduating and many of their early classes would be extremely easy pretty much our careers.

740
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:51,370
Rym: We're gonna continue to make more money and the moment we stop making more money or we have the resources do what we want to do.

741
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:54,019
Rym: We're gonna do what we want to do as soon as we can.

742
00:54:54,039 --> 00:55:03,250
Scott: Yep, and unless something crazy happens like a lottery winning or So we're discovered by someone with a lot of money who decides they want to you know invest in us.

743
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:06,304
Rym: We need the old wealthy benefactor who has millions hidden in Europe.

744
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:07,670
Scott: It's called an angel investor.

745
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,777
Scott: I think is the is the current buzzword.

746
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:10,640
Rym: Oh, whatever.

747
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:10,941
Rym: Yeah.

748
00:55:11,122 --> 00:55:21,030
Scott: Yeah, unless something crazy like that happens We're gonna keep working nine to five coming home and doing a show and having fun on the weekend until for the foreseeable future.

749
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,699
Rym: Alright, so this last one here because I just looked at the.

750
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:30,409
Rym: we've been going on this pretty long actually for an easy lazy Thursday Yeah, but Mary's easy married children, etc.

751
00:55:31,192 --> 00:55:35,389
Rym: And in parentheses this one always makes me laugh about our Rym says he will never have kids, etc.

752
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:40,766
Rym: Well, I really don't plan to have kids and I in general any time.

753
00:55:40,806 --> 00:55:42,050
Rym: I would look at it one.

754
00:55:42,191 --> 00:55:48,549
Rym: I don't even have time to take care of a dog because if I had time to take care of a dog you can bet Your ass that I would have a dog right now.

755
00:55:48,871 --> 00:55:50,698
Rym: I love dogs my whole life with dogs.

756
00:55:50,959 --> 00:55:53,710
Rym: the fact that I don't have a dog right now bothers me constantly.

757
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:58,145
Rym: Yet a kid takes slightly more effort than a dog and cost a little bit more money.

758
00:55:58,626 --> 00:55:59,650
Rym: so kids ride out.

759
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:02,061
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I don't really care about animals.

760
00:56:02,322 --> 00:56:03,809
Scott: But if I had time I'd have a fish.

761
00:56:04,174 --> 00:56:05,229
Scott: I have a little fish in a fish tank.

762
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:13,490
Scott: I don't have time for the fish in a fish tank and all you have to do is shake some food in there and clean The tank like once a month and I have time for that and I also wait to say it.

763
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:29,850
Rym: But in general having a kid would pretty much remove About 70% of the options that I have now that I want to pursue in my later life Because the amount of money and the amount of time the amount of resources I would have to spend I'm not saying I wouldn't get anything out of that.

764
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:36,810
Rym: I'm not saying people shouldn't have kids But it would definitely take away from me most of the things that I actually want to do with the rest of my youth.

765
00:56:37,251 --> 00:56:37,934
Scott: Yeah, it's like up.

766
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:39,840
Scott: Well, there goes all those conventions.

767
00:56:40,181 --> 00:56:42,650
Scott: There goes all that geekery right out the window up.

768
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,418
Scott: No more time to play Pokemon.

769
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:47,170
Rym: Yeah, if I had a feed the baby, there'd be no more GeekNights.

770
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:48,176
Rym: I can tell you that much.

771
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,705
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much a hundred percent.

772
00:56:49,765 --> 00:56:50,490
Scott: be no more sleep.

773
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:52,157
Scott: Talk about not sleeping now.

774
00:56:52,217 --> 00:56:55,430
Scott: imagine if you had a kid there'd be no sleeping at all buried.

775
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,357
Scott: Yes, I mean night screaming.

776
00:56:57,758 --> 00:57:04,217
Rym: I generally have seen that most of the people I've known who had kids I mean, they're still cool people though But they don't.

777
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:10,150
Rym: they can't run in the same Circles that we run in and I don't want to stop running in these circles at all.

778
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:13,590
Rym: And we have actually two friends who are they're getting married very soon.

779
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:18,550
Rym: We're looking forward to that, but they are planning eventually on having kids and I wish them the best of luck.

780
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:25,826
Rym: But I wonder how much they're going to be able to continue to go to anime cons And that sort of thing at least for the first several years.

781
00:57:25,846 --> 00:57:26,389
Rym: They have the kid.

782
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,360
Scott: Yeah, I mean once the kid is like, I don't know sentient.

783
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,470
Scott: Yeah, like 10 ish, you know, like later element

784
00:57:32,651 --> 00:57:41,631
Rym: It'll be awesome because Scott and I can be those crazy Uncles who teach the kid the real business about the world like the Flying Spaghetti Monster and how to hack their parents computers yep,

785
00:57:42,273 --> 00:57:52,210
Scott: but until then the kids basically just a big bucket that you have to fill with food and money and Empty out because all the food and money turns into piss and shit and vomit.

786
00:57:53,436 --> 00:58:00,476
Scott: as for me No, I mean I'm constantly looking for some woman but Yeah, fine.

787
00:58:00,516 --> 00:58:02,170
Rym: Yeah, you're looking so hard.

788
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:11,029
Scott: I know that's mostly the reason I haven't found anyone is because I spend my time doing geekery because Frankly, you know as much as I would like some sort of female companionship.

789
00:58:11,896 --> 00:58:13,289
Scott: My geekery is more important.

790
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:23,248
Scott: But that also sort of precludes female companionship because any sort of the such would Reduce the geekery which I don't want to do except it really doesn't I mean.

791
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:32,176
Rym: Everyone I've ever dated in my life has been really geeky and really into all the things I'm into and I haven't found anyone like That that I want to get with.

792
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:33,921
Scott: so that's just how it is.

793
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:39,559
Rym: also consider the fact that all the women We know are very attractive and very cool and very geeky.

794
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:43,190
Scott: Yeah, and how many of them are like potential whatnots?

795
00:58:43,531 --> 00:58:45,000
Rym: Here, I don't know what.

796
00:58:45,242 --> 00:58:46,510
Rym: I'm not gonna get into that with you.

797
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:56,390
Rym: We've had this argument offline cuz I don't embarrass anyone But I would say that a good number of the people in our extended group of friends are pretty attractive and pretty much, right?

798
00:58:57,171 --> 00:58:59,287
Rym: I don't know what your problem is with them.

799
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,520
Scott: They're all taken or I don't like them in that way.

800
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:04,403
Rym: Oh, you don't like him.

801
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:10,022
Scott: You just basically told I don't like him in that Way, ah, there's been liking someone and liking someone in that way.

802
00:59:10,163 --> 00:59:11,226
Scott: So what would it take?

803
00:59:11,246 --> 00:59:12,270
Scott: I like a lot of people.

804
00:59:12,451 --> 00:59:13,882
Rym: What would your perfect girl be?

805
00:59:14,225 --> 00:59:14,728
Scott: I don't know.

806
00:59:15,771 --> 00:59:20,430
Scott: I know it's well, you know when you see it like, you know good boxing when you see Muhammad Ali beat someone up.

807
00:59:21,112 --> 00:59:26,550
Rym: But I think we established that that doesn't end well because you can't actually ever find it or anything.

808
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:31,425
Scott: Regardless, I'm not putting that too much effort into looking even though it's something I'd like to find.

809
00:59:31,465 --> 00:59:31,706
Rym: Yeah.

810
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:32,730
Rym: Yeah, that's the excuse.

811
00:59:32,912 --> 00:59:33,601
Rym: I'm just not look.

812
00:59:33,662 --> 00:59:34,209
Scott: what is true?

813
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,419
Scott: I mean when was the last time I put any effort into looking?

814
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:38,990
Rym: but you go to all these cons and what do I do?

815
00:59:40,272 --> 00:59:44,045
Rym: Well, you could go be social and I don't do that really.

816
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:45,270
Rym: I guess you don't.

817
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:51,710
Scott: But yeah, so if I happen to find someone that'd be pretty cool getting married.

818
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:56,370
Scott: Uh, if I got married, it would be sort of like a financial decision.

819
00:59:57,431 --> 01:00:01,590
Scott: Yeah, I really have no value in the institution of marriage.

820
01:00:01,811 --> 01:00:07,150
Scott: The only value I would have is hooray we can combine our money into one bank account and pay less taxes.

821
01:00:07,819 --> 01:00:14,330
Scott: That's really, you know I mean there might be some woman that I spend the rest of my life with and love more than anyone and all that.

822
01:00:14,771 --> 01:00:19,969
Scott: But I wouldn't get married or have any sort of weird ceremonies or anything like that.

823
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:24,509
Scott: Yeah, I would just go to a courthouse and sign a paper if it was beneficial to do so.

824
01:00:25,073 --> 01:00:31,469
Rym: well, I mean Emily and I have been together for many years now and Marriage really isn't on the docket at all.

825
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:44,390
Rym: but it doesn't mean that we're in any way thinking about breaking up or anything and I foresee us being together pretty much unless something happens for the rest of our lives, but I don't Really see if we'd ever get married.

826
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:50,310
Scott: Yeah, as far as I'm concerned like if I did have a wedding it would be going on to the courthouse.

827
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:52,840
Scott: Give the judge 10 bucks sign a paper go home.

828
01:00:53,322 --> 01:00:56,556
Rym: Well, that's what my mom did when she got remarried She but they went to the courthouse.

829
01:00:56,576 --> 01:01:00,170
Rym: They had a little ceremony and then they just had a crazy barbecue party at home.

830
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:03,470
Rym: Yeah, that sounds like a plan to me with a roast pig and it was pretty awesome.

831
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:06,463
Scott: I'd probably like get a party to Dave and Busters, but that's fine, too.

832
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:10,493
Scott: You know having kids I don't know.

833
01:01:10,553 --> 01:01:24,070
Scott: see it's sort of hard because I'm sort of of the mind that like I would like to have kids you know because I imagine like having a kid and Raising him to be or him or her to be all awesome like me and then all that good stuff.

834
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:26,510
Scott: But it's like if I do it while I'm young.

835
01:01:26,952 --> 01:01:29,750
Scott: I sort of ruined my own life in a way that Rym just said.

836
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:35,570
Scott: But I don't want to be like Penn Jillette and do it when I'm old because then you sort of it sucks for the kid.

837
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:43,437
Scott: You know, he doesn't have too much time with me and almost no time with grandparents and as a recent kid I valued that time quite a bit.

838
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:54,109
Scott: So it's sort of like I can either make a kid now and make him real well or But it'll suck for me or I can make it later and it'll suck for the kid.

839
01:01:54,633 --> 01:01:56,730
Rym: Hence I decided to just not have a kid.

840
01:01:57,051 --> 01:02:08,430
Scott: So if I if I did ever make a kid on purpose it would have to be at like this exact Perfect timing like where I had lived enough of my awesomeness that I didn't need anymore.

841
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:14,250
Scott: But it was still early enough in my life where I could raise the kid well and his life wouldn't suck either.

842
01:02:14,471 --> 01:02:17,990
Scott: So you wouldn't have like a 40 year old 50 year old dad when he was like three.

843
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:32,869
Rym: I think that's one point where we're different where I don't think I would ever not continue to be ambitious Because I mean everyone knows the other person knows that I am continually and permanently ambitious and I'm always seeking more than I have.

844
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:41,821
Rym: and While I could be very happy with something Usually when it comes to you know life fortune property that sort of thing I always kind of test the waters that.

845
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:42,364
Rym: could I have more?

846
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:43,067
Rym: could I have a bigger house?

847
01:02:43,087 --> 01:02:43,750
Rym: could I have more money?

848
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:44,835
Rym: Can I travel more?

849
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:46,565
Rym: could I know anything like that?

850
01:02:46,585 --> 01:02:47,310
Rym: Can I have more power?

851
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,355
Rym: Can I get into politics?

852
01:02:48,617 --> 01:02:51,070
Rym: if I was a congressman in the House of Representatives?

853
01:02:51,472 --> 01:02:53,523
Rym: I'd be gunning for the Senate if I was in the Senate.

854
01:02:53,563 --> 01:02:54,710
Rym: I'd be gunning for the presidency.

855
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,982
Rym: Yeah, if I was the president I'd be gunning for the UN.

856
01:02:57,284 --> 01:03:00,090
Rym: if I was the head of the world I'd be gunning for Space King.

857
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:08,498
Scott: Yeah But I look and I see there are quite a few people in fact most people in positions much higher than we are Who have kids.

858
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:09,588
Scott: I mean Bill Clinton has a kid.

859
01:03:10,592 --> 01:03:13,050
Scott: Got way ahead of was in terms of ambition.

860
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:18,050
Scott: So there it is possible to have a kid and still keep the ambition going strong.

861
01:03:18,513 --> 01:03:21,129
Scott: The thing is I wondered like how did those kids turn out?

862
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,761
Scott: You know does that have a strong effect on them?

863
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:24,463
Scott: who knows well?

864
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:25,990
Rym: How much did she see her dad?

865
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,697
Rym: He was probably busy much of the time.

866
01:03:27,897 --> 01:03:30,649
Scott: Yeah, it's like do I want to have a kid if I'm not gonna see them?

867
01:03:31,671 --> 01:03:32,033
Scott: I don't know.

868
01:03:32,534 --> 01:03:36,869
Scott: those are decisions for a later time because right now there isn't even one to make a kid with.

869
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:39,516
Scott: So yeah, that's that.

870
01:03:39,877 --> 01:03:42,366
Rym: yeah, I'm definitely liking the idea of a dink.

871
01:03:43,149 --> 01:03:45,565
Rym: I remember I never realized when I was young watching Doug.

872
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:46,169
Rym: yeah, mr.

873
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:52,773
Rym: dink dink is actually one of those acronyms that came out when they're in the days when they're calling people yuppies and guppies and All those things.

874
01:03:53,295 --> 01:03:57,129
Rym: and and no we are not guppies despite the fact that we've been called such more than once.

875
01:03:58,431 --> 01:04:07,630
Rym: but dink stands for dual income no kids and Considering the fact that the household right now of Scott and I we make fairly significantly over six figures.

876
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:15,490
Rym: Yeah as a household and if Emily moves in with us We're making a fairly stupid amount of money, especially considering our expenses.

877
01:04:16,092 --> 01:04:26,426
Rym: yep, and if I think how much money my parents made if they hadn't had to deal with me or my little brother or How much money I have if I don't have to spend it on something like a kid.

878
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:30,258
Rym: Oh I'll live in relative luxury for the rest of my life.

879
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:41,921
Scott: It's especially because we're not you know, we follow that If you don't have the money don't buy anything Don't buy shit you can't afford.

880
01:04:42,122 --> 01:04:49,748
Scott: Yeah as we basically Don't bot live above our means we'd spend less than we make and we're always profiting.

881
01:04:49,809 --> 01:04:59,947
Scott: every month I look at my checking account and no matter how much nerdy shit I try to buy I try to buy more comics I try to buy more video games and at the end of the month I go Oh, man, I think about too many video games.

882
01:04:59,967 --> 01:05:04,025
Scott: this month I bought like 2ds games in a Wii game and I bought like a $200 box of comics.

883
01:05:05,371 --> 01:05:06,735
Scott: Oh, this is this is gonna hurt.

884
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:14,005
Scott: and I look and every month without fail the balance of my checking account Increases by a lot every time.

885
01:05:14,045 --> 01:05:21,350
Rym: mine's been pretty steady But I spend a lot more time and money on going out to eat and had so an entertainment and transient things.

886
01:05:22,012 --> 01:05:26,150
Scott: I do quite a bit of those things as well, but checking account just keeps going up.

887
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,374
Scott: I don't know what's going on.

888
01:05:27,615 --> 01:05:28,317
Scott: It scares me.

889
01:05:28,739 --> 01:05:30,445
Scott: But yeah kids would just ruin that.

890
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:31,950
Scott: kids would completely ruin that.

891
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,395
Scott: I'd probably go into horrible debt.

892
01:05:33,857 --> 01:05:37,810
Scott: But as long as I don't go into horrible debt as long as I stay employed.

893
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,355
Scott: We're doing alright.

894
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,041
Rym: Alright, I think we should wrap this up.

895
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:43,550
Rym: We've been talking for almost an hour just on this.

896
01:05:44,413 --> 01:05:45,919
Scott: I guess that guy sent a good email.

897
01:05:45,939 --> 01:05:57,776
Rym: I hope people actually like oh, oh, oh Basically, he said well Rym talk about yourself and talk about the awesome things you do and the awesome things you want to do That.

898
01:05:57,977 --> 01:05:59,609
Rym: how long could that possibly take?

899
01:06:00,451 --> 01:06:03,990
Scott: Well, let's see if anyone actually liked this episode or if they thought it was terrible.

900
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:09,209
Rym: Yeah it is gonna be one of those rare episodes that gets the meta tag which we used to do a lot early on.

901
01:06:09,249 --> 01:06:12,501
Rym: when we Do shows like what the fuck are we gonna do with Monday nights?

902
01:06:12,561 --> 01:06:13,785
Rym: We can't talk about science.

903
01:06:14,066 --> 01:06:17,619
Rym: We got over that pretty quick Yeah, or how are we gonna fix the show?

904
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:19,545
Rym: or these microphones suck?

905
01:06:19,606 --> 01:06:20,710
Rym: We kind of got past all that.

906
01:06:20,971 --> 01:06:28,156
Scott: Yeah, I think that's a good thing that we got past all that because those kind of shows are so The beginning Podcaster.

907
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:30,270
Rym: yeah a little hint because this is part of that book.

908
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,076
Rym: I'm writing the word before we end.

909
01:06:32,176 --> 01:06:46,287
Rym: if you're a prospective podcaster pretty much the worst thing you can do beyond You know actual bad serious problems is to constantly say the word podcast in your podcast Or to talk about your podcast in the meta a lot.

910
01:06:46,689 --> 01:06:48,034
Rym: Yep I mean a lot of people.

911
01:06:48,054 --> 01:07:01,150
Rym: they always call their show the blah blah blah podcast and if you call it that Word still stands out to a lot of people and it goes from this is just some show I'm listening to - this is a podcast those things on the internet.

912
01:07:01,735 --> 01:07:10,596
Scott: Yeah, also people, you know If you spend your entire show talking about the show the people are listening to What's your show?

913
01:07:10,918 --> 01:07:13,190
Scott: It's just something talking about itself.

914
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:14,875
Scott: It's just this inverse loop of nothing.

915
01:07:15,236 --> 01:07:21,033
Scott: your show the vast majority of your show 99% of it has to be a show About something.

916
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:25,508
Scott: if it's a video game show you shouldn't talk about the show for more than 30 seconds.

917
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:34,550
Scott: You know, no matter how I guess if your show is five minutes long You shouldn't talk about your show itself more than saying the name and then talking about video games the rest of the time.

918
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:41,449
Rym: So on that note, we'll wrap it up and remember you can save the children, but don't save the British children.

919
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:43,691
