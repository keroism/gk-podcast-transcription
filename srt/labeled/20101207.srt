1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,580
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 7th, 2010.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:10,761
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:12,970
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,376
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,710
Rym: Tonight, it's a round castle to stay alive.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:18,928
Rym: It's Rampart.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,838
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:27,475
Scott: Alright, so I work.

9
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:30,970
Scott: My office is not exactly in Times Square, but it's pretty close.

10
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:32,839
Scott: I can see Times Square from my work.

11
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:34,790
Scott: You know, the ball with the year under it and everything.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,168
Rym: Yeah, like if I worked there and it was somebody who wasn't in the city, I'd just be like, "Yeah, I work in Times

13
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:38,349
Rym: Square.".

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,250
Scott: Yeah, a tourist would consider a Times Square, and there is touristy shit up to your eyeballs.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,325
Rym: God, you're the one who posted that tourist map of New York City.

16
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:47,390
Scott: That was pretty great.

17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,750
Scott: Yeah, there's touristy shit up to your eyeballs outside my office, which is why I tend to go right into the subway and get the hot out of there.

18
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,330
Rym: See, finally, all the touristy shit near me is kind of like sequestered into specific areas.

19
00:00:58,172 --> 00:01:01,370
Rym: In Grand Central, there's that little market of ultra-expensive crap.

20
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:10,470
Scott: Yeah, immediately next to my office, there's a place that you can buy all sorts of just knick-knacks of, you know, Statue of Liberty magnets and gaudy postcards.

21
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:12,117
Rym: See, I have the more upper class.

22
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,062
Rym: It's like $4,000 henbag.

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,878
Scott: Empire State Building statues to put on your, you know, all kinds of bullshit.

24
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,930
Scott: Anyway, so most of the stuff is touristy bullshit.

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,850
Scott: For example, the M&M's store directly across from my office is the most bullshit in the world, right?

26
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:31,790
Scott: All they sell at the M&M's store, they sell M&M's at a ridiculous price by weight.

27
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,330
Scott: So you don't want to buy them there ever unless you need like a specific color mix for a special occasion.

28
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,048
Rym: Kind of like when you need Legos, you go to that Toys R Us and you're like, "I want a hundred of this

29
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:41,369
Rym: brick.".

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,410
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, even then, you could probably order that online from a special, you know, holiday place.

31
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:48,970
Scott: You don't need to go to the M&M's store for that and pay the ridiculous prices.

32
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,610
Rym: You don't need to go to a store for anything in this modern world.

33
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:59,009
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, the M&M's store is two stories tall and 90% of the stuff that they sell is not actual candy, but like stuff that looks like M&M's.

34
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,550
Rym: Stoner's Pop Palace.

35
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,910
Scott: And every single product they sell comes in a different color for each color of M&M's.

36
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,776
Scott: So, you know, it's out of control.

37
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,842
Scott: Everything is ridiculously overpriced.

38
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:10,870
Scott: It's tourist trap number one, right?

39
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,390
Scott: But across the street on the other side of the M&M's store is the Hershey store.

40
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,088
Scott: And if you look at the outside of the Hershey store, you're like, "Man, that is touristy shit right

41
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:19,309
Scott: there.".

42
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,130
Scott: But if you go in the Hershey store, it's a secret to everybody.

43
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,830
Scott: Basically, the Hershey store actually sells Hershey products.

44
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,813
Scott: Gasp, right?

45
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,050
Scott: I mean, they sell some Hershey merch, but not a lot.

46
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,050
Scott: Most of the stuff they sell there is actual chocolate or candy or something.

47
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,650
Rym: Well, as actual as Hershey's chocolate is, which is pretty good.

48
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:40,949
Scott: They also sell real chocolates.

49
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:41,586
Scott: Whoa.

50
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,543
Scott: And not everything in there is Hershey's milk chocolate.

51
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,469
Scott: They have dark chocolates and pretty much every variety is in there.

52
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,490
Rym: Except, of course, the boutique stuff like the jalapeno or whatever.

53
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,228
Scott: They got some.

54
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:55,581
Scott: Really?

55
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:58,310
Scott: Yeah, they got all kinds of crazy shit in there.

56
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,622
Scott: And the thing is, it's a really small store.

57
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:02,230
Scott: It's about the size of our apartment.

58
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,766
Scott: The outside of it looks like it's a giant store, but the inside?

59
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:05,370
Scott: Tiny store.

60
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:06,897
Scott: M&M's store is gigantic.

61
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,045
Scott: Two-story monstrosity.

62
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:08,750
Scott: This tiny store.

63
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,347
Scott: And you would think, "Alright, sure, they got all the different varieties in there, but the prices are gonna be out of

64
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:13,669
Scott: control.".

65
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,130
Scott: It's gonna be like $100 for a bar, and you might as well just go to Bodega.

66
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,032
Scott: Well, you know what?

67
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:23,370
Scott: All the prices and all the stuff, it's not a discount, but it's manufacturer retail price.

68
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:25,349
Scott: So they're not ripping you off.

69
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,301
Scott: Especially if you can get a variety there.

70
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,550
Scott: that's not at the grocery store.

71
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,405
Scott: It's worth four bucks for a bag of kisses.

72
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:33,510
Scott: That's pretty average.

73
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,830
Rym: I have to say, you did bring with you some fancy kisses.

74
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,930
Rym: The only thing, I have to find out if they have some of the weird Japanese stuff that they sell in Japan, but not here.

75
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:44,210
Scott: Yeah, they got some stuff that, you know, it changes once in a while.

76
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:46,910
Scott: You look around, it's like they have something and they don't have it.

77
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:50,830
Scott: They had dark chocolate Kit Kats, but I didn't see them the last time I was there.

78
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,690
Scott: But now they've got Reese's Pieces of peanut butter cups that are in the shape of Christmas trees that they didn't have before.

79
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,430
Rym: See, that's my biggest candy gripe, is that I can't get the green tea and the white chocolate Kit Kats.

80
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,530
Scott: I've seen white chocolate Kit Kats at least once in there.

81
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,829
Rym: I see them every now and then, and when I do, I buy them.

82
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,330
Rym: But I don't see the green tea ones, except in Seattle at PAX.

83
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,890
Scott: I don't know, I'll have to look and see if I see the green tea ones in there.

84
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,429
Scott: The Kit Kat section's pretty small, you know.

85
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,089
Scott: The kisses and hugs are really big right now in there.

86
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:19,248
Rym: Kit Kat is really the best, though.

87
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,050
Scott: Yeah, but it's like... But yeah, so it's like the opposite of tourist trapping.

88
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,883
Scott: You know what, if you go to the store between 10 and 11 AM, they're like discounts now.

89
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,986
Scott: If you go in at the right time, or like bring your receipt with you, you can get 10% off.

90
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,650
Scott: So it's like, whoa, this is actually like a legitimate place you might want to go.

91
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:44,290
Rym: So I will post-face that by saying that we were not paid in any way by anyone to say that.

92
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:51,410
Scott: It's interesting to point out, like if you're coming to the city, you know, a lot of people tourist in the city around this time, it's tourist time.

93
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,169
Rym: I feel like we should do a Thursday show on the stuff to actually see in New York City.

94
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:57,130
Rym: Okay.

95
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:58,329
Rym: I think that's a decent show.

96
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,109
Scott: It's okay.

97
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:01,530
Scott: Most of it is touristy, yeah.

98
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,250
Rym: Tourists go down to Wall Street and look at the stupid bull, but they don't know about like the High Line Park.

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,630
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you're coming to do some tourism, there are some things.

100
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:16,990
Scott: If you're the kind of person like me where you'd avoid anything that would look touristy, right, then you would probably avoid the Hershey store, but it should not be avoided.

101
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:18,570
Rym: All right.

102
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,016
Scott: All right.

103
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:32,290
Rym: So before we get onto the gaming show, I would like to make an open plea to the makers of Civilization V. Jesus Christ, can I not play your game until you fix this simultaneous turn bullshit?

104
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,910
Scott: I don't think we're going to fix that, but hopefully they'll fix something else.

105
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:36,889
Rym: But they have to fix it.

106
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,730
Scott: The game- And I mean, just the lag even, you know?

107
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,670
Scott: I mean, if you're going to have simultaneous turns, the benefit of that is that I shouldn't be waiting.

108
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,630
Scott: But I'm waiting because it's all slow.

109
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,350
Scott: It should be just as fast and responsive playing network gaming as it is playing local gaming.

110
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,530
Scott: Well, what bothers me is that- Counter-Strike doesn't have this problem.

111
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,870
Rym: Counter-Strike, which is actually- It's a real-time game.

112
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:56,128
Scott: Yeah.

113
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,210
Scott: It's a turn-based game.

114
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,670
Rym: How come the real-time game has no lag and yet the simple turn-based game has like 20 minute lag?

115
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:10,850
Scott: Because the publishers forced them to shove the game out the door real quick without spending a whole bunch of time working on getting it really polished, right?

116
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,350
Scott: And on top of that, nobody makes network code the number one priority.

117
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,808
Scott: That's like the back burner priority.

118
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,470
Scott: Right, so- But my specific complaint- Yeah, I guess World of Warcraft.

119
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,930
Rym: Is that they made the game more, quote unquote, like a board game.

120
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:36,489
Rym: Like Civ IV, you'd have big stacks of units and the fiddliness of did this one unit attack first versus this one didn't matter that much because- I had 100 spearman and you had 50, so I win.

121
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,290
Rym: Economic might would just sort that out in the end and it worked out okay.

122
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:51,005
Rym: But in this game where every individual unit's individual decisions matter greatly, much like a German-style board game, it'd be like if you were playing Puerto Rico and I just grabbed the captain first.

123
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:51,869
Rym: so I fucking get it.

124
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:52,789
Scott: Yeah.

125
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:58,070
Rym: I love Civ V, but I've gotten to the point to where I cannot play it multiplayer.

126
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:05,390
Rym: Even tiny little games between me and Scott will have a race condition where we both agree, alright, that was bullshit.

127
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,610
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you want to have simultaneous orders, right, you need to come up with a rule set to account for that.

128
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,130
Scott: For example, the famous board game Diplomacy.

129
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,330
Scott: Everyone hands in their orders and the orders resolve and it doesn't matter who handed in the order first as long as you handed it in on time.

130
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:31,110
Scott: So they actually, the game says, okay, you had an attack order from A to B and you had a support order from C to B, so therefore it comes out like this, right?

131
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,450
Scott: Civ V doesn't have that.

132
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:39,130
Scott: You know, whoever, who's the attacker and who's the defender, they still treat the combat as if it's turn-based.

133
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:45,050
Scott: But they're just sort of randomly or whoever pushed the button first gets to be the attacker.

134
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:47,030
Scott: That might make a big difference, right?

135
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,390
Scott: A lot of the units are heavily balanced towards attack or defense.

136
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,290
Scott: You know, a spearman or a pikeman is heavily defense.

137
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,890
Scott: But a horseman or an elephant is heavily offense.

138
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:06,050
Scott: So if he attacks my elephant with his elephant, right, suddenly I'm in a really bad position because I didn't push the button immediately and he pushed it a second before I did.

139
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:12,530
Rym: Now, this wouldn't bother me as much if I, you know, if it was an incompetent game company making this game.

140
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,910
Scott: No, but this has Sid Meier's name on it, he should know better.

141
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,890
Scott: Even though I know he's, you know, I don't know how much he actually works on, has his hands on the game.

142
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,550
Rym: Some crappy indie game, like Minecraft, I don't necessarily complain that sometimes I get three lava buckets.

143
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,570
Scott: Well, it's also alpha, so, you know, they can excuse that.

144
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,049
Rym: Dwarf Fortress, I complain about it, but I don't complain about the fact that my dwarf is just fucking stupid.

145
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,330
Rym: I expect him to be stupid, like that, for what that game is, I expect my dwarf to be stupid.

146
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,850
Rym: I don't expect my Civ dude to be stupid.

147
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:44,790
Scott: And the reason that bothers me specifically is that- And that game costs a lot of money compared to these other indie indie games.

148
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:57,530
Rym: Is that it took me, and Scott, and pretty much everyone else we know who cares about games, all of 30 seconds to come up with explicit, specific, and exact ways to mitigate this problem that could have been trivially implemented.

149
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,618
Rym: I mean, why do you even have the option?

150
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,710
Rym: Some people don't care about the simultaneous play, so whatever.

151
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,770
Rym: Have the fully simultaneous mode where it's just bullshit if you get close to people.

152
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,010
Rym: Then have the, you know, breakout to turn-based mode where it breaks out to explicit turns.

153
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,130
Scott: We're gonna have to check and see if this is one of the things, 'cause Civ V, part of it is editable.

154
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,601
Scott: There's a lot of Python scripts in there.

155
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:19,610
Scott: I mean, Civ IV had that.

156
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:21,249
Rym: I don't think this is editable.

157
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:28,390
Scott: I'm gonna see if this is a thing that can be fixed by the user, and the thing is, will it carry over to multiplayer, you know, that we can play over Steam?

158
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:31,550
Rym: Well, considering the multiplayer game is basically a different game.

159
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,051
Scott: Yeah.

160
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:37,670
Scott: We're gonna have to see if we can edit this, and if we can edit it, if it actually works and is fixable.

161
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:38,109
Scott: I don't know.

162
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:39,179
Rym: Come on, guys.

163
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:40,006
Scott: Seriously?

164
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,190
Rym: I mean, I can understand when you have a problem with the game, but this isn't even like a bug.

165
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,342
Rym: This is your designed functionality.

166
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:49,370
Rym: that was just poorly thought out.

167
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,137
Scott: I have a solution.

168
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:50,461
Scott: You ready?

169
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:51,310
Scott: You want my solution?

170
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:53,129
Rym: We just play board games?

171
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:53,491
Scott: No, no.

172
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:55,121
Scott: Civilization VI, but you know what?

173
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,590
Scott: We're gonna change something about Civ VI.

174
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,930
Scott: It's not gonna be Sid Meier's Civilization VI.

175
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,508
Rym: Scott Rubins?

176
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,082
Scott: It's gonna be Rainer Canizio's Civilization VI.

177
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,289
Scott: That will solve all problems.

178
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,490
Rym: Careful, it might be a Tower of Babel situation.

179
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,346
Scott: Actually, a Rainer Canizio, Sid Meier, Alpha Centauri II.

180
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:10,989
Scott: How about that?

181
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:11,710
Rym: Ah.

182
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:16,810
Rym: Alpha Centauri had the best weapons of mass destruction of games like that.

183
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,531
Scott: Yeah.

184
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,959
Scott: Anyway.

185
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:20,970
Scott: So, let's see what's going on in the gaming world.

186
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,090
Scott: Oh, I got something really tiny just to mention, right?

187
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,796
Scott: It was a long time ago.

188
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:27,081
Scott: August of 2009.

189
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:29,730
Scott: I preordered on Amazon, right?

190
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:30,630
Rym: Scott waited.

191
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:31,761
Scott: Golden Sun DS.

192
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,494
Scott: And it's shipping.

193
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:35,077
Scott: I saw it.

194
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,970
Scott: I was waiting in a Best Buy just to kill time yesterday.

195
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,930
Scott: And Golden Sun DS was on the shelf there and Amazon shipped it to me.

196
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,941
Scott: And it's in Kentucky.

197
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:43,589
Scott: It's on its way.

198
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:47,331
Scott: And it is currently December of 2010.

199
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:50,085
Scott: So, I waited a year and four months.

200
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:51,638
Rym: A year.

201
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:52,109
Rym: Scott?

202
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:53,570
Rym: Duke Nukem Forever.

203
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,690
Rym: When was Team Fortress 2 announced?

204
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,633
Scott: I'm just saying.

205
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,270
Scott: You know, this took a long time for this fucking game to come out.

206
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:01,808
Scott: Demo video of Team Fortress 2 like five years ago.

207
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:02,833
Scott: But you know what?

208
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:06,270
Scott: The thing was is I preordered it in August of 2009.

209
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:13,431
Scott: I think Nintendo, if I recall correctly, I'm pretty sure they announced it and demoed it at like E3 of 2009.

210
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:14,384
Scott: So, that's like, "Ooh.

211
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:14,830
Scott: Ooh.".

212
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,403
Scott: So, you want to know what's wrong with Nintendo.

213
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:17,129
Scott: That sort of thing.

214
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,517
Rym: Well, never mind.

215
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:19,630
Rym: You know, where's my Advance Wars?

216
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,070
Rym: Where's another Advance Wars?

217
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,010
Scott: Why don't they just take every game that they put out in Japan and put it out here?

218
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,650
Scott: They've already made the goddamn games.

219
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:29,832
Scott: Mother 3.

220
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,690
Rym: Well, look at the Advance Wars situation.

221
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,370
Rym: Because the original, you know, when they released Advance Wars on the Game Boy Advance.

222
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,829
Scott: All the other Advance Wars games.

223
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,110
Rym: But when they released it, it was considered a big gamble.

224
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,410
Rym: And it was pretty much expected to fail.

225
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,225
Rym: They're like, "Americans won't play a turn-based

226
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:43,528
Rym: game.".

227
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,793
Scott: Yeah, explain to me this.

228
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:49,730
Scott: Why did they bring Starfy over, but they don't bring Mother 3 or all the other Advance Wars games?

229
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,070
Rym: I think they expected that Starfy would capture the young girl demographic and the casual gamer demographic.

230
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,492
Scott: Oh, yeah.

231
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:57,030
Scott: I'm sure Starfy did so well.

232
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,419
Rym: Look at what they did with Advance Wars.

233
00:11:58,439 --> 00:11:59,849
Rym: They had these Advance Wars games coming over.

234
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,049
Scott: They're getting it right with Layton and Phoenix Wright.

235
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,087
Rym: And the Advance Wars games were cute and puzzle-y.

236
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,410
Rym: And then they tried to make it hardcore.

237
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,970
Rym: Like, remember the most recent Advance Wars?

238
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:13,330
Scott: Yeah, but they released Days of Ruin also in Japan, if I know correctly.

239
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:14,414
Rym: Yeah, they did.

240
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:20,230
Rym: What I'm saying is that when they released that game in the US, when they designed the game, it was a departure from the Advance Wars series.

241
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,470
Rym: I think it was a good departure, but they way changed the style of the game to make it dark and serious.

242
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:28,290
Rym: And there was a weird trick, and I finally kind of realized why they did this.

243
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,470
Rym: Remember how you could hit R and zoom in, which was basically the so-zoomed-in view that it was stupid?

244
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:37,350
Rym: You could see, like, two units, but when you zoom in, the units look all different.

245
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:46,290
Rym: Notice how all the promotional stuff for that game in the US only showed the zoomed-in units, because the zoomed-in units look dark and hardcore and realistic.

246
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,709
Rym: But the zoomed-out units are the cute Advance Wars icons we're used to.

247
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:57,230
Rym: I think they were very specifically trying to market that game to what they expected were the hardcore sensibilities of Western gamers.

248
00:12:57,852 --> 00:12:59,928
Scott: It's just, they're so incompetent there, right?

249
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,970
Scott: It's like, hello, the reason you already released- That was the fourth Advance Wars game to come out in the United States, right?

250
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,159
Scott: So they already released three in the United States, two for the GBA and one for the DS, and all of them did well.

251
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,029
Scott: That's why they were thinking of bringing another one.

252
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:15,770
Scott: So why did they change a formula that works?

253
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:20,170
Scott: This is, I think, the number one problem, is they changed a winning formula, right?

254
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:20,693
Scott: Zelda 1?

255
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:22,381
Scott: Oh, it's a winning formula.

256
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,010
Scott: Zelda 2, right?

257
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:28,130
Scott: Ah, but at the same time- I know you like Zelda 2, but I'm saying they changed a winning formula.

258
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,670
Scott: Metroid, Metroid, hey, Metroid?

259
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:38,230
Rym: No, no, no, Scott, you need to do both, because if you never change the existing formulas, today we'd be playing Ultra Pong Championship Edition DX 2010.

260
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,170
Scott: All right, so that's true.

261
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,210
Scott: And nothing else.

262
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:40,983
Scott: Okay, no, no, no.

263
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:49,190
Scott: See, I mean, for example, also there are some changes of formulas that work out, like look at Mario 64, which has now gone into Mario Galaxy.

264
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:51,150
Scott: Very good change of winning formula, right?

265
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,050
Scott: Metroid Prime, a very good change of winning formula from-.

266
00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:00,130
Rym: Well, all you have to do is when you make a game like that, like say you have a departure, if the core line is still going strong, keep making the core line.

267
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,790
Scott: That's what I was about to say, is if you, you know, if Mario 64 is a success, right?

268
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,370
Scott: Keep it going with the 2D Marios and the 3D Marios.

269
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,410
Scott: Don't stop the 2D Marios, right?

270
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:16,748
Scott: If the top-down Zelda's doing well, and the 3D Zelda's doing well, keep them both going.

271
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:17,450
Scott: Don't stop.

272
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,902
Rym: Of course, Scott, your argument will fall flat.

273
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:21,570
Rym: I just want to ask you one question.

274
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:28,470
Rym: Is there an Advance Wars game that came out after Days of Ruin that is not in the US, that is in Japan?

275
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,070
Scott: There are plenty of ones that came before.

276
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,150
Rym: Yeah, but the games that come before often will not sell that well.

277
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:46,170
Rym: Like the Final Fantasies, until this nostalgia trend pushed them up, if you had just released Final Fantasy II and III in like 1998, they probably wouldn't have sold at all.

278
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:55,627
Rym: People won't go back and play a shitty old game, quote-unquote, unless there's some good marketing effort behind it, or the game has suddenly become classic.

279
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:03,770
Scott: So anyway, I looked on Wikipedia, right, and there are basically three Advance Wars games that were not released in the US.

280
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,650
Scott: Famicom Wars, Game Boy Wars, and Super Famicom Wars.

281
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,860
Rym: Yeah, they're not that good.

282
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,150
Rym: There's no reason to bring them out.

283
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,827
Scott: They could make a compilation of them.

284
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:14,790
Scott: Put them at least on the WiiWare/virtual console.

285
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:21,110
Rym: See, my complaint isn't, it's not like they're making new Advance Wars games, they're not bringing them over, they're just not making Advance Wars games at all.

286
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:22,569
Scott: They gotta make a new one.

287
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:23,067
Scott: I know.

288
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,510
Scott: They're making a new Golden Sun.

289
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:27,230
Scott: Actually, they're done anyway.

290
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,930
Rym: Because Advance Wars has captured my gaming cock more so than any other game has in recent memory.

291
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,350
Scott: Will Wright's as well, apparently.

292
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,330
Rym: Yeah, I was very happy when he said that.

293
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,590
Rym: It vindicated the fact that to this day, I'm trying to get an S on the last three maps in DR.

294
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:44,530
Scott: Yeah, I think I'm gonna go all S on Pac-Man CEDX.

295
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,389
Scott: If you're not playing Pac-Man CEDX, you suck.

296
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:47,741
Rym: I got a lot of A's.

297
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:48,388
Rym: I don't have any S's.

298
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,507
Scott: I got a lot of S's.

299
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,850
Rym: Of course, I haven't been playing that much.

300
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:53,310
Rym: But, I do want to talk about this briefly.

301
00:15:53,390 --> 00:16:02,050
Rym: There was an article from, actually today, claiming that gamers are abandoning DS and PSP games in favor of smartphones.

302
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,449
Rym: They have some data to back this up.

303
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:11,190
Rym: But basically, they've said that sales on the DS and the PSP have fallen 13%, and sales of games on smartphones have gone way, way, way, way, way up.

304
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,750
Rym: And they're predicting this huge sea change.

305
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,290
Rym: They're predicting the PSP2 is gonna be dead on arrival, effectively, which, probably.

306
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:30,070
Rym: But, I think what's actually going on here, and I do believe there is a kind of trend away from the DS PSP, the traditional console, like handheld console.

307
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,130
Rym: But I don't think it's a sea change.

308
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:37,350
Rym: I think consoles like the DS have started capturing this so-called casual gamer market.

309
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,230
Rym: And those people didn't have any options before.

310
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,907
Rym: They're like, "Ooh, I want to play these silly little

311
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:42,129
Rym: games."

312
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,270
Rym: And they got a DS because it was cheap.

313
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:45,309
Rym: Everyone has a smartphone now.

314
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:52,910
Rym: Those people aren't even going to bother buying a DS or buying a game or anything, when cheap, crappy, like one-off games are a dollar on their iPhone.

315
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:53,855
Scott: That is true.

316
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,010
Scott: I mean, I can think there's a bunch of factors, right?

317
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:58,290
Scott: The one you pointed out, I definitely agree with.

318
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,706
Scott: I definitely agree that there's a problem when I can get Choo-Choo Rocket on my iPhone for a dollar, but $30 on the DS.

319
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:12,109
Rym: There's the fact that there's been a relatively small number of compelling games on handheld consoles in the last year?

320
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,676
Scott: That's another thing I was gonna bring up, is that the number of games for the handheld that are like, "Oh man, I gotta get that,"?

321
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,490
Scott: not too many of them, right?

322
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:29,274
Scott: You know, the ones I can think of right away are like, there was a... That's kind of old, right?

323
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:36,410
Scott: There was the Miles Edgeworth game, there was a new Layton game, and the Golden Sun DS, and Dragon Quest IX, a lot of people are on that, you know?

324
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,319
Rym: Yeah, but how few is that?

325
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:38,458
Rym: Four.

326
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,490
Scott: Meanwhile, on the iPhone, there's like a zillion games, and they're all like a dollar or three dollars.

327
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,050
Rym: We're definitely very choosy in the games we play, so let's say we expand that.

328
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,790
Rym: Triple that number, assuming there's a bunch of games we don't care about that other people care about.

329
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,389
Rym: That's still a tiny number of releases.

330
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,650
Scott: Yeah, that are worth playing.

331
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,810
Scott: And I think the other thing is, telling you from my personal experience, that someone has an iPhone and a DS, right?

332
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:01,467
Scott: My DS was stolen, and I was thinking, "Should I really replace

333
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:01,568
Scott: it?".

334
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,966
Scott: And the thing is, I replaced it because I got a piracy card, right?

335
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:18,570
Scott: It wouldn't be worth it without one of those, because there's a bunch of games that are sort of like, I would maybe kind of want to try them out, don't really want to finish them on the DS, that really aren't worth paying full price for.

336
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:22,190
Scott: Notice I did pay full price for Golden Sun, which is totally, you know, that's my game.

337
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,150
Scott: But I play games on the DS and the iPhone, and really, it's changed.

338
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,170
Scott: I used to bring the DS all the way around with me when I had a regular phone, and I'd play that all the time.

339
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:37,310
Scott: But now, if I'm on the subway, I'm playing some stupid games on the phone.

340
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:38,869
Scott: I'm not bringing the DS with me.

341
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:41,850
Scott: The DS, I mostly use that for playing in bed.

342
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:46,190
Scott: I use the DS the same time that I would read a book or read a comic book.

343
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:48,120
Rym: Remember back when we had the long commutes?

344
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,130
Rym: Like, my DS was my primary console.

345
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,210
Rym: I would come home, sit down, and just play my DS for a couple hours.

346
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,150
Scott: Back in those days, I would do the same exact thing.

347
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,390
Scott: But nowadays, the DS, I'm not really using it portably that much.

348
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:06,550
Scott: I mean, the portability factor is basically, ah, I can play this on the couch or in bed, as opposed to sitting up at the desk.

349
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,694
Rym: Now, I do have a different situation.

350
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:11,950
Rym: My commute is so short, I don't have any incentive to play phone games or anything.

351
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:13,910
Scott: The thing is, my commute is so short.

352
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:20,250
Scott: But even just standing on the subway platform for five minutes, there are games that are that small that I play.

353
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,322
Rym: Yeah, I listen to music or I read.

354
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:23,670
Rym: I just do other things.

355
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:38,690
Rym: But what's interesting here is that I think all these predictions of a sea change, what's really going on, and we talked about this at PAX in all of our panels, is that people keep saying the market is moving toward casual games and phones and simple games.

356
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:52,210
Rym: I really think that the majority of those people were not gamers in the sense that there is one demographic of gamers that will always want to play so-called hardcore real games.

357
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:58,250
Rym: And all these people are newcomers who really, what they're playing don't compete with the other games.

358
00:19:58,691 --> 00:20:00,469
Rym: They're two completely separate markets.

359
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,690
Rym: People might cross over between one or the other, but most of this competition, I think, is false.

360
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:14,109
Rym: No one's really moving to the iPhone saying, "I'm going to buy all my games on the iPhone now," because there aren't that many good games on the iPhone.

361
00:20:14,752 --> 00:20:17,341
Scott: No, no one's moving to the iPhone for games.

362
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,669
Scott: They have an iPhone and they get games.

363
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:27,770
Scott: People had cell phones before, regular phones, and even on the shittiest phone you can get, you can buy Tetris on there for a couple bucks.

364
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,437
Scott: So people go, "Ooh,

365
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:28,822
Scott: Tetris.".

366
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:30,949
Scott: But this is starting to be a big problem.

367
00:20:31,492 --> 00:20:39,301
Rym: And that pundits and industry analysts and game designers are looking at all these numbers and saying, "Yeah, there's like 20 billion people playing social games.

368
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,145
Rym: We've got to get on that shit.

369
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:40,788
Rym: That's the future of

370
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:41,130
Rym: gaming.".

371
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:54,750
Scott: Well, the reason that there's that perception is if you're a game development company, you make games, you say, "Huh, I could make big expensive games and then try to get lucky and sell enough copies to make a profit, which potentially could be big, but probably not.

372
00:20:55,111 --> 00:21:03,889
Scott: Or with the same exact people at this company and the same exact talent and equipment, the resources that I have, I could devote these resources to making tiny shit games and make more

373
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,090
Scott: money.".

374
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:12,030
Scott: So it's basically a diversion of resources on the developer level and the publisher level that is moving from one to the other.

375
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,810
Scott: In all other ways, there isn't a connection.

376
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,974
Rym: Let me analogize this.

377
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:17,563
Rym: This would be like a guy who owns a McDonald's, let's just say.

378
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:20,878
Rym: He owns a McDonald's.

379
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:21,685
Rym: That's his franchise.

380
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:22,190
Rym: It makes money.

381
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,230
Rym: He's looking at it and he sees a pita pit next door.

382
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,497
Rym: He's like, "Man, pita pit's where the money's at.

383
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:30,767
Rym: I should turn my McDonald's into a pita pit because competition,

384
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:31,128
Rym: whatever.".

385
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:35,346
Rym: Or, "Yeah, that car dealership makes way more money than my McDonald's.

386
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:35,969
Rym: I should do that

387
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:36,230
Rym: instead.".

388
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:43,659
Scott: Well, the difference is the resources a McDonald's has, you can't just change the sign outside of McDonald's and suddenly it becomes a pita pit.

389
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,860
Scott: You need completely different equipment in the kitchen, completely different new training of the employees.

390
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:49,066
Scott: You need all this stuff.

391
00:21:50,373 --> 00:22:03,480
Scott: But if you have people who know how to program games and computers, you can divert those resources to a lot of different ends without really having to do a whole lot of work other than saying, "Stop making the big fancy PS3 game.

392
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,165
Scott: Make Tetris for the iPhone

393
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:05,366
Scott: instead.".

394
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,950
Scott: And those same people with just nothing except deciding to can switch over and do something different.

395
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:19,750
Scott: So if you can do that and the different thing you can do is more likely to be more profitable, how can you not?

396
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:29,996
Rym: So I think the real root of all this is that in the end, the games that we care about, the so-called good games in our opinion, they're going to be made primarily by kings.

397
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:34,790
Rym: And the shit games, the so-called casual social games, are going to be made by rich people.

398
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,577
Scott: But even look out, you know, the Madden still makes a ton of money.

399
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:42,290
Scott: The Call of Duty is like the hugest story of the past year or two, making so much money.

400
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,126
Rym: Oh yeah, but they're relatively few and also...

401
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,089
Scott: Portal 2 is going to rake it in.

402
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:54,710
Rym: But Scott, I note that most of that industry is built on the backs of overworked, underpaid programmers who eventually are going to freak their shit out and quit.

403
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,167
Scott: Well look at EA, what happened there with the overworking situation?

404
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,182
Rym: Look at every game company.

405
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:01,030
Rym: It's a serious problem.

406
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,890
Scott: Well, I think there's also the Minecraft situation you can't ignore.

407
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,413
Rym: That's a king.

408
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:05,642
Rym: He's a king.

409
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:06,789
Rym: Good games are coming out of kings.

410
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:10,048
Rym: I mean, I've got my secret project I'm working on.

411
00:23:17,092 --> 00:23:19,420
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

412
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:22,630
Rym: Many of you Tuesday listeners don't watch anime, that's fine.

413
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:31,690
Rym: But there's a show that, if you find this funny, I recommend you looking around for Hokuto Zankai Ken.

414
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:34,284
Scott: As your favorite Hokuto attack.

415
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,247
Rym: I think it's yours too.

416
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:41,750
Rym: And if you see that and like it, then there's this anime called Fist of the North Star that you'll actually like.

417
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:47,845
Rym: But what I have for you tonight is a machinima of Fist of the North Star done in Garry's Mod.

418
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,630
Rym: very, very well.

419
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,509
Rym: And I don't know what else I can say.

420
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:56,170
Scott: For the record, my favorite Hokuto technique is the one where he makes you, you can't control your own body.

421
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,750
Scott: And then you walk backwards into the lava.

422
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:00,010
Scott: Or if you're holding a shotgun, you aim it at yourself.

423
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:03,904
Rym: Well, that one wins because it's not like, it just slowly aims at him.

424
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,329
Rym: It's like whoop, whoop.

425
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:07,810
Scott: That is my favorite Hokuto technique.

426
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,810
Rym: I like to walk backwards over the cliff, same one.

427
00:24:10,854 --> 00:24:12,070
Scott: Anyway, my thing of the day.

428
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,294
Rym: Oh, Scott.

429
00:24:12,662 --> 00:24:12,785
Scott: Oh no.

430
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,390
Scott: That's my favorite Hokuto Ken joke.

431
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:17,790
Scott: Not my favorite technique.

432
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,130
Rym: What works about this is that you kind of stretch the faces in Garry's Mod to make them match the way those characters look.

433
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,390
Rym: And just the line, you're the smartest.

434
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,109
Rym: That's a good plan.

435
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,130
Scott: Anyway, so, check this little webcomic.

436
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,350
Scott: It's just four comic strips in a row, all with the same theme.

437
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:36,469
Scott: And the theme is caveman science fiction, and I lolled.

438
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:38,010
Scott: It's pretty good.

439
00:24:38,131 --> 00:24:40,550
Scott: If I loll, and Rym lolled, you will loll.

440
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,050
Rym: Well, I like the fact you pointed this out.

441
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,730
Scott: If you're a Geeknights listener and you don't loll, you suck.

442
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:44,710
Scott: Get out of here.

443
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:52,630
Rym: These cavemen and their conception of science fiction have envisioned a very small and yet surprisingly torridgily complex universe.

444
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:53,779
Scott: I know.

445
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:54,890
Scott: These are excellent comics.

446
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,288
Rym: I mean, it's- They're from dresdintcodak.com.

447
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:00,070
Scott: So, hooray for that guy and his webcomic.

448
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,270
Rym: So, in the meta moment, we'll be at MAGFEST.

449
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:07,550
Rym: We'll be on the MAG-9 talking about gaming in an intellectual context, also doing one of our own panels.

450
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:10,829
Scott: Also, Angry Video Game Nerd James Rolfe is going to be there.

451
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,232
Scott: Yeah.

452
00:25:11,252 --> 00:25:12,310
Rym: We're going to hook up with him.

453
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,370
Scott: Finally going to get to meet him, because we're big fans.

454
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:15,876
Scott: And John St.

455
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:16,561
Scott: John is going to be there.

456
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,185
Scott: We already met him.

457
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:17,930
Scott: We're friends with him.

458
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:19,094
Rym: John St.

459
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:21,610
Rym: John is actually a really funny guy in person.

460
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,209
Scott: MAGFEST is going to be a lot of drunkenness, except on my part.

461
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:24,772
Rym: Yeah.

462
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:25,729
Rym: The rest of us will be drunk.

463
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,830
Scott: I'm going to be playing games until I can't play games no more.

464
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,490
Rym: We're also going to be at PAX East, and my secret hint, soon we'll do a kind of PAX East pregame show.

465
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:42,110
Rym: Because as you all know, well, bitch PAX, PAX Boston 2011 is going to be in the BCEC, not the high knee.

466
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,810
Rym: Different location, everything is going to be all crazy.

467
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:51,250
Rym: The secret, the word on the street, the secret word is that there's going to be a much bigger tabletop presence.

468
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:52,930
Rym: Among other changes.

469
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,890
Rym: And if you own Bananagrams, I suggest you bring it, because there's going to be a lot of fucking Bananagrams at PAX Prime.

470
00:25:59,091 --> 00:25:59,356
Rym: Yeah.

471
00:25:59,498 --> 00:26:00,130
Rym: And PAX East.

472
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:04,230
Rym: We'll be there doing two or three panels, and we've got a bunch of other cons coming up.

473
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:12,210
Rym: Much more important, if you want to give us money, the GeekNights store has been online for a while now, and you can buy the original GeekNights t-shirt.

474
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,950
Rym: Supplies are actually kind of running out.

475
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,589
Scott: Is that the full supply on the floor there?

476
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:17,630
Rym: That's the full supply.

477
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,067
Rym: Wow.

478
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,229
Rym: That's all we've got left.

479
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:19,953
Scott: Alright.

480
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:22,330
Scott: Well, we will order more once we sell out.

481
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:25,150
Rym: I'm going to order more, yeah, as soon as we sell out.

482
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,250
Rym: So if like, ten more shirts get sold, we're going to order more of this one.

483
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,910
Scott: Did we fix the international order issue?

484
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,236
Rym: Uh, not quite.

485
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:33,890
Rym: I'm working on a workaround for that.

486
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:41,570
Scott: It's not because we don't want to, or, you know, it's because the technology is not set up to do it, and I didn't, you know, I let Rym do it, and that's what you get when you let Rym do it.

487
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,637
Rym: Well, I didn't write anything.

488
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:44,390
Rym: I used the Google automatic thing.

489
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:44,831
Scott: Yeah.

490
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:49,990
Scott: The week after PAX East is actually Zenkai Con 5 in Pennsylvania.

491
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:50,710
Rym: Yeah, we'll be there.

492
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,307
Scott: We'll be there, too.

493
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,268
Rym: We'll be doing stuff.

494
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,673
Rym: Uh... That's pretty much it.

495
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:58,650
Rym: The Book Club book coming up is Michio Kaku's Hyperspace.

496
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:02,030
Scott: And we're going to be talking about World War Z probably, like, in two days.

497
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,526
Rym: World War Z sucked ass.

498
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:03,890
Scott: I'm sorry.

499
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:07,350
Scott: Anyway, I finished reading it, we're going to do an episode on it, and we'll be done with it.

500
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,668
Rym: I noticed how before you'd finished it, you were like, "Rym, stop being so down on the book before we do the show.

501
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:12,130
Rym: Now you're just being

502
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,250
Rym: quiet.".

503
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:20,150
Scott: Well, I mean, no, you can be down on the book, just don't be publicly down on the book, because then people are going to, you know, accuse you of prejudice and all sorts of things.

504
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,013
Scott: You can avoid that.

505
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:25,730
Scott: If you had just waited until the actual episode to say it sucks, it would have been no problem.

506
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,829
Rym: I had already read the book.

507
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,429
Scott: The point is, you're supposed to not, you know...

508
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,329
Rym: Did the book suck?

509
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:33,990
Scott: Uh... I don't think it sucks as much as you say it sucks.

510
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,077
Rym: Well, it depends on your scale.

511
00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:39,470
Rym: On the scale of all books ever written, it's in, like, the top ten percent.

512
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:42,668
Scott: That is true.

513
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:48,190
Scott: You know, because I have the, you know, the courtesy to hold back and not reveal until the actual episode.

514
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,870
Rym: Ah, but I, being an open person who does not keep secrets...

515
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,790
Scott: I'm not keeping a secret.

516
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,445
Rym: I'm coming to you as the listeners and telling you exactly what I think.

517
00:27:57,485 --> 00:27:58,650
Rym: I'm divulging information.

518
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:00,710
Rym: I am, much like Assange.

519
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,070
Scott: You're ruining, you're decreasing the quality of our product, which is GeekNights.

520
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,630
Rym: So it's a decrease in quality to be truthful?

521
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,190
Scott: No, to be premature.

522
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,290
Rym: Forthcoming?

523
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:11,569
Scott: I'm sure the ladies would agree.

524
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:21,650
Rym: So, Rampart is, I'd say, in my top three of arcade games ever made.

525
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:24,270
Scott: I don't know if I'd say that.

526
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,357
Rym: How do they qualify that?

527
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,230
Rym: Versus arcade games.

528
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,769
Scott: I don't even know if I'd say that.

529
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,569
Rym: Name three that are better.

530
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,983
Rym: Better than arcade, versus arcade games that I would rather play than Rampart.

531
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,630
Rym: They have to actually exist and have to have been available in America.

532
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,549
Scott: Oh, in America?

533
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,770
Rym: Yeah, Jesus, I'm not, yeah.

534
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:45,490
Scott: Dance Dance Revolution.

535
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,718
Rym: Alright, yeah.

536
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,244
Rym: That's one.

537
00:28:47,284 --> 00:28:47,810
Rym: That's higher.

538
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:48,567
Scott: That's one.

539
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:50,350
Scott: Galaga isn't versus.

540
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:53,314
Scott: Versus.

541
00:28:53,394 --> 00:29:03,890
Scott: I mean, I could argue with Pong, depending if we were going to count based on my enjoyment versus overall quality versus influence versus historical value.

542
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,270
Rym: Yeah, I'm saying my enjoyment top three.

543
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:07,830
Scott: Pac-Man doesn't have a versus, really.

544
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:09,810
Scott: My enjoyment top three?

545
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,309
Rym: Yeah, because Rampart really does it, doesn't it?

546
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:21,430
Scott: Street Fighter, Super Street Fighter IV wasn't released in the US, but I could just pick any Street Fighter and that could beat out Rampart.

547
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:22,200
Rym: Yeah, that's two.

548
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:23,741
Scott: Initial D.

549
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:26,310
Rym: Yeah, Initial D is real good.

550
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:31,389
Scott: Initial D, but if not Initial D, there's plenty of racing games that are arcade machines I could put ahead.

551
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,343
Scott: Soul Calibur was in the arcades in the United States.

552
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:37,050
Scott: I could put that ahead of Rampart.

553
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,027
Rym: I think part of my contention is that...

554
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:41,879
Scott: Virtua Racing, definitely.

555
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,690
Rym: There's a racing game I'll put ahead of Rampart.

556
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,150
Rym: I am by no means undefeated.

557
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,370
Scott: The point is there's not a lot of arcade games that are versus that you're going to put ahead of Rampart.

558
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,150
Rym: When playing on the emulator...

559
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,118
Scott: It's on the short list.

560
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,390
Scott: Top ten, easily.

561
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:59,826
Rym: Playing on the emulator and playing on consoles and the way we play, I am by no means undefeated.

562
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,130
Rym: I'm quite often defeated.

563
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:06,430
Rym: But by crook and hook and luck, I am to this day undefeated on the arcade machine.

564
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,610
Scott: I think the other thing is that a lot of arcade machines, the trackballs are not well calibrated.

565
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:14,769
Rym: I think it's purely just the fact that I'm really good with the trackball and most people aren't.

566
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:18,710
Scott: The sensitivity's on, it's flaky, the mechanism is flaky.

567
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:21,350
Rym: I find it way less flaky than the fucking GameCube controller.

568
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:30,410
Scott: Game control has its own problems, but I'm saying if the game was controlled with a mouse, scroll wheel to spin, click to place, click to shoot, it would be beautiful.

569
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:31,750
Scott: It would be a work of art.

570
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,677
Rym: Rampart is an ancient arcade game.

571
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:37,390
Rym: It was ported to the NES and the SNES and all sorts of other places.

572
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,525
Rym: If you've never played this game...

573
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,909
Scott: You should play the actual music instead of me doing that.

574
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,542
Rym: Nah, not doing that.

575
00:30:43,623 --> 00:30:44,069
Rym: Do much work.

576
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,220
Rym: Get a copy of Rampart and play it against people.

577
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,224
Rym: Single player game, whatever.

578
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:49,570
Rym: The multiplayer is where it's at.

579
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,209
Scott: Get it on MAME or whatever you can get it on.

580
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,971
Scott: It's also on Midway Arcade Classics Volume 1.

581
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:56,070
Rym: Only get Volume 1.

582
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,590
Scott: For the PS2 and/or GameCube.

583
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,269
Rym: Because Volume 1, while it is just MAME...

584
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:01,690
Scott: Maybe the original Xbox, I don't know.

585
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,750
Rym: It's just MAME and a bunch of ROMs, but it has both Rampart and Satan's Hollow, also Sinistar.

586
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:07,565
Scott: Sinistar.

587
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:09,008
Rym: Oh man, I hunger.

588
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,308
Scott: I hunger.

589
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:18,610
Rym: But Rampart, you play Tetris and surround castles, and then you place cannons, and you shoot the cannons to everyone else's castles, and then you have to resurround the castles.

590
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,129
Rym: And that is fucking it.

591
00:31:21,132 --> 00:31:27,050
Scott: To explain that in more detail, you've got a section of a map, and all the different sections are surrounded by water.

592
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,078
Scott: These rivers, right?

593
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:29,510
Scott: And you've got three players maximum.

594
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:31,730
Scott: And in your little area are castles.

595
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:35,530
Scott: And you want to surround castles to stay alive.

596
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,530
Rym: Good job, Orange Commander.

597
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,071
Scott: Right.

598
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:40,270
Scott: So you want to surround the castle completely.

599
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:46,170
Scott: That means you've got to completely enclose it so that the walls prevent anyone from walking into your castle.

600
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:47,590
Scott: Even diagonally, right?

601
00:31:47,851 --> 00:31:50,530
Rym: Every round, you have to have a castle surrounded, or you die.

602
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,059
Rym: And that's it.

603
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,390
Rym: You're done.

604
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,410
Scott: So at least one castle has to be surrounded.

605
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,670
Scott: And you get these Tetris pieces that aren't the same exact shapes as Tetris pieces.

606
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,949
Scott: They're all sorts of varying shapes.

607
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:00,130
Rym: And the worst part is...

608
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,590
Scott: You don't get to choose the shape.

609
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,720
Rym: The shapes start out like single tile, double tile.

610
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,710
Rym: Later, they're like eight tile random monster.

611
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,390
Scott: The plus is the worst, right?

612
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,630
Rym: I don't know the plus, but also that U-shaped one in the end of the game.

613
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,670
Scott: And the S. The U-shaped one seems to always show up at a time when I can really use it nicely.

614
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:17,919
Scott: But the S is a fucker.

615
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,410
Scott: Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's bad.

616
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,990
Rym: It's not a Tetris S. Imagine like four Tetris S's.

617
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,130
Scott: I just wish I could always get the three stick.

618
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,954
Scott: You know?

619
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:25,990
Scott: Just always three stick.

620
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,090
Scott: And maybe the one piece when I really need it.

621
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,530
Rym: See, if we remade it, there should be some sort of draft for the pieces.

622
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,290
Scott: No, because it'd take too long, right?

623
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,090
Scott: But anyway, you get these pieces and you have a time limit.

624
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,970
Scott: So the number of pieces you can place depends on how quickly you move.

625
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,030
Rym: Maybe you've got to get the pieces delivered by a ship.

626
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,870
Rym: And you shoot the guy's walls or shoot the ships delivering the good pieces.

627
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,452
Scott: We'll see.

628
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:49,230
Scott: Anyway, you place the pieces really quickly to surround the castles.

629
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:53,370
Scott: And then after you've surrounded the castles, depending on how much area you've surrounded.

630
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,949
Scott: Because, I mean, you could just surround the castle and nothing else, but then you wouldn't have any area.

631
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,370
Scott: You've also got to surround land, you know, so that you have areas to put your cannons.

632
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,716
Rym: Also getting points.

633
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:04,870
Rym: More points means more cannons and it means winning.

634
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:11,810
Scott: So ideally, the ideal play would be to completely surround your entire area with one layer of walls.

635
00:33:12,252 --> 00:33:15,070
Scott: And the entire inner area would be just completely open.

636
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,485
Scott: And that is never even close to happening.

637
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:18,890
Rym: You've got like 20 fucking seconds.

638
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,270
Scott: If you do that, you're fucking cheating.

639
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,285
Scott: And you get your first castle for free.

640
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:25,070
Scott: It's not too bad.

641
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:26,970
Scott: So then you get to place cannons.

642
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,410
Scott: And the more area you've got surrounded, the more cannons you get to place.

643
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,310
Scott: But, if you place too many cannons, it's hard to surround the cannons, you see.

644
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,630
Scott: Because you can't put pieces where the cannons are.

645
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,089
Rym: You also can't get rid of cannons.

646
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:41,170
Scott: Oh, you can if someone helps you out.

647
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,190
Rym: No, they stay there broken.

648
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,386
Scott: They stay there broken, so.

649
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:45,270
Rym: Because here's the deal with this game.

650
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,478
Rym: Alright, it sounds pretty simple.

651
00:33:46,518 --> 00:33:48,150
Rym: I shoot the other guy's walls, then we build.

652
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,970
Rym: So, smart people will shoot like one hole in the corner surrounded by other blocks.

653
00:33:54,251 --> 00:33:57,930
Rym: So the dude literally needs a one piece or he cannot survive.

654
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,230
Scott: Yup, and basically if he doesn't get a one piece, he's gotta use all his pieces to surround some other castle.

655
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,630
Scott: Because that first castle, it ain't gonna happen this turn.

656
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,268
Rym: Many times, I'll have one awesome castle with like nine cannons in it.

657
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,489
Rym: That is just fucked.

658
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:14,429
Rym: And I'm holding on to like another castle on the other side of my territory with like one baby cannon in there.

659
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,030
Scott: Waiting for a one piece to save the previous castle.

660
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:22,409
Scott: And of course, every turn, the big swipe comes down and wipes away a whole bunch of pieces.

661
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:26,590
Rym: Every round that you have one cannon and Rym's playing, Rym's blowing up that cannon.

662
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,489
Scott: That's right, because you can destroy someone else's cannon with ten bullets.

663
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,810
Scott: So if you fire ten bullets, you can destroy someone else's cannon.

664
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,789
Scott: If they only have one, now they can't shoot at you this turn.

665
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,989
Scott: I cannot express to you.

666
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,969
Scott: Maybe they'll get one shot off because the shooting is real time.

667
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,690
Scott: Maybe they'll get one or two shots off before you destroy their cannon.

668
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,770
Rym: How crazy fun Rampart is in direct versus.

669
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:46,409
Scott: Rampart is the most fun.

670
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,070
Rym: It has this right balance of multiple game modes, very quick gameplay, very high skill cap.

671
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,085
Rym: Like your skill matters a lot.

672
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,188
Scott: A whole lot.

673
00:34:55,451 --> 00:34:57,270
Rym: And it's one of those games, kind of like a fighting game.

674
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,649
Rym: Where, you know, if I play against a random M. Bison online, I don't even get a hit in.

675
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:03,409
Rym: Like it's like start and I'm dead.

676
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:06,990
Rym: That's the way a noob is against someone who's played Rampart in Rampart.

677
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,530
Scott: Yeah, you're not going to surround your castle and therefore you're not going to stay alive.

678
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,730
Scott: The worst, the thing about Rampart is the way the game works, right?

679
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,650
Scott: Is if you die three times, you lose because you get three continues.

680
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,830
Rym: Well, no, that's just because we're playing the Maim ROM.

681
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,090
Rym: I mean, you decide the rules.

682
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,058
Rym: You can mess with that.

683
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:23,510
Rym: You can say no continues, whatever.

684
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:30,630
Scott: But anyway, if you, if everyone dies in the same time, then whoever's the highest score actually wins.

685
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:35,890
Scott: And if everyone survives to the final battle, then whoever's the highest score wins.

686
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:42,829
Scott: But no matter how many continues you have, if you die or how much higher your score is, if you die on the final battle, that's it.

687
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:44,830
Rym: So sometimes you got to go for it.

688
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:51,095
Rym: You're like, all right, I'm going to die on purpose now to try to get more points by starting fresh and getting rid of all this BS.

689
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:54,810
Rym: But maybe now I'll die for real because I run out of lives.

690
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,302
Scott: Yeah, or like one, let's say one guy's doing so well.

691
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:58,810
Scott: He's got all his castles surrounded.

692
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,069
Scott: He's got a ton of cannons and every single round he's getting a zillion points.

693
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:14,515
Scott: But if you find a way to just be alive for the final battle and then poke him in just the right spot to where he cannot survive on the final battle, even though he's got a bajillion points and you survive, you could win that.

694
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:16,690
Scott: So you don't give up until the very end.

695
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,750
Rym: So it's the game that has a very good mechanic of you're never out.

696
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:28,850
Scott: You can always still if you're alive, if you're alive and you surround the castle and you surround it, if you have at least one castle surrounded, you can win Rampart.

697
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:32,590
Rym: Now, one reason we bring this game up, I mean, there's not that much else to say about it.

698
00:36:32,811 --> 00:36:36,970
Rym: The SNES like that port of it actually has a lot more going on.

699
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,010
Scott: The only versions of Rampart I've ever seen are the SNES version, which is different.

700
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:47,930
Scott: I think the arcade version, which is the same as the one that's in Midway Arcade Classics, because it's just a main ROM of the arcade version.

701
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:56,469
Rym: The SNES one, you can build a mega cannon that shoots way slow and takes a bunch of normal cannons up, but it leaves fire that you can't build stuff on.

702
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,630
Scott: There's also a single player Rampart where there's boats and soldiers attacking you.

703
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,029
Rym: Yeah, the boats drop tanks, grunts.

704
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,844
Scott: Yeah, but it's kind of bleh.

705
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:04,329
Scott: I don't like it.

706
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,373
Rym: Well, it would be fun.

707
00:37:06,196 --> 00:37:10,090
Rym: My biggest complaint with Rampart is that for its time, it is unparalleled.

708
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:11,674
Rym: It is an amazing game.

709
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:17,268
Rym: And yet, to this day, no one has made that game again.

710
00:37:17,288 --> 00:37:17,368
Rym: well.

711
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:23,250
Rym: It's one of those games, like, you know, we did this panel at PAX, egregiously unrealized potential.

712
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,156
Rym: And we didn't talk about Rampart.

713
00:37:25,217 --> 00:37:28,250
Rym: Rampart is one of the most painfully unrealized.

714
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:32,270
Rym: Anyone could just take this game and make the same goddamn game.

715
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:37,950
Scott: With no changes, just add network multiplayer and control it with the mouse, and it would be awesome.

716
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:40,624
Scott: No changes, no thought.

717
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:41,250
Scott: You just clone it.

718
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,246
Rym: Or go one step further and make it, like, crazy.

719
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:44,970
Rym: Like, add stuff.

720
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:48,370
Scott: Yeah, I'm saying it would be awesome if you did nothing.

721
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:52,090
Scott: But assuming you're going to do something, you can only make it more awesome, right?

722
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,909
Scott: Here's some things that can make Rampart even more awesome, right?

723
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:57,709
Scott: Co-op versus the computer mode.

724
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,709
Scott: Co-op, like, teams versus teams.

725
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,058
Scott: Four player mode.

726
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:01,964
Scott: Two on two mode.

727
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,788
Rym: Eight players.

728
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:09,510
Scott: You know, varying numbers of continues, changing rule sets, different stuff like that.

729
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:17,926
Scott: Maybe a mode where you can place a cannon, but if you place a cannon outside your walls or in the water, it makes a boat that attacks the other guys instead of a cannon, right?

730
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:18,590
Scott: You have options.

731
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,330
Rym: Or maybe you've also got the armies, you know, the little grunts, and you're standing after each other.

732
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:29,770
Scott: You could choose cannons, make a fast cannon or a slow, powerful cannon where the cannonball destroys four squares.

733
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:33,310
Scott: Or destroys a cannon in two hits, or, you know, stuff like that.

734
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,389
Scott: You know, you can mix it up a little bit in there.

735
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,170
Rym: I mean, or go one step further, like, my crazy idea.

736
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,809
Rym: I don't think I have the resources to make this.

737
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,630
Rym: You know, Guns of Icarus, Muse, they made that, Emily and Alex and all our friends.

738
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:50,190
Rym: But it was the idea that it was a co-op FPS tower defense kind of game, you know, on an airship.

739
00:38:50,731 --> 00:38:58,370
Rym: What if Rampart was an NS style, you're running around in effectively Minecraft building walls and manning cannons.

740
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,676
Scott: Well that was an idea I had, right?

741
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:01,747
Scott: What if you just took Minecraft and the way it worked is?

742
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:02,350
Scott: there were cannons.

743
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,721
Scott: And there were two sides and there was water.

744
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:06,049
Scott: you couldn't cross between them.

745
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,790
Scott: And the game, everyone had a castle that they had to defend.

746
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,490
Scott: So basically it would be like, alright, the timer begins, go.

747
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,710
Scott: And everyone has to build walls in Minecraft.

748
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:20,930
Scott: So you have a whole team of people, tons of people building walls in between the enemy and your castle.

749
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,787
Scott: And then you'd be like, alright, time's up.

750
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:31,530
Scott: Now everyone fire cannons and you aim, everyone plays an FPS where they stand still and shoot cannons at the enemy's walls trying to hit the enemy's castle.

751
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,510
Scott: And then time's up, rebuild walls and you keep switching back and forth.

752
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:40,670
Rym: There are nearly infinite variations on this theme and all of them, it's kind of like when we were talking about...

753
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,590
Scott: It'd be hard to make a version that was not good.

754
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,862
Rym: It's kind of like when we were talking about Fallout 3 and how it was fun.

755
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:53,630
Rym: but if they just removed all that combat BS and just made it a series of really interesting, basically a graphical choose your own adventure with a lot of stuff.

756
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:55,800
Rym: We dismissed it like, yeah, that's just a big.

757
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,308
Rym: choose your own adventure, dot dot dot.

758
00:39:57,811 --> 00:39:59,849
Rym: And I would play the ever living fuck out of a game like that.

759
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:05,430
Scott: Yeah, if it was just the choose your own adventure and didn't try to cloud it with stupid RPG leveling and combat.

760
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,279
Rym: I'd play the crap out of old Rampart.

761
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,023
Rym: A new Rampart?

762
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:09,490
Rym: I would play that every day.

763
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,137
Scott: Yeah, we still play old Rampart.

764
00:40:11,177 --> 00:40:12,161
Scott: It's sort of like Bomberman.

765
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:14,370
Scott: You whip it out at the parties and it's always a hit.

766
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:21,550
Scott: And the thing is, unlike Bomberman where you have to worry about what version to play, you can't go wrong because there's only one version of Rampart.

767
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,090
Rym: Well, there's the SNES one.

768
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,090
Scott: But that's only two player max, it's no good.

769
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:28,329
Scott: You can't get the four score in on that, it doesn't work.

770
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:31,017
Rym: Yeah, but three player works well.

771
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:35,110
Rym: but it also has that kind of game theory problem that all three player games have.

772
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,630
Rym: Which is, Scott always claims that everyone just attacked him and that's why he died.

773
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:39,810
Scott: Which is true, sometimes.

774
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:40,050
Scott: Never.

775
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:40,750
Scott: It's possible.

776
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:41,970
Rym: It is possible.

777
00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:42,528
Scott: And it happens.

778
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:48,450
Scott: Usually what happens in Rampart is whoever looks like they're doing well is going to get ganged up on.

779
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:54,530
Scott: If someone has a whole bunch of walls and a whole bunch of cannons, then the other two players are going to concentrate their fire on that guy first.

780
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,510
Scott: And then maybe shoot each other a little bit.

781
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,249
Rym: It's always funny to watch us play.

782
00:40:58,531 --> 00:41:03,650
Scott: And then the guy who's doing really well is going to concentrate most of his fire on the guy who's doing second best.

783
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,130
Scott: And then maybe fire some token shots at the guy who's doing third best.

784
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:13,970
Rym: But every time we're playing, you'll see right before the game starts, Scott and I both have our crosshairs over Scott Johnson.

785
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,550
Rym: And then as soon as firing starts, suddenly my crosshairs go to Scott, who's going to me?

786
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:24,630
Scott: The thing is, in Rampart, let's say someone is doing kind of shitty but they're alive.

787
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,309
Scott: They've got one cannon.

788
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:34,310
Scott: If you ignore that guy who's in last place for even one round, you don't fire a single shot at him, the next round he's going to be insanely powerful.

789
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,090
Scott: He's going to surround a second castle and fill it in with six cannons and have seven cannons.

790
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:42,870
Scott: So even though a guy's in third place, you cannot afford to completely ignore him.

791
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,229
Scott: You've got to fire some bullets his way to force him to do some work every round.

792
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,350
Scott: Otherwise you're asking for it.

793
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:58,590
Rym: The game multiplayer-wise also has the good continuing mechanic of as you keep playing games, the scores continue to recrue and whoever won the last round gets increasingly handicapped.

794
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:05,970
Scott: Yeah, if you play multiple rounds of Rampart, so we play a round and we go all the way to final battle and Rym wins.

795
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,615
Scott: Then we play another round.

796
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:10,750
Scott: Rym only has three castles and everyone else has four castles.

797
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:15,290
Scott: It actually gives Rym a disadvantage because he won the prior rounds.

798
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:22,750
Scott: Also, I'm not completely sure about this, but when you're on your second and third continues, your cannons look different?

799
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,370
Rym: They're not different.

800
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:28,510
Scott: They just look different so that you can tell that that person is on their second or third continue.

801
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,763
Scott: They don't actually fire faster or do anything like that.

802
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,410
Scott: They definitely don't do more damage.

803
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:37,450
Rym: However, I have fostered that false belief in other people in order to make them lose.

804
00:42:39,411 --> 00:42:42,808
Scott: How would that make someone lose if they think their cannons are powered up?

805
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:47,425
Rym: In Katsu-Kan, when we had all those Rampart games we were playing with everybody, I could have lost this game.

806
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:49,933
Rym: It was kind of dicey.

807
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:57,429
Rym: I convinced the guy next to me that he should attack the guy one next to him because that guy had the "better cannons".

808
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,610
Scott: Oh, interesting.

809
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,073
Rym: It worked really well.

810
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:07,050
Rym: Man, that Katsu-Kan, they got a Rampart goddamn machine and they put it in our video game room.

811
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,180
Rym: We ran a Rampart tournament that was surprisingly well attended.

812
00:43:10,561 --> 00:43:12,910
Rym: Rampart is well known and well loved among good gamers.

813
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:15,235
Rym: So, I don't know.

814
00:43:15,516 --> 00:43:16,200
Rym: Play Rampart.

815
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:18,049
Rym: If you've never played it, play it.

816
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:22,061
Rym: There's almost nothing bad to say about this game.

817
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:23,990
Scott: The only complaints I have are that it's old.

818
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:28,049
Scott: Yeah, basically it's an old forgotten game and the controls are dated.

819
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:33,070
Scott: It was designed to work with a trackball and a two-button control system, right?

820
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:38,950
Scott: But the trackballs on the old arcade machines are difficult to use and very low sensitivity.

821
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:49,490
Scott: And if you try to play any of the Midway Arcade Classics releases or a MAME version, it's going to be really tricky to configure your mouse to work with the game properly.

822
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:51,212
Scott: It's not going to be good.

823
00:43:52,014 --> 00:44:00,450
Scott: But if someone were to remake the game, the ideal controls would be mouse to move your crosshair when shooting and to click to fire your cannon when shooting.

824
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:08,310
Scott: And when placing Tetris pieces, mouse to move the Tetris piece, scroll wheel to spin the Tetris piece, and mouse click to place the Tetris piece.

825
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,335
Rym: There's one trouble with that.

826
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,330
Rym: We would have to have way bigger maps or somehow make the game more difficult.

827
00:44:12,731 --> 00:44:18,190
Rym: Because I imagine playing right now, if I had a mouse and keyboard, I would literally be all the castles are surrounded.

828
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,479
Scott: Yeah, that's part of the thing.

829
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,070
Scott: Improving the controls would actually make the game too easy.

830
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,324
Rym: Kind of like if you play Halo with a keyboard and mouse.

831
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:27,707
Rym: that was legit.

832
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,333
Scott: Yeah, right?

833
00:44:29,394 --> 00:44:30,176
Scott: Exactly.

834
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,490
Scott: The thing is you can't not make that control improvement.

835
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:41,800
Scott: So I think you start by making the control improvement, seeing how the game plays, and then tweaking the game.

836
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,822
Scott: Maybe making it harder.

837
00:44:42,902 --> 00:44:47,870
Scott: Maybe increasing the size or the resolution of the wall squares.

838
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:54,190
Rym: Of course, just making the game bigger would solve that because the maps are way tiny because of the limitations of the day.

839
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:59,790
Scott: But the thing is the tininess also makes it hard to put all the pieces in because you're so cramped.

840
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:04,250
Scott: And if you made it bigger, it might be too easy to get your pieces in because the crampedness would go away.

841
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:10,830
Scott: There needs to be a little rebalancing there if indeed the easier controls make the game too easy.

842
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:17,389
Rym: Grunts would really fix it because grunts are basically just tanks that drive around and if they touch a castle they surround it and destroy it.

843
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,258
Rym: And then you're just down one castle.

844
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,849
Rym: But also you can't place blocks on top of them.

845
00:45:23,594 --> 00:45:25,870
Rym: And they just wedge themselves in your wall and now you're fucked.

846
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,513
Scott: That could actually be something, right?

847
00:45:28,713 --> 00:45:37,890
Scott: You could have a kind of cannon that shoots over to the other side and is a cannonball, but the cannonball is stuck in the ground.

848
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,039
Rym: So not only does it destroy a spot, it prevents you from building on that spot.

849
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,436
Rym: In the SNES there are villages.

850
00:45:46,516 --> 00:45:50,070
Rym: If you surround a village, it turns into tanks that go attack the other guy.

851
00:45:50,632 --> 00:45:56,310
Rym: If you build over a village or blow a village up on your own side, it turns into tanks that fuck you.

852
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,930
Scott: There's all kinds of creative ways this game can be improved and modified and tricked out.

853
00:46:03,772 --> 00:46:07,910
Scott: And the fact that the base game is just so strong, it's like you can't fuck it up.

854
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:12,150
Rym: Yeah, James Rolfe keeps saying, well he said it once, we should remake Demons to Diamonds.

855
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:15,264
Rym: Yeah, it's a good game, but remake Rampart.

856
00:46:15,385 --> 00:46:16,190
Rym: Rampart's way better.

857
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,470
Rym: Not that much harder to remake.

858
00:46:17,892 --> 00:46:20,402
Scott: Yeah, no, not at all.

859
00:46:20,663 --> 00:46:22,350
Scott: Just surround your castles and stay alive.

860
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,630
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

861
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:36,750
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

862
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:42,170
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

863
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:45,090
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

864
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:49,850
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

865
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:53,366
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

866
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,690
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

867
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,790
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
