00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,986
Scott: It's Thursday August 24th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:17,950
Scott: tonight You will finally hear the tale of the front row crew.

3
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:26,334
Scott: Let's do this Some at work today.

4
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:31,390
Scott: and for those of you who do not know I work alone in an office in the middle of nowhere.

5
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:34,985
Rym: There are stories about that that Scott probably can't tell on the air.

6
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:42,130
Scott: Yes, and People really don't seem to pay attention to what I'm doing or give me a lot of instructions on what to do.

7
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:52,456
Scott: I mean, they didn't even do that when I was working next to them in the same office in New York City, but Nonetheless today I got an email that said hey How is X coming along?

8
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,946
Scott: and I said X is about 90% done.

9
00:00:56,327 --> 00:01:04,860
Scott: and they were like awesome alright, and I was like, okay and For those of you who don't know of course said.

10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:13,030
Scott: for those of you who don't know I know I don't know why I said that again But let me tell you I haven't worked on X for an entire week.

11
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:17,490
Scott: In fact in all of this week, I have done zero work at work.

12
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:20,205
Scott: I have played Fire Emblem and browse the web at work.

13
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:20,788
Scott: That's about it.

14
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:28,280
Rym: Well, all I have to say is that if you keep this up for another two weeks uninterrupted You'll beat my IBM record if not doing work.

15
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:32,562
Scott: I think actually though next week I am going to finish the final 10% of X.

16
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:43,750
Rym: Well, see my rule when it comes to counting not doing work If you do work for less than one half hour per day, I consider it not working at all.

17
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:51,170
Scott: No I think what I'm actually gonna do is work all day For like two or three days and just finish the whole thing and it'll be perfect and amazing.

18
00:01:51,737 --> 00:02:00,554
Rym: See, I wish I could do that but in my job most of my work involves just waiting for other people to do the piece of their crap so that I can then do all my Paperwork and finish everything up.

19
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:02,118
Scott: Yeah, see my work.

20
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:11,085
Scott: as soon as someone gives me, you know tells me what they want made I could just make it and it's all me and I can do whatever and get it done.

21
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:19,369
Scott: and I realize now that The people at my company are never going to give me instructions as detailed as I would like them to give me.

22
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:29,170
Scott: so I pretty much have to take what they ask and then do my own thing and you know, do what I think is best and Apparently they'll be pleased with it no matter what I come up with.

23
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,846
Scott: So that's what I'm doing from now on because I don't really care if I get fired.

24
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:33,830
Scott: I'm bored sitting there.

25
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,658
Rym: They're not gonna fire you.

26
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,870
Rym: I've learned that people do this.

27
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,290
Rym: Don't you have to be such a fuck-up to be fired?

28
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,172
Scott: but here's the thing.

29
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:50,230
Scott: when I first got to the company like they were firing people like People I thought were cool and doing work and I've seen some internal thing.

30
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:57,536
Scott: Well, I don't know but people talk about you know, like oh so-and-so isn't really good their work and all this kind of.

31
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:57,918
Scott: you know what.

32
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:04,579
Rym: as far as I'm concerned very few of the people I've ever worked with Really were good at the job.

33
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,683
Rym: They were supposed to be doing.

34
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,031
Rym: Yeah, it's I'd say less than 10%.

35
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:12,726
Scott: Yeah, but you know, the point is is that they fire people where I work.

36
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:16,884
Rym: and yeah Yeah, I've been having the opposite issue lately.

37
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:17,810
Rym: other I mean not the op.

38
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,775
Rym: I wish I had work to do.

39
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:22,275
Rym: I have so little work to do and I do it all and then I kind of Look like I'm busy.

40
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:35,019
Rym: or I wait for more work to come or I ask for work but I'm starting to meet more of my co-workers and starting like I'm talking to more people around the office and in the other sites and without fail every time I Like people eat.

41
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:35,886
Rym: Oh, what did you before?

42
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:36,330
Rym: What are you doing?

43
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:44,381
Rym: I tell him, you know I was a Linux this admin and I did development for this and I worked IBM and blah blah blah and They stare at me and they always ask in the exact same tone.

44
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,609
Rym: So why are you here?

45
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:50,429
Scott: Because you're paying me more to do less.

46
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:53,749
Rym: Yeah, except the thing is I probably still did last at IBM.

47
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:54,773
Rym: I just did.

48
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:58,187
Rym: I did more real work, but I did a lot less total work.

49
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:58,669
Rym: I mean IBM.

50
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:08,428
Rym: I'd basically do nothing But then they'd ask me for something like do X and I would do X Wonderfully and immediately and then there was nothing to do for another month.

51
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:11,619
Rym: Hmm other than you know busy work that I could generally avoid.

52
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,322
Rym: Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:13,345
Rym: Whatever.

54
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:14,790
Rym: Maybe we'll start a business and beacon.

55
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:18,502
Rym: Maybe it's looking more and more attractive as time goes on.

56
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:24,744
Scott: Yeah, even if it's financially Terrible, it'll be a lot more interesting and I won't feel like shit.

57
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:26,410
Scott: I'll feel like I'm doing something with my life.

58
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:35,070
Rym: Yeah Cuz once my that's more important to me than money right now once my student loans are paid off I could live on very little money relative to what I need now to survive.

59
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,777
Rym: Yeah, I mean I could live on.

60
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:42,549
Rym: I could probably live pretty comfortably on $30,000 a year if I didn't have all my debt.

61
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:53,430
Rym: Mmm now I think I could manage to run a business where I could make at least $30,000 a year or at least I could make enough money on the side to round out that much money.

62
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:59,010
Scott: Yeah, maybe it really depends, you know, we got to learn more about starting a business.

63
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,550
Scott: But you know a lot of people out there run businesses that aren't really smart and we're pretty damn smart.

64
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,582
Scott: I mean, they're like butchers.

65
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:08,910
Scott: they run a butcher shop.

66
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:09,833
Rym: So here's the thing.

67
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:20,629
Rym: while I while a computer shop would be the optimum thing in terms of enjoyment I think the best business we could open in this area is a sub shop in the vein of de bella's.

68
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:26,830
Rym: Yep, I agree I'm reasonably certain that if we got together the capital and did that we could make a shit ton of money.

69
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:33,248
Rym: But for a number of years we would have to personally manage and work at a sub shop.

70
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:43,773
Scott: Yeah Yeah, tell you what you work at the sub shop, right and I'll sit at home I'll manage the sub shop and you can Work at it.

71
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:45,498
Scott: You can bake the bread.

72
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:47,264
Scott: I'll make the bread.

73
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:49,250
Scott: set up the point-of-sale systems.

74
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:54,570
Scott: Yeah, all right now you can see why we still have work at shitty jobs.

75
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:58,109
Rym: Yeah, though I have another completely unrelated Scott bit of news here.

76
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:08,570
Rym: All right, because recently now we had though You know the week of awesome and everything and one advantage that was if we had to hang out with a lot of friends We don't get to see often like James and Lisa who are in Texas.

77
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:17,770
Rym: But at one point it ended up being myself Scott and yuko driving together to the shore And Scott and I didn't have our voices so much.

78
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:23,520
Rym: So it was mostly yuko talking and us listening and nodding and periodically saying things then going because our throats hurt.

79
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:35,290
Rym: hmm and Ever since Otakon and the shore and all this time we hung out with all these people Scott has been pretty much talking like a tiny bastardized yuko.

80
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:45,875
Scott: Well, you know whenever anyone there are people out there who have sayings like I have sayings Yeah, well, there are things I say often like like, you know Oh god.

81
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:49,749
Scott: Oh god, the word penis the word penis There are many, you know people have.

82
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:56,428
Scott: Every person who's a real person tends to have catchphrases and yuko like most people has some catchphrases.

83
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,116
Scott: Oh, man Oh man's.

84
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:05,715
Scott: by the by and by the by now Oh Man's was very apparent to me.

85
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:10,609
Scott: I realized oh man's was a yuko catchphrase and recently I decided to steal it.

86
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,719
Scott: Oh, I didn't actually consciously decide this.

87
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:13,322
Rym: Yeah, it's more like.

88
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,090
Rym: I noticed that he was saying it a lot.

89
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,416
Scott: Yeah, like it just rubs off.

90
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,582
Scott: You know, I remember in high school.

91
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:21,133
Scott: There was a kid Brandon something and Not Rym rims.

92
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:21,997
Scott: real name is Brandon.

93
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:23,703
Rym: Yeah, well one of my names.

94
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:24,928
Scott: Yeah your real name.

95
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:31,390
Scott: So And he would always say like dos equis, I don't know why he said dos equis.

96
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:46,809
Scott: If you don't know dos equis is that Mexican alcohol with the two X's on it though Because dos is two and equis is X. yes, and he would just be like dos equis and I'd be like Dos equis and like all of a sudden the whole group of people that like were closer to him.

97
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:54,650
Scott: I just rubbed off than me in physics class But other people he talked to like it would rub off on them and they'd say dos equis a lot

98
00:07:55,731 --> 00:08:08,220
Rym: general it seems to be more a thing among geeks than other people lately is that these sorts of mannerisms and catchphrases are viral and they spread like wildfire among people who are susceptible to them and independent of that.

99
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:14,359
Rym: it is generally known that people who are perceived as being Charismatic or having some sort of presence.

100
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,510
Rym: This is stuff why we talked about in all those communications classes I took at RIT since I basically took the whole major.

101
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:34,048
Rym: but one thing we learned about a lot was that people who appear charismatic something they do either consciously or a lot of times subconsciously is That they will mimic the body language mannerisms and sometimes accents of those around them.

102
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:38,144
Rym: Mmm, and Scott and I seem to do that a lot.

103
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:39,048
Scott: Of course.

104
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:45,806
Scott: I do that a lot I noticed like sometimes like the way I talk will just change completely when I'm with different people.

105
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:59,030
Rym: I have a funny story Yeah, where I was interviewing for a job and at one point one of the international business manager to the company I was interviewing with decided he wanted to talk to me and he's this British guy and he travels all over the call.

106
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,301
Scott: They were just like right.

107
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:13,670
Rym: I wasn't like that, but he starts talking to me and I started like I was talking normally and then I realized halfway through that I Was kind of doing a sort of fake British accent.

108
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,967
Rym: Totally didn't realize it and I suddenly noticed it and I was really kind of.

109
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:20,910
Rym: I wasn't embarrassed.

110
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,756
Rym: It was more that I didn't know what to do.

111
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,762
Rym: Do I suddenly stop doing it?

112
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:27,430
Rym: Do I just pretend I've got this accent?

113
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,374
Rym: What do I do?

114
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,906
Rym: and I was kind of like deer in headlights for a minute?

115
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:33,055
Scott: Yeah What did he look?

116
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:34,843
Scott: does he do you look weird at you or anything?

117
00:09:34,863 --> 00:09:35,907
Rym: He seemed to really like me.

118
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:37,034
Scott: Yeah All right, that's.

119
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:47,513
Rym: I don't think he ever heard me talk normally though And it wasn't like I was talking like get in the vase Or anything.

120
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:56,420
Rym: it was just there was a little bit of and I was saying words that I'd often don't normally say and it was like Boot and schedule.

121
00:09:57,243 --> 00:10:07,919
Rym: I did say leisure a number of times But I do for fun and I was like well in my leisure time I Did The word.

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,405
Rym: that was actually the moment I realized what I was doing because I said leisure in a not like.

123
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:19,930
Rym: I say leisure sometimes funnily but I usually say leisure and I Realized when I said leisure that I said it because the guy was speaking British.

124
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,679
Rym: Yep, so but it's not just the whole front row crew.

125
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,000
Rym: Does it?

126
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,525
Rym: it's a very big thing among us.

127
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:25,890
Rym: Yes, anyway mimic each other.

128
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,463
Scott: Yeah, so oh, man's I realized when I was saying oh, man's that it was.

129
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:30,065
Scott: I was like.

130
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:34,030
Scott: I said oh man's once and I was Saying I stole totally stole it.

131
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:38,710
Scott: Oh, well, I'll keep saying it cuz oh man's is cool and I've been saying oh man's recently.

132
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:47,070
Rym: So today Scott comes up and he says to me so Rym by the by and I didn't realize That by the by was a saying of anyone.

133
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,530
Scott: I mean, I've heard it before in my life, but I didn't realize it was a yuko thing.

134
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:56,810
Rym: Yeah, I stopped him and I was like, um Scott you're turning into yuko except you're not nearly as cute.

135
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:03,779
Scott: Yeah, I'd ever noticed that she said by the by at all and I guess I'm gonna stop saying that cuz it's not as I Would say that it's not as cool as oh, man's.

136
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:12,539
Rym: I would say that a good two-thirds of the conversation She starts with me begin with hey Rym Oh, man's by the by or some permutation thereof.

137
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,341
Scott: Yeah.

138
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:15,767
Rym: Oh, man's oh man's by the by.

139
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:18,814
Rym: you should know that a woman's That doesn't work.

140
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:19,337
Scott: No, it doesn't.

141
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:20,020
Rym: All right.

142
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,949
Rym: Anyway, we got some news I guess.

143
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:27,095
Rym: Okay, even though it's funny you guys out there always seem to say that Oh, we want to hear the news.

144
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:32,060
Rym: Don't get rid of the news, but we always get the most feedback from the throwaway crap We do before the news.

145
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,673
Rym: Yeah, so whatever All right.

146
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:42,050
Rym: There was a thing called or cuts Orcutt might be before your time for some of you younger internet kids.

147
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,915
Scott: Well his it was.

148
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:46,897
Scott: um, I'll sum up the story of or cut ready first off I'll sum it up in the I won't.

149
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,785
Rym: it was a flash in the pan.

150
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:49,990
Rym: Yeah, that's what it was.

151
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,075
Scott: Let me sum up the story.

152
00:11:51,095 --> 00:12:05,886
Scott: There was a guy who developed some social You know computing technology social networking, yeah, he basically invented like myspace friendster, I don't even know and Like he worked for Google and then he didn't work for Google or he worked for someone else.

153
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:07,142
Scott: make I think yeah That's it.

154
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,605
Scott: He invented this shit at another company that was social website type stuff and he.

155
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:21,147
Scott: then he went to Google and at Google He made Orca and the other company was like hey You just made that here and then you went to Google and made the same thing for them.

156
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:21,650
Scott: What the hell?

157
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,741
Rym: Yeah, it was a really well executed social networking thing.

158
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:35,817
Rym: that part of the gimmicks of it were that one you had to put your Real contact information in and the real information about yourself and you actually got in trouble if you lied in this thing Like they would get rid of you.

159
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:41,732
Scott: Yeah, and it was invite only Invite only mostly like most Google things now that worked Really?

160
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:46,405
Rym: Well because it kept the shit heads out because no one would give them invites for the longest time.

161
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:59,650
Scott: Yeah, and it also made it Really interesting for the people running Orca to see how the network was expanding because you knew that Every expansion to the network was a branch off of you know, the guy who started it.

162
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,998
Scott: So there's like this middle dot.

163
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:07,665
Scott: and then you just saw you know Who sent out lots of invites who sent out only a few who didn't send any and

164
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:08,006
Rym: like I

165
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,972
Scott: make this big like chart Of all the

166
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:13,830
Rym: people like I can I think it was Steve Pomeroy who actually gave our group the first invite.

167
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:19,649
Scott: Yeah, because we knew about it and he's like, oh I didn't realize you guys were interested in that when we started talking about it and then he invited all of us.

168
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:36,030
Rym: Yep And then we invited a crazy ton of people and we became huge proponents of it and we would all sit on it like every day Making communities and talking and setting things up Like I made the Otakon community which is still there and we have the RIT anime community, which apparently I still own.

169
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:37,715
Rym: Awesome, whatever.

170
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:41,084
Scott: Yeah, it took me forever to remember my password to this damn thing.

171
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:55,038
Rym: Yeah, so or cut Was ruined or cut Eventually like the Muslim hordes that tried to overrun Europe like the sea peoples the Phil Stines that overran Greece Philistines Phil Stines whatever.

172
00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:10,945
Rym: anyway the Portuguese speaking Brazilians came one day and within the span of not exaggerating within the span of about two weeks Orcutt went from amazing and cool to utterly useless.

173
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:14,901
Scott: It was just dominated Completely by Portuguese Brazilian.

174
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,126
Scott: I got nothing against Brazil.

175
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:20,490
Rym: Brazil's a cool place Yeah And it wasn't even that people who don't speak English were using this thing.

176
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,909
Rym: Yeah, it was set up so that any languages can work and it was really beautiful and unique.

177
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,950
Rym: The Brazilians had no concept of internet etiquette.

178
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:46,672
Rym: they had no concept of not spamming people and basically there was nothing but Brazilian spam of Brazilians trying to trick other people into joining their communities and being their friends so that their numbers would go up so that they can get more people.

179
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:59,488
Scott: it was just craziness and utter chaos just basically like this flood of millions upon millions of Portuguese messages just flooding the system completely filling up every box and they took over every community.

180
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:01,435
Rym: they destroyed Everything.

181
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:04,630
Rym: they broke or cut for a while with the massive amounts of spam.

182
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:13,254
Scott: Yeah Orcutt was real slow for a while and because they were just filling it up with so much shit It was basically vandalism.

183
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:25,512
Rym: and the funny part is I saw a post by a Brazilian who wrote in English and he basically said To any of you who might be thinking that this is cool Don't be.

184
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:29,643
Rym: I can read what these people are saying and this is the bottom of the internet.

185
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,007
Rym: get out get out get out.

186
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:33,615
Rym: And Orcutt.

187
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:36,164
Rym: and just collapsed completely and we all fled.

188
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:37,610
Scott: but Orcutt is still there.

189
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:41,610
Rym: Yeah, not only is it still there but apparently now it's a den of child pornography.

190
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:45,639
Rym: Oh really in Brazil see I had forgotten about Orcutt.

191
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,843
Rym: Orcutt was this wonderful short chapter in my life and I see on slashdot a news story about Orcutt.

192
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:54,170
Rym: I didn't even read the story.

193
00:15:54,230 --> 00:16:01,938
Rym: I thought Orcutt and I went there and I posted the quick story of what happened to Orcutt because it seemed like the people Commenting on whatever the story was.

194
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,290
Rym: I had no idea what Orcutt really was.

195
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:06,650
Rym: They were talking about Google search and they had no idea.

196
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:13,347
Scott: Imagine if myspace existed for about a month and then disappeared because it was just full of crap.

197
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:14,992
Scott: That's what Orcutt is Yep.

198
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,460
Rym: Now the story doesn't really matter.

199
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,383
Rym: I don't care about it.

200
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:32,930
Rym: It was just an excuse to talk about Orcutt, but basically Brazilians were using Orcutt to share child pornography allegedly and the Brazilian government has demanded that Google and Orcutt hand over all of the information to track these people down.

201
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,479
Rym: Google has said fuck you.

202
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:36,725
Rym: We're in America.

203
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,898
Rym: Send us some Legal documents and then we'll talk.

204
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,070
Rym: Yeah, it's about right and I don't know what's gonna happen.

205
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:52,205
Scott: I mean like of course if I was Google I would go through the system cleaning up all the child porn You know, but I wouldn't give information to the Brazilian government unless they had.

206
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:55,101
Rym: I mean if I were Google I would comply with the legal request.

207
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:58,256
Rym: if I got served the real papers I would cooperate 100%.

208
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:04,089
Scott: not just that but even if there are no legal papers, I would go around my little Orcutt You know getting rid of all the child porn.

209
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:14,220
Rym: Yeah the problem it I have with this is that the Brazilians seem to expect Google to cooperate in their investigation without any sort of You know legal process.

210
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:21,480
Rym: Yeah, no matter what they were investigating I mean, I gotta say if a police officer bothers me and tries to get information out of me.

211
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:30,370
Rym: I Warrant or I was seeing a crime happening at that exact moment.

212
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:34,662
Scott: Yeah, I mean the only real time I would give up information to.

213
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:46,915
Scott: well if I saw a guy with a knife Yelling and screaming and laughing maniacally covered in blood running away Well, I was just gonna say if I was a witness to something and then a cop came around and was like, hey Oh, you know you doing.

214
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,323
Rym: there was a story on FARC recently.

215
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:51,873
Rym: That might not always be the best idea Really?

216
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,782
Rym: The story is a guy.

217
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:55,290
Rym: I forget the exact story.

218
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:00,285
Rym: So I'm gonna pull the pendulate thing here and make up a story that has the same basic facts.

219
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:02,050
Rym: Okay crime was committed.

220
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,245
Rym: I think it was a murder or something.

221
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:05,306
Rym: Guy witnesses it.

222
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:09,010
Rym: Guy goes to court like, you know, he's gonna testify.

223
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:16,294
Rym: Judge is afraid that this guy might not appear in court to actually testify for the real trial Orders.

224
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:19,509
Rym: the guy arrested and keeps him in jail until the trial for months.

225
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:29,067
Rym: then due to a clerical error After the trial they didn't let him out and he sat in jail for a long time.

226
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,010
Scott: I heard that story.

227
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:49,410
Rym: finally, he someone fought on his behalf and got him out of jail and I Get the impression that events like this will not have this magnitude happened somewhat regularly in the US for a judge or someone will Detain someone to testify an important case because they're afraid that they might not testify.

228
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:56,130
Scott: Trick is don't go to court until it's testifying time because as soon as you walk into the courtroom they can contempt you.

229
00:18:56,831 --> 00:19:01,710
Rym: Yeah, but they could just put out a warrant and a subpoena and get you anyway, but what are they arresting me for?

230
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,673
Rym: Oh, no, they put him under protective Custodianship or something.

231
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:13,710
Scott: Alright, so all I really have to do is whenever I'm a witness to anything I'll call a lawyer immediately and I say you keep your eye on me.

232
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:16,021
Scott: If anything happens to me, you got to come get my ass out.

233
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,067
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

234
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:23,090
Rym: Yeah I just really it's sad because I'm generally a very law-and-order person, but I don't trust the police at all.

235
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,716
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty.

236
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:25,780
Scott: if I was a witness though.

237
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,390
Scott: I and I wasn't worried about being locked in jail.

238
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:31,269
Rym: Oh, yeah, if it weren't for that I would just I would tell them whatever I saw sure.

239
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:36,788
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz I definitely believe that if someone does something bad you should you know mitigate the damages.

240
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,113
Rym: Yeah Okay.

241
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:39,620
Rym: Anyway, you got some news.

242
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:40,102
Rym: Yep.

243
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:41,428
Scott: So Pluto is.

244
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,860
Scott: Is it a planet or is it not a planet?

245
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:47,630
Rym: Well, no, it is not a planet by the by.

246
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:54,075
Scott: Yeah, well, it really all depends on the definition of planet and for a while on the internet I'd say about a couple years now.

247
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:56,845
Scott: It's been a very large point of contention.

248
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:58,330
Scott: What exactly constitute a planet?

249
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,769
Scott: What should constitute a planet etcetera, etcetera?

250
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:16,510
Rym: I never made the song but I have this little sample here that I may or may not have added into what I'm just saying right now in post-production, but Rym doesn't give one shit about whether or not Pluto is a planet because Pluto is still there regardless of what I call it

251
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:18,432
Scott: Yeah, really I mean the.

252
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:28,010
Scott: the way the solar system is constructed and what rocks are floating around in it and where they float is not affected by the names we choose to apply to those rocks.

253
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:38,330
Scott: so anyway, some people seem to care about what's a planet and what's not and It seems that their largest concern is elementary school textbooks.

254
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,739
Rym: Now that is the student.

255
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:50,270
Rym: if a teacher can't deal with telling their students This book is somewhat out-of-date children and Pluto is not actually a planet because of blah blah blah blah.

256
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,336
Rym: They can't handle that.

257
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:53,181
Rym: They shouldn't be a teacher.

258
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:54,146
Rym: Good God.

259
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:54,246
Rym: Yeah.

260
00:20:54,326 --> 00:21:02,590
Scott: Yeah I think what it is is just that's you know, a whole nother show about how Adults, you know underestimate children and treat them like children.

261
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,639
Rym: I think it's also that's why they're children.

262
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:07,270
Scott: if you treated them like adults, then they would become adults much quicker.

263
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:17,590
Rym: I think it's also a show about how when people To want to resist change, they'll just look for anything they can to complain about whenever change comes.

264
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:22,670
Rym: Yep, I mean that is an asinine complaint and I don't know what they think.

265
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,837
Rym: They think the the committee is gonna say, you know what?

266
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:29,212
Rym: All right for the elementary school students Pluto is a planet Mm-hmm.

267
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:30,736
Rym: What the hell anyway.

268
00:21:30,796 --> 00:21:38,441
Scott: here I'm gonna read this paragraph of stuff so that you can get the full facts of this debacle into your brain.

269
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:42,139
Scott: a Planet is a celestial body.

270
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,547
Scott: That is an orbit around the Sun.

271
00:21:44,748 --> 00:21:59,290
Scott: check as sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium Nearly round shape check I believe and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.

272
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:02,149
Rym: Pluto hasn't done that.

273
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,555
Rym: Pluto's too little.

274
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,121
Rym: it didn't do that.

275
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:17,468
Scott: a dwarf planet is a celestial body that is in orbit around the Sun check has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round shape.

276
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:22,070
Scott: Oh man has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit and is not a satellite.

277
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:26,570
Rym: Alright, so the moon now is not going to be considered a planet like some people feared.

278
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:28,519
Scott: No, the moon is a satellite.

279
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:29,061
Scott: Therefore.

280
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,890
Scott: It is not a planet nor dwarf planet.

281
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:35,656
Scott: And you know, the real thing here is that You know, you had to clear.

282
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:39,650
Scott: you can't just clear, you know, the neighborhood around where you are.

283
00:22:39,831 --> 00:22:41,670
Scott: You have to clear your orbit.

284
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:51,579
Scott: So, you know you take the orbit of the earth and you draw this big circle on the star map or whatever and you say Hey, is there any shit floating around in the orbit of Earth?

285
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:55,110
Scott: Oh, no, there's no shit floating around in the orbit of Earth.

286
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,398
Scott: Well, then Earth has cleared its orbit.

287
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:03,915
Scott: you look at Pluto and you look at Pluto's orbit and you say hey Wait a minute Neptune is in Pluto's orbit.

288
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:14,770
Scott: Pluto has not cleared its orbit and the moon, you know Someone might say oh the moon is a planet because you know, the definition of planet doesn't discount satellites.

289
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:21,370
Scott: But the moon has not cleared its orbit of I don't know the earth which is kind of in the way.

290
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:23,079
Scott: So well the thing is.

291
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,310
Rym: I'd also read that there's a chance The moon is going to eventually escape earth and kind of become a free-roaming body.

292
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:48,793
Scott: That could happen and apparently I read in some places that certain astro scientists of various sorts believe the moon and the earth to actually be two planets sort of Switching places and orbiting each other in a duality, you know Well by the by.

293
00:23:48,813 --> 00:23:53,990
Rym: I'm sure Lara will if she listens to GeekNights tonight will probably correct us on something we've said.

294
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:58,869
Scott: Yeah, I know that she's the only person we know that knows anything about Astro whatnots?

295
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,315
Rym: Astro whatnots?

296
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,561
Scott: that shows you how much we know.

297
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:04,067
Rym: she can tell us about the kajigger.

298
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:06,674
Scott: Yep The kajigger in the flying rocks in space.

299
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,599
Rym: Oh Man, speaking of space.

Rym: Yes, well, I can't believe we forgot to use it during classic week.

315
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:10,710
Rym: Well classic two weeks, basically Yeah, this is just an old flash video from God like five years ago.

316
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,569
Scott: It's really just a flash music video to this song.

317
00:25:14,374 --> 00:25:23,307
Rym: if you've ever seen the words peck chewy um, or Ever heard anything about the terrible secret of space and you wondered what the hell that was.

318
00:25:23,427 --> 00:25:24,130
Rym: Here's your answer.

319
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:28,242
Scott: I'm not exactly sure if this is really the origin of pack chewy.

320
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:34,861
Rym: Um, well, all I have to say is that this is where Most people would know it from if they know where it's from at all.

321
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:41,845
Scott: Yeah, if you search for peck chewy, um on Google guess where it takes you the terrible secret of space.

322
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:42,729
Scott: Yeah, that's what that's.

323
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,657
Rym: well I mean space has a terrible power.

324
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:45,541
Scott: It does indeed.

325
00:25:45,802 --> 00:25:46,505
Rym: Yeah by the by.

326
00:25:46,526 --> 00:25:46,847
Rym: Mm-hmm.

327
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:51,200
Scott: Okay, so I saw this thing on the internet this morning.

328
00:25:51,661 --> 00:26:03,231
Scott: God, this is great and it just it's some guys watching the Pokemon movie now and Okay Okay.

329
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,615
Scott: Yeah pack pack chewy.

330
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:05,900
Scott: Um, that's where a pack chewy.

331
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,810
Scott: Um for originated at least according to the Urban Dictionary.

332
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:11,300
Scott: It is the Urban Dictionary says pack chewy.

333
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:12,345
Scott: Um question.

334
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:13,550
Scott: Do you have stairs in your house?

335
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,490
Rym: The thing is I've never heard pack chewy on other than in reference to that or from someone who didn't know what it was.

336
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,361
Scott: I think I saw a t-shirt that should have packed chewy.

337
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:21,804
Scott: Um fun it.

338
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:22,730
Rym: I've seen that a lot.

339
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,944
Rym: I assumed it was to the shover pusher robots.

340
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:29,299
Scott: Oh anyway so Back to this Pokemon movie.

341
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,309
Scott: There's a video here of two guys.

342
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:35,464
Scott: They seem to be New York North New Jersey type guys, maybe Brooklyn guys.

343
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:39,460
Scott: Yeah, I get the definite impression of Brooklyn Yeah, and they're watching a Pokemon movie.

344
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,595
Scott: I think it might be the second or third one It looks like because it has.

345
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:44,042
Rym: that was that the 48th one.

346
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,850
Rym: There's so many freaking Pokemon movies.

347
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:53,490
Scott: I don't know that much about Pokemon movies But I know quite a bit about the original the first two sets of Pokemon games because I played him.

348
00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:02,070
Scott: I played Pokemon red and Pokemon silver and I know about Pokemon adventures the excellent manga that everyone should read Which is the only Pokemon really worth reading.

349
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:09,070
Scott: Anyway, these guys are watching a Pokemon movie and this one guy starts going off about how Snorlax is freaking awesome.

350
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,938
Scott: I mean, he's like look at Snorlax.

351
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:13,530
Scott: He's holding ten Pokemon without Snorlax.

352
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:14,553
Scott: They'd be screwed.

353
00:27:14,573 --> 00:27:15,476
Scott: Snorlax owns you.

354
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:17,041
Rym: Snorlax is fucking ripped.

355
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,726
Scott: Look Snorlax is huge.

356
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:19,770
Scott: He's more ripped than you.

357
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,278
Scott: Hold ten Pokemon get out of here.

358
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:23,160
Scott: You don't know nothing.

359
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:24,384
Scott: It's not right.

360
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:25,307
Scott: you speak at you.

361
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:26,130
Scott: What do you know?

362
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,999
Rym: While we generally don't speak that way.

363
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:33,130
Rym: I mean we're like that but we're not that much like that.

364
00:27:33,371 --> 00:27:36,264
Rym: Yeah, it is not a representation of what the front row crew is like.

365
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:39,901
Scott: Yeah, we are much more Articulate erudite erudite.

366
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:41,067
Scott: That's the word that.

367
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:44,842
Scott: however Listening to these guys, you know go off.

368
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:46,550
Scott: It's like yeah, those are my people.

369
00:27:47,212 --> 00:28:02,726
Rym: Yeah, honestly, I would say that in terms I mean because anime world order always talks about how different you know the geek community is and the anime community is down in like Florida and everything and RIT where we became full geeks when we ascended to.

370
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:05,453
Rym: like alpha geekery We have.

371
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:08,809
Rym: we realized now that it is one of the geekiest places in the world.

372
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:10,112
Scott: Yeah Just about.

373
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:23,102
Rym: and I would say that the average dorm room or the average Apartment in RIT that wasn't full of drunk frat guys who were the other half of RIT Was full of people exactly like that video.

374
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:29,407
Scott: Yeah, I mean we used to go over and Play Mario Party with some friends quite a quite a few.

375
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:30,010
Rym: Oh my god.

376
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,563
Rym: Once again, I'll reference but not speak of the bamboo story.

377
00:28:33,683 --> 00:28:40,007
Scott: Yes, but when we were there, you know We had schtick just like this like, you know, that's where my vision comes from.

378
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:40,690
Rym: I have a vision.

379
00:28:40,912 --> 00:28:45,962
Scott: Yeah, I have a vision of a row You know and we would let's think of some other stuff ahead of it.

380
00:28:46,003 --> 00:28:46,464
Scott: Oh, that's right.

381
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:53,750
Scott: whenever DK showed up We'd be like DK and we had a little DK like figurine and stuff and we had a stick going on with that.

382
00:28:54,272 --> 00:29:03,930
Scott: And there was another stick where you know when you get in Mario Party when you're about to play a minigame It shows you like a few minigames, you know to choose from and obviously it picks randomly.

383
00:29:04,372 --> 00:29:10,530
Scott: but we would call out what game we wanted to play right and Very often it would land on the game.

384
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:14,543
Scott: We called out and we were like is the microphone the magic microphone and it?

385
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:16,670
Scott: because we didn't actually have the game cube microphone yet.

386
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,186
Scott: This is Mario Party 4 and I think the microphone came out at Mario Party 6 or 7.

387
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:23,529
Rym: Yep There was also the championship belts.

388
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:27,050
Scott: Yeah, we had W to have championship belts to give to the winners and stuff.

389
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,658
Scott: But you know we it was basically watching us play.

390
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:33,770
Scott: Mario Party is exactly the same as those guys play watching the Pokemon movie.

391
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:37,089
Rym: Yeah, I got to say Mario Party we and Wario where we?

392
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:42,726
Rym: I think we're gonna have to buy a front row crew GeekNights world.

393
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:47,560
Scott: Well, wwwf We WWE no, no notice.

394
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,715
Rym: I said wwwf Geeks, that's right.

395
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:52,278
Scott: Yeah.

396
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:55,432
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna need some championship belts for that shit I got.

397
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:59,170
Scott: why don't we just go to hot topic and get one of those belts that has an NES controller for the buckle?

398
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:01,082
Rym: That would probably be perfect.

399
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:03,085
Scott: Yeah, let's get one of those I think we're gonna have to.

400
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:05,698
Scott: that way We don't give money to the stupid pro wrestling crap.

401
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:08,146
Rym: and we've said it often and we'll say it again.

402
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:17,266
Rym: There's a story about while wheel and whoa Competition the championship belts and most importantly the vision and bamboo.

403
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:17,908
Rym: Yes.

404
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:18,610
Rym: I have a vision.

405
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:22,386
Rym: I have a vision of us telling the story of bamboo, but not tonight.

406
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:23,250
Scott: No, not tonight.

407
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:28,266
Scott: You'll be kept in suspense for all eternity until you hear the story of the bamboo.

408
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:29,450
Rym: Good God the bamboo.

409
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:34,487
Rym: Good guy the bamboo is probably worse than being shot in the face with the clown pistol.

410
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:38,450
Scott: You kidding I would take 30 clown pistols at point-blank before.

411
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:40,696
Rym: I'll be very blunt.

412
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:45,590
Rym: The bamboo was one of the worst things that has ever happened to me in my life.

413
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:49,754
Scott: That's you know, that's a pretty good life at the bamboo I don't know.

414
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:56,310
Rym: I still I would trade getting like shot just a little bit instead of having to ever deal with that bamboo again.

415
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:57,395
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

416
00:30:57,937 --> 00:31:01,452

Rym: Well, we talked about it briefly way Way back in one of the earliest episodes of you.

435
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:55,649
Scott: I think those episodes might actually dropped out of the feed.

436
00:31:56,391 --> 00:31:57,134
Scott: Well, that's so old.

437
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:57,597
Rym: Yeah.

438
00:31:57,617 --> 00:32:00,370
Rym: Well, we can't have the feed be longer than that or feed burner will choke on it.

439
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:05,748
Scott: Yeah, oh and just so you know if Every episode of GeekNights you can still find it at front row crew.

440
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:11,573
Rym: calm Yes, all the way back to our inaugural episode on October 31st 2005.

441
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:11,954
Scott: take note.

442
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:15,630
Rym: In fact, that is generally when we change up seasons and GeekNights.

443
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,395
Rym: But we're gonna.

444
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,065
Scott: we're gonna more on that in the future.

445
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:18,387
Scott: We might.

446
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:20,296
Scott: yeah I got some ideas about what we.

447
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:23,349
Rym: there are also about 11 episodes from before.

448
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:27,790
Rym: then That will eventually be released to people who aren't cool enough to find them on their own as bonus content.

449
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,943
Rym: But the done even though you probably don't actually want to listen to them.

450
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:31,485
Scott: No, you don't.

451
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:49,430
Scott: Okay, so front row crew I was a dude and I went to high school in Connecticut and then after high school I went on this trip to Israel for 28 days and then I came back and then I went to the Rochester Institute of Technology.

452
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:53,546
Rym: So I was a child and I grew was born in Detroit, Michigan.

453
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:54,550
Rym: I went to school in Michigan.

454
00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:00,882
Rym: I lived my whole life in Michigan and then on a pretty much total whim I decided to go to RIT.

455
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:07,589
Rym: and when I say total whim I mean I can do an episode about how I pretty much completely randomly chose to go to RIT.

456
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:13,270
Scott: Okay, so I'm at RIT and I have some kind of roommate guy and he likes soccer a lot.

457
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:15,143
Scott: You know, he's a normal cool guy.

458
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:16,050
Scott: I got nothing against him.

459
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,870
Scott: But you know, he's not a super geek.

460
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:22,190
Scott: So we don't have too much in common other than you know things that every guy has in common.

461
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:23,414
Rym: I have a roommate.

462
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,104
Rym: I don't even remember his name because I'd never talked to him.

463
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,910
Rym: He was completely uninteresting to me.

464
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,569
Rym: We had nothing in common and we pretty much ignored each other.

465
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:34,490
Scott: I only remember my roommates name because it was slightly strange.

466
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:39,089
Scott: His real name was Robert, but everyone called him Tom, but he spelled his name.

467
00:33:40,631 --> 00:33:49,922
Rym: That's kind of common because my middle name is Tom ass, you know Thomas and Thomas is spelled th om a s. Okay, so that's why a lot of people spell Tom th om.

468
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:51,146
Scott: All right, that's fun.

469
00:33:51,808 --> 00:34:01,188
Scott: But anyway And I'm at this college and I'm going to classes doing my thing and you know I'm looking for some friends and you know looking to get with the geeks.

470
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:11,509
Scott: and the first place I go to get with the geeks is The two most obvious places to go the gaming club and the anime club.

471
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:14,030
Rym: I Do the same though?

472
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:26,370
Rym: I did not go to one of the early meetings of the anime club because I had Due to RIT's random freshman scheduling a class that was four hours long during the anime club that I promptly dropped.

473
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:28,016
Scott: Yeah, well, I went to the very.

474
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:33,534
Scott: the first thing I went to was the very first anime club meeting at which I met Luke Yep, now all of us.

475
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:35,521
Scott: he was greeting pretty much everyone who came in.

476
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:43,570
Rym: now pretty much most of the front row crew at least the Core original front row crew were all at this particular meeting of the anime club, but we didn't know each other.

477
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:52,996
Scott: I mean if you go back basically like I didn't really you know Make any friends at that first meeting even though I talked to a bunch of people, you know I went back to my dorm alone after the meeting.

478
00:34:53,016 --> 00:34:56,610
Scott: Yep, but I definitely had a good time watching some anime there.

479
00:34:56,831 --> 00:35:09,810
Rym: I went with my friend Ken who came to RIT with me from our high school And I mean if you would go back like, you know anime flashback and it shows like the room in Black and white like the past and all of us sitting in this big room and this huge sea of people.

480
00:35:10,572 --> 00:35:16,170
Rym: You can all the front row crew people have like those halos around them because destiny is about to bring them together.

481
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,567
Scott: So it's Tuesday and it's time for the gaming club.

482
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:22,310
Scott: And what do I do?

483
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,710
Scott: I show up and I'm like, oh there's a gaming club.

484
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:33,130
Scott: I bet someone there wants to play battle tech with me, which is a game I had and loved and did not get many chances to play.

485
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:43,030
Scott: So I had my little battle tech box and I walk over the gaming club and I'm standing around Talking to some scary gamer types, you know, and there's this guy Katsu there and he's got this.

486
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,842
Scott: You know, he's an Asian dude, and he's got the umbrella.

487
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:47,670
Scott: He's got this Japanese style umbrella.

488
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,493
Scott: it's pretty cool.

489
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:52,249
Scott: and he's talking about battle tech with me and I'm like, okay a dude, what's up?

490
00:35:52,269 --> 00:36:05,900
Scott: and Then you know, there's a whole bunch of other people there I'm not really talking to kind of talking to whatever and this guy comes out and he says I'm running a Dungeons & Dragons third edition campaign.

491
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,370
Scott: And the first thing my brain says is third edition.

492
00:36:10,372 --> 00:36:12,083
Scott: I didn't know there was a third edition.

493
00:36:12,224 --> 00:36:19,370
Rym: Yeah now granted I've been playing third edition for a while already not a while But I've been playing it a little bit just because it came out pretty much right before I went to college.

494
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:21,762
Rym: So I thought awesome.

495
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:23,510
Rym: I'm gonna get to play D&D again.

496
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,810
Rym: My life will not change in any significant way because D&D was a big part of my high school life.

497
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:35,843
Scott: yep, and immediately I go over to this guy and I'm like I'm in and a whole bunch of other people come and say they're in a lot of people like 20 people now.

498
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:52,367
Rym: of the 20 people One of them I ended up dating not the other nine baited into the background because they were worthless or at least uninteresting and Everyone else pretty much immediately became the group of friends.

499
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:55,929
Rym: We didn't have a name We didn't even really recognize that we were a group of friends.

500
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:59,067
Rym: yet It happened so kind of gradually and unnoticedly.

501
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:01,573
Scott: Yep well I think what really Did?

502
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:06,576
Scott: it is like I was sitting there and I didn't know how to make a third ed character or anything and the only ones had players handbooks.

503
00:37:06,637 --> 00:37:12,459
Scott: there were very few of them going around the table and We didn't have cars or anything so couldn't exactly go get more.

504
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:13,683
Scott: and we didn't have money either.

505
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:14,565
Scott: being freshmen.

506
00:37:15,689 --> 00:37:18,930
Scott: and you know There was Ken and Rym and they had players handbooks.

507
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,606
Scott: So I was you know mooching off of them and asking them questions because they knew what was going on.

508
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:25,018
Rym: now Ken and I We met this this kid.

509
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:27,150
Rym: we didn't know his name and he was kind of cool.

510
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:35,158
Rym: He was a little uh little tactless little rude, but rude and in the you know Kind of way we like like the cool asshole kind of rude.

511
00:37:35,198 --> 00:37:35,720
Rym: That's right.

512
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:45,581
Rym: So so he was also noticeably Jewish Like it was kind of I mean it really came off strong.

513
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:49,090
Rym: so for a while we called him that super Jew guy.

514
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,560
Scott: I thought you got me the pimpin Jew.

515
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,929
Rym: We called you the pimpin Jew as well.

516
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:54,667
Rym: Okay, you were something Jew every time.

517
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:55,190
Rym: All right.

518
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:04,262
Rym: So we'd see it like I'd see him walking around cabs be like, hey, it's that guy yep,

519
00:38:04,763 --> 00:38:15,070
Scott: and then you know one day at Gracie's which is a place where freshmen eat at RIT I saw Rym and Ken sitting at a table and I didn't even know they were Rym and like what their names were.

520
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,829
Rym: And yeah, none of us knew any of our names.

521
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,950
Scott: Yeah So I just kind of walk up to them to their table with my tray after I was done eating and they were still eating.

522
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,383
Rym: And I said, hey, and I was thinking all right.

523
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,774
Rym: I think I have a friend in college now Yeah I think we're huh.

524
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:30,319
Rym: and then over time like.

525
00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:32,326
Scott: and then I said hey and they were like hey.

526
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:35,882
Scott: and then I just kind of Shrugged and walked away because I didn't have anything else to say to these.

527
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:36,685
Scott: complete stranger.

528
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:39,466
Rym: Yeah but over time like we kept.

529
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:54,810
Rym: eventually it started to coalesce that bigger and bigger groups of us ended up bumping into each other at Gracie's and Eventually we started eating together kind of by chance because before I would either eat with Ken Or I'd eat alone or I ate with people from my floor.

530
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:57,141
Rym: But I really didn't like any of the people from my.

531
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,830
Scott: yeah, I think I ate with my roommate twice.

532
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:02,790
Rym: They were all kind of drunken scary boring annoying people.

533
00:39:03,111 --> 00:39:18,150
Scott: Yep, so we had this group of people that we played D&D with you know, those of them that were freshmen that ate at Gracie's Yes and attended RIT and eating dinner together at this long table and in addition some new people who weren't playing in the game.

534
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:28,130
Rym: But we met through an anime club and the gaming club started to join and it ended up being Not at any given time, but there were about 20 people who would come and go from these nightly six o'clock dinners.

535
00:39:28,612 --> 00:39:28,934
Scott: Yeah, all right.

536
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:31,990
Scott: Now let's go to the anime club where the stuff really started to go down.

537
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,450
Scott: It was like the gaming club was the starting bit.

538
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,410
Scott: It was sort of like the starter in the car, but the anime club that was like the alternator.

539
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:40,560
Rym: Yeah, because the gaming club all it was great for gaming.

540
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,710
Rym: There was very little unity and a lot of scary people.

541
00:39:42,891 --> 00:39:47,430
Scott: Yep, so at the anime club, it just so happened that a lot of the same people were chilling there, you know.

542
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,215
Scott: So hey, what are you cool?

543
00:39:49,696 --> 00:39:54,709
Scott: So we sat near each other at the anime club and we sat near each other in the front row.

544
00:39:55,332 --> 00:40:09,910
Rym: For some reason we'd always sit in the front front front row and then we always made jokes about the back row people because Anyone who didn't get to the club early enough who was in our now growing friend group was forced to sit in the second row.

545
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:18,250
Scott: So they were losers, obviously Yeah, we would get to club mad early and fill the front row and we would harass the eboard and he harassed the people around us.

546
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:22,730
Scott: Yep, we'd yell out shit and be generally rude and hilarious.

547
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:32,312
Rym: I mean it got to the point where what we'd all show up to club like clubs Club opened at 7 like that was when the room opened and club didn't start until 8.

548
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:35,910
Rym: But as far as we were concerned club started at 7, that's right.

549
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:39,130
Rym: So we'd show up kind of take over the room and make all sorts of mischief.

550
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:42,403
Rym: The eboard was always like why are you guys always here so early?

551
00:40:42,443 --> 00:40:44,210
Rym: Don't you have anything better to do like homework?

552
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:44,868
Rym: And we were like what?

553
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:48,977
Rym: Yeah, pretty much none of us ever did schoolwork.

554
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:49,960
Scott: No, we did not.

555
00:40:50,502 --> 00:40:52,850
Scott: Yeah, look at us now highly paid technology professionals.

556
00:40:53,315 --> 00:40:54,123
Rym: I wonder how that happened.

557
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:56,612
Scott: Take that homework All right.

558
00:40:56,813 --> 00:41:01,287
Rym: Yeah, I should go back and explain to all my professors that my no homework policy worked just fine for me.

559
00:41:01,307 --> 00:41:11,274
Scott: Yep Anyway, so, you know, I don't know where we actually decided to call ourselves the front row crew but long before we Self-identified as this.

560
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:16,770
Rym: the executive board of the anime club called us those front row guys and eventually the front row crew.

561
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:23,597
Scott: Yeah, they generally disliked us and they think that one point they wanted to get rid of us and kick us out of the club Or something.

562
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:24,063
Scott: I don't know.

563
00:41:24,144 --> 00:41:24,610
Scott: I don't care.

564
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:33,183
Rym: Yeah The problem with that was that we were a big part of the club at that point because us and our extended group of friends Comprised a good quarter of the people in that room.

565
00:41:33,203 --> 00:41:33,465
Rym: Yeah.

566
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:33,867
Scott: Yeah.

567
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:40,687
Scott: Yeah Generally what happened is like early on in our in the life of the front row crew like at.

568
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:53,993
Scott: we just go to anime club together and then we would just walk back to the dorms talking along the way in a group and Then we would just kind of stand in a group talking outside the dorms until there wasn't much more to say and then we go Back to our rooms.

569
00:41:54,154 --> 00:42:07,930
Rym: Yep, and the group would slowly whittle down and a lot of times ended up being me and Sometimes Katsu or Ken and this fuzzy haired guy who joined kind of later Like he didn't go to the same clubs as us, but we always saw him cuz he had this fuzzy curly hair.

570
00:42:08,273 --> 00:42:09,384
Rym: Yeah, we called him Trotsky.

571
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:11,580
Scott: Yep But he was.

572
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:12,229
Scott: that's Greg.

573
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:18,770
Rym: Yeah They'd always ended up being like a few of us talking for like another hour after everyone else went upstairs or whatever their building was.

574
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:19,171
Scott: Yep.

575
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:21,360
Scott: Now one day I was walking back to my dorm.

576
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,833
Scott: now the dorm I lived in was different than everyone else's and that it Was unrenovated.

577
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:25,936
Scott: it was bigger.

578
00:42:25,956 --> 00:42:27,100
Scott: It had bigger rooms.

579
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:32,062
Scott: It had nicer lounges, even though it was on renovate Bigger lounges.

580
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,130
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

581
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:40,450
Scott: And most of all it was drugs and alcohol-free dorm, which means there weren't drunk guys vomiting in the hallways and shit.

582
00:42:40,617 --> 00:42:41,853
Rym: Yes as opposed to fish.

583
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:43,698
Rym: be where I live where we.

584
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:49,514
Rym: the slogan was we drink like fish if you if you can understand the Clever clever humor.

585
00:42:49,554 --> 00:42:56,923
Scott: Yep, and also the RA of my dorm DJ was the coolest dude in the RIT dorms.

586
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:04,570
Scott: Meanwhile, no my city of God reference my RA there is a quite a story about it was the student council president.

587
00:43:05,032 --> 00:43:06,036
Rym: Yeah, but not then.

588
00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:09,149
Rym: he was just the RA who hired strippers for the floor.

589
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:13,543
Scott: Awesome, and then no wonder he became the student council president the year after.

590
00:43:13,563 --> 00:43:15,770
Rym: yeah, that's a whole other episode.

591
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,075
Scott: He was an okay guy though.

592
00:43:17,235 --> 00:43:20,367
Rym: Yeah, except he got power and then he squandered it.

593
00:43:20,488 --> 00:43:25,210
Scott: That's right I thought because I think he realized that he was in a position of meaningless power.

594
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:28,850
Scott: He had power over things that didn't matter in the grand scope.

595
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:34,025
Scott: So he had no problem using them for personal and pretty much just bought pizza for his friends.

596
00:43:34,266 --> 00:43:34,527
Scott: Yep.

597
00:43:34,747 --> 00:43:35,189
Scott: That's cool.

598
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:35,650
Scott: That's cool.

599
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:49,386
Scott: Anyway, so the dorm that I walked back to that fuzzy haired guy Greg when I walked back to it He just he was walking with me the whole way and I was like, wait a minute You live in the same dorm on the same floor as me and just in a different room.

600
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:50,530
Scott: What the hell?

601
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:50,792
Scott: How come?

602
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:52,510
Scott: I had never seen you here before and he's like, huh?

603
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:55,553
Scott: Yeah And that.

604
00:43:55,593 --> 00:43:56,517
Scott: and then I continued.

605
00:43:56,537 --> 00:44:00,862
Scott: I pretty much bothered him all year whenever I would just go down the hallway knock on his door And bother him a lot.

606
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:04,809
Rym: Yep Now also two of the other really core core people of the crew were Pete and Alex.

607
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:08,749
Scott: Yeah, they were two guys who were in the D&D game and Alex is downstairs right now.

608
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,850
Rym: And yeah, he's Calyx is currently living with us until he finds an apartment in Poughkeepsie or Beacon.

609
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:21,506
Scott: Yeah, and Pete is around somewhere and you know, they were both in the D&D game and you know We kind of we were making friends with them pretty well and we didn't realize it.

610
00:44:21,546 --> 00:44:22,410
Scott: Hey, they were roommates.

611
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,701
Scott: Just by random chance Pete and Alex were roommates.

612
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:30,641
Scott: two pretty similarly minded guys Just happened to be put together by RIT.

613
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:31,264
Scott: What do you know?

614
00:44:31,284 --> 00:44:33,642
Scott: and so they were hanging out with us.

615
00:44:33,662 --> 00:44:42,178
Scott: and Eventually, what happened is instead of standing outside by the dorms then walking back to our rooms We'd all go back to my room have an orgy.

616
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:50,129
Scott: No, we all went back to my Floor in my dorm and go to that lounge there because no one was ever in it.

617
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:54,103
Scott: We'd go back to the Peterson 3 lounge and hang out there.

618
00:44:54,525 --> 00:45:05,970
Rym: now as time went on Now the crew got big bigger and bigger and bigger and it wasn't really called the crew It was just this huge group of like 30 people in all who we all knew and it was this kind of social group.

619
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:17,670
Rym: but then as time continued there was definitely a sort of consolidation and The crew itself the front row crew formed and it was actually a small very close-knit group.

620
00:45:18,071 --> 00:45:24,550
Rym: And then we had the periphery which we knew and basically we never progressed beyond the stage of stand outside and talk with the periphery.

621
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,810
Scott: Yeah, it was like there are people who were like friends of the crew.

622
00:45:27,971 --> 00:45:30,969
Scott: But then there was the core and the core didn't change much.

623
00:45:31,331 --> 00:45:48,962
Rym: It got to the point with the core where we would on a weekend end up in Peterson 3 pretty much Expectedly like we would all expect that everyone would be in Peterson 3 at some point on Friday and we'd stay there until 1158. then we'd run to the corner whore the corner store.

624
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:52,290
Rym: Yeah, I forget that I can't use all those RIT isms.

625
00:45:52,551 --> 00:46:00,788
Rym: I know I know and then we'd you know buy Red Baron for cheese pizzas before they closed at midnight And we'd go back and eat him and then we'd hang out for like another couple hours.

626
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,983
Scott: Generally what happened on an average day a week on the average weekday?

627
00:46:05,204 --> 00:46:07,070
Scott: if it was Monday Wednesday or Friday?

628
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:17,423
Scott: Well Monday Wednesday, which are the non club days because gaming club was on Tuesday and anime club was on Thursday We would just you know, go about our daily business at dinner.

629
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:19,790
Scott: Everyone would be dinner generally the same time.

630
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:28,189
Scott: Yeah between 6 and 7 we'd all just kind of filter into Gracie's sitting at the same big table And then that whole table would finish eating and go to Peterson 3 and then go to bed.

631
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:32,910
Rym: Yep Now the thing is staying like we'd hang out and it started out, you know around 11.

632
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:37,062
Rym: We'd all go to bed and then midnight and then 1 and then 3.

633
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:42,819
Rym: I got to the point where like it'd be like 4 In the morning and I'd be like I got class at 8.

634
00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:45,448
Rym: I should leave it within an hour or so.

635
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:47,920
Rym: Yeah It got really bad.

636
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:48,989
Rym: We didn't sleep at all

637
00:46:49,491 --> 00:47:01,607
Scott: Yeah, and then on Tuesdays we'd go to the gaming club, which was basically at you know right after the Gracie's we went to the gaming club and we would game and game and game and play D&D and then after D&D we'd go to Applebee's

638
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,838
Rym: and Get the half-off appetizers at

639
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:09,850

640
00:47:10,373 --> 00:47:13,175
Scott: eventually Thursdays, it was a similar thing.

641
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:14,360
Scott: We'd go to anime club.

642
00:47:14,661 --> 00:47:17,130
Scott: then we might or might not eat out at Jay's diner.

643
00:47:17,332 --> 00:47:28,018
Scott: We usually add out of Jay's as long as we had money Yep, and then we went back to Peters and three and hung out and this is all freshman year, by the way now weekends Consisted of utter chaos.

673
00:49:19,502 --> 00:49:21,110
Scott: Yeah, we sat in there and talked and hung out.

674
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,816

00:49:22,956 --> 00:49:26,870
Scott: Oh and most of all we played fucking battle tech fucking goddamn.

676
00:49:27,274 --> 00:49:33,747
Rym: We used to break into other places to play battle tech because they had nicer tables or just because we were bored.

677
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:40,670
Rym: like a lot of times if we Ran out of anything to do or if we were just talking we'd serve wandering around campus and we'd talk while we wander.

678
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:46,719
Rym: but it was just like we were sitting in the dorms who's happened to be walking around and The moment we found an unsecured conference room.

679
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,350
Rym: That was when the battle tech got broken up and whatever that room was.

680
00:49:49,537 --> 00:50:01,868
Scott: Yeah We played a battle tech for hours and hours and hours and always crazy stuff happened like the quad legged mech that wouldn't die Yeah, or the pristine mech that got hit in the head with the Gauss rifle and blew up.

681
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:06,069
Scott: Yeah Yep, all that kind of crazy awesomeness that battle tech brings with it.

682
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:12,130
Rym: So in addition to all that in Peterson 3 remember I said we did schoolwork between 10 and 4 Monday through Thursday.

683
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:15,573
Rym: We did something else during that time and that was play Counter-strike.

684
00:50:15,873 --> 00:50:32,238
Rym: lots of counter-strike pretty much any moment and then tribes 2 and then when tribes 2 died Counter-strike again any moment where we were not in a class that we could not skip Hanging out with everyone or sleeping.

685
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:35,407
Rym: We were playing counter-strike or tribes 2.

686
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:39,356
Scott: Yep That was a good freshman year.

687
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:40,842
Scott: That was just freshman year.

688
00:50:40,882 --> 00:50:42,870
Scott: Wait till you hear what happens the rest of the years of college.

689
00:50:42,991 --> 00:50:45,229
Rym: God, we'll have to do separate shows about all the head.

690
00:50:45,435 --> 00:50:57,490
Scott: Yep The point of it is the front row crew is a group of awesome people who met Freshman year at the Rochester Institute of Technology and Remained awesome and together until today.

691
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:02,707
Rym: I mean, it's honestly to not we we all consider each other family at this point.

692
00:51:02,947 --> 00:51:06,823
Rym: Yeah, pretty much I mean I consider the crew to be no different than my blood relatives.

693
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:17,250
Scott: Yep, and front row crew comm is a website that Will host the exploits of the entire front row crew not just GeekNights.

694
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:22,850
Rym: Hopefully, I mean eventually if if other people start making awesome things and not being shit talkers, huh?

695
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:27,557
Rym: They're gonna be all sorts of something.

Scott: Yeah if someone were to make say another podcast or a webcomic in the front row crew or if we were to open front row crew Studios actually got to making some anime music videos those would be you know at like studios.

699
00:51:44,845 --> 00:51:46,089
Scott: dot front row crew comm.

700
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:57,090
Scott: you know GeekNights is just the premier central deal right now But hopefully we will expand in the somewhat distant future as we get our shit together.

701
00:51:57,412 --> 00:52:05,130
Rym: Yep, but I mean in college though I mean, it wasn't just the fact that we became such close friends that we all had very very similar interests.

702
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:07,721
Rym: I mean, we were all fans of HP Lovecraft.

703
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,027
Rym: We were all fans of anime.

704
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:09,670
Rym: We were all fans.

705
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:14,290
Scott: I actually didn't know what HP Lovecraft was till everyone told me but then I became a fan of it.

706
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:19,689
Rym: There was a point at which you read Call of Cthulhu to all the freshmen when we were seniors.

707
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:22,220
Scott: Yeah, well, there were other people there too.

708
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:24,270
Scott: Yeah, I didn't finish reading it either.

709
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:25,030
Scott: Everyone fell asleep.

710
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:33,685
Rym: But we were also a group of people that as our extended crew Pretty much put all of our effort into hanging out and having fun with friends.

711
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:35,290
Scott: And what do we do today?

712
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,650
Rym: We hang out and have fun with friends.

713
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,055
Scott: We got them.

714
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:44,774
Rym: it is not a lie to say that we put more effort into Hanging out.

715
00:52:45,136 --> 00:52:47,987
Rym: then we put into all of our schoolwork combined.

716
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:56,045
Scott: Yeah, and We all we do today is we go to big-ass Conventions and hang out and we try to find new people to hang out with.

717
00:52:56,126 --> 00:52:57,533
Scott: and we hang out with the old people I mean.

718
00:52:57,857 --> 00:52:59,050
Rym: or GeekNights, what do we do?

719
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:05,770
Rym: We're basically doing the same thing we'd be doing if we were just hanging out without microphones and there was anyone to listen to us.

720
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:14,538
Scott: Yeah I mean if for anyone who stopped by our hotel room at Otakon and for anyone who heard about it You know, there were a lot of freaking people in there.

721
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,150
Scott: That was front row crew all those people.

722
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:20,501
Scott: Yep, and you know you were doing hanging out.

723
00:53:21,224 --> 00:53:23,050
Rym: our lives consists wholly of hanging out.

724
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:26,109
Rym: Everything else is just pursuant to being able to hang out.

725
00:53:26,271 --> 00:53:29,229
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I don't eat I can't hang out cuz I'll be dead.

726
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:31,384
Scott: Yeah, if I want to eat I gotta buy food.

727
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:35,550
Rym: She means I could have a job I gotta make money and a lot of times we will go places and do things.

728
00:53:35,891 --> 00:53:39,649
Rym: But we do these things mostly to give us a new context in which to hang out.

729
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:51,208
Rym: Yep, cuz hanging out in the same context repeatedly as we know from doing it for five or six years I mean like some night we'd want we go to downtown Rochester and wander around at night hanging out.

730
00:53:51,870 --> 00:54:00,709
Rym: or We'd wander around the campus hanging out or we'd bust into the liberal arts building at night Hanging out and every Thursday we hung out in the front row.

731
00:54:01,751 --> 00:54:03,817
Scott: And that made us the front row crew.

732
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:10,129
Rym: so that you now know the terrible secret of our origin We'll have to shove you down the stairs.

733
00:54:10,553 --> 00:54:12,106
Rym: There will be many episodes in the future.

734
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:19,504
Rym: at some point We'd like to get each and every member of the front row crew on it interview them Separately as to what they think the front row crew is and what I think.

735
00:54:19,524 --> 00:54:24,390
Scott: we just get one show with Everyone and then we can just go around and you know introduce everyone.

736
00:54:24,551 --> 00:54:27,141
Scott: So it's sort of be like a cast of characters type of thing.

737
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:30,854
Scott: Yeah, like a who's who in the front row crew I mean, I'm a poet.

738
00:54:30,974 --> 00:54:31,637
Scott: No, I don't know it.

739
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:35,670
Rym: The thing is the front row crew grows, but not quickly at all.

740
00:54:35,991 --> 00:54:38,183
Rym: Yeah, I mean we have a lot of friends.

741
00:54:38,203 --> 00:54:39,490
Rym: There are a lot of people who know us.

742
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:43,004
Rym: I mean if you go to Otakon, it's kind of scary how many people are like, hey Scott.

743
00:54:43,044 --> 00:54:43,506
Rym: Oh my god.

744
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:43,908
Rym: Hey Riff.

745
00:54:43,968 --> 00:54:44,390
Rym: Oh my god.

746
00:54:44,452 --> 00:54:53,770
Rym: Hey we we have a lot of friends but To actually be considered a member of the front row crew that is pretty much a level of total and unmitigated trust.

747
00:54:54,136 --> 00:54:54,849
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

748
00:54:55,311 --> 00:55:01,533
Rym: I mean we people from the crew have an open invite to stay in our house at any time and we don't even think twice About it.

749
00:55:01,955 --> 00:55:04,069
Scott: Yeah, like if someone just showed up, I'd be like, hey, what's up?

750
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,330
Scott: You know, even if they live far away like Texas or something.

751
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:16,450
Rym: Yeah, and we know that if we what we suddenly appeared in, Texas James and Lisa would say hey come in and then we'd probably watch some anime or play a game and then sleep on their floor.

752
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:22,735
Scott: Yeah, but if someone was like an acquaintance and they showed up at the door be like, hey What are you doing here?

753
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:26,327
Scott: Yeah, you know, I might let him in but not just like.

754
00:55:26,347 --> 00:55:27,170
Scott: hey, what's up?

755
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,289
Scott: Yeah, it's like if your mom showed up at the door you open up and go.

756
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:33,989
Scott: hi What's doing, you know, but if some if I showed up at the door, you'd be like, hey, who are you?

757
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:39,342
Scott: It's that borderline that is crossed with the the front row crew.

758
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:44,817
Scott: However, the front row crew does decrease rapidly if Stupid people are cut out right quick.

759
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:48,090
Scott: And everything is is all the stupid people right now are already cut out.

760
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:57,990
Rym: Well the thing is that when remember and I said that the group kind of coalesced and Concentrated and we kind of made the bear like we formed we spontaneously generated social life.

761
00:55:58,332 --> 00:56:08,595
Rym: there was the sea of people that were connected like this giant protein thing and eventually the front row crew came together and formed a cell membrane, yep, and With one exception.

762
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:14,094
Rym: No one has ever left or no longer been considered a part of the front row crew Mm-hmm.

763
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,788
Rym: It really can't happen.

764
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:24,930
Scott: you Yeah, it's like peep, you know anyone who was cut off was basically not all the way in the crew yet They were outside the cell membrane and then we just kind of squirted some toxins at them.

765
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:33,278
Rym: Yeah They were basically a person we hung out with who for whatever reason either wouldn't go away or we just didn't trust or like enough They actually be considered to the crew.

766
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:35,046
Rym: You really have to be awesome in our eyes.

767
00:56:35,126 --> 00:56:46,168
Scott: Yeah, and I are I don't mean me and Scott I mean by everyone in the crew Mm-hmm, and I mean there are plenty of people who are like my friend But everyone else is just an acquaintance to them and you know, we don't see them so much.

768
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:49,922
Rym: Yep I mean we we put a lot of thought into it.

769
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:52,210
Rym: Well, I guess we really don't know.

770
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,039
Scott: It's sort of just a common sense type of thing.

771
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:58,602
Scott: Yeah, now that I think about it It's just common sense and you know who your friends are.

772
00:56:58,642 --> 00:57:00,330
Scott: You don't like think about it logic.

773
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,590
Scott: Well, a lot of people do really yeah, that's kind of freaky.

774
00:57:04,193 --> 00:57:07,990
Rym: I mean look at all the people who like friend and D friend people in my space and then bitch about each other.

775
00:57:08,713 --> 00:57:09,778
Scott: Yeah, we don't have that shit.

776
00:57:09,798 --> 00:57:11,425
Scott: if you're that kind of person you ain't in.

777
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:15,119
Rym: yeah, there's no drama In the crew between crew members ever.

778
00:57:15,259 --> 00:57:18,510
Scott: it goes with my you know, theory of stupidity and drama.

779
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,400
Scott: There can only be drama if there is stupidity.

780
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:22,410
Rym: Yes, and we don't put up with drama.

781
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:27,050
Rym: So over the years we've not put up as a crew with anyone who caused drama.

782
00:57:27,431 --> 00:57:33,190
Rym: So as a result, we'll have 20 people with us at Otakon and it works out great because no one fights with anyone.

783
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,350
Scott: There's no drama because there's no one stupid.

784
00:57:36,472 --> 00:57:40,230
Rym: But then we see you know, all these other groups of people trying to have hotel rooms Otakon.

785
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,415
Rym: There's all crazy drama.

786
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:45,090
Rym: people don't pay people don't show up people break up with people and then have fights.

787
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:47,155
Scott: We don't deal with that shit.

788
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:49,324
Rym: All right, we're like Snorlax.

789
00:57:49,545 --> 00:57:50,810
Scott: We kicked your ass to the back row.

790
00:57:52,977 --> 00:57:53,805
Scott: Okay, I think that covers it.

791
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:58,230
Rym: Wow, we really need some sort of way to end this because we just keep talking.

792
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,259
Scott: Snorlax could beat up the whole front row crew.

793
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,249
Scott: Look at that Snorlax IV fuck.

794
00:58:03,309 --> 00:58:03,570
Rym: I don't know.

795
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:04,909
Rym: I think Pete could beat up Snorlax.

796
00:58:06,031 --> 00:58:07,980
Scott: Do you know how big Snorlax is?

797
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:10,090
Scott: You don't know shit about Pokemon, do you?

798
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,604
Rym: Do you know how big Pete is?

799
00:58:11,624 --> 00:58:12,230
Rym: Pete is ripped.

800
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:14,637
Scott: He's no more ripped than Snorlax.

801
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,280
Rym: He might be.

802
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,610
Scott: No, he couldn't hold ten Pokemon.

803
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,479
Rym: Yeah, but Pete has the power of his Viking ancestors.

804
00:58:22,443 --> 00:58:24,229
Scott: Don't be shit in the face of some Pokemons.
