1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,979
Rym: It's Thursday, October 5th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:10,240
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,355 --> 00:00:13,830
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,436
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:18,630
Rym: We are reviewing the Warwick Applefest.

6
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:22,628
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,730
Rym: So, uh... I don't have an opening bit about biking.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,360
Rym: Like, nothing weird happened.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,167
Rym: Nothing squirrelly.

10
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,590
Rym: But I spent my lunch hanging out in Bryant Park.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,789
Rym: And, uh, do you know what's going on in Bryant Park right now?

12
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:38,722
Scott: Uh, it's springtime.

13
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,029
Scott: There should be a movie screen up.

14
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:43,149
Rym: So, uh, they have torn up all the grass.

15
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:46,350
Rym: And are already putting the skating rink together.

16
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:48,630
Scott: Oh, right.

17
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:50,829
Rym: They are the skating rink...

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,486
Scott: I was like, "Oh, it's

19
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:52,890
Scott: spring.".

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,302
Scott: It's like, "No, it's not.

21
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:54,807
Scott: It's

22
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:54,948
Scott: fall.".

23
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:56,502
Scott: Like, "It's spring.

24
00:00:56,543 --> 00:00:57,289
Scott: They should be putting...".

25
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:06,570
Rym: So, they have already gotten about halfway through building the skating rink and the winter Christmas village in Bryant Park.

26
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,129
Rym: So, as a result, there's, like, nowhere to sit because the whole park is fucked up with this construction and all this nonsense.

27
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,809
Rym: Meanwhile, it was 78 degrees and sunny.

28
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:21,170
Rym: So, everyone in Midtown was trying to hang out in Bryant Park like you would.

29
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,290
Rym: And it was packed to the point that it was like a PAX Expo Hall pre-COVID.

30
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,950
Rym: Like, people trying to get into the park and then, like, failing and nonsense and chaos.

31
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:46,468
Rym: But, I guess what stuck out to me is that I feel like places like New York City, whatever part of the bowels of New York City's government is responsible for planning, the day the Christmas village starts getting built...

32
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:47,770
Scott: The parks department?

33
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:48,087
Scott: Yes.

34
00:01:48,490 --> 00:02:00,727
Rym: At no point has considered whether or not that day should move based on climate change and the fact that it's not going to be cold enough for that skating rink to work probably for a month or two.

35
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:07,689
Scott: It's going to be built... You would be actually shocked at the high temperatures that a skating rink can operate at.

36
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,570
Scott: Obviously, it takes more energy for the cooling system, right?

37
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,530
Rym: Well, but also, it's wet ice, which, like, yes, technically you can skate on it.

38
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,529
Rym: But, and I guess that's fine if it's, you know, public skating in New York when really it's just a bunch of tourists waddling around.

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,070
Scott: I think I had a thing of the day once about the company that does portable skating rinks.

40
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,630
Scott: They set one up at, like, a ballroom at, like, you know, Georgia University, right?

41
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,874
Rym: But, more importantly, they've taken up a huge percentage of the park with the Christmas village and the shopping nonsense.

42
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:44,550
Rym: now at a time when the weather is going to be nice and people want to hang out in the park on the grass for at least another month or two the way things are going.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,640
Scott: So, I gotta figure... The Christmas village opens... When does it open?

44
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,760
Rym: It's mostly built.

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,420
Rym: Like, a bunch of the huts are fully functional and there's merchandise in them already.

46
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:59,960
Scott: I'm just looking at the park's department website to see, like, the day that it's supposed to start.

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:12,620
Scott: Because it's like, yeah, it's like if they're gonna, you know, open it on a certain day, then it's like obviously you have to start building it far enough in advance that it's ready on that day.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,940
Scott: I just don't know what the day is.

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,999
Rym: Surprisingly close to being done based on the work they're doing, meaning the park is basically useless to people now until Christmas.

50
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:27,560
Scott: I mean, usually that thing is still open in, like, early January, too, right?

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:27,896
Scott: Yeah.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,339
Rym: If you want some really overpriced stuff.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,180
Rym: And some actually pretty good food.

54
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:41,119
Rym: The food there is actually... Every year, the only complaint I have about the food is that there are very long lines to get food at it and the food tends to take a while, but...

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,625
Scott: Here we go.

56
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,820
Scott: Bryant Park Event Club.

57
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,920
Rym: The food in there tends to be pretty good and I feel at least I can... If it's gonna be open early, I can go over there and get that melted cheese for lunch.

58
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:58,080
Scott: Anyway... The park event calendar does not say which day the thing starts.

59
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:09,094
Rym: Anyway, in the news, something historic, and usually when you say something historic happened in American politics, in the current era, that means something very bad happened.

60
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:10,320
Rym: and that is true once again.

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,959
Rym: Something historic has happened.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:25,340
Rym: For the first time in the history of America's democracy, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is the lower chamber of our Congress, has been ousted, meaning they were kicked out.

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
Scott: Yeah, this happens in other countries.

64
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:29,700
Scott: They oust their prime minister with the no-confidence votes, basically the same thing.

65
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:37,140
Rym: It's a very different kind of thing because of the structure of the elections there and the fact that a prime minister serves at the pleasure of a coalition.

66
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,753
Scott: Yeah, I'm just saying it's...

67
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:52,460
Rym: They're very different too in that they happen commonly because there is a process around it where if the coalition falls, then the prime minister gets booted basically automatically through a no-confidence vote.

68
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,840
Scott: I think the biggest difference is that when that happens, you usually have elections.

69
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:06,560
Rym: Well, that's it because the process is you need an election to restructure the parliament and then, based on the results of the election, a new coalition has to form and that coalition appoints a new prime minister.

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,137
Scott: It sure would be great if this triggered an election.

71
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:11,760
Scott: That would be nice.

72
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:13,960
Scott: That would fix things maybe a little bit.

73
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,482
Scott: It doesn't.

74
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:22,739
Scott: We have the problem where we have the no-confidence vote and then no election, so you're stuck with the same people and those people just figure it out.

75
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,361
Rym: Yep.

76
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:43,720
Rym: It's even worse than that because in America, because there's basically... Due to the nature of what our speaker is responsible for, because the Speaker of the House in America is paradoxically one of the most powerful political positions on earth because our government is designed very stupidly in this regard.

77
00:05:43,860 --> 00:06:05,180
Rym: So if you're not a U.S.ian, basically the House only ever votes on things that the Speaker personally, with zero oversight, decides come to the floor to a vote and no one can supersede them except in extremely narrow circumstances that are almost impossible to trigger.

78
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,833
Scott: It doesn't have to be that way, but that's the rules.

79
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:10,459
Scott: the House has decided for itself.

80
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:16,060
Rym: Well, the only way to change... Well, some of that is constitutional because there's some other things going on.

81
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,480
Rym: The Speaker of the House is also in the line of succession for the President.

82
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,945
Scott: But basically, it literally is.

83
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:36,873
Scott: There literally is a file cabinet that has all the bills that everyone's... Let's say even if everyone in the whole House, all those hundreds of people, they wrote a bill, they worked together in committees, and they edited it, and they... Even both parties are in love with this bill.

84
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,200
Scott: Everyone is going to vote yes.

85
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:44,713
Scott: It could just sit there, and the Speaker of the House could be like, "I don't feel like we're not going to have a vote for this,".

86
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:47,626
Scott: and it doesn't become a law, and it just sits there.

87
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,980
Scott: And then if the Congress ends, right?

88
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:59,680
Scott: It's like, this is the thing that really bothers me, not just about the federal House, but the federal Congress, but most of the state ones, maybe all of them.

89
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,680
Rym: Oh, that they can just now finish their business and then go home on vacation?

90
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:03,822
Scott: Right.

91
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:08,198
Scott: It's like that there's these sessions that end, and there's clocks.

92
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,650
Scott: It's like the New York State budget every year.

93
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,218
Scott: It's like, "We've got to get the budget done by this

94
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:12,520
Scott: date.".

95
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,046
Scott: And it's like, "What the fuck are you talking about?

96
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,937
Scott: Shouldn't you be working every week of the

97
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:17,218
Scott: year?".

98
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:25,220
Scott: I'm not saying you shouldn't get no vacation ever, because you're still laboring, and it's difficult labor, indeed.

99
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:30,694
Scott: But my company doesn't shut down when I'm on vacation.

100
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:32,100
Scott: Let people take their vacations.

101
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,652
Scott: They can proxy vote or whatever when they're away.

102
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:40,492
Scott: And then it's like, don't stop legislating ever, and don't have weird deadlines.

103
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,000
Scott: Just always be legislating all the time.

104
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,500
Rym: Okay, so I think I wanted to respond to almost every few words you said, but that last one's an important one.

105
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,560
Rym: So in the House right now, this was all triggered by a budget vote based on one of those deadlines.

106
00:07:56,821 --> 00:08:05,320
Rym: That deadline is fucking made up by Republicans to make sure we have this crisis on a regular basis.

107
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,049
Rym: So it's a made up deadline.

108
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:08,420
Rym: They can just vote to get rid of it.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,610
Scott: They're all made up.

110
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,580
Scott: All the deadlines are made up.

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,264
Rym: This one is extra made up.

112
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,671
Rym: It is the most made up deadline.

113
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:17,720
Rym: And it's solely because of our Republican Party.

114
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:18,844
Rym: But it gets worse.

115
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:30,540
Rym: The vast majority, like almost every member of the House, was more than happy to vote on a bill that just continued our current funding to get past the deadline.

116
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,039
Rym: And it was eight motherfuckers who didn't want to vote for it in the Republican Party.

117
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,214
Rym: These eight people are basically literal Nazis.

118
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:42,480
Rym: They are the worst people in our government.

119
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:46,780
Rym: And one of them literally looks like Butthead from Beavis and Butthead.

120
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,728
Rym: He is the instigator of all of this.

121
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,100
Rym: There's so much going on here.

122
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,211
Rym: So everyone wanted to pass this.

123
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:54,740
Rym: It's an obvious thing to pass.

124
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,660
Rym: And passing it is only required for bullshit made up reasons.

125
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:00,940
Rym: And yet they couldn't pass it because the Speaker refused to put it to a vote.

126
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:12,060
Rym: because the Republicans only ever want to pass bills with only Republican support because they don't want to ever, they've said this out loud, make any compromise with the Democratic Party under any circumstances ever.

127
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:16,420
Rym: Either pass something with only Republican votes or never bring it to the floor.

128
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,660
Rym: That is like the most sacrosanct rule of the Republican Party.

129
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:31,040
Rym: So the Speaker of the House, who is a dipshit, like don't get me wrong, I'm not praising him at any point, he is a fascist, he is a horrible, he is a very bad person, McCarthy.

130
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:47,618
Rym: But after he tried to get the Republicans to pass a bill on their own and these eight dipshits said no, he actually did the reasonable thing and brought the generic bill to the floor to say, "Look, we're all going to vote on this and if Democrats vote for it, it'll

131
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:47,900
Rym: pass.".

132
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,462
Rym: And guess what?

133
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:53,240
Rym: All the Democrats voted for it except like one and like a hundred Republicans voted for it.

134
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,840
Rym: And it passed immediately and we avoided a government shutdown.

135
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,725
Rym: The dipshit caucus then immediately removed the Speaker from power and now the U.S.

136
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:05,800
Rym: House has no Speaker and cannot do anything and is completely powerless.

137
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:08,619
Scott: Well good, if it can't do anything, it can't do anything bad.

138
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,494
Rym: That's true, except that deadline, the bill that got passed.

139
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:15,300
Rym: the deadline just pushed the deadline off a month.

140
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,859
Rym: So we're going to have this exact crisis soon and it's going to be bad.

141
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:19,686
Rym: Awesome.

142
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:20,500
Scott: It'll be hilarious.

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,220
Rym: Even funnier, the dipshit, the butthead guy, who is the instigator of all of this, the House was working to kick him out of the House actually.

144
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,260
Rym: Like the Republicans want to kick him out of the House for ethics violations.

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,340
Rym: Guess what they can't do until there's a new Speaker?

146
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:35,280
Scott: Yeah.

147
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:40,960
Rym: And guess who can prevent them from voting on a new Speaker?

148
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:41,968
Scott: Yeah.

149
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:49,960
Rym: It's a game of chicken where there's literally no way out of it except a coup or a huge percentage of the Republicans allying with the Democrats.

150
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,087
Scott: You don't need a huge percentage.

151
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:53,617
Scott: You need like four or five.

152
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:54,100
Scott: I haven't counted.

153
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:56,426
Rym: That's the fun part.

154
00:10:56,566 --> 00:11:00,040
Rym: There's a tricky way this could go because the Democrats are playing this very smart.

155
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:13,120
Rym: Their plan is that every time there's a House vote for the new Speaker, which is the only thing the House is allowed to do until they have a new Speaker, the Democrats are going to vote for Hakeem Jeffries, who is an awesome dude.

156
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,301
Rym: Of course.

157
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:15,479
Scott: That's what they did the last time, which is the right thing to do.

158
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:15,960
Rym: Yep.

159
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:23,819
Rym: And the Republicans either have to get 100% of their members to vote for somebody, and that's not going to happen.

160
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:25,460
Scott: Or Hakeem Jeffries wins.

161
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,779
Rym: Or five of them have to vote for Hakeem Jeffries.

162
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:35,298
Rym: And Jeffries would probably be more than happy to make some concessions and work with the people who decided to do that.

163
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,080
Scott: Jeffries would be probably the best Speaker of the House ever.

164
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:41,581
Rym: Oh, yeah.

165
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,007
Rym: Hakeem Jeffries is odd.

166
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,960
Rym: Just go read about his deal.

167
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,820
Rym: He is one of the best politicians in America right now, like Hakeem for President, for real.

168
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,503
Rym: Yeah, sure.

169
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:52,410
Scott: That's great.

170
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:53,740
Scott: That's an easy vote.

171
00:11:54,583 --> 00:12:07,020
Rym: So, despite all of this, this is a crisis, partly because this has literally never happened, and there are a lot of constitutional questions, and there's a lot of unclear steps on how this all is going to go down.

172
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:18,559
Rym: During all of this, the temporary Speaker of the House, the person whose only job is to be the fake Speaker, whose only power is to elect a new Speaker...

173
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,196
Scott: Yeah, he can't go and bring up some other laws or anything to vote.

174
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,412
Scott: See what he did?

175
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:22,760
Scott: He kicked...

176
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:29,080
Rym: A bunch of Democrats, who he personally hates, out of their offices in the Capitol to put Republicans in them.

177
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,096
Scott: That's the kind of petty, childish things that they do.

178
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:31,580
Scott: That's not new.

179
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,444
Rym: Just to be a prick.

180
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,439
Rym: And while that could be its own...

181
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,685
Scott: Get ready to lose.

182
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:39,800
Scott: Get ready to see what happens to you when you're not in charge.

183
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:51,528
Rym: So, the Democrats who were kicked out, actually, to their credit, instead of making a big stink and fighting a lawsuit and all this sort of nonsense, they basically just said, "That's exactly what the Republicans are like.

184
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:54,138
Rym: I can't believe how petty this is.

185
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:54,600
Rym: Whatever.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,047
Rym: Tell me what my office is.

187
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:56,973
Rym: You have to give me at least

188
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:57,194
Rym: one.".

189
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,844
Scott: Eh.

190
00:12:58,884 --> 00:12:59,226
Scott: Whatever.

191
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:00,934
Scott: Be like, "All right.

192
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,276
Scott: Go.

193
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:01,537
Scott: I don't

194
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:01,758
Scott: care.".

195
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:11,100
Rym: This is newsworthy in that this is historic, and this is the most dysfunctional thing that has happened in the House of Representatives ever.

196
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,580
Scott: It's gonna get more dysfunctional.

197
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,467
Rym: Oh, yeah.

198
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:14,699
Rym: It's like that Simpsons meme.

199
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,479
Rym: The most dysfunctional thing to ever happen so far.

200
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:18,842
Scott: Eh.

201
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:20,047
Scott: Whatever.

202
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,633
Scott: At least it's entertaining.

203
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:23,260
Scott: It'd be boring if everything was just normal.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,551
Rym: I don't like that.

205
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:40,319
Rym: some people, especially people who claim to be centrists, which is just a coward's way of saying you're actually conservative, but I don't like people who treat horse trading politics as direct entertainment because people die based on these decisions.

206
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:43,620
Rym: Racist governments cause racist actions that hurt people.

207
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:55,400
Rym: But this is entertaining partly because the Democrats are actually using their power to its fullest extent and pointing out what a clown show the Republicans are.

208
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,959
Rym: They're both doing the right thing with the full extended power.

209
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:02,119
Scott: They're doing all they can do without trying to break the rules or anything.

210
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,060
Rym: The only thing they can do more than they are doing right now is literally start a coup.

211
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,780
Scott: Everyone is doing what is within their power to do.

212
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:13,620
Scott: That's what I fully expect, right?

213
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,025
Scott: Yep.

214
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,260
Rym: It's heartening and we'll see how this goes.

215
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,500
Rym: So speaking of clown shows, you want to talk about Travis Scott?

216
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,721
Scott: Yeah.

217
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:26,800
Scott: Well, so everyone knows, we talk about this frequently on GeekNights, right?

218
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:41,980
Scott: That even though we hate capitalism, there is a reality in this world that some things have necessarily, not unnecessarily, we hate it when it's unnecessary and false scarcity, artificial scarcity, but some things are literally scarce, right?

219
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:53,079
Scott: And the easiest example to go to that a lot of people encounter in their lives are tickets to concerts and other such venues because the event happens once.

220
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:59,160
Scott: We're not going to play World Series Game 4 several times so that everyone can see it, right?

221
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:00,939
Scott: It's like it's happening once.

222
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,291
Scott: There are only so many seats in the stadium.

223
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:04,659
Scott: That's it, right?

224
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:07,170
Rym: You can't just magically make more appear.

225
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:09,220
Rym: There's even a culture book about that.

226
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:28,579
Rym: You didn't read this one, but that culture book has an event where a supernova is going to happen and there's a limited radius where people can see it directly with their own eyes and the culture accidentally reinvents money just for the sole purpose of people being able to go to this show because it'll literally only ever happen once.

227
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:30,264
Scott: Yep, exactly.

228
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:41,620
Scott: So, people get mad because what happens is the people who run concerts and other events sell tickets at too low a price even though the demand exceeds the supply.

229
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,390
Rym: Too low by economic standards.

230
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:44,780
Rym: We're not talking about society.

231
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,479
Rym: We're not talking about whether or not this is good or evil or whatever.

232
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:58,260
Scott: And when you do that, inevitably, there's nothing you can do about this, is that somebody will buy the tickets and sell them for a higher price and basically make a margin on that.

233
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,384
Rym: This is called arbitrage.

234
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:08,160
Rym: If Scott buys something for $20 that Rym is willing to buy for $50, Scott can sell it to Rym for $50 and make a profit, and that is expected.

235
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,840
Rym: That is like mechanism design 101 that that will happen.

236
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:25,273
Scott: The only way to avoid this, which people, I guess, would also be upset about, would be if the original ticket price was the highest price the market would pay, in which case people would be mad because Taylor Swift tickets would be like $5,000, $10,000, right?

237
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:32,220
Scott: On the face value, and people wouldn't go for that, right?

238
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,240
Rym: You're talking about when MagFest sells out.

239
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:45,918
Rym: If they just sold MagFest at the maximum price that would sell out MagFest at all the hotels, I would pay several hundred dollars to go to a MagFest, but not everyone can afford that, but that's what the price would be.

240
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:46,900
Scott: Right.

241
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:59,180
Scott: Regardless, so the problem is because of this scenario, a lot of people get into this business of being ticket brokers and using bots and other various means to scoop up tickets, right?

242
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,040
Scott: And then resell them and make a profit.

243
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:01,582
Scott: Okay.

244
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:02,828
Scott: We know all that story.

245
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,380
Scott: It is an additional story, right?

246
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:15,858
Scott: People in the United States and around the world have credit cards, and when you pay for something with a credit card, the person you bought something from has to pay a fee, the merchant's fee, right?

247
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,760
Scott: And that merchant's fee goes to the bank, right?

248
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,260
Scott: If it's like a Chase Bank credit card, Chase gets some money.

249
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,979
Scott: If it's a Visa credit card, Visa gets some money.

250
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:29,594
Scott: And to encourage you, right?

251
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,640
Scott: Because that's where they make all their money, is from you swiping their credit card, right?

252
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,880
Scott: They get the merchant, the person you swiped at pays them.

253
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,560
Scott: They want you to use that credit card all the fucking time.

254
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:39,800
Scott: Yup.

255
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:45,640
Rym: I mean, there's a reason why I am very willing to be the one who swipes my credit card when I rent a big Airbnb for all my friends.

256
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:45,781
Scott: Yeah.

257
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,659
Scott: When you're swiping a credit card, right?

258
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,340
Scott: And so when you swipe your credit card, they encourage you to do this by sharing some of that with you, right?

259
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:07,660
Scott: So basically, every time you swipe your credit card at any business, that person who runs that business pays MasterCard or whoever the fuck, and then they, in turn, pay you back some of the money with rewards.

260
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:12,320
Scott: And the only person who gets screwed by credit cards are businesses that accept credit cards.

261
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:12,741
Scott: Yup.

262
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:17,780
Rym: I got status on an airline solely from one swipe when I rented that beach house for everybody.

263
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:18,803
Scott: Right.

264
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:28,159
Scott: It's like, you can, the airline, basically airlines make more of their money from people swiping airline credit cards all around the world than they do from selling plane tickets, right?

265
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:41,020
Scott: Because they're getting a trickle in of all those little bits of money from all these swipes everywhere, and those swipes turn into points, and as long as the points aren't spent, which a lot of them aren't, they just sit in a pile of money like a bank.

266
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:45,580
Scott: And that's where all the wealth of airlines is, not in selling plane tickets.

267
00:18:46,082 --> 00:19:03,540
Scott: Anyway, so here's the thing, if you are someone who has a credit card, if you knew for certain, absolute certain, that you could buy something and then resell the something at or higher than the price you bought it for, even if you had no interest in that something.

268
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:11,959
Scott: So if I knew for certain that I could buy a Taylor Swift concert ticket and resell it for more than I paid, which I do know that.

269
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,180
Rym: If you could even resell it for as low as slightly less than you paid, you'd still break certain.

270
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,220
Scott: Right, but that's besides the point, right?

271
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:27,499
Scott: If I know that I can buy a Taylor Swift concert ticket with my credit card and then sell it, and at the same price or greater or slightly less, like Rym said, right?

272
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:37,019
Scott: Then I will profit because even though I didn't keep the ticket and I didn't make any money on the arbitrage, I got points for using my credit card.

273
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:50,479
Scott: So there is a community of people online who basically are trying to constantly max out, get lots of credit cards, max them out, but then max them out by buying things that they then resell.

274
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:54,640
Scott: So basically they can always pay off their credit card in full.

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,739
Scott: They didn't actually lose any money, but they got shit tons of points and rewards and cash back.

276
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:06,360
Scott: And they're profiting just by buying things and selling things that they don't even fucking want, right?

277
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:20,340
Scott: And so this is a perfect storm because concert tickets set up systems to try to stop bots, but individual people with credit cards, legitimate actual people, not bots, right?

278
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,399
Scott: If you can organize those people and say, "Hey, I'm putting the word out.

279
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:34,978
Scott: Anyone out there who has a credit card, if you buy Taylor Swift tickets, I will buy them from you at like a 10% markup guaranteed, I swear, right?

280
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:38,620
Scott: If you do this, you'll get credit card points.

281
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,760
Scott: Let's all team up and I'll be the one to sell all the tickets.

282
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,520
Scott: You won't have to take the risk of trying to find a buyer, right?

283
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:48,040
Scott: I'm guaranteeing you this markup, right?

284
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:50,594
Scott: And then I'll take on the risk of finding actual

285
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:51,037
Scott: buyers.".

286
00:20:51,520 --> 00:21:03,277
Rym: And that is how capital markets arbitrage works is a series of steps like this where someone assumes a risk and then someone else basically underwrites that risk by saying, "No, I'll assume that

287
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:03,639
Rym: risk.".

288
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,959
Rym: And everyone's taking a piece along the way.

289
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,500
Scott: So there's a company that did exactly that.

290
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:16,953
Scott: They would put out the word and they would say, "Hey, all you people who want to max out your credit cards and get points, buy this and I will buy it from you, right?

291
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:18,078
Scott: Do it

292
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:18,278
Scott: now.".

293
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,840
Scott: And so people would go buy the tickets, they sold it to the company, it worked.

294
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,580
Scott: Those people got credit card points.

295
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,120
Scott: That company got tickets, they resold the tickets, they made money.

296
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:30,100
Scott: It actually worked.

297
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:32,740
Scott: People don't like it, but that was happening.

298
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,878
Scott: It's a thing, the only solution is the one we discussed.

299
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,400
Rym: I can't even actually argue that it's particularly unethical.

300
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,260
Scott: I'm just saying, that's a thing that's happened.

301
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,479
Scott: So here's the funny part, right?

302
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Scott: That risk was never eliminated, right?

303
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,760
Scott: You think that sounds like the least risky thing ever.

304
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,979
Scott: Of course you can resell the Taylor Swift tickets, right?

305
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,597
Scott: Well, the company said, "All right, let's do the Travis Scott

306
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:56,939
Scott: tickets.".

307
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,580
Rym: Now you might remember, there's an important piece of information.

308
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,600
Scott: Travis Scott, who is incredibly popular, he's like insane popular.

309
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:16,839
Rym: But he had a concert in 2021 that, due to poor crowd control and fucked up, there's a whole report on who is responsible for this, 10 people were killed by a massive crowd crush.

310
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:18,099
Scott: No, that's true.

311
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:22,160
Scott: But regardless, this guy is still insanely popular.

312
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:26,920
Scott: He's chart-topping, streaming, big, big popular artist.

313
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:29,159
Scott: You got to imagine his shows are going to sell out.

314
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,400
Scott: And the demand will be higher than the supply.

315
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,918
Scott: So the company says, "All right, everybody, go buy the tickets with your credit

316
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:35,240
Scott: cards.".

317
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:37,439
Scott: And guess what happened?

318
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,360
Scott: Uh-oh, the demand, we don't know why.

319
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,280
Scott: It could be the reason Rym suggested people are afraid of dying.

320
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,776
Scott: It could be that he's not as popular now.

321
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:47,279
Scott: Who knows?

322
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:49,279
Scott: But the demand was not there.

323
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:53,580
Scott: And the company that assumed the risk cannot resell the tickets.

324
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,319
Rym: People are buying good tickets for as low as $14 on Stuff Hub right now.

325
00:22:58,923 --> 00:22:59,185
Scott: Right.

326
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:07,420
Scott: So basically, people bought the tickets with their credit cards, and some of them were not able to get paid back from the company that's centralizing all this.

327
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,480
Scott: And now they're trying to, people trying to max out their credit cards got hosed.

328
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:22,340
Scott: And then the company that told everyone to max out their credit cards is also getting hosed, sitting on a pile of tickets that they can't sell for even face value because no one wants to go to the concert.

329
00:23:23,962 --> 00:23:36,500
Scott: And, you know, the winner in this case would be Travis Scott, who sold out, he sold out his concert, whereas if there hadn't been people trying to arbitrage, he would not have sold out his concert and made less money.

330
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:43,340
Scott: So he's very happy about this whole situation, even though his concert won't be that crowded, but his concert wouldn't have been crowded anyway.

331
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:47,260
Scott: Even if this didn't happen, his concert still would have had the same audience.

332
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,261
Rym: And his concert might now actually get more crowded if people could buy tickets for $14.

333
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:56,600
Scott: Yeah, more people might actually come now that the prices are tanked.

334
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,340
Scott: But all the people trying to do the scam have gotten screwed, which is just kind of hilarious.

335
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:36,992
Rym: Oh yeah, because that is, you know, capitalism, I guess, as a professional in capitalism, based on my day job, I would say that one of the most important controls on a capitalist system, one that the lack of such controls is one of the main reasons why capitalism tends to hurt people so badly and concentrate wealth so profoundly, is that if you are making a profit and all you are providing to make that profit is an assumption of risk, then if the risk comes to pass,

336
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:37,434
Scott: you

337
00:24:37,595 --> 00:24:38,420
Rym: must get fucked.

338
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:41,400
Rym: Otherwise, you are making a profit for nothing.

339
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:49,380
Rym: So these people getting fucked is good by most measures, by moral measures, by capitalist measures.

340
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:56,580
Rym: Capitalism would be less cruel if more people who were only paid by assuming risk got fucked more often by that risk.

341
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:08,880
Scott: Yep, the bad parts of capitalism, it's usually a situation where people fucked around and did not find out, or someone made someone else find out when they're the ones who fucked around, right?

342
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,060
Scott: Like all the banks that got bailed out instead of when they should have gone to prison.

343
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:26,819
Rym: Or big brain theory, situations like the existence of 401(k)s, which was a big part of why pensions went away, where that basically guarantees that anyone who makes money is throwing money into the stock market, thus perpetuating a cycle of the number has to always go up.

344
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:27,880
Scott: Yep.

345
00:25:28,603 --> 00:25:36,719
Scott: Anyway, this is just a hilarious situation, and it's a topic that we talk about often, and I'm sure we will talk about again, but it's a new twist.

346
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:51,379
Scott: But it does make me think, though, that the credit card part of it is not really the worst idea, and if you do come across something where you are absolutely certain, like, you have to be really certain, right?

347
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,680
Scott: Like a Taylor Swift concert.

348
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,000
Scott: If you're only 90%, that's not good enough, right?

349
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,820
Rym: I mean, remember those guys who pooled in the $10,000 to bet on a cricket match while it was going, and the team was up by like 100, and then they lost?

350
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:13,319
Scott: Right, it's like, you gotta be so certain that the thing you are buying is going to be able to be resold at, or at least at the value you paid.

351
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:31,399
Scott: If you're that certain of that, even if it's a thing you don't want, if the value of it is high enough, it may be worth it to buy it with your credit card and then resell it just to get points, and it's like, if that doesn't take too much effort that it's, you know, worth your time, maybe do it?

352
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:32,044
Scott: Right?

353
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:33,340
Scott: It's better than casino.

354
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,975
Scott: It's, you know, it's probably less risky than the stock market if, if, the biggest.

355
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:42,120
Scott: if, you really have that certainty.

356
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,008
Scott: Like, so certain.

357
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:46,200
Scott: We're talking, like, Super Bowl ticket certainty.

358
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:49,116
Scott: Like, you know you can resell them.

359
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:49,720
Scott: No question.

360
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,478
Scott: But I guess even there, there's a risk that the Super Bowl can be cancelled.

361
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,200
Rym: It might not necessarily work out if the team, like...

362
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,967
Scott: No, it might not.

363
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,073
Scott: No, it has to be really... But it's like, even the Super Bowl can get cancelled.

364
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:00,959
Scott: There's always a risk.

365
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:04,656
Scott: But I think Super Bowl cancelled is a less risk than...

366
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:13,120
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

367
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:25,000
Rym: So, a long time ago, like, a decade or more ago, I had a thing of the day that was, like, an AMV that implied that Speed Racer was actually a bad person who hurt people.

368
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:29,600
Scott: Speed Racer is a bad person who hurts people and has monkey labor.

369
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:31,159
Scott: Child and monkey labor.

370
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,619
Rym: I mean, how many people...

371
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,319
Scott: In his employ.

372
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,460
Rym: There are so many episodes of Speed Racer where he just rams someone off the road and the car explodes, and no one seems to hear shit.

373
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,935
Scott: This car has guns that shoot people, and it's like...

374
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:58,079
Rym: But, uh, I have found an entire corner of the internet of people who basically just make long-form, relatively high production value videos, really highlighting the violence and the evil of Speed Racer, and this is the best of them that I have seen.

375
00:27:59,005 --> 00:27:59,940
Scott: He's really evil.

376
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:01,269
Scott: Cars.

377
00:28:01,877 --> 00:28:02,080
Scott: Bad.

378
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,353
Rym: This is titled "Speed Racer's Vehicle of

379
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:05,955
Rym: Violence.".

380
00:28:08,301 --> 00:28:15,460
Scott: Well, you know, as my news suggested, we on GeekNights love to discuss gambling and how you shouldn't do it, ever.

381
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:19,400
Scott: Even though we'll talk about it constantly.

382
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,419
Rym: I'm playing this gambling game right now while we talk.

383
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,181
Scott: Yeah.

384
00:28:23,004 --> 00:28:27,700
Scott: And one of the gamblings that you should never, ever, ever do, under any circumstance, is video poker.

385
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,579
Scott: Video poker is, like, one of the worst things you can put money into.

386
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,820
Scott: Basically, like, it's 'cause it has this illusion that you have some sort of control or skill involved, right?

387
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,880
Scott: 'Cause you're actually deciding to hold cards and draw other cards, right?

388
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,620
Scott: But, a video poker machine is just a slot machine in disguise.

389
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:47,063
Scott: Yup.

390
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:49,440
Scott: And the payouts are terrible.

391
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,244
Rym: Well, you know what it is?

392
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:56,599
Rym: It's a slot machine where you can't be better at it with skill, but if you are very stupid, you will somehow be worse at it.

393
00:28:57,265 --> 00:28:58,720
Scott: Yeah, you can misclick or make a mistake.

394
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,860
Rym: It measures a slot machine where, if you pull the lever too slow, you're less likely to win.

395
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,018
Rym: That's what video poker is.

396
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:05,621
Scott: Yeah.

397
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:07,840
Scott: Video poker is just avoid it at all costs.

398
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,220
Scott: But, video poker, the game, I guess, right?

399
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,780
Scott: If you take away the real money part of it, is just sort of this aesthetic thing, right?

400
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,120
Scott: Like, sitting at a video poker machine.

401
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,340
Scott: It's sort of a unique kind of machine with a unique display and art style and sounds.

402
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:28,519
Scott: And, you know, it's this kind of experience of just playing it.

403
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:36,380
Scott: So, somebody, it's kind of awesome, they made this classic video poker on a website.

404
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:45,660
Scott: So, you go to this website and just, like, this perfect, like, scanline, CRT-looking, like, video poker just loads.

405
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,349
Scott: And you can play it with, they give you $25.

406
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:51,520
Scott: It's just the number 25 is on the screen, right?

407
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:57,421
Scott: And you can just play, and if you run out of money, you can reload and go back to $25.

408
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:02,140
Scott: It's just a video poker clone, basically, but it's just the feeling of playing it.

409
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,059
Rym: The sound effects it makes are real good.

410
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:04,801
Scott: Yeah.

411
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:10,780
Scott: It's just on the money and, you know, if you have any urge to play video poker, just play this.

412
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,567
Scott: Hooray.

413
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:13,620
Scott: Yeah, that's about all you're going to win.

414
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,420
Scott: Just play this and you can sort of get all of the good parts, you know, whatever good parts video poker has are here.

415
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:24,940
Scott: And the "guaranteed you're going to lose your money" part is not here because it's free.

416
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,760
Rym: It's just the website.

417
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,240
Rym: Alright, in the meta moment, the GeekNights book club book, the murder bot diary.

418
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,960
Rym: Once diaries, once we, the next one comes out, we'll read that and then we'll give you guys a few weeks to read it and then we'll do a show on it.

419
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:40,919
Rym: I am five murder bots in.

420
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:42,262
Scott: Mm-hmm.

421
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:44,078
Scott: I am all the murder bots in.

422
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,619
Rym: Yep, you've gotten a little more murder bot than me.

423
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,159
Scott: Literally all of it, except for what's going to be published very soon.

424
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,920
Rym: They are very, very fast reads.

425
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,100
Rym: Otherwise, we're going to be at PAX with not one, but two panels.

426
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,640
Rym: Well, two events and it looks like the schedule just got published, so I'll make a post about it now.

427
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,519
Scott: But only one of our events is on the schedule.

428
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,120
Rym: Oh, I guess the learn and play schedule is not published yet.

429
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,808
Scott: Oh, I think that is the event.

430
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:12,500
Scott: I think the other one is not on the schedule.

431
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,106
Rym: Well, there you go, because we're definitely doing two.

432
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:17,800
Rym: We are doing on one day, I had the note up, I got to post later.

433
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:23,760
Rym: Anyway, one of the days we are doing a brand new panel, mastering game mechanics, worker placement.

434
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,098
Rym: Rym and Scott talking about nothing but worker placement mechanics for 59 minutes.

435
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,640
Rym: It's going to be glorious.

436
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
Scott: And that is not on the official schedule yet.

437
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:36,100
Rym: We are doing a learn and play and win.

438
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:41,980
Rym: We're going to teach you all how to be good at Wist, Hearts, and Wizard.

439
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:44,850
Scott: That is on the schedule.

440
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:46,140
Scott: That is on the PAX website.

441
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,868
Rym: It's going to be exciting.

442
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:47,900
Rym: I'm looking forward to that one.

443
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,646
Rym: We're not going to actually play Wist.

444
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:53,280
Rym: We're going to do one hand of Wist with everyone because Wist is not worth playing.

445
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,740
Rym: It's basically just how to learn to do trick taking.

446
00:31:57,723 --> 00:31:58,630
Rym: But we will teach Wist.

447
00:31:58,731 --> 00:31:59,779
Rym: Wist is a pretty simple game.

448
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:03,526
Rym: Any other meta?

449
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,158
Rym: I guess we can talk about the website.

450
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:15,597
Scott: We are going to attempt to launch the New Geek Guys website on Saturday, October 2 days from now.

451
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:15,737
Scott: 7th?

452
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:15,817
Scott: 7th.

453
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,110
Scott: We'll see how that goes.

454
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,795
Scott: It might fail.

455
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:20,379
Scott: We could revert.

456
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:28,420
Scott: Rym is obsessed with this new noise he found.

457
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,480
Rym: That new noise I found is the announcement sound anytime I join a Discord voice chat now.

458
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,140
Scott: Yeah, mine is much better than that.

459
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:37,840
Rym: I made it as long as possible to be as annoying as possible.

460
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,437
Scott: Yeah, see mine is this one.

461
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:42,439
Rym: That's a real good one.

462
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,268
Scott: That's as bad as good as it gets.

463
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,938
Scott: I couldn't think of anything better.

464
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:46,280
Scott: Anyway.

465
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,296
Rym: It's the elephant sound.

466
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:48,624
Scott: That's right.

467
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:50,395
Scott: I'm coming in like an elephant.

468
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,059
Rym: Watch the fuck out.

469
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:52,619
Scott: It's a spider elephant.

470
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:55,156
Scott: Elephant bit by radioactive spider.

471
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:55,419
Scott: Anyway.

472
00:32:56,562 --> 00:32:57,486
Scott: So yeah, it might work.

473
00:32:57,547 --> 00:32:58,070
Scott: It might not.

474
00:32:58,552 --> 00:32:59,155
Scott: You might like it.

475
00:32:59,175 --> 00:32:59,980
Scott: You might not like it.

476
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,948
Scott: That's tough cookies.

477
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:01,494
Scott: We like it.

478
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:02,140
Scott: We're going with it.

479
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:06,540
Scott: It does enough that it can replace the current website.

480
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,060
Scott: We're going to continue to work on it because the code is so updated.

481
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,778
Scott: It's actually very easy to work on and update this website since the code isn't 10+ years old.

482
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,544
Scott: It's modern.

483
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:20,060
Scott: It auto deploys all kinds of fancy shit.

484
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,379
Scott: And that code will be on GitHub.

485
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,079
Scott: And you can send us pull requests or whatever and help work on it for no money if that's what you want to do.

486
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:32,167
Scott: And yeah, that's exciting.

487
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:34,720
Scott: Finally, we talked so long and shit talking.

488
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,419
Scott: But no, it's going to be for real.

489
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,880
Scott: And if there's any, you know, you can even just send suggestions in the GitHub issues if you want, you know.

490
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:43,641
Rym: Yeah.

491
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:46,858
Rym: And from there we can start to do it.

492
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:49,539
Rym: Once we've got it live and all the kinks are ironed out.

493
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,279
Rym: That's where we can start to do some new stuff.

494
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:53,892
Rym: We can dig into the hopper.

495
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:54,840
Rym: The GeekNights hopper.

496
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:55,509
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:55,899
Scott: That's right.

498
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,060
Rym: We kept talking about it, but we never actually did it.

499
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,799
Rym: We didn't add the new bit we were talking about at the end of the show.

500
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,200
Scott: I mean, you know, we talk about a lot of things that we don't do.

501
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,379
Rym: We do talk about a lot of things.

502
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,159
Scott: But then sometimes we do them.

503
00:34:09,282 --> 00:34:10,690
Rym: And our worker placement panel is on.

504
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,920
Rym: I actually pulled it up from this internal.

505
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,100
Rym: Saturday 2.30 PM in the Crab God Theater.

506
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,739
Scott: All right, let me see.

507
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,550
Rym: Feel free to announce it to the world.

508
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,000
Rym: It is by no means a secret.

509
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:23,942
Scott: I see.

510
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:26,820
Scott: The Crab God Theater is not yet listed in the list of locations.

511
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:27,583
Rym: Ah.

512
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:30,998
Rym: I wonder what other secrets the Crab God is hiding from us.

513
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,360
Rym: All right.

514
00:34:32,743 --> 00:34:37,219
Rym: So on GeekNights we've reviewed things like video games.

515
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,739
Rym: We've reviewed conventions.

516
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Rym: We've reviewed concerts.

517
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:44,179
Rym: I don't see why we can't review an Apple Fest that we went to upstate.

518
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,560
Scott: So I've been to this Apple Fest before.

519
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:48,560
Scott: New York is the Empire State.

520
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:50,840
Scott: Apples are sort of our thing.

521
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:53,138
Scott: There's a lot of fucking apple orchards here.

522
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:54,960
Scott: Apple Seasons.

523
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,478
Rym: If you live out of the U.S.

524
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:59,120
Rym: I feel like a lot of people who live outside of the U.S.

525
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,649
Rym: At least have this impression that like Yeah, Americans.

526
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:02,900
Rym: There's something with them and apples.

527
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,633
Rym: Because apples are very...

528
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:06,780
Scott: New York is the big apple.

529
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:11,260
Rym: Johnny Appleseed is a full hero in America.

530
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,380
Rym: Even though the Disney movie is very wrong about what he was doing.

531
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:15,844
Rym: Spoilers.

532
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:17,560
Rym: He was making fucking apple whiskey.

533
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,698
Rym: He was making alcohol.

534
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,180
Rym: He was not making apple fritters or apple pies.

535
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,937
Scott: Places have their local crops.

536
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,779
Scott: You go to Columbia, get some coffee.

537
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,460
Scott: Go to New York, get some apples.

538
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:32,459
Scott: It's apple season.

539
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,558
Scott: And there's a town in New York State.

540
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,180
Scott: It's not part of New York City.

541
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,798
Scott: It's New York State called Warwick.

542
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:41,279
Scott: And it's a cute little quaint country home kind of town.

543
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,839
Rym: It's about an hour north of the city.

544
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,320
Rym: Unless there's typical traffic.

545
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,759
Rym: In which case it's two and a half hour.

546
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:48,520
Scott: It's just north of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

547
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,459
Scott: A little bit west and a little bit north.

548
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,579
Rym: Yep, Emily and I got some family out there.

549
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,140
Scott: And that place is all about apples.

550
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,099
Scott: There are many apple orchards in range.

551
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,820
Scott: Short range of the little town of Warwick.

552
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,440
Scott: And so every year they have an apple festival.

553
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:10,580
Scott: That apple festival I think might have been cancelled during the dark times.

554
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,139
Scott: But I went to it once before.

555
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,240
Rym: I had been to it zero times before.

556
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,499
Rym: Because relatives, the same relatives we met when we went up there.

557
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:21,558
Rym: And we asked them this past weekend, "Hey, do you want to meet us

558
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:21,779
Rym: there?".

559
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:24,772
Rym: And their response was, "Fuck no.

560
00:36:25,194 --> 00:36:26,118
Rym: That's a crowded

561
00:36:26,198 --> 00:36:26,580
Rym: nightmare.".

562
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,480
Scott: Well I know you've been to Warwick, but you didn't go to the apple festival.

563
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:31,600
Rym: No, I have never been to the apple fest before.

564
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,920
Rym: Because in the past, I had the perception that it is extremely crowded.

565
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:36,599
Scott: It is crowded, yes.

566
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,220
Scott: So, we went to the apple festival again.

567
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:41,617
Scott: A second time.

568
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:44,300
Scott: Because I needed some fucking apples.

569
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,299
Scott: Apple season was coming to an end.

570
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,440
Scott: And usually you can go to the apple festival and then go to a nearby orchard.

571
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:54,800
Scott: Load up on apple, donuts, and cider.

572
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:58,420
Scott: And then go home and that's a lovely day on the weekend.

573
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,540
Rym: You want to talk about that first?

574
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,779
Rym: Because I was really looking forward to both of these aspects of this trip.

575
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,560
Rym: And after we're at the apple fest, and we'll review it in a moment.

576
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,518
Rym: You know, good old time.

577
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,080
Rym: We decide, let's go to an orchard.

578
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,999
Rym: And we look and we figure out which one to go to.

579
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,900
Scott: There's a lot of different orchards and all the orchards are different.

580
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:19,960
Scott: Some of them have tons of apples, but not too many exciting varieties.

581
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:23,460
Scott: Some of them specialize in having lots of varieties, but there's not a lot.

582
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:24,460
Scott: They're all different.

583
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,240
Scott: One of them's got this pizza.

584
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,240
Scott: One of them is like, you know, people are just partying out in the orchard.

585
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,160
Scott: Bringing out folding tables and letting their kids run wild.

586
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,100
Scott: And some of them, it's like, no, people are there for picking.

587
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,480
Scott: To get, you know, because they got to go make some apple shit.

588
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:43,840
Scott: And they don't let you hang out in the orchard and do other stuff, right?

589
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,580
Scott: You got to hang out in their, you know, hanging out area.

590
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:50,180
Scott: So each orchard has a different kind of specialty.

591
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,280
Scott: That they, you know, that's their thing.

592
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,320
Scott: To separate themselves from the competition.

593
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,020
Rym: Yup, and so we just, we pick one.

594
00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:58,558
Rym: The one that we wanted to go to.

595
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:01,720
Scott: The one we picked was the one I've been to before, twice.

596
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:03,120
Scott: It's a really happening one.

597
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,110
Rym: Yup, I'm 90% sure.

598
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,678
Rym: I've been to that one too.

599
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:09,458
Rym: I guess, the line of cars.

600
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:15,380
Rym: To get into this orchard, however long you think I'm going to say.

601
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,200
Rym: Like, put it up in order of magnitude.

602
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:27,500
Rym: It was like blocking traffic so far that we weren't sure if we could even get back toward the other side of where this orchard was to go to a different one.

603
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:33,240
Scott: It was hard to, it was hard to tell because it's like people are in line on a two lane road that, but it's not one way.

604
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:35,099
Scott: So it's like, yeah, everyone's lined up.

605
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,100
Scott: And it's like if you just wanted to continue down that road and go straight and not turn into the orchard.

606
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,640
Scott: You had to just wait in this line of cars that were all turning right into the orchard.

607
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,685
Rym: Yup, double yellow line.

608
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,880
Rym: You can't pass there safely or legally.

609
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,404
Scott: Yeah, it's like now.

610
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:51,152
Scott: there was a way to escape from that.

611
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:52,980
Scott: thanks to Google Maps got us out of there.

612
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,960
Rym: Yup, we took a serpentine path through a subdivision.

613
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:03,120
Scott: If you wanted to go in the same direction as those cars and you were beyond the turn, it's like you couldn't get it, you know.

614
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:11,600
Scott: It's like I thought about trying to pull a scam where it's like, well, if we're on the side road trying to pull in and make a left, someone's going to let us in eventually.

615
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:12,363
Scott: Right.

616
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:14,800
Scott: We're not just going to sit there for infinity.

617
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:22,860
Rym: I do think we would have sat there for infinity unless I took aggressive driving actions, the likes of which I am not personally willing to do.

618
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:23,502
Scott: Yeah.

619
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:27,100
Scott: So it's like, you know, yet so you have to let someone cut in line eventually.

620
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:29,860
Scott: And I bet you could lie and be like, no, no, no, I'm going to go straight.

621
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,284
Rym: Here's the problem, though.

622
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:32,007
Rym: Let's say we did.

623
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:34,959
Rym: We cut in line where we would have cut in.

624
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,293
Rym: I think the line was it was really long.

625
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:44,960
Rym: It was still very, very far, but at the point where we would have had to go into the orchard.

626
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:54,300
Rym: Now, the person who we told that we are just passing through would then see that we have, in fact, turned into the orchard and they are changed our minds.

627
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,519
Rym: They're now right behind us in traffic and they might have a gun.

628
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,282
Scott: Fight me, bro.

629
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:03,105
Scott: No.

630
00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:03,887
Scott: Yeah.

631
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:09,080
Scott: But I mean, on the one hand, the line was really long, but on the other hand, it was a car line.

632
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:17,439
Scott: And the thing to remember about a car line is that it's much longer than it appears to be, because most of the space in the line is taken up by car.

633
00:40:18,261 --> 00:40:24,320
Scott: The actual number of people in that line could have been like one hundred, like one hundred people waiting in line.

634
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,704
Scott: It takes up almost no room.

635
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:30,140
Scott: One hundred people in cars waiting in line is as long as one hundred cars.

636
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:38,660
Rym: But it's a long as, you know, based on looking at that line, it did not appear that it had moved any appreciable amount at any point.

637
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:39,643
Scott: Well, no.

638
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:43,920
Scott: See, that's the thing is like if we could have physically gotten to the orchard, we would have been fine.

639
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:44,462
Scott: Right.

640
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:49,640
Scott: But the because there's plenty of room for people at the orchard and parking was the reason for the line.

641
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,020
Rym: Even the orchard we ended up going to, we pull in and the parking guy like stand in there and he basically is like, yeah, you're fucked.

642
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,003
Rym: There's nowhere to park.

643
00:40:57,044 --> 00:40:59,233
Rym: You should just drive all the way in and turn around and get out.

644
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,780
Rym: And we did park and it was fine.

645
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,509
Rym: The guy was just really harried.

646
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:04,419
Rym: And I think he was just trying to get people to turn around.

647
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,546
Scott: I never saw somebody didn't want customers.

648
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:07,726
Scott: Right.

649
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:12,460
Scott: The other orchard with the mega line, you know, this orchard we went to didn't have a mega line.

650
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:12,641
Scott: Nope.

651
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,947
Scott: The one that did have the mega line.

652
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:15,152
Scott: They were turning people away.

653
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:16,940
Scott: They were like, yeah, keep this mega line going.

654
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,902
Scott: Give me that money.

655
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:18,785
Scott: Let's go.

656
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:24,280
Rym: I just I don't believe most of the people in that line based on how long it looked like it was.

657
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,940
Rym: And especially when I looked at Google and it showed a red line going off miles and miles and miles down that road.

658
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:35,416
Rym: I don't think most of those people could have even gotten into the orchard before it closed at five.

659
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:36,500
Scott: Who knows?

660
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:37,726
Rym: Because we we bailed.

661
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:38,389
Rym: We're not stupid.

662
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,495
Rym: We went to a different orchard.

663
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:40,138
Rym: Yeah.

664
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,670
Scott: A further an orchard further away from the festival.

665
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,000
Scott: Just like a restaurant further away from the convention.

666
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,461
Rym: Yeah.

667
00:41:46,561 --> 00:41:47,003
Rym: Has less.

668
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:47,806
Rym: Way less.

669
00:41:47,826 --> 00:41:51,480
Rym: We basically just got right in even despite the dire warnings of the parking lot attendant.

670
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:52,725
Rym: We got right in.

671
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:53,549
Scott: We got it.

672
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:55,639
Scott: But it was a. it was a not as good orchard.

673
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:55,920
Rym: Yeah.

674
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:00,977
Rym: It seems like that orchards main deal was apple alcohol, which fine.

675
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:01,780
Rym: Like I'm here for that.

676
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,800
Scott: I think if you were interested in alcohol that the orchard we went to would have been excellent, I assume.

677
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,284
Rym: Except the problem is the poison.

678
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:09,147
Rym: I was driving us.

679
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:11,556
Rym: So it's not like I could partake of the alcohol.

680
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:12,780
Scott: You could have bought some to take home.

681
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:15,949
Rym: But I wouldn't want to hang out in the orchard and drink the alcohol.

682
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,760
Rym: But also inside of this orchard, there weren't lines to do most things.

683
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,607
Rym: And there wasn't even a big line for the donuts.

684
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:22,069
Rym: It's just they.

685
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,640
Rym: they started selling the donuts at a specific time.

686
00:42:25,021 --> 00:42:27,326
Rym: And Scott got into near the front of that line.

687
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:28,128
Rym: So we were good there.

688
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:33,040
Rym: The line to get the apple poison was so long that I basically couldn't.

689
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:33,561
Rym: So I didn't.

690
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:34,265
Rym: I wouldn't bother.

691
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:37,019
Scott: Also, the donuts were not you know, they were fine, but they were not the best.

692
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,761
Rym: Yeah.

693
00:42:37,801 --> 00:42:40,267
Rym: I mean, even a bad cider donut is still good.

694
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,089
Rym: And those were like.

695
00:42:41,129 --> 00:42:45,499
Rym: those were, I'd say, B B level cider donuts, which is still great.

696
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,531
Rym: Like I will eat twelve B level cedar donuts.

697
00:42:48,671 --> 00:42:49,916
Rym: Cider donuts have no complaints.

698
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:50,760
Scott: Sure.

699
00:42:50,921 --> 00:42:55,740
Scott: Now, there is also Fishkill Farms, which is in Fishkill, New York, up near where we used to live in Beacon.

700
00:42:56,161 --> 00:43:02,920
Scott: And that farm, the way they solve their problem is they make you buy picking apple picking tickets in advance and they sell out.

701
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:03,482
Scott: Right.

702
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:06,293
Scott: So you could use some arbitrage and sell.

703
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,800
Scott: you sell your apple picking tickets.

704
00:43:08,401 --> 00:43:20,920
Rym: I think that is going to be more and more prevalent in the US in general, because something I've noticed post covid, things that used to be crowded, but not like terminally crowded are way more crowded lately.

705
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,020
Rym: And I think it's partly people who were stuck inside for three years, kind of just going apeshit and doing stuff.

706
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:29,272
Scott: There are many there are many, many reasons for these sorts of things.

707
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:31,220
Scott: But anyway, the Apple Festival.

708
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:31,561
Rym: Yes.

709
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:40,620
Rym: So the Apple Festival is about the scale of the equivalent non Apple Festival called Farm City Week that I used to go to every year as a kid in Michigan.

710
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:44,075
Rym: And I haven't been to a festival like that in a long time.

711
00:43:44,095 --> 00:43:45,100
Rym: So I was kind of here for it.

712
00:43:45,841 --> 00:43:51,220
Scott: It's like it's basically like the whole town is taken over by this Apple Festival.

713
00:43:51,480 --> 00:44:02,660
Scott: Even businesses like that are not directly connected to the Apple Festival and are thus cut off from most of the foot traffic are still putting stuff out and setting up tents.

714
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:09,320
Rym: And in every direction, like in the parking lot of the CVS, there was like a giant festival going on under a tent like.

715
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:09,881
Scott: Right.

716
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:16,200
Scott: It's like it's like none of those things are on the official festival map or are part of the festival technically.

717
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:23,420
Scott: But like every single business that was within range of the festival was getting involved somehow.

718
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,840
Scott: And it was effectively part of the festival because, you know, they got something going on.

719
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,402
Scott: They're trying to.

720
00:44:29,422 --> 00:44:30,406
Scott: you know, everyone's just.

721
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:31,752
Scott: it's like shit.

722
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,640
Scott: Tons of people are coming to our town.

723
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,620
Scott: We're going to squeeze every last drop of money out of them that we can.

724
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,452
Rym: So I wonder how many people attend this thing?

725
00:44:40,532 --> 00:44:41,236
Rym: because a lot.

726
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:42,804
Scott: Yeah.

727
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:43,789
Rym: I wonder how many.

728
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:44,252
Rym: Let's see.

729
00:44:44,372 --> 00:44:45,679
Rym: Attendance at.

730
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,000
Scott: It's going to be thousands, right?

731
00:44:48,763 --> 00:44:50,067
Rym: I could guess 10,000.

732
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:54,640
Rym: A lot of people roll into a thing, leave, and New York City people are all coming.

733
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,887
Rym: New York, Warwick, Apple Fest.

734
00:44:59,248 --> 00:45:00,170
Rym: What is the estimate?

735
00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:03,198
Rym: It's the largest Apple Festival.

736
00:45:03,258 --> 00:45:04,100
Rym: They don't give me a number.

737
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,904
Rym: It was a lot of people.

738
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:08,776
Rym: The population of this entire town is only 6,000 people.

739
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:10,782
Scott: Yeah.

740
00:45:11,945 --> 00:45:16,480
Rym: So I feel like a multiple of this town might have showed up for the day or at least for a portion of the festival.

741
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:27,260
Rym: But, you know, in terms of the poisonous aspects of cars in America, there is no way to get to this town except by car.

742
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:36,920
Rym: And there is not enough parking even for the people who live in this town, let alone thousands and thousands and thousands of New York City folk all driving up to go to this Apple Festival.

743
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:45,680
Rym: So they set up gigantic parking lots on the edge of town and a constant line of school buses taking people from their cars to the festival.

744
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:46,960
Scott: Yep.

745
00:45:47,061 --> 00:45:48,266
Scott: It's very intelligent of them.

746
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:51,600
Scott: It's like, well, you know, we need a parking lot, but we only need it once a year.

747
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,760
Scott: And no one's going to school on fucking Saturday, even if school season has started.

748
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,880
Rym: And the school, because everyone gets to the school and cars, has a massive parking lot.

749
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:01,862
Scott: Correct.

750
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:07,340
Scott: So it's like they just use the school's parking lot and they bus people to the festival and they charge ten bucks for it.

751
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,345
Scott: And yeah, that's like.

752
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:10,188
Scott: that's just smart.

753
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,160
Scott: I think that's actually something that bothers me a lot that I see.

754
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:23,980
Scott: And even in New York City is that, for example, you have a school in New York City that has many facilities, lots of facilities that are all paid for and are run by the Department of Education.

755
00:46:24,622 --> 00:46:29,360
Scott: But those are facilities even in the summer when they are not in use at all.

756
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,061
Scott: Right.

757
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,220
Scott: Or at night when they are not in use at all by any school.

758
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,183
Scott: And there's no students.

759
00:46:34,223 --> 00:46:38,940
Scott: there are basically off limits, even though they are public property.

760
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:44,720
Scott: No other members of the public can make any use of them because it's only for school.

761
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:49,471
Scott: And in the summer, you have like a huge field that's just empty and unused.

762
00:46:49,732 --> 00:46:52,900
Scott: that could be like temporarily handed over to the Parks Department.

763
00:46:53,100 --> 00:47:04,680
Scott: And then if somebody wanted to put the effort in, but in a small town, right, where there's less resources to manage and there aren't so many separate departments, right, managing everything.

764
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:12,860
Scott: It's like, yeah, we can just use our school building for fucking everything that we put a lot of the town's money into building this building.

765
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:13,764
Rym: Okay, I found a number.

766
00:47:13,784 --> 00:47:16,475
Rym: The Warwick Applefest claims 30,000 people go on average.

767
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,086
Scott: Not bad.

768
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:18,736
Rym: Not bad.

769
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,380
Rym: So several, many times the population of the entire town.

770
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,925
Scott: Yep.

771
00:47:26,085 --> 00:47:27,188
Scott: So yeah, you go there.

772
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:28,271
Scott: And what do they have?

773
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,280
Scott: Obviously, delicious foods of many, many varieties.

774
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:33,945
Scott: Even in New York City, right?

775
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:38,520
Scott: Obviously, if you take all the food of New York City, the Apple Festival can't compete.

776
00:47:38,881 --> 00:47:41,949
Scott: But there is in New York City, the street fair.

777
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:46,080
Scott: There is a street fair that basically is always in existence.

778
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,847
Scott: It just moves constantly.

779
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:50,480
Scott: And it has mostly the robot carnival.

780
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,066
Scott: Yeah, it has mostly the same vendors, but not always.

781
00:47:54,186 --> 00:48:01,260
Scott: But it mostly they basically every different weekend day holiday, you could just there's a website that tells you exactly where it's going to be.

782
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,880
Scott: But even if you don't check that website, if you just bike around New York City, you're likely to run into it.

783
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:08,020
Scott: If it's not a weekday.

784
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:12,440
Rym: Every now and then it's near my office and I walk outside and I bump into it and guess where I eat lunch?

785
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:14,907
Scott: Yeah, it's in my neighborhood frequently.

786
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:18,620
Scott: But the food, it has, you know, carny festival food.

787
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:24,640
Scott: The Warwick Apple Festival food is better than the New York every weekend street fair food.

788
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:25,799
Rym: Absolutely better.

789
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:26,857
Scott: By a lot.

790
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:34,100
Rym: In fact, my only regret is that I did not eat more of the food, but I am 41 years old and my stomach can only hold so much food.

791
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:39,060
Scott: The problem is it's like I really, really want to try all the different foods at the at the festival.

792
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:47,340
Scott: But unlike, say, the the night market in the night market, it's like everyone's making small dishes for like five bucks each.

793
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,220
Scott: You can get a lot of them and you can share them if you go to the Apple Festival and you don't have a lot of people with you.

794
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,072
Scott: It's like you get one thing from one cart and it's like more.

795
00:48:57,172 --> 00:49:00,400
Scott: it's like ten bucks or more and they give you a pile of food.

796
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:09,480
Rym: And it's like, I guess the amount of Polish food they handed me when I ordered one plate of Polish food that is intended for one person was that was three people of food.

797
00:49:10,103 --> 00:49:11,579
Scott: That was two and a half at least.

798
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,579
Rym: That was that was a terrifying amount of food.

799
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:18,593
Scott: It's like, don't you want me to like, you know, give more money?

800
00:49:18,954 --> 00:49:20,480
Scott: It's like you should be giving out less food.

801
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,760
Rym: If you had given me a third of the food on that plate, it's still for the same price, for the same price.

802
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:26,839
Rym: And I would not have complained.

803
00:49:27,624 --> 00:49:30,640
Scott: And you would have gone to some other booth and also patronize them as well.

804
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:34,865
Scott: Anyway, so, yeah, lots of delicious foods.

805
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:43,000
Scott: You can get doughnuts, you can get pies, you can get apple poison, you can get cookies, you can get Polish food and your barbecue and fucking everything.

806
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:50,880
Rym: There's also a lot of quaint small town charm vending, but it seems to be almost exclusively.

807
00:49:52,762 --> 00:49:56,620
Rym: I'm going to say I don't mean this uncharitably low tier arts and crafts.

808
00:49:57,365 --> 00:49:58,240
Scott: Yes, that's what it is.

809
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,480
Rym: Or candles.

810
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:00,800
Scott: Yep.

811
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:12,897
Scott: Well, anytime you go to any craft fair, including the Every Weekend New York Street Fair, any kind of fair, the things you will always see a lot of are people who make candles, soap, jewelry.

812
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,531
Scott: Those are the big pottery.

813
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:18,459
Scott: Those are the big four.

814
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:21,820
Rym: Now the pottery was some of the better pottery I've seen at a festival like this.

815
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:22,062
Rym: Oh, yeah.

816
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:24,620
Scott: The quality of those varies wildly.

817
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,629
Scott: But like those are the four things you're going to see the most frequently.

818
00:50:28,649 --> 00:50:33,480
Scott: There's like the most, you know, small time, you know, independent little crafty people.

819
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,206
Rym: How many candles can people burn?

820
00:50:35,386 --> 00:50:39,400
Rym: If I have a bar of soap, it lasts like two or three months.

821
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,286
Scott: People like, you know, I think.

822
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,558
Scott: the other thing is you got to think people have like big houses, right?

823
00:50:45,598 --> 00:50:46,060
Scott: Not like us.

824
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,799
Rym: I only have a closet full of soap.

825
00:50:48,322 --> 00:50:50,391
Scott: Well, if they got a lot of bathrooms, right?

826
00:50:50,432 --> 00:50:52,300
Scott: You ever go into like some suburban house?

827
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,279
Rym: Oh, and they got the bad, the unused bathroom.

828
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,360
Scott: There's like some bathroom that like is not used too often.

829
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:03,660
Scott: And you go in there because you're a guest and it's a convenient spot and you go in there and they always have a weird soap in there.

830
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,840
Scott: It's like, should I use this soap or is it a decorative soap?

831
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:14,335
Rym: My aunt literally like got mad at us when I was a kid once because we use the like the bathroom that nobody uses.

832
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:16,840
Rym: that had the fancy towels and the fancy soap in it.

833
00:51:17,302 --> 00:51:20,040
Rym: And we use the soap that was supposed to be decorative.

834
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:29,300
Rym: That was a long time ago, but the candles too, like it takes a long time to burn a candle down and nothing.

835
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,700
Rym: And yet candles seem to be the hottest commodity at this festival.

836
00:51:34,203 --> 00:51:36,020
Scott: Well, I think people love to make candles.

837
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:45,220
Scott: And also, you know, you can make a candle even if you are just making candles, you can come up with like a smell that isn't exactly like anyone else's candle.

838
00:51:45,422 --> 00:51:45,644
Scott: Right.

839
00:51:45,664 --> 00:51:47,239
Scott: Because there's so much variety you can do.

840
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,460
Scott: So even if you're small time in the candle game, you can get, you know, you might be able to make a sale if someone comes along and they're like, wow, I never seen, you know, that particular smell.

841
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,900
Rym: Plus, it's way easy to make soy candles in the year 2023, like without a lot of skills and equipment compared to more traditional kinds of candles.

842
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:10,011
Rym: And what I did not see were any traditional candles.

843
00:52:10,152 --> 00:52:13,120
Rym: It was only like modern, quick to make soy candles.

844
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:14,301
Scott: Yep.

845
00:52:14,863 --> 00:52:20,960
Scott: And the other thing is that there are people out there who literally are burning at least one candle just fucking all the time.

846
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:21,926
Rym: That is true.

847
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:23,099
Rym: That is not me.

848
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,760
Rym: But I know you're out there.

849
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,460
Scott: There are candle people out there who just have a candle going always.

850
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:28,542
Scott: Yep.

851
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:34,336
Rym: I like a candle occasionally, but also if a candle's burning, I got to turn off all the air filters because all the air filters are like, what the fuck?

852
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:35,258
Rym: Everyone's going to die.

853
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:36,020
Rym: Nine, nine, nine.

854
00:52:37,061 --> 00:52:37,202
Scott: Yeah.

855
00:52:37,242 --> 00:52:40,238
Scott: I mean, maybe burning a candle all the time isn't that good for you.

856
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:40,560
Rym: Who knows?

857
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,340
Rym: Probably not.

858
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,808
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, you know, it's one of those things where it's like.

859
00:52:46,848 --> 00:52:51,200
Scott: I look at all these crafts and some of them are meh and some of them it's like, ooh, look at that.

860
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,020
Scott: But I end up not buying basically anything.

861
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:54,721
Rym: Yep.

862
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:56,346
Rym: You know what, though, is I actually?

863
00:52:56,366 --> 00:53:01,000
Rym: it's about the same thing that I do in artist alleys and conventions.

864
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,040
Rym: The odds of me buying something at an artist alley in a convention are effectively zero.

865
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:10,320
Rym: Like you're going to see me buy a lottery ticket more often than I buy anything at an artist alley.

866
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:13,129
Rym: But I really like to look around an artist alley.

867
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:16,018
Rym: I'll spend all day looking at every single booth to see what their deal is.

868
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,522
Rym: And that's the same thing.

869
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:20,506
Rym: I like a good time to walk around.

870
00:53:20,546 --> 00:53:28,540
Rym: I'm not too jaded as a fancy pants rich New York podcast dude to head upstate and go to a quaint town festival and mooch around for a few hours.

871
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,622
Scott: So there's two other things about the festival.

872
00:53:30,723 --> 00:53:45,480
Scott: One of them is that since it sort of sprawls over the whole town and not just this main area, there's one like road that is basically they remove the cars from the road because it connects like the main festival area from the town park, which has like a pond.

873
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:48,247
Scott: And so they are a road that connects them.

874
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:52,960
Scott: They basically block that road so that people can walk between the two locations.

875
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:59,671
Scott: And everyone who lives along that road is setting up booths and shit.

876
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:05,020
Scott: Even people who just live there are putting like that's the day they come out with their tag sale trying to sell their shit.

877
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,340
Scott: Right.

878
00:54:05,421 --> 00:54:11,711
Scott: It's like everyone is getting in on, you know, the church is on that road or like getting in on it, setting up booths.

879
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:12,412
Scott: Right.

880
00:54:12,572 --> 00:54:17,020
Scott: It's like they're all like, whoo, people are foot traffic is going to be here today.

881
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,167
Scott: Therefore, this residential road is now a commercial road.

882
00:54:21,187 --> 00:54:21,648
Scott: Let's go.

883
00:54:21,668 --> 00:54:26,779
Rym: The thing is, imagine how cool that town would be if that road just didn't have cars on it.

884
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:31,727
Scott: Well, I'm just saying, but it's like, I'm just, it's really cool to like, sort of like.

885
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:35,232
Scott: imagine if everyone in the street you live on one day, just.

886
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:40,240
Scott: everyone goes up and sets a booth up outside their house and you have like a, you know, not just a block party.

887
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,526
Rym: So that actually used to happen when I was a kid, you know, I lived in Detroit.

888
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:50,440
Rym: So we had a neighborhood tag sale day where everyone did their garage sales on the same day.

889
00:54:50,560 --> 00:55:03,578
Rym: So it became like, but we also had a couple, every year we had one or two, uh, basically like block parties where every house put a booth with something going on in front of their house.

890
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:05,360
Rym: Like some houses did an arts and crafts thing.

891
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,663
Rym: Some houses would do like a haunted house thing.

892
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,827
Rym: Some houses would just have food that was free.

893
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:11,469
Rym: Some houses would do a garage sale.

894
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:17,840
Rym: Some people would sell stuff, but every house like did a thing on this day for this like local block party festival.

895
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:23,273
Scott: And the last thing I want to say, which will probably make someone mad at me, but whatever.

896
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:25,480
Scott: It's just the truth that I can't deny.

897
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,871
Rym: I can't wait to hear what you have to say.

898
00:55:26,891 --> 00:55:27,639
Rym: Cause I actually don't know.

899
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,206
Scott: So the Apple festival has many live musical performances, which is great.

900
00:55:32,306 --> 00:55:33,007
Scott: That's terrific.

901
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:33,207
Scott: Right?

902
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,110
Scott: They were like, there's way more than you think.

903
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,592
Scott: Like the park has one.

904
00:55:36,873 --> 00:55:41,500
Scott: Then the church has gone as like, it's like a random fiddling guy on the main street.

905
00:55:41,942 --> 00:55:44,680
Scott: And then there's a, I think a Z-Boat is another performance.

906
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,605
Rym: The fiddling guy was better than the average fiddler I hear in New York.

907
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:48,887
Scott: Oh yeah.

908
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:50,369
Scott: It could actually fiddle.

909
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,112
Scott: People were jigging, doing a jig.

910
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:53,975
Rym: I jigged a little walking past him.

911
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:54,637
Rym: I could not help.

912
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:55,718
Rym: It was, it was too powerful.

913
00:55:55,758 --> 00:55:56,139
Rym: The jig.

914
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,640
Rym: Yeah.

915
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:02,110
Scott: They had a person on a horse and a headless horseman costume you could photo with.

916
00:56:02,631 --> 00:56:04,796
Rym: An S-tier beautiful horse too.

917
00:56:04,856 --> 00:56:06,840
Rym: Like this was a particularly good looking horse.

918
00:56:07,341 --> 00:56:07,541
Scott: Yeah.

919
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:10,225
Scott: There was a rock band that was in the park by the pond.

920
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:11,426
Scott: That was pretty good actually.

921
00:56:11,446 --> 00:56:20,920
Scott: Um, you know, I didn't listen to every performance and hang around all day, but one, the one, when we got, we first arrived and we got off the school bus after the parking lot.

922
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:28,511
Scott: There were clearly people who were either community theater or high school theater drama club people singing show tunes.

923
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:29,012
Scott: Right?

924
00:56:29,312 --> 00:56:31,856
Scott: Now they were quite good singers, right?

925
00:56:31,876 --> 00:56:34,680
Scott: They could sing about 10,000 times better than I can.

926
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,622
Rym: About 20,000 times better than I can.

927
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:37,523
Rym: Yeah.

928
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:37,763
Scott: Right.

929
00:56:37,783 --> 00:56:41,407
Scott: It's like, you know, they were, and they, they were singing the show tunes properly.

930
00:56:41,547 --> 00:56:45,731
Scott: They had talents and skills and their performance was enjoyable.

931
00:56:46,592 --> 00:56:48,914
Scott: And, uh, I was not upset that they were there.

932
00:56:48,954 --> 00:56:53,018
Scott: We, we, we ate the Polish food in, in their vicinity to hear them.

933
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:54,740
Scott: Uh, it was very nice.

934
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,984
Rym: However, we live in New York, however, I live in New York.

935
00:56:59,044 --> 00:56:59,264
Scott: Right.

936
00:56:59,344 --> 00:57:07,391
Scott: And I realized it made me realize it was like riding the small roller coaster after riding only the big roller coaster.

937
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:07,732
Scott: Right.

938
00:57:08,212 --> 00:57:16,399
Scott: I, I had become spoiled and taken for granted that like the only shows I've been to in recent years are.

939
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,204
Scott: Metropolitan opera, actual Broadway theater, right?

940
00:57:21,444 --> 00:57:23,566
Scott: Radio city music, right?

941
00:57:23,786 --> 00:57:27,970
Scott: It's like touring bands that are huge jazz band.

942
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,652
Rym: We see it at Lincoln center.

943
00:57:30,453 --> 00:57:30,693
Scott: Right.

944
00:57:30,753 --> 00:57:38,020
Scott: It's like, I've been spoiled living in New York city, basically only feasting on the foie gras of music.

945
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:45,965
Rym: When I ever talk about Cedar point, cause once you've been there, like no other roller coaster is even like it's there.

946
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:51,769
Rym: They're fine roller coasters, but they're beneath the scale of notice to someone who has even been to Cedar point.

947
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:52,410
Scott: Right.

948
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,791
Scott: But it's like, I had forgotten.

949
00:57:54,211 --> 00:57:54,431
Scott: Right.

950
00:57:54,491 --> 00:57:55,052
Scott: The difference.

951
00:57:55,332 --> 00:57:55,592
Scott: Right.

952
00:57:55,832 --> 00:58:06,040
Scott: And so it, it, it provided this stark reminder that like, yeah, you know, you went to the opera and it sounded like someone was playing a CD, but even better somehow.

953
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,846
Scott: And it's like, you know, whereas this had a little bit of that karaoke sound in it.

954
00:58:11,026 --> 00:58:11,286
Scott: Right.

955
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:12,487
Scott: That wasn't so great.

956
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:23,080
Scott: And it's like, you know, it didn't ruin it, but it's just like, you could tell the difference right between the S tier that you had and the maybe a or B plus tier that you're having now.

957
00:58:23,721 --> 00:58:25,704
Scott: And it reminded me, Oh, right.

958
00:58:25,864 --> 00:58:32,655
Scott: I am very privileged to live in New York city and enjoy the finest that the world has to offer.

959
00:58:33,116 --> 00:58:34,719
Scott: You know, there, there is a difference.

960
00:58:34,819 --> 00:58:35,460
Scott: It's not the same.

961
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,000
Scott: Yeah.

962
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:48,971
Rym: And I can, we can enjoy that finest writing a few stops on a subway two hours north, but it was valuable because in fact I'm going to the opera a week from Saturday.

963
00:58:49,171 --> 00:58:49,691
Scott: Right.

964
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,394
Scott: And so I will not take for granted.

965
00:58:52,414 --> 00:58:53,154
Scott: Right.

966
00:58:53,935 --> 00:59:00,320
Scott: Uh, you know, the difference between rubbing, I guess, honey on my ears and just raw sugar.

967
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:07,006
Rym: But, uh, yeah, I'd say the Warwick Apple Fest is a perfectly fine, fun town festival.

968
00:59:07,146 --> 00:59:10,170
Rym: I'd like, I, I like town festivals.

969
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,211
Rym: I like that kind of thing.

970
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,912
Rym: I like that five.

971
00:59:11,972 --> 00:59:16,838
Rym: I like seeing a community of people like putting on a thing and being proud of it.

972
00:59:16,978 --> 00:59:18,620
Rym: Like I just, I enjoy everything about that.

973
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:25,934
Rym: My only worry is that it's going to only get more crowded because Warwick can't get bigger yet.

974
00:59:26,035 --> 00:59:28,500
Rym: New York city's influence grows evermore.

975
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,566
Scott: I mean they could block off more of their roads and expand, right?

976
00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:34,507
Scott: The festival that way.

977
00:59:34,808 --> 00:59:35,729
Scott: Um, so yeah.

978
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:37,832
Scott: Would I go back to the Warwick Apple Festival?

979
00:59:37,892 --> 00:59:38,172
Scott: Yes.

980
00:59:38,232 --> 00:59:40,075
Scott: Would I go every year and like make a point of it?

981
00:59:40,175 --> 00:59:40,496
Scott: No.

982
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:41,217
Scott: Right.

983
00:59:41,357 --> 00:59:43,620
Scott: It's kind of a hassle to get out there.

984
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,025
Rym: I want to try to like bring all our people and like, yeah,

985
00:59:48,566 --> 00:59:59,700
Scott: I think what I'm going to do next year is I'm going to go back to the, the Fishkill Orchard, um, you know, which where you make the, where you make an appointment because they have the, the top tier donut.

986
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:04,780
Rym: Yeah, I could use an, I like the donuts we got, but I could use an S tier donut.

987
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,856
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Rym: I'm not sure what the stinger is going to be.

997
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:14,190
Rym: I'm going to go eat some dinner first, and then I'm going to pick something weird, and I'm going to stick it right after the point where I stop talking.
