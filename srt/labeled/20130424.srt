00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,605
Rym: It's Wednesday April 24th 2013.

2
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:17,982
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight the anime we're not watching.

3
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:25,649
Rym: let's do this all right.

4
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:34,379
Scott: so I think it's just about Oh near the end of April so it's time to curse the Mets because they're not doing the worst.

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,243
Rym: you know every.

6
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:36,168
Scott: make sure they do the worst.

7
00:00:36,188 --> 00:00:38,638
Rym: every year season starts.

8
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:40,988
Rym: either someone links it to me or whatever.

9
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:42,032
Rym: it's in a forum somewhere.

10
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:42,715
Rym: it's on Farc.

11
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:53,552
Rym: there's just that video of Stewie Griffin and family guys sitting down for a baseball game and at the announcer's like and it's opening season and the Mets have lost and then he's like throws his head down and walks away.

12
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:55,118
Scott: yep that's how it is so.

13
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:58,010
Scott: but anyway we have a pitcher on our team.

14
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:03,168
Scott: his name's Matt Harvey right and he's apparently like the best.

15
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:04,777
Scott: he's pretty much the best pitcher there is.

16
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,306
Scott: he just showed up out of nowhere.

17
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:11,416
Rym: it doesn't mean much though because I mean there was a point where the Tigers had a great pitcher didn't really win.

18
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:12,961
Rym: yeah.

19
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:21,197
Scott: so I thought of talking about this as an opening bit because I saw a guy on the subway just now wearing a Matt Harvey jersey and the.

20
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:23,766
Scott: he didn't go to the.

21
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:26,135
Scott: he thought he was gonna get on the seven and go to the game but he didn't.

22
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:30,874
Scott: okay well you got off at Queensborough Plaza and he went somewhere.

23
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,603
Rym: you know you thought he was.

24
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:35,983
Scott: I thought you said he thought like I got he was going to the game.

25
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,664
Rym: and I'm like what you said that I thought he thought he was going to the game and then didn't.

26
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:41,914
Rym: and I was like how could you even know?

27
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:47,580
Scott: no it's like you see someone going on the seven train platform wearing a lot of Mets.

28
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:53,956
Scott: shit you think they're gonna get on the seven train especially when the game is gonna start at like 710. right he could easily made it to that game on time.

29
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:56,065
Scott: he was on the train.

30
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,773
Scott: that was the perfect way to get to the game.

31
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:02,857
Rym: I would posit that that's only the case if he's also loud and or belligerent on the train.

32
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,970
Scott: no that's on the way home after but anyway.

33
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,698
Scott: so you know the thing is right.

34
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:10,021
Scott: my dad's name is Harvey.

35
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:18,304
Scott: so we usually have a no Jersey buying policy because if you buy if you know if I buy a Matt Harvey Jersey guess it's gonna happen he's gonna break his arm.

36
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:19,451
Scott: right it's guaranteed.

37
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:24,592
Scott: it's basically saying hey sporting goods store I will pay you I don't know.

38
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,242
Scott: what do they cost like 75 to 100 bucks.

39
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:30,729
Scott: I'll give you a hundred bucks if you can make sure the Matt Harvey breaks his arm like in the next week.

40
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,094
Scott: so thank you.

41
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,883
Scott: here have a free Jersey as a token.

42
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:37,452
Rym: see hockey has such the opposite culture.

43
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:41,635
Rym: like you buy the Jersey of the guy that you are sure is going to live forever and he will.

44
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:44,870
Rym: I mean I still have a Fedorov Jersey and I was good Jersey.

45
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,602
Rym: I think even have a Vernon Jersey laying around.

46
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:47,991
Scott: you should have bought a jogger Jersey.

47
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:49,016
Scott: he's we can live forever.

48
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:52,792
Rym: anyway my brother has a thing in Constantine off.

49
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:56,590
Scott: my dad can buy a Matt Harvey Jersey because at least for him it'll be good.

50
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,952
Scott: even if Matt Harvey like gets hit by a bus he'll still be like because it says Harvey.

51
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:02,018
Rym: huh so it's Harvey.

52
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,772
Rym: we're in the Harvey Jersey drinking a Harvey wall banger.

53
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:17,343
Rym: sure though I you know it's kind of a random aside but I was uh you know I have this like I don't know whitewater rafting Jersey that I just have that I wear when I go skiing like over my under armor but

54
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:18,247
Scott: a white one yeah

55
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:19,914
Rym: but under my ski jacket.

56
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:25,603
Rym: so when I'm like in the lodge I have something on other than just my undershirt basically and it's for warmth and whatever.

57
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:26,910
Rym: no one ever commented on it.

58
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,464
Rym: it's totally utilitarian kind of old and stained and worn out.

59
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:39,282
Rym: the last few times I went skiing I started wearing my Fedorov red wings Jersey instead and apparently red wings jerseys are girl magnets.

60
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:49,419
Rym: okay because once I was wearing that instead of my white Jersey girls would hit on me at the bar after I was skiing before I got on the bus home reliably.

61
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,226
Scott: it is a ski lodge.

62
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,396
Scott: yeah what do you think they do there?

63
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:54,321
Scott: they're not skiing.

64
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:57,156
Scott: they're always like the only one who's going there to ski.

65
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:00,474
Rym: or they're from upstate New York or they're from there like local.

66
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:08,656
Scott: you are the only one who is at the ski lodge for skiing except for that old guy with the crazy not matching clothes and the young kid on the bunny slope right.

67
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:10,063
Scott: so and the ski patrol?

68
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:11,168
Rym: I've talked about this a lot.

69
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:12,595
Rym: well not a lot but I brought it up often.

70
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:24,564
Rym: but now that I've gotten past the middle point of the show I want to give a kind of for real review of from the new world or Shinsekai Ori because I've seen enough now to know that it is a good show.

71
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:31,449
Rym: in the very least the worst-case scenario this is a b-plus anime like beaten-out scrap princess.

72
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:35,358
Scott: is this the one that had a porny manga or was it the pointy at it?

73
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:47,137
Rym: okay there is a it's complicated I'll put it this way what this show is about and I believe it's based on some light novels.

74
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,187
Rym: there may be a manga in other words porn.

75
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:50,733
Rym: no no so here's the deal.

76
00:04:51,577 --> 00:04:54,287
Rym: people say that but it's actually a plot point.

77
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,798
Rym: that's kind of zebra storyteller ition.

78
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:01,358
Rym: interesting the plot of this show is that sounds like a true bra excuse.

79
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,583
Rym: okay so hear me out.

80
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:11,621
Rym: in the in the nearing future some sort of modern society like today suddenly out of nowhere people start manifesting psychic powers like x-men style.

81
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:16,925
Rym: but imagine if everyone had Jean Grey's powers great automatically the end of the world.

82
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:17,166
Scott: so.

83
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:20,139
Rym: and the opening montage is horrifying.

84
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:25,102
Rym: like a kid just suddenly everyone around him explodes in piles of blood and yeah ours are just flying everywhere.

85
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:27,453
Rym: society basically falls apart.

86
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,702
Scott: so it's a lot like what's it called.

87
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:36,828
Scott: that's the cute town that's actually murderville with the labor unions or whatever it was.

88
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:39,378
Scott: what are you talking about that anime where?

89
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:45,479
Rym: oh oh the one with Colonel Sanders when they cry yeah yeah as a million sequels.

90
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:49,089
Rym: I kind of liked that show and I show one episode.

91
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,002
Rym: I was about to say that shows relevant to our topic today's indeed.

92
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:56,317
Rym: so you made me lose my train of thought there.

93
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:56,478
Rym: right.

94
00:05:56,498 --> 00:05:58,048
Rym: so since I got yours so this happens.

95
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:10,328
Rym: you just get like this sort of montage of this happening and then the show just starts with a bunch of kids in elementary school into what looks like old Japan but with a few anachronistic modern technologies laying about.

96
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:15,663
Rym: so it's a prequel to Adventure Time and it's weird and you're not really sure what's going on.

97
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:21,166
Rym: and basically the plot is that society Futurama style.

98
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:29,158
Rym: remember when you see that that montage where he's frozen and like society gets destroyed by aliens castles aliens destroy the castles.

99
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:30,403
Rym: the same thing happens.

100
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:53,645
Rym: society kind of rebuilds over time and eventually the society that works is based on this amalgam of old cultures and hypnotism and eugenics and societal structures set up in place to allow humans who had basically have Jean Grey's powers to coexist with each other and not accidentally murder everybody.

101
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:55,772
Rym: okay and it works really well.

102
00:06:56,755 --> 00:07:01,995
Rym: and but at the same time the eugenics is to such a degree because the danger is.

103
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,843
Scott: so let's see this baby up.

104
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,349
Scott: this is dangerous baby kill it.

105
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,880
Rym: yeah there's a point where you find out.

106
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:28,748
Rym: you find out from I guess the Ethics Committee that they changed the Constitution or the rules of the society so that the dates before which is legal to abort someone is moved from like a week or two after birth to the age of 17.

107
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:34,832
Scott: and in case they discover somebody's gonna destroy the world by accident they say you know the way I would describe this show.

108
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:43,437
Rym: really is it's a post apocalyptic psychic 1984. all right and it's really good.

109
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,723
Rym: and the reason it's really good.

110
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:59,635
Rym: I want to compare it to another show we tried to watch and didn't watch called number six because number six started out in kind of the same way in the sense that all right there's some awesome stuff here there's some kind of mystery of space there's all the stuff that I care about.

111
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:02,147
Rym: and then that show just went nowhere.

112
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:05,946
Rym: it had like the worst pacing like it got to a point of all right.

113
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:07,295
Rym: now it's time to move on to the next thing.

114
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:09,852
Rym: and then it stayed on a thing for so long that I stopped watching.

115
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,421
Scott: I noticed this theme a lot in anime.

116
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:14,292
Scott: number six ergo proxy Raza fon of the.

117
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:19,694
Scott: you know there is a an evil 1984 society in a dome and something else going on outside the dome.

118
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:23,975
Scott: big oh big oh has the same thing but it some shows like number six.

119
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:30,259
Rym: as soon as they get outside of the dome the plot just goes nowhere and the end is stupid.

120
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,103
Rym: Emily spoiled it for me.

121
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:32,470
Rym: I'm glad I didn't watch number six.

122
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,092
Rym: fuck that show.

123
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:44,968
Rym: so the reason this show is good one is pretty good music - it escalates rapidly and it time skips several times.

124
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,654
Scott: and where's all this porn come in?

125
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:51,961
Rym: okay so one of the aspects of the show is that basically the plot like you don't know what's going on.

126
00:08:52,002 --> 00:09:07,854
Rym: they just keep showing you vignettes from different eras of history like at one point it cuts to some point that looks older than the current time in the show but much newer than the apocalypse and it looks like a traditional Japanese like this is the new Emperor.

127
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:19,848
Rym: and then the Emperor uses psychic power to float over the crowd and very happily announces that they're that in celebration of the inauguration of his eternal reign the first hundred people to stop clapping will be executed.

128
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:25,873
Rym: and then later you see a flashback of later than that someone assassinating him.

129
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:36,841
Rym: and it keeps going back and forth current day and these weird sort of flashbacks to things that happened in this society and then eventually the kids who are kind of the focus of the show.

130
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:42,306
Rym: they're like the main characters go on a school trip and they go kind of outside where they're supposed to.

131
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:50,804
Rym: they find a library and they get zebra storyteller because the library is like yeah your society is designed eugenics eugenics eugenics.

132
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:52,532
Rym: babies get murdered and they're like what.

133
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:54,884
Rym: and they learn things like.

134
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:56,313
Rym: here's an example I get.

135
00:09:56,353 --> 00:09:57,420
Rym: the show kind of goes really in-depth.

136
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,756
Rym: there's a point at which they skipped over all the porn part.

137
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:00,982
Rym: I'm getting to the porn part.

138
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:05,057
Rym: so they learn that humans have this sort of.

139
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:06,082
Scott: just tell everyone the whole show.

140
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:07,211
Scott: you've been going on for like 10 minutes.

141
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:09,285
Rym: yeah cuz this is not the spoiler stuff.

142
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:10,433
Rym: you sort of learned that like.

143
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:14,313
Rym: one of the ways the society works is that humans cannot harm things that look like humans.

144
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:20,305
Scott: mm-hmm that's like embedded deep into the psyche of all except for that kid who just made out everyone explode around.

145
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:21,572
Rym: that was way before.

146
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:23,863
Rym: that was before this new society existed.

147
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,571
Rym: okay that was like modern times.

148
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,122
Rym: it's like today kid in the street get psychic powers.

149
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:40,942
Rym: one of those things is that what is implanted into humans is very sort of specific sexual needs and progression such that they won't get pregnant.

150
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:47,478
Rym: or have you know the urges that might cause them to lash out until they're ready and then they'll sort of immediately pair off and have babies.

151
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:53,037
Rym: and in stressful situations they took genes and brain things from bonobos.

152
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:59,902
Rym: so people will respond to stressful situations with pleasure or sex rather than violence.

153
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:04,140
Scott: so in other words they created that plot point just to put lots of porn.

154
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,171
Rym: no they actually don't really show that at all.

155
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:11,359
Scott: then why are all these pictures of the show really sort of perverted looking like all the other anime?

156
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,824
Rym: I really don't know because I've seen 14 episodes of the show and that's not there at all.

157
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,334
Rym: there is literally nothing like that in the show.

158
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:25,993
Rym: okay there is one point where one of the girls is in a relationship with another one of the girls because that's how the society set up.

159
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:29,634
Rym: they don't want to have babies yet so they're all kind of automatically homosexual.

160
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:30,821
Rym: but the show that's just part of the.

161
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:31,666
Rym: you know what's going on.

162
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:36,916
Rym: suddenly the girls like because she knows about the bonobo thing she wants to kiss the other girls.

163
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:38,282
Rym: she's like wait a minute wait a minute.

164
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,007
Rym: this is just the society.

165
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:52,896
Rym: psychic bullshit 1984. and these kids are all sort of zebra storytellers and the ethics committees and everything are watching them and it's just like 1984 but they have psychic powers.

166
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:54,844
Rym: yeah everyone has psychic powers.

167
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,430
Scott: yes it's like a battle time.

168
00:11:57,374 --> 00:11:58,640
Rym: they can't battle each other.

169
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:04,827
Rym: because of that thing where you can't hurt other humans physically prevented from doing so you basically die.

170
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:08,702
Rym: if you try to do it the show is really really good.

171
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,029
Scott: I'll just knock this building down.

172
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:10,934
Scott: I was hurting the building.

173
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:13,207
Rym: that's also very difficult to do that.

174
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:16,789
Rym: I mean I'm trying to skip stuff because you wanted me to not talk about the show too much.

175
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,243
Rym: anyway I'll put it this way the show is really well done.

176
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,368
Scott: no reason to watch the show now.

177
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,209
Rym: really well animated escalates very rapidly every time.

178
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,660
Rym: I think alright now the show is gonna get boring.

179
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:35,474
Rym: it immediately skips to the next plot point burning wheel style and every time you think well why don't the characters just do act?

180
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:36,962
Rym: yeah they do pretty much immediately.

181
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:41,803
Rym: they're smarter than you or at least as smart as you and I really like this show.

182
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:44,982
Rym: I think it's the best anime I'm watching currently or know about.

183
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:47,614
Rym: that is on recently that I haven't seen yet man.

184
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:51,854
Rym: so I'll probably finish it soon and whenever Scott watches it will do a kind of full review.

185
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:56,836
Scott: but it's super good on your porn if you need any anime to watch right now.

186
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,001
Rym: watch since that guy you're.

187
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,270
Rym: it's all on crunchyroll alright.

188
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,702
Scott: so we've been talking about this for a thousand years.

189
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,847
Scott: the Monaco is out today.

190
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:18,931
Scott: yes I've been playing it for about a two keys already one in the newsletter that you subscribe to and one on Google Plus on our Google Plus page which you should you know look at.

191
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:23,868
Scott: so you know hey benefits for following us in all the places.

192
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,677
Scott: yep Monaco is the best.

193
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:28,464
Rym: Monaco is pretty fun.

194
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:35,589
Scott: if you play video games and you have a computer you should be playing this video game seriously.

195
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:41,490
Scott: how often do we say this video game is the game to play doesn't even begin with N?

196
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:52,289
Rym: the way I would sell it to you is it's a stealth cooperative competitive game but unlike most stealth games like mark of the ninja where oh I got seen start over.

197
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:52,811
Rym: fuck this.

198
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,340
Rym: when you get seen it's oh shit.

199
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,837
Rym: and that's when you start bombing everything and running away.

200
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,079
Rym: and it's.

201
00:13:58,401 --> 00:13:59,607
Rym: it's just like a heist movie.

202
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:00,573
Scott: it's a party game.

203
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:01,317
Rym: it's a party game.

204
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:05,276
Scott: heist movie with it might be it might be the ultimate party game.

205
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,327
Scott: that's actually not just something like Tetris.

206
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:14,686
Rym: well the ultimate party game is still a wario where on the game I'm just saying this is there's no better might be like the skill based party game.

207
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,317
Scott: it's pretty great just never really existed before.

208
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:18,504
Rym: I'm digging it.

209
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:20,060
Rym: and our review of early be on Tuesday.

210
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,682
Scott: yep yep all right all right.

211
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,228
Rym: so things of the day.

212
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:39,593
Rym: if you guys haven't noticed I'm a pretty big fan of adventure time and had the same progression that ponies had that.

213
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:46,608
Rym: a lot of things I've seen recently had even venture brothers where I watch the first like couple episodes of something I'm like oh this is okay.

214
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:47,332
Rym: I know why.

215
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,805
Rym: I understand why people like it now but I'm not that into it.

216
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:58,323
Rym: and then a few more episodes later just one of my favorite things ever adventure time pretty much followed that exact same progression.

217
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:04,986
Rym: I watch every episode like the day it comes out on some ultra like bootleg cam cap bullshit.

218
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:06,270
Rym: okay it's great.

219
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:09,339
Rym: my thing of the day is just a pretty good.

220
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:10,864
Rym: what time is it?

221
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:13,512
Rym: musical mashup from adventure time.

222
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:22,946
Rym: that reminds me very much of this cool guy who did similar mashups of for example the old Alice in Wonderland cartoon pogo.

223
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:26,950
Scott: yeah yeah the guy who can't come in the US because he fucked up his visa pogo is pretty cool.

224
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:34,549
Rym: this is reminiscent of his style and it's also if you haven't seen adventure time it gives you a nice sampling of what the deal is with adventure time.

225
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,251
Scott: alright.

226
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,280
Scott: so my thing of the day.

227
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:43,143
Scott: this guy works at Publix which is a pretty good grocery store not as good as Wegmans but it's down in Florida.

228
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,918
Scott: Publix has a secret if you've never been to one.

229
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:55,947
Scott: if you live down south where they have these stores you can actually go to the deli counter where they have the meats and the cheeses and get peanut butter that they make in the store from peanuts.

230
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,615
Scott: fresh is the best peanut butter.

231
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:00,067
Rym: like the grocery store right here has that too.

232
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,622
Rym: which grocery store the food cellar like right there?

233
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:03,829
Scott: that's a fancy grocery store.

234
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:05,881
Scott: yeah this would be like if stop and shop had that shit.

235
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:11,565
Scott: this is like you know if you went to you know fine fair and they had some Trader Joe's shit up.

236
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:12,690
Scott: it's like whoa.

237
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,555
Scott: what is this doing here?

238
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,308
Scott: cuz Publix is like a normal grocery store.

239
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:19,416
Scott: it's like a stop and shop but it's like they got some pretty good stuff there that you wouldn't expect to be you know.

240
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,687
Scott: so anyway this guy works in a Publix.

241
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:29,348
Scott: he looks like maybe a high school kid or whatever I can't even tell and he's cutting up a watermelon cuz you know what they do is they have an ugly watermelon.

242
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:30,675
Scott: it's not gonna sell you know.

243
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,818
Scott: so they cut it up and they will sell slices in a plastic package or they'll sell.

244
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:38,277
Scott: they'll put up a bunch of chunks into like a little plastic cup and sell that.

245
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:39,503
Scott: you know grocery stores do.

246
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,192
Scott: she's cutting up a watermelon.

247
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,408
Scott: this dude can cut the whole watermelon in 30 seconds or less.

248
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:45,232
Scott: it is crazy.

249
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:46,659
Scott: his watermelon cutting skills.

250
00:16:47,283 --> 00:16:49,553
Scott: you got to invite him to your you know 4th of July party.

251
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:58,889
Rym: it goes to show if your job if you have a job that makes you do one thing that's boring and mechanical repeatedly you will get good at it.

252
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,370
Scott: I always have a lot of respect for people with those menial jobs where they get.

253
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,109
Scott: you know incredible dexterity and you know reflex skills got to this day.

254
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,367
Rym: you should see me or Alex make a fucking submarine sandwich after working.

255
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,523
Scott: right but it's like see how many videos are things of the day.

256
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:20,413
Scott: we're like guy really good at ironing or guy really good at making pancake or guy really good at doing his little ice cream trick where he gives you ice cream and then takes it back.

257
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:32,168
Scott: you know all that kind of stuff I kind of actually you know think one day maybe I'm an old man or when computers program themselves I'll get a job like that and master some meaningless skill for awesomeness.

258
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:33,453
Scott: you know I kind of want to do that.

259
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:34,316
Rym: book club.

260
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:38,372
Rym: book is player of games by you know banks.

261
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:39,537
Rym: we'll do it soon.

262
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,603
Rym: it's biking seasons.

263
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:41,447
Scott: only next month.

264
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:46,412
Rym: I don't read as much as I do in normally in biking season because I primarily read on the subway.

265
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,183
Rym: we got internet stuff.

266
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:50,248
Rym: we're gonna be an anime Boston.

267
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,493
Rym: we're gonna be at PAX Australia.

268
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:52,376
Rym: we're gonna be a pecs prime.

269
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,220
Rym: we might be a PAX dev.

270
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:56,934
Rym: yeah we're gonna be at all those things.

271
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:58,480
Rym: it's gonna be awesome.

272
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:00,166
Rym: check out our youtubes.

273
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:06,004
Rym: and rave master was a pretty shitty show I don't know.

274
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:08,132
Rym: I know you watch way more of it than I did.

275
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:11,769
Scott: I watch like five six seven episodes something like that.

276
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:12,937
Scott: I thought it was long ago.

277
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:13,360
Scott: I don't remember.

278
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:18,728
Rym: we were trying to think about a show vaguely around the idea of anime we won't watch or didn't watch.

279
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:21,766
Scott: but I started watching and didn't finish watch because I thought way back.

280
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,475
Rym: someone put together a pretty good list.

281
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:33,259
Rym: it was like the hundred best anime of all time and I remember looking at the list realizing I had watched like 97 of them most and I knew what the other three were.

282
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:41,977
Scott: I knew I knew what every single thing on the list was and I had seen the overwhelming plurality of them and I realized I've seen a lot of goddamn anime.

283
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:56,480
Rym: but yet there is a large list of anime that I have specifically despite knowing it exists chosen not to watch it and I'm talking about stuff that I barely know exists like I don't know crappy new moe show that is obviously just incest.

284
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,120
Scott: yeah like I know there's a show called Canon but do I really need to tell you why I haven't watched it?

285
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:06,543
Rym: yeah I watched one episode of that Tokimeki anime and it was awful.

286
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,908
Scott: there's the Tokimeki anime.

287
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:11,892
Rym: I got it because the kill the guy who did those Sailor Moon subs and the end of Eva subs.

288
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:15,144
Rym: back in the day that I got he also randomly subbed that.

289
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:21,919
Scott: yeah let's start by talking about anime that we started watching but didn't finish and then we'll move on from there rave master.

290
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,592
Scott: so rave master I watched five six episodes.

291
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:33,477
Rym: I watched two episodes and I remember thinking it was just dumb and I actually stopped watching current anime after that because that was the popular show everyone was watching.

292
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:35,973
Rym: I was you know it wasn't that popular in the anime club at the time.

293
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:37,562
Rym: it was yeah was?

294
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:40,664
Rym: we showed in the anime club but then people were all talking about it and watching it like.

295
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:45,950
Rym: I don't remember that was the show all the normal people in the club would talk about before club for like.

296
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,539
Scott: well I don't remember that.

297
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:50,213
Scott: I watched just a few episodes because it was the new show.

298
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:52,082
Scott: it had bright colors the.

299
00:19:52,222 --> 00:20:00,411
Scott: it was a basically an adventure show where the guy had a big sword and a pet and the pet was really cute and there was some sort of mysterious fantasy adventure that I want to know the secret of.

300
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:08,200
Scott: but what ended up happening was after five six episodes I realized wait a minute and I rewinded and I looked.

301
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,455
Scott: they spent like four or five episodes in a row like a whole bunch of them.

302
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,203
Scott: they were in one room.

303
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:17,359
Scott: all the characters are in that room not leaving the room.

304
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:29,352
Scott: it was like some throne room or something or something right and just this one battle that was even slower than Naruto battle and I was like wow nothing has happened in these past few episodes.

305
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:32,023
Scott: it is still the same battle not watching anymore.

306
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:36,220
Scott: yep the same thing happened to me with Naruto.

307
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:37,103
Rym: oh my god we've.

308
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:39,111
Rym: I remember Naruto like the people who are.

309
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:43,975
Rym: why cuz you know we were running the anime club so we didn't have as much time to watch anime.

310
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:49,942
Rym: a few of the harder core people in the club watched Naruto before us and we're raving about.

311
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:53,963
Scott: everyone is raving about Naruto and it was this was Naruto was brand new the newest.

312
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:56,114
Rym: so we were like all right it's funny ninja school.

313
00:20:56,174 --> 00:20:57,320
Rym: let's show it to the club.

314
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:00,317
Scott: I had never I had never seen it and but everyone was talking it up.

315
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:01,605
Scott: so I said I'll get to it someday.

316
00:21:01,646 --> 00:21:09,284
Scott: so we showed it at clubs and I watched those four episodes and I said that is hysterical that ninja school with the sexy nojitsu this is.

317
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:10,549
Scott: everyone was totally right.

318
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,212
Scott: the show is awesome.

319
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:12,859
Rym: that show was awesome.

320
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,295
Scott: and then I recall so I went home and I kept watching Naruto.

321
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,225
Scott: yeah but I recall it was so awesome.

322
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,294
Rym: where actually two moments ruin the show from.

323
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:22,062
Scott: I got episode 13.

324
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:32,619
Rym: the moment that ruined it for me was there was this whole build-up in this big fight that I didn't notice yet was just a Dragon Ball fight and sudden fine the whole thing was how did Naruto do that like how did he win?

325
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:33,223
Rym: I don't know.

326
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:37,065
Rym: everyone's trying to figure out how he won and then it was just some proper noun bullshit.

327
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,278
Rym: he just used a special technique and I was like wait a minute.

328
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:40,163
Rym: how long did that fight?

329
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:41,270
Rym: wait a minute.

330
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,636
Rym: this is Dragon Ball.

331
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:58,530
Scott: I got to episode 13. they were basically in this fight against like magic crystal mirror girl and big sword guy and it was you know Naruto and the girl and Sasuke I remember the girl's name anymore right and they're fighting against magic mirror crystal girl and big sword guy.

332
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,419
Scott: it's like the first big fight of the show.

333
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:10,288
Scott: and first of all I'm already upset because funny ninja school is gone right yep and the best character the teacher guy is not there and I'm like what the fuck where is the awesome teacher?

334
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:11,474
Scott: I want him in every episode.

335
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:18,654
Scott: he should be the main character and that fight finally ends like episode 13 and I said wait a minute rave master.

336
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:24,134
Scott: this fight has been going on since like episode 7 now watching any more Naruto's.

337
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:29,998
Rym: I don't think we need to belabor the point on fighting shows but suffice it to say there's a problem.

338
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:40,380
Rym: we had in those days where we were mostly watching really old anime from the library and the current popular show and every time it was a shonen fighting show.

339
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,054
Rym: the first couple episodes of those shows are usually awesome because they usually have really cool iconic characters.

340
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:49,369
Scott: yeah bleach yeah bleach bleach is the worst of them all.

341
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,904
Scott: cuz after episode one I knew and I was done with it.

342
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:54,149
Scott: yeah I was like episode one.

343
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:57,005
Scott: all right this is a little bit like Yu Yu Hakusho kind of.

344
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:58,291
Rym: yeah Yu Yu Hakusho episode.

345
00:22:58,392 --> 00:22:58,954
Rym: one same thing.

346
00:22:58,994 --> 00:22:59,857
Rym: I thought it was great.

347
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:00,900
Scott: then episode two.

348
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:06,600
Scott: wait a minute I'm catching on now you're not fooling me till episode 13 again.

349
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:13,310
Rym: so I think the worst of all of those it's because it's so bad it warrants a special mention.

350
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:20,989
Rym: because this show we I watched four episodes of yeah partly because we showed it in club and I was the one who had to stick around to lock the door.

351
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,655
Rym: Final Fantasy unlimited.

352
00:23:25,357 --> 00:23:26,800
Scott: I did not watch that.

353
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,208
Rym: that might be the worst show.

354
00:23:30,228 --> 00:23:37,414
Rym: I say show because there's special things like gray the digital target that I had ever seen up to that scene.

355
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:49,216
Rym: okay it was unbearable and had nothing to do with Final Fantasy except it happened to have a chocobo and this is before a lot of the final thing wasn't there.

356
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:51,024
Scott: that other Final Fantasy anime?

357
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:54,861
Scott: yes it is older it is worse worse Christiana whatever?

358
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,472
Rym: yeah yeah that's worse and I chose not to watch it.

359
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:57,895
Scott: never see.

360
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:01,299
Scott: I remember that tape was always in the library and that would be one of the tape was always in blows.

361
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,231
Scott: one of the tape see but always point you and go.

362
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:05,601
Rym: wow the worst that was a show.

363
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:06,766
Scott: I didn't watch that either.

364
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:14,600
Rym: I'd go I'd look at blockbuster and I'd see that and I'd see like Armageddon and I'd be like I'm gonna watch Armageddon anyway.

365
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:18,034
Scott: so another just to finish off the fighting show list.

366
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:18,819
Scott: right one piece.

367
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,064
Scott: I will actually watch the one piece anime for episodes and I liked all of them and I wanted to keep watching.

368
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:31,038
Scott: but I switched over to the manga and I got to fighting the swordfish man and that lasted multiple volumes of manga.

369
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,945
Scott: so I stopped buying new volumes.

370
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:41,411
Scott: but then it the final volume showed up because I pre-ordered and that volume they beat the fish man and the plot moved crazy fast and I was like oh my god this is why one piece is awesome.

371
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:42,818
Scott: why can't every volume be like this?

372
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:46,917
Scott: but then I still held fast and did not order any more volumes.

373
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:48,265
Rym: yep these are just showing.

374
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:49,090
Scott: that is a good thing.

375
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,867
Scott: otherwise I would need the whole bookshelf just through the one piece.

376
00:24:51,967 --> 00:25:01,338
Rym: I don't know if I will ever be at a point in my life where I can deal with the shonen fighting formula of fights go on forever and the show also goes on forever no matter how good the character.

377
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:04,975
Scott: watched all of Hokuto no Ken and now I feel as if I'm done.

378
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:11,101
Scott: I feel like and if I need that again I'll watch Hokuto no Ken again for whatever reason.

379
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:20,114
Rym: well like we've talked about this before Hokuto no Ken despite having many of the same issues feel because it invented the issue exactly.

380
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:23,589
Rym: but it also feels faster like if I watched ten episodes.

381
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:27,008
Scott: yeah because when he punches someone in the head they die immediately.

382
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:30,750
Scott: none of this ten episode per fight it's just a different fight every fucking episode.

383
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,298
Rym: there might be several episodes of.

384
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,067
Rym: I'm going to do this thing.

385
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:44,317
Scott: even the climactic fights like against row and shit are like two episodes the same as the initial D. a race doesn't last more than two episodes in initial D but one piece I just couldn't deal with.

386
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:46,466
Rym: yeah I think it might have be the one.

387
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:56,463
Rym: how long the show is like initial D. even when I was watching it I recognized the formula that was going on but I knew it was 26 episodes.

388
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,185
Scott: but it's not.

389
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:08,356
Rym: it was at the time one piece I knew from the beginning was gonna be even longer than freakin anything all right.

390
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:11,110
Scott: so other anime started watching did not finish.

391
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:15,552
Rym: interesting though I watched all of Sailor Moon that's 200 episodes so whatever.

392
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:18,566
Rym: so let's get into something different not a fighting show.

393
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:21,038
Rym: ergo proxy was the show that I liked.

394
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,586
Scott: I kind of liked it was good.

395
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:23,289
Scott: it wasn't the best.

396
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:29,948
Scott: it was a show that when I was wondering what the terrible secret of space was started out kind of boring and then really quickly got really good.

397
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:34,377
Scott: I actually thought the first episode is more exciting because all the cool sci-fi stuff in the city.

398
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:46,700
Rym: I thought the first episode was less exciting because it seemed so like it was trying so hard to be dark and gritty and it wasn't the best cool sci-fi city cyberpunk.

399
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,423
Scott: but it was okay.

400
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:49,070
Scott: but basically outside the city.

401
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,655
Scott: it was like oh I don't care about these people outside the city I just want to see you try to get back in.

402
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:53,759
Rym: well the show.

403
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,080
Rym: I was like.

404
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,642
Rym: I liked it.

405
00:26:55,225 --> 00:27:00,735
Rym: and then just when I started to get bored they were like we're getting out of the city with the girl in the rabbit costume.

406
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:08,796
Rym: then I was like oh this is awesome and then it got boring again and it just started to pick up and then we were just busy and kind of stopped watching it.

407
00:27:08,816 --> 00:27:18,675
Rym: cuz I think we were Netflix net at the time and I didn't like it so much that I like fought to go back and see it again so that eventually we kind of like it was a show that we liked but we kind of forgot we were watching.

408
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,161
Rym: yeah because there was a gap.

409
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:24,707
Rym: like if there hadn't been that gap I think it was like we went to two conventions or something.

410
00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:25,452
Rym: we didn't have time.

411
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:30,701
Rym: we probably would have finished the show but as soon as we forgot we were watching it we've never stopped.

412
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:31,929
Rym: we never watched any more of it.

413
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:33,921
Scott: Kazu no Yojimbo is similar right.

414
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:37,017
Scott: it's like we watched a little bit of anime club back in the day or something I

415
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:38,382
Rym: tried to watch a

416
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:45,782
Scott: watching it for Netflix and it's like it wasn't the best show but it wasn't bad and I was kind of curious what the D of mystery was in the town.

417
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:48,921
Rym: yeah it also had really good moments like where the guy'd go out.

418
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:49,887
Rym: then there's the gunshot.

419
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:50,893
Rym: he's like who fired that.

420
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:51,738
Rym: what's going on?

421
00:27:51,758 --> 00:28:02,190
Scott: yep so it's just we just kept watching it sort of you know rolling with it just seeing what's up and then something interrupted them because it wasn't so good that we were desperate and wanted to seek again.

422
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:05,743
Scott: we wasn't good enough for us to put an effort to see more.

423
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:10,584
Scott: so any interruption in the habit of watching it basically ended watching it.

424
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:21,920
Rym: so years later when I was commuting every day on the train to Yonkers from Beacon I had a little DVD thing and I was like you know what I'm gonna start why I need some anime I can watch going to and from work on the train.

425
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:25,798
Rym: so I got I was like oh yeah Kazu no Yojimbo I remember kind of liking that.

426
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,833
Rym: so I started watching it and I got to about the point.

427
00:28:28,914 --> 00:28:34,477
Rym: Scott and I had watched it before and I suddenly realized it was a chore like.

428
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:35,019
Rym: I liked it.

429
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,682
Rym: okay but an episode would end and I'd be like well guess I should watch the next one like I got.

430
00:28:39,722 --> 00:28:45,470
Scott: if I gotta get it's not like that time when I put Evangelion on my phone and was like can't stop oh my god.

431
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:53,226
Rym: there was one time one of our friends was on my phone one of the FRC you know Scott and I moved back into our apartment at RIT mm-hmm like we're.

432
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:57,050
Rym: I forget if we move back in or if we just been there and then someone returned.

433
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,422
Rym: cuz I figure we hear the turn cowboy bebop on.

434
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:03,661
Rym: yeah we just like marathoning it to an unnamed member of the FRC.

435
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:06,755
Rym: we were like what you've never seen cowboy bebop what the fuck.

436
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:13,343
Rym: well here we'll show you a couple episodes and then whatever and then the three of us marathon the entire show.

437
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:15,552
Rym: at that moment I watched episode one.

438
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:17,862
Rym: I was like oh right the show is the best.

439
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,618
Rym: so I was watching cos the new yojimbo kind of forcing my way through it.

440
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:22,904
Rym: it was okay.

441
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:31,086
Rym: but then I watched one episode of eska flown and I was like oh my god that's what it feels like to really want to watch the next episode of a show.

442
00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:31,568
Rym: that's right.

443
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:38,356
Rym: and then I decided right then and there I will never again watch another episode of any show that I don't feel.

444
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:42,750
Rym: hmm as soon as I detect that it is they chore a slog.

445
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:52,845
Rym: perhaps I'm bailing and going home and I'm watching Ava or eska cowboy bebop Gundam seed yeah ghost in the shell all right.

446
00:29:53,427 --> 00:30:03,123
Scott: are there any other shows you started watching and did not well pleat watching we so Scott and Emily both had never really seen slayers a while ago.

447
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:05,996
Rym: so we started watching it bit by bit because I've seen most of slayers.

448
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:09,591
Rym: yeah this is before revolution or any of this stuff.

449
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:15,716
Rym: so we you know I got a dvds a bard and we started watching regular slayers again and super fun.

450
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:19,188
Rym: and we watch next and we just haven't started.

451
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,273
Rym: try yet.

452
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:21,743
Scott: well that's not sweet haven't started it.

453
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:23,536
Scott: so it doesn't really fit the start of it.

454
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:24,241
Rym: you've never seen it.

455
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:25,288
Rym: you could watch it at any time.

456
00:30:25,328 --> 00:30:26,613
Rym: it's sitting right there I will.

457
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:28,199
Scott: I want to.

458
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,182
Scott: yeah it's good.

459
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:32,295
Scott: I did watch the first episode of slayers revolution.

460
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:33,160
Scott: that doesn't really go.

461
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:33,965
Scott: there's a lot of.

462
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:36,946
Scott: have the animes that I've watched one episode of but I don't think those count.

463
00:30:36,986 --> 00:30:38,012
Scott: I think it's more animes.

464
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:40,081
Scott: you watched a few episodes of right for example.

465
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:47,516
Rym: I think the killer is the show that you watch most of and that like if you got more than halfway through and then you stop.

466
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:49,405
Scott: yeah so check this out right over the winner.

467
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:50,992
Scott: I got my bike in place thing.

468
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:56,519
Scott: I was watching space runaway eating on while biking in place right I remember that shows name.

469
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:08,243
Scott: originally I had watched like five episodes and stopped and then I got this time while biking in place in my apartment I watched seventy to eighty percent of that show before stopping.

470
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:12,316
Scott: wow and it's not that it really changed.

471
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:14,604
Scott: it got bad or was a slog.

472
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,611
Scott: it was you know it was just sort of.

473
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:21,007
Scott: so nothing in is a terrible secret I want to learn to.

474
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:29,607
Scott: but the thing is most of the episodes it's pretty much every episode has a space battle no matter what right even though it's a different space battle each episode.

475
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:32,487
Scott: so it's sort of like I really just want to fast forward through that battle.

476
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,211
Scott: see who wins it.

477
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:42,409
Scott: it's just like okay you're flying around and shooting each other in spaceships again and the robot okay and yep and that takes up a lot of time.

478
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,702
Scott: some of the episodes it'll take up like half the episode.

479
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:47,336
Rym: you know Wolf's Rain which is people have talking about again.

480
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:47,920
Scott: another one.

481
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,575
Rym: I started I got more than halfway through it.

482
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:53,209
Rym: I got ten episodes maybe and then I got bored with it.

483
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,014
Rym: I never saw the end.

484
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:57,836
Scott: I got it when I got it when the party was together and running through the snowy place.

485
00:31:58,118 --> 00:31:59,384
Rym: yep but there's a part.

486
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:04,004
Rym: I literally I was just like I didn't care anymore like I couldn't see where the show was going.

487
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:12,080
Rym: yep but I got more than halfway through at least with a speedgrapher four episodes in I was like fuck this yeah as soon as he got weird.

488
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,807
Rym: no I like weird.

489
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,975
Rym: it just it was weird that I didn't care about.

490
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:24,767
Rym: yep I mean and it was slow but not in a good way like gassaraki is slow but I like that kind of slow.

491
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:28,205
Rym: yep I like that kind of slow a lot way more than a lot of other people do.

492
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:33,044
Scott: but you don't like the galaxy train kind of slow night on the galactic railroad.

493
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,977
Rym: yeah no I don't enjoy that movie don't enjoy it at all.

494
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:41,111
Rym: but slow space other kinds of shows that do like.

495
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:45,925
Rym: yeah but speedgrapher was just like.

496
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:56,707
Rym: it's the kind of show where I if I can't project any good direction like any angle for the show like Ava watching it I projected immediately there's all these angles that could have like.

497
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:00,348
Rym: maybe it's gonna be about gods maybe it's gonna be about transhumanism.

498
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:09,086
Rym: but I can project or predict angles that are gonna be awesome but like Wolf's reign I couldn't come up with any possible way for it to have a satisfying ending.

499
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:11,761
Rym: hmm and the same thing with speedgrapher.

500
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:18,875
Rym: I was like there is nothing the show could be about that would actually satisfy me at the end and explain this bullshit that I just watched.

501
00:33:19,056 --> 00:33:23,359
Scott: right I got two other shows that I can think of on the top of my head that fit this category.

502
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:26,073
Scott: all right one is the or on high school host club.

503
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:27,861
Rym: I really like that show.

504
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:31,477
Scott: actually watch like four episodes and it was funny and it was good.

505
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:36,802
Scott: but by the fourth episode it was sort of like it's the same joke all this sort of same.

506
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:39,033
Scott: you know jokes that you had in the other episode.

507
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:42,731
Scott: you know these sort of gendery jokes and things like that and you know what.

508
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:49,736
Scott: I've heard those jokes before and I don't really feel a strong desire to see the next episode because I'm not laughing at these jokes that hard.

509
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:58,603
Scott: so I actually did want to keep watching.

510
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:02,038
Rym: I watched two episodes of that and I marathon the whole thing with Emily.

511
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:05,133
Scott: I want to know the terrible secret but I did terrible see.

512
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,404
Rym: that show is great.

513
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:08,830
Scott: I know most of the terrible secrets.

514
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:10,496
Scott: actually at least I'm pretty close.

515
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:17,188
Rym: yeah I know you don't and then I'll put it this way who do you think is the terrible secret like?

516
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,193
Rym: what do you think it revolves around?

517
00:34:18,214 --> 00:34:18,676
Scott: well is it?

518
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:21,089
Scott: isn't the idea that Hari is looking for aliens?

519
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:22,375
Scott: she believes all this crazy shit.

520
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,123
Scott: yeah and so.

521
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:31,920
Scott: and then she's with all these people think she's crazy but they're all in the same club but actually all of them are the aliens all the time except maybe the guy.

522
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:34,609
Scott: okay and then I don't know.

523
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,525
Rym: okay there is a significant something about time travel.

524
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:39,911
Scott: that's why the episodes are all mixed up.

525
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,688
Rym: you have not even conceived of what the show is actually about.

526
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:44,889
Rym: yet.

527
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:46,996
Rym: okay show is gonna do a thing.

528
00:34:47,016 --> 00:34:51,958
Scott: you're gonna be like oh all right all right at a point anyway but yeah that's you know.

529
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,324
Scott: sometimes that just happens.

530
00:34:53,906 --> 00:35:07,520
Rym: so there's some shows that are big popular well-known or at least in their time we're super well-known that despite being the biggest goddamn anime fans not only did we never watch them or at least I never watched them.

531
00:35:07,902 --> 00:35:19,653
Rym: but in that era in the 2000s if I was an anime con and I was like I've never seen the - Co people be like what the fuck Rym what the fuck actually I did watch a few episodes in - Co and not finish.

532
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:20,917
Rym: I didn't watch any.

533
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:23,566
Rym: I I never cared about a - Co.

534
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:36,520
Rym: everyone who ever tried to tell me to watch it told me it was about something different never told me it was about something good and the fact that it is basically completely forgotten except by people

535
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,343
Scott: who were big

536
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:40,476
Rym: into anime and watched it in the two in the 2000s.

537
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:43,529
Rym: I think I made the right choice and never watching it.

538
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,519
Scott: yeah I didn't finish it and I'm good.

539
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:48,132
Rym: yeah but sir I don't think you guys can understand.

540
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:50,464
Rym: that was people would say in the - Co.

541
00:35:50,484 --> 00:36:01,520
Scott: it was a pretty big show at the list of the five or ten shows that they assume everyone in the club has seen all of and when the anime club had like giveaways there would be like a - Co wall scroll and people knew what it was.

542
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,551
Rym: it was like right next to the Ava wall scroll.

543
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:04,937
Rym: that's right that level.

544
00:36:05,118 --> 00:36:06,966
Rym: yep and completely forgotten.

545
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,555
Rym: Ava people still argue about it.

546
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:11,437
Scott: well I don't even remember the last time I heard someone mentioned a - Co before.

547
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:16,186
Rym: right now yeah it came up recently because someone one of our friends was like you've still not seen the - Co.

548
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:19,926
Rym: which is why I was thinking about this and I was like I don't actually ever plan to.

549
00:36:19,946 --> 00:36:21,877
Rym: yeah no one has ever told me it was good.

550
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:23,527
Scott: don't we have the full set right here?

551
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:24,673
Rym: yes I bought the box set.

552
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:26,078
Rym: it was like five dollars.

553
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,126
Rym: I've never even opened it.

554
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:35,651
Rym: yeah there was another show that was stupidly popular among a good chunk of the anime club.

555
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:39,349
Scott: I remember Weiss Cruz White Cross mmm that's what I was a cute boys show.

556
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,176
Rym: I think I don't know what it's about.

557
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,424
Scott: I never learned it.

558
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:43,645
Scott: st.

559
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:45,754
Scott: say huh or am I just way off?

560
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:49,454
Rym: I think it's about flowers people who run a flower shop but are also terrorists.

561
00:36:49,695 --> 00:36:51,504
Scott: isn't that gravitation which I also didn't see?

562
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:53,091
Rym: I watched some of it.

563
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,924
Rym: I have beef with gravitation but not in this sense.

564
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:59,117
Scott: I think I connect them because they're both cute boys shows.

565
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:00,302
Rym: right White Cross?

566
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:13,893
Rym: the reason I did not watch it was that a ton of people I remember we're going crazy about this show and then I learned that most of them had not ever actually seen a single episode of it.

567
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:23,803
Rym: really so when I learned that I decided that show is probably stupid and in retrospect I was 100%.

568
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:26,210
Scott: another show no one talks about anymore.

569
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:31,685
Rym: that show is forgotten mm-hmm I remember.

570
00:37:31,765 --> 00:37:34,112
Rym: so the tenchi or what gal gaga?

571
00:37:34,132 --> 00:37:34,836
Rym: I've never watched.

572
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:35,721
Rym: I have no plans to.

573
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:36,506
Scott: I don't watch that.

574
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:47,105
Scott: simply I think I actually might like gal gaga but everyone says well it doesn't get good until this late episode and it's way too many episodes to sit through that are bad unlike say hoke don't know can which is good every episode.

575
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:50,282
Rym: thus gal gaga for me is in that same category.

576
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:52,716
Rym: that not worth the effort of the galactic heroes is.

577
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,532
Rym: is that it is worth the effort when I don't have anything else to do?

578
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:58,102
Scott: when I'm an old man and we're tired I'll watch gaga shows like that.

579
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,271
Rym: I'm gonna watch when I'm 90 in a retirement home and all my friends are dead.

580
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:07,042
Scott: yep well I'll be the one alive when I'll be the one alive.

581
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:12,360
Scott: okay on this I will watch gaga gaga and be like this.

582
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,536
Scott: one's for you Rym but and I'll pour out some digital bits.

583
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:20,692
Rym: so there was a whole special class of shows that I stopped watching.

584
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:27,457
Rym: that were basically the shitty TV knockoff of what was a good Oh AV reader die TV.

585
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:31,251
Rym: so actually that's the one I watched all the way through that for last.

586
00:38:31,272 --> 00:38:34,260
Rym: so El Hazzard is a great show.

587
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:41,484
Rym: the Wanderers is just a slow-paced poorly done shitty watered-down TV show.

588
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:44,356
Scott: redo yep I knew better and didn't even try to watch the Wanderers.

589
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:45,522
Rym: I was like five episodes.

590
00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:46,105
Rym: I was like what?

591
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:51,473
Rym: the same with lotus war lotus war oh yeah same thing tenchi muyo.

592
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:55,728
Rym: same thing the original av love or hate that kind of harem show.

593
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:57,676
Rym: it was an important show in its time.

594
00:38:57,696 --> 00:38:59,684
Rym: I enjoyed that show a lot.

595
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:07,153
Rym: the TV series is is is is that came afterward where each and every one of them increasingly mediocre?

596
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:15,183
Rym: you can tell how mediocre attention episode of anything is by how much later it came out after the first OAV ended.

597
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:17,172
Scott: that reminds me of similar things.

598
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:25,936
Scott: for example I watched all of the first season of full metal panic but did not watch any other full metal panics because I sort of regretted finishing watching the first one.

599
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:28,189
Rym: I didn't finish the first one because I knew better.

600
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,636
Rym: I watched that show and I was like all right.

601
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:38,492
Rym: it's got an average to like be level robot plot and a mildly funny school plot and they mash them up and the.

602
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:41,950
Rym: the good part of the show is that they mashed them up and that's like.

603
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,714
Rym: that's the cool part.

604
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:50,569
Rym: then they'd film a food where they just took it's like they took the worst most pedestrian jokes and made the entire show that right.

605
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:56,501
Scott: so similarly I watched all of the Full Metal Alchemist TV series as did I as it came out own all the manga.

606
00:39:56,581 --> 00:40:04,016
Scott: even though I haven't read all of it yet I do plan to have not seen a single second of Brotherhood or any movie I remember.

607
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:07,268
Rym: I was excited that the movie was coming and then it came out.

608
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:11,002
Scott: I didn't watch a second of it not in one and by that point it's funny.

609
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:14,758
Rym: I we were super invested in Full Metal Alchemist.

610
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:18,918
Scott: that like we would all get together to watch a new episode the day it came out.

611
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:20,203
Rym: that was the big show.

612
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:22,111
Rym: I was huge like we went to.

613
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:29,720
Rym: I remember we were at Otakon and Lark OCL did their crazy concert partly because Full Metal Alchemist and they had.

614
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,805
Rym: they did one of the openers.

615
00:40:30,825 --> 00:40:31,508
Rym: yeah.

616
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:41,057
Rym: so we were there and they showed like the first episode of the show and while we were waiting for the concert to start and even a bunch of her friends were like whoa that's what this show is about.

617
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:41,860
Rym: oh my god.

618
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,917
Rym: and it was the biggest and I thought that show was the best.

619
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:46,760
Rym: it was pretty good.

620
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:53,373
Rym: within a week of it ending I forgot about it didn't care anymore never remembered it have no plans never watch it again.

621
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:58,094
Rym: it was one of those shows that was good in its era and everyone watched it and the no one will remember it.

622
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:06,300
Rym: mm-hmm uh but yeah in the knockoff genre I did actually watch all of read or die TV.

623
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,334
Rym: let me tell you there is no payoff.

624
00:41:10,354 --> 00:41:11,582
Rym: that could have been possible.

625
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:12,650
Rym: that would have made that worthwhile.

626
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:15,059
Rym: there was in fact no payoff.

627
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:16,726
Scott: I watched all of love Hina.

628
00:41:16,826 --> 00:41:17,609
Scott: why did I do this?

629
00:41:18,151 --> 00:41:23,915
Scott: because the summer after freshman year at RIT I spent that summer doing being camp counselor.

630
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:25,726
Scott: but then that didn't take the whole summer.

631
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:28,401
Scott: that only takes eight weeks maybe nine weeks because of the training week.

632
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:30,914
Scott: right then I had the rest of the summer to do nothing.

633
00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:32,741
Scott: internet was a vt16 modem and mm-hmm.

634
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:35,834
Rym: wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute.

635
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:45,636
Scott: so the only anime that I had available to me the only thing I had to do was I had all of love Hina which I downloaded at RIT on this hard drive.

636
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:46,684
Rym: let me tell you a little story.

637
00:41:46,724 --> 00:41:51,749
Rym: so I'm living in the mountains with no internet working at IBM no friends within hundreds of miles of me.

638
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,926
Rym: yeah just kind of you know being bored and I'm a hard drive.

639
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:58,684
Rym: I happen to have all of gunslinger girls and all of read or die TV.

640
00:41:58,704 --> 00:41:59,970
Rym: so guess what I watched all of.

641
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:06,217
Scott: ah yeah someone who's trapped with nothing no way to get more things is gonna watch something crappy.

642
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:07,664
Rym: fuck both of those shows.

643
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:09,252
Scott: fuck all three of those shows.

644
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:09,714
Scott: love Hina.

645
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,924
Scott: also love Hina has cute turtles and that's it.

646
00:42:12,547 --> 00:42:22,567
Rym: but I remember like when when they announced tenchi in Tokyo I was actually excited because I wanted to see the kind of mainline plot of tenchi go forward.

647
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:24,234
Rym: it looked like it was gonna be cool.

648
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:28,454
Rym: I watched the first episode and I never watched any more tenchi after that.

649
00:42:28,494 --> 00:42:29,822
Rym: I haven't seen any tenji since then.

650
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,972
Scott: one episode of tenji gxp.

651
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:35,521
Rym: uh try to forget that fact.

652
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:44,875
Rym: that was that is still the worst disparity in all of history between the goodness of the opening theme song to an anime and the reality of what that anime is.

653
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,557
Rym: mm-hmm.

654
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,122
Rym: I don't know who gxp was for.

655
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,941
Rym: nobody like not even tenji fans because the characters aren't even in it.

656
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:55,258
Scott: let's wrap this up by talking about anime.

657
00:42:55,298 --> 00:42:57,249
Scott: we know exists but we know not to watch.

658
00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:59,741
Scott: so we haven't watched for example every incest show.

659
00:42:59,882 --> 00:43:02,114
Scott: well yes but I'm talking about less obvious ones.

660
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:03,502
Scott: for example you mentioned tenchi.

661
00:43:03,643 --> 00:43:05,895
Scott: you always used to go to media play and what was on the shelf?

662
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,032
Scott: Oh Oh photon that's right and you know what time.

663
00:43:10,112 --> 00:43:11,880
Scott: never bought it never watched it.

664
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,708
Scott: just ignore it was there.

665
00:43:13,748 --> 00:43:14,954
Scott: I kept seeing it over and over again.

666
00:43:14,974 --> 00:43:25,742
Rym: I've seen the same poorly dubbed with weird music trailer for it in front of other anime on DVDs like a hundred times every time like oh right that show that I'll never watch exists.

667
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,972
Rym: mm-hmm as far as I can tell it's about.

668
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:31,428
Rym: I don't know it is a tenchi knockoff and the guys an idiot.

669
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:34,702
Scott: I don't know what it is but I know it exists.

670
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:35,947
Scott: and there's an anime called photon.

671
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:39,705
Rym: anyone give us a good reason to watch one second of that show right?

672
00:43:40,288 --> 00:43:41,554
Scott: any other ones in that category?

673
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,808
Scott: ah in that category something you know is bad.

674
00:43:44,848 --> 00:43:52,983
Rym: there's a lot of shows that other people probably haven't watched for similar reasons but it's I think usually those reasons boil down to.

675
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:55,214
Rym: they're just too young and don't remember or know.

676
00:43:55,255 --> 00:44:02,445
Rym: these shows exist because there's no longer a culture in an anime fan society of discovering old shows.

677
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:03,107
Rym: there's no more.

678
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:05,135
Rym: the old guy says hey watch golden boy.

679
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:07,446
Rym: so no one will ever watch golden boy.

680
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:10,239
Scott: actually haven't seen golden boy though it's good it's pretty funny.

681
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,324
Rym: yeah I like it.

682
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:13,393
Scott: I know enough to know is good.

683
00:44:13,494 --> 00:44:19,241
Rym: or like bakuretsu hunters like no one's gonna tell anyone to watch that I do not watch that it's actually pretty funny.

684
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:21,271
Rym: yeah it's free it's okay it's not.

685
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:26,212
Rym: you know what it's on the level of all those shows like that from that era.

686
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:32,516
Rym: they're throwaway shows that are moderately funny that were surprisingly popular in their element at the time.

687
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:36,587
Scott: what was that weird?

688
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:40,029
Scott: I'm never gonna remember it and I'm not gonna be able to describe it because I didn't wear it.

689
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:43,558
Scott: it came in a weird box.

690
00:44:43,618 --> 00:44:44,982
Scott: Nicole liked it.

691
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:46,668
Scott: the box is like black.

692
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:48,814
Scott: that has something to do with lesbians.

693
00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:54,352
Rym: oh oh that was the show about the lesbian space pirates.

694
00:44:54,413 --> 00:44:55,838
Rym: that was just really dumb.

695
00:44:55,878 --> 00:44:56,541
Scott: what's it called?

696
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:57,404
Rym: I don't remember.

697
00:44:57,424 --> 00:45:00,359
Rym: I'm gonna Google for lesbian space pirates.

698
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:03,135
Scott: you're gonna find the lesbian space pirates which is a comic book.

699
00:45:03,155 --> 00:45:04,021
Scott: that's actually really good.

700
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:11,889
Rym: I actually do really like that comic space pirate anime not bodacious space pirates.

701
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:12,571
Scott: that's the good one.

702
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:15,509
Scott: yeah and I don't know I don't know if that's actually the good.

703
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:17,341
Rym: people are gonna be mad at us because I hurt people.

704
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,871
Rym: a lot of people say this show is pretty good.

705
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:30,161
Rym: I remember debating with people about it but I just remember people told me it was cowboy bebop with an all-female cast and that is not what that show was mm-hmm.

706
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,346
Rym: and actually you know what.

707
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:35,163
Rym: there's a show that's really popular that like David Riley and Joel I really like it.

708
00:45:35,203 --> 00:45:39,766
Rym: but uh Black Lagoon I watched a bunch of episodes of and I just didn't like it.

709
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:42,302
Scott: I watched like three episodes and I was like what the fuck this bullshit.

710
00:45:42,463 --> 00:45:49,274
Rym: it just seemed really kind of why I don't understand why everyone likes that show like it is the word I would use to describe that show.

711
00:45:49,294 --> 00:45:50,680
Scott: yeah I just don't get it.

712
00:45:51,643 --> 00:45:59,399
Rym: but at least we know about these shows though it's kind of bad that I can't remember the name of the show we were just talking about.

713
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:01,007
Scott: yeah I can think I can think.

714
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:03,863
Scott: you know I just realized it's just coming into my head now.

715
00:46:03,984 --> 00:46:08,860
Scott: all these shows like get backers and you know there's just so many shows.

716
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,044
Scott: D gray man.

717
00:46:10,064 --> 00:46:14,877
Rym: but yeah well there was heat guy J guy J.

718
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,442
Scott: it's just so.

719
00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:22,490
Rym: the problem is the anime weren't really notable because there's shows that we watched like one episode of her like.

720
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,180
Rym: yeah this isn't any good and just didn't bother.

721
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:34,282
Rym: there's a difference between that and the show that you know exists could watch and choose to never watch or the show that you watch a lot of and then stop watching.

722
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:34,362
Rym: mmm.

723
00:46:35,707 --> 00:46:42,979
Rym: so yourself think about shows like that like try to list the shows you gave up on after having invested substantial time in them.

724
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,647
Rym: yeah you might see a pattern.

725
00:46:44,808 --> 00:46:47,320
Scott: I never watched any of those crest or star banners.

726
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:53,509
Rym: our crest of the stars was okay but I never watched banner of the star because crest was actually kind of too boring for me.

727
00:46:53,911 --> 00:47:03,567
Rym: hmm and that's coming from a man who thinks gassaraki is a great anime that everyone should see someone who did not fall asleep during sky crawlers.

728
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:07,059
Scott: all right have we gone on long enough?

729
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:07,603
Scott: I think we're good.

730
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:12,091
Rym: all right via this lot and so I wonder how many people stopped listening to this show before it finished.

731
00:47:12,312 --> 00:47:13,595
Scott: hopefully they're smart.

732
00:47:13,615 --> 00:47:14,377
Scott: most of them.

733
00:47:17,526 --> 00:47:19,753
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

734
00:47:19,814 --> 00:47:24,960
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
