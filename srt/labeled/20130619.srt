1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:16,300
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 19th, 2013, I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,139
Rym: Little Witch Academia.

3
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:21,198
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:30,570
Rym: So you might remember, we did a panel a while ago, and we've done this often, you know, Especially at anime conventions.

5
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,050
Rym: I realized we've done like, a hundred and fifty.

6
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:35,170
Rym: That's a lot.

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,270
Rym: That is a lot.

8
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:46,969
Rym: And that's even if I just count the ones we personally actually did, not any of the sort of like ghetto panels we did at like a Kinetic Con or anything when we were filling a room late at night.

9
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:50,009
Rym: That was like legit on the schedule, our names on it.

10
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:50,969
Rym: But I digress.

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:59,010
Rym: One we've often done is the how to run a panel panel, and we talk about things, and I realize there's a meta piece of advice above all of that.

12
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:08,470
Rym: A panel, show, lecture, or workshop at an anime convention is guaranteed to be bad if it has any of the following criteria.

13
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:10,850
Rym: One, it involves Hetalia.

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,270
Rym: Two, it involves asking the people anything that it's not guaranteed.

15
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,490
Scott: There could be the one good Hetalia panel that someone's doing.

16
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,545
Rym: There could be, I've never seen it.

17
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:20,329
Scott: Okay.

18
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:21,330
Rym: It's one of those things.

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,770
Rym: There could be a perfectly workable implementation of communism.

20
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:28,410
Scott: Yeah, in a very small place.

21
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:31,790
Scott: With like 10 people, we're all communist with each other.

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:40,530
Rym: There've been a couple of anime cons lately, and I'm not going to name any names, that denied some pretty good, serious, or interesting content.

23
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:58,150
Rym: But yeah, it had room in the schedule at good times for things like Hetalia Askination, AKA six girls in costume giggle about gay jokes for 45 minutes and then open it up to questions from the audience, or anime parliaments, or court cases, or things like that.

24
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:00,690
Scott: Do you allow those at ConnectiCon?

25
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:01,848
Rym: Yeah, we do.

26
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:02,450
Rym: We do.

27
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,089
Rym: No, I'll admit.

28
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,570
Scott: I've been fighting to have less of those at ConnectiCon.

29
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:16,467
Rym: I think we've cut them down to a substantial degree, and I tend to put a lot of them either at bad times or at times when I need to get the people who go to those things out of the hallways.

30
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:30,209
Rym: But really, if you're an anime con where you get a lot of good anime submissions, or at any anime submissions, specifically with the Askination panels, you're better off leaving the room empty than scheduling that shit.

31
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:35,509
Rym: If you want to raise the brow of your convention, that is how you do it.

32
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,810
Rym: Because making that stuff be an official part of the schedule in a panel room really encourages more of that kind of stuff to be submitted.

33
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:50,209
Rym: And it would be fine if it was actually cool, but it's just people giggling on stage for an hour.

34
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:51,005
Scott: Yep.

35
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:52,125
Scott: That's what it is.

36
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,570
Scott: But that's what the people coming to the con want.

37
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,190
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, it's a self-feedback loop.

38
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:12,485
Rym: Meanwhile, at ConnectiCon, because we keep forcing in all this sort of academic content, most of our anime panels are the Charles Dunbar style panel, and suddenly we're getting a lot more high brow submissions as time goes on, and a lot more people are going to panels than they used

39
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:12,588
Scott: to.

40
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,370
Scott: They're all people we know that are running the panels mostly.

41
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:18,790
Rym: No, we've branched out to friend of a friend at this point.

42
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,314
Rym: Whoa.

43
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:22,910
Rym: Well, I guess professional friends of a professional friend.

44
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:23,648
Scott: Non-violator.

45
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,170
Scott: What do you call nepotism if it's friends and not family?

46
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,529
Rym: It's still nepotism.

47
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,369
Scott: Preference, preferential treatment.

48
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:39,590
Rym: Really all you've really got to do to be good by me is spell most of the words correctly and not be about Homestuck or Ascanation.

49
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,626
Rym: And about Homestuck would be fine if your thing wasn't the same as Ascanation just with Homestuck.

50
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:58,950
Rym: Anyway, I'm kind of annoyed that I'm seeing conventions scheduling more rather than less of those, and yet I know that panels that they could have had that were objectively better in every way were not scheduled.

51
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,069
Scott: It's a low brow convention that does that.

52
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:01,318
Scott: Yeah.

53
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,989
Scott: That's all there is to it.

54
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:03,327
Scott: Yep.

55
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,570
Scott: They're doing it on purpose.

56
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:07,830
Rym: So anyway.

57
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:09,202
Scott: Anyway.

58
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:09,576
Scott: Anyway.

59
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,370
Scott: Yeah, there's not a lot of news going on, at least not that I know of, but I want to geek bite something.

60
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:15,848
Scott: You know what?

61
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,329
Scott: I haven't really watched a lot of anime or read a lot of comics lately.

62
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,808
Rym: I've been watching anime.

63
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,280
Rym: I mean, Emily and I did that show on Shinsekai Yori.

64
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,740
Rym: now that we finished it and moving on to either...

65
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,930
Scott: Notice I wasn't on that show because not watching a lot of anime.

66
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,570
Rym: Yeah, captain.

67
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,167
Rym: I'm moving on to, I think either, I don't know, there's two or three shows I might watch next.

68
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:34,690
Scott: Anyway.

69
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:41,290
Scott: But one comic I did read recently was Adventure Time comic.

70
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:48,490
Rym: I have not read the Adventure Time comics yet, except the one that I have a copy of because Yuko and Anoth did the side story in it.

71
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,650
Rym: I have... Marceline and the Scream Queens.

72
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,670
Scott: I ordered basically all the available trades and I got the first trade, which I read.

73
00:04:55,692 --> 00:05:08,590
Scott: And basically all I can say about it is it's a lot like, say the Simpsons comic or the Pony comic where it's the show more of in comic form, slightly different, right?

74
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:16,709
Scott: You know, where there's more sorts of, you know, it appeals to a narrower audience because it is in the comic medium, right?

75
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:27,227
Scott: As opposed to the show, which, you know, anyone and everyone is watching it, but not so narrowly as say the Simpsons comic, which will make like comic book nerd jokes more heavily than the Simpsons show.

76
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:27,710
Scott: Yeah.

77
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,590
Scott: I say only a superhero fan might understand like a radioactive man comic.

78
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:36,650
Scott: If you read Adventure Time, you will get the Adventure Time comic, right?

79
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,270
Scott: But if you're not in Adventure Time, the Adventure Time comic might not be the best place to start, right?

80
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,409
Scott: It's like for existing Adventure Time people...

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:54,089
Rym: Well, you know, it's funny for a non-serial show, you really got to have seen a bunch of it to be able to really get why some of the things that happen in later episodes are funny.

82
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:54,810
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

83
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,810
Rym: But it's not the same kind of self referentialist you get in like a Venture Brothers or an Archer.

84
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:06,309
Rym: It's more like because you know the character, things are funny as opposed to they're referencing the ants again.

85
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,030
Scott: Exactly.

86
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:15,450
Scott: So if you're an Adventure Time person and you've watched all Adventure Time there is and you want more Adventure Time, you should probably read the Adventure Time comic.

87
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,730
Scott: You can basically consider it part of Adventure Time as far as I'm concerned.

88
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:24,049
Scott: And I've noticed this has been happening more in recent years is a lot of TV shows.

89
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,050
Scott: when they're sort of done, they continue in comics, right?

90
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:27,810
Rym: Like the Simpsons?

91
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,412
Scott: Oh!

92
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:31,945
Scott: No, I mean like, well, for example, right?

93
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:39,290
Scott: Like Buffy season whatever is in, you know, I don't know how many seasons it was on TV and I'm not a fan of it anyway.

94
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:41,086
Scott: I watch eight episodes.

95
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,210
Scott: Basically, it continues in comics canon, right?

96
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,690
Scott: X-Files is a season that continues in comics after the end of it, right?

97
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,649
Rym: All these, it's that sort of a thing that people don't have a lower barrier to entry to like start it.

98
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,890
Rym: They have a lower maintenance to continue going as long as you own the license to it.

99
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:00,950
Rym: And especially if it's something that's nerdily popular.

100
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:10,609
Rym: You're pretty much guaranteed to be able to get a cavalcade of pretty good artists and writers who would be more than happy to take up the mantle and keep making it.

101
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,145
Scott: Yep.

102
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,049
Scott: So yeah, if you're interested in that, it's there for you.

103
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:22,169
Rym: The Adventure Time comic is pretty great, but if you think you're not an Adventure Time person, you haven't watched it yet, you should watch it.

104
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,370
Rym: It's actually, now that Ponies is kind of in a free fall, we'll see what happens to season four.

105
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:28,150
Rym: Free fall?

106
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,729
Scott: I mean, Ponies is already splat as far as I'm concerned.

107
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,150
Rym: No, no, because, all right, so forget Equestria Girls, because that's basically an OAV.

108
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,208
Rym: And you know how OAVs go.

109
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,090
Rym: Season one and two were great.

110
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,064
Rym: Season three was eh.

111
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:44,710
Rym: So really it comes down to whether or not season four picks up or...

112
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:49,430
Scott: If you don't watch Equestria Girls, you're not going to know what happened between season three and four.

113
00:07:50,091 --> 00:08:00,708
Rym: I have a feeling that she gets her crown back by winning the prom queen whatever, and whatever reason that girl who stole her crown had was actually some demon inside of her.

114
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,310
Rym: that's overcome with the power of friendship.

115
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:04,910
Rym: Somehow I think that's how it's going to go.

116
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,510
Rym: It's basically going to be the Sailor Moon movie.

117
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,210
Scott: Someone told me that it's Twilight, you know, basically has to earn the crown.

118
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,429
Scott: You learn how to be a princess in the human world.

119
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,170
Rym: But the princess of a prom is the worst way to learn how to be a princess.

120
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,769
Scott: I didn't say it was.

121
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,849
Scott: Someone just told me that's what it's about on the internet.

122
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,229
Scott: Some internet guy said that.

123
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,464
Rym: Right now, I think Adventure Time is my favorite television show.

124
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,823
Rym: that is currently ongoing, period.

125
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:31,810
Scott: For me, my favorite television show...

126
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,549
Rym: Because Ghost in the Shell has not started yet in a form that I can watch.

127
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:42,227
Scott: For me, my favorite television show that is currently ongoing is NHL Stanley Cup Finals on NBC.

128
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,102
Rym: Okay.

129
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,629
Scott: My second favorite...

130
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,729
Rym: Adventure Time is my number two.

131
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,849
Scott: My second favorite TV show that is on television right now...

132
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,748
Rym: It won't be long.

133
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,528
Rym: Wait a minute, no.

134
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,429
Scott: It's Running Man.

135
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:56,906
Rym: By the time the Stanley Cup ends, Adventure Time is going to be almost done too for the season.

136
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:57,873
Rym: So...

137
00:08:58,392 --> 00:08:59,749
Scott: And South Park's up there as well.

138
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,088
Rym: South Park's not running right now.

139
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,830
Scott: When is South Park going to run again?

140
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,887
Rym: I don't even... I don't know how TV seasons work in the U.S.

141
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:06,250
Rym: anymore.

142
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,450
Rym: All I know is occasionally there's New South Park.

143
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,070
Scott: South Park is weird because they split everything in half.

144
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,584
Rym: Yep.

145
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:17,250
Rym: But honestly, right now, Adventure Brothers, the new season, one, the first episode is just an hour long movie.

146
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,770
Rym: And two, they have upped the game on making that show.

147
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:30,350
Rym: That... The new season of Venture Brothers actually catapulted it from a show I really liked to just under ponies, Archer, Adventure Time.

148
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:38,270
Rym: So I had to geek about it myself because the show we're talking about was part of the Young Animator training project, so we'll talk about that in the main bit.

149
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,410
Rym: But Emily and I, the other day, watched the old man's lamp, Ojisan no Ranpu.

150
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,688
Scott: That sounds good to me.

151
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,510
Rym: So you should watch it.

152
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,747
Scott: Is it a magic lamp or is it a lamp like, "Oh, the new lamp is much

153
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:53,129
Scott: better.".

154
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,750
Rym: So the new lamp is much better.

155
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:55,990
Rym: Here's the rough plot.

156
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:57,730
Rym: One, it's animated beautifully.

157
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:58,989
Rym: It's well done.

158
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,270
Rym: I like almost every aspect of it, but it's unintentionally hilarious at a couple of points.

159
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,510
Scott: Oh, unintentional.

160
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,150
Scott: So it's trying to be serious, but it fails?

161
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:08,110
Rym: Not quite.

162
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:09,309
Rym: You really got to watch it.

163
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:16,849
Rym: But the story is basically a kid finds this thing in his attic and starts fucking around with it like it's a laser gun.

164
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,186
Rym: And then the grandpa is like, "Give me that lamp, you

165
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:19,609
Rym: ass.".

166
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:23,490
Rym: And then later he tells his son the story of the lamp.

167
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:33,410
Rym: And it's this old oil burning lamp from just when Japan was starting to become Westernized and people didn't really use lamps and electricity wasn't available everywhere yet.

168
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:42,527
Rym: So this kid starts selling... He sees a lamp, he makes a deal, and he starts selling lamps to people in Japan and makes his industry around it.

169
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,030
Rym: But then electricity is coming.

170
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:45,804
Rym: Oh no.

171
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:51,490
Rym: And it's basically the buggy whip manufacturer's dilemma, but it's really well done.

172
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:52,908
Rym: It's really good.

173
00:10:53,290 --> 00:11:00,528
Rym: And all I want to say is when you get to the end of it, they don't tell you really what came next.

174
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,449
Rym: But I assume that that grandpa became a pimp.

175
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:06,407
Scott: Okay.

176
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:07,569
Rym: You should watch it.

177
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,088
Rym: It's great.

178
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:13,386
Rym: If you're a fan of anime or animation at all, there is literally no reason not to watch this.

179
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:16,069
Rym: In fact, the whole thing's on YouTube right now.

180
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:28,000
Scott: You know, that sounded a lot more like a thing of the day than a news.

181
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,320
Rym: Well, I do have a thing of the day, but that was a geek bite.

182
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,139
Rym: I reviewed it.

183
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,120
Rym: I don't review my things of the day.

184
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,840
Rym: It is assumed that they are awesome.

185
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,060
Rym: But the Young Animator Training Project, Ojisan no Lampu, is great.

186
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:40,998
Rym: And you should watch it.

187
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:41,819
Rym: That is my review.

188
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:49,100
Rym: My thing of the day is the good night for flying kind of prank that I like so much.

189
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:51,540
Rym: It's a really simple prank too.

190
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,280
Rym: And I urge all of you to do this to people.

191
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,176
Rym: Basically, they get this guy and he has a hood on like a hoodie and he stands in the elevator.

192
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,300
Scott: Like a Sith Lord.

193
00:11:59,620 --> 00:11:59,692
Rym: Yep.

194
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,060
Rym: Just staring straight face.

195
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,440
Rym: Just standing there kind of creepy.

196
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:07,060
Rym: And every time the doors about to close, he just waves his arm very subtly.

197
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,537
Scott: Sort of like that old video where the guy's the magician, he's moving the subway with his hands.

198
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,699
Scott: The psychic powers.

199
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,357
Scott: Subway move.

200
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,300
Rym: And then the doors just magically open.

201
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:20,160
Rym: And the reaction to the various people are great.

202
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,180
Rym: One guy's like, the force is strong with this one.

203
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,979
Rym: They kind of laughs.

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,058
Rym: But then he kind of backs away from the guy.

205
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:30,540
Scott: The other guy's like, you need or something and there's like, can you do it again?

206
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,058
Rym: He does again.

207
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:36,180
Rym: The guy's like, oh, uh, but just watch the video.

208
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:43,060
Rym: If you can't figure out how they're doing the prank before you watch the video, you see the bear playing basketball.

209
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:47,740
Rym: This is my kind of prank.

210
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,816
Rym: I hope to all the gods, they never explained to anyone in those elevators what was going on.

211
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:59,320
Rym: I wouldn't make it star Wars though, because I'm a big fan of creepy pasta lately.

212
00:12:59,361 --> 00:12:59,998
Rym: If you couldn't tell.

213
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:00,437
Rym: Okay.

214
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,680
Rym: So if I was going to do it, I would have the guy just be kind of creepy and twitchy just sitting in the elevator.

215
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:09,180
Rym: And every time the doors go to close, he'd be like, no, no, open.

216
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:12,260
Rym: And then the doors open again because then it's also creepy.

217
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:18,460
Rym: It's like, then the prank is more like, instead of no one would think star Wars, they'd think, is this guy psychic?

218
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:19,506
Rym: Like?

219
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:20,520
Rym: is this that moment?

220
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:23,239
Rym: Is this like that scene in the movie where that guy's about to flip out?

221
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:25,420
Scott: Okay.

222
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:27,459
Scott: So what is my thing of the day?

223
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:38,060
Scott: Well, here's an anime known as turning girls, and this is episode one of turning girls and episode one of turning goals is free to watch on YouTube and has been built in subtitles.

224
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:39,379
Scott: And it's a five minute show.

225
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:40,840
Scott: You know, I like those tiny animes.

226
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,680
Rym: We got to add this to our panel on a bite-sized anime.

227
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,040
Scott: Along with infinite.

228
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,338
Rym: No cop.

229
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:57,420
Scott: Anyway, this episode is about basically this girl who, you know, thinks she is an idol and I guess is big, the least popular idol in all of Japan.

230
00:13:58,184 --> 00:13:59,499
Scott: And she works at a maid cafe.

231
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:08,380
Scott: And there's these six people, three dudes and three girls who are on sort of a group date situation that a nice Japanese, you know, bar or whatever, like you do in Japan.

232
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:08,736
Scott: Right.

233
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:18,739
Scott: And one of the girls invited Kaoru, who is the idol girl, and the rest of the episodes about her being her.

234
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:19,560
Scott: And yeah.

235
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,012
Scott: Watch it.

236
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:27,660
Rym: It's funny because I asked Scott about three quarters of the way through and I quote, this could be classified as dangerous almost.

237
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,719
Rym: So does this end with them shooting her?

238
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,960
Scott: This could be classified as dangerous.

239
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,480
Rym: It's pretty dangerous.

240
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:41,395
Rym: But what's, I guess, extra dangerous is that Emily and I had a big trip to Japan a while ago and we went to a maid cafe.

241
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,140
Rym: and you know what?

242
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:47,840
Rym: They sound, look and act exactly like that.

243
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:56,829
Rym: So imagine being in a cafe where everyone who isn't sitting is acting like that 110%.

244
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,938
Rym: That is what it is like.

245
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,579
Rym: So yeah.

246
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:01,880
Rym: Met a moment.

247
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:04,440
Rym: The book club book was player of games in and banks.

248
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,078
Rym: The show is up.

249
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:06,519
Rym: You should read the book.

250
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,479
Scott: What's the new book club book?

251
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,579
Rym: The new book club book.

252
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:11,200
Rym: I'm still deciding.

253
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,716
Scott: You suck.

254
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,777
Rym: Partly because I really want to do the thing that I talked about before.

255
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:16,973
Scott: I could just decide for you.

256
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:17,698
Rym: No.

257
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:25,059
Rym: Well, the thing is, if you push me at all, it's going to be the fucking count of Monte Cristo or Ulysses or some shit can't be Ulysses.

258
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,059
Rym: I could do Ulysses.

259
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,739
Scott: I've never read it.

260
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,294
Scott: That's the one.

261
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:31,440
Scott: That is the only book that is not allowed permanently on any book.

262
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,899
Rym: Have you ever read it?

263
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,858
Scott: No, no plan to.

264
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,547
Rym: How do you know?

265
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:35,238
Rym: it's not great?

266
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:38,779
Rym: Like Gatsby.

267
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,096
Scott: How would you like to bet on it?

268
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,100
Scott: Well, could you even finish it while we're still doing GeekNights?

269
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:48,460
Rym: I don't know.

270
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,699
Rym: I blew through the county Monte Cristo.

271
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,980
Rym: Let's make it from hell by Alan Moore.

272
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,778
Scott: How about that?

273
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:54,939
Scott: How would you like that?

274
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,553
Scott: I finished it.

275
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,197
Rym: You know, you really want to ask me about it.

276
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:00,420
Rym: You really want to play this game, Scott.

277
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:04,520
Rym: I'll just pick one of my nonfiction history books and you will fucking hate me.

278
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,251
Rym: All of you.

279
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:06,353
Rym: I just won't read it.

280
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:08,879
Rym: You're not going to read the book club book?

281
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,815
Scott: Not if it's like Peter the Great, 10,000 pages.

282
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,319
Rym: Actually that Peter the Great book is pretty great.

283
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:24,178
Rym: No, it actually is really great because Peter the Great is kind of a funny dude and when they went to war with Sweden, the King of Sweden was kind of a moron.

284
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,479
Rym: Anyway, that was our bathroom reader for a while.

285
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,859
Scott: Your bathroom reader, my bathroom.

286
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,540
Rym: Sigh and look at her, you know, how many people in beacon when they'd come over, they'd come out of the bathroom.

287
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,693
Rym: There'd be like, so, uh, the only book in your bathroom is a biography of Peter the Great.

288
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:43,139
Rym: And I was like, yup.

289
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,000
Rym: They're like, so did you just leave it in there by accident?

290
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:53,840
Rym: I was like, nope, but yeah, uh, Connecticut will be there doing a bunch of panels, running the panels department along with Kristen.

291
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:55,440
Rym: Uh, shit's going to be awesome.

292
00:16:56,021 --> 00:17:02,057
Rym: We're going to be at PAX OS doing on Friday and 1pm in the Wombat theater beyond dungeons and dragons.

293
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:05,920
Rym: Uh, we're putting in our stuff for a PAX prime.

294
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,780
Rym: We got one or two good offerings probably in the making.

295
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,579
Rym: Still working on our PAX dev stuff.

296
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,640
Rym: Join our forum.

297
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:11,934
Rym: Crap.

298
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:13,199
Rym: Watch our videos.

299
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,000
Rym: Uh, watch one of our anime Boston panels.

300
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,714
Rym: We uploaded it.

301
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:17,818
Rym: Anything else?

302
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:19,499
Rym: Any meta?

303
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:21,980
Scott: Um, I can't think of any other meta.

304
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,400
Rym: No meta, no, no meta.

305
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:41,238
Rym: So the young animator training project, basically Japan, the agency for cultural affairs, Emily told me about this a while ago and we've been meaning to actually watch all these things, put together a couple of million bucks and set up a fund to basically train animators on the job.

306
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:46,160
Rym: So here's some money, make some animation and there's more details to it.

307
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:59,860
Rym: I'll link to the Wikipedia, but basically, like I said, that, uh, the old man's lamp was one of these from 2010. project a, the show we're reviewing tonight that Scott and I both just watched was from this year, little witch academia.

308
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,779
Scott: So little witch academia is from a studio called trigger, which is, seems to be a recently created studio.

309
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:16,000
Scott: Um, and the other thing that they made is inferno cup, which is very important and dangerous and you need to watch that ASAP, but we're not going to talk about inferno cop.

310
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,860
Scott: We're talking about little witch academia, which is made by trigger.

311
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,400
Scott: And it seems to me, the trigger is sort of this, you know, Japanese anime studio.

312
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:43,019
Scott: And it may not be making the best anime in the universe, like Ghibli or any, you know, I G or something, but they're making damn good animes and they seem to actually understand the kind of animes people want to see, especially in the U S and they seem to be hip to the modern world and the way the internet works.

313
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:53,578
Scott: I mean, inferno cop was free to watch on YouTube with subtitles, little witch academia is free to watch on YouTube and other places at least until the end of this month ish.

314
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:54,360
Scott: Right.

315
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,320
Scott: And I think even after the end of this month, it's still going to be on crunchy roll to just watch with subtitles.

316
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,000
Scott: Right.

317
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:08,580
Scott: Well, Scott, they really get it, you know, there and the anime they make are the kind of animes that appeal to modern people's people of the internet.

318
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:10,260
Rym: So you know, who founded trigger?

319
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,260
Scott: They're not a fan service.

320
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:12,635
Scott: Who would that be?

321
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,499
Rym: Uh, two X guy next guys.

322
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,087
Scott: There you go.

323
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:16,818
Scott: So how about that?

324
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,979
Scott: These people seem to know what's up.

325
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:28,880
Scott: So little which academia is like Rym said, the young animators, whatever, you know, like a T on a meta, you could say poodle Jack Utah, right?

326
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:41,780
Scott: So trigger got some of that money and they made this, uh, like 20, 30 minutes short called little witch academia, which pretty high production values, which also actually the, uh, the lamp one also pretty high production values.

327
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:45,919
Scott: And we watched it just now, like five minutes ago.

328
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,056
Rym: So again, we're not going to spoil because it's a short, just what are you going to spoil in that?

329
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,200
Rym: But the short even that like, just watch it.

330
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,720
Scott: If you're an, if you're even listening to GeekNights, you could watch it in less time than it would take to listen to the rest of this GeekNights episode.

331
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,099
Scott: Probably made it seriously.

332
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:06,080
Rym: We say this every time we review a short OAV, a movie, a short.

333
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:12,620
Rym: If you're an anime fan at all, there is literally zero reason to not watch these things.

334
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,880
Rym: There aren't that many things like this.

335
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,300
Rym: You can watch them easily.

336
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,340
Rym: You can watch them quickly.

337
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,780
Rym: They're self-contained and we already told you they're good.

338
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,975
Rym: Have we ever lied to you?

339
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:30,340
Rym: Have we ever said something was good and you legitimately thought it was not good or at least didn't understand why we said it was good.

340
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,539
Scott: And if that's the case, why are you still listening to GeekNights?

341
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,439
Rym: I mean, maybe there's all the Ava haters.

342
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:41,620
Rym: I mean, we've told people things are bad that they thought was good, but that's the separate problem.

343
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,380
Rym: You want the filter that's too narrow, not the filter that's too broad.

344
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,225
Rym: So little witch academia.

345
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:53,819
Rym: in my mind, it's just, it's adorable because it starts kind of in media res.

346
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:55,180
Rym: It does the right thing.

347
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,740
Rym: It doesn't tell you shit.

348
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,580
Rym: It basically just shows you everything.

349
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:06,300
Rym: The little world that they've set out for this 26 minute short just sort of unfolds in front of you, explains itself, and then ends.

350
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,759
Rym: The story begins.

351
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,760
Rym: Everything's foreshadowed elegantly to a T in fact.

352
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,780
Rym: Every scene serves a purpose.

353
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,620
Rym: Every scene is beautifully animated.

354
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:17,279
Rym: The characters are funny.

355
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:27,000
Rym: They remind me of the tropes just like in, I don't know, Princess Tutu, Utena, other shows that have these similar sorts of tropes.

356
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,039
Scott: Yeah, this thing pretty hits.

357
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:37,880
Scott: It hits on all these standard anime formulas and things that I've seen a million times before, but it hits them in the perfect combination and executes each one exactly right.

358
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,700
Scott: You know, I mean, you've got, you know, a little girl who's, you know, not sure.

359
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,560
Scott: She looks up to some, you know, super magic and that's what she wants.

360
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,940
Scott: She has some goal in the future.

361
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,660
Rym: I mean, super magic is basically an idol and no one else respects her, right?

362
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:55,440
Scott: It's like, how do you know, where have I seen that before?

363
00:21:55,641 --> 00:22:07,220
Scott: I can't think of one right now and I feel dumb, but I feel like I've seen that in a hundred animes before, but it's got the right, you know, shows like this, shorts like this could be really pedestrian.

364
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:10,440
Rym: And this one isn't because it's got a lot of style.

365
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:20,140
Rym: The characters are all very different, drawn very differently and have very different personalities and some dark shit just kind of happens in the course of all this.

366
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:26,459
Rym: And like, not to spoil, but the one of the girls who's kind of Kitaro looking, I think she's my favorite character.

367
00:22:27,164 --> 00:22:28,320
Scott: Oh, that's your favorite one?

368
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,140
Rym: That's my favorite one.

369
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:29,893
Scott: Okay.

370
00:22:30,841 --> 00:22:34,557
Rym: Cause there's this moment where they're fighting this minotaur and she's just like, I'll just poison it.

371
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:38,100
Rym: And the poison's effects are horrifying.

372
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:41,640
Rym: And she's just like, ah, I guess I made that a little too strong.

373
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,719
Rym: And everyone around her is like, oh my God, what did you just do?

374
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:47,939
Rym: I think she's going to grow up to be evil.

375
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:49,919
Scott: Uh, sure.

376
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,454
Scott: But yeah, I mean, it's another thing is you have all the, you know, this.

377
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:58,740
Scott: usually animes like to have a cast of characters, one to sort of fit every different mold, right?

378
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,738
Scott: You know, the, you need the full set and this one sort of at the, at the one time, right?

379
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,399
Scott: It doesn't bring in some of the ones that are usually there, like the wacky, annoying person, not there.

380
00:23:09,786 --> 00:23:10,060
Scott: Right.

381
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,840
Scott: The, and it, and the other end, it bring it, you think it's bringing in some of the other typical ones like bitchy, annoying person, right?

382
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,778
Rym: Which I guess is Diana or whatever, but she does the full Nanami arc in the course of this a little short.

383
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:23,280
Scott: Yeah.

384
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,371
Scott: Yeah.

385
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,720
Scott: It's just like within this, you know, very, very short episode, it's like she covers everything and it's like, oh, okay.

386
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:30,640
Scott: She's not really that annoying anymore.

387
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:31,218
Rym: Yup.

388
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,700
Rym: Well also I liked the fact that she or her confidence and her arrogance was kind of justified.

389
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:36,440
Scott: Yeah.

390
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,239
Rym: Cause she was just better than everyone else.

391
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,040
Scott: She was just better than everyone else.

392
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,278
Scott: There's no question about that.

393
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:41,779
Scott: Yup.

394
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:48,600
Scott: It's not like one of those situations where it's like, oh, I'm, you know, it was sort of like, is she, um, what's it called?

395
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,680
Scott: You know, silver spoon and, uh, no, no, cause they've got no redeeming quality.

396
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:54,298
Scott: Exactly.

397
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:55,020
Scott: Right.

398
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:05,560
Scott: It's, it's totally leading the other direction, you know, while hinting that she might be like that, but she's not, um, you know, the main character is pretty typical, right?

399
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:11,178
Scott: Sort of like, you know, clumsy, not as good as everyone else, you know, has to really improve.

400
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:20,380
Scott: Um, but not, you know, it's not, it's not one of those cases where it's like the main character is the generic, every person that ends up being nobody.

401
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,119
Rym: She's got a pretty distinct, okay.

402
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,819
Rym: I'm looking at the internet.

403
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,420
Rym: I'm not the only one who thinks that girl has the same hair as Fluttershy.

404
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,838
Scott: Which one?

405
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:27,716
Rym: The creepy one.

406
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:28,916
Scott: What?

407
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:32,280
Scott: Uh, oh, now I totally see it and I didn't see it before.

408
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,106
Rym: Yeah.

409
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:34,250
Scott: And you know what else I see?

410
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,379
Rym: All the fan art of hers, her poisoning people too.

411
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,799
Scott: That's what she does.

412
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:42,459
Scott: I kind of like that cause you know, I make jokes about poisoning all the time.

413
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:44,660
Rym: So I think we can, we picked that up from Rotenna.

414
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:45,420
Scott: Yeah.

415
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,296
Scott: So, but I mean, so to have someone who's actually a poisoner, uh, and that's like their special attack.

416
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:52,339
Scott: That's pretty cool.

417
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,878
Rym: Well, it's like in Madoka when someone's special attack initially is I'll hit it with a golf club over and over again.

418
00:24:59,740 --> 00:24:59,820
Rym: Yep.

419
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:08,819
Rym: But yeah, they, I think specifically if I wanted to say something about this short, because again, it's too short to say much more.

420
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,158
Rym: It's very well animated and the animation is really stylized and cartoony in a good way.

421
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,419
Rym: The characters make great faces.

422
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,340
Rym: There's very stuff doesn't appear to be reused.

423
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,078
Rym: Like this dragon at the end that keeps growing, keeps getting drawn completely differently as it gets bigger.

424
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:27,800
Scott: Yep.

425
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:36,779
Scott: That was, that was something I was really impressed with actually is like, you know, it's like, Oh, obviously this is the stereotypical case of you did the wrong thing to the bad guys.

426
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,697
Scott: So it keeps getting stronger, but then it's like, Oh, actually they consider just making it bigger.

427
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,180
Scott: They keep redrawing it and it kept getting bigger and bigger constantly.

428
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:49,160
Scott: Like every few seconds it's a completely different monster, right?

429
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:55,847
Scott: Even though it's still the one bad guy, it just changes so fast and they're so creative in the ways they make it bigger.

430
00:25:55,988 --> 00:26:05,278
Scott: and you know, instead of just increasing the size, changing the shape while still making it completely recognizably the same guy, you know, it's like, Oh, that's pretty awesome right there.

431
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:15,360
Rym: Now I have to say too, the pacing is really good and it every, every time it gets to that moment where a more pedestrian anime or short would immediately look up.

432
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,379
Rym: Now they're going to do X and I got to wait for X to resolve because that's what always happens in shows like this.

433
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,460
Rym: It would basically immediately cut or move on to the next plot point.

434
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:29,099
Rym: And the plot happens basically immediately that I have nothing bad to say about this thing at all.

435
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:36,000
Rym: It was definitely not a waste of my 20 whatever minutes, if this was a 26 episode show, I would watch all of it without even thinking.

436
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:36,820
Scott: Yeah, probably.

437
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,380
Scott: It might not.

438
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:44,039
Scott: The thing is if it was a 26th of it was a show, it might not be an a show, but it might be, it would be at least to be.

439
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:48,179
Scott: And I would definitely, you know, it's like if there was an episode too, I would want to watch it right now.

440
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:48,800
Scott: No question.

441
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:58,299
Rym: If every episode we're like this, a complete self and cane story like that with that, especially since there is still so many things yet to be revealed that were alluded to.

442
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:07,020
Rym: There's so many little touches like the, the better girls have those like portable brooms that they just stick on their wands and go and all these little things just kind of there.

443
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:17,119
Rym: And even at the end, the thing that we guessed that was correct was revealed to be correct, but it was revealed to be correct in the appropriately subtle way.

444
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:24,679
Rym: That is so rare in the modern, uh, don't show me something when you can tell me with a long monologue style that I see so often.

445
00:27:27,182 --> 00:27:30,616
Rym: Also I like how the girl didn't seem to wake up in the beginning when the teacher knocked her over.

446
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,100
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

447
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,640
Rym: Also, here's a picture that was in fact a My Little Pony they found in that room.

448
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:37,459
Scott: Okay.

449
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,860
Rym: So I wonder if there's this My Little Pony in it and the one character is there.

450
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,919
Scott: I made a joke about magic kindergarten, which is a My Little Pony joke.

451
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:46,495
Rym: Yup.

452
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:52,480
Rym: And the main girl, I was thinking Twilight Sparkle just because of the way they were interacting probably because of that kindergarten joke.

453
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:52,760
Scott: Wow.

454
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,658
Scott: That is a Twilight Sparkle.

455
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:54,110
Scott: Yeah.

456
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,720
Rym: And the other girl's hair looks like Fluttershy.

457
00:27:57,021 --> 00:27:59,500
Rym: I bet the people involved in this are fans of My Little Pony.

458
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:00,439
Scott: It's possible.

459
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,580
Rym: There's no way they're not.

460
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,120
Scott: It's a greater than zero chance.

461
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,040
Rym: I mean, look, this is a key frame.

462
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:07,900
Rym: She picks it up, looks at it, then it falls apart and bugs come out of it.

463
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:11,740
Rym: But yeah, so yeah.

464
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:12,939
Rym: Watch this thing.

465
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,640
Rym: Seriously.

466
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,079
Rym: Like right now, if you're an anime fan, just watch it.

467
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,957
Scott: Yeah, seriously, unless you're like driving to work or some shit, you are not doing anything right now.

468
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,600
Scott: You can go to your computer for 20 minutes and watch an anime.

469
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,099
Scott: That's good.

470
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,270
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

471
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,370
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

472
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,810
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

473
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,730
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

474
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,470
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

475
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,006
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

476
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,310
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

477
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,430
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
