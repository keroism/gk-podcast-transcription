1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,733
Rym: It's Monday May 1st, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:14,880
Rym: We're going to talk about internet hosting solutions.

3
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:17,258
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:32,640
Rym: We had a wonderful weekend after our we show Though I will note that as it's now allergy season I have a screaming headache and my nose is full of various unmentionables, so I might sound a little off today.

5
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:36,151
Scott: I'm just awesome because I don't have allergies.

6
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:37,174
Scott: Yeah.

7
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:42,274
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty much immune to Everything except maybe girlfriends.

8
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:43,058
Scott: no.

9
00:00:53,461 --> 00:01:02,079
Scott: So yesterday I upgraded the hosting that we have not for the mp3 files of eat nights But for everything else the forum and the website and the feeds.

10
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,991
Scott: well I guess the feeds are on feed burner But the WordPress where the feed burner feeds come from and all that.

11
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:17,964
Scott: you might have noticed a slight short interruption to service yeah, last night when no one was using it anyway, but basically the Everything is doubled.

12
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:24,686
Scott: We have twice as much CPU twice as much RAM twice as much hard drive space Twice as much bandwidth.

13
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,858
Rym: So we're doing our best to fill that up right quick.

14
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:32,060
Scott: Yep However, we also doubled the money we pay for it.

15
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,117
Scott: So what was once 40 bucks a month is now 80 a month.

16
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:40,040
Rym: So for anyone who's curious because it was asked of us before and we didn't really give a solid number.

17
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:44,456
Rym: It cost us a grand total of twelve hundred dollars a year to host GeekNights.

18
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:48,247
Scott: Yep, which is Considering is two of us a pittance.

19
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,671
Scott: It's pretty much a pittance.

20
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:59,760
Scott: However, when I thought about it, I was like ugh 80 times 12 is 960. it kind of made me go but I'm paying it anyway, cuz I don't care.

21
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:13,400
Scott: However in the past someone came up to us and was like, hey, I wanted to PayPal you money But there was no PayPal button and I was like, yeah, we don't really need money because we have money from our jobs.

22
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:20,774
Scott: But now because I'm paying twice as much a month I'm not asking anyone to PayPal us money.

23
00:02:20,794 --> 00:02:21,880
Rym: Yeah, don't send us money.

24
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,179
Scott: In fact, I'm telling you don't send us money because we probably have more money than you.

25
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:35,980
Scott: but I have put a PayPal donate thing like in the Darkest corner of the front row crew comm page in the bottom right somewhere.

26
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,208
Rym: Yeah, we basically just wanted to mention it on the show.

27
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:41,460
Rym: So people don't see it and think oh, they're hurting for money.

28
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,166
Scott: No, we're not hurting for money.

29
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:45,215
Rym: We're not gonna pull a Nick you here.

30
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:48,770
Scott: No, we're not gonna pull it Which we'll talk about some other time.

31
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:49,495
Rym: We talked about it.

32
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,219
Scott: I think did we?

33
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:52,647
Rym: Actually, that was like long story short.

34
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:53,691
Scott: some guy made a webcomic.

35
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:54,413
Scott: That was awesome.

36
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:55,598
Scott: He said help.

37
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:56,220
Scott: I need money.

38
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,709
Scott: We all gave him like a dollar.

39
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,620
Scott: He made two more comics and then he ran away.

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,761
Rym: Asshole.

41
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:01,944
Rym: we talked about that.

42
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,930
Rym: I'm like the fifth or sixth episode of GeekNights.

43
00:03:04,171 --> 00:03:04,472
Scott: All right.

44
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,320
Scott: Anyway, so there's a PayPal donate there.

45
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,379
Scott: It's not there because we need money.

46
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:17,385
Scott: It's there because if you are so crazy that you just want to give us money I'm not gonna deny you.

47
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,110
Scott: previously we were denying you.

48
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:19,652
Scott: now.

49
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:22,420
Scott: We are no longer denying you the ability to give us money.

50
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,470
Scott: We're just trying to tell you not to.

51
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:29,745
Rym: it's like the custom in some places where you have to refuse a gift three times And then you take it grudgingly.

52
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:31,794
Scott: Well that it's not a show though.

53
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:32,838
Scott: We really don't want to take.

54
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:39,239
Scott: yeah But if you are so crazy that you want to give it to us, we won't deny you the ability to do so.

55
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,600
Rym: freedom Yeah, but we're really not hurting for money.

56
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,122
Rym: I mean, actually I'm going to be making quite a bit more money because I was just offered a job that I think I'm going To take.

57
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,736
Scott: yeah, and if my job doesn't give me some work to do.

58
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,744
Scott: in the next two weeks I'm gonna be looking for a new job.

59
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,370
Scott: So yeah.

60
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:59,220
Rym: Yeah, actually once Scott gets a new job I think our household income will be six figures.

61
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,145
Scott: seriously Six figures.

62
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:13,957
Scott: two people no kids, obviously Obviously And considering we've already bought just about every gadget we need we can start going for the useless shit.

63
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:24,707
Scott: Yeah like Ferraris and double Hawks double Hawks Projectors oh, I know Mackintosh's.

64
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:33,671
Rym: yeah Yeah, but then we'll have one less excuse why we don't do AAC with enhanced whatnot which we're not gonna Do cuz I already gave ten reasons which is plenty.

65
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,219
Rym: Yeah, I'm glad no one brought it up again.

66
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:36,620
Scott: Yeah, okay.

67
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:49,791
Rym: So the show tonight is going to be about hosting because we changed the hosting and it's a pretty good idea Yep, especially since a tiny bit of research opened up a whole new topic We're going to talk about when we're in the garage in regards to hosting.

68
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,337
Scott: Okay, so let's do some.

69
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:59,533
Scott: news is first All right, so there was some news today about Linux getting an enhanced Wi-Fi stack.

70
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:05,020
Scott: if you don't know Support for wireless in Linux isn't terrific.

71
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:10,660
Scott: I mean you can get just about any wireless card to kind of somewhat work.

72
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:18,457
Scott: there are a few cards that work really really well and Most cards don't work at all or work poorly or hard.

73
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:28,920
Scott: to get them to work You have to use a thing called the NDIS wrapper Which basically means you take the Windows driver and you cram it in sideways into Linux like a square peg in a triangle hole.

74
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,033
Rym: It should be obvious why that's a bad idea.

75
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:35,593
Scott: Yeah, so this company be called device scape.

76
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:43,512
Scott: what they make is a stack and An advanced data path 802 11 driver stack.

77
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:51,860
Scott: if you don't know what this means It means this let's say Rym owns a company and Rym makes wireless cards for laptops and things.

78
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:55,038
Rym: We I only know to hire people to make Windows drivers.

79
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:57,045
Scott: No, no, you only know how to.

80
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:58,691
Scott: you don't even know how to make drivers.

81
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:04,230
Scott: you want to do as little driver making as possible Because you're mostly in the business of making and selling cards.

82
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,574
Rym: some other company has Windows.

83
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:07,100
Rym: they make drivers for me for Windows, right?

84
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,073
Scott: So device scape will sell you this 802 11 stack.

85
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:22,839
Scott: That means that if you want to make a driver to distribute with your wireless card that you want to sell You need to do very very little work because most of the work is done for you.

86
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,778
Scott: Give you all the meat and you just have to put some clothes on it.

87
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,499
Rym: I thought you were gonna say potatoes.

88
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,972
Rym: Okay, I don't know why you use the word meat.

89
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:31,999
Scott: I don't know.

90
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,529
Scott: So why all the meat and you just add the potatoes?

91
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,453
Rym: Yeah, okay.

92
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:36,055
Rym: What's what are?

93
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:37,320
Rym: you grill it up meat clothes?

94
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:40,200
Rym: I mean, I have a meat helmet, but it's a Bobby.

95
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:43,431
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna do a show on inside joke soon.

96
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:43,954
Scott: Okay.

97
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:44,557
Scott: Okay.

98
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:57,257
Rym: Okay, so Yeah Yeah, this is good news though I mean we had a friend Alex who had a laptop that for the longest time the wireless just couldn't make it work and it Was painful, right?

99
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:08,820
Scott: So this device scape company in the interests of themselves being more awesome has taken the code for their meat And they may gave it under the GPL to the Linux guys.

100
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:22,027
Scott: It'll probably take them a while to shove it in the kernel because I mean there's some stuff in the kernel that does the same Stuff that this does and there's some stuff in the kernel that does better than what this does and this does things better than What the kernel does in someplace?

101
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,260
Rym: Yeah, they're gonna have to look it over and mesh things together.

102
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:37,200
Scott: Yeah, so it's gonna take a while But the odds are pretty good that this code will make it into the Linux kernel Which will mean that it will be very very easy to get for people to write just about.

103
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:46,560
Scott: It'll be very very easy for Linux device driver writers to write a driver for just about any wireless computer using this stuff

104
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:57,518
Rym: Which is a good thing because a lot of the reason that hardware isn't supported in Linux is simply that the people who make the Hardware don't know or care or they don't want to put extra effort into something that not that many people use.

105
00:07:57,859 --> 00:08:02,915
Scott: Yeah The guys who write to make the hardware don't want to put any effort at all.

106
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:04,360
Scott: That's why device scape exists.

107
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:09,480
Scott: They did all the effort once so all the different hardware companies do the tiniest bit of effort.

108
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:17,697
Scott: So now if that company gives their stuff to Linux well Hey now only Linux has to do the tiniest bit of effort for each card, which they're just fine with.

109
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:18,339
Scott: it's piece of cake.

110
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:28,219
Scott: So wireless cards and the other thing is all of the crazy features of wireless cards that haven't worked quite So right in the past.

111
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:34,139
Scott: now they're gonna all work just great and wireless is gonna work faster and better and more reliably.

112
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,419
Rym: and Now if only we could get ATI to have something like that stupid ATI.

113
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:41,775
Scott: I mean they gave a driver ATI, but it's terrible.

114
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:42,520
Scott: It's terrible.

115
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,970
Scott: It's not nearly as good or reliable as the Nvidia driver.

116
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,438
Rym: Well, even in Windows the ATI drivers are pretty piss-poor.

117
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,051
Scott: Yep Yep.

118
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:50,233
Scott: Yep.

119
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:50,395
Scott: Yeah.

120
00:08:50,940 --> 00:09:03,288
Rym: So today I was poking around the internet and I noticed that CNN is running a story and msnbc picked it up That there was a virus for the Macintosh the OS X And I thought oh it finally happened.

121
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,134
Rym: then I read the story.

122
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:13,099
Rym: They were basically reporting on I'm pretty sure the Oompa Loompa Trojan that appeared back in like February or March.

123
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:19,840
Rym: Not only is it not a virus and is it nothing new, but it's really not a danger to anyone except an idiot.

124
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:24,900
Scott: How many times are we gonna hear some non technical news group?

125
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,946
Scott: Reporting on technical news because they're dumb.

126
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:29,832
Rym: now a lot of people have put forth that.

127
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:32,500
Rym: hmm msnbc was breaking this.

128
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,129
Rym: Hey, maybe a run-up to Vista.

129
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:37,887
Scott: I Don't think so, I don't know.

130
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:41,440
Scott: I think it's just another stupid tech journalist at the Associated Press.

131
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:48,914
Rym: The funny thing is that they was on FARC and mostly the comments for people with windows saying yeah You Linux you're uh, you uh, Macintosh people suck.

132
00:09:48,974 --> 00:09:49,920
Rym: You're just as bad as us.

133
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,284
Rym: There's people.

134
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:56,346
Rym: don't target you yet because you're not popular Still think that oh my god.

135
00:09:56,547 --> 00:10:00,760
Scott: Yeah, how many times do we need to debunk that stupid myth?

136
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:04,179
Rym: Yep to real briefly because I feel like debunking it again.

137
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,295
Rym: Macintoshes and Linux's are more secure by design.

138
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,760
Rym: There's no way around that.

139
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:14,500
Rym: They're not a hundred percent secure, but nothing in the world is a hundred percent secure.

140
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,205
Scott: Yeah, well there is there's.

141
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:23,099
Scott: there's a hundred something per hundred percent of cure a safe made of indestructible steel With the keys inside of it and it's locked.

142
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:25,927
Rym: There's no such thing as indestructible steel.

143
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:27,412
Scott: shut up.

144
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:29,299
Rym: black hole could get that open shut up.

145
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:34,967
Scott: but yeah, that's you know, I Mean there's the architect.

146
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:37,760
Rym: It's secure and the code is at least for Linux open.

147
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,209
Rym: So a lot of smart people look at it all the time.

148
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:47,539
Rym: and if some smart hacker thinks hey I can break in Some smart less evil hacker thinks hey, I can keep people from getting in and fix it.

149
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,221
Scott: Mm-hmm.

150
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:54,120
Rym: and as for Macintoshes, they put a lot of money into their software because their software is it that is their company now.

151
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:58,188
Scott: Well that and iPods It's really just the way.

152
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:58,549
Scott: I mean.

153
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:00,860
Scott: plan 9 is an operating system.

154
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:11,760
Scott: It's also a movie but that's that's where I got its name from and that's If you go to read about plan 9 just search on Google for plan 9 and it you'll read about this operating system.

155
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:22,168
Scott: By design, it's as secure and as awesome as an operating system can be but at the same time by design It's not really useful or practical.

156
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,293
Scott: Yeah, but you'll see how.

157
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:27,280
Scott: oh look the way this is designed.

158
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:37,240
Scott: security is like super perfect and Linux is designed a lot closer to the way plan 9 is designed than the way windows is designed.

159
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:52,564
Scott: You know, even if Linux is the number one operating system in the universe Sure, a lot more people would be trying to break it But at the same time all the breakages would be fixed really quickly a lot slower a lot faster than the second Tuesday of the month.

160
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:58,000
Rym: Well, I saw someone slashdot made a nice analogy to robbers breaking into houses with security systems.

161
00:11:58,662 --> 00:12:04,419
Rym: They don't break into the houses that have the popular security system they break into the houses that have the weak security system.

162
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:17,820
Rym: Now before I say my thing of the day I'd like to say right now that I don't want to get any guff about this being old

163
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,580
Scott: Because guff guff McGuffin

164
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,698
Rym: McGruff take a bite out of crime

165
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:25,737
Scott: rough

166
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:34,937
Rym: Alright, so I saw an animated gif from my thing of the day the previous I think Monday or Tuesday on Fark And I wondered I wonder what that is.

167
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,529
Rym: Then Thursday, I saw it and I thought oh if it weren't for the fact that I already just recorded the show This would have been my thing of the day.

168
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,020
Rym: I'll make it my thing of the day Monday.

169
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:50,660
Rym: Then it exploded over the internet to the point that someone even posted it in our forums.

170
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,219
Scott: I think two or three people posted in our forums.

171
00:12:53,742 --> 00:13:00,237
Rym: So thus my thing of the day for anyone who hasn't already seen it because goddamn it It was an awesome thing that no one had seen when I saw it.

172
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:25,100
Rym: Okay Okay, so I'm sure you've all heard of Firefox flicks, it's basically that a contest to make ads for Firefox and This was the second place winner of the contest even though it technically broke all the rules of the contest.

173
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:30,480
Rym: Yeah, it probably would have been in first place if it weren't for the fact that it broke almost every rule because it's hilarious.

174
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:33,088
Rym: I can't say any more other than that.

175
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,879
Rym: It is an accurate representation of the web browsers out there.

176
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,318
Scott: I like how opera wasn't represented at all.

177
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,449
Scott: No one cares about opera, that's why it wasn't there.

178
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:45,576
Rym: I'll care a lot more when I get it on my DS.

179
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:49,496
Scott: Yeah, probably Anyway, my thing of the day.

180
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,712
Scott: Well This isn't funny or anything like that as usual.

181
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:56,020
Scott: There's this guy Douglas Rushkoff.

182
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:58,972
Scott: I've known about him for like six years.

183
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,620
Rym: Yeah, in fact you won his contest.

184
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:07,988
Scott: I did win a contest and he sent me like a signed copy of his latest book, which is about Innovation from the inside out.

185
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:09,959
Scott: But anyway, he's an author.

186
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:14,740
Scott: He's an adjunct professor of media something at NYU.

187
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:17,246
Scott: He's on all kinds of documentaries.

188
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,754
Scott: I think he did two different frontline documentaries.

189
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:22,739
Scott: One of them was the very popular merchants of cool.

190
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:39,039
Scott: He basically knows all about marketing and Trends and media and all that sort of stuff and he's really really smart like he's an intellectual for a living like goddamn.

191
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:47,714
Scott: and Currently he's writing this cool comic book called Testament, which is Biblical but also not biblical.

192
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:54,023
Scott: at the same time You should actually if you haven't read it go to the comic store and find issue one I think.

193
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:58,400
Scott: actually I think the trade paperback should be out or the either this month or next month.

194
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,771
Rym: Well speaking as the one who doesn't like comics so much.

195
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:02,720
Rym: I'm probably going to read it because it does look good.

196
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,124
Scott: It's not a superhero comic.

197
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:09,180
Scott: It's like what they do is they'll have like a story in like a somewhat near future.

198
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:11,145
Scott: it's two stories at once.

199
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:22,999
Scott: it's Bible stories and somewhat near future sci-fi stories and He'll show you some kids like rebelling against the evil big brother government and they all have RFID tags in their hands.

200
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:33,158
Scott: and Then he'll show you a story from the Bible like every other page and they match up like the characters match up and what they're doing matches up and it's like.

201
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:37,320
Scott: That's what I have to learn from that story in the Bible.

202
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:41,735
Scott: But this isn't like your bullshit grandma Christian Bible.

203
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:43,040
Scott: This is like the real deal, too.

204
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:48,364
Scott: If you haven't read some What's the word for them?

205
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:51,174
Scott: the books that didn't make it the apocryphal texts?

206
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:54,406
Rym: Yeah apocryphal texts Yeah, like the Gospel of Judah.

207
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,991
Scott: and if you don't know Judas Judas.

208
00:15:56,212 --> 00:16:03,879
Scott: Yeah, and if you don't know actual history as opposed to just Biblical history then a lot of this won't make sense.

209
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:07,545
Scott: however He also wrote this book.

210
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,518
Scott: while he's big you let me just say he's a big Jew like losing Brooklyn.

211
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:15,668
Scott: He's a big Jew And I wasn't really sure how much of a Jew he was.

212
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:18,977
Scott: I read his book called like nothing sacred.

213
00:16:19,037 --> 00:16:25,835
Scott: It was all about Like what being a Jew is really all about and this stuff and it's actually pretty cool.

214
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:30,970
Scott: Like it's not religious It's about Judaism from some other kind of standpoint.

215
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:34,280
Scott: I don't think there's really too many books about religion like that one.

216
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,186
Rym: Yeah, well, this is you coming from mr.

217
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:37,009
Rym: Open source Jugel.

218
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,340
Scott: Yeah, that's what this guy came up with open source Judaism this.

219
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,067
Scott: Anyway today on his blog he came out with this article that was like holy crap And that's my thing of the day.

220
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:49,635
Scott: There's this article on his blog.

221
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:50,580
Rym: It was a good article.

222
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,904
Rym: I gotta say god damn.

223
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:57,240
Scott: So this is a guy remember this guy's wife wrote a book about fun things to do on Hanukkah.

224
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,473
Scott: He's a Jew and the name of this article is faith equals illness.

225
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:05,119
Scott: why I've had it with religious tolerance?

226
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:09,240
Scott: Okay, so let's get into this God game.

227
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:14,108
Scott: There's no goddamn guy You got damn cut the ham.

228
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:15,675
Scott: This is a big juice hang.

229
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:16,378
Scott: There's no God.

230
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:25,387
Scott: Usually if you talk to like Hasid's and like super Jews like really really religious Orthodox Jews They'll like kind of dodge the question.

231
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:27,334
Scott: You'd like there's no God.

232
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:34,932
Scott: He hasn't done any miracles and they'd be like a Mumble mumble tradition mumble mumble.

233
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,943
Scott: My father did it mumble mumble Always with the mumbling.

234
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:40,327
Scott: Yeah, they don't.

235
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:44,900
Scott: I don't think they a lot of them actually believe in like magical craziness.

236
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:48,400
Scott: They just believe in like, you know, their juice stuff.

237
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,293
Scott: I'm sure there are some who believe in magical craziness, but kavala.

238
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:54,259
Scott: I haven't really met so many of them.

239
00:17:55,451 --> 00:18:02,800
Scott: so In this article what he writes about is basically there's no God and we need to use the body.

240
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:10,720
Scott: The Bible should be the weapon of atheists And it's really cool because he talks about it all from his media genius standpoint.

241
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,435
Rym: yeah, like co-opting stories from the Bible and making them relevant so that they can't be seen literally.

242
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:20,711
Rym: but there you have to accept them as the Aphorisms that they are or the metaphors that they are.

243
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:28,260
Scott: Yep, which is really what it's about I mean, I think that's how of a Jew he is is like he won't eat it.

244
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:35,794
Scott: he looks at the passage in the You know in the in the Torah and it says don't cook a calf and its mother's milk.

245
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:39,462
Scott: Well the crazy Jews they stay kosher You know.

246
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:44,300
Scott: and he says, you know, well that obviously just means that you shouldn't add insult to injury.

247
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:51,119
Scott: It's not only does he not add insult to injury But you know, he won't eat like chicken and eggs.

248
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:59,369
Scott: Yeah, just for like symbolism sake, you know to remind him, huh, you know You know not for any.

249
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:01,800
Scott: I'm going to be smitten reason.

250
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:11,171
Scott: You know, at least I remember him saying that once you've said, you know about a thousand times What I say, I know you just said, you know God damn it.

251
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:13,625
Rym: Yeah We were just talking about.

252
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:14,930
Rym: you say like I'm too much.

253
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,436
Scott: Well, I'm done with this thing of the day.

254
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:17,259
Scott: Everyone should read it.

255
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,449
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's interesting.

256
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:31,939
Rym: his main point seems to be that the best way to and he really seems to be kind of bent on getting rid of Christianity and religion in general, but Christianity is To make the Bible relevant to modern life in a very direct way.

257
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:36,320
Scott: Well, his comic book does a real good job of that and so it is his Jew book.

258
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,232
Scott: so if you're interested in that stuff, I recommend you read.

259
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:47,653
Scott: so like other stuff is about business and Selling people stuff and or avoiding being sold stuff to coercion.

260
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:58,640
Rym: Yeah, so I'm like so God damn it All right I'm gonna try to stop saying so um and like do I have to play a buzzer every time you say one of those words?

261
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:00,358
Scott: I don't know if it'll help.

262
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:06,889
Rym: Well, I'll try it for the next few minutes until I either get sick of it or stop noticing Okay, or my headache destroys me and I just stop talking.

263
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:07,531
Scott: All right.

264
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:08,053
Rym: Yeah.

265
00:20:08,134 --> 00:20:09,679
Rym: Anyway, we're talking about hosting today.

266
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:17,819
Rym: Since one people have asked us about it and two we didn't really talk about it in depth at our podcasting panel because it is kind of a technical subject.

267
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:22,539
Scott: Well, the first thing you need to know about hosting is what the hell do you want to do?

268
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:32,752
Rym: Yeah, I mean a lot of people say like oh I have internet hosting but unless you're gonna do something with it You're just pissing money down a well Well, do you want to have a web page?

269
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:34,120
Scott: Do you want to have a blog?

270
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,206
Scott: What kind of blog do you want to have?

271
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:37,492
Scott: Do you want to do a podcast?

272
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,160
Scott: Do you want to have a game server?

273
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:41,720
Scott: Do you want to have a TeamSpeak server?

274
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,010
Scott: maybe some other sort of Server of some kind?

275
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,540
Scott: do you want to use hamachi?

276
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,462
Scott: Do you want?

277
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:48,765
Scott: you know it?

278
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:50,360
Scott: you want to have a jabber server?

279
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,652
Scott: We got to figure out what you're gonna serve before you pick your hosting.

280
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,220
Rym: Yeah, because there are a lot of options.

281
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:59,079
Rym: I mean to contrast it this way the two ends of the spectrum on one end.

282
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:08,540
Rym: You've got like Akamai static content with like Clusters of j-boss web sphere awesome application servers running crazy enterprise stuff.

283
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:09,463
Scott: That's Google.

284
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:12,291
Rym: thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars a second.

285
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:15,240
Rym: or what have you enterprise nuttiness on the other end?

286
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:20,840
Rym: You've got geocities with two megabytes of web space for free or a blog spot where they or live journal.

287
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,743
Scott: You get a free blog.

288
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:22,305
Scott: you get a free live.

289
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,168
Scott: You're my space.

290
00:21:23,188 --> 00:21:24,433
Scott: Yeah my space.

291
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:24,934
Scott: There you go.

292
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:33,100
Rym: I Mean basically there is an option for everyone in every situation And you really have to figure out what you're gonna do and then narrow your choices down.

293
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:37,170
Rym: I mean do you want a web hosting or full-on hosting?

294
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:40,298
Rym: when most people say they have hosting they mean they have web hosting.

295
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:40,739
Rym: mm-hmm.

296
00:21:42,263 --> 00:21:45,984
Scott: most web hosts aren't Really web hosts.

297
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:51,180
Scott: well they are but they're not really giving you a computer or even a fake computer.

298
00:21:51,602 --> 00:22:04,059
Scott: They're giving you some space on an existing web server And they're giving you a web site with which you can manage your space on that web server And you can only put certain things in that space.

299
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:15,630
Scott: It's like if I had set up a whole Linux machine and on that Linux machine I create an HT Docs directory, and I say you can do whatever you want in that directory But you can't go anywhere else in this computer or do anything else.

300
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,296
Rym: Yep, so nothing dynamic.

301
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:18,280
Rym: No scripts nothing.

302
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,236
Scott: Well, they might enable like PHP and MySQL in there and give you a certain Basis.

303
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,659
Rym: Next step up yeah from just web hosting straight-up crap web hosting.

304
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,607
Scott: oh Yes, static web hosting is kind of black.

305
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:36,100
Rym: Yeah, that's what geo cities, and what was that other place back in the day?

306
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:36,623
Scott: That's it.

307
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:37,635
Scott: That's what it used to be.

308
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:38,060
Scott: yeah, yeah.

309
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:42,626
Scott: But then they added you know okay now you can have PHP Which is the same damn thing.

310
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:47,107
Scott: only now you can put a wordpress in there if you want to Which seems to be the wave of the future.

311
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:51,785
Rym: I mean not many people make static web pages anymore except You know small businesses and restaurants.

312
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:52,427
Rym: You don't know better.

313
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:56,080
Scott: Yeah, I don't remember the last time I made a static web page.

314
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:58,248
Rym: I made one for a class.

315
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:00,097
Rym: I took my freshman year at RIT.

316
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:03,795
Scott: Oh, yeah I guess I made some in school when I had to you know.

317
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,342
Rym: the worst thing is about that page I made.

318
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:12,820
Rym: I put it up on my geo cities account because I happen to still have the hosting there And it's still there and now I don't know the password or anything so I can't go get rid of it.

319
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:19,608
Scott: You know what the thing thing is now even if I wanted to do something I've done before we're like a static web page.

320
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:28,530
Scott: like I remember I made a static web page for a project I did in computer graphics - if I was doing that today I wouldn't make a static web page by writing HTML.

321
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,217
Scott: I would install a wiki and then do it.

322
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:34,658
Scott: yep It's just no reason to make a static web page anymore.

323
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:36,668
Scott: But that's a web hosting.

324
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,900
Scott: if all you want is a web page or a blog.

325
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:45,360
Scott: If you're just doing a blog and nothing else you should probably do a blog spot or wordpress.com or one of those things.

326
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:47,988
Scott: Wordpress.com is free is it really?

327
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:48,851
Rym: I believe it is.

328
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:50,015
Scott: I never checked it out.

329
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:50,416
Scott: I don't know.

330
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:51,540
Rym: it's supposed to be pretty cool.

331
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:56,588
Rym: I haven't actually needed to use it since we have hosting Mm-hmm or live journal like you know.

332
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,715
Scott: any of those things would be just fine for you.

333
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:00,039
Scott: Don't bother spending money on it.

334
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,144
Rym: Yes, there's.

335
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:04,579
Rym: basically there's a big line between not spending money and spending money.

336
00:24:05,283 --> 00:24:08,660
Rym: There's also a big line between spending a pittance and actually spending money.

337
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:25,859
Scott: Yeah if you really want to have a blog where you can do all kinds of things and maybe use a Wordpress or moveable type or something like that and you don't want to do a free thing then You're gonna want to pay like five ten bucks a month.

338
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,276
Rym: Yeah, I mean literally for five or ten bucks a month.

339
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:36,646
Rym: you can get Enough bandwidth to cover any amount of slash dotting and a nice host as long as you don't try to post Photoshops to Fark on a regular basis.

340
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:38,652
Scott: Yeah, don't post photoshop stuff are.

341
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:40,899
Rym: those places will probably also do your email for you.

342
00:24:42,243 --> 00:24:46,880
Scott: Now if you want to do something like photo heavy you can use flickr or some such.

343
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:59,468
Scott: I think there's a flickr competitor now actually and You'll have plenty of image hosting and all that stuff and you won't have to pay for a giant Host full of storage space and all that crap.

344
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:01,835
Rym: Yeah, basically you're still just basically in web.

345
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:05,970
Rym: I said basically twice three times Anyway flickr is really cheap.

346
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,735
Scott: flickr is like 25 bucks a year.

347
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:10,084
Rym: But at this point, I mean you're making web pages.

348
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:10,725
Rym: you're making.

349
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:19,979
Rym: it may be dynamic, but it's not heavy content and The price is scaled very very easily toward more and more bandwidth because you're not doing anything fancy.

350
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:27,900
Scott: More and more storage space more and more bandwidth more email addresses more MySQL databases because you're gonna need one per blog.

351
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:29,924
Rym: Yeah, but if you're going this route I mean you'll get up to.

352
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:36,374
Rym: if you get for the forty forty five dollar a month range You've got a crazy amount of bandwidth for most normal activities.

353
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:39,988
Scott: for forty forty five dollars a month You should probably shouldn't be using something.

354
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:42,740
Scott: That's just a web interface to a web page.

355
00:25:43,302 --> 00:25:45,151
Scott: You probably should be getting something more for your money.

356
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:46,960
Rym: Well, it depends on what kind of person you are.

357
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,415
Rym: I mean more for your money also means you have to do more.

358
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:52,092
Rym: That's true Unless you go to the far end of the spectrum.

359
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:52,414
Scott: Yep.

360
00:25:53,078 --> 00:25:53,340
Scott: All right.

361
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,220
Scott: So the next level of hosting is actually it starts to break apart.

362
00:25:58,221 --> 00:25:59,949
Scott: There are three different type.

363
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:04,209
Scott: well, okay, there's managed and Unmanaged hosting.

364
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:05,960
Rym: that's a good dichotomy.

365
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:09,917
Scott: Managed is when someone else takes care of the shit for you.

366
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:13,674
Scott: now I know we were talking about before where you just have a way to better.

367
00:26:13,694 --> 00:26:19,640
Scott: a web interface is Technically managed because they take care of all the software on the computer.

368
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,651
Scott: All you have to worry about is the your web content.

369
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:24,598
Scott: Everything else is taken care of for you.

370
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:33,260
Scott: But you can also get Managed hosting where someone takes care of that stuff for you, but you're not confined to a web interface.

371
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,599
Scott: You're actually getting a computer or a fake computer

372
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:40,747
Rym: Yep, or even to the point where someone takes care of the physical computer But you take care of everything else

373
00:26:40,988 --> 00:26:47,896
Scott: or you just tell someone what to do and they do it for you Like, okay I need you to do this and this and this and this and this and then they do it for you.

374
00:26:48,217 --> 00:27:00,499
Rym: and basically at This point the only difference between the two routes is that the more managed you want it to be the more you want other People to take care of for you and the more the more you're gonna have to pay for each increment of betterness.

375
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:07,635
Scott: Yeah, and if you can't find a hosting solution that already matches what you want and you want something special now You're gonna have to pay even more money.

376
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,900
Scott: Unmanaged is where you have a computer and you do it yourself.

377
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:20,972
Rym: I mean that could be either you have a cable modem and you've got a web server under your desk Mm-hmm all the way up to you co-locate which is where you build a computer.

378
00:27:21,313 --> 00:27:26,153
Rym: you ship it off to someone and they maintain the Computer for you, but you do everything else yourself.

379
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:27,540
Rym: It's your computer completely.

380
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:32,440
Rym: All they do is plug it in to the wall and plug it into the Ethernet and then they don't touch it.

381
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:34,025
Rym: You call them if you want it rebooted.

382
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:34,427
Rym: Yep.

383
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:38,843
Scott: Now if you want a hard rebooted, you can she be able to softly boot it From far away.

384
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:40,270
Rym: Yeah, well hard reboot.

385
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,783
Rym: I mean if you want to reboot it you screwed something up That's for sure.

386
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:44,370
Rym: cuz you're not hosting this on Windows.

387
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:45,053
Scott: No, you're not.

388
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:48,476
Scott: if you're hosting with Windows You got a problem even though a lot of people do.

389
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:48,919
Scott: it's scary.

390
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:51,508
Scott: Yeah, it is scary and they remote desktop in and do stuff.

391
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:55,140
Rym: and uh, though at least worldwide most people use Apache.

392
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:57,540
Scott: Yeah, even they might be running it on Windows.

393
00:27:57,584 --> 00:28:05,992
Scott: Yeah But most people run Apache on Linux or BSD and lamp is number one pretty much Linux Apache MySQL PHP Perl Ruby Python, whatever.

394
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:07,737
Rym: I'm per lamp room a bigger.

395
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:18,400
Scott: Yeah Well, the P technically stands for Python Perl or PHP Usually PHP, but they threw Ruby in there because now a lot of people ride the rails.

396
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:20,088
Rym: Well, we're going off in a lot of direction.

397
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:22,720
Rym: So I guess let's describe exactly what we have for hosting.

398
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:27,200
Rym: All right, you know kind of a nice scenario of what our needs were what we got and then why we upgraded.

399
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:29,205
Scott: All right We have a line ode.

400
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:37,108
Scott: line ode is sort of a special host that fits our needs exactly which is why we have them And they're unlike almost every other host there is.

401
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:37,630
Rym: Yes.

402
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:46,060
Scott: It's an it's a mildly managed solution, which means They don't do anything for me, but they have really good tech support.

403
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:50,620
Scott: So if I have a problem I just say hey and then BAM someone does stuff for me.

404
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:53,431
Rym: Yep to put it in fairly non technical terms.

405
00:28:53,672 --> 00:28:55,460
Rym: They have a big Linux computer.

406
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:56,571
Rym: They have a whole bunch of.

407
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:59,527
Scott: they have a whole bunch of them But there's just one that we care about.

408
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:03,640
Rym: that's really big and they chop it up into a whole bunch of virtual little Linux computers.

409
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:05,500
Scott: You can actually do this at home.

410
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:15,500
Scott: if you have any computer you can install user mode Linux on it and what this allows you to do is Turn any Linux computer into any number of Linux computers.

411
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:25,780
Scott: So even though you have one CPU physically you can actually your network and you know for all intents and purposes You could have a hundred Linux computers if you have enough RAM now.

412
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:32,080
Rym: This is really great for well hosting like we're talking about or for anyone who ever works in the school or teaches.

413
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:34,019
Rym: It's a great way to set up a classroom.

414
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:35,866
Scott: Or for developers.

415
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:41,627
Scott: Yes, if you want to try you want to test something out on a bunch of different Linux's But you only have one computer sitting there.

416
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:42,289
Scott: Perfect.

417
00:29:42,912 --> 00:29:49,233
Rym: Or if you're just a hobbyist and you want to play around with something cool Yeah, so they have a giant computer and it's split up into smaller computers.

418
00:29:49,393 --> 00:29:51,720
Scott: We get one of the smaller computers.

419
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:59,540
Scott: So from our perspective, I have a perfectly normal Linux computer where I'm the root and I'm the master and I can do whatever I want.

420
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:07,259
Scott: it has a lot of bandwidth and It doesn't crash and everything's cool.

421
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:14,220
Rym: Yep, and basically what they do is they they guarantee us we'll get at least this much CPU at any given time.

422
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,755
Rym: We could get more depending on what the box is doing, but we have a guaranteed minimum.

423
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:18,800
Rym: That's how most hostings work.

424
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:22,675
Rym: They'll guarantee you a minimum amount of X. They'll guarantee you at least X bandwidth.

425
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,920
Rym: Mm-hmm that sort of thing.

426
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:25,406
Scott: Yeah, we have a limit of now.

427
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:28,700
Scott: We have a limit of 200 gigabytes per month of transfer.

428
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,489
Rym: Yeah, now it used to have to be bytes.

429
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:30,911
Scott: Yeah.

430
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:31,454
Rym: Yeah.

431
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:33,422
Rym: It used to be half that though We started with.

432
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:35,228
Rym: it was a $40 a month line owed.

433
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:42,013
Scott: Mm-hmm and it meant a hundred and sixty megabytes of RAM And are like six gigs of hard drive space.

434
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:43,199
Scott: I think I'm not too much.

435
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:46,334
Scott: Yeah, if you go to line oh calm we should probably link to it.

436
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:50,931
Scott: Yeah, and you click on Line ODEs, you'll see all the different line ODEs.

437
00:30:50,971 --> 00:30:56,861
Scott: We had the line owed 160. now We have the line owed 320 which is 80 bucks a month and everything's doubled Yep.

438
00:30:56,902 --> 00:31:05,496
Rym: Now we went with the $40 a month one because early on Scott basically just got it for his blog Yep, and that one was just fine and it was perfect.

439
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:06,440
Rym: I mean he used it a lot.

440
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,759
Rym: I saw and I thought it was really cool and I was actually thinking about getting one for me back then.

441
00:31:10,283 --> 00:31:13,039
Rym: I never did because well we started GeekNights Yep.

442
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:17,453
Rym: So we use his and then Emily knew wanted a website and we had plenty of space.

443
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:19,600
Rym: so we hosted it and then we took over.

444
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,673
Rym: Well, we were helping work with this gaming group near as we've talked about them before.

445
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:27,799
Rym: so we started hosting their website And then we ran into a problem.

446
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:35,300
Rym: We didn't run that a hard drive space even levels GeekNights episodes on there Yep, and the CPU was getting pegged, but it wasn't anywhere near the breaking point.

447
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:39,700
Scott: We were starting to run out of bandwidth, but as soon as you got lips and that was no longer a problem.

448
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:40,739
Rym: Yeah, we'll talk about them later.

449
00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:48,480
Scott: But we started to run out of RAM because when you run v hosts with Apache Apache spawns a whole nother set of processes and eats up memory.

450
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:52,220
Rym: Yep, because we only had well it then we only had one but now we had more 60 megabytes.

451
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,400
Rym: But we have X IP addresses and we have X plus Y domains pointing at our place.

452
00:31:58,062 --> 00:32:05,162
Rym: So we have virtual hosting where a one web server is hosting a bunch of different domains and it takes RAM to figure all that Crap out.

453
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:06,346
Scott: Well, kinda.

454
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:09,116
Rym: Yeah, we don't want to go into detail of virtual hosting.

455
00:32:09,397 --> 00:32:10,080
Rym: That's another show.

456
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:11,674
Rym: We'll do the Apache show someday.

457
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:12,279
Scott: All right.

458
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:14,805
Scott: So we ran out of RAM.

459
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:19,660
Scott: I fixed that by making some swap space, but that makes everything go slow and shitty.

460
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,900
Rym: Yeah, you might have noticed that GeekNights site was slowly getting slower over the past several weeks.

461
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:26,667
Scott: Now I have more random.

462
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:27,349
Scott: You know what to do with.

463
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:31,459
Rym: Yep, because it got to the point where we realized alright We've already outgrown our hosting.

464
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:41,517
Rym: Let's pay more for more and the thing is if you have any amount of money when you're want to host something You can you'll never run into a problem because you can always just throw more money at it and it'll get better.

465
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:48,299
Scott: Mm-hmm Now I could have solved the problem by switching from Apache to light HdTPD or whatever you want to call it.

466
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:54,200
Scott: The problem with that is it would have been significantly more downtime to switch to that than to switch to the better line.

467
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,920
Rym: Oh, yeah, and there was more that could have gone wrong that we would have had to then stare at and yell about.

468
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:07,663
Scott: Yeah, I'm currently looking for a way to possibly when the new version of Ubuntu Ubuntu 6 damper Drake when dapper Drake comes out.

469
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:15,450
Scott: I'm gonna look into a way to switch to dapper Drake with light TTP D Without go getting a lot of down.

470
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:15,833
Scott: Yeah,

471
00:33:15,873 --> 00:33:28,060
Rym: because see the way the line ode works now is that basically they have a list of operating system images and Instead of having to do it all manually install We just picked what operating system we want and we say put an image of that on our line ode and it goes

472
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:31,800
Scott: Yep, when you get a line ode at first, it's completely blank.

473
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:37,840
Scott: Then you choose a distribution how much space you want it to take up among other options and it just does it for you.

474
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,759
Scott: And they have a bunch of distributions you can choose from.

475
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:41,351
Rym: Scott pick Gentoo.

476
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:49,962
Rym: for a number of reasons though We're slowly leaning more toward Ubuntu in general as time goes on because I love Gentoo, but it's a pain in the ass Sometimes.

477
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:51,567
Scott: yeah now it's less of a pain in the ass.

478
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:54,677
Scott: I tried out the GUI installer today, but we'll hold off on that.

479
00:33:54,858 --> 00:34:01,840
Scott: Yeah anyway Wait, you can also do is you can split up your hard drive space and install a whole bunch of distributions.

480
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:04,753
Scott: However, you can only use one at a time on line ode.

481
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:06,400
Scott: so you got to pick one.

482
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:08,960
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, you see we don't pay that much.

483
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:14,893
Rym: I mean $80 a month for a lot of power and a lot of space and a lot of bandwidth But we have to do all the work.

484
00:34:15,216 --> 00:34:15,378
Scott: Mm-hmm.

485
00:34:15,982 --> 00:34:22,356
Rym: If you want the sim similar level of hosting, but you don't want to do all that work It'll probably cost you more like a hundred and twenty dollars a month.

486
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:27,520
Rym: Mm-hmm But it's how much is your time worth to you if you don't know anything about Linux?

487
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:32,137
Rym: You're gonna spend a lot of time learning it in short order if you try to do what we just did.

488
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:37,260
Scott: a lot of people In the line ode forums are like well someone take care of my line ode for me and everyone's like why did you get a line?

489
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:39,027
Scott: Ode this isn't for you.

490
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:41,860
Scott: This is for people who want to be able to do anything.

491
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,505
Scott: I mean how many hosts out there?

492
00:34:43,545 --> 00:35:04,940
Scott: Can you go and say hey, I need a jabber server and a teamspeak server and I want to use this weird web server That's not Apache and I want to use this weird email thing and you can't get anyone to do that for you have to get a line ode and set it up yourself because the only way to get those sorts of Services to have your own Linux computer out in the real world with those things on it.

493
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,112
Rym: See because there's the big difference to most people only want web hosting.

494
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,320
Rym: we host our own jabber server front row crew.

495
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:14,578
Rym: That's why if you ever talk to us on jabber, it's Rym or Scott at front row crew calm.

496
00:35:14,718 --> 00:35:16,969
Rym: Mm-hmm We don't host our own email because email.

497
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,160
Scott: we did host our own email, but then it sucked.

498
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:22,110
Scott: So I switched it to using Gmail for hosted.

499
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:27,100
Rym: Yeah, the reasons that we'll talk about in yet another show Wow We're just spawning off Monday shows tonight.

500
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,376
Rym: We sure are hosting your own email can be done and we've done it.

501
00:35:31,918 --> 00:35:32,360
Rym: It sucks.

502
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:36,900
Rym: It really really is not trivial to run an email server in this day and age.

503
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:37,602
Scott: No it is not.

504
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:45,479
Rym: mostly because of all the stuff you have to do to protect yourself from spam and Make sure other people can actually get your messages because they're trying to predict themselves from spam.

505
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:47,771
Scott: and Remember when I talked about virtual hosting.

506
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:55,560
Scott: having more than one domain More than one domain on the same computer in the same IP address for a web server is relatively easy.

507
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:59,599
Scott: More than one domain for the same email server is hell.

508
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,959
Rym: Partly email email as you all may know is very old.

509
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:19,320
Scott: It hasn't changed much in a long long time and there are some email servers You can use these days like qmail that are better alternatives to the old send mail and postfix and I think this XM Also, and they're a little easier.

510
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:22,619
Scott: But there's still a huge pain in the ass to make them do what you want them to do.

511
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:26,720
Rym: Plus your IP address might just be in a range that someone doesn't like and then your email won't work.

512
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,960
Scott: Anyway, yeah, if you use you know, I might send someone an email they won't get it because spam filters.

513
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:36,010
Scott: Yeah, even though I'm not a spammer, you know, they don't know I'm not.

514
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:36,813
Scott: they might whitelist.

515
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:38,037
Rym: so I'll say right now.

516
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:45,057
Rym: I Would highly recommend not as a plug or anything but gmail for domains if you can get a hold of that.

517
00:36:45,198 --> 00:36:46,464
Rym: That is awesome Right.

518
00:36:46,948 --> 00:36:50,480
Scott: So there's also Co-location which you talked about a little bit.

519
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,917
Scott: It's where you send a computer off to the middle of nowhere in terms of the work.

520
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:54,460
Rym: You'll have to do.

521
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,336
Rym: It's mostly the same as what we have to do now with our line out.

522
00:36:57,436 --> 00:36:58,120
Rym: It's your computer.

523
00:36:58,241 --> 00:37:00,151
Scott: Yeah, the difference is is that you make a computer.

524
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:01,760
Scott: you can send any computer you want.

525
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:14,060
Scott: You could go to the new egg and buy a computer that has any amount of CPU hard drive or whatever that you need And then you send it somewhere and what you do is you pay them a monthly fee to keep your computer.

526
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:22,100
Scott: what they give you for that money is Number one a guarantee usually that no one's gonna mess with your computer like physical security.

527
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:25,038
Scott: No one can get in the building unless they're an employee, etc, etc.

528
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:29,380
Scott: To they make sure your computer doesn't fill up with dust.

529
00:37:30,462 --> 00:37:32,954
Scott: They make sure the power doesn't go out because they have generators.

530
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:34,160
Rym: Yeah, they got air conditioning.

531
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:36,269
Rym: They'll watch it if it overheats or beeps at them.

532
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:43,620
Scott: Yep, if your hard drive crashes They'll probably take care of you as long as you pay for a new hard drive all that sort of good stuff.

533
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:46,048
Scott: They give you a network connection.

534
00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:48,839
Scott: That's really fast a lot faster than what you have at home.

535
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,360
Scott: They'll give you a certain amount of bandwidth.

536
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:57,557
Scott: They will make guarantee that it'll be up for a certain percentage of time usually 99 or 100 percent of the time.

537
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:01,331
Scott: Now you and I real IP address.

538
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:02,959
Rym: now co-location itself.

539
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:06,924
Rym: Wanting to do it or not It's if you.

540
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:13,637
Rym: you basically only co-locate if you need a lot of power or you have a specialized thing You need to do because it tends to be more expensive.

541
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:14,904
Scott: Yep It's you I think.

542
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:19,623
Scott: last time it looks like a hundred bucks a month for like some kind of normal co-location But it's usually.

543
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:20,747
Scott: it's usually more plus.

544
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:21,812
Rym: you have to buy the hardware.

545
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,640
Rym: Yeah, which can scale?

546
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,593
Rym: I mean a server can cost between four hundred and forty thousand dollars.

547
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:28,255
Rym: Yep.

548
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:28,697
Rym: Yes.

549
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:32,102
Rym: That was a 40.

550
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:35,974
Rym: Yeah Though the biggest server I've ever actually played with was a six thousand dollar one.

551
00:38:36,034 --> 00:38:37,098
Rym: you little one.

552
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,000
Rym: you means It's really thin it and it goes in a rack little x-series cool thing from IBM.

553
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:46,740
Scott: Yeah, the real reason that co-location is popular is for game servers.

554
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:49,169
Scott: That's like the number one use of co-location.

555
00:38:49,973 --> 00:39:01,940
Scott: if you want to run a counter-strike server If you want to run it behind a cable modem in your house It's not so easy because you either had to expose it to the internet or you to fiddle with routers and your cable modem.

556
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:04,260
Scott: The IP address might change sometimes.

557
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:06,825
Scott: You know, it's not so easy.

558
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:09,574
Rym: You probably got really really little upstream bandwidth.

559
00:39:09,735 --> 00:39:10,698
Scott: Yeah, that's the other thing.

560
00:39:10,738 --> 00:39:11,340
Scott: is it sure?

561
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,498
Scott: You can always just host something in your house to their cable modem or your DSL except email almost any isp.

562
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:17,180
Rym: Oh block email.

563
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:18,144
Scott: Yes, that's true.

564
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:22,360
Scott: The problem with hosting something behind a cable modem in your house?

565
00:39:23,401 --> 00:39:24,265
Scott: There's a few problems.

566
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:28,240
Scott: number one, you don't have a guaranteed static IP address.

567
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:29,685
Scott: It might change.

568
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:31,270
Scott: it usually won't but it might.

569
00:39:31,711 --> 00:39:32,213
Rym: number two.

570
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:34,260
Rym: You don't have a guaranteed internet connection.

571
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:37,069
Scott: Yeah, it might go down your power might go out.

572
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:42,920
Rym: our cable modem has gone down before we're sitting here and I've got the finished Episode and I can't upload it because I have no internet.

573
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:44,345
Scott: Yeah, we can't upload it.

574
00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:47,315
Scott: But at least other people can still weed through our archives.

575
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:48,118
Scott: Hello.

576
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:49,724
Rym: Yay We we.

577
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:50,186
Scott: yeah.

578
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:58,240
Scott: three if you have some sort of router, you know You're it's becomes a huge pain in the ass to have servers in your house behind your router.

579
00:39:58,408 --> 00:40:00,949
Rym: Yes because if you have base you only have one IP address.

580
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:09,959
Rym: if you have an ISP and you're getting cable modem or whatever very few People pay for multiple IP addresses because net network address translation has pretty much obviated that need.

581
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:15,980
Rym: However net often breaks things in ways that you might not realize unless you know how net works.

582
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:23,999
Scott: So if you want to host anything in the real world You need a real IP address like with no net in the way at all.

583
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:36,899
Rym: I still mostly recommend something like a line ode or a managed host as opposed to co-locating Because co-locating involves a lot more work Like we've said many times and really unless you have a specialized need you don't really need that.

584
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:41,880
Rym: Yep, because if you're just running a web server, it doesn't matter what hardware it's on doesn't matter anything.

585
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,010
Rym: You just need to know how fast is how much bandwidth you have.

586
00:40:44,031 --> 00:41:01,220
Scott: Mm-hmm The other reasons that you don't want to host a server inside your house is because cable networks tend to be full of you know worms floating around and IP addresses at hosted locations tend not to have being attacked by worms constantly.

587
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,039
Scott: So if you're doing a Windows host, you don't want to put it in your cable modem area.

588
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:08,372
Rym: Also, you start torrenting and suddenly your server disappears.

589
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:10,239
Scott: Yeah, that's a great one.

590
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:21,410
Scott: Yeah, so you can put something, you know And there are solutions to solve some of the problems of trying to host something from your house Like dynamic DNS and such.

591
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:23,298
Scott: but those things don't work.

592
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:26,019
Scott: that well It's really not worth it and they're a pain in the ass.

593
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:28,431
Rym: I mean and you'll you'll only need the server.

594
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:37,489
Rym: basically like sounds if you're running a game server And if you're running anything other than a game server that needs something specialized like that and a lot of horsepower You're probably doing something big.

595
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:38,433
Rym: that's gonna cost you money.

596
00:41:38,534 --> 00:41:47,180
Scott: Anyway, yeah a lot of people try to do too much with it and They don't want to spend money, but they want to do a lot of stuff.

597
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:49,460
Scott: Well, you're gonna have to spend money if you want to do it.

598
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,551
Scott: Well, you're just gonna do a shitty job if you try to not pay enough money.

599
00:41:52,973 --> 00:42:00,080
Rym: now in regards to colocation and game server Specifically, I know I can't come up with any offhand because I haven't cared about this in at least three years.

600
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:05,454
Rym: But there are many services out there that will co-locate or host for you game servers.

601
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:05,896
Rym: Mm-hmm.

602
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:07,440
Rym: They're actually really cheap.

603
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,372
Scott: yeah, because Hosting a game server, especially for a modern game.

604
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:15,064
Scott: I don't know if you want to make I guess battlefield Do they have servers?

605
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:19,927
Rym: Let's just say a half-life to something something All right a counter-strike source server.

606
00:42:20,388 --> 00:42:23,820
Scott: You kind of need a lot of horsepower for a counter-strike source server.

607
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,395
Rym: Yeah, also actually do need more bandwidth than you think.

608
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:29,850
Scott: yeah Especially if you want to have a lot of players.

609
00:42:29,911 --> 00:42:32,805
Scott: if you want a five player server It doesn't have to be that powerful.

610
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:34,733
Scott: if you want a twenty thirty player server.

611
00:42:34,773 --> 00:42:36,500
Scott: You need a serious freaking computer.

612
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:43,843
Rym: Yeah, that's why you can't really host game servers with normal hosts because our line ode we get what like 50 or 100 megahertz guaranteed On the processor.

613
00:42:43,883 --> 00:42:44,445
Rym: It's not much.

614
00:42:44,506 --> 00:42:45,730
Scott: It's not much now.

615
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:48,400
Scott: We ran the web server doesn't need that much.

616
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:52,079
Rym: We ran a moderately popular counter-strike server when we were at RIT.

617
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:58,806
Rym: It was this crap Oh computer that we threw in the corner plugged into the walls a Pentium 3 450 Let me put it this way.

618
00:42:59,308 --> 00:43:01,218
Rym: RIT had two OC threes and a t3.

619
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:12,040
Rym: We had basically infinite bandwidth and a direct link to internet - If more than six or seven people connected to our server the pings went up to about 700 and then it crashed.

620
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:16,856
Rym: Yeah, and that was counter-strike one running the tiniest map we could find.

621
00:43:16,876 --> 00:43:17,780
Rym: I see world.

622
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:19,710
Scott: I see world was the only map it could handle.

623
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,520
Scott: if we tried to use a bigger map it would crash.

624
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:25,031
Rym: Now I'm gonna give you all out there who may want to host a game server.

625
00:43:25,051 --> 00:43:25,914
Rym: the ultimate secret.

626
00:43:26,215 --> 00:43:31,119
Rym: the best way to host game Servers in the world is to either be in college or know someone in college.

627
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:40,559
Rym: Every good game server you've ever played on is either subsidized by a company or subsidized by a big webcomic or something or It's some guy running it under his desk in college.

628
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:54,696
Scott: an extra computer sitting around in a college is awesome because colleges have crazy bandwidth crazy numbers of players and All you really need to do is get an awesome computer and stick it in the college somewhere and your gold.

629
00:43:55,017 --> 00:44:00,019
Scott: you don't need to buy a co-location You don't need to pay for anything.

630
00:44:00,462 --> 00:44:01,006
Scott: You're all set.

631
00:44:01,126 --> 00:44:08,300
Rym: and the best thing is if you're a geek and you're in college now You'll probably for the rest of your life still know someone who knows someone who's at that college.

632
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:12,619
Rym: You can pass servers down through the generations as long as no one's a fucker.

633
00:44:13,101 --> 00:44:17,940
Rym: Yeah, but if we make that tribe server, I imagine we're gonna have it hosted somewhere on RIT's network.

634
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:19,948
Scott: No, I think we might do it under my desk.

635
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:20,470
Scott: We'll see.

636
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:24,971
Rym: We'll see with the hamachi because hamachi is awesome now Yeah, but I'll bet we could get it at RIT.

637
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:25,876
Scott: Maybe we could.

638
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,998
Scott: that'd be cool All right.

639
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:30,846
Scott: Another thing is dedicated hosting.

640
00:44:30,886 --> 00:44:35,639
Scott: dedicated hosting just means that they give you a computer that's dedicated to you.

641
00:44:36,502 --> 00:44:42,482
Scott: Normally when you get hosting they split up a computer into a bunch of pieces and you get a piece of it Dedicated.

642
00:44:42,522 --> 00:44:44,869
Scott: just means we have a server here.

643
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,818
Scott: If you get dedicated hosting we give you the whole server.

644
00:44:47,878 --> 00:44:48,620
Scott: It's all yours.

645
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:56,176
Scott: you don't have to share it with anyone and It's kind of expensive depending on what cert they usually charge you based on what kind of server.

646
00:44:56,216 --> 00:44:57,019
Scott: they give you like.

647
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:59,930
Scott: if you want They'll say like for this wussy server.

648
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,420
Scott: you pay this much for this awesome crazy server.

649
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,947
Scott: You pay this much for this insane server.

650
00:45:04,987 --> 00:45:07,816
Scott: You pay a fortune for this biggest server.

651
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:08,297
Scott: We've got.

652
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:09,260
Scott: we take your firstborn.

653
00:45:10,063 --> 00:45:11,580
Scott: That's how it works now.

654
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,760
Rym: We said we'd talk about specifically what we have and we talked about lino then went off on a tangent.

655
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:17,809
Rym: But we do have two other hostings.

656
00:45:17,909 --> 00:45:20,360
Rym: We actually use three separate hostings for GeekNights.

657
00:45:21,102 --> 00:45:23,268
Rym: We have the line ode which is basically everything.

658
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:27,140
Rym: It's the websites the databases the jabbers the forums.

659
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:41,386
Rym: everything that is dynamic is on our web server the line ode and this is kind of the same way that most companies do it because you have the dynamic content on your local server and then the Static content is cached or hosted somewhere else.

660
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:41,947
Scott: Mm-hmm.

661
00:45:42,328 --> 00:45:43,872
Rym: We host all of our static content.

662
00:45:44,113 --> 00:45:51,292
Rym: I eat the podcast of eg the podcast on Libsyn which we don't like but I hate to say this.

663
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:53,279
Rym: there are really no competitors in the market right now.

664
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:55,794
Scott: There are some but they're not just as bad.

665
00:45:55,814 --> 00:45:56,297
Scott: They're worse.

666
00:45:56,317 --> 00:45:56,599
Rym: worse.

667
00:45:56,961 --> 00:46:02,840
Rym: I mean, yeah, basically podcasts are gonna present a unique problem to people who want to host.

668
00:46:03,723 --> 00:46:09,468
Scott: Well, it's it's as people want to host different sorts of services out on the internet They need.

669
00:46:09,488 --> 00:46:10,479
Scott: they have different needs.

670
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:17,640
Scott: Gaming people need a lot of CPU and a lot of RAM But they don't really need hard drive space and they don't need so much bandwidth.

671
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:24,600
Rym: They just need high speed pings and such podcasters need something that until recently was only the realm of people with deep pockets.

672
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:30,180
Rym: Yeah, you know lots of bandwidth and you need lots of storage space that will continue to grow at a steady rate forever.

673
00:46:30,342 --> 00:46:35,109
Scott: But you don't really need CPU and you don't really need so much RAM.

674
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:38,019
Scott: You just need storage and bandwidth.

675
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,006
Rym: Yep You don't even need.

676
00:46:39,107 --> 00:46:46,529
Scott: you don't even leave fast You just need it to be bandwidth a lot of data Even if it goes slowly as long as it goes reliably.

677
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:49,940
Rym: now, the problem is podcasting wallets cool and popular.

678
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:55,300
Rym: It hasn't really taken off yet So there's not a huge market for people that cater to podcasters.

679
00:46:55,741 --> 00:47:00,138
Rym: Podcasters have very unique specific needs that are not easily met by the market.

680
00:47:00,398 --> 00:47:00,539
Rym: Mm-hmm.

681
00:47:00,981 --> 00:47:07,020
Scott: So recently people like Libsyn have sprung up to you know, fill this void in the market, but they're not too good at it.

682
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:09,443
Rym: They're definitely wave one Companies.

683
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:18,519
Rym: whenever there's a new trend on the internet or actually in the world in general like a new thing appears There's always the first wave and the first wave are the people who got into the market quick.

684
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,594
Rym: Then there's the second wave of people who get into the market.

685
00:47:21,695 --> 00:47:27,180
Scott: Well, mmm We're gonna ride both waves and we're not gonna stop riding unless we die.

686
00:47:27,648 --> 00:47:36,129
Rym: I mean honestly the only reason we use Libsyn is because they're the only people out there that offer what we need for any amount of money we Would be willing to pay.

687
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,934
Rym: Mm-hmm We would have to pay hundreds of dollars a month to get that much bandwidth from a dedicated real host.

688
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:44,040
Scott: Yeah, it's a problem.

689
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,467
Scott: I mean look at the Libsyn for 80 a month.

690
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:47,571
Scott: We get 200 gig.

691
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,674
Rym: We don't pay 80 a month.

692
00:47:48,935 --> 00:47:49,256
Rym: We pay 20.

693
00:47:49,256 --> 00:47:52,105
Scott: Oh No, I mean for the line ode.

694
00:47:52,386 --> 00:47:55,900
Scott: Yeah, we pay 80 a month for 200 gigabytes of transfer.

695
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:59,148
Scott: We're doing about a hundred gigabytes of transfer right now.

696
00:47:59,529 --> 00:47:59,850
Rym: Yes.

697
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,594
Scott: So if you how long?

698
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:07,395
Rym: and remember that's a hundred gigabytes Accounting the fact that most of our mp3s are not there anymore.

699
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:14,593
Rym: Yeah our Our archives alone generate almost that that in the RSS feed and the forums.

700
00:48:15,195 --> 00:48:16,940
Scott: Yeah, it's not it's not the greatest.

701
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:25,257
Rym: Now Libsyn we're paying what 20 bucks a month and we get infinity bandwidth and infinity storage space.

702
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:33,220
Scott: Well, it's not technically infinity because we can only do is a limit and how much podcasting we can do but we don't break the limit.

703
00:48:33,492 --> 00:48:45,100
Rym: Yep We're pretty much on the limit because I didn't want to pay for the next step up because that's way more than we need For now unless I really up the audio quality to something crazy, which isn't gonna happen till we get new microphones.

704
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:53,353
Scott: So yeah, the last thing you need to know about hosting short of crazy enterprise stuff Which we'll talk about last because you know, no one really cares about that.

705
00:48:53,373 --> 00:48:55,200
Scott: I don't think any company executors listening.

706
00:48:55,352 --> 00:49:03,619
Rym: Yeah if anyone really wants to know about that stuff ask us and we'll do a show on it because I I've worked for IBM and I've done that stuff and I can tell you a lot about it.

707
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:05,809
Scott: last thing really to talk about is domains.

708
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:08,040
Scott: a domain is really just.

709
00:49:08,743 --> 00:49:11,818
Scott: We'll explain this at some point in the future when we talk about how computers work.

710
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:19,220
Rym: Yep It's just a name that turns into an IP address, you know, you type google.com and it goes to 62 dot something something something.

711
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:24,999
Scott: Yep, all domain names are our words that turn into IP addresses by DNS.

712
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,871
Scott: So a little little trivia for everyone out there.

713
00:49:28,353 --> 00:49:29,940
Rym: domain names are actually backwards.

714
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:32,067
Scott: Yeah, it's calm.

715
00:49:32,147 --> 00:49:32,649
Scott: Google.

716
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:35,639
Rym: Well, it's dot dot com dot google dot www.

717
00:49:36,442 --> 00:49:41,919
Scott: Yeah, so you go to calm and then you go down to Google and then under Google you go to ww.

718
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,512
Rym: It's strictly hierarchical.

719
00:49:43,532 --> 00:49:43,935
Rym: Mm-hmm.

720
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,574
Scott: so Anyway, so front row crew calm.

721
00:49:48,996 --> 00:49:53,133
Scott: when you go there The DNS says front row crew calm is this IP address?

722
00:49:53,233 --> 00:49:54,800
Scott: and then you talk to that IP address.

723
00:49:55,181 --> 00:50:03,639
Scott: The only reason we have this system is that people don't have to memorize IP addresses, which would be a nightmare Yes, especially if ipv6 ever happens.

724
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:05,988
Scott: So this is why you need an IP address.

725
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:12,792
Scott: that doesn't change very often because the if you have a changing IP address Then you need dynamic DNS to make the domain names.

726
00:50:12,973 --> 00:50:14,700
Scott: Keep pointing to the correct address.

727
00:50:14,982 --> 00:50:21,839
Rym: However, if you have a dynamic address Then you're probably somewhere with an ISP who doesn't want you hosting things anyway, and they're gonna try to stop you.

728
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:25,920
Scott: Yep, and not only that but dynamic DNS is a little slow.

729
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:33,749
Scott: So there'll be periods of time where your IP address is changed and people are asking Hey, what's the IP address for your domain?

730
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:36,180
Scott: and it gives them the old IP address and it doesn't work.

731
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:48,760
Rym: It's also finicky and more importantly most people who offer DNS hosting don't support DDNS for you because it's a pain in the ass for them and it's really not a real solution.

732
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:56,749
Scott: You should be paying for hosting that's real and we have a real IP address and you're out in the real Internet and not on hidden behind some router.

733
00:50:56,769 --> 00:51:00,400
Rym: now when you when you have a domain you can make infinity things under it.

734
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:03,359
Rym: Oh, yeah, we I mean one eventually the rest of the front row crew.

735
00:51:03,742 --> 00:51:08,125
Rym: We'd like to give them space on front row crew so we could have you know The whale shark dot.

736
00:51:08,145 --> 00:51:10,013
Rym: front row crew calm a dot.

737
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,680
Scott: front row crew calm beat up front record.

738
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:12,880
Scott: I can't see up front record.

739
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:19,340
Rym: And also the way DNS works to go over is really briefly Like we said we have our email hosted with Google even though it's from front row crew.

740
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,800
Rym: The way we do that I think we mentioned this before is the MX record because DNS has different kinds of records.

741
00:51:25,181 --> 00:51:30,499
Rym: There's one kind of record that says alright websites going to front row crew calm go that way.

742
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:35,176
Rym: Email going to front row crew calm go that way and we pointed that one at Gmail.

743
00:51:35,196 --> 00:51:35,658
Scott: Mm-hmm.

744
00:51:36,682 --> 00:51:46,338
Scott: So if anyone tries to send us mail to a certain domain The mail goes to a different IP address than everything else because the MX record is the special mail record.

745
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:48,686
Rym: now Domains are really cheap.

746
00:51:48,846 --> 00:51:51,014
Rym: And if you want to do anything on the internet get one.

747
00:51:51,736 --> 00:51:57,120
Scott: Yeah, I mean Different places have them for different prices for different lengths of time.

748
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,352
Scott: All you have to do is remember renew it if you're gonna use it.

749
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:02,140
Scott: if you're not gonna keep using it don't renew it.

750
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:05,240
Scott: Don't buy too many domains just a waste of money.

751
00:52:06,283 --> 00:52:07,579
Rym: Don't buy a dot biz.

752
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:11,651
Rym: Yeah That was the biggest failed experiment.

753
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:13,680
Rym: no one uses dot biz except shady companies.

754
00:52:14,242 --> 00:52:19,905
Scott: There's really no law that says you have to buy a certain Top level domain.

755
00:52:19,946 --> 00:52:24,540
Scott: like you can run an org with a dot-com and you can do a dot-com under an org.

756
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:28,199
Rym: Yeah, there used to be more strict rules about this, but there's really no way to enforce it.

757
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:31,431
Scott: Yeah, but just try to do whatever you want.

758
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,820
Scott: I mean and do it sounds right do it?

759
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:41,524
Rym: Yeah, I mean we've debated for a while between front row crew dot-com and front row crew dot-net because they both kind of fit What we were planning on doing.

760
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:56,351
Rym: Yeah net pretty net really doesn't mean anything anymore yeah, but generally I use net to mean like a network like a group of people collaborating or a group or a Bunch of services that are all gonna be under one name anything like that.

761
00:52:56,471 --> 00:52:59,140
Scott: Yeah, I have net for my blog just cuz it sounds better.

762
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:01,247
Rym: Yeah, calm down is the most generic.

763
00:53:01,287 --> 00:53:02,331
Rym: calm is just generic.

764
00:53:02,632 --> 00:53:05,121
Scott: Yeah calm is pretty much anything I mean.

765
00:53:05,161 --> 00:53:07,791
Scott: technically it's commercial things but anything could become.

766
00:53:07,832 --> 00:53:08,474
Scott: it doesn't matter.

767
00:53:08,494 --> 00:53:13,630
Rym: or I really You should really only use org if you're some sort of nonprofit.

768
00:53:14,112 --> 00:53:18,124
Scott: Yeah, I mean slash dot has slash dot org So there's really no law.

769
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:22,820
Rym: Oh, yeah, but I mean like a lot of open source projects choose org specifically because of that.

770
00:53:23,422 --> 00:53:25,549
Scott: Yeah, that's a really good example there.

771
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,893
Rym: You can't get dot edu.

772
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,619
Scott: Don't try you can't get that edu.

773
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:29,910
Scott: You can get dot us.

774
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:30,799
Scott: you can get dot TV.

775
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,420
Scott: You should really only get TV if you're gonna do like a video podcast or something like that.

776
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,952
Rym: Yeah, and you should really only get us if you're trying to do some cool web 2.0 thing.

777
00:53:39,454 --> 00:53:40,538
Scott: Yeah, like delicious.

778
00:53:40,758 --> 00:53:44,694
Rym: Yeah I'm thinking about getting nutritious and making some sort of other thing.

779
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:45,498
Scott: recipe site with.

780
00:53:45,538 --> 00:53:50,960
Scott: yeah I'm pretty sure there's something for tag recipes already, but if there is why not anyone does it?

781
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:51,783
Scott: We got it right.

782
00:53:51,823 --> 00:53:52,826
Scott: here is our prior art.

783
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:54,673
Scott: Yeah, bitches and if they've already done it.

784
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:57,965
Rym: Well, they put us um Dot-int you can't get.

785
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:01,879
Scott: no most people don't even know that mil you can't get.

786
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:06,429
Scott: Yeah, you can get other countries other countries.

787
00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:13,820
Scott: what they do is they have like dot CEO dot the country and Then yeah, that's the standard for the whole internet.

788
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:22,239
Rym: But basically because the United States kind of invented the internet and built it in the early days We really kind of ran roughshod over the whole thing.

789
00:54:22,701 --> 00:54:28,220
Rym: So we have all the good comms but some UK company ends up with dot co dot UK instead.

790
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:33,477
Scott: Yeah, but that's cool because then people who live in like Russia know to go to dot.

791
00:54:33,558 --> 00:54:34,240
Scott: are you sites?

792
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,420
Scott: You know and they never go to the stupid US sites.

793
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:40,174
Scott: Yeah, unless you want to unless you want to but I mean this google.co.

794
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,700
Scott: that are you I'm pretty sure there is.

795
00:54:43,502 --> 00:54:48,404
Rym: Now we have the Libsyn and we have the line ode and we also have the feed burner Which is totally free.

796
00:54:48,464 --> 00:54:50,011
Scott: feed burners not really hosting.

797
00:54:50,051 --> 00:54:52,220
Rym: I mean, well, they host our RSS for us.

798
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,710
Scott: Yeah, kind of they don't really host.

799
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:55,120
Scott: It's not a hosting company.

800
00:54:55,160 --> 00:55:04,920
Scott: All they do is you send them an RSS feed and they spruce it up and that way you tell people to go read The feed burner RSS feed which is spruced up properly.

801
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:07,740
Rym: Yeah, meaning we don't have to fiddle with it to make it look right in iTunes.

802
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:09,916
Scott: Yeah but there are any has to do that.

803
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:15,800
Rym: I Mention them only because you should remember that if you want a specific thing like a simple specific thing on the internet.

804
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:19,399
Rym: There's probably a company out there that offers it for free or for very little.

805
00:55:19,762 --> 00:55:32,001
Scott: Yeah, like if all you want is a mailing list You don't need to go get a dedicated server set up a mail server set up Major Domo, whatever the thing is called and then set up a mailing list You can.

806
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:36,760
Scott: there's someone who will give you just a mailing list probably for free maybe with an ad.

807
00:55:37,021 --> 00:55:39,349
Rym: In fact, we use feed blitz for another site.

808
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:39,810
Rym: We run.

809
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:41,557
Scott: Yeah feed blitz I think does it.

810
00:55:41,597 --> 00:55:42,460
Scott: I think Yahoo groups.

811
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,765
Rym: Well, it's actually is kind of cool.

812
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:46,517
Rym: It's just it'll turn an RSS feed into an email list.

813
00:55:46,879 --> 00:55:59,767
Scott: Yep Yeah, if you don't like RSS readers But you like email and you want to get an email every time some website updates and that website has an RSS feed Feed blitz you can set it there.

814
00:55:59,928 --> 00:56:03,400
Scott: There are other services do the same thing, you know feed blitz might not be the best one.

815
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,373
Rym: Yeah, though feed burner says they're gonna offer that.

816
00:56:05,434 --> 00:56:06,862
Rym: I haven't looked into it yet But we might.

817
00:56:07,003 --> 00:56:10,379
Rym: we might offer that on the side under a link somewhere for anyone who really hates RSS.

818
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,313
Scott: Yeah, you'll get an email every time GeekNights update.

819
00:56:13,374 --> 00:56:14,378
Rym: Yeah four days a week.

820
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:19,840
Scott: Great Yeah, or every time yelling every Monday reminding you to go read listen to GeekNights, whatever.

821
00:56:20,382 --> 00:56:27,880
Scott: But yeah, you can basically pick any blog or any podcast in the world and say hey, yeah I want to be emailed every time this guy updates.

822
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:35,960
Scott: It's good for people update infrequently possibly with long posts that are email sized and good for reading an email readers.

823
00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:37,552
Rym: Yeah, maybe you got a blackberry.

824
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:40,007
Scott: Yeah That'll make it cool.

825
00:56:40,349 --> 00:56:40,550
Rym: God.

826
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,260
Rym: I hope my new job doesn't give me a blackberry.

827
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:51,374
Rym: Every job I interviewed at they were like, yeah, we'll give you a blackberry and I was like crap We can blackberry each other.

828
00:56:51,797 --> 00:56:55,243
Scott: great Just we want to do So.

829
00:56:55,263 --> 00:56:56,808
Scott: yeah, that's hosting, you know?

830
00:56:56,888 --> 00:56:59,476
Scott: step one figure out why you want hosting.

831
00:56:59,537 --> 00:57:00,580
Scott: do you even need hosting?

832
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,468
Rym: Yep, step two Google and figure out who offers what you want.

833
00:57:03,749 --> 00:57:06,216
Scott: Yeah get the exactly what you want.

834
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:08,304
Scott: Don't pay for stuff You're not gonna use.

835
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:11,620
Rym: yeah, because it's usually very easy to upgrade in the future.

836
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,400
Rym: If you need more, you can always just throw money at the problem.

837
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:19,992
Rym: but don't throw money at it before you need to throw money at it because then you're just wasting money and Go do it.

838
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,157
Scott: There's something out there for you.

839
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:24,085
Rym: Yeah And don't think that you can.

840
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:26,374
Rym: if you don't know anything about computers you can still do it.

841
00:57:26,414 --> 00:57:28,346
Rym: there are services out there that'll take Care of you.

842
00:57:28,669 --> 00:57:29,579
Rym: you'll have to pay for it.

843
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:34,959
Rym: But don't let your lack of computer knowledge prevent you from doing something on the internet that you think is a good thing to do.

844
00:57:35,582 --> 00:57:40,500
Scott: Yep, the one problem you're gonna run into is there just some things you can't do without knowledge?

845
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,248
Scott: There's nothing you can't do without money.

846
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,580
Scott: There's some things you can't do without knowledge.

847
00:57:45,091 --> 00:57:54,526
Scott: Well, no I guess if you had enough money You could always get like a dedicated server and then pay an IT guy with knowledge to do it and then pay someone else to Make the content.

848
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:58,267
Scott: it becomes prohibitively Expensive to do certain things without money.

849
00:57:58,327 --> 00:58:04,515
Scott: like if you want to develop your own web applications that do something brand new You're gonna need smarts.

850
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:10,480
Scott: But if you just want to make a blog or a podcast you don't need so many smarts to do that.

851
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,129
Scott: There are plenty of websites that'll help you out.

852
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:14,000
Scott: lips in effect can do the whole thing for you.

853
00:58:14,281 --> 00:58:17,077
Rym: Yeah, we don't use them for a number of reasons for all that.

854
00:58:17,238 --> 00:58:19,884
Scott: Yeah So that's all there is to it.

855
00:58:20,245 --> 00:58:20,426
Rym: Yep.

856
00:58:20,787 --> 00:58:21,269
Rym: I'm sorry.

857
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,573
Rym: It might have sounded a little fractured.

858
00:58:23,054 --> 00:58:23,536
Rym: It's Monday.

859
00:58:23,556 --> 00:58:24,158
Rym: What do you expect?

860
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:28,073
Rym: Yeah We got some good stuff coming up in the next couple weeks.

861
00:58:28,777 --> 00:58:29,360
Scott: Oh, we sure do.

862
00:58:29,501 --> 00:58:31,736
Scott: I think for like the next month we should have good stuff.

863
00:58:32,059 --> 00:58:32,581
Rym: Yeah We've got.

864
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:34,225
Rym: I mean, we've got some interviews coming up.

865
00:58:34,306 --> 00:58:36,492
Rym: We've got some some interesting tidbits.

866
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:37,996
Rym: Try not to reveal much.

867
00:58:38,637 --> 00:58:39,540
Scott: got some games.

868
00:58:40,404 --> 00:58:41,538
Scott: We got some funniness.

869
00:58:42,621 --> 00:58:43,243
Scott: It's all good.

870
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:44,548
Rym: Yeah life's been good lately.

871
00:58:44,709 --> 00:58:45,311
Rym: What can we say?

872
00:58:46,014 --> 00:58:47,419
Scott: So go get more people to listen?

873
00:58:48,781 --> 00:58:52,775
Rym: Yeah, hopefully my headache will be gone tomorrow, which is gaming day where we'll talk about a game.

874
00:58:53,377 --> 00:58:54,280
