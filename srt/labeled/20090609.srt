Rym: The more news there is and it's not just on Tuesdays.

00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:38,940
Rym: It's pretty much every day of the week.

00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:46,600
Scott: Well, they had the stupid D conference They had the stupid e3 and they had the stupid Steve Jobs all in like the same two weeks.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,427
Scott: You know I think from now on right.

11
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,996
Scott: I mean basically last year.

12
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:56,960
Scott: at this time There was also a Steve Jobs, and it's the year before right you know cuz that's pretty much.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,920
Scott: I think the iPhone is always gonna get updated in June every year forever.

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,491
Rym: Yeah, but look the iPhone got updated right after the pre.

15
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:03,476
Rym: Hey we had e3.

16
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:07,700
Rym: yeah I know right you think did you see all those other cell phones that were announced?

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,565
Scott: You know what I realized today.

18
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,991
Scott: Verizon doesn't have shit for phone.

19
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:12,035
Rym: Yeah, they don't.

20
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:25,740
Rym: I Was actually t-mobiles got the g1 sprint got pre AT&T got iPhone Verizon got dick for dick And I mean I was actually looking to check when my contract like that day the contract my expire expires and all that stuff.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,220
Rym: But yeah, they said hey upgrade your phone get a new contract, and they didn't have any good phones.

22
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:34,490
Rym: No, I could get some like normal crap phone.

23
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,219
Scott: Yeah, it's a Tuesday episode technically speaking.

24
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,965
Rym: yes We should talk about vid games.

25
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:40,953
Scott: you want to talk about any e3 whatnots.

26
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:41,936
Rym: I don't know.

27
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:46,020
Rym: we should well probably Have to do a show about several of these announcements.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,425
Rym: I mean there's so much to talk about.

29
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:51,919
Rym: we haven't even talked about how NS is available NS - we can pre-order it.

30
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:52,927
Scott: Oh, man, we didn't.

31
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:57,193
Rym: yeah, no shit That is the day that I did not expect to come as soon as it did.

32
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:58,258
Rym: yeah that came out of no.

33
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:04,121
Scott: and again There are people out there of Duke Nukem forever pre-orders Plus.

34
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:08,574
Rym: there's the the new Zelda game and the other new Zelda game that was hinted at.

35
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,600
Scott: oh, yeah, that doesn't count.

36
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:19,452
Rym: Well they basically by all they had to do is release that screenshot, and it wasn't a Miyamoto who said yeah There's a reason he doesn't have a sword and everyone lost their shit.

37
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:21,240
Scott: How about that Metroid game?

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,993
Rym: Yeah, I'm actually looking forward to that.

39
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:27,589
Scott: about that For Mario for swords Mario game that could.

40
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,923
Rym: the thing is that could be what the Mario remake on the DS Should have been.

41
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,856
Scott: I like how they're acting like four swords doesn't exist right.

42
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:41,940
Scott: It's like they make this game Basically four swords, but they're acting like they just came up with this brilliant idea.

43
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:45,918
Rym: I know I mean four swords in my opinion was one of the better games Nintendo ever put out.

44
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,784
Scott: yeah Well, I think what happened?

45
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:55,537
Scott: is it just so few people like actually played a lot of those things from that era Except for us the era when Miyamoto was sad.

46
00:02:55,557 --> 00:03:05,620
Scott: yeah So they can like they can pass off that shit again, and I think however I think that the platforming aspect will make that game a lot more frustrating.

47
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,649
Scott: I mean it was bad enough in Zelda that you'd have people setting each other on fire And you know I'm talking about the not on purpose times.

48
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:16,262
Scott: You know the on purpose times are perfectly okay, but in this game Record.

49
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,327
Scott: yeah in this game.

50
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:24,980
Scott: There's gonna be plenty of on purpose pushing the other guy in a hole But I think there's gonna be even more accidental pushing the guy in the hole, and it's good.

51
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,959
Scott: It's not gonna be good.

52
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:27,444
Rym: Well it depends on this.

53
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:29,289
Scott: you have four skilled players.

54
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:37,900
Rym: if they were if it were set up such that four people could go Say the worlds were the little boards were like Mario 3 boards, and you can all go in different directions.

55
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,807
Scott: Yeah, I think it keeps you on the same screen.

56
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:41,554
Rym: see that that's from what I've seen.

57
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:47,299
Rym: well four swords was good with the same Screen in the splitting you could also make a really good game if people can just go off.

58
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,507
Scott: Yeah, they really need to do that.

59
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:49,648
Scott: No.

60
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:53,280
Scott: I don't think there is a game like that where they should really make a DS game.

61
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,989
Scott: Everyone can just go off on the same map.

62
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,458
Scott: you know and not all the thing is like.

63
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:00,120
Scott: you know.

64
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Scott: There are some games like that where you can just go off, but it's usually bad to go off.

65
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:11,701
Scott: You know you need like two people in the same place to like navigate a puzzle or something like that You know.

66
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:15,820
Scott: so you want to stick together or force and also fight the bad guys at the same time to kill them quick.

67
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:22,220
Rym: Four swords rewards you if you run off by giving you jammies But it hurts everybody because you can't actually go forward.

68
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,791
Scott: Well it also doesn't let you.

69
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:27,520
Scott: it lets you run off But doesn't let you run up very far keeps you in the same place.

70
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:34,180
Scott: I'm talking about a game where it's like let's say it's a big Final Fantasy dungeon even a roguelike and you can just run off.

71
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:36,158
Scott: It's basically a local MMO.

72
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:39,128
Scott: It loads the whole instance and everyone.

73
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:42,738
Scott: not only should you go off, but you can.

74
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,744
Scott: well Not only can but should you.

75
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:52,386
Rym: Nintendo barely scratched the surface with those the idea of that of you having your own screen with hidden Information and they did.

76
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:55,334
Scott: the DS sort of does that without any help.

77
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,939
Rym: one games do it.

78
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:01,148
Scott: well I mean advance wars with fog of war.

79
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:05,859
Rym: advance wars is probably the best multiplayer game on the DS.

80
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,405
Rym: still Yeah, I mean look most games.

81
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,513
Scott: They have multiplayer, but it's joke multi.

82
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:14,080
Rym: It's always some weekend like Castlevania You know beat the other guys time.

83
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,262
Scott: Yeah They always have.

84
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:17,870
Scott: why do they feel the needs like put in this joke multi.

85
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:25,580
Scott: well actually the the puzzle games Tetris puyo pop those Have good player Mario Kart if it didn't have snaking you know those sorts.

86
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:27,347
Scott: But you know why?

87
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:28,050
Rym: I can tell you why.

88
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,440
Rym: because then they can put that multiplayer logo on the box.

89
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:36,287
Scott: Yeah, and grab the games have like some sort of joke ass Not even worth playing multiplayer.

90
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,212
Scott: listen if this is a part of your game.

91
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:39,716
Scott: That's not even worth playing.

92
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:43,979
Scott: don't put it in there I know someone's gonna say oh might as well right it can't hurt.

93
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,648
Scott: Yeah, kind of can hurt.

94
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,471
Scott: It's just there's.

95
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:49,640
Scott: there's spending time and money making that shit.

96
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:50,939
Scott: They really made another level.

97
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:59,059
Rym: They really like like I. the thing that bothered me is playing the old like Chrono Trigger remake And they basically added an entire crappy version of Pokemon to the game.

98
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,580
Rym: Whoa you can go you can go into this area and raise monsters and fight them like why?

99
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,407
Scott: But does it have any connection to the actual game part?

100
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:07,391
Rym: don't think so.

101
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:08,274
Scott: so it's just this.

102
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:10,020
Scott: tacked on on the side thing.

103
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:15,860
Scott: I think you can basically Chrono Trigger plus bad Pokemon on the same cartridge like Mario and Duck Hunt on the same cartridge.

104
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,179
Rym: I think you can get some sort of item.

105
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,642
Rym: I don't know.

106
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:22,540
Rym: I walked in there to see what it was and I walked right back out and take that game facts.

107
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,905
Rym: Anyway, we're gonna cut short.

108
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:27,832
Rym: We're not gonna talk about all the e3 stuff.

109
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:29,900
Rym: We'll let that ferment for a while.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,218
Rym: Maybe we'll do an extra Tuesday episode next week to catch up, but tonight We have an interview with two game developers Emily and Alex who work for muse games and live down the street.

111
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,060
Rym: Yeah It's the Emily and Alex of the front row crew who also happen to be game developers.

112
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:52,240
Rym: Yes for real game developers - not like you know Not like a lot of people are game developers.

113
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:56,300
Scott: Yeah, right like what was that guy who made the game for the GBA?

114
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,593
Rym: Nintendo didn't accept that guy while he was crazy.

115
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:05,527
Rym: He gets a lot of points for determination If you consider those points.

116
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:06,591
Rym: well boy, I didn't.

117
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:07,956
Rym: what are you gonna redeem him for?

118
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,060
Scott: another negative point?

119
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,660
Scott: There's a space for crazy space boy space boys.

120
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,620
Scott: You need a billion to add up to one regular point.

121
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:21,659
Rym: but Emily and Alex work for muse games a small game studio and there they've made a game elementia that you will link to.

122
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:25,460
Rym: that you can play and We're going to interview them shortly.

123
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:29,236
Rym: We already did and now we're just gonna play the audio from the interview.

124
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:30,160
Rym: We conducted last night.

125
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:41,500
Rym: Well, thanks to all sorts of microphone shenanigans There are somehow four microphones plugged into this mixer board here of varying quality shape and size.

126
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,062
Rym: We've got.

127
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:46,881
Rym: we've got Rym and Scott as always on the SM 57 or 58.

128
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:47,926
Scott: No, they're not 58.

129
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,810
Scott: We need to get some of those.

130
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,252
Rym: Yeah, we do.

131
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,140
Emily: and here's Emily on the headset.

132
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:55,768
Scott: That's the Radio Shack.

133
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:57,118
Scott: piece of shit is the technical term.

134
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,524
Rym: Famous microphone.

135
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,950
Rym: someday we will sell that on eBay.

136
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,838
Rym: That was the first GeekNights microphone.

137
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,903
Scott: Yeah That'd be great.

138
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:10,700
Scott: imagine if like, you know say I don't know some famous radio guy was like.

139
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,518
Scott: He made a radio show and he was like a kid in High school and he had the microphone that he used like man.

140
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,300
Scott: What if I go I could go find my like fisher-prize tape recorder somewhere?

141
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,491
Emily: I think that every little kid had that fisher-prize tape recorder.

142
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:26,818
Emily: because I've got all these, you know, they're.

143
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,719
Emily: they're kind of preschool audio dramas.

144
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:34,440
Emily: Many of them concern like the alternate adventures of Peter Pan.

145
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:36,645
Guest: They're like really really weird.

146
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:37,589
Emily: or or like.

147
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,359
Emily: there's this one where we're having a trial for a rabbit and like it was.

148
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:51,900
Emily: it was actually kind of funny because it showed that even as like six-year-olds we had a Pretty good grasp of how the legal system worked like there was a prosecutor and a defense.

149
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:56,547
Emily: Did you chew on this thing?

150
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,192
Scott: we had ones that were.

151
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:02,006
Scott: they were like little books and then they came with the tape that Went with the book as he would.

152
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:05,922
Scott: you sort of listen to the tape while you read the book at the same time and you Get the sound effects.

153
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:09,252
Scott: They would read to you or whatever, but then on the reverse sides.

154
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,817
Scott: It was always record whatever you want.

155
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:20,460
Emily: I Still think the best thing was my mom dug out a whole bunch of tapes I had made when I was a little kid and there was one where it was just I would turn the tape recorder.

156
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,028
Emily: I carried it with me everywhere.

157
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:24,540
Emily: And so I turned the tape recorder on at random times.

158
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:28,655
Emily: And so you just get these conversations from like 20 years ago.

159
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:29,860
Emily: It was kind of wild.

160
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:37,780
Emily: There was one where my mom was trying to get my toddler sister To get in the car and go to the clothing shop and my sister was being really uncooperative.

161
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:40,670
Emily: So it's just this exchange, you know, it was.

162
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:41,835
Emily: it was kind of funny.

163
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,260
Emily: It's really nostalgic to listen.

164
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:49,479
Rym: I have an hour of screaming and horrible noises mixed together in a loop that I then would Randomly just play.

165
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:54,993
Guest: You were so much fun for your parents party guests.

166
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:58,964
Scott: Remember the retro arcade.

167
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:04,020
Scott: guys said that he had like a vinyl audio recording of his parents wedding and he restored it for them.

168
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,070
Emily: Oh, yeah, that's kind of awesome man.

169
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:06,613
Guest: It is cool.

170
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:07,940
Emily: That guy is cool.

171
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,769
Rym: But the main reason as we mentioned

172
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:11,210
Emily: in the beginning

173
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:39,140
Rym: that we have these extra microphones here is that we actually you know Independently of Emily and Alex being friends of ours and such they are both Game designers working in the actual gaming industry making And pretty much we get the question either email to us or in the forums at least once an hour Asking us how to be a game developer and what it's really like or something to that effect.

174
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:48,488
Emily: Yeah, I remember a thread in the forums There was like a kid in high school who was like, this is what I want to pursue as my career You know, does anybody have any advice?

175
00:10:48,588 --> 00:11:06,465
Emily: and actually there were quite a few people like Mancun, for example who actually have worked in the game industry and Immediately started giving this kid advice and warnings and like sometimes you'll have to work on pretty princess pony games Even if you

176
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:09,645
Scott: don't want to you know Really seems like in a few.

177
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:19,200
Scott: there's like a few jobs that like in any sort of geek area, you know There's always like some job that someone wants like all the skater kids want to like be Tony Hawk for a living.

178
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:19,602
Emily: Yeah,

179
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:23,080
Scott: all the gamer kids want to be like, you know, John Carmack for a living

180
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,937
Emily: Programmers want to work at Google or animators want to work in

181
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:34,820
Guest: Pixar Literally every programmer to whom I ever heard the question asked at RIT would say yeah, I want to make video games.

182
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:36,680
Guest: Yeah, like literally everyone.

183
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:41,111
Rym: So I guess the first question is how did you two?

184
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:44,000
Rym: well first, what do you both actually do?

185
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,120
Rym: I mean, I can't explain to my grandma or my mom or anyone what I actually do for a living.

186
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,189
Rym: So what do you actually do?

187
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:50,419
Emily: Well, I'll go first.

188
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:53,760
Emily: It was it's actually kind of a small studio.

189
00:11:54,001 --> 00:12:00,040
Emily: So I actually my work is a lot more varied than it probably would be if I worked for a big studio like EA.

190
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:02,764
Emily: I do Concept.

191
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:12,000
Emily: my my official title is a virtual world character designer And so I do Basically all the art assets that go into the games.

192
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:19,400
Emily: I do the character design, you know start out with Photoshop paintings and model sheets and then I go into 3d modeling.

193
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:21,711
Emily: I texture and sometimes rig.

194
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:26,130
Emily: I had some help with rigging Characters from an intern we had.

195
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,937
Emily: he's still a very good friend of mine.

196
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:42,625
Emily: But So modeling rigging, you know, basically the the 3d character creation from start to finish You know, I do a lot of the animation as well Design environments I do.

197
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:58,859
Emily: I guess one of my main things lately is I've just been producing a ton of textures for For this virtual chat that we do and so it's like, you know fashions for avatars and Like 20 t-shirts a day or something, you know.

198
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,427
Emily: So, what about you Alex?

199
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:01,889
Emily: What do you do?

200
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,180
Guest: Well, I program things.

201
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:08,676
Guest: I would like to be more specific than that, but I really can't be I don't know.

202
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:13,632
Guest: you said It's a small studio and we all kind of have to wear a bunch of hats.

203
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:17,205
Guest: Yeah, so I do graphical effects I do game logic.

204
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,775
Guest: I do low-level networking stuff.

205
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:22,800
Guest: I occasionally dabble in the website.

206
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,613
Rym: Yeah, well, what's your actual job title?

207
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:28,960
Rym: because I remembered being something cool.

208
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,540
Guest: Yeah, I am a virtual world architect, which I agree sounds really cool.

209
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:51,556
Emily: It's basically I do almost a little bit of almost everything design the framework of every single game we do and You you also do some artistically oriented programming like you do our shader development and particle simulations and stuff like that.

210
00:13:51,576 --> 00:14:00,195
Emily: actually many of the the programming Things that you do have a have a visual effect in the final product.

211
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:06,498
Guest: Yeah, I mean it's Effects programming which is I guess the the best I can come up with for an actual field.

212
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:14,119
Guest: for that it falls into this weird line that kind of straddles the the pure engineering and pure artistic ends of things.

213
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:15,686
Guest: I'll agree.

214
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:16,979
Guest: It's one of the more fun parts of my job.

215
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:21,620
Rym: So to really illustrate I mean, you know people always ask how do you get into the gaming industry?

216
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,080
Rym: How did both of you get into the gaming industry?

217
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Rym: Because it's it seems like it's an impossible task for the majority of people who have ever lived in this earth.

218
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:47,698
Emily: Well, I think part of the thing is it seems very daunting because a lot of people they try to go for the big industry, you know the big houses and Competitions very fierce for like say EA or or other like valve or something like that.

219
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,717
Emily: But with with me I I'm working for a startup.

220
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:59,359
Emily: So I Ended up getting into it by a kind of lucky lucky chance here.

221
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:12,540
Emily: I did a character design contest right when so sauce the parent company of muse games was starting out and That was back my senior year of college and I remember spending one night in my dorm room.

222
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:21,060
Emily: I think it was like on my birthday or something was the deadline Drawing these two characters for this design contest and I got second place.

223
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:31,138
Emily: I didn't win but in return they kept in contact with me and I come in and test their web applications for their travel website.

224
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:37,098
Emily: and so I got to learn, you know, all the different people in the office and we became kind of friends.

225
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:45,140
Emily: and Then one day a few months later I found out that they were looking for a character designer and I was just graduating.

226
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,863
Emily: It was like a month before I graduated.

227
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:49,368
Emily: So I ran and I was like me me seriously.

228
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,129
Emily: That's what I do.

229
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:57,059
Emily: and It worked out and they looked at my portfolio and decided that I was good enough and they hired me.

230
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:00,346
Emily: And Alex you were kind of.

231
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:07,455
Emily: that was kind of funny for you too because This is a lesson in the importance of connections.

232
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:21,625
Guest: I got hired Networking and I the guy who had previously done my job had quit suddenly for personal reasons of his own yeah, and They needed a graphics program.

233
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:30,800
Guest: and I happened to be a guy who'd done graphics programming at least a little bit Even though I wasn't doing it professionally at the time, but that was like your master's was in.

234
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:33,506
Guest: It's what I had done in school.

235
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:40,486
Guest: I had done, you know computer science, but I kind of focused on graphics Graphics programming broadly.

236
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,512
Rym: Well, plus you did that RIT special.

237
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,780
Rym: Hey stick around a little longer and you get a masters.

238
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:46,517
Guest: Yes, that means you have to call me master.

239
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:48,586
Guest: I'm hoping you do that.

240
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:50,716
Rym: Did you get to wear that special hat to a graduation?

241
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:51,540
Scott: I have a hood.

242
00:16:55,462 --> 00:17:05,326
Guest: Yes, I was in the right place at the right time the right place being looking for a job in the New York area the right time being when the Social sauce needed a graphics program.

243
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:06,652
Emily: Oh, man, did we ever?

244
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,560
Emily: we were like you totally saved us.

245
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:09,403
Emily: I was.

246
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:11,371
Emily: I was very worried for about a week.

247
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,780
Emily: They're like, oh my god, our main programmers gone.

248
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,563
Emily: What are we gonna do?

249
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:30,259
Guest: and as a result because I'm working for tiny little startup studio My first job in the games industry is as the Lee basically the lead developer of a studio Which is really not something it's possible to do any other way.

250
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:36,381
Guest: This is normally an industry where as I understand it you have to do a lot of grunt work before you get to do cool Stuff.

251
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:38,329
Scott: Yeah along those lines.

252
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:43,240
Scott: I mean, I think that a lot of the punk kids out there, you know They want to be make video games.

253
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:48,660
Scott: I you know I get the feeling that a lot of them think that they just are sort of gonna get the Miyamoto job where you say what?

254
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,178
Scott: The game is gonna be and then it somehow it is.

255
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:57,869
Scott: So what like, you know, you told us what you do on a broad level, but like, you know What do you do on like, you know the micro level.

256
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,498
Scott: you go into work and is it?

257
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,263
Scott: you know It's not.

258
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:01,878
Scott: you're not playing video games all day.

259
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:08,519
Emily: Can I say something real quick?

260
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:18,500
Emily: That one of the things is good about Going the indie route and working for a smaller studio is we kind of do this a tour thing where?

261
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,320
Emily: Every game that we've created so far seems to be somebody's pet project.

262
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:37,133
Emily: Like the game that we're going to be talking about today was basically Alex's creation and like sledding was Brian's and The the next game is Austin's.

263
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,945
Emily: so it's like having such a small team.

264
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:51,244
Emily: you do get to have a lot more creative freedom and input into the Types of games that are being created but on a day-to-day basis, I'm It's late to any other.

265
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,515
Guest: it's like any other programming job.

266
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:54,640
Guest: I have a list of bugs.

267
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,644
Guest: I go and fix them.

268
00:18:55,945 --> 00:19:07,365
Guest: or I have a list list of features that I need to add to the software or I have you know the vague plan for a new piece of software that I'm in the process of either Writing out or prototyping

269
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:15,451
Emily: and I guess it's the same for me where it's not every day that I'm doing like You know original characters.

270
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:23,480
Emily: It seems like a lot of the time I'll just go into work and make like 50 chairs or something like that or or texture a bunch of crates.

271
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:42,772
Emily: I remember having the conversation about making license plates and like 90% of Any computer job, it's just making the license plates In some ways in the ways in the ways of the geek I guess.

272
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:45,480
Rym: so I guess very specifically like just you know.

273
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,427
Rym: Let's get us up the notch a little bit.

274
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:50,560
Rym: Let's let's engage on the high level as we talked about last week.

275
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,162
Rym: Yeah, what?

276
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:54,514
Rym: what specific skills or I guess classes from school?

277
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,340
Rym: Would you say came the most in handy?

278
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,493
Scott: Or previous experiences also?

279
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:06,012
Guest: well I Work in mostly in C sharp, which is a language.

280
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,120
Guest: I had never used before I came to this job.

281
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:15,427
Guest: But at my previous job, I had to learn Python Perl and PHP which were also languages I had never used from until that job.

282
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:26,491
Guest: So it's especially if you're a programmer you have to be flexible you have to be able to pick up a new language as Needed pretty much the right tool for the right job.

283
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:27,073
Scott: Yeah, I can.

284
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:29,040
Scott: I can definitely echo that times a billion.

285
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,360
Scott: I mean, I've never had a job where I you know, I mean, you know, I worked at James.

286
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:42,213
Scott: I had to do Ruby which I didn't really do before so much and I mean I've done Python sorta But now is the first time I'm doing it for super reels.

287
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:43,660
Scott: times a hundred, you know.

288
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:52,460
Scott: And the job I got right out of college I did PHP and MySQL which I had sorta kind of maybe done in one class kind of not really

289
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:59,518
Emily: Well, I think one of the most important things once you get out of college is that a lot of the times you're going to Be teaching yourself.

290
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:14,740
Emily: So make sure you go around the internet and find any available resources and tutorials and everything I feel like I've gotten a lot better at for example modeling and texturing since I graduated college.

291
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:22,600
Emily: I mean most important classes I think for a character designer would definitely be like fine arts and figure drawing.

292
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:28,671
Emily: You've got to be able to look at something and then Be able to create a character from it.

293
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,880
Emily: You've got to have a good grasp of anatomy.

294
00:21:31,762 --> 00:21:34,330
Emily: Whether or not you do 3d or 2d.

295
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,092
Emily: It doesn't matter.

296
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:44,240
Emily: knowing the human form is going to be Absolutely essential to anybody doing video game art Also?

297
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:49,880
Emily: Yeah basic if you're if you're 3d artists just take a lot of 3d classes, you know.

298
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,623
Emily: Make sure you get a very well-rounded education and don't just focus on one Aspect.

299
00:21:55,663 --> 00:22:02,508
Emily: do modeling rigging, you know programming too can be very useful For for rigging.

300
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:10,799
Rym: so it's interesting how in this whole discussion The the topic of designing games from a game a pure game perspective hasn't come up at all.

301
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,700
Guest: We haven't gotten there yet.

302
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:19,662
Rym: It seems like most kids who want to get into the gaming industry always think oh I got a great idea for a game Are they?

303
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:22,778
Rym: but it how much of the job is actually?

304
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,313
Rym: Designing games from the game side versus implementing.

305
00:22:27,494 --> 00:22:28,920
Rym: This is a loaded question, obviously.

306
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:37,539
Guest: Well, well, the design is a relatively small part of it on the one hand But that's not to say it's a small thing.

307
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:52,540
Guest: if you're gonna actually Specify a design at the level the design of a game at a level that you could then go and implement it From an artistic or a programming standpoint you need to get really frighteningly specific.

308
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:57,767
Guest: I have somewhere Probably about a 10 or 15 page document.

309
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:00,614
Guest: That is the original design doc for elementa.

310
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:02,038
Emily: It's completely different.

311
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:07,920
Guest: Yeah The game that it came out of it is actually very different from what that document originally specified.

312
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:12,779
Guest: Because The thing that is most important, of course is that the game should be fun.

313
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,050
Guest: Your game is not fun.

314
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:18,686
Rym: change it, you know A lot of professional game developers could learn that.

315
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:23,860
Emily: but we went through so many stages of play testing and got so much feedback.

316
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,690
Emily: I think you developed the original game within like three weeks or something.

317
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,076
Emily: It was like inside of a month, wasn't it?

318
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:36,632
Guest: And then Engine which Going to go into game development get a proper engine.

319
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:42,260
Guest: because if you want to go into engine programming That is a fine and good thing But that is not game development and do not fool yourself.

320
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:51,100
Guest: But if you're going to go into game development and write your own engine It's not worth the effort 90% of the time the love guy did it, but he's crazy.

321
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:56,659
Guest: It's not what I would recommend as your first project.

322
00:23:56,881 --> 00:24:03,929
Scott: Well, I think the thing about making engines for most of the people who've made engines is that you know You have to sort of if you're gonna make an engine.

323
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:15,180
Scott: it's sort of in the service of a game, you know It's like they didn't just make the quake engine and they make quake later, you know They made the quake engine for quake because there was no engine available that suited their needs or is even close.

324
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:23,305
Scott: Yeah I mean In the making of a you need to make an actual game on the engine while you're making the engine so that you actually make The engine usable.

325
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:24,632
Rym: well, even half-life.

326
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,140
Rym: I mean half-life itself.

327
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,023
Rym: They took the quake engine that already existed and they modified it to suit their own very heavily though But they did.

328
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,572
Rym: they took a basic engine and modified.

329
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:34,979
Rym: they didn't just write anything from scratch.

330
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:46,057
Emily: Well, I feel like especially for all you aspiring bedroom coders out there you'll just save yourself a lot of work and produce probably a better-looking product.

331
00:24:46,338 --> 00:25:01,939
Guest: if you Go for an engine that's already created It will save you a huge amount of time and headaches over very very minor things and as Emily suggested you'll be able to get a playable prototype of your game in a week or two.

332
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:10,100
Guest: and That first playable prototype is really important because that's gonna tell you whether or not your your basic concept is actually worth playing.

333
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:13,451
Guest: All the design docs in the world will only take you.

334
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:24,326
Guest: so far the design doc and you know Analysis of the game from a mathematical theoretical standpoint can help you in the right direction But it won't itself.

335
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:25,751
Guest: let you synthesize a fun game.

336
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,899
Guest: that theory doesn't seem to be developed yet.

337
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:35,266
Scott: Well, I mean, did you have any like, you know, you you would think right on paper at least that you know The designing of a fun game, you know.

338
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:40,160
Scott: without you know, the trial and error method we would be somewhere in the psychology department.

339
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,392
Scott: Did you have any like, you know psychology peoples on board?

340
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:48,146
Guest: not as such no That's a hobbyist.

341
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:51,078
Emily: I mean you've thought a lot about the psychology of games.

342
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:51,299
Emily: Yes

343
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:08,800
Guest: The most directly psychological like the thing I can think of that came into the design was actually in terms of visual design because that is what's gonna Turn people off or on to your game before they even have a chance to experience your clever mechanics, whatever they are.

344
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,240
Scott: Do judge by the book by the cover despite the saying as to not do so.

345
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:19,000
Emily: It was kind of weird because I remember we we ended up doing the visual stuff.

346
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,092
Emily: It actually wasn't a very taxing project.

347
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:42,684
Emily: as far as art design went, you know Because there wasn't a lot of 3d modeling It was it was mostly just these 2d character cards these illustrations that I had to do And I remember I I presented these mood boards to show like what I was kind of going for and I remember our boss Had some reservations.

348
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:46,860
Emily: he said, you know, I don't want this to be really heavy and dark and medieval looking.

349
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:54,394
Emily: I you know, even though it's got this alchemy theme this and mythology going on I want it to be approachable much more hardcore.

350
00:26:54,495 --> 00:27:02,080
Guest: in the original It's kind of lightens over time, which is fine because it wasn't necessary to the game.

351
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:10,048
Emily: he wanted it to be more approachable and less, you know hard fantasy looking and I remember over that weekend.

352
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:11,973
Emily: I did a series of five sketches.

353
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:24,194
Emily: I did like a digital painting and a medieval kind of like illuminated manuscript looking and I did one that looked kind of Disney esque.

354
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:35,160
Emily: and then I did this cut paper design and It was funny because even though it was one of the simplest Illustrations it seemed like everybody really like that one.

355
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:44,620
Emily: It almost ended up with kind of this children's book Theme to it and I think that definitely changed the atmosphere of the game quite a bit.

356
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:53,479
Guest: It was I still feel a very striking design and it's not one that You really see in any other game at least none that I can think of.

357
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,930
Scott: Yeah, I mean you see you see it in South Park and such.

358
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,340
Scott: but you know, you don't see that in video games too often.

359
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:03,680
Guest: Yeah, I feel like there's some recent game that has this kind of like ripped cut paper theme going.

360
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:08,508
Guest: It's in a slightly different direction than ours The blurst one the paper moon.

361
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,616
Emily: They did all with sharpies and stuff.

362
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:18,580
Guest: But yeah the Anyway, it was a distinctive style and I think the distinctive style is gonna help from the that initial appeal point of view.

363
00:28:18,902 --> 00:28:21,220
Guest: It's it gets eyes on it, which is always helpful.

364
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:29,080
Emily: So do you want to talk about a little bit how the actual game mechanics changed over time?

365
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:37,700
Scott: Yeah, it was Like how the game works, you know, like just the basic, you know, don't need we don't need the rule book.

366
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,103
Rym: We just need tell us the concept you started with and then we'll go from there through the evolutions All right.

367
00:28:43,163 --> 00:28:56,200
Guest: Well as you may guess from the name of the game elementia It's about elements the before classical elements earth air fire water And it's a 2d kind of tile laying strategy game.

368
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:07,149
Guest: the The original idea of the game, I think it actually on some level came out of a conversation I had with you two guys over Japanese food.

369
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:12,063
Emily: I remember that time we were at the neko But it was.

370
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:34,899
Guest: have these four elements have each of them provide a different benefits and then using them in concert is the strategy you have to develop and On top of that was developed to this Sort of cyclical element beating another rather than the usual Well more usual two opposites each of which, you know can strike hard at the other.

371
00:29:35,462 --> 00:29:38,795
Guest: It's everything beats one thing and is beaten by one other thing.

372
00:29:38,835 --> 00:29:44,053
Guest: in this perfect circle If you've played the fire emblem games, it's very similar to the weapon triangles in there.

373
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,020
Scott: Yeah, they axe the spear in the sword.

374
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:52,360
Guest: Yeah, this case it's fire beats air air beats earth earth beats water water beats fire or crystal warriors.

375
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:54,271
Scott: Well, that's what is the.

376
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:55,216
Scott: so it cross ways.

377
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:58,388
Guest: it's just even Yep, so you have that.

378
00:29:58,508 --> 00:30:03,294
Guest: you have the the tile laying which is There are two purposes to it.

379
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:09,590
Guest: There's the Arrange things so that Elements are adjacent to one another and provide the bonuses you need.

380
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:19,199
Guest: and there's the chain everything up to make attacks with since The way we do you do the attacks in this game the more elements of the same color it passes through the stronger it is.

381
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:35,819
Guest: So what we were trying to do is to create this tension between you want to stretch out in this long twisty chain but that's inherently fragile and you want to bunch things up to Produce all the adjacency benefits and protect each other and heal each other and all that good stuff.

382
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:42,879
Rym: So did you start considering multiplayer from the start or single-player only or what was your thinking along those lines?

383
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,693
Guest: multiplayer was in mind from the start.

384
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:52,020
Guest: the Original idea for the multiplayer was this crazy shifting alliances thing.

385
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:57,172
Guest: I'll say right now that a lot of stuff from elementia.

386
00:30:57,412 --> 00:30:59,279
Guest: I cribbed from one board game or another.

387
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:07,375
Guest: The tile laying was originally basically straight out of T&E to take her son Euphrates Although it's kind of drifted since then.

388
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:19,279
Guest: This alliance mechanic that it has also drifted from since then was inspired by Dune and it ended up Actually managing the alliances was going to be too complicated for what it would have gotten us.

389
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:21,009
Guest: So we stuck to a strict.

390
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:22,960
Guest: it's either a versus game or a co-op game.

391
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:31,099
Emily: there's actually a fair number of maps that you developed and Do you want to talk about like the way the placing the elements?

392
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:43,074
Emily: changed because for a while it was a draft and there were like cards and And then there was a point system and there originally it was.

393
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:50,719
Guest: it was this card draw thing and that ended up being Basically wasn't adding anything anymore.

394
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:56,480
Guest: So again, if a mechanic isn't helping get rid of it, you don't need the extra complexity.

395
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:00,969
Guest: I mean the later development of this game was a battle with removing extra complexity.

396
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:03,590
Emily: Yeah It's just keep it simple.

397
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:15,805
Guest: Keep it simple and that was It's a very distinct thing between Four games which is on some level how I started thinking of this and a video game, which is what it actually is In that a board game.

398
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:19,076
Guest: usually when you play it you sit down and there is someone there to teach you.

399
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:27,348
Guest: that is Kind of a big crutch that board games can lean on and they can have a lot more Complexity and still appeal to a lot of people.

400
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:41,326
Guest: where for a video game has to be entirely self-taught Even if you're playing multiplayer You're usually not playing multiplayer with someone who's gonna walk you through every action and teach you all the mechanics Even when they're willing to.

401
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:45,380
Guest: they're not in the same room and it's really hard to do that over text chat or even voice chat.

402
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:46,972
Guest: If you they can't point at the screen.

403
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,060
Scott: Yeah, that's so true.

404
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,393
Scott: I mean like how many times do I get like a flash game?

405
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:53,679
Scott: and even if there are instructions I like maybe look at the controls and that's it.

406
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:01,896
Scott: If I look at anything at all before I just click play and start playing and it's such a short attention span with a video Game you just you know, if you can't figure it out right away.

407
00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:02,520
Scott: It's like that's it.

408
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,082
Scott: You're done.

409
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:07,320
Guest: people aren't willing to read instructions and they aren't willing to figure it out for themselves.

410
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:11,680
Rym: It's it's it's catch-22, but it's weird because as much in the games as I am I'm like that.

411
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,465
Rym: I mean I sit down.

412
00:33:12,505 --> 00:33:14,156
Rym: I'm a wreck the dead by getting any as game.

413
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:17,032
Rym: I take it home I put it straight in and I'd start the game.

414
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:17,978
Rym: I hit a. see what ate.

415
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:18,930
Rym: it hit B C would beat.

416
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,500
Rym: it hit them both.

417
00:33:19,762 --> 00:33:22,119
Rym: I just try every button combination and then I'd go and that was it.

418
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,800
Scott: Yeah, it's really hard on the computer though.

419
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,483
Scott: Cuz you have a keyboard with so many buttons that if you're gonna use it at all It's.

420
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:28,877
Scott: you know, it's whoa.

421
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:36,940
Guest: You're of a mindset that you'll sit down to do that to a game and you'll actually do that until you figure it out.

422
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:38,909
Emily: Some people just go.

423
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,440
Emily: Oh, this is complicated.

424
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,173
Guest: Yeah, say it's complicated.

425
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,704
Guest: I don't want to bother Mmm, is that?

426
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:50,123
Scott: did you see that a lot in the testing like, you know, you'd get someone to play the game and they be Like I was too complicated.

427
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:50,624
Scott: What do I do?

428
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:55,800
Guest: Yeah, the the UI went through numerous revisions as a result of all that.

429
00:33:56,381 --> 00:34:04,083
Emily: That was probably the biggest challenge in getting the game ready for release was getting the UI so it wasn't confusing.

430
00:34:04,123 --> 00:34:11,773
Emily: people seemed like no matter what we did or how we designed the The wheel at the bottom showing the the progression of the elements.

431
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,540
Emily: Everybody was like, what does this do?

432
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,608
Emily: I don't understand this game at all.

433
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:18,020
Guest: Yeah, so there were a lot of iterations.

434
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:30,937
Guest: There was again complexity being stripped out where it wasn't absolutely strictly necessary and in the end I think we actually came up with something pretty cool and All this iteration and forcing us to think about it did help the final product.

435
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,251
Scott: Yeah I mean that's something I've noticed a lot.

436
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:52,800
Scott: actually is that you know When I when I look at indie games and when I look at professionally made games It seems like the indie games have these really good ideas But they really struggle on like a lot of basic things like controls and interface and these sorts of things and the professional games Often might not have much interesting going on in terms of the actual game.

437
00:34:52,860 --> 00:35:03,795
Scott: But the interface is always correct and the you know, the the controls always are work and are well calibrated and all that That's what you get when you can hire a dedicated interface designer.

438
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:09,677
Emily: Yeah, seriously We did have an intern that you'd let him test stuff.

439
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:13,507
Guest: and yes You you need testing.

440
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:25,480
Guest: in any software development in game development You need more and additional kinds of testing than I think in any other kind With possible exception of life-or-death stuff like air traffic control.

441
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:32,120
Guest: Yeah, seriously because in addition to testing the the pure functionality of it You need to test that very subjective.

442
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:33,986
Guest: Is it fun thing?

443
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:38,040
Guest: and you need to test that on people who have never played the game before?

444
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,636
Guest: Which becomes increasingly hard to find as you you run through your list of friends who are willing to test and

445
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:57,240
Emily: all sorts of people Like, you know, you want to try to get different Demographics to test it and see okay So this is big with board gamers, but does this 30 year old lawyer lady like to play?

446
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:22,370
Emily: No, but we do have Once once a month we have this open open studio night where it's it's the muse games game night where you can Come and eat free pizza and test the games so that that actually helped a little bit in getting a variety of people to Just give us their basic reactions on the

447
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:23,955
Guest: huge help.

448
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:27,775
Scott: Yeah The cost of the pizza.

449
00:36:27,795 --> 00:36:30,663
Guest: Oh, yes totally so.

450
00:36:30,683 --> 00:36:41,296
Rym: did you ever get frustrated showing someone a game and trying to not explain things to them to see if they figure it Out on their own and seeing them clearly not figuring it out, even though it's so obvious to you.

451
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:54,468
Guest: Yes But I was helped in this in that Before we ran the first of these game nights I'd been flipping through various Game design documents from other companies.

452
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,857
Guest: valve in particular is as a huge resource of stuff.

453
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:58,780
Guest: They just put online.

454
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:01,608
Guest: It's their old GDC presentations and that sort of thing.

455
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:18,880
Guest: One of which was about the importance of hands-off testing where You the designer don't sit there and walk walk someone through the game you stand back and you watch their reaction See when they flounder and see when they're really picking it up quick and stuff like that.

456
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:29,431
Emily: And it's hard because it's like, you know having played the game so many times and being so familiar You at least I end up kind of lacking a perspective.

457
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:40,720
Emily: So I just want to be like no no see that's how you do it But you just got to force yourself to let them Figure it out on their own and acknowledge if they can't figure it out on your own you're doing something wrong.

458
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,099
Emily: Yep, that's what you're gonna work on tomorrow.

459
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:47,172
Scott: Games do exist that people figure out it on their own.

460
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:50,578
Scott: And so if yours isn't then that's Hopefully it is now.

461
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:53,038
Scott: So does your game have any sort of?

462
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,584
Scott: Musics going on.

463
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,359
Emily: Oh, I love the musics.

464
00:37:58,082 --> 00:38:20,417
Emily: It was an acquaintance of our marketing guy and the guy who designed the website Austin and There was this composer that he knew and we sent him some demo tracks and One of the things my my vote was I was like I want something kind of ephemeral kind of like that end of time from Chrono Trigger.

465
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:21,380
Emily: and he wrote back.

466
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,190
Emily: He was like, I love Chrono Trigger.

467
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,100
Emily: He's actually a pretty big video gamer.

468
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:28,515
Guest: So and that's when we knew we had probably found the right guy.

469
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:41,720
Emily: Yeah His tracks turned out really nice Nicely, I don't know how you describe it kind of Bells and piano and it's not too overpowering.

470
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:50,432
Guest: it's it's not like a grandiose score, but I mean this is It's kind of a contemplative game and I think the music reinforces that.

471
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:53,079
Scott: yeah, you have sound effects like, you know.

472
00:38:56,107 --> 00:38:58,700
Scott: Yep, did you make them or did you just buy them or what?

473
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:14,566
Guest: Yeah, we have a sound library that was minimally massaged by me wearing a sound designer hat And I I created the particle effects to go along with With those sound effects.

474
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:17,980
Emily: So like if you click on the fire attack, there'll be like flames.

475
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,920
Scott: And it was so that you see you're listening to the sound and then you had to make an animation that match.

476
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:25,238
Scott: It was opposed to vice-versa opposite, wasn't it?

477
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:30,572
Guest: We really needed sound in this thing.

478
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:32,838
Emily: Yeah, I think the sound adds a lot.

479
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:33,600
Emily: I mean people.

480
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:35,124
Emily: You know when?

481
00:39:35,846 --> 00:39:45,050
Emily: when you're not actually creating a game I guess people don't realize how much Just simple sound effects will add to the overall product.

482
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:58,440
Scott: Well, I mean think about that Terminator game for the NES that soundtrack Yeah, where everything was the same exact noise No matter what happens you shoot you get hit Or Atari.

483
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:03,633
Scott: Yeah, so do you guys have like a?

484
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:05,960
Scott: you know, you're you're not a big game studio.

485
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,089
Scott: You're probably not selling this thing for like $50, right?

486
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,513
Scott: So is there a?

487
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:12,980
Scott: what is the money-making strategies you got there?

488
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,884
Emily: It's the game.

489
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:20,260
Emily: the core game itself is is free playable to anybody who has the unity plug-in.

490
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:22,739
Scott: Is that also free?

491
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,540
Emily: Unity plug-in is completely free and I'd actually recommend you download it.

492
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:36,359
Emily: I mean, I know a lot of the people listening to the show are probably really leery of installing any you know plugins on their computer.

493
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:47,711
Emily: But there's this browser plug-in that works with the game engine that we use unity 3d and allows you for 3d game content in your browser.

494
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,580
Guest: and it's not just us we're using it.

495
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,917
Guest: There are a few big companies who are using it and there are a million little indie game developers using it.

496
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:03,869
Guest: So So far as I know there's nothing else that is actually really doing this right now in terms of Letting you put 3d stuff in a web page.

497
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,620
Guest: There's the the nascent Google Mozilla efforts.

498
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:13,516
Guest: But yeah, even those there may be 3d, but they're not a full game Proprietary - I mean there's like the quick live.

499
00:41:13,576 --> 00:41:21,380
Guest: Yeah Application an instant action, which is just a wrapper that lets it install any application it wants.

500
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:31,040
Emily: It's basically like the 3d version of flash is I guess the easiest way I've heard it explained.

501
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:45,196
Emily: But so you install the plug-in you go to our site and the games there to play But we will release further maps and other characters through the store.

502
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:53,980
Emily: and The part of the thing with elementia is it's got this mythological theme and there's all these.

503
00:41:54,181 --> 00:42:02,066
Emily: You know the Sun the moon Saturn you know Jupiter very very Greek mythology oriented.

504
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:13,200
Emily: and I guess Half of the characters as of yet are free and the other half they have different powers different special abilities.

505
00:42:13,762 --> 00:42:30,136
Guest: you can buy them for a for a pittance in the news game store and Because I know someone out there is gonna ask this because it's the question I would ask No, you do not get the inherently better characters by spending money on them About this.

506
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:34,172
Guest: The additional characters do provide you with other options.

507
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:35,636
Guest: They're all.

508
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:36,980
Guest: the characters are asymmetrical.

509
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:46,365
Guest: They provide for very different play styles But we were very careful to try to not make any of them strictly better than the others because the people who spend money are Not just gonna win.

510
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:49,240
Guest: No, we've seen how that ruins.

511
00:42:52,002 --> 00:43:02,295
Scott: So it's not the Korean model it's just sort of a you know People who are big fans and want to want to do something Having a free demo and then you pay for the full version.

512
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:07,392
Emily: Yeah, and That one of the things I think is really good about the game is one.

513
00:43:07,472 --> 00:43:07,612
Emily: it's.

514
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:10,560
Emily: it's two-player multiplayer four-player multiplayer.

515
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:12,813
Emily: It's either versus or cooperative.

516
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:16,658
Emily: It's you know, it can be played totally solitaire.

517
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:32,097
Emily: and The thing with the maps is you made a whole bunch of different variations where the Plague the enemy grows in different ways and there's different obstacles and stuff like that.

518
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:34,758
Emily: lay out of the board changes with each new map.

519
00:43:35,962 --> 00:43:37,353
Guest: Provide some replayability there.

520
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:44,382
Rym: Yeah That stuff really reminds me of the miasma from Crystal Chronicles Wasn't it?

521
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:48,640
Guest: based in part on the fungi from Nausicaa Valley of the Wind?

522
00:43:49,242 --> 00:43:56,140
Emily: Because it used to be called putrefaction before it was called the plague and I I thought the sea of corruption.

523
00:43:56,361 --> 00:44:04,718
Emily: So I spent like I don't know three or four hours Just digging up pictures of mushrooms and that black mold in Michigan and Nausicaa.

524
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:14,820
Emily: I looked at all these weird plants from Nausicaa and So the the gloppiness of the of the enemy is it's a little a bit based on that.

525
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:16,185
Emily: It's kind of moldy.

526
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,494
Scott: So you said it was a. it was a browser plug-in.

527
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,000
Scott: So does it work in all the browsers?

528
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:22,089
Scott: I mean like Safari 4 just came out today.

529
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:22,370
Scott: I don't know.

530
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:23,656
Scott: probably doesn't work in that right.

531
00:44:23,676 --> 00:44:24,178
Guest: I'm not sure.

532
00:44:24,701 --> 00:44:29,560
Guest: Safari 4 it does work in Safari doesn't work in Safari 4. it probably will shortly.

533
00:44:30,924 --> 00:44:38,452
Guest: It works in IE Mozilla Chrome Safari on Windows and Mac.

534
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:43,149
Guest: there is no Linux version Unfortunately, there is demand for this and they've.

535
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,940
Guest: the developers of unity have said that they're looking into it, but they haven't gotten to it yet.

536
00:44:48,142 --> 00:44:51,520
Emily: They better do my facial morph targets before they do that.

537
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:59,449
Scott: It works, you know, like, you know me but I mean like when you make a website, you know You always have to worry about all the different browsers.

538
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,840
Scott: Does this have a problem with that or no?

539
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:06,020
Guest: The unity itself is actually very good about cross browser compatibility.

540
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:15,919
Guest: There are occasional wrinkles with the cross operating system compatibility because it uses different Layers to talk to the hardware, but even those are relatively minor.

541
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:19,700
Scott: I'd say you know You wouldn't like recommend one browser over the other for playing it.

542
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,080
Scott: You would just say we use whichever one is the one you're using.

543
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:24,993
Guest: Sadly, I have to generally.

544
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:35,468
Guest: yes, sadly I have to make a ding against Firefox and that Firefox apparently has terrible memory management on some level And it causes weird garbage collector hiccups.

545
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:36,692
Guest: There's nothing you can't play through.

546
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:38,338
Scott: So that's Firefox 3 you're talking about.

547
00:45:38,378 --> 00:45:39,000
Guest: That is Firefox.

548
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:41,327
Scott: I'd be interested in Firefox three and a half.

549
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:42,310
Scott: Have you tested that out?

550
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:43,053
Guest: I have not.

551
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:43,594
Guest: I'll have to do that.

552
00:45:43,614 --> 00:45:44,256
Scott: That'd be interesting.

553
00:45:44,296 --> 00:45:47,678
Scott: Yeah That's enough technical whatnots.

554
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:51,689
Emily: So you guys have played the game right.

555
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,840
Scott: I played it a few times a little bit.

556
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:04,944
Scott: I played it while I was having beer and pizza after work Of course, I think I've only played the actual finished game though, like once or twice, you know, I played the Unfinished game a few other times.

557
00:46:05,024 --> 00:46:07,469
Emily: I remember you were very obsessed with the old man.

558
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:08,230
Emily: You're like old man.

559
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:10,240
Scott: Well, I like the characters.

560
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:16,578
Guest: Lemon party You brought it up, not us.

561
00:46:18,183 --> 00:46:18,971
Scott: Rym brought it up.

562
00:46:20,045 --> 00:46:20,859
Rym: Lemon party.

563
00:46:22,623 --> 00:46:24,518
Emily: This is not good promotional material.

564
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,386
Scott: The characters are all you know, it's like.

565
00:46:26,707 --> 00:46:27,650
Scott: it's like on the one hand.

566
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:35,080
Scott: They're like all you know, sort of, you know stylistic But they're also sort of cute and quirky in a way, you know, it's like they do all have a lot of personnel.

567
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:46,640
Scott: Yeah, it's like when I. it's like whenever I play a video game with characters, you know, like a fighting game or whatever You know, it's like there's always some characters obviously better or worse, right?

568
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,854
Scott: But I try not to pick based on that.

569
00:46:48,874 --> 00:46:51,348
Scott: It's like when I play a board game I always pick green because I like green.

570
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:58,700
Scott: so when I play a video game and there's a character selection I try to pick a character that looks, you know, you know as something I like, you know.

571
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:06,473
Scott: So if I'm playing Street Fighter, I'll pick you know M. Bison because he I just I just like his look better than I like The other people, you know.

572
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:12,960
Scott: or I'll pick You know Siegfried in Soulcalibur because he's a big knight with a giant sword and all the other people are sort of.

573
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:20,339
Scott: I'm not interested in them, you know, so You know in in this game There's sort of like this quirky old man with a cane and he's sort of like whoo.

574
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:29,620
Scott: His head's like leaning over a little bit and he's sort of like, you know He reminds me of sort of like, you know, like the sort of silly old man in a lot of animes and whatnot.

575
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:38,349
Emily: I should do you a little animation of him just to make you happy like take After Effects and be like I was that he's not animated in the actual game.

576
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,652
Emily: No, he's not animated.

577
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:41,036
Emily: I didn't have time to do that.

578
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:45,433
Scott: I was making t-shirts You plan to like, you know, I mean, you know not.

579
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:47,060
Scott: the game is like done and out, right?

580
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,840
Scott: Yes, it is So are you going to continue though to you know iterate upon it or are you just gonna you know?

581
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,146
Scott: Leave it be and move on.

582
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:58,037
Guest: Um, well, that's partly gonna depend on What feedback we get about it?

583
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,859
Guest: I don't think any of the other games we've released have ever actually been finished So I see no reason to expect that for this one.

584
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:16,980
Emily: But on the other hand, part of the reason why I didn't animate the characters on the character cards was that we do have two other games in the pipeline.

585
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,020
Emily: This is really only our second full game release.

586
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,939
Emily: I mean, we have that virtual world chat, but that's not really a game per se.

587
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:32,000
Guest: Although in fairness, a lot of the technology we developed for that fed into all our other games.

588
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,600
Emily: Yeah, definitely.

589
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:36,940
Emily: And actually, it had the most art asset creation for it.

590
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,339
Emily: But so this is like our second game game after Extreme Sledding.

591
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,200
Emily: And there's two other games in the pipeline.

592
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,760
Emily: Can you tell us anything about them, or is that still a proprietary secret?

593
00:48:48,047 --> 00:48:48,540
Emily: What do you think?

594
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:51,660
Emily: Can I say the buzzword for the one?

595
00:48:52,022 --> 00:48:54,439
Guest: I think we can say one magical word about one of them.

596
00:48:54,882 --> 00:48:55,696
Emily: Air pirates.

597
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,440
Rym: That's two words.

598
00:48:57,722 --> 00:48:57,908
Guest: Oh, no.

599
00:49:00,364 --> 00:49:01,659
Emily: Air pirates and airships.

600
00:49:01,944 --> 00:49:02,840
Emily: Be prepared.

601
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:13,140
Rym: So having actually brought this game to completion from the beginning as kind of people just getting into the gaming industry, what did you learn?

602
00:49:15,403 --> 00:49:18,800
Rym: Like, what would you have done differently from the start making this game?

603
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:27,137
Guest: Well, one, I have a much greater grasp of how much complexity you can actually expect people to pick up on, especially for a little browser game.

604
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,400
Guest: And it has taught me to rein in my ambitions for the future.

605
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,240
Emily: And I don't know.

606
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:44,680
Emily: As far as I'm concerned, like I said, it was a very simple game as far as art asset creation.

607
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:52,660
Emily: But I think one thing that really left an impression on me is, you know, GUI design is incredibly important.

608
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:59,360
Emily: And I should definitely start earlier in the design process with developing a GUI.

609
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:08,660
Emily: And like each iteration, each change in gameplay, you've got to adjust your ideas of the layout of the interface.

610
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:14,520
Emily: And I guess the interface, we really started working on that way late in the game.

611
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,380
Emily: We had like a very standard boxes thing--.

612
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,098
Guest: It was crappy with the [INAUDIBLE] --for a long time, yeah.

613
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:41,760
Emily: So I think every time Alex changes a gameplay element, I think I'll also have to look at it, and along with our other design people like Austin, and kind of brainstorm about how can we make this particular iteration very intuitive and playable.

614
00:50:42,361 --> 00:50:49,138
Guest: If you're one of those aspiring game developers out there, I have a piece of very, I think, cogent advice for you.

615
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:58,439
Guest: Inevitably, if you're a wannabe game developer, you have in mind some huge sprawling game.

616
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:11,539
Guest: Statistically, from what I've seen, it's very likely to be an RPG, but it doesn't have to be, with a million really cool and novel mechanics, and really great graphics, and a really awesome story, and wonderful music.

617
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:13,020
Guest: And that's great.

618
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,119
Guest: And that's a great thing to shoot for, but you have to understand you're not going to make it on your first try.

619
00:51:18,506 --> 00:51:27,999
Guest: It's kind of like-- You have to be willing to focus on the things that are really important about the game, the most important elements, whatever they are.

620
00:51:28,441 --> 00:51:29,278
Guest: Make those work.

621
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:33,860
Guest: And if you can add stuff that works with them rather than against them, great.

622
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,740
Guest: But if you can't, leave it small and perfect.

623
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,700
Emily: Well, it's kind of like how I was when I first entered film school.

624
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,780
Emily: It's like I really wanted to do this big epic feature thing.

625
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:53,700
Emily: And then I realized, no, just concentrate on getting a damn good three minutes worth of footage, and then start to increase your ambition.

626
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:57,440
Emily: But yeah, start small and start solid.

627
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:04,580
Emily: Come up with something really well thought out, and then you can start to work your way up the ladder.

628
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:09,879
Guest: Do not allow yourself the luxury of saying, I know this, and this, and this.

629
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:10,687
Guest: This one part.

630
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:12,540
Guest: I'm kind of fuzzy on, but I'll figure it out later.

631
00:52:12,889 --> 00:52:12,995
Guest: No.

632
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,059
Guest: Sit down and figure that part out now.

633
00:52:15,905 --> 00:52:16,880
Scott: Or else it'd be Dwarf Fortress.

634
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:17,931
Emily: I don't know.

635
00:52:18,862 --> 00:52:20,799
Guest: I don't think that's where Dwarf Fortress has issues.

636
00:52:21,322 --> 00:52:22,019
Guest: I don't think so.

637
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:23,216
Guest: It has issues.

638
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:23,974
Guest: I won't deny.

639
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:27,880
Scott: I just wanted to rip on Dwarf Fortress.

640
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,400
Emily: So you too, review time.

641
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,659
Emily: Do you like the game, yes or no?

642
00:52:33,242 --> 00:52:33,474
Emily: YN?

643
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,031
Scott: I don't know if I've played it enough to figure out if I like it or not.

644
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,299
Scott: I got to play it a few more times.

645
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,760
Scott: Because definitely when I played it most recently, it was way different from what I remembered.

646
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,640
Rym: Because we were playing like that beta beta version on the right.

647
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,180
Emily: I remember I was playing the beta beta version version.

648
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,259
Emily: We were all sitting in front of the TV that I played the beta beta version.

649
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:57,520
Scott: And it seemed kind of because like I would put out a whole bunch of balls and they would die really slowly.

650
00:52:57,701 --> 00:53:00,980
Scott: And it was sort of like it was that, you know, it was like I was.

651
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:02,600
Scott: I couldn't tell if I was winning or losing.

652
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:05,359
Scott: And, you know, I could put so much stuff out.

653
00:53:05,521 --> 00:53:07,840
Scott: And it was just sort of like this attrition kind of thing.

654
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,940
Scott: But when I played it more recently against Alex, it just sort of got creamed immediately.

655
00:53:13,601 --> 00:53:16,515
Scott: So it was definitely a much tighter game.

656
00:53:16,536 --> 00:53:17,319
Scott: where you can you can.

657
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,579
Scott: It was a very significant winning and losing.

658
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,071
Rym: Well, there's definitely the increasing cost.

659
00:53:23,372 --> 00:53:31,180
Rym: as you do one action more and more to discourage the, you know, obvious, make a whole bunch of red and then destroy a whole bunch of stuff with that red.

660
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:33,820
Emily: I like the increasing price mechanic.

661
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,959
Emily: I think that added a lot.

662
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:41,520
Scott: I think what it is to sum up what I was saying is that in the earlier version of the game, it felt like your individual moves mattered less.

663
00:53:41,862 --> 00:53:45,439
Scott: And in the more recent one, each move matters a whole lot more.

664
00:53:46,002 --> 00:53:49,040
Scott: And so a wrong move here or there can be the difference.

665
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,600
Scott: So there's actually significant decisions being made all the time.

666
00:53:53,242 --> 00:53:56,620
Scott: And that is that is definitely a good thing in a game that I like, at least.

667
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,700
Scott: I don't know about other people.

668
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:04,240
Guest: I think it was Sid Meyer who said the immortal phrase that every game designer should know a game is a series of interesting decisions.

669
00:54:04,623 --> 00:54:05,440
Scott: Yes, that is correct.

670
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:14,200
Rym: I guess I I feel like it'll shine the most in multiplayer because knowing that there's a human making these important decisions on the other side always means a lot to me.

671
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,959
Rym: And of course, you all out in the forums can just play this game with us.

672
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,680
Emily: Just please play this game.

673
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,239
Emily: Everybody listening, please.

674
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:24,300
Emily: Emily asked you, please go check it out.

675
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,360
Rym: I'd be very happy if you have things to say.

676
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,128
Rym: Good or bad.

677
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:29,040
Rym: Just post them in the forum.

678
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:29,563
Guest: Yeah.

679
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,331
Guest: Or email us.

680
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:31,220
Guest: We're there.

681
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:31,763
Guest: We'll listen.

682
00:54:31,783 --> 00:54:32,468
Emily: Yeah, we're.

683
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,799
Emily: I mean, seriously.

684
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:34,403
Emily: Thank us.

685
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:35,979
Emily: We're front row crew.

686
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:42,120
Rym: Just yes, you've got the rare opportunity to talk directly to the game designers about a game they made.

687
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,219
Emily: Yeah, and we might actually listen to you.

688
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,698
Emily: That's a rarity in this business.

689
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,479
Emily: Except with tribes, too, where they listen to much.

690
00:54:50,742 --> 00:54:51,919
Scott: Let's not go down that road.

691
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:52,865
Scott: So the game is.

692
00:54:52,885 --> 00:54:54,780
Scott: so the game is a browser plug any thing.

693
00:54:55,361 --> 00:55:01,580
Scott: And like, you know, other browser games like, say, desktop tower defense, they get like they get posted in like a whole bunch of different sites.

694
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:07,780
Scott: Is your you know, is it possible to put like unity game on like the congregate and all sorts of places or is it only at your website?

695
00:55:08,984 --> 00:55:09,285
Guest: It is.

696
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,220
Guest: It is possible to put a unity game on any site you want.

697
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,919
Guest: I don't believe congregate supports them yet, although they have.

698
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,380
Guest: I've heard internal mutterings that they might eventually.

699
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:21,422
Rym: I don't know.

700
00:55:21,442 --> 00:55:23,960
Rym: You know, I could see it partly just because unity does.

701
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,035
Rym: It really serves a different purpose from flash and it does 3D.

702
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,400
Scott: Well, it's definitely more game centric.

703
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,418
Scott: I mean, is unity used for anything that's not a game?

704
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:40,700
Guest: The closest non game thing I've seen it used for is educational simulations of various kinds, sort of architectural visualization.

705
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:44,099
Emily: Oh, I've seen I've seen architectural stuff done with it.

706
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:51,100
Guest: But it is very specifically a game engine as opposed to Flash, which is this animation tool come programming tool.

707
00:55:51,640 --> 00:56:07,075
Emily: Yeah, actually, I think in terms of game, like the the programming side of it, it it manages the physics and stuff very well, which Flash does not do.

708
00:56:09,183 --> 00:56:11,220
Emily: Anyway, amuse games.

709
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:29,200
Emily: There aren't really any unity game portals right now, but we're kind of hoping that maybe someday our site can become a hub for independent developers, you know, us as a studio, but also us as a community for unity.

710
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,060
Scott: That's definitely a good thing to go for.

711
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:33,980
Scott: I mean, nothing succeeds today without building a community around it.

712
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:34,890
Emily: That's the big part of it.

713
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,462
Emily: Yeah.

714
00:56:36,482 --> 00:56:38,680
Scott: Podcast game, open source project.

715
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:45,659
Emily: And another part of our our business plan is even though we're a very small team, we're about five people.

716
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,480
Emily: We we really want to make games that are fun to play multiplayer over the Internet.

717
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:59,020
Emily: So both multiplayer and single player is one of the requirements for every game we do.

718
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,907
Scott: So you had five people.

719
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:09,079
Scott: about how long did it take, you know, from like let's make a game to well, from let's make this game to it today.

720
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,438
Emily: Well, Muse, Muse Games itself was was launched on April 14th.

721
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:20,158
Emily: But this game has been in development since when about, um, it's a few months ago.

722
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:27,660
Guest: I spent about a month doing the original design document, but that was not the only thing I was working on.

723
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:28,773
Guest: Yeah, that's the thing.

724
00:57:29,782 --> 00:57:45,259
Guest: It's really hard to think because, you know, we're always doing about two weeks to have a what I would actually call a playable prototype and then about another three weeks to a month of work to get it to the final state.

725
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,820
Guest: Again, interspersed with other projects here and there.

726
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,460
Guest: That's why it's actually been more like two months since the design document was finished.

727
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:56,920
Scott: Two months is pretty good for, you know, an entire game.

728
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,680
Scott: I mean, at that rate, you could make, you know, six games a year.

729
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:09,820
Scott: And when you're you know, at least from what I've seen, if you're making small games that are probably not going to be like, you know, stupid, popular all over the Internet, it's, you know, quantity is is a good thing to have.

730
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:16,120
Guest: That is roughly what we're shooting for is a game every two months, and especially now that the site is up and we can focus our energies on the actual games.

731
00:58:16,581 --> 00:58:18,120
Emily: Yeah, that that was a big part of it.

732
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:22,460
Emily: There was a lot of, you know, creating icons for the store and stuff like that.

733
00:58:22,821 --> 00:58:27,599
Scott: And since we all have many hats, so you won't have to do that again because they'll just know this.

734
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:37,979
Emily: The site is there and we can really hone in on doing the, you know, about eight weeks of full on game development if stuff goes well.

735
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,355
Rym: So the game is Elementia, Moo...

736
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:41,838
Emily: Elementia!

737
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,199
Scott: Muse Studios.

738
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,759
Scott: But the link is on frontrowcrew.com.

739
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:46,714
Emily: Musegames.com.

740
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,360
Rym: Yep, there will be links in the show notes.

741
00:58:48,501 --> 00:58:49,058
Rym: You can find that.

742
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,777
Rym: This was Emily Compton and Alex Strawberry.

743
00:58:51,818 --> 00:58:52,160
Rym: Serious.

744
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:53,316
Guest: Jerocher Ernst.

745
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:56,080
Scott: I know his name.

746
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,736
Scott: Why don't you know it?

747
00:58:57,722 --> 00:58:58,580
Guest: Well, he does know my name.

748
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,620
Guest: He just knows it only in translation, apparently.

749
00:59:08,353 --> 00:59:10,430
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

750
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:13,050
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

751
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:24,970
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map and links to all the RSS feeds.

752
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:31,210
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

753
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:33,309
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

754
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,910
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

755
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:41,869
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

756
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:47,389
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com.

757
00:59:48,071 --> 00:59:50,329
Scott: Or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

758
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:53,909
Scott: Just click the link that says Send Me an Odeo on the right side of our website.

759
00:59:54,331 --> 00:59:59,430
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

760
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,750
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website, which has everything.

763
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:20,190
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

764
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:23,770
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
