1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,625
Rym: It's Wednesday October 1st.

2
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:12,488
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,974
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:17,020
Rym: tonight comics are for boys.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:33,950
Rym: So today I decided that I wanted to get a holla.

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,106
Rym: But of course there's a crazy line to get holla's on the train station.

8
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:39,230
Scott: It's Rosh Hashanah.

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,645
Scott: So holla is very popular on Rosh Hashanah.

10
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:48,425
Rym: - yeah But as a result I left work early and I even said when they said why you'll even work I said I gotta get a holla.

11
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:48,990
Scott: That's right.

12
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,056
Scott: Hey, you gotta get a holla today.

13
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:55,650
Rym: You gotta wake up to which real early to which my co-workers said you're not Jewish.

14
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,686
Rym: So and I was like, yeah, I want a holla.

15
00:00:58,727 --> 00:00:59,089
Rym: What do you want?

16
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:03,991
Rym: So I get in line right and there's this Jewish guy Like.

17
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:08,463
Rym: he looked very like traditional possibly acidic and he's standing anyway.

18
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,469
Scott: He was wearing like the big hat and everything.

19
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:13,941
Scott: Okay Crazy beard and it wasn't that crazy.

20
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:15,570
Rym: He was kind of young but he's standing there, right?

21
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:19,926
Rym: So I walk, you know, there's this line and he's asking everyone who comes up like are you Jewish?

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,236
Scott: Oh He's what he's looking to.

23
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:23,804
Scott: He's asking everybody's.

24
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:24,266
Scott: he's look.

25
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:25,190
Scott: He's probably from the.

26
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:33,109
Rym: But anyway, my story gets interesting because you know me I do not shy from a challenge.

27
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:39,230
Rym: So I get up there and he seems to because the guy in front of me gets like a cupcake and he doesn't ask him.

28
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,980
Rym: I think he's only asking the people who buy holla's duh.

29
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:45,696
Rym: So I buy my holla and he says Excuse me.

30
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:46,223
Rym: Are you Jewish?

31
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:49,257
Rym: And I say No, I don't really believe in God.

32
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:52,310
Rym: and he says neither do I but I believe in honey and bread.

33
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,136
Rym: And I was like, I also believe in honey and bread.

34
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:58,080
Rym: and he was like have a good day and I was like you too.

35
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:04,989
Rym: Either he was an atheist or he has a sense of humor and I'm okay with either one of those.

36
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:12,510
Scott: That's the thing is you'd be surprised how many Jews are atheists and some of them have twisted logics and some of them don't.

37
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:19,545
Rym: Well, I think the thing is that very few people who don't who aren't Christian will say they're Christian because there's just.

38
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:26,730
Rym: there's the religion and then like culture is all Different but there's the Jewish religion and the Jewish culture and a lot of people who are one or not the other and vice versa.

39
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:32,364
Scott: No, but there are even people who are Religiously Jewish, but they don't actually like.

40
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:40,230
Scott: they'll be a guy you look at him He's a rabbi doesn't actually literally believe in any sort of deity whatsoever, but he believes in the milk and the honey.

41
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:41,874
Scott: Yeah, you know they.

42
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:44,962
Scott: they you know, they're Jewish for other reasons and they do the.

43
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:47,910
Scott: they keep kosher other reasons besides.

44
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:51,590
Scott: No, not as good will smite you know, he's psychic for his own reason exactly.

45
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:55,846
Rym: Anyway, that was the most exciting thing that happened to me today on the train.

46
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:58,859
Scott: on the way home today There was you know, the doors on the train.

47
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:02,013
Scott: It seems like wherever I sit on the train these days The door is broken.

48
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:02,776
Scott: I must have a broken.

49
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,064
Rym: so the vestibule is just loud and everyone's angry.

50
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:07,312
Scott: right or it won't open Right.

51
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,790
Scott: and today it was the weirdest situation yet.

52
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:12,356
Scott: The door right.

53
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:17,530
Scott: you would push the button and sometimes the button would do nothing, but sometimes it would work just fine.

54
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:25,149
Scott: but you know everyone just kept manipulating the door a whole bunch and it eventually would only open halfway.

55
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,609
Scott: and This guy sitting near me actually was a smart guy and he kept up.

56
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,763
Scott: He kept going to actually try to fix it.

57
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:32,769
Scott: the conductor didn't do shit.

58
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:36,207
Scott: The conductor just puts it in manual mode opens it all the way and walks away.

59
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:36,690
Scott: It doesn't care.

60
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,103
Rym: That's fine because then you can close it and open it right.

61
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:43,550
Scott: but you know This guy actually kept trying to fix it and he did fix it a couple of times.

62
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:51,739
Scott: But then every time someone came up to it It was broken again and you would see like a person would Manipulated a whole bunch and just they'd push the button.

63
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:52,341
Scott: It doesn't work.

64
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:57,498
Scott: push push push like ten times, you know It's like what are you doing?

65
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:57,779
Scott: Dude?

66
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,324
Scott: You didn't work the first time.

67
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:00,990
Scott: It's not gonna work the second time.

68
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:01,569
Scott: It's not good.

69
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,870
Rym: You know the best is when you see someone who walks up and they like they fiddle with it.

70
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,141
Rym: They finally get it open and there's someone behind them.

71
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:19,029
Scott: That person does not learn from the person To say it was like there's a line of people and every single person Kept coming up and making the same stupid mistakes and fiddling with the door for ten minutes.

72
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,249
Scott: Just it doors open halfway right now.

73
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:27,250
Scott: It's not gonna be fixed unless you actually stop and fix it which you obviously don't know how to do.

74
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,408
Scott: So it's gonna walk around it and keep going.

75
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:32,989
Rym: God It was the moral of the story that you didn't have anything to do on the train because you know

76
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,338
Scott: I don't pay attention to the drama

77
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:36,533
Rym: of the door I don't

78
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:42,778
Scott: need it, but I was sitting right next to the door and I was reading my book But every time someone came up to the door They were kicking it a whole bunch and made a lot of noise

79
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,490
Rym: and as they stormed the mountain and kicked him to death

80
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:46,473
Scott: Exactly.

81
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:52,232
Scott: So I think what it is is that I think in general we need to have you know More.

82
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,762
Scott: people need to learn how to fix things.

83
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:54,608
Rym: We need door training.

84
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:55,433
Scott: That's it.

85
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:59,030
Rym: We also add the use of doors as like a first-grade class.

86
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,317
Scott: I think we also just need.

87
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,750
Rym: it seems like people learn how to open the fuck out of doors.

88
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:09,790
Scott: It seems like in our culture There's a thing against just going up and fixing something that's broken if it's not yours or not your responsibility.

89
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,610
Scott: Almost like you're not supposed to fix something if it's not yours.

90
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,770
Scott: Like you might get in trouble for doing good and I think we need to get away.

91
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,457
Rym: No, I think mostly just people though.

92
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:19,104
Rym: It's not a matter of people are afraid.

93
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:20,530
Rym: They just really don't care.

94
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:27,025
Scott: Yeah, but there are also many situations where if you know how to fix like if someone has a problem with their computer You can't just go up and fix it.

95
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:29,556
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

96
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,130
Rym: I wouldn't anyway because that's not worth my time.

97
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:34,610
Scott: I know I know but it's frustrating when something's broken.

98
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:39,668
Scott: It's like I could have gotten on my Leatherman opened up a little panel and actually fixed the door.

99
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:45,149
Rym: but now Highly doubt that you would have been able to fix that because I knew exactly what was wrong What was wrong with it?

100
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,442
Scott: There was a thing stuck that's got slid under the door there.

101
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:50,250
Scott: that was stuck in there keeping it from open all the way.

102
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,659
Scott: I could just opened it up and taking that.

103
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,345
Rym: you know, whatever piece of junk got in there I'm dubious of your ability to perform maintenance on the train door.

104
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:58,309
Rym: It's kind of complicated.

105
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,158
Scott: in there I think I can remove a piece of junk.

106
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,342
Scott: I can remove a paper.

107
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:02,743
Scott: Jam.

108
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:04,569
Scott: I can remove a piece of junk.

109
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:08,130
Scott: It's a. The point is is that I would have gotten.

110
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:12,863
Rym: You just talked for quite a while about the door on the train.

111
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,668
Rym: Yeah, that wouldn't open all the way.

112
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:15,150
Scott: That's right.

113
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:19,923
Rym: But anyway, maybe anime maybe I don't know.

114
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,830
Scott: there's not so much news going to hell.

115
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,513
Rym: There's some news.

116
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:29,350
Rym: you see the previous weekend was the New York Anime Festival 2008 in New York Went to for like the shortest amount of time.

117
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:32,015
Rym: Well, the thing is, you know We've been doing like.

118
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:40,206
Rym: we've kind of gotten to this point where there's so many panels of cons that Or our plan is actually to kind of scale back and do fewer higher quality panels.

119
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,210
Scott: That's a good plan.

120
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:46,147
Scott: I've also noticed just at anime conventions in general like there's less for me to do like.

121
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:54,504
Scott: I went there I literally did three panels walked and saw everything in the dealers You know exhibition room once and then I was done.

122
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:58,341
Scott: I did nothing on the schedule I wanted to go to except the MC Chris concert, which I missed.

123
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:00,590
Rym: Well, uh, we had to do the geeky guy.

124
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:03,116
Rym: Goodbye, of course But part of it said that's not.

125
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,019
Rym: I mean different.

126
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:12,003
Rym: every anime cons different and like Otakon is different vibe from the New York Anime Festival different vibe from Katsu Kahn and There wasn't really much of a hanging out con.

127
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:15,590
Rym: It's more of a alright You're in that you live nearby and you're into anime.

128
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:21,549
Rym: It's worth it pretty pretty much for anyone who's an anime to go there for one of the three days because there's stuff to do.

129
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:30,767
Scott: Yeah, it seemed like there was a lot of hanging out like kids are just hanging out making mischief all over the place and you Know the hallways and the lobbies and etc, etc.

130
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:37,009
Scott: but it really wasn't so exciting for me to be there other than get to give the panels and the.

131
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,036
Scott: You know look around the room once.

132
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:39,377
Scott: that was it.

133
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:39,920
Scott: I was done.

134
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:40,463
Rym: Yeah.

135
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:46,250
Rym: Well then again, it's not like I mean there were events I kind of actually wanted to go to but like we literally showed up to do the three panels.

136
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:51,593
Scott: Oh, well, that's the other thing I missed that I did want to see was I wanted to see the girl who does anime news Nina Robin Savickas.

137
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:52,776
Scott: Yeah, she was there.

138
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,120
Rym: I wanted to see MC Chris again.

139
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:58,249
Rym: Actually, I heard sadly that not many people went to the MC Chris concert.

140
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:00,795
Rym: MC Chris is awesome.

141
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,083
Rym: He's no MC front a lot, but he's awesome.

142
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:04,870
Scott: No, I think they should tag team.

143
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:06,016
Rym: I don't know.

144
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,227
Rym: They really have the same style.

145
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:08,353
Rym: MC Chris is mostly.

146
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:12,104
Rym: he stands there and yells at you on melodically but funnily.

147
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:15,636
Rym: meanwhile MC front a lot Kind of raps at you.

148
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:16,920
Rym: It's a different vibe.

149
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:20,573
Scott: Yeah, it is a different vibe, but you know, whatever It's all good.

150
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:27,553
Rym: But anyway, we did our three panels, you know, we finally we did the last time We're gonna do the gecky got panel Never again.

151
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:30,826
Rym: The thing is, you know, how many people emailed us after the con.

152
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,837
Rym: they were like, yeah We missed the gecky got panel.

153
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:34,990
Rym: Will you do it at insert name of con here?

154
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,664
Scott: I'm like, we're never doing it again and it's done.

155
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,549
Scott: I've done it.

156
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,729
Scott: I've done it that many times and you've never made it to the con.

157
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:46,874
Rym: Well, the thing is the press actually came up to like after we did and they talked to me while Scott was talking to other People.

158
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:54,372
Rym: they were like, yeah So you guys ever thought about filming a definitive version of this and putting it out there so we could just kind of link to It.

159
00:08:54,877 --> 00:08:58,200
Rym: Yeah, I Feel like if we do that, we got to get Gerald involved.

160
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,250
Scott: Maybe alright, maybe we could do that.

161
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,130
Scott: We could take any panels that are dead and are never gonna be a convention again and then put those online.

162
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,821
Rym: I feel like that's actually a really good.

163
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:12,983
Rym: I think that's okay that every Should make kind of the round through all the conventions and then to retire it.

164
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:14,869
Rym: we do the definitive word.

165
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:21,230
Scott: Yeah, cuz then the bit the one version we put online will be so well practiced that it will be turn out really well.

166
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:24,850
Rym: It's kind of like how if you go see a band in concert, you know, they play things kind of differently.

167
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:33,710
Rym: But there's always the album version of the song like everyone knows the album version of stairway to heaven Yep, and everyone when they think of the song they think of that.

168
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:38,584
Rym: But then there's the cool people who saw him in concert who might remember the other version they heard.

169
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:39,246
Rym: Yep.

170
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:45,470
Scott: Oh So anime news, it's not so it's not so strong.

171
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:49,424
Scott: That's why I got a resort to this kind of and news, but it's not the worst thing in the world.

172
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:56,810
Scott: All right, so apparently You know how Lupin and many of the Lupin movies is always seen driving that little yellow car.

173
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:59,440
Scott: I mean he's been seen driving some other cars too.

174
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:07,110
Scott: Like once he was driving that, you know, um, six-wheeled f1 car with the Don't forget ground effects.

175
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:15,990
Rym: I think that my favorite vehicle of his is the motorcycle that he rode across that clown's face in the best Lupin movie Babylon go best said with a head with.

176
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:20,383
Rym: Is that far and away the best Lupin there ever was right, right?

177
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,490
Scott: He also drove that car.

178
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:26,189
Scott: It was just sort of like a long car, you know has the tire on the back, you know what I'm talking about.

179
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:32,908
Scott: But mostly he's known for that little yellow Fiat kind of car and Fiat is actually going to make and people don't know.

180
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:35,290
Scott: Fiat is I think an Italian car company.

181
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:36,374
Scott: It's really.

182
00:10:36,414 --> 00:10:39,565
Scott: it's owned by the say it by Ford and Ferrari and it's all.

183
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:41,573
Scott: it's all the same company really But it's not.

184
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:43,643
Scott: but they make little cars.

185
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:48,890
Scott: if you go to Europe or you know People are in Europe know this but people in Europe might not know that there are no Fiat's in the US.

186
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:52,467
Rym: We don't have those cars there are but they're in the hands of wealthy people.

187
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:53,090
Scott: Well, they're eight.

188
00:10:53,110 --> 00:11:03,209
Scott: Well, they're incredibly rare, but in Europe a Fiat's like a small economic car for the average person, you know It's like a kind of car a high school kid will have you know, depending on which Fiat.

189
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,157
Scott: But yeah, Fiat is just a really tiny.

190
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:08,323
Scott: they make tiny efficient normal cars.

191
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:10,749
Scott: Some of them little cool some of them not so cool.

192
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:15,021
Scott: and Fiat is going to make that yellow Lupin car.

193
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,169
Scott: They're gonna make like five hundred of them or so.

194
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:20,982
Scott: and I guess Rym you should try to buy one you the car.

195
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:22,390
Rym: I don't need a Fiat.

196
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,779
Scott: We get it why it'd be really efficient.

197
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,530
Scott: be small like you want and it'll be a Lupin car.

198
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,250
Scott: Wait, wait, wait, I think you put the Otari license plate on it for the ultimate awesome.

199
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,520
Rym: No, I feel like if I'm getting the Otari license plate transferred to another car.

200
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,088
Rym: It's gotta be a red like 98 Miata.

201
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,170
Scott: No, I gotta get some gold Rym yellow Lupin Fiat.

202
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,167
Scott: We could drive it on the wall.

203
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:48,070
Rym: See it's weird because I feel like if I got like the Miata is the perfect Accio car in terms of like the feel.

204
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:55,150
Rym: But the car in the show is more like this long like there's a gigantic backseat.

205
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,090
Rym: It's almost like a convertible Buick.

206
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,097
Scott: Yeah, it's it's well you can get.

207
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:03,690
Scott: you could probably get a red like Chrysler Sebring.

208
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,129
Scott: It's not good.

209
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,916
Rym: It's the only time where the you tend.

210
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:12,171
Rym: a movie is actually worth something because in the movie that is exactly the car I can Get.

211
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:13,799
Rym: I don't know.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,870
Scott: Oh, oh the naked one in the movie.

213
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:17,357
Rym: No, not the naked one.

214
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:18,784
Rym: the naked one doesn't exist.

215
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:22,423
Scott: talking about the Accio I thought you were talking that you could get the naked car.

216
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:23,770
Scott: I know I can get the naked car.

217
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,292
Scott: Why can't you?

218
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:25,516
Rym: I can get the Accio car.

219
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:26,821
Rym: the naked car does not exist.

220
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:29,149
Rym: It's a pink like formula car.

221
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:32,424
Scott: No, no, I meant that the naked car just two naked girls on a stick.

222
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,370
Rym: Oh Well, the thing is the naked car goes through all these stages of nakedness.

223
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,410
Rym: It goes from partially naked to fully naked - I didn't think it could get more.

224
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,419
Scott: Maybe that's the cosplay.

225
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:47,804
Rym: we should make the naked car Wait, so we get two girls to be naked on a stick.

226
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,410
Scott: No, no, but we'd have them.

227
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:56,810
Scott: We basically have this car made out of cardboard, right and they'd be on a stick standing up But we'd put like a video of a moving street behind them.

228
00:12:57,171 --> 00:13:01,769
Scott: So you're sitting in the audience and you're looking at the top of the car, but it looks like you're looking at it.

229
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,310
Rym: So this is a cosplay performance not just a walk around cosplay.

230
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,878
Scott: What what other kind of cosplay is there?

231
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,969
Rym: because I realize that that that's not.

232
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,440
Rym: No cosplay is ever gonna be good again.

233
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:18,130
Rym: until I see someone at Otakon Flip over the hood windshield until I see someone at Otakon do what they did in here is Greenwood.

234
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,964
Rym: I've never seen anyone do that at a con.

235
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:23,977
Scott: Oh with the whole Clock and everything.

236
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:25,080
Rym: Yeah, you see that.

237
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,686
Rym: Why doesn't anyone do that?

238
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:30,170
Rym: They did in Tokimeki Memorial Yes, but they didn't do it in America.

239
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,240
Rym: I've never seen anyone do it.

240
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,569
Rym: if anyone out there Knows of an anime convention where anyone did the here is Greenwood thing and if you don't know what that is.

241
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,616
Rym: You're way too young.

242
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:40,841
Scott: It takes a lot of manufacture.

243
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,730
Scott: It's a lot of set construction to make that happen.

244
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:46,910
Rym: No, see modern era you make a giant backdrop and you just throw it down.

245
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,309
Rym: So things of the day.

246
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,254
Rym: now, we're not gonna review this tonight But we're gonna review it as soon as Scott watches it again.

247
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:02,825
Scott: I haven't watched it since 2000.

248
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:03,728
Rym: you know a lot of times.

249
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:09,020
Rym: you watch it like there's an old show that you love and then you know It's like 10 years later and you decide to watch it again.

250
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,560
Rym: You realize it's stupid or it's not quite as good as you remember or it's completely different from you remember.

251
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:23,294
Rym: Well, KO century beast is not only exactly as good as I remember It's better than I remember for reasons that I'll get into when we finally review it.

252
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:25,140
Rym: That show is awesome.

253
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:34,798
Scott: There are a lot of shows we watched back in the days of our ITN Where we got VHS tape a digital target VHS tapes from the club library.

254
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:41,746
Rym: Christiania Christiania, whatever, you know what legend of poop bastard Bastard, that's a good show.

255
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:44,780
Scott: brought them back to the dorm rooms.

256
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:48,799
Scott: We put them in a tiny via a VCR with a tiny television.

257
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:54,210
Scott: We watched them while we were dead tired And I fell asleep often while they were on.

258
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,357
Rym: I think it is the Irish anime club white right.

259
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:59,769
Rym: you could check out Three VHS tapes per week.

260
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,500
Rym: So there were you know, like ten people in the front row crew.

261
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:10,280
Rym: We'd all each check out three tapes and then we would watch Much of that anime over the course of that weekend.

262
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:19,105
Scott: Yeah, so we saw all these crazy shows and I remember we watched like, you know, Kota Monocha, whatever Summary movie.

263
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:22,480
Scott: Yeah, I fell asleep during the whole thing.

264
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,170
Scott: I didn't even see the beginning or the end or the middle.

265
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:31,411
Scott: and yet we watch those sleep as it was starting Before anything happened and I woke up after the credits.

266
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,539
Rym: and yet we watched shows before that and after that that night.

267
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:44,360
Scott: Yeah, anyway, we see these all these shows and now that we're re-watching a few of these shows We're actually seeing what they were really like because our memories are completely wrong.

268
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,609
Rym: Well, actually no what I found is that our memories are right.

269
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:53,611
Rym: for example Legend of Lemnier still bad really bad But KO Century Beast.

270
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:55,840
Rym: I'm not gonna tell you my opinion of it.

271
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,602
Scott: So good.

272
00:15:56,763 --> 00:16:02,780
Rym: My thing of the day is the second opener only because you couldn't find the first opener on YouTube.

273
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,252
Rym: I couldn't find the first opener on YouTube, which I actually prefer.

274
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:08,119
Rym: I just I think the song is really really cute.

275
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,030
Scott: this No reason about this show.

276
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,740
Scott: I only watch this show once in my life.

277
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:18,720
Scott: I don't know why but I have like completely memorized both opening songs in Japanese.

278
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:19,689
Rym: It was kind of scary.

279
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:20,839
Rym: Scott and I were kind of singing along.

280
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:31,508
Rym: But to this day, I still remember my thing of the day is the second opener to KO Century Beast aka Rock-and-roll bomber love missile.

281
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:32,551
Rym: three two one.

282
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:33,293
Rym: Let's go.

283
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:35,680
Scott: I think it's three two one zero.

284
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:36,844
Rym: Oh, yeah, zero.

285
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:38,630
Rym: Well and a whole no.

286
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,116
Rym: Oh, no rock and roll.

287
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,280
Rym: I think it isn't it?

288
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:51,588
Rym: Oh My god, this is open or great show.

289
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,840
Rym: and also I forgot the show is actually a robot show.

290
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:57,549
Rym: Yeah, partially no almost entire.

291
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,095
Rym: It's like 80% robot show.

292
00:16:59,155 --> 00:17:00,420
Scott: There's a lot of robot going on.

293
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,493
Scott: It's basically not magic easy, but it's got robots.

294
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,200
Rym: It's a. it is a robot show.

295
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:07,420
Rym: Do not do not be fooled.

296
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:18,119
Scott: Alright seeing as it, you know Rym had to dig away back for a thing of the day Which is an opener to an old anime However, an anime that does not get enough love and as a result, I feel like many of you have not seen this.

297
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,920
Scott: Yeah, I also had to go back and dig for a thing of the day because the internet is devoid.

298
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,428
Scott: I mean I went looking for a dig.

299
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:25,994
Rym: Wait a minute as in digger on Paul.

300
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:33,940
Scott: No As in you know digging with a shovel I mean I was gonna go get some Hatsune Miku or something, but I couldn't find one that interested me.

301
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:39,980
Rym: Well, you've already said I mean the best one is still the one that did that closer to the one sergeant frog, right?

302
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,562
Scott: Exactly.

303
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:46,660
Scott: That's like the best house name because unless the house name who comes along is better than that I'm gonna leave her alone for a while, even though she's still awesome.

304
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,071
Rym: Well, if one does it's probably going to cause a macross to happen.

305
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:52,880
Scott: Yeah, but I just decided you know what?

306
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:55,560
Scott: I don't know if I've done this for a thing in the day before.

307
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,179
Scott: I'm pretty sure I haven't because I searched the website and didn't find it.

308
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:02,294
Scott: This is the greatest anime music video to ever exist.

309
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:03,820
Scott: It is the Mambo Leo.

310
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:05,872
Scott: If you haven't seen it, what's wrong with you?

311
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:07,059
Rym: one more thing?

312
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,118
Rym: I don't know if anyone out there realizes people who aren't you know in with the front row crew.

313
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:13,744
Scott: Mambo Leo has a history.

314
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:18,460
Rym: the Mambo Leo is like the official music video of the front row crew.

315
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,647
Scott: Well, why would he pick one?

316
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:20,552
Scott: That wasn't the best?

317
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:21,720
Rym: Well, there's more to it.

318
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,592
Rym: I mean at the fact that it survived to this day that there's still.

319
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:30,226
Rym: there's a video of us doing the dance even though I Think we're between all of us.

320
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:33,780
Rym: We knew the whole dance but no one of us knew all of the dance.

321
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:39,905
Rym: Yeah, but that video did not show you doing it all But it descended into chaos.

322
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:42,171
Rym: right suffice to say there's video.

323
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:43,073
Rym: There's the song.

324
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:45,520
Rym: there is the Spanish version of the song.

325
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:50,625
Rym: There is the dance that Luke created that we all learned And slightly modified.

326
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:51,508
Rym: there's a history.

327
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:54,236
Scott: Yeah, basically we saw this music video.

328
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:54,918
Scott: It was amazing.

329
00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:55,800
Scott: The song is amazing.

330
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:59,379
Scott: We made up a dance to do to the song.

331
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:03,612
Scott: Then we would play the music video and do the dance multiple times.

332
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:06,160
Scott: at most recently we whipped it out at a wedding.

333
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,633
Rym: But I mean this goes back to RIT anime club.

334
00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:15,680
Rym: like music nights The Mambo Leo would play and suddenly like the whole front of the room is filled with the eboard and the front row crew dancing.

335
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:17,820
Rym: Yep, we did it at conventions.

336
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:22,920
Rym: I danced it at the my final moment of glory at the RIT anime club before I step down.

337
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,635
Scott: We could do it as a cosplay at an anime convention and probably win.

338
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:27,900
Scott: The only problem is I'm not.

339
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:30,859
Scott: I'm not doing a perfect blue cosplay.

340
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:36,434
Rym: You know if the entire front row crew did the perfect blue cosplay.

341
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,237
Rym: I think we could win.

342
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:39,107
Scott: I'll be the director I'll be.

343
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:40,740
Scott: I'll do a Satoshi khan cosplay.

344
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:44,153
Scott: The only rule I get an icon camera and a scary beard.

345
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:46,923
Rym: the best way to do it is You have a simple rule.

346
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,391
Rym: No one is allowed to shave for a month before Otakon.

347
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,477
Rym: No legs faces anything.

348
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:55,530
Scott: No All right, so check this out.

349
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,338
Scott: at the New York anime festival, right?

350
00:19:57,418 --> 00:20:01,520
Scott: and also At Otakon we did this panel comics for the manga fan, right?

351
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:19,720
Scott: And basically the idea of this panel was we would try to get people who are just mainly manga fans You know the kind of people at an anime convention to enjoy all comics not just comics that are from Japan And we would do this by giving them many examples of awesome comics They should go out and read that are not manga.

352
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:24,337
Rym: In fact, we also talk a lot about and or not anime manga that are good to read.

353
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,968
Rym: that a lot of manga fans haven't read yep,

354
00:20:26,897 --> 00:20:33,119
Scott: and You know on our way to the you know, New York any festival Emily mentioned, you know that

355
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:44,720
Emily: We were in the subway car and I was like so You're gonna address any of the stuff for shoujo fans because there's probably a lot of girls here who mainly read shoujo.

356
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:48,091
Emily: And you know think of some romance comics or something.

357
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:52,184
Emily: and Scott was like the romance comics from the 60s And I was like, oh god.

358
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:53,388
Emily: No, I'll go Bargo.

359
00:20:53,409 --> 00:21:00,380
Emily: I was something like, you know my faith and Frankie or Any of the other ones like that.

360
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,538
Scott: Alright, so, you know, we already sort of had that on our minds like, huh, huh, maybe.

361
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:13,955
Rym: hmm I have to think about it right, you know, because I mean my answer was well If they're really into that specific kind of thing manga is kind of where it's at right now.

362
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:15,360
Scott: That is that is sort of true.

363
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:16,898
Emily: There's not many be shown in.

364
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:19,724
Emily: Much American made.

365
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,309
Rym: yeah, there's no like shown in simple.

366
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:30,828
Scott: I'm sure there's been shown in Superman yaoi, but it's not made over here Right, so actually after the panel I'm like when I got home there was an email waiting for me Email.

367
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,280
Scott: so I was gonna do this as a geek back, but we decided to turn it.

368
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:38,999
Rym: What Scott did is he got this email and I could see that he was gonna respond to it.

369
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:44,090
Rym: And then he like he had to check himself be like no I'll respond to publicly in the show.

370
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,583
Scott: that's right because as soon as I saw this email I'm like, oh this has to be a show There's.

371
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:52,830
Scott: no it's too much to say for it You know to be wasted on a forum post or a private email.

372
00:21:53,111 --> 00:22:00,920
Emily: and I finagled my way onto the show because Rym Cancelled their panel on Sunday and I was mad and I was like for punishment.

373
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:03,200
Emily: You have to have me on the show on Wednesday.

374
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:04,325
Emily: So I actually I was.

375
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:07,600
Scott: I was like if I do that if I turn this into a show, I'm gonna need Emily.

376
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:15,084
Emily: I should be like Clarissa and be like Emily the girl We were.

377
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:22,986
Rym: any other lame geek podcast we'd have made the joke that Yes, so we got an expert on the subject of being Anything is at work.

378
00:22:23,347 --> 00:22:28,680
Emily: They they were gonna actually interview me about like how does being a girl affect your perspective?

379
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:37,180
Emily: You know art and I was just like well, how does your perspective of being a guy affect your marketing?

380
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:43,490
Rym: I would have said that Everything cylindrical is an oppressive phallic reference.

381
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:51,240
Scott: Yeah So anyway, we got this email about this.

382
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,157
Scott: You know particular topic and I wanted to reply to the email.

383
00:22:55,257 --> 00:23:03,420
Scott: in a show I wanted Emily to be there and I want you know Emily You know bothered room about being on the show and the listeners bothered us about Emily being on the show.

384
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,566
Emily: So thank you guys.

385
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:05,712
Scott: We have planets planets aligning here.

386
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:12,000
Rym: So we've actually gotten more feedback saying get Emily on the show more than we have about any other single topic.

387
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:20,420
Scott: Yeah, it makes me blush with with planets such you know in this configuration How could we not do this show and you know, it's it's gotta be good show.

388
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Scott: Anyway, so I'm gonna read this email and then I want to respond sort of directly to the accusation of the email and you know Sort of defend ourselves and then we can talk more generally about the topic at hand.

389
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,757
Scott: All right, this is the email from someone named satellite.

390
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:41,940
Scott: All right Hi, I attended your panel comics for the manga fan yesterday at the New York anime festival.

391
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:45,972
Scott: One comment about the suggestions you put forward during this presentation.

392
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:48,420
Scott: I think they're pretty much all male oriented.

393
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:51,870
Scott: Sorry, but most girls are not going to go for Watchmen parentheses.

394
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,600
Scott: Just look at the name parentheses Frank Miller or atomic Robo.

395
00:23:56,102 --> 00:24:00,020
Scott: You should investigate what there is of non manga with more of an emphasis on females.

396
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:09,990
Scott: I have not a shell for this comic but one title that comes to mind is skeleton key by Andy Watson a Brit a Manga influenced comic from the 90s published by slave labor graphics.

397
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:12,622
Scott: The comic is widely available at Amazon and others.

398
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:14,229
Scott: Amazon link to the comic.

399
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:21,439
Scott: To me something like this would much more fall under the category Comics for the manga fan the presentation you guys did.

400
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:28,447
Scott: I would have titled some Western comics that don't suck But I did enjoy your presentation of the Western comics that don't suck.

401
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:52,866
Emily: Here's one thing I kind of want to say is that When when people hear the term Western comics for the manga reader they think of You know more of the Tokyo pop English language stuff whereas what we decided to do and what we think of when we think of Comics that would appeal to a manga reader is we don't just look at style.

402
00:24:52,946 --> 00:25:06,499
Emily: We look more at You know content and I think the thing that drew at least all my friends to Manga and anime in the first place is that it had Deeper themes and it had really developed characters.

403
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:16,659
Emily: So it's less about the art style and more about about these darker darker issues and Complex characters.

404
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:16,960
Emily: Yep.

405
00:25:17,302 --> 00:25:17,644
Rym: I'll leave it.

406
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,910
Rym: I don't even want to beat around the bush.

407
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:22,085
Rym: I feel like the accusation itself doesn't really make sense yet.

408
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:26,619
Rym: How could Watchmen I was Watchmen aimed like.

409
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:29,830
Rym: how is that a male comic exactly exactly?

410
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:41,630
Scott: Obviously someone who hasn't read Watchmen It's not watching women right now, I want to list the comics we talked about just real quick.

411
00:25:41,710 --> 00:26:02,036
Scott: All right, Watchmen V for Vendetta the surrogates Scott Pilgrim black sad bone Dark Knight Returns the spirit runaways x-mock, you know wide last man fables atomic robo walking dead all the works of Jason Mouse guard and The life and times of Scrooge McDuck.

412
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:03,421
Rym: Those are the comics.

413
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:05,990
Rym: You mean McDuck McDuck, right?

414
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:07,674
Scott: So Scrooge Scrooge.

415
00:26:07,714 --> 00:26:21,357
Scott: All right, so, you know, I guess you could sort of you know It's it's not hard to say I guess something like atomic robo is a little bit sort of classically male Action figury sort of stuff.

416
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:31,850
Emily: right thing about Frank Miller is I gotta say from the Frank Miller stuff I've read he does tend to have kind of dumb portrayals of female.

417
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:40,464
Rym: Yes, either he is the whore Dumb weak woman or the strong-willed hooker with the heart of gold.

418
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:41,547
Rym: That's it evil hooker.

419
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:50,960
Emily: One thing it was funny cuz I was reading Scrooge McDuck and that was the comic that everybody was like.

420
00:26:51,021 --> 00:27:00,950
Emily: what the fuck why is These comics, you know people talk about shoujo and stuff being about relationships.

421
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:09,010
Emily: I mean Scrooge McDuck has a lot of comedy and it has a lot of you know adventure and daring.

422
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:11,576
Scott: But it has Goldie.

423
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:29,689
Emily: and there is this one story and I was reading this last night where it's he's a minor and maybe Maybe I'll save the description for when you guys But this is actually a Really good Relationship story like it's a cute cute love story.

424
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:32,737
Rym: Yep, plus I just I feel like what's the?

425
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:36,530
Rym: does it have to be a relationship comic in order to count as a girl?

426
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:47,870
Rym: I mean, I guess what bothers me is that I remember when I was a kid, you know young like five six seven eight years old All the guys would play with GI Joe get things, you know army stuff and all the girls would play with Barbies.

427
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:53,130
Rym: But all the girls would also play with GI Joe stuff, but the guys couldn't play with Barbies.

428
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:55,882
Scott: Yeah, see I feel sort of like what?

429
00:27:56,082 --> 00:27:57,830
Scott: what we're being accused of here, right?

430
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,710
Scott: It's like you go to the toy store, right and you've got these sort of Barbie aisle where everything's pink, right?

431
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,107
Scott: You've got the aisle with all the action figures, you know Ninja Turtles and he-man and transformers, right?

432
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,827
Scott: That's sort of a guy I'll you know.

433
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,928
Rym: Also all the girls I knew totally played with he-man, right?

434
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:14,330
Scott: That's true.

435
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,530
Scott: But then all the other aisles like you've got the board game aisle the Lego aisle, right?

436
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:28,850
Scott: Game I was clearly aimed at man the video game Isle with just the blocks clearly and the dice and the jacks and those sorts of things, right?

437
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,136
Scott: and those are sort of like the everyone aisles.

438
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:44,302
Scott: and it's sort of like I feel that if we Mention either, you know action figury things or Barbie things, you know, then that is what sexist we.

439
00:28:44,342 --> 00:28:47,994
Scott: basically everything we've mentioned here is a blocks I'll board game.

440
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:49,159
Scott: I'll kind of thing.

441
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:52,290
Scott: It's it's not for guys or for girls for everyone.

442
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,897
Scott: You know Mouse Guard is for everyone Scrooge McDuck is for everyone.

443
00:28:54,937 --> 00:28:55,800
Scott: Jason's for everyone.

444
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:57,384
Scott: zombies are for everyone.

445
00:28:57,806 --> 00:28:59,310
Scott: fables is for everyone.

446
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:05,658
Rym: Girl demographic that a guy doesn't run away.

447
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:11,810
Scott: spirit bone black sad watchmen V for Vendetta Those are all for everyone regardless of gender.

448
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:29,249
Scott: It's basically she's saying you didn't mention anything from the Barbie aisle and in a way that's more Sexist to mention things from the Barbie aisle, you know And I think that's partially because the sexism of Japan has sort of come over with their manga.

449
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:33,903
Scott: in a way I mean in the US we don't we have genres like science fiction.

450
00:29:33,923 --> 00:29:36,010
Scott: We don't have genres like young boys.

451
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:44,621
Emily: Doesn't this relate back to remember when you had that big Big row with Clarissa over to Tara.

452
00:29:44,722 --> 00:29:47,070
Rym: Is it show Joe Joe or Shonen?

453
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,696
Emily: No, it's hard sci-fi.

454
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:51,870
Emily: So what's the deal here, but it's it's the same sort of thing.

455
00:29:51,970 --> 00:30:01,668
Emily: it's basically show Joe and Shonen has become kind of just a Term to mark what kind of magazine it was published in and whether more girls or more boys.

456
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:15,250
Emily: by it I mean, there's a there's a huge huge female readership for Shonen jump and most of the anime fans I knew who are girls were mostly fans of the the sports anime and the Shonen jump titles.

457
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:20,814
Rym: So I run into more girls who were fans of like I shield 21 then guys ever You know what?

458
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:21,578
Emily: I'd relate it to.

459
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:34,725
Emily: I like the analogy of the Barbie aisle but I always thought it was kind of like the people who only thought of show Joe or Who were very strict in their definitions of the the boys comics versus girls comics.

460
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:47,009
Emily: It's kind of like those those oxygen television networks, you know They have these television networks that are supposedly for women and these television networks for men like sport TV.

461
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:48,416
Emily: We're hardcore.

462
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:55,543
Emily: Well, actually the the programming is Is really kind of lame especially on the on the women's.

463
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:59,780
Rym: what really bothers me is I feel like Whenever something is made like this is for guys.

464
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:02,090
Rym: It's usually something that has universal appeal.

465
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:06,023
Rym: But if it's something that's for girls, it's often something really lame.

466
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:06,746
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

467
00:31:06,786 --> 00:31:07,930
Emily: it's like the man show.

468
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:09,870
Emily: Do you remember the man show the man show?

469
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,292
Scott: I like them.

470
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:12,201
Scott: I like the man show before they change the people on.

471
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:14,191
Rym: my mom like the man show a lot more than I Did.

472
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:15,374
Emily: I only saw it once.

473
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:21,430
Emily: it's like girls bouncing around and trampolines like whoo, but it was definitely tongue-in-cheek.

474
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,300
Rym: There's definitely that little bit of a little thing.

475
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,908
Emily: It's like I see all these posters in the subway.

476
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:29,715
Emily: for What the oxygen network.

477
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:32,103
Emily: and it's always like bulging.

478
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,707
Emily: you remember bulging fries.

479
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:41,150
Emily: Oh my god We are fat women who need to lose weight before our wedding and it was just like wrong.

480
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:42,903
Emily: It's so many levels.

481
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:43,830
Emily: It was so bad.

482
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,853
Rym: But then there's the also a dingo a chill baby network Which is nothing.

483
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:53,189
Rym: but I'm a wife and my husband either murdered or stole my kids and I have to get them back.

484
00:31:53,590 --> 00:32:05,010
Scott: It's like I don't watch TV hardly ever but like if I'm at my parents house like sometimes like, you know The spike TV will have like a James Bond marathon and then everyone will watch.

485
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:07,849
Emily: They had by star Star Wars on there a while ago.

486
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:15,648
Scott: Yes, but it's like for everybody but the women like the lifetime channel will never have anything anyone in my house wants to watch ever.

487
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:24,090
Scott: Well, you really well actually there was when I was a kid I would watch like the the supermarket game show on there, you know, I used to watch that too cuz I was really good.

488
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,285
Scott: Yeah, it's like friggin go for the hams.

489
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:26,990
Scott: What's wrong with you?

490
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,613
Scott: You know why?

491
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:27,934
Rym: cuz?

492
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:35,170
Rym: the only people I guess in a traditional household, you know Who goes to the grocery store the wife and the kids?

493
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,370
Rym: So we would have known and the wife would have known but the husband's out like wrestling crocodiles.

494
00:32:39,731 --> 00:32:47,654
Scott: I think the thing is is that labeling a comic for girls or for guys is more sexist than saying just Here's the freaking comic.

495
00:32:47,694 --> 00:32:48,175
Scott: Great.

496
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:52,470
Rym: I said in Japan how many girls just read the comics that are labeled for guys?

497
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,790
Rym: How many guys read the comics labeled for girls?

498
00:32:54,891 --> 00:33:03,795
Rym: Yeah, the real issue is that in America Especially we have this thing where it seems like pot like popular culture maybe outside of geekdom But like normal like the average person.

499
00:33:04,477 --> 00:33:08,330
Rym: if you ask them if sci-fi like what is sci-fi aimed at?

500
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,149
Rym: They'll probably say it's aimed at guys.

501
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:18,946
Rym: I I get this impression that a lot of people think that like Science fiction or anything geeky or anything nerdy is a guy thing and it seems like they love to see.

502
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:28,410
Emily: I feel fantasy is actually I've always had the impression that there are both like nerdy guys and lots and lots and lots of fantasy girls.

503
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:30,378
Rym: Yeah, but I feel like they're two different camps.

504
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:38,047
Rym: like fantasy fantasy for guys is you know, like the woman Jane Melton bikini straddling that stuff is so painful.

505
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:40,632
Rym: I hate that Bristles.

506
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:43,470
Scott: Well, see that's the separate thing that is sort of plagued.

507
00:33:43,951 --> 00:33:49,950
Scott: I guess Japanese and American comics is just the the high quantity of cheesecake all around.

508
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:56,010
Scott: It's just you know, I think that sort of makes it hard for you know, girls and comics in general.

509
00:33:56,151 --> 00:34:00,423
Scott: I think that's sort of why there needs to be like this Almost shoujo kind of.

510
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:01,110
Scott: you know labeling.

511
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:14,340
Scott: This is for girls so that you don't you know, because everything else is horrible cheesecake and it's sort of scary Like you go into like a comic forum and it's like, you know, if people like actually have you know a discussion people be like Yeah, it's a sexist and it's you know crap and whatever.

512
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,848
Scott: but then it's scary how many people they're like Like my cheesecake leave alone.

513
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:21,781
Scott: Or they'll be like, you know, they'll be like every day.

514
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:24,130
Scott: They'll like put up three random comic covers.

515
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:32,648
Scott: It's like vote for which one's the best and I'll be like Oh number two is the best and someone will be like I'd vote for number two But number one has big cleavage and I'm like what the fuck is wrong with you.

516
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:39,989
Emily: Yeah, well must it must sell because they've got like these three hundred dollar figurines in the comic book store of like.

517
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:40,775
Rym: Are they?

518
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:41,601
Rym: are they busts?

519
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:50,022
Emily: But you know, I guess I think of comics.

520
00:34:50,141 --> 00:35:13,669
Emily: I I always associate comics to movies, you know, because they're basically a cross-between Literature like a prose novel and a movie, you know some of my favorite comics almost read like reading a storyboard where they're very cinematic very you know the the shots from Have the same sort of pacing as a as an animated film.

521
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:25,578
Emily: but I guess it's kind of like you take the list of a hundred greatest films ever made and you look at that and Say, okay How many of these are so-called chick flicks?

522
00:35:25,778 --> 00:35:29,569
Emily: or how many of these are so-called gross out cut according to the person who?

523
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:35,856
Rym: emailed us as far as I would imagine that she would rate most of them as Intended for a male audience.

524
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,944
Scott: exactly what the top two are like.

525
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:39,209
Scott: what the Godfather, right?

526
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,057
Scott: That's a guy movie.

527
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:41,983
Scott: It's a mafia movie.

528
00:35:42,003 --> 00:35:43,010
Scott: It's for guys, right?

529
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,993
Scott: Yes, I can go.

530
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:50,033
Rym: the IMDb list didn't see more but you know, well, I'll admit I had actually never heard of the comic She suggested.

531
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,177
Scott: yeah me either.

532
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:56,435
Emily: Well, I've actually looked at skeleton key and I Don't know it doesn't?

533
00:35:56,596 --> 00:35:57,763
Emily: it's one of those manga.

534
00:35:57,803 --> 00:36:01,033
Emily: That doesn't really Strike me.

535
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:01,415
Scott: All right.

536
00:36:01,435 --> 00:36:04,929
Scott: So here's the top of IMDb right now, right?

537
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:07,450
Scott: We got Shawshank Redemption and Godfather tied.

538
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:12,904
Scott: Dark Knight Godfather part two good bad and the ugly pulp fiction Schindler's List.

539
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:13,606
Rym: Well, those

540
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:14,208
Scott: who's nest

541
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:14,590
Emily: that's the.

542
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:19,084
Scott: I know I know but it's like that's like democracy.

543
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:20,348
Emily: You need to do the one.

544
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:20,970
Emily: That's all.

545
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:24,369
Scott: He's not too far off.

546
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:27,530
Scott: Some stuff is far like Dark Knight doesn't belong.

547
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:31,910
Rym: This is always half movies that deserve it and half movies that came out recently.

548
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,589
Rym: But the ones that come out read like Dark Knight is gonna fall off that list within a year to like halfway down.

549
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:50,918
Emily: Yeah, man, city of gods at 18 hot But obviously that's a good movie intended for guys, but like in terms of of comics that That would play well to a female audience.

550
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:56,775
Emily: I mean what exactly do these people who say, you know I want to show Joe novel.

551
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:58,200
Emily: What are they looking for?

552
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,430
Emily: Are they looking for a story with a lot of relationships?

553
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:02,270
Emily: Are they looking?

554
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,505
Emily: You know, are they looking for pretty boys?

555
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:06,410
Emily: Are they looking for?

556
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,260
Emily: You know hearts and sparkles.

557
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,970
Emily: I'm not sure what it is.

558
00:37:11,111 --> 00:37:18,187
Emily: I suppose it varies from person to person But I'm not sure what it is that they want in their comics.

559
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:18,789
Emily: that I don't know.

560
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:24,290
Rym: I have a feeling that these people like her and you know I'm using the person who wrote to us as kind of an example of all of them.

561
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:30,521
Rym: But I feel like they if they go to a panel like this They're expecting to see us showing them.

562
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:33,090
Rym: so you're like super show Joey manga.

563
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:36,141
Rym: Here is the exact equivalent from other countries.

564
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:41,780
Scott: Yeah, that's not the goal of our panel It's you know, I even said that it's like our goal is not to just show you.

565
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:53,102
Scott: Hey, look, here's something that's exactly the same as I don't know What's low but no, I have one of my mind.

566
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:54,165
Emily: what's the what?

567
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:55,510
Emily: I can't read your mind Scott?

568
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:59,324
Scott: The one with the with the four guys and the one that doesn't narrow down?

569
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:00,669
Scott: no, it's like they're like the four.

570
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:06,997
Scott: It is fucking awesome, but it's like.

571
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:10,970
Scott: do you want me to just show you what the you know French honey or a dongle is?

572
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,775
Scott: What's the point of that?

573
00:38:11,835 --> 00:38:14,531
Scott: It's you know, if they're the same thing, they're the same thing Why not?

574
00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:20,428
Scott: point is to show you different things that are not like manga because it's not.

575
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:22,939
Scott: you know You like manga already.

576
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,050
Scott: here are non manga that are the same.

577
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:26,475
Scott: It's you like manga.

578
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:27,960
Scott: You're a comics fan.

579
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:30,630
Scott: Why are you ignoring comics from every other country?

580
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:38,488
Scott: These are good comics from other countries that you will like also if you would just read them and stop only reading things that are from Japan.

581
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:43,125
Rym: Because I can't you know black said everyone seemed really interested in black.

582
00:38:43,145 --> 00:38:44,390
Rym: sad and that's the one you can't get.

583
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:51,487
Emily: Oh my god that's a good comic though people might put be put off because it's anthro and that would be such a shame.

584
00:38:51,527 --> 00:39:00,789
Scott: because I hate when People look at the anthropomorphic comics and go Well, I think that's a good way to push that an anime con where there's more likeliness of acceptance of the anthro.

585
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,570
Scott: then Yeah, actually, I've noticed a lot of French comics tend to go for this answer.

586
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:10,291
Scott: I've been looking at a few more and it's seriously, you know, I tell everybody There's.

587
00:39:10,452 --> 00:39:13,522
Emily: there's the stigma against you know, drawing anything anthro now.

588
00:39:13,623 --> 00:39:15,810
Emily: It's it's been a staple of animation.

589
00:39:16,073 --> 00:39:25,618
Emily: I mean funny animals have been around Mickey Mouse man Bugs bunny attractive Okay, you know, but I mean like look she's like.

590
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:29,470
Scott: I just listened to an interview with the guy who translated dungeon into English.

591
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,430
Scott: You did a show on dungeon, you know way back.

592
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,702
Scott: Yeah dungeon is an anthro right and actually from that show.

593
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:41,541
Scott: I learned about this other French comic called ordinary victories.

594
00:39:41,602 --> 00:39:48,453
Scott: that's from That I've heard it's about the Algerian war and something Historical comics.

595
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:55,929
Rym: Yeah a lot of historical action as we were told by an ambassador a cultural ambassador Who happened to be set up at the New York comic-con last year?

596
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,441
Rym: Basically, he had this booth all by himself and there was.

597
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:02,030
Rym: he had like an assistant and no one was looking at the stuff.

598
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:06,970
Rym: There was just all these French comics and they were basically saying look France has awesome comics.

599
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:25,750
Emily: Seriously it's right cool about because I really like French comics and animation because I feel like they combine you know the serious nature of Japanese comics with a lot of the Emphasis on figure drawing and fine arts that you sometimes find in American animation.

600
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:28,510
Rym: I mean, I spent a good half hour just flipping through these books.

601
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,075
Emily: It's called like in France.

602
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:50,794
Emily: people call it the ninth art and they view comics more as a fine art instead of like The other eight are I don't know like music like paintings sculpt The muses.

603
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:52,259
Emily: I think it's based on the muses.

604
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,089
Emily: so like they have they have Calliope and all that.

605
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:59,763
Scott: but What news goes with with comics?

606
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:06,907
Emily: it's a made-up music Talks in bolded text.

607
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:20,784
Rym: Anyway what I was gonna say is um, I am big centimeter is stupid.

608
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,570
Rym: I know actually it's not that bad.

609
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:28,058
Rym: Yeah, as I was saying The Syrians came down like a wolf on the fold.

610
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:29,163
Rym: their cohorts were gleaming in purple.

611
00:41:29,183 --> 00:41:29,826
Scott: That's enough of that.

612
00:41:29,846 --> 00:41:52,322
Emily: I'm gonna kick you but It when I talked about The the comics we discussed in the beginning of this show I said, you know it we focused a lot more on the less superficial aspects of it like the art Nothing like your stereotypical manga art your your characters.

613
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:55,109
Emily: It doesn't really fit any of the.

614
00:41:55,129 --> 00:42:01,750
Emily: you know The things you would see in the big-eye smallmouth role-playing guide as like sample characters.

615
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,417
Emily: There's no magical girl.

616
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:12,476
Rym: I wonder if even if we'd shown like a super romantic Has a magical girl we talking about Man.

617
00:42:12,516 --> 00:42:13,926
Emily: I love that comic so much.

618
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:18,746
Emily: It's ridiculous I want to make a Scott Pilgrim dating game and runaways has a bunch of magical girls.

619
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:19,690
Emily: Also, that's true.

620
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,176
Rym: Yeah, we talked about runaways too.

621
00:42:21,196 --> 00:42:22,120
Emily: I forgot about that.

622
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,947
Scott: Scrooge McDuck has an evil magical girl.

623
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,502
Emily: Yeah She's not exactly a girl.

624
00:42:26,562 --> 00:42:27,609
Emily: She's more like a hag.

625
00:42:28,734 --> 00:42:31,195
Scott: What a hag is female She's not.

626
00:42:31,456 --> 00:42:34,608
Rym: she's more like I guess watching DuckTales like I remember as a kid.

627
00:42:34,628 --> 00:42:35,130
Rym: I hated her.

628
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,799
Rym: She was evil and horrible, but reading the comic.

629
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,906
Rym: It's more like she's.

630
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:40,889
Rym: I kind of like her.

631
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:48,389
Rym: You feel kind of bad because she's always desperate That she calls them poof bombs and she throws them.

632
00:42:48,613 --> 00:42:57,237
Emily: I Don't know.

633
00:42:57,257 --> 00:43:01,258
Emily: I feel like What I like in my comics.

634
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,890
Emily: is I like good art, right?

635
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:05,396
Emily: But I'm not picky about.

636
00:43:05,476 --> 00:43:07,103
Emily: it has to be a certain kind of art.

637
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:10,681
Emily: It doesn't have to have big eyes It doesn't have to have small noses.

638
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:11,183
Emily: that kind of.

639
00:43:11,204 --> 00:43:24,550
Emily: well, it could be xkcd But it's one thing I'm very very set on is that it's got to have Depth, you know either that or it's got to be hella funny, you know, it could be a total space ghost.

640
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:33,130
Rym: All the comics we talked about are like important like all ages all appeal amazing kind of all ages.

641
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:38,935
Emily: Yeah, I mean, I think I wouldn't give my six-year-old The Dark Knight.

642
00:43:39,176 --> 00:43:44,570
Rym: I totally remember I watched vampire hunter D in the early days of fourth grade.

643
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:50,870
Scott: Your I wouldn't give The Walking Dead to someone who wasn't in like at least middle school.

644
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:52,682
Emily: It would freak kids.

645
00:43:52,743 --> 00:44:00,290
Rym: one of the first real books I ever read was Stephen King's skeleton crew followed shortly thereafter by tales of horror and the macabre a collection of Lovecraft stories.

646
00:44:01,612 --> 00:44:03,460
Scott: It's alright, you know Dark Knight Returns.

647
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,869
Scott: You got to be at least middle of high school or something Runaways, you should be in middle or high school probably.

648
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:19,130
Emily: Yeah It's more like to really relate to this kind of story.

649
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:22,641
Emily: You've got to be above a certain age or a certain maturity level.

650
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:28,730
Scott: Yeah, even reading Scrooge McDuck in elementary school It'd be okay, but you wouldn't really fully get the deal.

651
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:34,181
Rym: Having a multi-layered thing where a kid can watch it and enjoy it.

652
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:38,177
Rym: on one level you're older you have more experience you watch it You enjoy it on this wholly different level.

653
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:52,962
Emily: That's exactly how I was with McDuck because I Collected those comics as a kid and then when Scott got the digest I was just reading it the other day and it's it's like it all comes back to me But I pick up on so many more jokes.

654
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:54,548
Scott: Are you doing Scrooge McDuck?

655
00:44:54,568 --> 00:45:08,630
Scott: That's a guy's Right, he's all rough-and-tumble and mining in Alaska Because we've totally served been riffing on Someone named satellite, you know their email was kind of okay.

656
00:45:08,751 --> 00:45:09,193
Scott: No, I did.

657
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:17,067
Scott: the reply I sent to them was basically, you know We were aware that you know before we did the thing that we weren't really doing any sort of.

658
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:27,815
Scott: you know Stuff that was show Joey in any sort of way, but you know now that I think about it, you know afterwards It's like hey, you know, I look at this list of comics He talked about and you know what?

659
00:45:28,397 --> 00:45:31,769
Scott: I think actually more these are you know appealing to?

660
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:42,510
Scott: Both genders and you know the fact that she said really, you know, watchmen just look at the name Definitely shows that she hasn't read it and doesn't know what she's really.

661
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:51,012
Rym: Yeah, oh my god, I've read watchmen like four times I Don't know.

662
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:54,070
Scott: It's I'm gonna read it again as soon as the hardcover edition shows up.

663
00:45:54,231 --> 00:46:03,750
Rym: actually, they just solicited the international edition of it and I'm like, uh, Well, I just lent it actually cuz one of my co-workers like never really read comics.

664
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:07,665
Rym: He's like a. he does doctoral stuff and he's really into I guess literature.

665
00:46:07,705 --> 00:46:08,267
Scott: He's a doctor.

666
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,050
Scott: He'll understand it.

667
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:10,285
Rym: Well, the thing is it's fun.

668
00:46:10,305 --> 00:46:10,650
Rym: He's mighty.

669
00:46:11,092 --> 00:46:12,276
Rym: He gave a lecture and he was.

00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:16,935
Scott: He never read.

Scott: be a friend that it did know.

673
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:19,270
Rym: and he never said he didn't even know there was a movie.

674
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:23,110
Rym: So when everyone didn't even know there was a movie, no, he just didn't pay attention.

675
00:46:23,211 --> 00:46:27,564
Rym: So all the kids in his class were like, yeah Guy Fawkes Yeah, and they all knew about it.

676
00:46:27,645 --> 00:46:29,214
Rym: and he was like How do you?

677
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:30,281
Rym: and they're like there was a movie?

678
00:46:30,684 --> 00:46:31,610
Rym: and he didn't see the movie.

679
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:36,550
Rym: But then he'd mentioned it to me and I was like, yeah, there's a comic - it's one of the greatest comics ever written.

680
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:40,470
Rym: And then he's like one of you know, what's the best comic ever written?

Rym: So the next day I gave him our copy of Watchmen Yeah, and he read it and he gave it back to me and he said that was interesting Interesting that she gives him civilized news.

682
00:46:50,752 --> 00:46:53,829
Rym: Well, I'm gonna give him V for Vendetta because he specifically wanted it and then I got it.

683
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:57,228
Rym: I was gonna lend him your Dark Knight Returns, but it looks like someone else borrowed it.

684
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:57,690
Rym: I can't find.

685
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:58,133
Scott: Oh, is it?

686
00:46:58,173 --> 00:46:59,483
Scott: I got to add to my board.

687
00:46:59,644 --> 00:47:00,510
Rym: I can't find it anywhere.

688
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:11,070
Scott: Actually, I have I lent my grandma, you know, this this Will Eisner hardcover Which is sort of like the best place to start with Will Eisner and she lost it or something.

689
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,057
Scott: I gotta go buy it again.

690
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:13,730
Rym: She probably lent it to one of her friends.

691
00:47:14,191 --> 00:47:18,144
Scott: I don't know where it is, but I got like the reading circle of all grandmas.

692
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:19,549
Scott: Yeah, I gotta go get it.

693
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:20,335
Emily: So is it?

694
00:47:20,395 --> 00:47:21,709
Emily: is it one of his more?

695
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:23,653
Emily: Slice of life.

696
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:25,901
Scott: Well, all his stuff is slice of life.

697
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:28,249
Rym: Yeah, I thought slice of life was a bad word.

698
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:41,549
Rym: It's like realistic it's gritty it's it's human stories Because anime world order going on and on about oh, it's a slice of life anime.

699
00:47:41,997 --> 00:47:42,610
Scott: Well, there's different.

700
00:47:43,172 --> 00:47:44,917
Scott: I mean the slice of life anime.

701
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:48,569
Scott: at least the ones they're talking about and there are a bunch of them tend to be.

702
00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:54,850
Scott: you Know watch someone's, you know, just everyday happenings, you know, someone goes to school la la la la.

703
00:47:55,294 --> 00:47:56,770
Scott: There's a cat along the way to school.

704
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:02,470
Rym: My 10th grade English teacher literature, you know, he was like the best literature teacher ever.

705
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:06,770
Rym: He was the one who gave me the lively art of writing which is like my Bible when it comes to writing.

706
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:18,533
Rym: But I remember he went on and on about this exact thing and how yeah I think he said slice of life is more often than not a code word for no plot Couldn't think of.

707
00:48:18,694 --> 00:48:28,790
Scott: one wrote the story anyway, but human interest, you know is sort of you know It sort of feels okay to call it slice of life when it because it is a slice of life.

708
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:30,236
Scott: So this is what life is like.

709
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:32,163
Scott: and here's a piece of all stories.

710
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:34,321
Rym: or human interest or no one would read them right No.

711
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:45,510
Scott: But like when someone says human interest story like especially the will Eisner stories and also like the ojihiro tatsumi stories It's like look here is you know something that is you know true?

712
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:59,645
Scott: humanity, you know people real real person in a real horrible situation like a like a homeless guy who had Cardboard blocks blown away or something, you know even worse than that That's like a wussy example because I'm not I can't come up with ones like they do.

713
00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:05,430
Scott: but you know And that's that's what the spirit and all of you know Eisner stuff is all about and tatsumi also is you know.

714
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:12,309
Scott: Look here is you know a horrible horrible real human circumstance and it shows you something about.

715
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:19,978
Scott: you know Human nature and in stark contrast, it's it's rough It's not you know Just someone living their everyday life.

716
00:49:20,078 --> 00:49:30,843
Emily: watch them as they go the end at some random point I feel like Well, we're back on the subject of what is a girl comic what is a guy comic?

717
00:49:31,444 --> 00:49:35,034
Emily: it feels like you're talking about things people can relate to.

718
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:39,088
Emily: seems like all great media books music etc.

719
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:43,829
Emily: is That that's remembered throughout the ages?

720
00:49:44,871 --> 00:50:00,030
Rym: Tends to be things that both genders can relate to to some definitely You know, I just I feel like a lot of people and not just this person will always Lump a lot of things that actually have mass appeal and say that they have male appeal.

721
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:12,726
Emily: Well, you know, there's always my feminist argument that since we live in a Patriarchal society everything is man the patriarchy and the patriarchy and it's cylindrical objects.

722
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:15,258
Scott: Oh No cylinders.

723
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,475
Rym: I You know someone.

724
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:22,570
Rym: I did not come up with this someone else said this but I think it rings very true.

725
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:28,270
Rym: The reason there is so much male phallic imagery in the world is that vaginas are complicated.

726
00:50:30,213 --> 00:50:32,690
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's some Carcassonne tiles that look like.

727
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,715
Emily: I Think we've rebutted that thoroughly.

728
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,439
Rym: Boys and girls do you want more Emily in the show?

729
00:50:57,294 --> 00:51:04,119
Emily: One more thing I want to say in case you're listening girl who wrote the email, I'm sorry We picked on you so much.

730
00:51:04,422 --> 00:51:05,248
Rym: No, we're not.

731
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,730
Scott: But I didn't feel like we were picking on you.

732
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:18,858
Scott: I was mostly just it's sort of like I agreed in a way and that we didn't really mention any comics that are girl Specific.

733
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:29,616
Scott: you brought up a point and we're like, yes, you're right It's like we didn't mention any toys from the Barbie Isle, but I feel most of the things we mentioned You know the vast majority.

734
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:34,853
Scott: you can sort of argue maybe Dark Knight Returns of Sutton if you really wanted to right But that's the least.

735
00:51:35,013 --> 00:51:47,490
Scott: again or tastic exactly the pretty much everything we mentioned is a you know Something that appeals to everyone regardless of gender and I you know, I don't think we really you know.

736
00:51:48,252 --> 00:51:50,319
Scott: Pick you know picked any things that were.

737
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:55,749
Scott: this is for guys and girls won't like it, you know We did but we did a separate panel on that.

738
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:05,410
Emily: Recommendations about comics that I like that have a female perspective.

739
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:09,953
Emily: I really like Queen and Country and White out.

740
00:52:10,354 --> 00:52:11,878
Emily: what's what's that author's name?

741
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:12,520
Scott: Greg Rucka.

742
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,522
Scott: Greg Rucka.

743
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:16,370
Emily: He writes awesome female character.

744
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,173
Rym: Yes, white out.

745
00:52:17,193 --> 00:52:17,855
Rym: Oh my god.

746
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:19,681
Emily: Oh, yeah, they're not.

747
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:22,090
Scott: he also wrote just bad.

748
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:26,685
Scott: He also wrote Gotham Central, which is focus has a police woman, right?

749
00:52:26,805 --> 00:52:36,875
Scott: Yeah, it's mostly about you know There's a. it's basically about all the two different shifts of police officers the night shift in the day shift in Gotham City with a tiny Bit of Batman barely any Batman,

750
00:52:37,296 --> 00:52:37,557
Emily: but it

751
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:46,310
Scott: the Renee Montoya is like the the one of the more Focused on characters that you know, there's a whole bunch of this female and male police woman.

752
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:47,936
Scott: It's like the real police people, you know, it's.

753
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:50,284
Scott: it's it's mixed up properly and such.

754
00:52:50,786 --> 00:52:57,270
Scott: but then I think after that That series is over now, but I think Renee Montoya went on to be like a superhero of some kind or some shit.

755
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:57,752
Scott: I don't know.

756
00:52:57,812 --> 00:52:58,877
Rym: I have my own recommendation.

757
00:52:58,897 --> 00:52:59,680
Rym: There's the classic.

758
00:53:00,142 --> 00:53:07,777
Rym: I was kidnapped by lesbian pirates from outer Before anyone thinks Scott's joking.

759
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,022
Rym: no that comic does rule.

760
00:53:09,062 --> 00:53:09,905
Rym: it's really awesome.

761
00:53:09,965 --> 00:53:11,130
Emily: I thought it was hilarious.

762
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:13,256
Rym: It's like this art and it's just awesome.

763
00:53:13,276 --> 00:53:25,590
Emily: Well, it's like set in the 1950s and it's like a total takeoff of like 1950s sci-fi schlocky comic Like Velma, what are some of the?

764
00:53:25,992 --> 00:53:28,663
Emily: Yeah, it's so funny.

765
00:53:28,684 --> 00:53:29,346
Emily: I love it.

766
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:32,215
Emily: But Yeah stuff like that.

767
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:36,190
Emily: And of course Scott said that the mix line was canceled.

768
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:38,583
Emily: But what I've read of those they're they're decent.

769
00:53:38,624 --> 00:53:39,750
Emily: They're kind of like American.

770
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:43,682
Emily: I like them New York for it's okay.

771
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:52,535
Emily: It was like, you know, all right Some of the girls are kind of they don't show a lot of self-control, but like oh well You're your college.

772
00:53:52,695 --> 00:54:05,182
Scott: I also saw that the so-called plot twist coming about 20 pages New York really?

773
00:54:05,223 --> 00:54:12,310
Scott: Well if you want to read The way they handled it once it happened was sort of bleh, it's like oh, why are you being all like three-year-olds?

774
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,537
Scott: Yeah, you could you could handle this like adults.

775
00:54:14,637 --> 00:54:16,304
Emily: Yeah, just tell them off.

776
00:54:16,364 --> 00:54:17,850
Emily: feel like what the fuck is your problem?

777
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,321
Emily: Okay, that's kind of a spoiler.

778
00:54:19,361 --> 00:54:22,960
Rym: But anyway, whatever Yeah, it's not that much of a spoiler.

779
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:24,629
Rym: We've spoiled worse for less.

780
00:54:25,151 --> 00:54:28,682
Emily: Okay, and Emiko superstar and stuff like that, but that lines canceled.

781
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:28,883
Emily: Bye.

782
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:29,164
Emily: Bye.

783
00:54:29,405 --> 00:54:39,354
Rym: Emiko superstar was also really good Okay, but then again I feel like people who thought anyone who thought that we focused on male oriented oriented comics would have read Emiko superstar and not Thought.

784
00:54:39,374 --> 00:54:40,346
Rym: it was their girly comic.

785
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:48,650
Emily: Maybe who knows they want boys kissing other boys and maybe that will come someday to American comics.

786
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:53,621
Scott: But right now it's boys kissing boys and you can get quite a few of those at the mocha.

787
00:54:53,822 --> 00:54:59,346
Rym: Yeah Not that I would know.
