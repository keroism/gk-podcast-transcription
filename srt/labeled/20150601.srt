00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:16,869
Rym: It's Monday June 1st 2015. my name is Rym my name is Scott, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:21,050
Rym: tonight We're talking about how to figure out how to trust the software that you download.

3
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:24,848
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:32,650
Rym: So far I'm on a streak of one for having no biking anecdotes being in the show.

5
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,790
Scott: We keep this up except is that meta count as an infringement, but meta never counts.

6
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:40,942
Rym: That's what I specifically said, I think was.

7
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:42,169
Rym: I won't talk about fixie guys.

8
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:47,967
Rym: Anyway, the only reason for the help now can't can't can't can't talk can't say anything.

9
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:48,810
Rym: no bikes.

10
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:51,617
Scott: I went to work today for the first time in a while.

11
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:58,628
Scott: I didn't do any work and There was so much netrunner action today news wise that that took up most of my time.

12
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,084
Scott: also Went shopping during lunch and whatnot now.

13
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:15,974
Rym: I've actually I. I spent most of today at work Sitting in a meeting that was useless and then We have a trip to London coming up and like no one booked it because every time I said hey guys Let's book this trip.

14
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:16,837
Rym: No no no let's wait.

15
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:17,238
Rym: Let's wait.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,804
Rym: so finally like today book it.

17
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:26,712
Rym: so I spent the day trying to book a flight to and from London like the week after next and Of course now.

18
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:29,925
Rym: It's too late, so I'm dropping like three grand for this trip.

19
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:31,879
Scott: It's not your three grand No, it's not.

20
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,466
Scott: so it gives a.

21
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:33,432
Rym: well I've been.

22
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:38,350
Rym: I have an interest in the company such that a percentage of that three grand is actually my three grand.

23
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:43,775
Scott: Yeah, but I mean okay, so even if you did it well and in months in advance It would have been what two grand.

24
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,480
Rym: no like eight or nine hundred.

25
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,692
Rym: like flights to London are not expensive if you book him in Advance.

26
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:50,077
Scott: I've been to spend three grand.

27
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:50,559
Scott: may as well.

28
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,462
Scott: just spend six grand.

29
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:52,165
Scott: go first class.

30
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,976
Rym: first class is like 11,000 business class.

31
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:56,321
Rym: I could get for about four or five.

32
00:01:56,803 --> 00:02:00,071
Scott: just go for it full full 11,000.

33
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:02,139
Scott: You don't have to pay and some of you get to sit.

34
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:02,802
Rym: no they would know.

35
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:12,149
Rym: so a co-worker at one point did Book just business class without asking anyone And it was like eight grand and there was some drama because of that because no one's ever done that before.

36
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:17,910
Rym: I Mean I booked business class when I get it like cheaper than economy because of that cool way to her thing.

37
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:23,404
Rym: But anyway the problem I ran into is I use kayak usually because they're actually like.

38
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:23,986
Rym: they're not like.

39
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,210
Rym: all those sites are not great.

40
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:29,290
Rym: But of all those sites that one's actually been pretty oak like it's worked out for me.

41
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,430
Scott: I mean all the sites work the price lines the kayaks yeah, but they all suck also.

42
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:43,322
Rym: Yeah for various reasons, but something to happen this time They must have changed something because I searched and I was like oh It's like a grand like these aren't so bad.

43
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:50,674
Rym: so I pick a flight I'm like all right cool And I go to book it and then you know it always takes you to like the actual place You're gonna book from there.

44
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:55,110
Rym: hidden fees no no it took me to this place called edreams that I'd never heard of.

45
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:58,310
Rym: So all right like fine.

46
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:02,468
Rym: I mean I've booked on shady ass like things like that before and it's my.

47
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:02,830
Scott: is there?

48
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:04,069
Scott: Why does there even exist?

49
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,118
Scott: I mean I understand the purpose of kayak is to like search.

50
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:16,270
Scott: all the different airlines together route to to you know Aggregate, but when you click buy shouldn't it always take you to the official website of the air?

51
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,647
Rym: Because that price is usually through someone else who either bought or has a way to buy or an insurance or something.

52
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:25,477
Scott: those places should Legally be permitted to exist.

53
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:26,582
Rym: you know how we could fix that.

54
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:36,162
Scott: imagine if you went down to the grocery store And there's the grocery store And they have apples and there's a guy in front of the grocery store And you can't go in the grocery store and get an apple.

55
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:36,805
Rym: he comes out was like.

56
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:40,285
Rym: Oh you want to buy an apple I'll be right back, and he comes out goes in the grocery store.

57
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:43,127
Scott: He waits in line He buys the apple and then he sells the Apple to you.

58
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,419
Scott: So like fuck you.

59
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,970
Rym: There's an easy way to make that happen.

60
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:51,263
Rym: We would just have to have laws and then also trade agreements.

61
00:03:51,564 --> 00:04:00,470
Rym: that said any airline Must publish in a standardized format all of their prices at all times for all of their offerings.

62
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,721
Rym: Full-stop fuck you mm-hmm.

63
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,670
Rym: that would make that middle layer disappear.

64
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,588
Scott: How about all businesses that sell products to the public directly as opposed to b2b?

65
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:11,596
Scott: Must publish?

66
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,070
Rym: nope then I'd be an airline, and I wouldn't sell to the public.

67
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,327
Rym: I'd only sell b2b to one of those shady people in the middle.

68
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,353
Scott: Why would what?

69
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:19,257
Scott: how does it benefit you?

70
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:22,089
Rym: I can obfuscate everything internally and still do price discrimination.

71
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:24,838
Rym: I mean, there's a lot of new prices.

72
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:27,767
Scott: Why don't you just do price discrimination to make it fucking public?

73
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:30,709
Scott: just be like yes I'm discriminating prices what you can do about it.

74
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,781
Rym: So I watched a co-worker booking flights somewhere else and they opened this.

75
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:43,710
Rym: they searched for the same flight on the same service in Chrome Firefox and ie all in the equivalent of incognito and got radically different prices.

76
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:45,718
Rym: And we could.

77
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:46,282
Rym: we tested it.

78
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:47,350
Rym: it was based on browser.

79
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:50,520
Scott: Is user agents to try different OS's?

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,683
Rym: yeah, so you know what I figured out.

81
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:55,054
Rym: if you're on if you're using Internet Explorer And you try to buy plane tickets.

82
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,638
Rym: They just give you worse prices.

83
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:58,163
Rym: I guess they think you're dumb enough to take them.

84
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:06,848
Rym: okay anyway, so Then I get to this payment portal that asks for PayPal or a credit card warning.

85
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:09,088
Rym: sign number one Morning, so number two.

86
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:12,462
Rym: That's weird for a for booking a flight.

87
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:14,390
Scott: I wouldn't use PayPal to book a flight.

88
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,915
Scott: I mean most places online.

89
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:17,099
Scott: let you choose your payment method.

90
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:17,962
Rym: yeah, but it's still so.

91
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:21,909
Rym: I pick credit card and then Amex is not an option.

92
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:24,517
Scott: Amex is usually not an option not for flights.

93
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:28,648
Rym: every airline takes Amex because that's what every corporate credit card for travel is.

94
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:29,190
Scott: that's true.

95
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:31,090
Scott: It is weird for a travel related business.

96
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,055
Rym: So I look at it, and I think well I could book anyway on my own credit card And then just get the reimbursement.

97
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:45,970
Rym: no that'd be fine because I'm not giving my credit card to shady Back and I'd use a Google wallet for it, so I'd be safe okay, so that would have been fine.

98
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:55,449
Rym: But then I think a second and I type a dreams into Google And all the results are this place fucking fucked me.

99
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:56,736
Scott: How did they fuck?

100
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,387
Scott: you bought a ticket and you didn't actually get a ticket.

101
00:05:58,407 --> 00:05:58,810
Scott: bought a ticket?

102
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,301
Rym: They charged me twice, and then they disappeared and never gave me the ticket.

103
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,770
Rym: like crazy egregious bullshit.

104
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,779
Scott: How come the government isn't arrested whoever?

105
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,225
Rym: that's what a lot of people are wondering.

106
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:09,250
Rym: this is a recent thing.

107
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:13,567
Scott: so then I go I set up something shady like that and see how long it goes before we get busted.

108
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:21,060
Rym: yeah, so then I go back in a kayak and basically Every result for like the first three pages.

109
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,732
Rym: if you sort by cheapest is this edreams fake site Mm-hmm.

110
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,094
Scott: How did?

111
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,643
Scott: why don't you contact kayak and say hey you should remove?

112
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,068
Rym: I tweeted at them no response.

113
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,778
Rym: I emailed them no response.

114
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:34,247
Scott: What kind of money is kayak just getting?

115
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:36,254
Scott: like the Commission Payment?

116
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,029
Rym: there must be something going on like that.

117
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:50,350
Rym: But I mean like they have all their similarly shady things there before like all sites do but like edream seems to be literally this Listen, I would just basically suck it up and pay the extra money to just go directly to the airlines.

118
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:51,936
Rym: Yeah, that's what I did.

119
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,909
Scott: even if I'm getting ripped off because maybe there's some reseller I can go to and get a lower price.

120
00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:03,578
Scott: I just go directly to the airlines website and buy the ticket because at least then I can trust yeah I just went directly to Delta.

121
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:08,450
Rym: actually the one nice thing that worked out is because the ticket is so Expensive because it's last-minute or whatever.

122
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:14,390
Rym: You get extra air miles based on how much you paid for the ticket, but they're my air miles not the companies.

123
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:26,688
Rym: I never understood why Individual people always get the air miles when companies buy the ticket because otherwise if I didn't get the air miles I would be a lot less willing to travel for work.

124
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,479
Scott: If I was a company I would keep all those fucking.

125
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:30,703
Rym: there's been lawsuits about that.

126
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,790
Rym: actually there have been like companies really can't do.

127
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:36,600
Scott: Really yeah, that's interesting cuz they're the ones paying.

128
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,846
Rym: yeah, so those are a separate thing.

129
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:42,739
Rym: no there are Corporate air miles accounts that do things.

130
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,289
Rym: There's the problem is every airline thing.

131
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:47,749
Rym: That's let's do a Thursday show on air miles.

132
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,614
Rym: I got a lot to say.

133
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:58,459
Rym: I get a lot to say because I have air miles with like eight different fucking air miles things I have the most with Turkish air.

134
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,390
Rym: I have like seven or eight thousand that are far away.

135
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:02,983
Rym: Yeah anyway.

136
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:05,497
Rym: So I guess it's Monday's.

137
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,482
Rym: we got some tech news.

138
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:07,929
Scott: It's so much tech news right now.

139
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,545
Rym: Yep, so what we're trying here is we're gonna.

140
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:13,609
Scott: We're basically We're out of Monday topics.

141
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:26,947
Rym: We've run out of Monday topics that either don't require that either like we can do without doing some research like topics that we don't know enough about to talk for 45 minutes on without research or Rehashing something we've already done just with like.

142
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:29,857
Rym: oh What's changed in the last 10 years since we did that show?

143
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:35,315
Scott: and the thing is change in tech recently hasn't been as Dramatic.

144
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:37,429
Rym: processors aren't that much faster, right?

145
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,157
Scott: There haven't been crazy new developments.

146
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:46,648
Scott: the things that are crazy new developments like aren't available to the public yet and or there's not much to say about or whatever.

147
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:50,484
Scott: and You know there was so much to talk about because he started GeekNights.

148
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:51,630
Scott: We hadn't talked about anything.

149
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:54,441
Rym: Yeah, so we were like let's do a show on NTP.

150
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,450
Rym: Let's do a show on how hard drives work.

151
00:08:57,193 --> 00:08:58,138
Rym: There was a lot of shows.

152
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,572
Scott: so we got 10 years where the shows out of that It's like well hard drives still they changed to SSDs I guess.

153
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:07,642
Rym: I guess we haven't done a show on how SSDs work have we?

154
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:08,606
Rym: or like hybrids.

155
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,349
Rym: I don't think so.

156
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:15,689
Rym: We did a show on raid, but even raid is kind of obsolete like prop algorithms usually better.

157
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:20,423
Rym: Yeah, desktop Daz versus NAS Daz is coming back.

158
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:22,249
Scott: It's like even all that would be one show.

159
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:33,582
Rym: okay Yep, but anyway, and we've done tech news roundups where we just do like 15 tech news's and you know It's basically this week in tech but without What that show in garbage?

160
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:34,749
Rym: Yeah that show.

161
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:42,390
Scott: Yeah, anyway people who know more about actual technology instead of you know enough about technology to work with technology and not just be journalists.

162
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:45,897
Rym: yep, but We're trying something a little different.

163
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:58,249
Rym: now what we're gonna do unless one of you has a better idea is Find a tech news that actually has like an underlying topic That's worthy of discussion and do like what two of those or one of those as the main part of the show.

164
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:03,148
Scott: Because sometimes it's a tech news that we can just go on and on about because there's something going on in it.

165
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,095
Rym: yep So we're so we're trying that.

166
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:09,329
Rym: it's like halfway between a tech news roundup and a regular GeekNights.

167
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:10,374
Rym: Monday We're gonna try this format.

168
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:11,802
Scott: There is so much tech news right now.

169
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:13,130
Scott: Why don't we discuss that yeah?

170
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,870
Rym: So uh I got a tech news too because Scott used to always complain when we were doing the show.

171
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,070
Rym: It's like a room that tech news you have isn't a tech news.

172
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,239
Scott: well, it's so much tech news out.

173
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,967
Scott: there is actually just either business news or Political news that is somehow related to technology.

174
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:41,006
Scott: for example Oh this tech companies got bought as IPO in is VCs invested in this and it's like that's business business news about a tech company right?

175
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:41,688
Scott: or you know?

176
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:50,216
Scott: oh Right now for example there was just a Supreme Court decision today about a guy making threats on Facebook And you know what that's legal news.

177
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:53,546
Scott: It just happened to be that it somehow involved Facebook.

178
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:54,790
Scott: that doesn't make it tech news.

179
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,495
Scott: It's not about technology.

180
00:10:56,876 --> 00:11:01,530
Scott: technology touches every part of our lives in this society that we live in in the West.

181
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:12,105
Scott: Therefore you could if you were so loosey-goosey in your definition consider everything is tech news Even just you know yep, but you can't.

182
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,136
Rym: so I have a Legit real tech news here.

183
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:19,970
Rym: a very specific thing and let's see how much you guys care about it.

184
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,693
Rym: Not at all.

185
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:25,250
Rym: so I knew about half of what's going on in this and Scott knew the rest cuz he actually writes code.

186
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:34,250
Rym: really so so MSV CRT is that thing that you download in Windows to make some programs just work.

187
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:40,962
Scott: You'll see Time, but you know basically on time RT.

188
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:43,270
Scott: I think yeah, I don't know what it stands for exactly.

189
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,253
Scott: Application.

190
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:48,408
Rym: they get an MSV CRT error in their computer.

191
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:48,930
Rym: blue screens.

192
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:50,370
Scott: They don't know why doesn't blue screen?

193
00:11:50,430 --> 00:12:00,710
Scott: But basically someone else out there has Visual Studio And they write a program in C, and they want that program to run on your computer, but you need some libraries.

194
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:05,450
Rym: That is the majority cause of blue screens in old days that DLL blue screens.

195
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,321
Scott: Okay, you need some libraries and for some reason.

196
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:10,450
Scott: They don't just fucking include these things in Windows.

197
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:21,870
Scott: So you need to get this MSV CRT C library thing installed so that The person's program that they wrote in C in Visual Studio will run on your Windows computer.

198
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:24,030
Scott: Why don't they just include these libraries in Windows?

199
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:32,315
Rym: I don't know anyway, so there's a bug if you use that and you use Min GW.

200
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:44,543
Scott: so Min GW is sort of a similar kind of thing But you're in a scenario where you have a Windows computer, and you've got a program written in C for Linux type machines right?

201
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:47,615
Scott: or GNU machines You know could be BSDs.

202
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:48,980
Scott: you know Unix is whatever.

203
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:54,196
Scott: so for example you got W get you get the source code you want to Compile it and run it on Windows.

204
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:57,850
Scott: Min GW is sort of the thing that gets that done.

205
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:08,814
Rym: So it turns out if you're using Min GW and depending on a bunch of other factors Here, I'll read the article because they give a pretty good Explanation.

206
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:12,390
Rym: so let's say that you need accurate floating-point numbers more accurate than usual.

207
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,563
Rym: And you have decided to use the long double data type for extra precision already.

208
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:20,384
Rym: We've lost all the Python programmers and me.

209
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:30,238
Rym: So you're using this long double and then after you do a bunch of calculations you print your number to look at it for Troubleshooting like whatever to your shock.

210
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:31,381
Rym: I love this article.

211
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:34,810
Rym: instead of the number being one two three dot four five six seven eight nine.

212
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:46,049
Rym: It is printed out as negative six point five one eight four two seven times ten to the 264th or Two point seven four five five six three depending on your specific computer, right?

213
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,520
Scott: Well, I mean it could be Big Endian or Little Endian.

214
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:50,510
Scott: right this is due to a bug.

215
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,646
Rym: It could be two's complement in some versions of Min GW G plus plus.

216
00:13:55,726 --> 00:14:06,810
Rym: four point eight point one Where That library still uses MSV CRT for some of its functions like print, right?

217
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:31,890
Scott: Well, I mean usually when you are running something cross-platform you and you have a light, you know And something's written for a library a but the platform you're on has library B. what you'll do is you'll just make a new version of library a. That is supposed to look like the original library as far as the application is concerned But really you replace the contents of some of its functions with wrappers around the local system library.

218
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:50,690
Rym: Now that's actually something I'm very familiar with because one of my first big IT Projects when I worked at IBM and was like just working at places for real was using wine and tools like it To make crufty old Windows applications run in Linux to make thin terminal, right?

219
00:14:50,690 --> 00:15:02,749
Scott: So for example, I write a program on Linux and I you know Import this library the printing the standard input/output library and then I go standard input/output library dot print Okay, great.

220
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:10,730
Scott: And then on the Linux machine obviously there that library exists and it contains the code to execute when someone wants to print something.

221
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:15,850
Scott: So now I want to take that code that I wrote and run it on Windows, but Windows doesn't have that library.

222
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:21,590
Scott: So we need to install a library that looks like that standard input/output library that was on the Linux machine.

223
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,530
Scott: But obviously we just take the code from the original library and bring it over to Windows.

224
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:27,910
Scott: It's not gonna work because printing works differently.

225
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:38,447
Scott: So we'll take that original library and we'll change it around to the inside of the print function actually says oh Yeah, go find the windows print function and use that.

226
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:41,690
Scott: Yep So so now my original code is untouched.

227
00:15:41,911 --> 00:15:52,888
Scott: You can compile it against this phony library and then the phony library when my program Calls the code in that library will then call the code in the windows library, which will then actually print things.

228
00:15:53,209 --> 00:16:00,808
Rym: So MS V CR T's runtime reserves 80 bits for double and long double 80 bits.

229
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:02,815
Scott: Wouldn't it just be 128 bits?

230
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:18,012
Rym: It's 80 bits min GW When it uses when it uses MSV CRT 64-bit thing right print this out Interprets it using the first 64 bits Isn't?

231
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:18,312
Scott: I mean?

232
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:22,062
Rym: I know this discrepancy causes quote garbage results to be output.

233
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:25,981
Scott: isn't a 64-bit machine and and regular old integers supposed to be 64 bits.

234
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,049
Rym: Microsoft C++ runtime library reserves 80 bits for double and long double.

235
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:34,739
Scott: Shouldn't a long double be even more than a double fuck?

236
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:39,375
Rym: if I know I've write Java and Python I don't write.

237
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,747
Scott: or I mean on the 64-bit machines.

238
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:48,250
Scott: are the C Compilers still considering a regular int to be 32-bit just to be nice and then doubles become 64?

239
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,397
Scott: But then wouldn't a long double be 128?

240
00:16:50,397 --> 00:16:52,183
Rym: maybe a long double is 80 for some are like.

241
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:52,985
Rym: I honestly don't know.

242
00:16:53,527 --> 00:17:08,219
Rym: Okay, so That is some tech news now one That is also the difference between someone with a classical computer science degree versus like software engineering or IT Like CS people learn that kind of stuff.

243
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,230
Scott: also a more than nobody in the world gives a fuck about this.

244
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,069
Scott: Cuz who the hell is compiling?

245
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,512
Scott: Who's doing this?

246
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:20,856
Rym: only the weirdest people the same people who use like Cygwin legitimately On top of min GW, yes.

247
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:28,393
Rym: So the people who run Cygwin and then run applications in Cygwin as their primary desktop Yeah, they're having trouble.

248
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:31,161
Scott: They're having trouble right now with some of their fancier programs.

249
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,910
Scott: Yeah, I need high precision floating-point numbers.

250
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:38,438
Rym: So this actually fuck Fuck fuck.

251
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:42,534
Rym: one of my developers actually might have You know what?

252
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:43,538
Rym: This is gonna sound crazy.

253
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:45,566
Rym: This might explain an issue.

254
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,510
Scott: all your shit is Java.

255
00:17:47,332 --> 00:18:01,853
Rym: No, there's some CC plus plus stuff that has JNI connections are using Minji W One of the development environments probably is I'll bet there's a unit test that I see only matters if it compiling against those libraries I'm gonna go look at.

256
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,241
Scott: I mean someone just you know, you know already.

257
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,067
Rym: is I mean abandon?

258
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:09,840
Rym: all hope you use You're using long doubles up to got abandon.

259
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,366
Rym: I'll hope you use JNI.

260
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:16,330
Rym: Okay, JNI That's how you basically have a C++ program interfacing directly with Java.

261
00:18:17,151 --> 00:18:18,377
Scott: Wouldn't you just use some?

262
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:21,030
Scott: I mean if I had I don't like you wouldn't what?

263
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,105
Scott: wouldn't you just use some sort of data interchange like a database or a file?

264
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:35,834
Rym: or JNI is the web service as a way for managed code written in Java to interact with native code written in C plus plus or C or A named pipe?

265
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,149
Scott: or you know, just why do you need the programs like directly call each other?

266
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:48,730
Rym: Necessary are the two answers I have for you one old people or two vague discussion.

267
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:54,784
Scott: Is this so that a Java program can call a function in a C library basically?

268
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,330
Scott: or a C program can call a function?

269
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:58,210
Scott: It is written job.

270
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:04,707
Rym: So Java code running inside of a JVM can call and be called by native applications written like both ways.

271
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:10,488
Scott: Yes You should just use something to go between like a database or a message queue or anything.

272
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:20,768
Rym: So actually there's a. there's a decent performance case for doing it this way Involving the libraries that already exist to do network capture are pretty much all written in C C++.

273
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,710
Scott: Alright, well then you shouldn't be writing in Java.

274
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:38,550
Scott: You should be writing the parts that don't need to be C for performance reasons and ease of writing reasons in Python Which can natively directly call C. Yeah, well and don't need to have this weird JVM and J and I getting in the way I'm tired of and don't like Java.

275
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,357
Rym: I'll put it that way.

276
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:39,458
Rym: You

277
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,023
Scott: don't say yeah

278
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:58,433
Rym: increasingly tired of Java, but the main point of me making this my news is one that is an example of actual tech news and - if you want to go into computer science, like you're in high school like a lot of our listeners computer science You'll learn what that is,

279
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:01,501
Scott: even though technically that isn't even really.

280
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,564
Scott: I mean, it's programming.

281
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:08,101
Scott: but computer science is actually like language parsing And all kinds of other.

282
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:17,864
Rym: like if you have a computer science degree You'll understand the story much more readily than a lot of people I know who would have software engineering or IT or other computer.

283
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:19,509
Rym: yet degrees, okay.

284
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,270
Rym: So anyway, you got any news?

285
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,795
Rym: I Forgot don't you?

286
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:26,121
Rym: you forgot what your news was?

287
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,870
Rym: You didn't link it to me yet either.

288
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:29,342
Rym: No, there's the last thing you sent me.

289
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:30,290
Rym: is that hipster dice thing.

290
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,464
Scott: There's so much tech news going down right now that it's hard to even keep it all under control.

291
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,267
Scott: You didn't know G+?

292
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:38,815
Rym: Oh Yeah, that's that's your tech news.

293
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:40,360
Scott: There's that's right the Google thing.

294
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,740
Rym: There was so much Google and any rabbit from the book club book Any rabbit any is the main one?

295
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:48,530
Scott: All right one more big wig is the second.

296
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:51,262
Scott: Yeah, anyway might as well just take the easy path.

297
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:52,629
Scott: why should I go for the hard ones?

298
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,897
Scott: yeah Silver there you go.

299
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:55,200
Scott: Okay.

300
00:20:55,603 --> 00:20:56,127
Scott: There's a hard one.

301
00:20:56,207 --> 00:21:00,780
Scott: All right, so Google had mad announcements their Google iOS and whatnot.

302
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,797
Scott: They announced some Android M, which I don't I didn't even read about it yet I just saw headlines.

303
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:05,583
Scott: I don't even know what it is.

304
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:15,850
Rym: There's good stuff in there But I can't talk about it cuz I don't even know I'm gonna do a dedicated news about it But I didn't want to do it today because that is newer than the stuff that I wanted to bring up today.

305
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:19,666
Scott: What I did find what I do know about is Google Photos, right.

306
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:23,950
Scott: so Google Photos Solves a few photo related problems, right?

307
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,928
Scott: The problem a lot of people have is taking a lot of freaking photos these days with your phone cameras.

308
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:37,210
Scott: Yep, and You know, we've had for a while say, you know Even the Google+ app would automatically look in your phone's photo library.

309
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:39,767
Scott: Take all those photos and put them up on Google+.

310
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:44,110
Rym: You know where they would be safe, but then it was like hard to make a library to share them.

311
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,193
Rym: There were limits.

312
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:48,644
Scott: There's all kinds of weird stuff right every phone were like auto upload stuff.

313
00:21:48,664 --> 00:21:54,821
Scott: So now the new Google Photos Smartly organizes for these photos based on things.

314
00:21:54,902 --> 00:22:04,130
Scott: so it's like oh I see that you went on a trip To you know based on the IP the geolocation and all these photos are taken in this other place where you don't live.

315
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:08,443
Scott: But during this week, let's group those all together in trip to place.

316
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,687
Rym: I've been doing that for a while.

317
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:22,250
Scott: I love that Yep, so it's doing that for you, but mostly the thing is they're giving everyone free Unlimited photo storage with photos up to a certain size, you know in megapixels or megabits or whatever.

318
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:31,161
Scott: So as long as the photos your phone takes are lower resolution and lower file size and JPEG Then this limit it will automatically.

319
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:36,650
Scott: now, you know in the new Google Photos app Which is separate from G+ G+ is slowly being phased out.

320
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:40,704
Scott: Store those for you forever used that to pay.

321
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:51,669
Scott: if you hit a certain storage limit You still can pay in which case they'll let you have images of any size You know full resolution whatever and store as many as your pay to store.

322
00:22:52,757 --> 00:23:00,929
Scott: the thing is is People are acting like oh Google you have saved us, you know on our photo storage woes liquor has been.

323
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:02,750
Scott: Well, okay.

324
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:14,965
Scott: So first of all flicker for as long as I've been using it Which is since college is like 25 bucks a year and it still is for unlimited ever for unlimited everything full resolution everything.

325
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:17,654
Scott: so Flicker is already the king.

326
00:23:17,674 --> 00:23:23,010
Rym: but flicker was way behind for a while on like an app on your phone that works.

327
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,099
Rym: Integration with other systems.

328
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,529
Scott: Yeah now they've got that under control pretty do.

329
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:31,226
Scott: now It's pretty much that and Google Photos pretty much the same.

330
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:31,830
Scott: in this regard.

331
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,116
Scott: Amazon also is Amazon Photos.

332
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:35,360
Scott: Guess what that does.

333
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,250
Scott: also the same goddamn thing for a small annual fee.

334
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,550
Scott: Yeah, unlimited storage full resolution and whatever.

335
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:48,098
Scott: I think what's interesting is also Apple has iCloud which I think is a little bit more expensive But also does the same exact.

336
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:56,857
Rym: so I pulled a bunch of people who aren't like as tuned into this as we are Just kind of at working around and the general sentiment is Everyone likes like.

337
00:23:56,877 --> 00:23:58,644
Rym: they know what flicker is, but they're quote.

338
00:23:58,824 --> 00:23:59,728
Rym: I'm not a photographers.

339
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:00,269
Rym: I don't use it.

340
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:05,363
Rym: They love g+ because suddenly it just works because they take pictures and it's all already set up.

341
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:10,120
Rym: and the people who use iPhones hate iPhoto Absolutely hate iPhoto.

342
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,210
Scott: iPhoto is no good.

343
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:19,693
Scott: Yeah, but you if you're just using the built-in camera app, right the iCloud photo store thing, you know I don't use iPhoto.

344
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:22,401
Scott: but for example, you know, you couldn't.

345
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:28,049
Scott: Apple the you know, the annoying Apple software updater That's always on your Windows computer trying to get upgrade iTunes all the time.

346
00:24:28,612 --> 00:24:41,590
Scott: It always wants you to install this iCloud garbage and I just say do it to make it shut up and it doesn't bother Me, but I actually use one function of it Which is take a photo on your iPhone and it's automatically an iCloud just automatically no matter what?

347
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,530
Scott: Then you can go to the Windows computer and there's a folder that is iCloud photos.

348
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,110
Scott: You click on it and there's all the photos that are on your phone.

349
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,764
Scott: Yeah, you don't need to like do a transfer or anything like that.

350
00:24:50,804 --> 00:24:51,709
Scott: Just there they are.

351
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:55,250
Scott: I was gonna use, you know flicker Google+ or Amazon.

352
00:24:55,631 --> 00:25:06,870
Scott: I would have to go to flickers website or go to the Google+ which isn't that much harder But then I have to download the photo onto the computer Which I guess is still happening when you go to the iCloud photo, right?

353
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,590
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's just it's right there in the Windows Explorer.

354
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,030
Scott: I can drag it right from there into this Photoshop as it saves me a whole step.

355
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,525
Rym: I mean if I just say anything about this g+ thing, it's a victory.

356
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:21,163
Scott: Well, it's not g+ anymore That's the news of it.

357
00:25:21,284 --> 00:25:21,870
Scott: All right, right.

358
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:28,921
Scott: In fact, you know how when you search on Google if you search for a person often You'll see like their Google+ profiles like above the results.

359
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:30,607
Scott: They were starting to remove that.

360
00:25:30,627 --> 00:25:31,390
Scott: It's getting phased out.

361
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:35,790
Rym: Yeah, Google+ is disappearing even though I've started using it more and more lately.

362
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:40,110
Scott: Oh, there are you know, it's weird because it's sort of in the RPG communities.

363
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:43,968
Scott: Oh, there are a lot of communities that are on there and using Google+.

364
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,357
Scott: So if they really just hose it.

365
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,527
Scott: it's not like when they host Google Wave and not a tier with shed.

366
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:53,622
Rym: Yeah Anyway, but we'll see this.

367
00:25:53,642 --> 00:26:06,026
Rym: I want to talk about this separately because Photography workflows if you have multiple devices that take photos like there it's a complicated mess of what's backed up where and when and all that kind of stuff.

368
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,289
Rym: and like what's your record?

369
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,069
Rym: like How do you share the photos?

370
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:16,354
Rym: And I feel like for all the casual photos that I take basically everything I take on my phone G+ like.

371
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:24,142
Rym: well, I keep saying G+ the new Google Photos thing has a Pretty compelling UX compared to all the other ways.

372
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:26,450
Scott: Yeah, I just use a whole bunch of them all at once.

373
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,230
Rym: Yep, guys, there's something with that was when it wasn't unlimited.

374
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,137
Rym: Yeah, you know your Google Drive space.

375
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:34,328
Scott: any one of them dies or has a problem or whatever.

376
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,471
Scott: It's like I don't care I mostly.

377
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,944
Scott: just you know, I don't use flicker and I use Lightroom.

378
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,670
Scott: I don't use any of the other things.

379
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,144
Scott: Yeah, I just you know, like the Amazon is just like.

380
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,857
Scott: I just let it be Yep, and if I ever need it is there.

381
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:46,600
Rym: but here's the difference.

382
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,972
Rym: letting Google just be before was filling up your Google Drive That's true.

383
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:50,434
Scott: Now.

384
00:26:50,836 --> 00:26:52,181
Rym: It's not literally just let it be.

385
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:54,670
Rym: So the great thing is now independent of the workflow.

386
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:55,759
Rym: Have you got an Android phone?

387
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,030
Scott: I mean, this is way bigger news for you.

388
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:08,214
Rym: Oh, yeah, if I have an Android phone now, it's great because every photo I take over like is immediately uploaded as fast as possible to both flicker and Google.

389
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:09,645
Scott: this is mostly big news for the people.

390
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:11,854
Scott: the Android phone Smash my phone.

391
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:15,905
Rym: There are two copies of that photo on two different services.

392
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:16,266
Rym: Yep.

393
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:17,990
Rym: That's that's what's important.

394
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:26,944
Rym: It's very important things of the day.

395
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:30,270
Rym: I was a big fan of Seinfeld as was Scott when we were younger.

396
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:32,245
Rym: Doesn't hold up that?

397
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:35,144
Scott: well The laugh track really is the thing that makes it not hold up.

398
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:36,190
Rym: laugh track is like a punch.

399
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:42,190
Scott: I think if they got rid of the laugh track It would probably have some sort of weird emptiness to it.

400
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:48,797
Scott: That would also be problematic, you know in like the all the pauses for the laugh track, but Other than that it would.

401
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,590
Scott: it's actually good if it not for the laughter.

402
00:27:50,632 --> 00:27:50,742
Scott: Yep.

403
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:55,730
Rym: So what happened like when I show people like Emily who have never really seen Seinfeld what instead of like saying?

404
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,874
Rym: Oh, let's watch a random episode.

405
00:27:57,316 --> 00:28:01,130
Rym: I've kind of decided to curate it cuz they're like 10 or 15 memorable episodes.

406
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:07,377
Scott: Yeah There are episodes like the high concept episodes like the parking garage Chinese restaurant rager.

407
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:14,600
Rym: Yeah, like though the holes the holes Yeah, the You know, yeah, there's about right there.

408
00:28:14,681 --> 00:28:16,047
Rym: It's basically like that whole.

409
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:19,642
Scott: Yeah So but there's a lot of episodes that are just like.

410
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:21,530
Scott: alright, it's another Seinfeld episode.

411
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:22,393
Rym: So I saw this.

412
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:23,438
Rym: or also it's just like.

413
00:28:23,498 --> 00:28:28,601
Rym: it's interesting because the show is really funny to me as a kid Having never lived in or even been to New York.

414
00:28:29,284 --> 00:28:34,424
Rym: now that I live in New York The show has a whole nother level of wow.

415
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,210
Rym: That's actually way too real.

416
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,364
Scott: It was actually very surprising when the show was new.

417
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:45,713
Scott: how like Globally universally popular it was when it was so New York It is like.

418
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:50,730
Scott: so that would be like if people who didn't play video games are laughing at penny arcades.

419
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:54,650
Rym: Yeah, of course nowadays penny arcade actually probably is funny to a lot of people that don't play a lot of it.

420
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,220
Scott: I mean some of it but you still get it's crazy.

421
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,521
Scott: Yeah,

422
00:28:57,983 --> 00:29:10,890
Rym: so this is a little mini article Someone put together about the fourth wall in the set meaning that in the whole run of the show Jerry had an apartment and then They changed it once a little bit like they got rid of that bike and stuff hanging in the background.

423
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,824
Rym: Yeah, like they moved that background bedroom area because they used to show a bathroom.

424
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:17,572
Rym: Mm-hmm or and then What?

425
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:22,710
Rym: basically someone showed that there's a wall that you never saw in the yeah to the right of the kitchen.

426
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:24,920
Scott: Yep, because no they never looked to the right of the kitchen.

427
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,210
Scott: the camera only goes to the people in the kitchen.

428
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:31,138
Scott: It never goes to the area In front of the kitchen.

429
00:29:31,158 --> 00:29:40,284
Scott: or I mean you sort of always feel in the show Like there's not a lot of room there and it goes pretty much to the windows of the facing out or the wall or whatever is over there.

430
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:45,621
Rym: someone found a picture of The wall and what's on the wall that you never got to see.

431
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:54,603
Rym: and then they also put together a series of clips following a Kramer that Actually show literally the full extent of the apartment that you ever see.

432
00:29:54,623 --> 00:29:56,930
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it's just a neat little article.

433
00:29:56,992 --> 00:30:06,779
Rym: It's one of those think about this kind of information that is lost to the ages because there's literally who would think to Like save like what was the full design of the set?

434
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,650
Rym: we live in an era where this sort of thing will stop happening.

435
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:19,390
Rym: Because like I suspect that within 20 or 30 years Every set to every TV show ever that has a set is gonna be 3d scan for posterity and put in a museum, right?

436
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,634
Scott: But it's like we don't know.

437
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:24,385
Scott: say on the set of Ed Sullivan show, right?

438
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,930
Rym: It's like what was behind the desk.

439
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,798
Scott: Is there a spot that we couldn't see?

440
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:29,867
Scott: this is does anyone remember what was there?

441
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:30,610
Scott: Is that right?

442
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,897
Rym: Is there any photo of Dick Van Dyke show?

443
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:36,450
Scott: Does everyone know like everyone who worked on mean the credits?

444
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,595
Scott: It's like what was lost.

445
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:40,110
Scott: I mean a lot of these old things episodes have been lost.

446
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:41,494
Rym: Imagine if like.

447
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:44,949
Rym: imagine if you had a shot from every talking show ever like.

448
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:51,018
Rym: So like every show where a guy sat by a desk and talked at you What it looked like to him like from his perspective.

449
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:55,290
Scott: just like a lot of old live television things are just lost forever, right?

450
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:02,645
Scott: You know, I think the first Super Bowl there's no film or there's only one shit Cameras they use went direct to a broadcast machine.

451
00:31:02,665 --> 00:31:15,757
Scott: They weren't recording they weren't gonna put actual film in there and you know just to record this thing unless it was a major important thing because it cost a lot of money and it was pain in the ass to develop and Recording technology from like digital.

452
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:20,790
Rym: digital like modern cameras came after broadcasting technology, right about that.

453
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:22,235
Scott: I mean a lot.

454
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:27,772
Scott: TV shows just live stand in front of the TV, you know front of the camera do the show and That's it.

455
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:38,740
Rym: And as a bonus, I just noticed at the end Also has an interview with the Seinfeld production designer Specifically on the parking garage episode.

456
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:41,209
Rym: Okay, so there's just a lot of good stuff going on here.

457
00:31:42,437 --> 00:31:48,090
Scott: so One of the bestest game developers out there Zach Tronics.

458
00:31:48,592 --> 00:31:49,837
Scott: He is the maker of many.

459
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:52,709
Scott: well they I guess is more than one person now, but it's mostly Zach.

460
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:55,630
Scott: At least he's the name behind it, right?

461
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:04,767
Scott: it's his deal, you know makers of such games as space cam and infinifactory and You know the programming games.

462
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:06,537
Scott: You got a new game.

463
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:08,025
Scott: It's early access on Steam.

464
00:32:08,045 --> 00:32:08,970
Scott: You can get it right now.

465
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,559
Scott: I'm probably gonna get it when I get home.

466
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,222
Rym: I'm not.

467
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:16,164
Scott: it is Ti s 100 teslaated intelligent system.

468
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:17,630
Scott: What do you do in this game?

469
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:29,070
Scott: you program in assembly language this fictional computer and At the same time that you are learning to program assembly language or using your existing assembly language programming skills.

470
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:37,823
Scott: You are discovering the secrets of this computer much like uplink So sort of like space cam plus uplink plus.

471
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:40,090
Scott: just you're just straight-up programming assembly.

472
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:53,010
Rym: Not like a metaphor for programming like space cam with chemical, you know, right you get the impression There's kind of there's gonna be like a cool Probably sinister plot as you figure out what this computer was doing or what was supposed to be doing.

473
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,716
Scott: I'm sure there is.

474
00:32:53,756 --> 00:32:55,249
Rym: would you even be fixing it?

475
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:05,850
Scott: I haven't programmed assembly things in any assembly language since college and when I did Somehow I got an a even though I didn't consciously fully understand everything.

476
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:11,403
Scott: I Sort of had this natural like inborn talent.

477
00:33:11,443 --> 00:33:18,630
Scott: like there's an evil spirit inside of me That is really good at programming in assembly language, but it is not in my brain.

478
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,737
Scott: It is somewhere else perhaps in my hands.

479
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:27,000
Scott: print and explore like I made a deal with the devil to play banjo Even though I couldn't tell you how to play banjo.

480
00:33:27,362 --> 00:33:29,330
Rym: Ooh, the game comes with a manual.

481
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:31,990
Rym: That's one of those old-style reference manuals to a computer.

482
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:36,645
Scott: You need that for programming any assembly language because it's different from chip to chip.

483
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:40,058
Rym: the first computer I bought my 486 SX - mm-hmm.

484
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:49,406
Rym: It came with like five multi-hundred page books Describing everything down to the voltages on pins and things that came out of the back.

485
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:50,790
Scott: mine had that as well.

486
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:59,324
Scott: I also bought a copy of Borland turbo c++ Something for Windows because it was 90 bucks instead of like.

487
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:00,810
Scott: the full one was hundreds of dollars.

488
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,670
Scott: It came out like 11 floppies that I think I still have and that came with giant books.

489
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,005
Scott: I think I still have them like like a full definition of all the like the.

490
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:11,835
Scott: I don't think it was a C language Definition.

491
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:13,449
Scott: you had to buy the C book for that.

492
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:22,830
Scott: But it had all the like the documentation because it was been a lot of data to download this kind of documentation And you only had so many megabytes in your hard drive and only so many floppy disks, right?

493
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,722
Scott: Yeah, and the internet didn't necessarily exist in those days.

494
00:34:25,742 --> 00:34:27,530
Scott: I don't think there was a network library in there.

495
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:40,489
Scott: All it was mostly documentation on the windows the owl the object windows library Which is how you made windows pop up and control their X buttons and all those sorts of menus and that sort of stuff.

496
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:48,594
Rym: So in the meta moment the next convention we're gonna be at is ConnectiCon we will be doing a bunch of panels edit along With you know running the whole panels department.

497
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:51,725
Rym: as we always say it is a great convention.

498
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:58,550
Rym: if you live within a day's drive Hartford Connecticut, it is well worth your time and money to go to ConnectiCon.

499
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:05,790
Rym: If you have to fly to it, I would not necessarily recommend it unless you have money and time to burn in other news.

500
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:12,650
Scott: Saturday, June 6 of five days from now is the netrunner regional championship in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

501
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,537
Scott: Are you yelling?

502
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:14,323
Scott: I'm going to the beach.

503
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:14,948
Scott: Yeah.

504
00:35:16,591 --> 00:35:32,993
Scott: However, I have obligated somehow to go to the Philadelphia netrunner regionals somehow somehow on the 20th and we're gonna live stream from there and maybe I can convince Rym to come and help me live stream from there 20th.

505
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,350
Scott: that might actually work out cuz I could use some help with the technologies.

506
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:39,450
Rym: Well, then I can bring my camera to still have to super high.

507
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:41,061
Scott: I'm gonna bring the live wedge.

508
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:42,390
Scott: We're gonna put in a whole thing there.

509
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:48,407
Scott: So because this is also the regional championship in Philadelphia where the world champion happens to be from.

510
00:35:48,427 --> 00:35:49,330
Scott: so it's a big deal.

511
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,495
Scott: People are gonna be interested.

512
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,926
Rym: We we could make some magic happen.

513
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:53,247
Rym: Actually.

514
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:53,890
Rym: Yeah together.

515
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:59,087
Rym: Anyway, well the cool things coming in watch our videos on YouTube and share them.

516
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:01,488
Rym: the more they get watched The more likely it is we do shit.

517
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:08,010
Rym: We are seriously considering going to PAX Australia for a third year in a row due to popular and money.

518
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:15,770
Rym: if you want us to go either watch out for an upcoming patreon or Email us and ask us how to send you those money.

519
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:19,344
Scott: Just give me money or ask packs like and you might be like way.

520
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:20,829
Scott: I have a lot less money than you.

521
00:36:21,332 --> 00:36:22,577
Scott: Why would I send you money?

522
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:24,807
Scott: and that is possibly true.

523
00:36:24,827 --> 00:36:27,110
Scott: That is true Especially if you're just like some pump kid.

524
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,790
Scott: You definitely do not have as much money as someone who lives in New York City and has money.

525
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:33,610
Scott: So it might seem like a jerk to ask you for money.

526
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,570
Rym: But if a thousand punk kids give us five bucks we can come to PAX Australia.

527
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,154
Scott: I really have money.

528
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:40,377
Scott: I don't have enough money.

529
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:41,841
Scott: You know, I'm not 1%.

530
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:47,579
Scott: I cannot afford to go to Australia year after year Especially since I've already been there once.

531
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:53,009
Scott: I sort of feel like if I have enough money to go on a vacation I should go somewhere else that I haven't already been.

532
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:58,170
Scott: So if I'm gonna go to Australia again, I will need monies from another source.

533
00:36:58,692 --> 00:37:04,009
Scott: So it's really about you wanting me to go to Australia and not about me wanting to go there.

534
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:11,055
Rym: Yeah me going to Australia the two times that I've gone cost more than a year's rent in places I've lived right.

535
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:17,170
Scott: so don't think of it as I want to go to Australia On a trip and I'm getting you to pay for it because that is not true.

536
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,681
Scott: I don't actually want to go there again that badly.

537
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:21,147
Scott: I mean, I wouldn't mind going.

538
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:27,010
Scott: I'm not gonna lie But it's you want me to go there badly enough that you will pay money for it.

539
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:35,487
Rym: The rewards we're looking at for like the tiers and stuff for like people who actually make this happen are Like one will obviously do meetups like in the places we go in Australia.

540
00:37:35,507 --> 00:37:38,558
Scott: Yeah, I mean Someone else is paying for me to go somewhere.

541
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,010
Scott: I'm gonna be at their whim and not my own whim except fuck you.

542
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,010
Scott: I'm going to the coral reef, but I'll do that on my own dime.

543
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:52,587
Rym: we'll probably do a video interview show where Churba was one of our Favorite and most famous and friendly and just generally debonair listener.

544
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:59,340
Rym: friend fans will interview us and There will be no bounds to what he asks us about.

545
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,384
Rym: so that could be interesting.

546
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:01,710
Rym: great video that in Australia.

547
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:05,121
Rym: Sure, we'll do two panels at that point.

548
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:05,944
Scott: I agree to this.

549
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:07,830
Rym: I'm just saying that could be that would be cool.

550
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:13,290
Scott: Yeah, they told us that if we can get to the packs in Australia that they'll give us two panels.

551
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:16,289
Scott: So we don't have to worry about not being approved or anything, but we need.

552
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,869
Scott: What do you want us to talk about for those panels?

553
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:23,170
Scott: We don't do the same panels you always do over again.

554
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,784
Rym: Well, we're gonna do the same two panels that we submitted to pecs prime.

555
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:27,467
Scott: Are those new?

556
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:32,570
Rym: Yes Oh good, the one about the rules thing and the one about the moving your body thing.

557
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,054
Rym: All right those two those two.

558
00:38:34,214 --> 00:38:35,638
Scott: we'll see if those happen.

559
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:38,667
Rym: yeah, so uh other thing.

560
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:39,890
Rym: one last announcement.

561
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,676
Rym: We are back on iTunes.

562
00:38:42,258 --> 00:38:43,843
Scott: So yeah with shitty album art.

563
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:46,090
Rym: Yeah, I'll say it's better than the old album art.

564
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:51,664
Rym: Sure, if you have an iTunes account Goes even though you don't use iTunes anymore.

565
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:52,610
Rym: cuz iTunes is terrible.

566
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:55,541
Rym: Just go subscribe or at least review us because there are.

567
00:38:56,003 --> 00:39:00,636
Rym: the top reviews are from like 2006 it doesn't matter.

568
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:04,549
Scott: I mean only do it if you want to shamelessly promote us.

569
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:07,538
Scott: But I'm doing it way worse.

570
00:39:07,618 --> 00:39:11,890
Rym: media than us shamelessly self promotes through its fans way more than us.

571
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:16,800
Scott: And it's all because I have Pride, I'm not gonna do low-class shit like that.

572
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:27,931
Scott: But if other people do low-class shit like that on our behalf We don't feel bad, but it's low-class to even ask them to do low-class shit, which is why I'm not asking Rym is asking Class.

573
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:30,234
Rym: there's a nice layer of segregation there.

574
00:39:30,255 --> 00:39:31,376
Rym: No, no, no.

575
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,359
Rym: No, it's uh, it's quite lowbrow.

576
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:43,750
Scott: It is very oh Yeah, and the book club book is Scott's pick Robert Jordan's first book of Wheel of Time.

577
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:47,429
Rym: Listener already messaged us saying please don't make it the book.

578
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:51,270
Scott: But a lot of other people said actually I love these books.

579
00:39:51,531 --> 00:39:58,575
Rym: I have to go see if anyone who said Wheel of Time is good also said ready player one is good Cuz ready player one.

580
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:00,341
Scott: Well, I can tell you our bitch.

581
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:02,087
Scott: I have read in garbage.

582
00:40:02,328 --> 00:40:02,589
Scott: I ever.

583
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:09,975
Scott: I agree I have read a few chapters now of This Wheel of Time and so far it is Fantasy novel.

584
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,809
Rym: but is it on the level of an RA?

585
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,960
Scott: Salvatore or no, it's way better than that.

586
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,628
Rym: It's no prince of nothing now.

587
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,412
Scott: I'm assuming Not yet.

588
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:24,770
Scott: All right, nothing nothing in I mean prince of nothing in the first chapter is already prince of nothing, right?

589
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,040
Scott: The first chapter so far, I'll tell you what.

590
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,190
Scott: so basically it this is sort of a similar typical structure.

591
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,144
Scott: Right first thing in the book maps good sign, right?

592
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:34,425
Scott: Actually.

593
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,450
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of a good site.

594
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:47,102
Scott: Then there's a prologue about like oh the of the great characters right like the great king and the big shield door Right, and then it goes to the village with the normal characters.

595
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:54,864
Scott: and then whoo some powerful characters Superfantasy show up and of course, it's the dark times are coming.

596
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:56,369
Scott: Whoo, and that's so far all I've read.

597
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,276
Scott: So generic fantasy story.

598
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:12,121
Scott: this you know village normal village folk are getting it involved in the big plot Because there's dark times all over the world not just in their village and they've only found out now because only now Have people from the other parts of the world come to visit them.

599
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:13,970
Scott: They thought it was just dark times in their area.

600
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:16,158
Scott: It turns out dark times everywhere.

601
00:41:16,258 --> 00:41:17,643
Scott: evil who got to fight it.

602
00:41:17,904 --> 00:41:27,335
Rym: I guess what worries me is that there are three distinct classes and equal parts of people who have told who have said things about this book after we picked it the first third of People saying I love the book.

603
00:41:27,716 --> 00:41:29,822
Rym: the second third of people saying that book is garbage.

604
00:41:30,223 --> 00:41:42,941
Scott: and the third third are people Putting a lot of effort into defending the book that people put a lot ever to defending anything when we assaulted which we did Without knowing even reading one page.

605
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:55,365
Rym: I mean I randomly I was chat I was like pruning my shit in YouTube and there are some butthurt comments on that really brief video We put up about the Kingkiller Chronicle of people saying guys, it's way better than you're making it out to me.

606
00:41:55,385 --> 00:41:55,786
Scott: No, it's not.

607
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:59,179
Scott: Yeah Sorry, I mean, sorry Rothfuss.

608
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:01,910
Rym: So I guess we should do the actual show, right?

609
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,665
Scott: So it's an issue going down with SourceForge people don't know.

610
00:42:05,846 --> 00:42:09,870
Scott: before there was github There was days of Isildur.

611
00:42:13,112 --> 00:42:14,698
Scott: Well, what was the other site that died?

612
00:42:14,738 --> 00:42:15,802
Scott: and we did a news when it died.

613
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:17,569
Rym: Oh God fresh meat.

614
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:22,270
Rym: yes Wow that I just had a flashback to an earlier era, right?

615
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,775
Scott: Well, and there was download comm in the way olden days I mean, I guess I technically still exist.

616
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:37,286
Rym: download comm exists today in the same way cows two cows in the same way That the that Russia is a successor to the Soviet Union in the successor to the czar.

617
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:42,570
Scott: in the days before steam There were all these gaming file sites to go a game spot.

618
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:46,540
Scott: Anyway, but there's SourceForge and SourceForge is basically.

619
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,786
Scott: I have an open source project.

620
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:53,280
Scott: We are going to use CVS because that was what was there back then.

621
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,885
Rym: we're too old to use github.

622
00:42:55,026 --> 00:43:16,417
Scott: eventually SVN came around but there was CVS and then SVN and I want to work at his open source project with people somewhere else on earth and we need to have a publicly hosted Code repository so that anyone who wants to you can check out the code and submit commits and also so that when we build binaries or zips or Redistributable files for this project.

623
00:43:16,437 --> 00:43:17,982
Scott: They are also hosted and downloadable.

624
00:43:18,704 --> 00:43:22,736
Scott: So there's a site called SourceForge That offered that service.

625
00:43:22,856 --> 00:43:30,060
Scott: It was one of the cores of the like the open source developer can write I mean Linux for hosted their stuff and they still do it.

626
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,046
Scott: kernel that org whatever.

627
00:43:32,127 --> 00:43:35,677
Scott: but you know Slashdot eventually bought the SourceForge company.

628
00:43:35,718 --> 00:43:37,041
Scott: They're part of the same company both owned

629
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:38,867
Rym: by like dice or someone whatever

630
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:49,540
Scott: company it is these days I don't know but it was the place you would go for if there was like an open source project usually found a Windows computer because if you're On Linux computer just apt-get or yum, or whatever it was.

631
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,068
Scott: Yeah, or you know, whatever I don't know.

632
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:52,690
Scott: emerge.

633
00:43:54,392 --> 00:43:55,938
Rym: The gimp is the example using now if you

634
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,464
Scott: had a man on arch, right if

635
00:43:57,504 --> 00:44:00,133
Rym: you needed a program like the gimp Yeah

636
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:08,822
Scott: on Ubuntu you go apt-get install gimp but on Windows you have to download gimp set up that exe and What you would get that from would probably be SourceForge.

637
00:44:09,043 --> 00:44:15,350
Rym: because in the old days if someone asked me like, you know Ten years ago if someone said hey Rym, where do I download name of open source thing?

638
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:19,404
Rym: I'd say just go to SourceForge don't trust it from anywhere else, right?

639
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:19,906
Scott: Because that's like.

640
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:21,170
Scott: that's the source, right?

641
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,559
Scott: That's the.

642
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:26,369
Scott: you know The hosting there is associated with the source code that it was made from.

643
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:30,850
Scott: So, you know, that's a good place to download the file because that's directly from the people who made it.

644
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:39,089
Scott: It's not like some third party took that perhaps Modified it and then delivered it to you on some other shady file website like download.

645
00:44:39,189 --> 00:44:42,709
Scott: calm We're just like oh good download calm search or something you find it.

646
00:44:43,152 --> 00:44:46,410
Scott: Oh, it's not the original program which may have already been able to begin with.

647
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:54,570
Scott: It's a modified setup exe that really just has some evil thing and then unbundles the original setup that exe afterwards.

648
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,894
Scott: Screw that now.

649
00:44:55,975 --> 00:45:11,130
Rym: This was not as big of a problem back then as it is now like There weren't as many just like this is malware exe is masquerading as legit software like it happened But not as often as you would think compared to today, right?

650
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:18,392
Rym: So fast forward to the future and if you go to one of those like C neti download e.com type websites You're already fine.

651
00:45:18,453 --> 00:45:19,938
Rym: It's all just malware and garbage.

652
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:27,950
Rym: Yeah, but most people still think of SourceForge is oh, yeah Go to SourceForge turns out that is not the case and that is the scandal that is coming out.

653
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,770
Scott: Cuz github has destroyed SourceForge.

654
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:36,509
Scott: Basically, the thing is github doesn't do as good a job at offering the be already compiled distributable files, but they sort of do.

655
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:45,650
Scott: But you know in terms of host your source code in a place so that everyone can work on it together GitHub destroys everyone else is blow them out of the water.

656
00:45:46,131 --> 00:45:50,344
Scott: So SourceForge is really seen a lot of people leaving and they're not making money anymore.

657
00:45:50,886 --> 00:45:55,390
Scott: So they've resorted to Evilness to sort of keep their shit going.

658
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,563
Rym: so what they did is they basically took the gimp the windows binary.

659
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:03,809
Rym: windows binary made a mirror and Compromised it with adware bullshit.

660
00:46:04,311 --> 00:46:15,687
Scott: So if you download the windows gimp right from SourceForge the place that it was used to be officially hosted It was sort of you're gonna get a modified setup that has evil malwares on.

661
00:46:15,727 --> 00:46:19,337
Rym: here's their SourceForge is statement on this quote.

662
00:46:19,939 --> 00:46:24,934
Rym: in cases where a project is no longer actively being maintained, but it's being maintained It's the gimp.

663
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:30,962
Rym: SourceForge has in some cases Established a mirror of releases that are hosted elsewhere.

664
00:46:31,243 --> 00:46:34,759
Rym: This was done for gimp win In quote.

665
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,725
Rym: now I point out Yeah, it was a mirror an ad enabled installer.

666
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:40,228
Rym: Mm-hmm.

667
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:46,430
Rym: So don't go to SourceForge anymore and you can read this story to learn about all the details.

668
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:47,735
Rym: Yeah, the gimp team was like.

669
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:48,539
Rym: no that's bullshit.

670
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:49,202
Rym: What the fuck?

671
00:46:49,362 --> 00:46:50,186
Scott: You know, it all sucks.

672
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:55,789
Scott: just yesterday I had to go and get a program that I wanted and SourceForge wasn't just.

673
00:46:56,551 --> 00:47:02,310
Scott: It was the only place to get it and it's a very good program and luckily I checked and that installer was not modified.

674
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:03,236
Scott: Now I have the installer.

675
00:47:03,256 --> 00:47:04,464
Scott: I never need to go to search for it again.

676
00:47:04,484 --> 00:47:09,809
Rym: Yep, so That the problem is the succinct topic for the remainder of this show.

677
00:47:10,838 --> 00:47:16,563
Rym: Now in 2015 How do you determine like where the actual version of software is?

678
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:19,250
Rym: and you'd think oh just go to the maintainers website like the actual?

679
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,595
Rym: Website.

680
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:22,884
Rym: a lot of projects don't have a maintainer's website.

681
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:30,024
Scott: So this is a long time Existing problem that you know, mostly Linux and open source people have had to deal with right.

682
00:47:30,064 --> 00:47:43,390
Scott: because when it comes to something like You know a big company like Adobe or Microsoft or whatever, you know There's like this official place to get the programs from you know, you need to download software install it on your computer.

683
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,053
Scott: How do you know that?

684
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:48,510
Scott: what you think you're downloading is what you're downloading creative cloud exe from?

685
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,838
Rym: Adobe creative cloud TV, right?

686
00:47:51,978 --> 00:47:54,265
Scott: It's like you install steam from valve comm.

687
00:47:54,425 --> 00:47:55,308
Scott: you're gonna be 99% sure.

688
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,736
Scott: That's just steam right.

689
00:47:57,796 --> 00:48:01,970
Scott: and then you inside of steam click say install that game.

690
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:04,239
Scott: You're pretty sure that's totally legit.

691
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,219
Scott: because still on your iPhone you go to the App Store You click install on an app.

692
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:10,170
Scott: It's coming from the official Apple App Store.

693
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,005
Scott: They're sort of taking care of you, right?

694
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:14,035
Scott: you know that it's not the same time.

695
00:48:14,095 --> 00:48:22,925
Rym: that is problematic as we've talked about many times because the App Store model of Controlled vetted walled garden is a controlled vetted walled garden.

696
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,938
Scott: obviously it has problems but it doesn't have.

697
00:48:24,978 --> 00:48:29,348
Scott: the problem of What you think you're downloading is not actually what you're downloading.

698
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:29,570
Rym: now.

699
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:35,768
Rym: This gets extra complicated and the best example of what I'm about to describe you in the world is putty right.

700
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:45,801
Rym: putty is the SSH SCP clients for windows Period if you want to SSH into something putty is it?

701
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:50,660
Scott: I mean there are many forks of putty like kitty and others and there's also similar putty clone.

702
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:57,889
Scott: ish programs like Mobex term is out there, but that cost money sort of and you know.

703
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:03,970
Rym: So if you want to download putty and you go to most places that have the putty exe you're fucked.

704
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:05,254
Rym: That is malware.

705
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:05,635
Rym: Yeah.

706
00:49:05,655 --> 00:49:09,749
Rym: In fact, there's a specific malware that's targeting the financial sector right now putty.

707
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:11,225
Rym: I've been warning people about.

708
00:49:11,245 --> 00:49:24,795
Rym: yeah but the only way to know if you go to the legitimate site the Actual maintainer and creators website and you're not an ultra nerd who just knows you would not trust this site for shit It's just all text.

709
00:49:25,157 --> 00:49:32,346
Rym: the URL to download putty is www.chi arc dot green and are you sure that's right?

710
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,049
Rym: dot UK?

711
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:36,730
Scott: How can that possibly be right tilde SG test?

712
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:41,709
Scott: I thought it was like putty dot org or something that no putty dot org also redirects here as it.

713
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:46,656
Rym: Yes, if you go to putty dot org I'm doing it right now in front of Scott.

714
00:49:47,138 --> 00:49:49,225
Rym: because so download putty.

715
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:52,837
Rym: you can download putty here Chi arc green and dark or okay.

716
00:49:52,917 --> 00:49:56,930
Scott: All right now does this slash tilde username putty download?

717
00:49:57,951 --> 00:49:59,375
Scott: So, how do you know?

718
00:49:59,716 --> 00:49:59,936
Scott: right?

719
00:49:59,976 --> 00:50:07,359
Scott: so maybe someone else bought the domain putty org or bought this domain and pointed it at some Other server and it's serving up shady.

720
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:10,090
Rym: putty dot exe and did some like Google juice to make it show.

721
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:16,370
Scott: Maybe someone hacked into the putty server and changed some of the stuff files around right so that you go download putty exe.

722
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:17,408
Scott: You're getting the wrong one.

723
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,613
Scott: How do you know?

724
00:50:18,673 --> 00:50:25,538
Scott: well first of all SSL is supposed to protect you in some fashion because that way this site is not Ssl-secured.

725
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:26,689
Scott: that's a problem, isn't it?

726
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:38,218
Scott: because you should need the SSL because that way you know that when you look at your location bar and it says putty org and You see the SSL that means aha This actually is putty org.

727
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:40,363
Scott: It didn't get redirected some other computer.

728
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:42,729
Scott: This is the legit putty or not?

729
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:44,598
Rym: T.org?

730
00:50:44,618 --> 00:50:51,099
Scott: you don't need the encryption part of it You need the signing part of it as in you know There was a digital signature.

731
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:56,189
Scott: the person who owns that certificate Which was verified and whatever that human being signed it.

732
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:00,165
Scott: But it is confirmed that this site is the site that you want to go to.

733
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:00,948
Scott: it's their site.

734
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:02,212
Scott: even I'm shady.

735
00:51:02,253 --> 00:51:09,481
Rym: you have to trust the certificate authority and any delegations in the entire chain leading down to that certificate.

736
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:16,928
Rym: and there have been Numerous cases of dodgy Chinese certificates being made with dodgy chains of trust that don't immediately get caught.

737
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:17,510
Scott: that is true.

738
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:23,230
Scott: So, how do you know that when you download putty.exe that that is a legit putty.exe?

739
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,907
Rym: Well, there's a checksum on the website MD5.

740
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:30,750
Rym: So if I download it from this website This website will let me confirm that what I download it is from this website, right?

741
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,558
Scott: So you MD5 some the exe that you downloaded.

742
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:34,702
Scott: any number comes out.

743
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:37,370
Scott: you look at the number on the website and they match.

744
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:39,194
Rym: It's like aha but it's the same.

745
00:51:39,394 --> 00:51:51,850
Scott: that tells you that the person who made the website and wrote that number there is In fact the same person who is Telling you that this exe file is trustworthy.

746
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:56,190
Rym: So here's a signed letter from myself and you can trust the website is legitimate.

747
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:59,321
Scott: Then you can also trust that the file is legitimate.

748
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:01,970
Rym: So we could use the MD 5 in another way.

749
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:05,040
Rym: So say I already have putty running and Scott needs to download it.

750
00:52:05,381 --> 00:52:06,143
Rym: So we download.

751
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,250
Scott: we assume that rims putty is good.

752
00:52:08,454 --> 00:52:09,168
Scott: It's not evil.

753
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:13,530
Scott: You can MD 5 some his putty and I can MD 5 some mine and if we get the same number.

754
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,501
Scott: We know we have identical files and we can.

755
00:52:15,822 --> 00:52:17,210
Scott: if I can trust his I can trust mine.

756
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:22,235
Rym: Yeah, of course if there are new versions the hash changes I've there are different builds.

757
00:52:22,516 --> 00:52:24,865
Rym: the hash changes even different platforms.

758
00:52:24,905 --> 00:52:26,129
Rym: The hash will likely change.

759
00:52:27,332 --> 00:52:45,830
Rym: The other factor is that a lot of these kinds of projects have a series of tools but if you want say the gooey thing or The windows build or install or whatever they link to you to let a third website Mm-hmm with the windows builds of a lot of old open source things are on even dodgier looking websites.

760
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:53,757
Scott: well, the fundamental problem here is that these software packages are being distributed as binaries on Linux machines and other open source platforms.

761
00:52:53,798 --> 00:53:04,659
Scott: you can distribute things as source if you want and if you're distributing programs as source You can trust them because you can read the source code and compile it yourself And then you don't want to do that.

762
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:16,562
Rym: if you have to get install or whatever, you know You're using like RPM yum, whatever pirate then you at least are trusting that the repository Maintainer has gotten legitimate bill, right?

763
00:53:16,622 --> 00:53:18,290
Scott: So, you know, for example, you have Ubuntu.

764
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,539
Scott: You're using Ubuntu so you have to get install something.

765
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,465
Scott: what actually happens there, right?

766
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:25,689
Scott: This is what actually happens.

767
00:53:26,613 --> 00:53:40,708
Scott: by default in the apt configuration file are URLs of Repositories that you are trusting and by default the only ones in there are the official ones Run by canonical the Ubuntu company and you have secure SSL certificates.

768
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:54,540
Scott: Right so that when you are connecting to those machines to get your package list and your package updates and your software You're verifying Cryptographically that that computer is the computer that you trusted before.

769
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:56,465
Scott: it hasn't changed as it moved.

770
00:53:56,766 --> 00:54:00,770
Scott: It's not some other masquerade It's legit the same original.

771
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:05,850
Scott: The only the people who are modifying what's on that computer are the people you trusted in the first place.

772
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,083
Rym: Yep, so the moral you got to trust someone.

773
00:54:08,104 --> 00:54:11,336
Scott: Yep, and You can if you want to.

774
00:54:11,417 --> 00:54:17,830
Scott: you can do add apt repository add right to add More repositories to get software from somewhere else.

775
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:22,085
Scott: But you're manually saying add this certificate as a trusted certificate.

776
00:54:22,165 --> 00:54:41,290
Scott: any software that they provide I will trust and then it will do the same verification and in addition to that it gets the MD 5 sums from Those trusted places and even after it downloads files from the trusted places It compares those checksums to the files to make sure that those are the ones that have been trusted.

777
00:54:41,734 --> 00:54:45,239
Rym: So here's a. here's a deeper problem From first principles.

778
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,589
Rym: How do you decide who to trust first?

779
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:51,844
Scott: So I guess if you're trusting someone with the OS, right?

780
00:54:52,466 --> 00:54:53,089
Scott: It's like well, alright.

781
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:54,175
Rym: So which Linux?

782
00:54:54,235 --> 00:54:56,670
Rym: who maintains that particular flavor of Linux, right?

783
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,150
Rym: You got to trust Linus and you got to trust the people who make that Linux or you can read the source code.

784
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:02,494
Rym: Are you gonna do that?

785
00:55:02,514 --> 00:55:07,130
Rym: No, I mean, I guess first principles wise the only the only by a car.

786
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,437
Scott: How do you trust that that cars is not gonna explode?

787
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:09,919
Scott: but there

788
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:22,030
Rym: is not a modern history of people selling malware cars Here in town selling a whole bunch of fake cars like Donald Duck that suddenly collapse on

789
00:55:22,991 --> 00:55:24,510
Scott: Exploding cars though, you know

790
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:31,550
Rym: Actually, I read interestingly that the car you're thinking of was no more likely to explode in that kind of accident or kill its occupants.

791
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:33,197
Rym: Then other similar cars.

792
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:36,330
Scott: I was thinking about when the Mafia rigs your car to explode on purpose.

793
00:55:36,551 --> 00:55:37,456
Rym: That's a separate thing.

794
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:38,601
Rym: That didn't happen as office.

795
00:55:38,963 --> 00:55:57,890
Rym: Yeah, but I think the real answer right now because we can come up with some clever idea of like a hat like a repository of Hashes with its own SSL people just that people to agree to trust like techies all know That is like if you want to check if your build is legit, they maintain an archive of legit.

796
00:55:58,091 --> 00:56:04,135
Scott: I mean, it's like, you know, you can go and get your OS X DVD or USB stick from the Apple store Which you can trust.

797
00:56:04,376 --> 00:56:07,530
Scott: yeah, then put it in and only install things from the App Store.

798
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:11,503
Scott: Right, and then you have this chain of trust like why trusted the Apple Store?

799
00:56:11,543 --> 00:56:12,084
Scott: physically?

800
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:13,368
Scott: they gave me this stick.

801
00:56:13,429 --> 00:56:18,064
Scott: physically I trust that and I only get apps through the Apple App Store.

802
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:18,646
Scott: That's official.

803
00:56:18,686 --> 00:56:21,014
Scott: I can trust that - yep Stay in a walled garden.

804
00:56:21,095 --> 00:56:24,890
Scott: You won't accidentally install some app from some website.

805
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:25,595
Scott: That was my.

806
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:26,742
Scott: that isn't what you think it is.

807
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:27,689
Scott: Oh, I'm installing VLC.

808
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:34,468
Scott: ha ha no evil person who modified VLC and tricked you into downloading my modified VLC with evil spyware in it.

809
00:56:34,589 --> 00:56:38,590
Rym: now bear in Mind we're not talking about downloading apps that are bad on purpose.

810
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,170
Rym: We're talking about apps that you think are one app but are actually another app, right?

811
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:54,090
Scott: And usually this only happens if you go to places that are obviously not official download.com CNET You go to like Pirate Bay because you don't want to pay for Photoshop.

812
00:56:54,552 --> 00:56:56,680
Scott: Yeah, you're pretty much gave you do that kind of shit.

813
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,266
Scott: You're almost guaranteed to get hosed.

814
00:56:58,406 --> 00:57:00,294
Rym: almost in the modern era You are guaranteed.

815
00:57:00,496 --> 00:57:00,998
Rym: years ago.

816
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,505
Rym: I think as an experiment.

817
00:57:02,546 --> 00:57:03,410
Rym: I set up a Windows VM.

818
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:17,207
Rym: I went and download a bunch of Adobe software and one by one I tried installing them and then I watched and catalogued the Ridiculous amount of data that started flying out of my computer to IP addresses all over the world.

819
00:57:17,227 --> 00:57:18,510
Rym: It was amazing.

820
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:30,129
Scott: Yep, so it's like technically speaking on a pure mathematical cryptographic trust basis You can't even really trust putty.org to be it's legit for it's not.

821
00:57:30,209 --> 00:57:31,815
Rym: nor Can you trust reading the source code.

822
00:57:31,835 --> 00:57:36,170
Rym: remember that story we did years ago about people who showed that you could compromise?

823
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:43,476
Rym: compilers to then compromise software compilation Mm-hmm.

824
00:57:43,496 --> 00:57:45,201
Rym: So you also have to know the compiler.

825
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:47,990
Rym: and so basically here's the real answer.

826
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,355
Rym: I came up with it during the show.

827
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:50,118
Rym: be realistic.

828
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:55,963
Scott: Just make sure you're at the official websites of things Downloading the most official versions of things.

829
00:57:56,405 --> 00:57:57,430
Scott: don't install shit.

830
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:05,116
Scott: You don't need only install and it you know, it's not just you know, make sure you get your programs You know from the right place.

831
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:06,721
Scott: It's don't use shitty program.

832
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:09,570
Scott: Yeah, I like VLC is a pretty trustworthy video player.

833
00:58:10,013 --> 00:58:14,945
Scott: Don't go and get like X Something something player that no one ever fucking heard of that.

834
00:58:15,247 --> 00:58:15,910
Scott: shady as hell.

835
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,458
Rym: That's why your laptop crashes at your panels, right?

836
00:58:18,819 --> 00:58:20,604
Scott: You know use something that's popular.

837
00:58:20,624 --> 00:58:23,695
Scott: It's like yeah, you can use Chrome You can use Firefox.

838
00:58:23,755 --> 00:58:26,527
Scott: don't go using like, you know chameleon?

839
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:27,754
Scott: weirdo, bro I don't know.

840
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:32,642
Scott: I think chameleon is a browser just like Weirdo browser made by someone else.

841
00:58:32,904 --> 00:58:33,447
Scott: That's no name.

842
00:58:34,352 --> 00:58:41,088
Rym: Also in terms of like Windows builds of open software I think I can list every piece of software you should ever bought.

843
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:44,622
Rym: download Unless you have a clean really the only things you need most.

844
00:58:44,662 --> 00:58:45,365
Rym: what like gimp?

845
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:48,960
Rym: if you're doing photos You can you putty paint.net if you want.

846
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:52,688
Rym: instead putty win SCP brow like a browser.

847
00:58:53,511 --> 00:58:53,637
Rym: OBS.

848
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:59,230
Rym: Already, I can't take VLC a bit torrent client, but even then most of those are bullshit.

849
00:58:59,531 --> 00:59:04,470
Rym: Yeah, don't sound look do not download the actual bit torrent client and also do not download micro torrent.

850
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,215
Rym: They're both bad now steam.

851
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:07,839
Scott: Yep, Spotify.

852
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,441
Rym: It's not open.

853
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:09,364
Rym: It's just binary.

854
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:16,030
Scott: a fish, you know Adobe apps But those are paid right anyway, you don't need on a modern computer.

855
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,401
Scott: There's so few things you actually need to install.

856
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:20,410
Scott: 99% of everything you do is in your web browser.

857
00:59:20,572 --> 00:59:26,547
Scott: Anyway, and then you know you just need to go by SSL for trustworthiness there from a first principles standpoint.

858
00:59:26,748 --> 00:59:29,421
Rym: if you Can't figure out if it's legit or not.

859
00:59:29,662 --> 00:59:38,080
Rym: There's only one way to know Ask someone like us like really ask someone who's an actual tech person who is old enough to know.

860
00:59:38,932 --> 00:59:42,889
Rym: The people who are a lot younger tend to be over trusting and people are a lot older.

861
00:59:44,171 --> 00:59:47,825
Rym: They're running Cygwin on their windows desktop for day-to-day operations.

862
00:59:48,467 --> 01:00:03,310
Rym: So Virtual box you can install find someone between the ages of like 19 and 40 ish and ask them Where to get the name of the software because they'll either tell you she arc dot green and dot org dot UK.

863
01:00:04,551 --> 01:00:06,277
Scott: Don't use that software at all.

864
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:10,230
Rym: use this other software and you're gonna get a chromogeny tirade like you just got.

865
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:14,310
Rym: Yeah, if you're downloading something dumb, but you won't download malware.

866
01:00:20,523 --> 01:00:23,060
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

867
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,859
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

868
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:30,128
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

869
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:33,180
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

870
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:40,859
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

871
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,396
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

872
01:00:45,641 --> 01:00:48,751
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

873
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:50,416
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

874
01:00:50,536 --> 01:00:51,820
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
