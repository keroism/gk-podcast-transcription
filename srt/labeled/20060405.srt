1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,740
Scott: It's Wednesday, April 5th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:18,430
Scott: Tonight we talk about one of our favorite anime series Lupin de Sun.

3
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,346
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:29,170
Rym: So yesterday my thing of the day for all of you who listen to all nights of GeekNights Was about World of Warcraft and that funeral.

5
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:37,630
Rym: Well that stupid thing for whatever reason made it all over the internet and made it on to the actual real national news.

6
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:38,915
Scott: I can't believe that.

7
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:43,432
Rym: I know it did so because my co-workers discovered it and They always.

8
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:48,089
Rym: they know me as that guy who knows all that stuff that we don't know.

9
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:56,350
Rym: So whenever they encounter something strange They bring it to me like it's this golden thing and they want me to enlighten them as to what it is and why it matters.

10
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:59,722
Rym: Now none of them had ever heard of World of Warcraft.

11
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:01,470
Rym: In fact, they'd never heard of an MMO.

12
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:03,317
Rym: They don't even know what one is.

13
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,510
Rym: when I tried to explain what one is they didn't understand.

14
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:12,545
Scott: That's sort of like when I try to tell my grandma like close the window She doesn't know how to close and she doesn't know what a window is.

15
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:18,230
Rym: Yeah I mean I was like, it's a persistent world and they're like, what do you mean persistent?

16
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,416
Rym: and I try to explain.

17
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:30,016
Rym: it doesn't go away and people are in it and they have fake characters that they move around and fight with each other and They're like and this is fun.

18
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,501
Rym: And I said no, it's stupid.

19
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:33,509
Rym: I hate it and I hate everyone who plays.

20
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:45,549
Rym: But anyway, then they showed me the video that they'd found which was actually my thing of the day from yesterday and the screen shows a guy running and they turn to me and they ask so what's this guy doing?

21
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:58,711
Rym: and I looked at the screen and I looked at them and I said he's running and Then it got to the point where they're killing everyone at the funeral and they say what's going on now and I said They're fighting.

22
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,624
Rym: I tried to explain how MMOs work or just the basic concept like five times It's lost on them.

23
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:08,515
Rym: They still can't imagine that people would pay money to do something like this.

24
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:09,440
Scott: I can't either.

25
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:12,188
Scott: One thing we have in common.

26
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:12,950
Rym: I did though.

27
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:15,760
Rym: I played the realm for three and a half years.

28
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:22,646
Scott: I played muds when they were free and then I realized oh typing in kill rat a thousand times to make a number bigger It's stupid.

29
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:28,600
Rym: Yeah, well, I'll say that when I played the realm I did it mostly to hang out in the village square in Leenster and talk to all my idiot friends.

30
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,540
Scott: Yeah, I played games and I hung out with all kinds of people but you know what I said.

31
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:34,368
Scott: Oh, this is just a chat room.

32
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,900
Scott: and then I went to chat rooms and then chat rooms are boring.

33
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:38,371
Scott: So I stopped doing that - you know what?

34
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:39,439
Rym: It was just a chat room.

35
00:02:39,862 --> 00:02:42,535
Rym: The thing was I had the same kind of deal you had with puzzle pirates.

36
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:48,629
Rym: I was a beta tester So I really didn't pay much And the enjoyment I got all told was probably well worth it.

37
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,456
Rym: But yeah, anyway, that's my saga.

38
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:51,660
Scott: Let's see puzzle pirates.

39
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:55,490
Scott: Yeah, sure There was a little chat room and stuff But if that was all that was there wouldn't have been good enough.

40
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,299
Scott: the fact that it had fun puzzle games.

41
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,209
Scott: That was where.

42
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,240
Scott: that's what helped it out.

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,552
Rym: I was like a freshman in high school and MMOs didn't exist yet.

44
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:04,640
Rym: This is the first one and it was frickin awesome.

45
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:06,112
Scott: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

46
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:11,946
Rym: Yeah So Singapore is a country.

47
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,211
Scott: It is a country.

48
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:15,218
Scott: It's not a very good country.

49
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,031
Scott: Oh No, it's a rather unpleasant.

50
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:19,500
Scott: Remember that guy who got like cane?

51
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,081
Rym: You know what?

52
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:25,699
Rym: I remember that very clearly and I submit to this day that that guy deserved it.

53
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:27,353
Scott: He did deserve it he wasn't.

54
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,100
Scott: he was an asshole.

55
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:36,400
Rym: He goes to someone else's country where he fully understands the laws of this country Breaks the laws and then is mad when the US government doesn't save him from the consequences.

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,163
Scott: That's not the point.

57
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:40,655
Scott: The point is is that Singapore for all intents and purposes is like 1984 city.

58
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:45,816
Scott: Oh, yeah, like they've got video cameras everywhere and crazy laws and everything.

59
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:49,551
Scott: So like London It's a little weird a little bit.

60
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:50,819
Scott: It's twice as bad.

61
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,949
Rym: So anyway, why is Singapore in the news?

62
00:03:53,210 --> 00:04:00,995
Scott: Singapore has some elections coming up soon And they've passed a new law or edict or whatever during those elections.

63
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:09,170
Scott: and that let me read it to you As a measure against the use of new internet technologies during hustings in Singapore, I guess hustings is elections or election time.

64
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:16,440
Scott: Channel news Asia reported from a parliamentary hearing on Monday that podcasting is not allowed during elections.

65
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,144
Rym: Really?

66
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:18,814
Scott: Here's a five-point breakdown.

67
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:19,699
Scott: and what this means.

68
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:27,289
Scott: Who podcasts political content in Singapore on The bandwagon websites blogs and podcasts.

69
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,677
Scott: how far did this content regulations go?

70
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:30,680
Scott: blah blah blah blah blah.

71
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:44,620
Scott: Basically, no one's going to be allowed to do any sort of political podcasting or blogging or anything During the Singapore elections in Singapore, and I think you're gonna need like a license from the government to do certain sorts of press.

72
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:52,267
Rym: so I Think we have a very valid and typical Possibly expected response to this.

73
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:53,210
Scott: Yes.

74
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,684
Scott: My response is I don't know much about Singaporean politics.

75
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,692
Scott: Singaporean what else is the word?

76
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:02,838
Rym: I don't know but Singaporean sounds funny.

77
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:03,620
Rym: It's like a little fusion.

78
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:03,724
Rym: Yeah.

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:13,997
Scott: Anyway, so I went to Wikipedia to be politics of Singapore webpage and seeing as I don't live in Singapore They can't really persecute me for talking about Singaporean politics.

80
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:14,358
Scott: Wait a minute.

81
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:14,700
Rym: Wait a minute.

82
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,800
Rym: You realize if we go any further we're gonna be in violation of Singapore law.

83
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:20,630
Rym: Yes, if we ever go there, they might cane us.

84
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,440
Scott: I did find out one interesting thing about Singaporean politics.

85
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,063
Scott: Oh, really?

86
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,610
Scott: They have a parliamentary government.

87
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:27,780
Scott: They have quite a few political parties.

88
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:32,700
Scott: Okay, the People's Action Party, which has this cool little lightning bolt for a symbol.

89
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,114
Rym: Lightning bolt is not always the best symbol for a political party.

90
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:42,619
Scott: No, but anyway They have 82 of the 84 seats in In.

91
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:46,863
Scott: They have pretty much They control the government.

92
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:50,269
Scott: Yeah, and they have controlled the government since.

93
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,080
Scott: Oh forever.

94
00:05:53,442 --> 00:06:00,459
Scott: So to anyone who can vote in the Singaporean elections I tell you vote for anyone except the political action party.

95
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,024
Scott: Anyone else at all.

96
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:02,626
Scott: vote for them.

97
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:05,173
Scott: do not vote for the people who have been running Singapore forever.

98
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:05,916
Scott: They're evil.

99
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,277
Scott: 1984. fuck tards.

100
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,126
Scott: Fuck them fuck them fuck them fuck them.

101
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:11,996
Scott: If I lived in Singapore, I would get guns and people and kill them.

102
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:15,658
Scott: god damn evil dictatorship Parliament fuckers.

103
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:19,980
Rym: Yeah, so we can't ever go to Singapore now, that's fine.

104
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,740
Scott: Yeah, we don't want to unless of course they kill all these political action party fuckers and then up then we can go there.

105
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,763
Rym: Yeah, we could.

106
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:28,889
Rym: maybe someone will go all V for Vendetta over there.

107
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:29,752
Scott: Awesome.

108
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:33,823
Scott: Yeah start doing some pirate radio Podcasting.

109
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:36,090
Rym: you can vote for schkneidel if you want.

110
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:37,294
Rym: there should be a recession.

111
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:38,940
Scott: you had to throw that joke in there somewhere.

112
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:39,845
Rym: I was waiting for it.

113
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:41,756
Scott: Couldn't you save it till Election Day?

114
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:45,231
Rym: No, no I'm gonna say that every time it's relevant for the rest of GeekNights.

115
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:50,160
Scott: Well the next time that'll be November When you'll be able to vote for schkneidel.

116
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:54,820
Rym: Alright, so there was a second news that we're not really gonna talk about.

117
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,724
Rym: I just want to mention it.

118
00:06:56,145 --> 00:07:02,730
Rym: a lot of people have said they know how much the PlayStation 3 is going to cost and I'm sure we're gonna get yelled at if we don't talk about it.

119
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,636
Rym: And you know what screw you all.

120
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:08,709
Rym: it's not verified yet And even if it is it doesn't matter.

121
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:12,944
Rym: It's whatever number they say is too expensive unless it's less than 300 Which it won't be.

122
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:15,880
Scott: yeah, the PlayStation 3 cause doesn't mean anything.

123
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,560
Scott: I mean, all right, if it's $400 then it's comparable to the Xbox 360 $500.

124
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,211
Rym: I'm just gonna start laughing hysterically for the rest of this month.

125
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:27,280
Scott: Yeah, the PlayStation 3 is going to be too expensive.

126
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:28,886
Scott: It's not going to be worth the money.

127
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:38,936
Scott: only the RPG playing nuts and the people who are just Blindly and stupidly loyal to the PlayStation name because they're not actual gamers will buy it.

128
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,600
Scott: who who cares go home.

129
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:42,031
Rym: Yeah, so we're really.

130
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:48,260
Rym: we're gonna talk about this But we're gonna wait until the actual price is official and I see it from a legitimate news source.

131
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:50,638
Scott: Oh, there is one the sentence I can add to that.

132
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,152
Scott: The next Grand Theft Auto has been announced.

133
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:59,211
Scott: It's Grand Theft Auto Chicago First Grand Theft Auto that's named after a real city and it's going to.

134
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:07,980
Scott: it's probably gonna be all gangland, which is cool by me Whatever, but it's gonna be a PlayStation 3 exclusive sometime in 2000.

135
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:15,850
Rym: I think it's like July 2007 or something like that now exclusive as in Exclusive or exclusive as in it'll be on the Xbox two months later.

136
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,040
Scott: It'll probably be on the Xbox a few months later.

137
00:08:19,462 --> 00:08:20,387
Rym: I'd buy an Xbox.

138
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,493
Scott: Yeah, me too.

139
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,479
Rym: I like boxes All right.

140
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:33,240
Rym: Anyway, so we can't really avoid talking about the third news because it's been everywhere And in fact, I did not hear about it as early as I could have.

141
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:39,059
Rym: I was sitting in my office and as all of you who listen often know my office mate is Korean and awesome.

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,638
Scott: Oh, it was an April Fool's prank and they didn't say.

143
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:52,679
Scott: I Just went to the GTA Chicago website and apparently it was an April Fool's prank that fooled Real news gaming news sites and they didn't take the joke down.

144
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,665
Rym: And apparently it fooled you too.

145
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:59,920
Scott: No because see the thing is is that I didn't see the joke on the website.

146
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:04,980
Scott: I heard it from a reliable other source and they weren't saying it as if it was April Fool's.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,069
Scott: So they got fooled then.

148
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:11,192
Rym: as a result, I was fooled All right, so I'm not gonna go back and undo what we just put on the air.

149
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:13,380
Rym: That's on to everyone out there listening.

150
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,106
Rym: Hahaha, it's Scott.

151
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:19,783
Scott: There's no such thing as GTA Chicago, but Word to Rockstar.

152
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:20,786
Scott: that's not a bad idea.

153
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:29,404
Rym: Oh, no, I said, oh think of this one the Mafia to the crazy controversy and thus publicity Mm-hmm.

154
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:29,969
Rym: Yeah.

155
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:45,500
Scott: Yeah, it says come Their website is pretty good because actually that's how they found out about previous GTA games that Rockstar would always reserve the domain and stuff and We should reserve a domain Yeah and cause some trouble.

156
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:56,090
Rym: But anyway, so the Korean guy I shared office with is awesome And he's probably the only person in the place I work and all of IBM really that I really like.

157
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,173
Rym: we both play games.

158
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:59,199
Rym: We know about gaming and he's cool.

159
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:06,451
Rym: and He turns to me this morning and says boot camp is out and I look at him and I say what.

160
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:14,746
Rym: and then he says You usually look on the internet and I look and sure enough boot camp is out And boot camp is awesome.

161
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,660
Scott: I don't know about you, but I like to stay away from boot camp.

162
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,200
Scott: I mean heard they make you do a lot of painful exercises and such.

163
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:29,090
Rym: This is probably the least painful boot camp that has ever existed unless there is possibly a pornography That happens to have boot camp involved in it.

164
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:29,492
Rym: Somehow.

165
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:30,778
Scott: I'm sure there is.

166
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:37,440
Rym: I'm actually I'm a hundred percent sure there is yes In fact the first person to post a link to one in our forums will win nothing.

167
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:41,620
Scott: Please don't link to pornography in our forums.

168
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:47,576
Rym: I thought we had a policy of letting people link to whatever they wanted and say whatever they wanted no matter how illegal it may Be because we have no editorial law.

169
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:50,907
Scott: Yeah, we do but at the same time.

170
00:10:50,988 --> 00:10:53,357
Scott: I don't want a bunch of porn spam.

171
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:58,600
Rym: Oh Well, I think we'll talk about the forums later because the forums have been rocking though.

172
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,298
Rym: Scott is starting new somewhat draconian initiative that I'm sure you're sure you've all discovered.

173
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:10,609
Rym: awesome Yeah, but anyway boot camp is actually Apple's official sanctioned legal awesome.

174
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,200
Rym: Well done way to boot Windows XP on a new Mac.

175
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:15,602
Scott: Awesome.

176
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:16,143
Rym: It's.

177
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:31,280
Rym: I mean I've not much is known about it yet because people who haven't been using it enough to write things in their blogs about it, but basically It burns you a little CD full of drivers the drivers that Windows needs to use the crazy Mac hardware.

178
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:36,556
Rym: Okay, then it has a whole bunch of little utilities that let you do everything easily.

179
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:39,329
Rym: you put in the windows CD And you can you know install windows.

180
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:41,180
Rym: it'll let you repartition your drives.

181
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,772
Rym: However, you want does give space to windows and give space to the max.

182
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:54,540
Rym: still it'll let you set up the bootloader So you can pick which one to boot into It'll basically do everything you need to make Windows XP service pack to run perfectly on the new max.

183
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,113
Scott: And as anyone how fast does it go?

184
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:57,173
Scott: um?

185
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:08,336
Rym: I haven't seen any numbers, but the few people who have talked about it online said that these machines are fast now How does it go with like the wind different keyboards?

186
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:08,739
Scott: and said uh?

187
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,586
Rym: Actually, no one said anything about that.

188
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:13,433
Scott: Oh cuz II that's kind of important.

189
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:13,915
Rym: Yeah, well.

190
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:15,140
Rym: I mean this was announced today.

191
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:19,958
Rym: I'm pretty sure that the the whatever meta key will just work as a Windows key.

192
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:23,669
Rym: I mean I Guess yeah, there's not too much of a difference.

193
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,100
Rym: I mean the keyboard will probably map in some way.

194
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:29,980
Scott: Yeah, I guess it's just I don't like the Apple keyboards.

195
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:37,428
Rym: Yeah there's not much out on exactly how well this works yet other than the fact that it works and That Apple is actually supporting this.

196
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,815
Rym: and it's a beta test.

197
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:44,400
Rym: now you have to sign up And then they'll send you the stuff, but yeah, I don't know if they're actually supporting windows, but they're supporting boot camp.

198
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:48,793
Rym: Yeah, so they're supporting you being able to run windows.

199
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:50,438
Rym: They're not supporting windows itself.

200
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,080
Scott: now Wait here's the is the real question can you boot camp Linux or something?

201
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:56,244
Rym: I don't know.

202
00:12:56,264 --> 00:13:06,019
Rym: they were oddly specific in that you can only run Windows XP Service pack 2 if you have an original non upgrade non media center install CD.

203
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:10,292
Rym: You cannot run windows 2000 or 2003 server and his boot camp.

204
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,820
Scott: only work on the power books is work on any Intel Mac.

205
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:15,489
Rym: It appears to work on any Intel Mac even the Mac mini one.

206
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,997
Rym: I believe so, but don't quote me on that.

207
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,409
Scott: uh-huh How do I be out of Mac mini?

208
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,240
Scott: I don't know why you run around windows on that one though.

209
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:34,500
Rym: Yeah, I mean the only real purpose for this I'd see is one if you're a graphic designer or something and you have an awesome awesome MacBook and you would occasionally have to run some windows thing for your publishing company or something like that you need windows for work.

210
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:42,280
Scott: Man, I remember back in the day like the old power PC max You'd be able to push open Apple enter and it would reboot like you wouldn't even reboot.

211
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,760
Scott: It would just kind of switch to DOS slash windows.

212
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,733
Rym: Well Apple still been saying that there's gonna possibly be that compatibility layer.

213
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:51,680
Rym: That'll basically emulate windows.

214
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:54,549
Scott: Yeah, they had perfect wine on a Mac.

215
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:55,994
Scott: I might buy a Mac.

216
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:59,267
Scott: Yeah, like perfect wine I just like good fun.

217
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:01,599
Rym: No, I got to say even dual boot is good enough for me.

218
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,320
Rym: Yeah You know the only thing preventing me from already having a MacBook is that it costs a lot of money.

219
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:11,773
Scott: The only thing preventing me from not having windows is is steam.

220
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,900
Scott: I have to have windows as long as steam exists.

221
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:15,940
Scott: Yeah, I don't even play the stupid steam.

222
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,845
Rym: I just have it Because you don't want to.

223
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:23,168
Rym: you don't want to wake up one day and realize that you currently could not if you wanted to Play natural selection exactly.

224
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:27,568
Rym: That would be a painful morning, and I don't think I get out of bed But I haven't played it in a year.

225
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,154
Rym: Yeah, but all the memories.

226
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:29,796
Scott: Yeah, indeed.

227
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:30,600
Scott: All right.

228
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:37,894
Rym: so anyway, it was news, but we don't really know a lot about it yet and Really only time will tell I expect.

229
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:45,327
Rym: in the next few weeks a lot of people are gonna be posting a lot of information about what works and what doesn't and Tricks and hacks and I'll bet someone's get Linux to work.

230
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:46,511
Rym: Someone will get DOS to work.

231
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:47,474
Rym: Someone will get OS 9.

232
00:14:47,474 --> 00:14:49,848
Scott: Oh It's not.

233
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:50,517
Scott: that'll be awesome.

234
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,640
Scott: I don't know why you'd want to do that because it already runs OS 9 apps like perfectly.

235
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,795
Rym: Yeah, some freakin nerd hacker will do it because he can.

236
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:58,479
Scott: All right, cool.

237
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:11,440
Scott: So apparently Rym tells me that there was a movie called American pimp, which is a documentary on real pimps.

238
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,311
Rym: It's fairly disturbing.

239
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:14,580
Scott: Yeah, that's what he said.

240
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,260
Scott: But anyway, so once I knew that I got this thing of the day became a lot more interesting.

241
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:23,490
Scott: What it is is it's a parody of American pimp.

242
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:29,323
Scott: only instead of the guys pimping hose They're pimping Pokemon.

243
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:33,017
Scott: omg, lol the poke a pimp hilarious.

244
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:33,760
Rym: Oh my god.

245
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:35,695
Scott: So this is a video parodying.

246
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,098
Scott: a movie parodying Pokemon.

247
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:45,809
Scott: Pokey pimps reminds me of that guy who was the pokey pimp at one of those cons that you went to Yeah, and he had all the Pika girls around him.

248
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:52,060
Rym: Yeah, that guy was awesome cos I gotta say there's almost no finer sight in the world than a posse of poke pimps.

249
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:55,620
Scott: poke pimps with Pika girls.

250
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:58,339
Rym: Too many peas Pika hose.

251
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:05,642
Rym: Actually, there was a girl at anime central who followed along with all them, but she was dressed up as a jigglypuff Uh-huh.

252
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:11,179
Rym: Yeah only of course her idea of jigglypuff was basically she was wearing pink fur and little else.

253
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:14,873
Scott: Hey, you see jigglypuff like when you pull up the jigglypuff.

254
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:19,677
Scott: It's like a list of powers like sing attack turn a trick.

255
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,202
Rym: But Really?

256
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:25,039
Rym: This is like this is well done and funny.

257
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:36,125
Scott: Yeah, so if you know anything about Pokemon and you know anything about American pimp or pimps and pimpin pimp hats watch this All right.

258
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:39,340
Rym: So my thing of the day I tend to do things like this now.

259
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:47,900
Rym: It usually means you there's something so awesome that I can't pass it up or it's about Egypt Which means that I can't pass it up or I couldn't find anything better.

260
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:49,804
Rym: Today it's the third one.

261
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:52,433
Rym: But actually this is kind of cool in Mexico.

262
00:16:52,954 --> 00:17:00,755
Rym: They discovered another Giant buried pyramid from back when there were non-hispanics in that area.

263
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:02,340
Scott: You mean like Aztec pyramid?

264
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:03,183
Rym: Yeah, like.

265
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:06,454
Rym: it's apparently the same size as the famous Pyramid of the Moon.

266
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:07,819
Scott: That's a big pyramid.

267
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:25,159
Rym: Now the reason they just found it The reason they didn't find it for so long is that there's this big hill and this hill is where every year Lots of Christians get together and they reenact in a very gory fashion the crucifixion of Christ and This archaeologist named Jesus Sanchez.

268
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:32,520
Rym: Haha, Jesus was talking about how they discovered this giant pyramid two feet beneath the dirt that made up this mound.

269
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:39,020
Rym: Apparently the pyramid was buried under dirt for whatever reason around 500 AD and we just found it again.

270
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:44,863
Scott: So, let me get this straight Jesus Sanchez who was a Archaeologist.

271
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,127
Rym: Yep.

272
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:54,798
Scott: He so Jesus bended off the Christians who were trying to crucify him So that he could dig up the pyramid of ancient times of awesome.

273
00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:05,077
Rym: now Apparently half of the pyramid has been destroyed because of the Christians who dig into this tent this mound constantly to Recrucify Jesus over and over again.

274
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:07,720
Rym: So they've damaged it significantly.

275
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:16,568
Rym: Now I don't know how much many of you know about the pre-christian history of Mexico and South America and Central America As Tex Mayas and Incas.

276
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,460
Rym: Yeah, but basically there are also other tribes.

277
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:28,071
Rym: but the main thing here is that and it's the relevant part at least is that there were all these pyramids and Temples and various things because they were all various pagan religions.

278
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:29,155
Rym: They worship various gods.

279
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:32,463
Rym: My favorite being Quetzalcoatl Quetzalcoatl.

280
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:34,913
Rym: Yes, who supposedly will come back in 2012 and do something?

281
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:40,890
Scott: Dude if he comes back, I'm totally converting to as Techism.

282
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,965
Scott: Oh, yeah That's a religion.

283
00:18:43,185 --> 00:18:45,193
Rym: lest this become the order of Quetzalcoatl.

284
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:47,998
Scott: I mean if someone comes out to me and says they're a Christian I'm just like whatever.

285
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:50,748
Scott: And someone comes up to me says they're as techism.

286
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:51,851
Scott: I'm like, that's fine.

287
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:58,205
Rym: You know, there are people who actually are pantheistic Greek Like even Zeus.

288
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:02,295
Scott: Yes, like they think there's a real Zeus that they climbed Mount Olympus lately.

289
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,040
Rym: They're a fairly significant.

290
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:07,874
Rym: They're not huge and I don't know how devout they are but they exist.

291
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:09,680
Scott: have they seen a Medusa lately?

292
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:11,267
Scott: How about any siren?

293
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:12,654
Rym: No one's ever seen a Medusa.

294
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:15,436
Rym: and if they did well That's my point.

295
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,760
Scott: Yes, I don't see any people made of stone unless you tell that all those guys in the museum were made by the Medusa.

296
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:32,929
Rym: but anyway the Christian missionaries and their converts would build their churches either out of or on top of all the old pagan temples So almost all these old pyramids and everything.

297
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:35,879
Rym: they dismantle them and use the stones to build big cathedrals and whatever.

298
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:41,339
Rym: and Basically, the only reason they didn't destroy this one is most likely that they didn't know it was there.

299
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,940
Scott: Maybe there was some smart Aztecs in the area who said oh shit and they buried their pyramid in dirt.

300
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:48,056
Rym: Yeah, we really don't know.

301
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:49,839
Rym: Hopefully we'll find out soon.

302
00:19:50,221 --> 00:20:02,919
Rym: The problem I have with stories like this is that I'm really interested in this kind of archaeology and I love it when they find cool things like this But the mainstream media almost never follows up with what they find out about the culture as a result of these finds because

303
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:04,204
Scott: that's usually Not interesting.

304
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:11,099
Rym: Yeah, so they'll say woot pyramid found or woot There's a thing in the Great Pyramid and then that is never talked about it again.

305
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:18,952
Scott: It's the same when you're playing like civilization - it's like your guys found a great old Spaceship or your guys found a spaceship.

306
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:20,560
Scott: Well, that's a Master of Orion game.

307
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:30,727
Scott: You'll find a spaceship You know a spaceship of an ancient alien race or you'll find a pyramid from an ancient civilization and then it'd be like the effect Is your research increases by two?

308
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:33,054
Scott: Yeah, no one cares about research increasing by two.

309
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:33,716
Scott: That's boring.

310
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:34,900
Rym: See I care.

311
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:37,074
Scott: Yeah, yeah you do.

312
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:37,679
Rym: Yeah, I do.

313
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:56,500
Rym: So if you don't know what that music is from I want to cry.

314
00:20:57,563 --> 00:20:59,259
Scott: I'm already crying and I do know what it's from.

315
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:04,314
Rym: Yeah, Lupin the third as a as a whole the whole entity that is Lupin.

316
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:11,522
Rym: the third is as we mentioned in our favorite Anime bit one of our favorite shows ever Shows.

317
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:15,515
Scott: I've read the manga animes movies mostly the movies.

318
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:19,640
Scott: Yeah, and the music Yeah, the all one songs.

319
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:24,515
Rym: So we just watched the fuma conspiracy for the third time.

320
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:27,707
Rym: It was only my second time Yeah, and you fell asleep during it.

321
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,020
Scott: I always seem to fall asleep watching Lupin movies late at night.

322
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,744
Scott: What's up with that?

323
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:33,595
Rym: You seem to fall asleep late at night in general.

324
00:21:34,097 --> 00:21:34,480
Scott: It's not cuz.

325
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:36,464
Scott: It's not cuz.

326
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,074
Scott: I don't like Lupin movies or anything.

327
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:38,980
Scott: I like them a whole lot.

328
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,506
Scott: It's just I'm tired.

329
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:46,550
Scott: I have a hard time staying awake when I'm motionless in front of a television But you're the one always suggests we watch those movies late at night.

330
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:48,257
Scott: Yeah, what's up with that?

331
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:48,980
Scott: I don't know.

332
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,022
Scott: It's just cuz.

333
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:50,864
Scott: I like them a lot.

334
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:55,340
Rym: Yeah, but anyway for those of you who are unaware we'll talk a bit about Lupin.

335
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:02,940
Scott: Lupin was created in the 60s or 70s a long time ago before we were born by this guy named monkey punch.

336
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:03,964
Scott: It's not his real name.

337
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:06,395
Scott: That's his manga writer name.

338
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:07,520
Scott: I don't know what his real name is.

339
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:10,554
Scott: He might even change his name to that but that's what he's known by like.

340
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:11,920
Scott: people say hey monkey punch.

341
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,486
Scott: They don't say hey what his real name is.

342
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:23,120
Scott: and he made a funny manga about this guy Who's an awesome thief and the manga is kind of different from the TV shows and the movies.

343
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,795
Rym: The manga is more like the anime pilot we saw.

344
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:39,359
Scott: yeah It's like Lupin kills people and he steals and he's you know He's much more dirty and mean and ger Like a Han who shoots first and not a Han who shoots second.

345
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:43,920
Rym: So I guess the main difference there is to give a kind of broad thing when it comes to Lupin movies.

346
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:47,339
Rym: Different people have been responsible for all different kinds of Lupin movies.

347
00:22:48,103 --> 00:23:02,997
Rym: It's like everyone takes their turn making a Lupin movie and depending on who did it they range from just full of T&A and boobies and and Scannily clad women to really heartwarming and serious and very ghibli esque or anything in between.

348
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:06,045
Scott: yep The TV shows.

349
00:23:06,105 --> 00:23:08,915
Scott: I think there's one season that you probably haven't seen.

350
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,180
Scott: that's really really old.

351
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:11,685
Scott: Where like it?

352
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:14,496
Scott: I think I've sung the music on the show before or maybe what is?

353
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:15,420
Scott: that was one of the pre-show?

354
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:18,124
Scott: It's well this.

355
00:23:18,225 --> 00:23:21,200
Scott: it's his old Japanese guy going loop on the third.

356
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:24,023
Scott: It's old.

357
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:24,968
Scott: it's really old.

358
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,500
Rym: Yeah, I don't think it was ever translated really by anyone.

359
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:31,880
Scott: I think there were a few fansubs on the internet that I saw once and they were not good.

360
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:34,517
Scott: This is like an old old TV show from the 70s.

361
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,643
Scott: You don't want to watch it.

362
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:42,880
Scott: the second series, which is the first series ended and then there was like, you know They didn't make any more and then they made it again.

363
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:45,080
Scott: And that's what you're gonna see on Cartoon Network.

364
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:52,723
Scott: And those are the TV DVDs you're buying in the store is the second season and the second season Of what I've seen of it is pretty good now.

365
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:57,270
Rym: It's campy and hilarious and just very very silly at times.

366
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:09,820
Rym: Casanova was the Santa Claus of sex But I mean basically it they've marketed is like here's the Lupin the TV show and they don't talk about the old series.

367
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:21,163
Rym: but the first episode of that Lupin that was on Cartoon Network is them all coming back together and Reminiscing about the past and then an old villain comes back to get them.

368
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:25,821
Scott: Mm-hmm and They don't like try to hide that fact at all.

369
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:31,559
Rym: You know, it's like, okay I'm just actually I got to say the dub is fairly well done.

370
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:40,790
Scott: Yeah, I watched the dub of Lupin TV, you know the Pretty good voice acting compared to most and the Japanese Lupin really isn't always that good.

371
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:51,750
Scott: I mean sometimes depending on what you watch There's like a base set of voice actors and sometimes people it's not the same voice actors But they get the voice so close because it's not particularly difficult that you don't notice.

372
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:58,410
Scott: But sometimes you watch certain things and the voices are just off from what you're used to for Lupin by a million miles.

373
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:02,830
Rym: Yeah, I forget which movie it was but Lupin had this really really deep annoying voice.

374
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,202
Rym: I mean, there's annoying voice anyway, but it was just deep and it was bothering me.

375
00:25:06,282 --> 00:25:12,438
Scott: Yeah, Lupin's voice is supposed to be like Like a crazy monkey guy whatever.

376
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,123
Rym: well, he is a crazy monkey guy.

377
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:14,745
Scott: that's the point.

378
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:22,050
Scott: but sometimes You know, he can always also be like, you know a little bit more serious, but his voice doesn't really change.

379
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:25,350
Scott: He just you know talks more less crazy.

380
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:28,281
Scott: Yeah, if that makes any sense at all.

381
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:30,230
Rym: Yeah, so what can we say about Lupin?

382
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,030
Rym: I guess we go through all the characters and kind of give you a rundown of what the show is actually about.

383
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:40,186
Rym: Yep, now Lupin the main guy the the the central center of all of this.

384
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:41,390
Scott: He's the third Lupin.

385
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,761
Scott: Yes, and there was indeed a Lupin the second and Lupin the first.

386
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:45,102
Rym: Yep.

387
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:47,570
Rym: He's the descendant of Arsene Lupin.

388
00:25:47,731 --> 00:25:54,806
Rym: Arsene Lupin, which is a real French guy, I think or no I think it's just the name of a French guy in a story that was written.

389
00:25:54,826 --> 00:26:06,229
Rym: Okay I mean the stories online fairly widely available the original story of Lupin the great thief Yep, and he is a. he's Japanese and he just runs around stealing things.

390
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:11,885
Rym: His basic personality changes from movie to movie episode episode, but he's a monkey man.

391
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:13,510
Rym: He's very good at what he does.

392
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,073
Rym: He's silly.

393
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:15,462
Rym: He likes Fujiko.

394
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:16,810
Scott: imagine James Bond.

395
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:25,150
Scott: But instead of being a secret agent who stops evil guys from taking over the world He's a thief who steals things not well somewhat to get things.

396
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,250
Scott: But he also basically just wants to steal things for the fun of stealing them.

397
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,190
Rym: Why do they attack the gas station for fun?

398
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:39,975
Scott: Yeah, but you know, he never gets the gold in the end because that's the way it is, you know now He's always after Fujiko.

399
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:44,670
Rym: Mine who is the the arch typical woman of the Lupin world.

400
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:53,961
Scott: Yet where James Bond goes after a different woman each movie and and always gets her in the bag Lupin goes after Fujiko in every movie depending on her hair color.

401
00:26:54,141 --> 00:26:57,150
Rym: Yeah, they always draw Fujiko very differently in every movie.

402
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,762
Rym: It's like a thing in the Lupin movie.

403
00:26:58,782 --> 00:26:59,870
Rym: She's always completely different.

404
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:06,470
Scott: Well, sometimes this is Fujiko drawing styles that appear more often than others, but she's different from here to there.

405
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,041
Rym: Well part of it is that she's supposed to be a master of disguise.

406
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:10,185
Scott: Oh, really?

407
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:11,250
Rym: Well, so is Lupin?

408
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:21,898
Rym: Oh Lupin is totally the master of disguise But almost every Lupin movie ends up with Fujiko in disguise actually working for the bad guy But then she screws up and gets kidnapped or something.

409
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,930
Rym: then he rescues her but then she steals it and then craziness.

410
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:29,305
Scott: Yeah, she basically Lupin never actually gets her, you know, like he wants.

411
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:32,410
Scott: but they you know They sort of have a romantic relationship.

412
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:35,610
Rym: The level of the relationship really varies depending on the movie.

413
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:42,809
Rym: It ranges from they have this unspoken bond between each other - he's after her body and she hates him and just wants his money.

414
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:47,750
Scott: It also ranges to where they're just friends and occasionally he goes ooh boobies.

415
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:55,910
Rym: Yeah Now other than in two Lupin movies and a couple of the TV episodes Fujiko serves as nothing more than a problem.

416
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:58,139
Scott: Yeah, I mean a couple of times.

417
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,104
Scott: she's really good.

418
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:06,542
Scott: whenever they're in prison She'll break them out or whenever they're about to die and there's no way out She'll appear and save them and let's go him on.

419
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:07,750
Scott: does it who we'll talk about in a minute?

420
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:13,201
Scott: Yep but other than that all she does is really make things difficult for Lupin.

421
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:25,420
Scott: like if she wasn't there he would steal a lot of freakin shit and She just gets in the way and then if they ever actually do steal something she always ends up getting Whatever loot they managed to escape with.

422
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:26,184
Scott: she gets it though.

423
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:27,610
Rym: Usually then she loses it anyway.

424
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:31,744
Scott: Yeah, sometimes she'll be like I got the only gold that we escaped with and the place is destroyed.

425
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:33,169
Scott: Oh, I lost it shit.

426
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:35,240
Scott: Now the pot is like great.

427
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,890
Scott: if you never showed up, I would have all the gold.

428
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:40,570
Rym: But yet he always has to go try to save her if she gets in trouble.

429
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:45,708
Rym: Of course, even though Jigen and going on don't want to usually yeah, they're smart.

430
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:48,740
Rym: now Lupin's best friend in the whole world is Jigen.

431
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,306
Scott: Jigen is awesome.

432
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:51,370
Rym: Yeah, he's my favorite character.

433
00:28:51,571 --> 00:29:00,909
Rym: Yeah, maybe now I'm not sure of his origin but in the live-action Lupin at least He was one of the members of the original crew of Lupin the second.

434
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:06,710
Rym: So he tracked down Lupin the third to try to get him to take up the mantle of you know, the Lupin thief, whatever.

435
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,663
Scott: I don't think that's the official because it always seems like Jigen wants to go away from Lupin because Lupin's being stupid.

436
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:18,890
Rym: No, cuz I a lot of the movies I mean Jigen always says he wants to go away, but he always follows Lupin anyway.

437
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:24,350
Scott: Yeah, but a lot of times what happens is Lupin wants to do some job and Jigen's like that job is stupid.

438
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,015
Scott: I'm not doing it.

439
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:26,709
Rym: Well, he's like that in the live-action, too.

440
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:29,157
Rym: Yeah, he wants him to be a proper thief like Lupin.

441
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:30,280
Rym: the second was hmm.

442
00:29:30,822 --> 00:29:32,467
Scott: He's basically this he's quiet.

443
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:36,022
Rym: He's cool You know half Japanese half American.

444
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,850
Scott: Yeah, he's got a little beard.

445
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,873
Scott: You don't see his eyes too often, but they do, you know It's cuz.

446
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:43,627
Scott: he has a hat that he wears low, but you do see his eyes and they're kind of funny.

447
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:44,250
Rym: He's a lush.

448
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:45,716
Scott: Yeah, he drinks a lot.

449
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:47,584
Scott: You know, he's they all smoke.

450
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:49,993
Scott: It seems like in this show He's ever go home.

451
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:50,816
Scott: I don't think he smokes.

452
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,220
Rym: He doesn't smoke drink or anything.

453
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,250
Scott: Yeah, but go G again is a master of guns.

454
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:59,806
Rym: Yeah, I mean if we're talking burning wheel he has gun as a trait.

455
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:01,030
Scott: It's a white.

456
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:10,350
Rym: I mean, it's white with a lot of big number next to it in a castle cagliostro They're they're about to have the final, you know big battle and he's standing there with going on.

457
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,298
Rym: We'll talk about in a minute.

458
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:19,448
Rym: and he says the words Don't worry with your sword and my anti-tank rifle and then he pulls out an anti-tank rifle.

459
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:22,196
Scott: Yeah It's just fantastic.

460
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:25,409
Scott: Usually has this revolver and he always pulls it out when he needs it.

461
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:28,721
Scott: And then he shoots and he never misses and all that good J.

462
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:30,708
Rym: He's the quiet stoic competent one.

463
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,284
Scott: Yep I liked you again a lot.

464
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:33,749
Scott: He's way cool.

465
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,825
Rym: Yeah, then there's going on who in the pilot was trying to kill Lupin.

466
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:41,093
Rym: He was sworn to kill Lupin the third Mm-hmm.

467
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:43,810
Rym: I don't know what was up with that and we never saw the first TV show.

468
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:45,289
Rym: So we don't know how that was resolved.

469
00:30:45,812 --> 00:31:08,370
Scott: Goemon is an honor bound traditional samurai guy living in modern times But he has a sword that depending on which show you're watching is either just a really normal sword or is incredibly magical and invincible and His skills depending, you know, no matter what you're watching are incredibly magical and invincible.

470
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:19,713
Rym: Basically his skill with the sword is the same level as Jigen skill with the gun and In any movie those two will be pegged at a level and that'll kind of determine how the movie is gonna go if it's gonna Be serious or silly.

471
00:31:19,974 --> 00:31:29,564
Scott: Yeah, like in some movies Goemon will run around cutting up trees occasionally cutting up rocks One time he cut an entire building cutting up people in crazy movies.

472
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:30,467
Scott: He cuts buildings.

473
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:36,110
Scott: He cuts airplanes While they're flying cuts cars cuts castle.

474
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:46,845
Rym: Yeah, though in them in the really really serious Lupin's he just has sword fights with other sword wielding guys Yeah, and sometimes he just you know beats them easily and does amazing stuff.

475
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,530
Scott: I like it when he does lots of crazy silly stuff.

476
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:50,056
Rym: Yeah, well, I like the over-the-top.

477
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,221
Rym: Whoo Lupin.

478
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,088
Scott: Yeah, that's the best bond to me.

479
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,418
Rym: The best pond the best pond.

480
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:56,121
Rym: I don't know.

481
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:56,984
Rym: I like kougepon.

482
00:31:57,265 --> 00:31:58,309
Scott: Yeah kougepons good too.

483
00:31:58,953 --> 00:32:00,944
Rym: Now that basically is the crew of Lupin.

484
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:11,829
Rym: there's in every movie There's always one extra character who is the the girl who at the plot surrounds and Lupin always falls in love with her Except in fuma conspiracy where going on has the girl?

485
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:17,745
Rym: Yeah, the fuma conspiracy is one of the best Lupin movies ever definitely now.

486
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:19,450
Rym: I mean, that's the main crew.

487
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:20,879
Rym: No, the only other bar.

488
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,785
Rym: No, that's the crew.

489
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:30,576
Rym: now There's one more character who's kind of a member of the crew, but not really it depends on what's going on And he's my man Zenigata.

490
00:32:30,997 --> 00:32:35,510
Scott: now at first when you watch Lupin you think Zenigata who he what he is.

491
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,886
Scott: He's an inner pole detective and he's in charge of catching Lupin.

492
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:39,529
Scott: That's all he does.

493
00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:45,568
Rym: He is like the stereotypical Japanese salary man in that he is just dedicated to his job above all else.

494
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:54,164
Scott: now At first you think you know Zenigata is just a comic relief Goofy detective who can't do anything, you know, he sucks.

495
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:55,088
Scott: He always loses etc.

496
00:32:56,192 --> 00:33:02,850
Scott: But once you learn about Zenigata and maybe you see a few other Lupin's you start to realize he's freaking awesome.

497
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:05,482
Rym: Yeah, I mean he always knows where Lupin is.

498
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,229
Rym: He catches him almost every time.

499
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:10,508
Rym: Yeah, I think is all the people under him either don't believe him or stupid.

500
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:14,781
Scott: if Zenigata was after anyone with less skill than Lupin.

501
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:16,547
Scott: He would bag them in a second.

502
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:18,373
Scott: You don't even realize You know the it's.

503
00:33:18,393 --> 00:33:23,110
Scott: the only reason he can't catch Lupin is because he's fucking Lupin and he's so good, you know.

504
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:36,229
Rym: Yeah, I mean his life is dedicated to catching Lupin to the point that in one of them in fact is in fuma conspiracy He thinks Lupin is dead So he becomes a monk and just sits there Chanting over Lupin's soul for all of eternity because he has no more reason to live.

505
00:33:36,652 --> 00:33:40,570
Scott: There are a lot of times we're like someone's gonna kill Lupin and he's like no we have to catch him.

506
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,506
Scott: We can't kill him because then he can't get out and I won't be able to catch me.

507
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:55,546
Rym: Yep Plus there's a lot of times where Lupin's crew and Zenigata will have some sort of thing going on where like they both realize that the real enemy is over there and Have an unspoken truce for a little while now.

508
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,582
Scott: Here's something interesting that I found out on the Wikipedia and some other places.

509
00:34:00,024 --> 00:34:01,650
Scott: There's actually an old Japanese.

510
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:05,910
Scott: I think it might be a TV show or a book or something where there was another character.

511
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,783
Scott: I think his name was Zenigata or something else like close to Zenigata.

512
00:34:09,822 --> 00:34:16,976
Scott: that Zenigata was based on this old Japanese detective character and the old Japanese detective character He's based on.

513
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:19,734
Scott: all he did was throw coins To catch guys.

514
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:24,449
Scott: like he would throw coins at guys and like knock him out or hurt him real bad and they'd fall over.

515
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,188
Scott: Or he'd knock guns out of people's hands by throwing coins.

516
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:36,000
Scott: Zenigata does the same thing by throwing handcuffs and if you know about the old classic Japanese character Then you know about Zenigata.

517
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:48,810
Scott: and when he throws the handcuffs to catch Lupin It's funny because they're making a joke about this old guy and that's not something you'll notice if you're just an American anime fan watching Lupin, yeah Now in terms of the movies.

518
00:34:49,031 --> 00:34:56,221
Rym: I mean we could definitely rank them and I guess we'll just throw out the names of the ones that if you don't know anything About Lupin you should see these movies probably in the order.

519
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:57,164
Rym: We're about to say them.

520
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:58,650
Scott: Well, you already said Fuma conspiracy.

521
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:02,625
Rym: Yeah, but the Fuma conspiracy and the castle Cagliostro.

522
00:35:02,785 --> 00:35:05,551
Scott: Yeah, that's the one that's made by Ghibli.

523
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:14,196
Rym: Yeah, those two are widely considered to be the best that Lupin has to offer in terms of funny yet Serious just good solid movies.

524
00:35:14,497 --> 00:35:17,867
Scott: Yep, if you see no other Lupin watch those two movies.

525
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:21,419
Rym: now There's also Babylon gold, which is probably.

526
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:22,604
Rym: that's the one Lupin.

527
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:23,366
Scott: You don't want to see?

528
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:28,390
Rym: well, let me put it this way It's the worst Lupin ever made as far as I can tell because there's a lot of Lupin.

529
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:30,609
Rym: It's at the bottom bottom bottom of the list.

530
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:41,207
Scott: motorcycles riding on a clown face a giant clown face not Exaggerating motorcycle chase on a clown face and the giant pyramid of gold and a goddess.

531
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:44,041
Scott: and yeah That one is just crazy and silly like.

532
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:44,564
Scott: but you know what?

533
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:45,670
Rym: It's still fun to watch.

534
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:49,110
Scott: It's still funny just because it's so crazy and so silly.

535
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,030
Scott: It's just beyond the level of craziness and silliness that you want now.

536
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,114
Rym: What was the one with mom.

537
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:56,703
Rym: Oh in it the secret of mom secret of mom?

538
00:35:56,723 --> 00:35:57,566
Rym: Oh, that one's good.

539
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:58,269
Scott: That one's okay.

540
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:02,486
Scott: Most of the other ones that we haven't mentioned any Lupin movie is okay.

541
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:05,631
Scott: There's one with Air Mafrodyte.

542
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:07,197
Scott: Oh, that's a great one.

543
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,004
Scott: That's that's just a terrific one.

544
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:10,470
Rym: That was the one in the desert, right?

545
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:13,459
Scott: It might it might be that's one of the newer ones.

546
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,508
Scott: There's all the big muscly guy in the helicopter.

547
00:36:15,729 --> 00:36:17,001
Rym: Yeah Yeah, that was that one.

548
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:22,629
Rym: Mm-hmm Basically any Lupin movie you ever see that isn't Babylon gold is worth picking up.

549
00:36:23,192 --> 00:36:26,305
Scott: All of them are available on DVD in this country at least most of them are.

550
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:27,249
Scott: there are a few.

551
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:27,914
Scott: See.

552
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:30,210
Scott: the thing is all these to you look like normal movies.

553
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:31,735
Scott: Some of them were theater movies.

554
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:34,083
Scott: some of them were TV movies in Japan.

555
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:36,270
Scott: some of them are OAV movies in Japan.

556
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,302
Scott: Yeah, but to us they're all 90-minute to 2-hour something movies.

557
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:42,830
Scott: Some of them actually get pretty long, you know, depending.

558
00:36:43,472 --> 00:36:45,459
Rym: But yeah, the one with the giant brain at the end.

559
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,041
Scott: That's mom.

560
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:46,703
Scott: Oh, yeah.

561
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:47,145
Rym: Yeah.

562
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:48,550
Rym: Mom was probably the longest one.

563
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:51,644
Scott: Yeah, some of them can get a little long, but they're all good.

564
00:36:51,886 --> 00:37:00,110
Scott: No matter how long they are Just make sure you don't watch them too late at night or else you'll fall asleep And not because it's bad because it's too late and don't watch Babylon gold until you've seen some other.

565
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:03,610
Rym: Otherwise you might get a bad impression because that movie is kind of bad.

566
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:09,350
Scott: Well, at least people listening to this won't get a bad impression because we told them but don't show it to anyone else first.

567
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:12,767
Rym: Yeah, that's like showing someone Excel saga if they've never seen anime before.

568
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:21,809
Scott: yep And do watch the as much of the second TV series of Lupin as you can and don't worry They're not in any particular order so you can just pick up any DVDs you want.

569
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:25,248
Rym: Yep, in fact, I'd say if you can watch them on Cartoon Network if they're showing them.

570
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,650
Scott: Yeah I don't know if they're showing them anymore.

571
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,382
Scott: We watched them on Cartoon Network when they first showed him.

572
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,250
Scott: Yeah until they started to rerun them.

573
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,549
Rym: Yeah, they showed him at midnight and we'd all huddle around plug our TV into the wall just so we could watch it.

574
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,550
Scott: Yep There is one thing to know though.

575
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,790
Scott: There was an episode in the second series that they didn't show on Cartoon Network in the first go-around.

576
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:50,216
Scott: I think that involved a lot of Nazis and stuff and it was supposed to be this big Nazi joke Yeah, and I don't know.

577
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:54,910
Scott: I think it eventually did make it onto one of the DVDs somewhere but not in the correct order.

578
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:57,284
Rym: Yeah stuff like that happens at least it's in there.

579
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:58,250
Rym: it finally came out.

580
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:09,805
Scott: what was really funny was that if you watch the shows when you watch them on Cartoon Network you would watch and After like episode 4 they'd be like next episode crazy Nazis and the next episode wasn't crazy Nazis.

581
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:11,269
Scott: Yeah, that was good.

582
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:17,270
Rym: Now my only real big piece of advice here is that if you're gonna watch Lupin don't watch it alone.

583
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:24,189
Rym: I mean you can but The more people are in the room at the same time you have a Lupin movie on the more you're going to enjoy it.

584
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:27,610
Scott: It's really not something you can enjoy by yourself.

585
00:38:27,756 --> 00:38:34,714
Rym: I mean I mean, I remember watching Castle Cagliostro with the RIT Anime Club and at that showing they were like 80 90 Maybe a hundred people in the room.

586
00:38:35,537 --> 00:38:39,730
Rym: It was crazy people yelling and screaming and cheering every time something happened.

587
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:51,010
Scott: I don't understand what it is but when someone you know is in a car chase and A guy jumps out from behind the wall and cuts up the car in the rear with a sword and you're just watching it.

588
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:52,890
Scott: It's just like okay, whatever.

589
00:38:52,950 --> 00:39:00,399
Scott: But when you're watching it with a hundred people and some guy jumps out and cuts up a car with a sword Leaving the driver just in his underpants.

590
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,806
Scott: Everyone just starts cracking up everywhere.

591
00:39:02,826 --> 00:39:05,589
Scott: I don't know what the hell it is But there you have it.

592
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,683
Rym: Yeah consider that advice.

593
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:15,063
Rym: in general Very few anime need the silence of you know Like the otaku sitting in his room watching in the perfect environment to get every detail.

594
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:18,153
Rym: most anime is best enjoyed in a crowd Mm-hmm.

595
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:20,142
Rym: I mean there are exceptions like mushishi.

596
00:39:20,182 --> 00:39:21,729
Rym: I think is good to watch with a small group.

597
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,585
Scott: Yeah, the only other thing about Lupin is the manga which I honestly haven't read much of.

598
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:33,429
Scott: I think I read part of the first Volume that Tokyo pop ever printed and that was it and it wasn't cuz I didn't like it.

599
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,270
Scott: It was just because there's so much of it.

600
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:40,407
Scott: It's not really and it wasn't good enough to warrant paying all that money for all those volumes.

601
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,130
Scott: You know what I mean?

602
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,609
Rym: Yeah, it's the kind of thing if you see a deal at a con just pick it up.

603
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:47,643
Scott: Yeah, you might be able to get a whole mess of Lupin.

604
00:39:47,663 --> 00:39:49,050
Scott: maybe I'll try to do that at Otakon.

605
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,549
Rym: I was gonna do that at Otakon.

606
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:55,274
Scott: All right, they actually there's like two or three series of it now so you can get one of them and I can get one Of them or something.

607
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:55,857
Rym: Yeah.

608
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:08,946
Scott: But anyway, there's a whole lot of it and It's got the same characters as all the movies and TV shows, but it's a little darker and a little more evil and But the humor is a lot darker.

609
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:14,265
Scott: basically Yeah Like Lupin will shoot down a bunch of people with an assault rifle and they'd be bloody everywhere.

610
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:18,400
Scott: and the TV shows and movies Lupin tends to be more like Batman where he won't kill anyone.

611
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:24,384
Rym: Yeah, like in the darker even the darkest Lupin movies He doesn't kill people outright so much as by inaction.

612
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:25,750
Rym: a bunch of people around him might die.

613
00:40:26,212 --> 00:40:30,990
Scott: Yeah, like in the TV show Lupin won't you know blow a bunch of people up or shoot anyone?

614
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:37,130
Scott: But if there's a bomb he'll just escape and let the whole shit blow up like in the first episode of the second.

615
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:41,395
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I totally forgot.

616
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:44,067
Rym: everyone on that cruise ship died except Lupin and his crew.

617
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:47,708
Scott: Yeah Well, I guess some of them might have got away in lifeboats, but not many.

618
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:52,588
Scott: I mean Lupin doesn't even kill Zenigata.

619
00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:53,872
Scott: He you know, he just let's see.

620
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:54,534
Rym: Well, he couldn't.

621
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:57,104
Rym: I mean they're friends when it comes down To it there.

622
00:40:57,124 --> 00:41:06,019
Scott: In fact, I think there was one movie actually where like Zenigata was down to dump So he lost his job or something and then he was with Lupin or we pawn helped him out.

623
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:18,452
Rym: Yep Well in Cagliostro, Zenigata plays a big role because Cagliostro to not ruin anything but basically it most of it takes place in this scary kind of country like this castley evil weird country.

624
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:23,520
Rym: and Zenigata goes there because he knows Lupin's there and even he is like whoa.

625
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,792
Rym: This place isn't right and he's kind of on Lupin side.

626
00:41:27,314 --> 00:41:36,260
Scott: Yeah, what generally happens is Some Lupin's Zenigata is highly involved like it's about Zenigata and Lupin running away from him.

627
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:52,240
Scott: but some of them Zenigata just appears once or twice to make a little plot twist or force Lupin to change directions or take a turn or To add a chase scene where otherwise it would be boring You know because it doesn't make sense for the real bad guy to be there.

628
00:41:52,420 --> 00:42:10,240
Scott: but every Lupin movie has a real bad guy who is neither Zenigata nor Lupin and Sometimes that bad guy is recognized by Zenigata and Zenigata and Lupin will semi Team up to beat that bad guy and then right at the end Zenigata We'll try to catch Lupin and Lupin will get away and the movie will be over.

629
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,820
Rym: Yeah, almost every Lupin movie ends with Zenigata chasing Lupin into the sunset.

630
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:17,899
Scott: Yeah, I'd say about more than half of them end that way.

631
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:27,004
Rym: Yeah, I mean some of the movies are about other characters like there's the Fuma conspiracy kind of follows Goemon and his wife-to-be Mm-hmm.

632
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:30,479
Rym: There's one movie where Fujiko loses her memory and the whole movie is basically about her.

633
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:42,420
Scott: Yeah, different characters have different amounts of You know importance depending on the movie, you know, Lupin never really has any movie where he's particularly important.

634
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:50,452
Rym: Well other than the fact that he's generally the plot mover Yeah, it's like he's the total protagonist but nothing.

635
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:53,920
Scott: the plot never really involves him or his past directly.

636
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,760
Scott: It's always him doing stuff and stealing things against other forces.

637
00:42:59,882 --> 00:43:08,545
Rym: You know, yeah now of Lupin, I mean my favorite Lupin movies are the ones that focus mostly on Lupin and Jigen Two of them doing stuff.

638
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:10,892
Rym: I mean Zenigata and everyone else are around.

639
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:15,479
Rym: but I like the movies that just follow these two mostly Mm-hmm.

640
00:43:15,821 --> 00:43:21,220
Scott: One of the best ones was that one where they were in Brazil first and there was like a carnival and Zenigata was there.

641
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:27,140
Rym: Oh, yeah, the one that started really like weird and creepily with like Zenigata chasing Lupin through the carnival slowly.

642
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:34,346
Scott: Yeah, if you want if you don't believe what I said before about Zenigata actually being awesome the beginning of this movie Well is where Zenigata is awesome.

643
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:34,908
Rym: Wasn't that?

644
00:43:34,948 --> 00:43:36,533
Rym: Not really Zenigata or something?

645
00:43:37,235 --> 00:43:42,412
Scott: Yeah, it was really weird and It's actually on DVD in this country.

646
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:43,680
Scott: I think it was something I downloaded.

647
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,664
Rym: Still have it.

648
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,810
Rym: I kind of want to watch it again.

649
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,140
Scott: Maybe I remember it had some really good scenes.

650
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,366
Scott: We're like there was a fake date.

651
00:43:49,466 --> 00:43:56,980
Scott: Lupin and friends set up a fake house to fool I remember and then it fell over and it was just hilarious.

652
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,558
Scott: Wasn't that the one we're at the end?

653
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,554
Scott: There was the like they were going at the Lupin treasure.

654
00:44:01,675 --> 00:44:02,479
Scott: or was that a different one?

655
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,825
Rym: I think that was a different one.

656
00:44:04,067 --> 00:44:04,489
Scott: Okay, you know what?

657
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:05,837
Rym: There's so many Lupin movies.

658
00:44:05,897 --> 00:44:06,440
Rym: I lose track.

659
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:07,987
Scott: I just all blur together.

660
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:10,960
Rym: just watch as much Lupin as you can in whatever order you can find it.

661
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,996
Scott: Yeah, there's also the assassin one with the island and the submarines and the girl.

662
00:44:15,016 --> 00:44:19,532
Rym: Yeah What a girl that doesn't help the blonde girl with the short hair.

663
00:44:19,672 --> 00:44:21,278
Rym: Yeah, there's also the one with James Bond.

664
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:26,380
Scott: Yeah The pond is awesome.

665
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:30,933
Scott: If you don't know about Lupin or you don't haven't watched the pond or anything.

666
00:44:30,993 --> 00:44:37,039
Scott: if you like anime or you like funny things So you like James Bond or any watch freaking Lupin?

667
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,103
Rym: all right now a last little bit.

668
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:45,140
Rym: you might wonder why we suddenly decided to talk about Lupin and Dominally, it's because we just watched the fuma conspiracy again.

669
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:58,139
Rym: but really it's because we've got a lot of anime to review and we've been watching it and Today we sat down and we watched a bunch of shows and we didn't see enough of any one show to actually talk about it.

670
00:44:58,521 --> 00:44:59,505
Rym: We want those.

671
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:00,711
Scott: I don't want to see more.

672
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,700
Rym: Yeah that one show we watched in a whole episode.

673
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:05,437
Rym: It didn't go anywhere and we're still not sure what the show is about.

674
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:08,159
Scott: really Well, I do know that it's about pretty boys.

675
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:13,480
Rym: Yeah, but we're not sure if it's pretty boys kissing or just happens to be pretty boys and then they fight.

676
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:17,160
Scott: I have a feeling the show is not targeted at us straight older males.

677
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:23,620
Rym: No, and then we're still watching ergo proxy and we still haven't seen enough to know if it's good or not.

678
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,060
Scott: But I do know the second episode got me a lot more interested in the first episode.

679
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,972
Rym: Yeah, because the first episode was you know, they set everything up weird like what's going on?

680
00:45:31,414 --> 00:45:31,795
Rym: Okay.

681
00:45:31,835 --> 00:45:35,005
Rym: It's just dramatic scene goth Looking girl cool music.

682
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:37,434
Rym: dramatic scene cool music goth looking girl.

683
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,300
Scott: The second episode made freaking sense.

684
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:45,300
Rym: Yeah, like suddenly there was a plot like an actual plot and characters were doing things other than striking poses and it was a good.

685
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:53,706
Rym: Yeah Definitely gonna watch episode 3 and before and once we've seen enough episodes to know what the hell's going on We're gonna talk about ergo proxy.

686
00:45:53,726 --> 00:45:54,248
Rym: So hold out.

687
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:57,120
Scott: and there was another show we watched which you don't need to see more.

688
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:58,969
Rym: Oh god, the one we're gonna talk about.

689
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:12,340
Rym: Yeah next time probably This is a show that masqueraded as a cute funny asa manga dial like show but actually it's just pedophile horrible disgusting creepy not funny harem stupid.

690
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,038
Rym: Many adjectives.

691
00:46:14,743 --> 00:46:16,532
Scott: Yeah, I think there were fives.

692
00:46:16,814 --> 00:46:18,060
Scott: We'll talk about it when we talk about.

693
00:46:18,082 --> 00:46:19,002
Scott: Yeah God.

694
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:20,607
Rym: and a last little anime.

695
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:24,731
Rym: bit of news for any of you who are planning to attend Otakon the hotels are all fucking sold out.

696
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:32,933
Rym: You by the way, the artist's alley isn't sold out not as of our recording Which you might not hear this episode for several weeks.

697
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:42,696
Scott: So yeah, but If you're an artist and you want a table go get one because you know we could have taken a table if you wanted but we didn't have anything to do with it.

698
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:44,564
Scott: and I didn't want to take a Table away from an artist.

699
00:46:45,026 --> 00:46:48,660
Scott: and now I kind of feel bad because well, no artist is taking the table.

700
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,928
Scott: So frickin artists take the tables.

701
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:59,940
Rym: Yeah, cuz seriously we might just take the free table They're gonna offer us and we'll just dump business cards on it and maybe a tape playing us doing GeekNights.

702
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,402
Rym: I don't know.

703
00:47:00,422 --> 00:47:01,505
Scott: I don't know either.

704
00:47:01,525 --> 00:47:02,810
Scott: Maybe we'll sit at it occasionally.

705
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,877
Rym: Yeah, it'll be our base of operations.

706
00:47:05,178 --> 00:47:06,781
Scott: Yeah Whatever.

707
00:47:07,103 --> 00:47:08,832
Scott: yeah, I want more artists to be.

708
00:47:08,852 --> 00:47:15,752
Scott: and if they're gonna make artists alley bigger Which I think they did and they added more tables to it I want it to be full because that makes the con better for me.

709
00:47:16,374 --> 00:47:19,105
Rym: and while you're at it if you're an artist Yeah, my last metabit.

710
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:19,808
Rym: We got a lot of bits.

711
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,196
Rym: if you're an artist and you're any good even if you're not good We don't care.

712
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:35,400
Rym: We have a lot of friends who are artists and they're all fairly amazing in various ways and all of them said at one point Yeah, we'll make a logo for GeekNights and none of them have actually done it except one.

713
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:39,414
Rym: One person actually did something for us and that person is awesome.

714
00:47:39,915 --> 00:47:41,300
Rym: She posted in the forums a while ago.

715
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,556
Rym: I'll bump it up so you can all see.

716
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:50,494
Rym: If anyone makes us a logo or something We'd be very happy and appreciative and we talked about it on the show here.

717
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:52,000
Scott: Let's give them a little bit of direction.

718
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:57,625
Scott: All right, it needs to be some sort of logo that can go in a square, you know Like an out like I think.

719
00:47:57,786 --> 00:47:59,172
Scott: make it like it's a CD cover.

720
00:47:59,232 --> 00:48:10,740
Scott: if there was gonna be a GeekNights CD Make the cover for that CD because that's the shape and Type of design that we need to go into the mp3s for iTunes and all the feeds and all that BS.

721
00:48:11,461 --> 00:48:16,260
Scott: But also if you go to the forums, which have been getting one or two new users a day, which is way cool

722
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:25,198
Rym: Yeah They're actually getting really kind of big like to the point where if it keeps growing at this rate We're gonna have to start appointing people maybe to be moderators like big forums do and all that sort of.

723
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,080
Scott: yeah Like I can go there every few hours and there'll be a new post.

724
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,806
Scott: It used to be a new post every few days.

725
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:32,716
Scott: So way to go at front row crew comm slash forum.

726
00:48:33,097 --> 00:48:37,600
Scott: Yeah anyway So we want a logo that that's that size and shape.

727
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:50,800
Scott: But also if you go to the forums and you look at the top of the forums how it's sort of like this blue Dark blue to lighter blue gradient we need are the new website that I'm designing Which is mostly done has the same thing at the top of it.

728
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,660
Scott: So if the logo looks good against that background, that would be excellent.

729
00:48:56,486 --> 00:49:04,400
Scott: And then we're also thinking maybe like We'll have like that slight variations of the logo for each different day of GeekNights.

730
00:49:04,701 --> 00:49:11,687
Scott: It's like we'll have GeekNights Monday, which I have like a little flask with little bubblies coming out of it or something Or GeekNights Tuesday.

731
00:49:11,727 --> 00:49:13,213
Scott: We'll have like a little NES controller.

732
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:13,875
Scott: Who knows?

733
00:49:13,895 --> 00:49:15,100
Rym: Yeah, we're not sure yet.

734
00:49:15,241 --> 00:49:22,000
Scott: Yeah, everything's really just ideas I'm throwing out there in case artists are looking for direction instead of just shooting blanks in the dark.

735
00:49:22,281 --> 00:49:29,969
Rym: Yeah, just mainly because the fact that I mean we're appearing at Tora con we're appearing at Otakon We're appearing at Katsucon next year.

736
00:49:29,989 --> 00:49:32,136
Rym: We're appearing at an amazement.

737
00:49:32,196 --> 00:49:34,042
Rym: least one of us are we're.

738
00:49:34,062 --> 00:49:42,867
Rym: we're starting to really be around a lot and we kind of have to have things like business cards and flyers and and Banners and things for these events.

739
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,800
Rym: So we kind of have to move on this whole art thing.

740
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:58,440
Scott: yeah, and There are a lot of websites out there where I could pay a hundred bucks and they would have professional graphic designers all You know sketch out logos and we can pick which one we liked and then they would give it to us if we liked it.

741
00:49:58,723 --> 00:50:01,665
Scott: You know for the hundred dollars but I really don't want to do that.

742
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:13,534
Scott: if I have the alternative of like giving an artist friend or artist fan like 50 bucks or 25 bucks or whatever Yeah at some point we might announce an actual contest like we are looking for this and this.

743
00:50:13,835 --> 00:50:18,275
Rym: the prizes are X and Y. Here are the details in the forum, but we're not at that stage yet.

744
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:19,180
Rym: We're still very up in the air.

745
00:50:19,441 --> 00:50:24,898
Scott: It's really weird because usually my problem with art is I can imagine an image in my mind and then I can.

746
00:50:25,078 --> 00:50:27,180
Scott: I just can't Put it on a paper or on the thing.

747
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,632
Rym: How many logos have we come up with and we both look at him?

748
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:30,336
Rym: Like is that good?

749
00:50:30,356 --> 00:50:31,080
Rym: I don't know.

750
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:32,545
Rym: Do we should we use it?

751
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:33,912
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

752
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:35,339
Scott: I'm not I don't know what's good.

753
00:50:35,964 --> 00:50:38,239
Scott: You know, it's like if I see something good, I know it when I see it.

754
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,940
Scott: But so far nothing I've come up with is something that I see and is good.

755
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:44,572
Scott: Like I've come up with some things like all.

756
00:50:44,592 --> 00:50:45,980
Scott: right, we need to come on geek and night.

757
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:52,512
Scott: Well, maybe I'll make a crescent moon for night and then I'll sort of add a geeky thing to the bottom of the moon.

758
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:55,845
Scott: that because it turns into a G because a crescent Moon is like a C.

759
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:58,118
Rym: Yeah, you ended up adding a lens flare, I believe.

760
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:05,477
Scott: yeah No But like if you make a letter C With a crescent moon to look like night and then you put an NES controller on the bottom pointy bit.

761
00:51:05,517 --> 00:51:08,047
Scott: It looks like a G. What a how I know.

762
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:09,055
Scott: I know I'm not an artist.

763
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:17,431
Rym: Yeah We just thought we'd bring it up today because it's anime day and we found that there seems to be a high Correlation between people who are good at drawing and people who like anime.

764
00:51:17,893 --> 00:51:19,660
Scott: there is indeed at least among our friends.
