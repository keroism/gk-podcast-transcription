00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,098
Rym: It's Thursday, July 22nd.

2
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:11,860
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,563
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:18,074
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, our review of the book club book, The Lies of Locke Lamora.

5
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:22,260
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,390
Rym: So we had this discussion just before doing the show.

7
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:34,214
Rym: Scott didn't want to do the news bit because he basically said, "Yeah, nothing happened.

8
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:34,736
Rym: I don't have

9
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:35,158
Rym: anything.".

10
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:44,968
Rym: So Scott, my question to you is, has nothing in the entire world, any news elicited any opinion whatsoever from you?

11
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:46,677
Scott: I'm scrolling on the Google News.

12
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:49,414
Scott: So if there is such a news, which there may be- So nothing.

13
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:51,547
Rym: You don't care about the fact that BP was basically caught.

14
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,663
Rym: You know when they were injecting all that stuff to try to kill the well?

15
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:59,303
Rym: The stuff they injected was toxic waste that they normally couldn't legally dump.

16
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:07,646
Rym: And supposedly, according to the news now, they used the kind of special permission they got- Is this on the real news or is this on the hippie news?

17
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:08,292
Scott: made up stuff?

18
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:09,059
Rym: This is on the real news.

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:09,700
Scott: Okay.

20
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:14,458
Scott: Because I'm seeing lately a lot of- Did you see that Onion article?

21
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:20,369
Rym: they got picked up by a bunch of right wing blogs and people are taking it seriously about like- That happens like every day.

22
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:21,415
Rym: You know what?

23
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:22,702
Rym: I've noticed something weird about that.

24
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:33,468
Rym: Is it just me or when the onion gets taken seriously, like someone's stupid and thinks it's real, why is it almost always the far right that takes it too seriously as opposed to the far left?

25
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:34,596
Scott: Because they're- You know what?

26
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:41,300
Rym: I was reading a- It's like they're both crazy, but I feel like they're crazy in like very pathologically different ways.

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,448
Scott: This reminds me of two things I read recently.

28
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:52,188
Scott: Number one, there were some people discussing that there's a- They always look for like discrimination in colleges, mostly because colleges brag about diversity.

29
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:57,840
Rym: So therefore- What was that one college where they caught them photoshopping black people into their- Right, exactly.

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:05,588
Scott: But you know, the colleges brag about diversity on campus, so therefore they get heavily scrutinized in terms of the actual diversity.

31
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:13,802
Scott: And it turns out that yes indeed, statistically speaking, a lot of these colleges, what they're doing is they're not discriminating against white people.

32
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,809
Scott: There's plenty of white people there, right?

33
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:19,564
Scott: Is they're discriminating against white people from the sticks?

34
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:22,313
Scott: You know, these right wing type people.

35
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:24,441
Scott: And like if you look- No, no, no.

36
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:28,719
Rym: Is it discrimination or is it just those are not the kind of people who tend to get into colleges?

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:38,619
Scott: So there was a study and it showed that Asian and white people, at least in the US, when they apply to colleges, if you want to be accepted, you need much better grades.

38
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:48,320
Scott: Whereas if you were something else, African-American, Hispanic, anything except white and Asian, you could actually get into the same school with much lower grades and you would be accepted.

39
00:02:49,020 --> 00:03:01,553
Scott: And the thing was, is that actually also what they've noticed, which is the main problem here, these right wing people, right, is if you're a white person from the sticks, it's actually harder to get into the schools, right?

40
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:05,450
Scott: It's like they want to bring in and be able to say our campus is so diverse.

41
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:10,400
Scott: So they kick out the white people from the sticks and they bring in anyone else who's not white.

42
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:16,060
Rym: I think the real trouble is that the standards, at least for university, should be the same.

43
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,639
Rym: If you have the ability, go for it.

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:17,961
Scott: Yeah.

45
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:23,163
Scott: I don't like, you know, they can brag about having a diverse campus or whatever, but that's just

46
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:23,646
Scott: B.S.,

47
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:23,907
Scott: right?

48
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:24,771
Scott: They should accept.

49
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:25,414
Scott: they should not.

50
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:27,744
Rym: That's marketing to the parents and the high school.

51
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:28,286
Scott: Exactly.

52
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:30,474
Scott: They shouldn't even like, no.

53
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:35,517
Scott: When you're employing people in the real world, you're not allowed to even use that as criteria.

54
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:35,738
Scott: Right.

55
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:36,904
Scott: The college should be the same way.

56
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,035
Scott: They shouldn't even know what color you are.

57
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,738
Scott: Maybe they shouldn't be like, you know, they send in your application and you need to put down your name.

58
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:49,503
Scott: And sometimes they give stuff away like if your name is like, you know, like, you know, like my friend Luther Wang.

59
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:49,724
Scott: Right.

60
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:50,568
Scott: There is no question.

61
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:51,272
Rym: No question.

62
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:56,172
Scott: You know, you know, he's a Jew just from his name, you know, or like Tony Zhao.

63
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:58,199
Scott: Obviously, that guy is French.

64
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,222
Scott: There is no question.

65
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:03,015
Rym: So, you know, it is pronounced Thibodeau.

66
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:03,416
Scott: Right.

67
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:14,536
Rym: But the thing is, remember, the reason we had these sorts of affirmative policies before was to give people a shot to kind of reduce the built in discrimination from previous areas.

68
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:15,259
Scott: But it's like.

69
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,529
Scott: it's like a Band-Aid and it's not curing the.

70
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,795
Scott: it's like you had a Band-Aid.

71
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,947
Scott: So you don't see that there's like this gaping wound.

72
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:23,302
Scott: And every time we lift up the Band-Aid, the wound is still there.

73
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:24,647
Scott: Well, it's like, look, yep.

74
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:32,553
Scott: If we it's like, oh, if we made a meritocracy, then the black people, there's still not it's.

75
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,577
Scott: And we still it's like.

76
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,309
Scott: basically we're hiding the fact that we can't fix the real problem.

77
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,655
Rym: I know it or didn't it.

78
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:50,632
Rym: I mean, is it not possible to say that it did a lot of good from the 60s and 70s where racism was so endemic of getting people onto an equal footing to the point where eventually we can pull these things back and say, all right, everyone starts with the same shot.

79
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:56,319
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, you know, the public school situation is completely different from the university situation.

80
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:07,005
Scott: You know, I mean, basically the problem was then was that there were people who wanted to get into university and deserve to be in university, but couldn't because there really was outright horrible discrimination.

81
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:10,318
Scott: And we've mostly succeeded in getting rid of that.

82
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,951
Scott: And it's still out there and we still got to get rid of that shit.

83
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:18,078
Scott: But, you know, like there's still like golf courses that don't want people coming on and shit like that.

84
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,103
Rym: They don't want me to golf.

85
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:19,506
Scott: Yeah.

86
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:22,039
Scott: Well, I mean, they they'll be like, no women on this golf course.

87
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,046
Scott: There's still those still exist and it sucks ass.

88
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,836
Scott: But at the same time, right.

89
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:32,086
Scott: It's like, well, you're really just didn't do so well in high school.

90
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:41,141
Scott: And you're obviously, you know, not white.

91
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:44,472
Scott: So we're going to let you in anyway.

92
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:50,599
Scott: And then, you know, I want to see, you know, if they show me some, you know, this is, I don't know, is there a study on this?

93
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,443
Scott: I'd be very interested.

94
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:52,710
Rym: There's tons of studies on this.

95
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:55,646
Scott: No, no, no studies on whether those people actually do well.

96
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:55,867
Scott: Yes.

97
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:56,872
Rym: There's tons of studies.

98
00:05:56,912 --> 00:06:05,547
Rym: by and large people who are given some sort of non merit based scholarship tend to not do well or not graduate compared to people who had merit based scholarships.

99
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,657
Scott: Oh, so they are actually not doing well.

100
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:08,280
Scott: Yeah.

101
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:10,689
Scott: Oh, so again, so sadly, right?

102
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:18,725
Scott: Like I was going to say, I wish that the study would say that, look, we get them into college even though they didn't do so well in high school and then they do well.

103
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:23,630
Scott: So it, you know, it's not, it's okay to accept the people with the lower grades because it works out in the end.

104
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:27,454
Scott: You are actually helping them, but if they're not doing well in the college, well, it's like, ah, fuck.

105
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:32,119
Rym: But at the same time, no, because that's on average, what you're doing still is you're giving them a shot.

106
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:39,091
Rym: because think about how many people could get to could have gone to RIT if money weren't a factor and made it through that crazy ass school.

107
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:47,689
Rym: And at the same time, how many people got in because they had money and were allowed to stay, but sucked and eventually got kicked out anyway after they lost all their money.

108
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,754
Scott: It's also true.

109
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:50,019
Scott: But the thing is, right?

110
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,546
Rym: Isn't that almost a reverse discrimination?

111
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,454
Rym: You're saying, all right, you have money.

112
00:06:53,474 --> 00:07:00,064
Scott: So we definitely, we definitely need to keep out the people who only have money and don't actually have talents and skills.

113
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:09,320
Rym: We also need to keep out the stupid people, which a lot of the people at RIT, a lot of our classmates were kind of stupid, not good at what they were in.

114
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,620
Scott: So, I mean, basically what's happening though is there are people in the sticks, right?

115
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:22,437
Scott: Who aren't getting in because, you know, and they're basically being discriminated against that way, at least statistically speaking, you know, look at this study.

116
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:30,112
Scott: Yeah, I got to go find these articles, but basically it's like if you're from the state, but could it also be that the people are stupider.

117
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:31,297
Rym: I'm guilty of this too.

118
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,362
Rym: So I'm going to say this straight up.

119
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:38,102
Rym: I have to find the article for you is code for, I am not going to follow up on this.

120
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,014
Rym: I'm going to hope you forget.

121
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:47,100
Scott: And if you raise it again, partially it was cause I read two articles in the same day that said the same thing from different people.

122
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,530
Rym: Oh, I've, I've, I've been in the same situation.

123
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,163
Rym: It's never that like, Oh, I'm losing this argument.

124
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:53,812
Rym: I'm going to make up an article and hope they forget.

125
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,662
Rym: It's always, I do have a source.

126
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:56,606
Rym: I don't remember it.

127
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:58,696
Rym: I don't care enough to go find it.

128
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,745
Scott: I don't really have an opinion on this.

129
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:04,786
Scott: It's just, I'm pointing out that like there's been recently, there's been a lot of talk about this.

130
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,962
Scott: Like, you know, people from the sticks are getting discriminated against.

131
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:13,786
Scott: And basically a lot of these, a couple of the articles were like, they were definitely opinion articles that were raging.

132
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,959
Scott: They were like, uh, evil, blah, discriminated.

133
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:31,000
Rym: What I would guess, what probably is going on independent of all this is that the quote unquote sticks, I mean, I couldn't say that schools are worse or better out there because I mean some of the richer parts of California have some of the worst performing schools in the country.

134
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,889
Rym: So that doesn't work really well, rich kids.

135
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:41,794
Rym: The saddest part is that in the end, socioeconomic status at birth seems to be the primary factor in later success.

136
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:42,578
Scott: Yeah.

137
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,144
Rym: And that's probably the worst.

138
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:49,409
Scott: That's what says, I already discussed that how that's, what's under the bandaid and that is what is not still not fixed.

139
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,678
Scott: We need some, we need to stop.

140
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,658
Scott: And the thing is, I think, you know, okay, we still haven't really figured out how to fix it.

141
00:08:55,678 --> 00:09:00,677
Scott: It's a very difficult problem, but we're putting a whole idea how to fix it.

142
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:03,650
Scott: We're putting a whole lot of effort into fixing.

143
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,544
Scott: Is this your idea of give everyone a pile of money when they're at it?

144
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:08,393
Rym: I like that idea, but no, it's not that idea.

145
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:16,190
Scott: The problem is that we're putting all this effort into bandaid ideas and we're not actually putting the full effort into the act, curing the actual wound itself.

146
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:25,438
Scott: And we should just throw, you know, it's like we should just throw away the bandaid no matter how upset people will be that they have to stare at this gaping wound and concentrate our full effort on the true problem.

147
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:33,167
Rym: Wouldn't that work for the tea party now if we just said, all right, uh, you know, an unnamed state that doesn't want government interference.

148
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:35,314
Rym: Have fun without government subsidies.

149
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:39,046
Scott: I definitely think that there are no roads.

150
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:47,076
Scott: It's definitely my opinion that there is far too much federal subsidizing and I think the first ones that have to go would be say farms.

151
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,883
Rym: I would take the opposite tax.

152
00:09:48,984 --> 00:10:01,067
Rym: government subsidy is fine in my eyes as long as people who use that subsidy understand that it's there and don't argue against government subsidy while simultaneously protecting their own subsidy.

153
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,376
Rym: That is the only part that bothers.

154
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:06,007
Scott: Well, that's how that seems to be how most people operate.

155
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:13,197
Scott: is they just, they don't actually have, you know, they watch TV and they get some idealistic political science viewpoint.

156
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:17,514
Scott: Like, you know, you know, it's better to be, you know, con fiscally conservative.

157
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:20,749
Scott: We should have low taxes and low spend, right?

158
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,130
Scott: And they get that idealistic viewpoint, but they don't actually hold that idealistic viewpoint.

159
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,590
Scott: The only viewpoint they actually hold is better for me and worse for everyone else.

160
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,076
Scott: Whatever's better for me is what's better.

161
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:38,642
Scott: So if I'm getting money from Medicare, Medicare is awesome, but high taxes, high taxes are always bad for me.

162
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,754
Scott: So you want low taxes always because that's better for me.

163
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,250
Scott: Those taxes old man, everyday people just want what's better for them.

164
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,321
Scott: That's what they actually want is better for them.

165
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:56,824
Scott: They don't actually hold the idealistic viewpoint unless they're arguing about something that has nothing to do with them, in which case they'll default to their idealistic, whatever it is.

166
00:10:56,925 --> 00:11:00,467
Scott: I think we should, if it has something to do with them, then they will pick whatever's better for them.

167
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:02,398
Rym: I think we should make this a Thursday show.

168
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:03,303
Scott: The show's already done.

169
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:04,307
Rym: Now we got more.

170
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:06,960
Rym: We could, we could pick, I'll, I'll put forth my plan.

171
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,086
Scott: It was something else we were discussing too, and I completely forgot what it was.

172
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:20,229
Rym: That's a lot of news.

173
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,035
Rym: You said, Oh, there's no news.

174
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,319
Rym: There's nothing to talk about.

175
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,725
Rym: Why even do the front half of the show?

176
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:26,393
Rym: And I got 10 minutes out of you.

177
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:30,632
Scott: Oh, the other thing that I remember the other day or even more, it's still coming.

178
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:32,360
Scott: There was a thing on Boeing Boeing, right?

179
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,596
Rym: And it was talking about how I thought there was nothing on the internet.

180
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:37,584
Scott: I already blog commented on this side.

181
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:50,190
Scott: It's kind of redundant, but anyway, the, um, uh, they were talking about how like the feds in the States are actually doing more raids on bad farms that are doing raw food and raw milk and shit.

182
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,440
Scott: And I was like, I was like, yeah, but the article on Boeing Boeing specifically was talking about like this 12 year old girl.

183
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,091
Scott: And I think the quote was, don't take my computer.

184
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:00,135
Scott: I can't do my homework.

185
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:02,042
Scott: And I'm like, okay, bad.

186
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,931
Scott: Why are they taking some raw milk dude's computer?

187
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:09,407
Rym: Because they can don't, don't get me started seizures.

188
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:17,004
Scott: But on the other hand, of course, half the hippies in the fight or most of the hippies in the fucking comments on Boeing Boeing were like, let the people drink raw milk.

189
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:22,527
Scott: And I'm like, look, dude, I can respect your freedom to drink raw milk if you make your raw milk and you drink it.

190
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:23,230
Scott: But you know what?

191
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,309
Scott: Hey, the law says that the government has the right to regulate commerce.

192
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,042
Rym: law is no law and morals are two separate things.

193
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:38,646
Scott: So, and then on top of that law argument, but completely separate from that law argument, here's my moral argument, right?

194
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:43,203
Scott: Someone might be stupid and they might be, have the right to be stupid.

195
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:48,481
Scott: And that might mean that they have the right to poison themselves with poison milk.

196
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:49,364
Scott: All right.

197
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:54,984
Scott: However, number one, they don't have the right to poison their children with poison milk.

198
00:12:55,044 --> 00:13:01,510
Scott: And number two, even if someone is stupid, so stupid that they want to poison themselves with poison, raw milk, right?

199
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:09,318
Scott: They don't really deserve to die or get listeria or bar freaking E. coli because of that amount of stupidity.

200
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:15,139
Scott: That amount of fecal coliform, that amount of stupidity does not warrant that amount of consequence.

201
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,114
Rym: Therefore, I would never wish gastroenteritis on another human being again.

202
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:22,272
Scott: And gastroenteritis could, you know, just be stomach sickness for a few days.

203
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:23,841
Scott: And I'm still not going to wish it on anyone.

204
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:31,931
Scott: So, I mean, while you have the right to be stupid, do you deserve death for being that stupid enough to drink raw milk?

205
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:41,147
Rym: Well, Scott, we have precedent because if you look at the classic Nintendo game, Shadow Gate, death is, in fact, the consequence of all possible actions, save one.

206
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:50,103
Scott: So if I, right, if I see someone on the side of the street, right, and let's say they're about to drink, you know, I don't know, they're about to smoke a cigarette.

207
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:51,591
Scott: Now, that's pretty stupid, right?

208
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:54,927
Rym: You're going to tackle him, rip it out of their mouth, be like, I saved you.

209
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:55,670
Rym: No, no, no.

210
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,212
Scott: But let's say that, you know, that cigarette actually has like sign at it and they're going to die.

211
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:06,286
Scott: But they don't know that they're stupid, even though it said right on the package, like it's instant death cigarettes who sell some cigarettes.

212
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,600
Scott: They they're not so sure that it's that it's instant death cigarette.

213
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:09,841
Scott: Right.

214
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:11,814
Scott: Even though you told them that, they're like, no, it's not.

215
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:13,564
Scott: It'll only give me cancer when I'm way old.

216
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,032
Scott: They think it's just a little bit unhealthy.

217
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:20,643
Scott: And in fact, they still say that these cigarettes taste way better than any other ones, just like they say the raw milk tastes way better.

218
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:20,884
Scott: Right.

219
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:24,097
Rym: It does taste a little better, I think.

220
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:25,221
Scott: I'm just saying, right.

221
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,207
Rym: Let's say I wouldn't drink it.

222
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:33,863
Scott: If someone is doing something that they think is slightly stupid, but you know, is very stupid and you know that the consequences are very severe and they don't know.

223
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:36,820
Scott: and they don't believe the consequences are as severe as you say.

224
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,665
Scott: And the consequences are basically they're they're killing themselves and they don't think they're killing themselves.

225
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:41,966
Scott: Right.

226
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:48,680
Scott: Like if someone's about to jump off a bridge with a bungee cord and you know, the bungee cord is way unsafe, but they don't believe you.

227
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,467
Scott: They say, no, this bungee cord is totally safe.

228
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:51,291
Scott: Right.

229
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:55,629
Scott: Is physically stopping that person is basically saving them from their own stupidity.

230
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:55,870
Scott: Right.

231
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,794
Scott: You're saving their life.

232
00:14:57,558 --> 00:15:05,721
Scott: So it would be if someone was about to do that bungee jump with the cord that they thought was safe and I knew was not safe and I stopped them from doing that, would that not be totally cool?

233
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:06,545
Rym: Probably.

234
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:09,357
Scott: I'm saving someone's life from their own stupidity.

235
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:18,974
Scott: So if somebody is drinking poison milk or whatever, other nasty poison bathtub cheese or whatever the hell raw food they got, they got from the dirty farmer.

236
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:19,576
Scott: Right.

237
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:22,589
Scott: Who didn't want to, you know, follow the government's rules about clean food.

238
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:26,508
Scott: And I stopped them or the government stops them from eating that food.

239
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,180
Scott: That's the same as saving that bungee jumpers life.

240
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,946
Scott: And it should totally be okay.

241
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:46,847
Scott: You know, unless you want to argue that the, you know, I mean, if you want to argue that there's a right to suicide and that's an argument, a separate argument because this is someone committing suicide who doesn't know, they think they're only hurting themselves a little bit, but they're going to get really hurt and they don't know it just because they're dumb.

242
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,401
Rym: Scott, I get like three and a half more minutes out of you.

243
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:51,710
Scott: That's not, it wasn't any newses.

244
00:15:51,991 --> 00:16:03,858
Rym: My only news was Scott is blab about everything, but then if you actually get him to, you said something, you said something else that instigated this reminded me self motivated that I did in fact come before you.

245
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:05,924
Scott: I'm just not self reminded.

246
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:09,316
Rym: You're not an actor, but you're simply a receiver.

247
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,547
Scott: Oh, I was reminded of something to talk about.

248
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,179
Rym: So you're, you're catching as opposed to pitching.

249
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,108
Scott: You want to see what's on my pitch in the ideas.

250
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:15,993
Rym: You're just catching him.

251
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:17,259
Scott: I got stuff to say.

252
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,430
Scott: I just don't remember what it was and it wasn't news.

253
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:28,163
Rym: Now I don't even have to talk about the, the city of old people that is in an uproar in Florida about the fact that the school's being built in their community.

254
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:31,732
Rym: I don't even have to talk about that now.

255
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:32,595
Scott: Oh my gosh.

256
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:35,304
Rym: There's funny things to say.

257
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:39,686
Rym: Probably the FARC headline was like, town wants everybody to get off their collective lawns.

258
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:40,510
Scott: There you go.

259
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:42,118
Rym: But uh, I don't have to say anything.

260
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,453
Scott: We had a good, do we really need to say anything about that?

261
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:46,438
Rym: I don't think we do.

262
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:47,621
Rym: I'll link to the article anyway.

263
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:48,442
Rym: It's pretty great.

264
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:50,925
Scott: It speaks to itself.

265
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:02,585
Rym: So anyway, things of the day, I don't know how this guy survived.

266
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:07,061
Rym: Uh, nevermind the guy in front of him hanging out in all the lightning.

267
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:08,730
Scott: Is this a, is it like an own video?

268
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:09,554
Rym: No, just a picture.

269
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:10,317
Rym: Okay.

270
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:16,038
Rym: It's a picture I took at the Olympic stadium in Athens during a severe thunderstorm over a half hour.

271
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,770
Scott: He caught quote, wait, which Olympic stadium?

272
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,277
Scott: The recent one or the ancient one?

273
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:21,201
Rym: The reason one.

274
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:21,482
Rym: Okay.

275
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:24,010
Rym: Caught quote 51 one's still there.

276
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,497
Rym: The Olympic stadium.

277
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,457
Scott: No, you know that they used in the original Olympics, the original Olympics wings on their feet.

278
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,242
Rym: When were the original Olympics like?

279
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:34,585
Scott: over a century ago?

280
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:41,439
Rym: Uh, anyway, so he captured 51 quote unquote.

281
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,682
Scott: Oh my God.

282
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:44,167
Scott: A century ago was 1910.

283
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,974
Scott: It must've been like multiple centuries ago.

284
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:57,620
Rym: So basically what he did is he had the camera set up and he just took a pictures of a whole bunch of lightning and superimposed all of them together into one picture of this giant lightning display.

285
00:17:58,681 --> 00:17:59,703
Rym: And it's kind of awesome.

286
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:05,619
Scott: Ancient Olympics, seven hundred and seventy six BC.

287
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,003
Scott: I was right many centuries ago.

288
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:07,967
Rym: Yes, many.

289
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:08,850
Scott: Yeah.

290
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:09,412
Scott: All right.

291
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:10,114
Rym: Okay.

292
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:10,917
Rym: So what do you got for me?

293
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:15,230
Scott: Oh, so you know the one geekery that I do not like is Star Trek.

294
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,585
Scott: However, the one geekery, I don't know what other geekeries don't I like?

295
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:21,595
Rym: But kind of cannot all things be geekeries.

296
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,854
Rym: I mean you're not really into personal general mutilation geekery.

297
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,557
Scott: Okay.

298
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:27,360
Scott: But I mean the one.

299
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,043
Scott: there's two, at least two, I mean the one thing that is like, you know, stereotypical stereotypical geek.

300
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:33,424
Scott: Yeah.

301
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:34,930
Scott: I mean it's a sci fi thing.

302
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,914
Scott: It's ultra pot anyway.

303
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:44,247
Scott: But, uh, I do know at least this much that there was an episode of Star Trek about some like some fuzzy creatures, troubles.

304
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:44,589
Scott: Yeah.

305
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:47,726
Scott: And they basically get all over the place and then they get rid of them somehow.

306
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:48,611
Scott: I'd ever saw it.

307
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,421
Scott: I just know that there's an episode about right.

308
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:51,926
Rym: They breed like mad.

309
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:52,990
Rym: They breed like Kirk.

310
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:53,532
Scott: Yeah.

311
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:53,953
Scott: Anyway.

312
00:18:53,973 --> 00:19:02,342
Scott: Uh, and I also know that I am excellent at recognizing quality graphic design, although I could not make it for the life of me.

313
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:11,333
Scott: And apparently at the Alamo draft house, some guy made them some new posters to hang up and they are trouble with tribbles posters.

314
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,160
Scott: And the graphic design is like unbelievably.

315
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:14,204
Rym: Oh my God.

316
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:17,556
Rym: That is the same style as that awesome X-Men poster.

317
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:18,199
Scott: There's two.

318
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,143
Scott: There's another one.

319
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,272
Scott: There's a red one and a blue one.

320
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,260
Rym: I kind of want that blue one on my wall.

321
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:23,821
Scott: Yeah.

322
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:26,334
Scott: They're, they're like the highest, highest quality.

323
00:19:26,354 --> 00:19:29,790
Scott: And I think it's like a limited edition print something, something you might not even be able to get it now.

324
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,292
Scott: Who knows?

325
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:37,834
Scott: Uh, but yeah, 18 by 24 inch go on sale Friday on the Mondo website.

326
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:42,467
Scott: There's going to be 350 blue ones and 190 red ones.

327
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:42,547
Scott: Huh?

328
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,755
Scott: So I hope you have your monies.

329
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:46,140
Rym: I have plenty of money.

330
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,661
Scott: Yeah.

331
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:49,091
Scott: But the graphic design is a excellent day.

332
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:58,099
Scott: I can tell even though by the pixels, even though I don't care about the subject matter and that's probably the only reason the only thing that's preventing you from buying this is the subject matter.

333
00:19:58,139 --> 00:19:59,462
Scott: I mean, remember that X-Men.

334
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:01,528
Scott: is it the same?

335
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,594
Rym: That's what I just said.

336
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:05,138
Rym: Oh, I said that.

337
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:06,403
Rym: Do you not even listen?

338
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:07,871
Rym: No, you're right next to him.

339
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:09,218
Rym: You were four feet away from me.

340
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:11,830
Scott: I was busy looking at the excellent graphic design.

341
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:16,271
Rym: So very briefly, the meta moment, the book club was obviously the lives of Locke Lamora.

342
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:17,337
Scott: What's the next book club?

343
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:17,779
Scott: I don't know.

344
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,402
Scott: I don't know either.

345
00:20:18,603 --> 00:20:19,326
Rym: We're working on that.

346
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,575
Rym: Uh, next weekend is Otakon.

347
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:23,002
Rym: We will not be there.

348
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:24,028
Rym: They don't have a schedule yet.

349
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:28,377
Rym: So we even need to say that we're not going to because other people, you know, a lot of people expected us to be there.

350
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:29,282
Rym: I've gotten some emails.

351
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:29,866
Scott: Oh, okay.

352
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:34,370
Scott: Oh, but you know, you should go to Otakon if you're a close by or if you have, you know, we'll probably have fun.

353
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:43,835
Scott: I mean, not the same amount of fun as if you had, if we weren't there, it's not going to be different perspective of a con goer, unless the only reason you like going to Otakon is to see us.

354
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,103
Scott: In which case, what the hell's wrong with you?

355
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:49,187
Rym: Probably made a lot of fans happy because, you know, we decided not to do the two panels they'd confirm.

356
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:50,956
Rym: So they got two more Italian panels.

357
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:51,519
Rym: I'm assuming.

358
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,719
Rym: But all that aside, we got the penny arcade expo coming up at the end of summer.

359
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:57,221
Rym: We'll be there.

360
00:20:57,241 --> 00:21:00,107
Rym: New York Comic Con anime festival, 10, 10, 10, all that other stuff.

361
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:06,623
Rym: I don't have any feedback.

362
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:07,991
Rym: We've gotten the book club a little bit.

363
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:14,065
Scott: So while we keep changing it, the thing is, right, is I'm basically, I'm going to, I'm going to tell a secret that I have kept, right?

364
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:14,527
Scott: Is?

365
00:21:14,547 --> 00:21:18,105
Scott: I've sort of had this attitude where I'm like, no one reads the books, blah, blah, blah.

366
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,617
Scott: We got to make the punk kids read blah, blah, blah.

367
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:20,878
Scott: Right.

368
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:24,295
Scott: The thing is I have absolutely no idea how many people actually read or not.

369
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:25,280
Scott: I have not counted.

370
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,385
Scott: I have not done a survey.

371
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:26,967
Scott: I don't even know.

372
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:28,032
Rym: I'll say this.

373
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:39,140
Scott: Basically assuming that no one reads, because if I make that assumption then and take this attitude, then I hope that that is the attitude, uh, that will force us to keep trying to get more people to read.

374
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,132
Rym: So self deception is a valid means to success.

375
00:21:42,152 --> 00:21:43,357
Scott: I'm not deceiving myself.

376
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:44,623
Rym: So you're lying to other people.

377
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:47,055
Rym: Uh, no, you're saying kids don't read it.

378
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:47,477
Rym: You don't know.

379
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:48,662
Scott: the kids definitely don't read.

380
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,369
Rym: What are you basing that on?

381
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:51,815
Scott: I know they don't read.

382
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:52,920
Rym: What did you just say?

383
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,225
Scott: His kids tell me they don't read.

384
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:55,632
Rym: I take a very different tack.

385
00:21:56,235 --> 00:22:02,403
Rym: I've been saying no one's going to read the books because I'm hoping that what will happen is people will feel indignant.

386
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,392
Rym: Like he's going to say, I'm not, I'm going to read the book.

387
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:04,714
Rym: Yeah.

388
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:05,437
Rym: Yeah.

389
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:06,562
Scott: That's that's the idea.

390
00:22:06,602 --> 00:22:07,264
Rym: That's my plan.

391
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:11,579
Rym: But again, deception, valid strategy of success.

392
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,444
Scott: It's not deception.

393
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,450
Scott: That's just insulting.

394
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,054
Scott: It's like, Hey you, you punk kid, you're not going to read this, but I know we will read it because I said he won't.

395
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:18,416
Scott: Yeah.

396
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:21,612
Scott: Well let's, we're going to figure out how many people actually read regardless.

397
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:24,767
Scott: So we are going to make some changes to hopefully the biggest change.

398
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:27,922
Rym: And I don't know why we didn't even see this and I thought about it a lot.

399
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:30,133
Scott: I'm going to tell you what the problem with the idea.

400
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:36,302
Rym: So basically before we, we shouldn't treat the book club reviews the same way as you treat a real review, like anything else.

401
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:40,724
Rym: we talk about where we do the review, which is, this is why it's awesome with no spoilers.

402
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:43,077
Rym: So you know, to read it and you know, it's awesome.

403
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:44,303
Rym: You're like, alright, I'm going to do it.

404
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:49,225
Rym: And then we do the final thoughts, the spoilers, the, all right, so we know you've read it.

405
00:22:49,526 --> 00:22:52,403
Rym: Wasn't it fucking awesome when the guy killed the guy in the second chapter.

406
00:22:52,444 --> 00:23:02,210
Scott: The problem is that if we still did Thursday episodes every Thursday, that would work, but we'd have to basically give two Thursday episodes per book and we only do two Thursday episodes per month if that.

407
00:23:02,592 --> 00:23:11,610
Scott: So either we would do a book a month and Thursday would become book club night or we did a book every two months in which case every other Thursday episode would be book club.

408
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:18,506
Scott: or if we did it every four months and then we're doing a book every four months, it's only three books a year and they still can't finish reading them.

409
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:20,157
Rym: So that's about a good, it's a good amount of time.

410
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:24,300
Scott: So, you know, we're not going to be, it's like, uh, I don't know why you want to do more often.

411
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,109
Scott: Well, I mean, I, you know, it feels like either Thursday is going to become book night or I don't know, or we don't do them that often.

412
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:37,219
Scott: Maybe we should make it a completely separate episode and give Thursday back to Thursday and make book club its own episode.

413
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:39,833
Rym: You're the one always complaining that we don't have any Thursdays to do.

414
00:23:40,054 --> 00:23:40,356
Scott: I know.

415
00:23:40,376 --> 00:23:42,767
Rym: I think this is my strategy for Thursday episodes.

416
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:47,851
Rym: now is going to be to just force a topic and we'll just do it because all I have to do is get you talking.

417
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:53,799
Scott: Maybe if we do, maybe we do two book club episodes per month or one, you know, one book club episode per month.

418
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:55,427
Rym: You think they're going to read these books in a month?

419
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,883
Scott: And no, no, we do one book club episode per month, which would be two, you know, if we do two episodes per book, that would be six books a year.

420
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:03,585
Scott: Right.

421
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:06,919
Scott: But then that, that book club episode is not a Thursday episode.

422
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,046
Scott: It's its own episode.

423
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:10,299
Scott: It has nothing to do with Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

424
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:18,764
Rym: Well, even if it's his own episode, we can put it up in Thursdays, but we can skip all that meta, but we would still do two other non book Thursdays every month that I expected to do that anyway.

425
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:19,589
Scott: All right, so let's do that.

426
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:26,364
Rym: So regardless, the lives of Loch Lamer, the way we're going to do this little change up, we're going to review it and talk about it straight up.

427
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:30,003
Rym: And we're not going to spoil anything and we're going to warn you when spoilers come.

428
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:39,748
Rym: So if you have not read the book yet, this is our chance to convince you to read the book and you can come back and listen to, you know, everything past those spoiler line where you find out how lock dies is

429
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:56,505
Scott: just, you know, doing the, tell you something that may or may not be true as that you are, you know, that's the greatest when you can spoil someone, but keep the uncertainty so that they, you know, even though they'll be thinking about that thing, they won't know if it's actually going to happen or not because now they're uncertain.

430
00:24:56,525 --> 00:24:58,175
Rym: Evangelion is the best example of that.

431
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:03,525
Rym: You just go to someone who's never seen it, doesn't really know what it's about and say, yeah, that Ava show, it's great, but everyone dies in the end.

432
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:06,033
Rym: Everyone, every single character dies.

433
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:08,881
Rym: They won't believe you.

434
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,928
Scott: Well, you know, cause it's not directed by Tamino.

435
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:14,353
Scott: So no, no.

436
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:22,209
Scott: Anyway, so Loch Lamer straight up, having read this book, I don't know how to pronounce Lamora and we don't have a guide that I'm going to check the internet.

437
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,226
Rym: Maybe I can find between Lamora and Lamora, depending on how I'm feeling.

438
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:31,012
Scott: I like, you know, I don't know which is correct, but saying Lamora is it, you know, it feels better on the mouth.

439
00:25:31,052 --> 00:25:31,815
Scott: Sing Lamora.

440
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:35,490
Rym: It is very, because you say the whole title, it's very like.

441
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,233
Rym: the rhythm is nice.

442
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:37,639
Rym: The lies of lock Lamora.

443
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,523
Scott: I don't know.

444
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:39,546
Rym: I think a lot.

445
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:43,300
Scott: I think the lies of lock Lamora is, is, but it's not as poetic.

446
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,883
Rym: I don't have the rhythm that, you know, like, like the Assyrians came down like the Wolf on the fold.

447
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:48,828
Rym: Their cohorts were gleaming.

448
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:51,260
Scott: It feels better in the mouth to say Lamora.

449
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,886
Rym: You're a terrible poet then.

450
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:56,663
Scott: Well, apparently he's already got titles for the seven books in the series.

451
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,045
Rym: Oh yeah.

452
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:58,009
Rym: He's planned everything.

453
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:05,340
Rym: He DC, all the tricks and all the like little references he put near the end of this book that clearly he is going to answer later.

454
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:08,368
Rym: Like the fact that locks real name has five syllables.

455
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:13,824
Rym: He clearly like he has this whole thing planned out.

456
00:26:13,885 --> 00:26:17,668
Rym: now that this book has been mildly successful and the book was pretty successful as far as I can tell.

457
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:27,164
Scott: Well, judging by the front of the book, which I already discussed when he introduced it, that there's a zillion like pull quotes is is not the most well written book.

458
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:29,836
Scott: The style, it didn't win the Pulitzer prize guys.

459
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:33,512
Rym: The style of like the, it is notable for the story it tells.

460
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:36,545
Rym: It is not notable for the way in which the story was told.

461
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:39,940
Scott: Well, I mean there are, you know, I mean the writing is not bad writing.

462
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,046
Scott: You can tell what's going on.

463
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:44,183
Scott: when there's an action scene, you can follow the action really well.

464
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:48,021
Rym: It's not completely on notable, like there's nothing special about the way it's written.

465
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:53,582
Scott: No, I mean there are the descriptions of the world, you know, are very full and rich.

466
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:55,957
Scott: It is like he would be able to make a really good campaign setting.

467
00:26:55,998 --> 00:26:59,271
Scott: He's like, ah, yes, there is a, there are five castles here.

468
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:00,717
Scott: They are made of this material.

469
00:27:00,737 --> 00:27:04,694
Scott: This one is the tallest one and you know, and this one is shorter.

470
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:08,385
Rym: They're full and rich, but they're asides always.

471
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:08,766
Scott: Yup.

472
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:17,809
Rym: And whenever they come, they come in this way that it's really hard to explain this, but they reek of a game book.

473
00:27:19,392 --> 00:27:20,415
Rym: So hard.

474
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:21,878
Scott: 10 times hard.

475
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:27,476
Rym: Like they have that kind of nod to your people living in the modern world.

476
00:27:27,717 --> 00:27:37,694
Rym: Like he'll describe a sport and he's so obviously like wanting you to compare it to football and compare the things they've got set up to like the real modern world.

477
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:41,029
Scott: Describes the rule of the sport, but the sport doesn't actually matter really.

478
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,114
Rym: That's fine.

479
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:50,367
Rym: The problem is the way he describes these things has the same wink and a nod that in a D and D campaign you describe like, you know, some traveler comes from some portal.

480
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:53,178
Rym: He's got this stick and it's metal.

481
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:54,684
Rym: It's like four feet long.

482
00:27:54,744 --> 00:28:00,429
Rym: And on the end of it, there's these holes and it made some thunder earlier and the DMS look at you the whole time.

483
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:01,816
Rym: Like, you know, it's a gun.

484
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,282
Rym: I'm not going to call it a gun.

485
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:06,133
Rym: Characters don't know, but you know, it's a gun.

486
00:28:06,173 --> 00:28:06,935
Rym: Isn't that cool?

487
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:07,899
Scott: Yeah.

488
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,687
Rym: I mean, these books do that all the time.

489
00:28:09,747 --> 00:28:13,486
Scott: The thing is right is on the one hand it's doing the cowboy bebop thing, right?

490
00:28:13,506 --> 00:28:20,157
Scott: Where you have a story and you have a world and the world is obviously this crazy world that has a ton of crazy shit going on, right?

491
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:22,087
Scott: It's like they have these castles and all this stuff.

492
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:23,213
Scott: What's the crystal?

493
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:24,118
Scott: It's what's it called?

494
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,365
Rym: Elder glass, elder glass.

495
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:31,692
Scott: All this shit is made of elder glass because there was some civilization that lived here before the current civilization disclosure.

496
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:35,429
Rym: Anything that includes precursor civilizations gets my rocket go.

497
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:44,174
Scott: So there was a, there was a precursor civilization with crazy advanced magic technology that is now gone and there are people now living in the elder glass that they don't know how to make or any, right?

498
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:45,340
Scott: Which is totally cool.

499
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,446
Scott: It's a cowboy bebop, right?

500
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:53,563
Scott: There's these gates and there's something going on with the gates and, but really our story of our characters that we're focusing on has nothing to do with that.

501
00:28:53,603 --> 00:29:02,084
Scott: They're just in this world and we're going to flesh out during the show you that this world is totally bigger and awesomer than these characters to make a really good setting, right?

502
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:03,048
Scott: And that's always cool.

503
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:11,359
Scott: The difference between Locke Lamora and cowboy bebop is that coming bebop doesn't really dive into the details of the world.

504
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:12,986
Scott: They just sort of show you the world.

505
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:20,899
Scott: It's like there's gates, their characters use them, you know, and they hint like there's, there's obviously a big story about these gates.

506
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:22,186
Scott: We're not going to tell you anything about them.

507
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:28,862
Rym: And they tell oblique stories to those like early on there's the kid who was immortal in cowboy bebop and that is like oblique to the gates.

508
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:34,528
Rym: Like that story comes out of the gates, intersects with our plot that we're following, and then kind of falls away.

509
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,251
Rym: Yeah.

510
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:36,477
Rym: Locke Lamora, right?

511
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:45,132
Scott: They basically go in depth and tell you all these crazy details about things that, you know, are like they actually fill out those things in the world.

512
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:48,368
Scott: They don't just like wink at you like, Hey, there's a sport called something.

513
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,163
Scott: They're actually like, here's the, all the rules of the sport.

514
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:53,336
Scott: We're going to tell you every single rule of the sport that there is.

515
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:58,165
Scott: And we're going to tell you the history of the sport and everything just like they would in the forgotten realms.

516
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:01,358
Scott: But then there are other things they don't tell you, right?

517
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:09,862
Scott: It's like they don't give you, you know, usually a book, they tend to either have the omniscient view, you know, everything or the one character view, you know what this character knows, right?

518
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:10,767
Scott: Or something like that.

519
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:14,444
Scott: This book, it's like, he tells you whatever it's convenient for you to know.

520
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:22,243
Scott: It's like, if he doesn't want you to know that because you know, it'll be a cool, suspenseful mystery, then he'll hide it from you and then tell it to you at the right time.

521
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:25,560
Scott: If he wants to save it for a sequel, he'll give you a character's name.

522
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:26,504
Scott: Like what's that girl?

523
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:27,689
Scott: Savitha, right?

524
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,091
Rym: Yeah.

525
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:34,200
Scott: He'll tell you that this girl exists and won't tell you anything about her, you know, just because he wants to drag it for the sequel.

526
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,251
Scott: And there'll be, you know, something else.

527
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:41,752
Scott: It's like, he'll want you to know part of it, but he'll want, you know, everything because it's a surprise.

528
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:45,813
Scott: It's like, come on guys, tell me, you know, you got to be consistent here.

529
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:50,335
Scott: Don't tell me just what it's convenient to tell me, you know, you gotta, you gotta have some pattern to it.

530
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:58,816
Rym: Well, I guess it's just, this is why this is a fun book, but not a great book because every time he tells you about the world, it's always kind of a shoehorn in his side.

531
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,546
Rym: It's always just kind of like, it's often cool.

532
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:01,432
Scott: Like it's awesome.

533
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:05,992
Scott: Like that sport is actually a pretty good sport, but it just has nothing to do with the story.

534
00:31:06,052 --> 00:31:10,811
Rym: So it's a book where the events and the story itself are the most interesting part.

535
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:18,960
Rym: It's in my eyes, the perfect kind of book to turn into a movie like the prince of nothing, a completely shallow action movie.

536
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,924
Rym: Not necessarily.

537
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:21,269
Rym: It's not that shallow.

538
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:32,171
Rym: It's just that the writing, the style of the writing and the style of the literature and the act of reading it does not impart that much value compared to just the interest in the story.

539
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:33,858
Rym: I wanted to know what happened next.

540
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,632
Rym: I didn't linger on the meaning of a word at the end of a sentence.

541
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:37,336
Scott: Yeah.

542
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:40,853
Scott: The other problem though is that really there are three stories going on, right?

543
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,942
Scott: You've got the story of the past, right?

544
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:49,244
Scott: You've got the story of the con because obviously the con is just context for the current situation.

545
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:49,546
Rym: Right.

546
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:53,503
Scott: And then you've got the story of, you know, the stranger comes to town, right?

547
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:54,889
Scott: So you've got the three stories.

548
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:57,359
Scott: And the thing is the story of the con.

549
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,745
Scott: I like that a lot more.

550
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:02,140
Scott: The stranger that came to town really felt like he came out of nowhere.

551
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:10,613
Rym: And even though they, they gave you a connection, that connection was the same connection as like every, like, Oh, here's all the stuff about Wraith stone.

552
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:11,637
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

553
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:14,225
Scott: The connection of the bad guy, right?

554
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:17,695
Scott: To lock Lamora was so such a weak connection.

555
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:22,435
Scott: It's like, you know, why, why did like Lamora really care about this guy?

556
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:24,947
Rym: No, I think kind of the point not to say it's not like a connection.

557
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:26,656
Scott: Like Darth Vader is Luke's father.

558
00:32:26,676 --> 00:32:27,480
Scott: There's a connection.

559
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,653
Rym: We can't spoil, but that's actually, that was a really interesting twist that we'll talk about after the spoiler line as to why that was the case.

560
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:33,338
Rym: All right.

561
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:34,927
Rym: Cause I thought that was actually pretty well done.

562
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:42,379
Rym: It's something that it's one of the few things that a book like the way this book ends and like what happens in it is not expected.

563
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,082
Rym: Like you'll read this book.

564
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:44,228
Rym: You're like, I know where this is going.

565
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:47,242
Scott: I didn't expect it'll, it'll lie.

566
00:32:47,262 --> 00:32:48,285
Scott: I will not lie.

567
00:32:48,305 --> 00:33:00,955
Rym: I was looped, but it, because of stuff like that and not because it's shallow, cause it's not that shallow, but just because the events themselves standalone and are interesting, this would make a great fricking movie.

568
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:05,814
Scott: I would see this in the theater, but it wouldn't be like a, uh, you know, a deep movie.

569
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:10,527
Scott: It would be, you know, you'd go for the action and the surprise and the story.

570
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,031
Rym: And the story is good.

571
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:17,606
Scott: The story is, but the doesn't have a message for you.

572
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:18,350
Rym: Yeah, it does.

573
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,360
Rym: The messages don't fuck with Locke Lamora.

574
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:20,861
Scott: Yeah.

575
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:27,854
Scott: But I mean, it doesn't have a message about, you know, like some, you know, I mean, uh, you know, like the, uh, well, I'll put it this way.

576
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:30,127
Scott: Lord of the flies is something to say about society.

577
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:32,179
Scott: This doesn't have anything to say about the prince of nothing.

578
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:44,377
Rym: Those books, the events, this is why, like I hold them to a higher standard or like a Michael Shayvon book where his writing is so lyrical and just beautiful, but with the Prince of nothing, the events are interesting and I really want to know what happened next.

579
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:53,095
Rym: But the style of the writing and the way the world is introduced to you is also so masterful that that is like this completely separate enjoyment.

580
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:59,977
Scott: The Prince of nothing has something to say about the nature of free will and knowledge and such.

581
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:00,919
Rym: That's the third factor.

582
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:02,285
Rym: And that is three aspects.

583
00:34:02,365 --> 00:34:05,399
Scott: And that is so Locke Lamora only has like one and a half aspects.

584
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:07,048
Rym: Locke Lamora has one and a half aspects.

585
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,415
Rym: Prince of nothing has three.

586
00:34:08,574 --> 00:34:09,158
Scott: That's right.

587
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:09,982
Rym: Shayvon has four.

588
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:11,649
Rym: It's that plus a Pulitzer.

589
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:16,310
Scott: It's short on aspects basically, but the aspects he has, he's got them right.

590
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:18,080
Scott: I mean, if I wrote a book, I would have like half aspects.

591
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,668
Rym: This is also the book.

592
00:34:19,748 --> 00:34:22,360
Rym: If you want source material, cause not a lot of people will have read this.

593
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:27,563
Rym: If you're going to run like a fantasy D and D campaign, just steal this setting straight up.

594
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:38,340
Scott: Oh, the thing is, I don't know how well it worked for D and D specifically because it's not so much of a medieval, it's more of a renaissance kind of setting.

595
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,284
Rym: Yeah, so set it in Waterdeep.

596
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:41,197
Rym: Waterdeep is a very renaissance kind of city.

597
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:41,719
Rym: That kind of thing.

598
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,021
Scott: Oh, is it?

599
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:42,322
Scott: Okay.

600
00:34:42,443 --> 00:34:42,724
Scott: Yeah.

601
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:43,266
Scott: Yeah.

602
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:47,650
Rym: I mean, it's, I think it's definitely, you know, push more toward the steampunk and the technology.

603
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:52,052
Scott: I mean, you can tell with all the boats going on is definitely supposed to be a Venice situation, right?

604
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:59,369
Scott: It's so obvious, you know, with all they, they basically take a boat anywhere they go almost, you know, and every, like the big festival is like on the water.

605
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:02,869
Scott: It does seem though that like, you know, Venice is like lots of little waterways, right?

606
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:03,633
Scott: In between everything.

607
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,383
Scott: This seems like this big waterways.

608
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:09,848
Scott: Like if you just replaced all the really big roads with water, but it kept all the regular roads as roads.

609
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,196
Scott: That's what it seems like.

610
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:18,250
Rym: Well, that's, that was one of the things that was weird, despite how accurately, like how, how much you would explain, like, this is this district, this is that district.

611
00:35:18,592 --> 00:35:20,943
Rym: I never had a clear map in my head of where anything was.

612
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:22,229
Scott: Did you look at the map in the book?

613
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,571
Rym: No.

614
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:23,897
Scott: There's a map in the book.

615
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:26,128
Rym: But like from the writing, you don't get that.

616
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:27,757
Scott: No, you need to look at the map.

617
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:30,311
Rym: You just don't have the sense of where things are.

618
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:35,960
Scott: Without that map, you are basically gonna have no idea, but the map basically gives you everything you need to know because it's all labeled.

619
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:36,622
Rym: Yeah.

620
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:44,987
Rym: But along those lines, the book also kind of, it'll, characters take abuse that is infeasible and survive.

621
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:45,991
Scott: Yeah.

622
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,079
Scott: I mean, the book is not a realistic book.

623
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:50,026
Scott: There's fucking crazy magic and shit in it.

624
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:51,371
Scott: You know, I mean, come on.

625
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:59,203
Rym: It was kind of elegant how he, how Scott Lynch was able to have magic and yet set it up such that it's not just the panacea for everybody.

626
00:35:59,585 --> 00:35:59,906
Scott: Yeah.

627
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:01,574
Rym: It's always the panacea for the boss.

628
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:05,050
Scott: That's always the trouble when you bring magic into a, into any book.

629
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:05,291
Scott: Right.

630
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:07,682
Scott: I mean, you know, it's like, okay, so this is magic.

631
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:11,662
Scott: You have to make the, if you want to just let everyone have magic, then it's just crazy.

632
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:12,465
Scott: Right.

633
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:15,115
Scott: And no one has any problems cause they can solve them with magic.

634
00:36:15,577 --> 00:36:17,605
Rym: So magic gimped and then it sucks.

635
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:18,629
Rym: Prince of nothing did it.

636
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:18,890
Rym: well.

637
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:22,568
Rym: Magic is nuclear fucking power, but only a few people have it.

638
00:36:22,588 --> 00:36:23,916
Scott: You can make magic hurt people.

639
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:28,600
Scott: You can make magic hard to get, but the thing is you have to do it in such a way that doesn't insult the reader.

640
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,206
Scott: It's like, yeah, we're going to make it.

641
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:34,344
Scott: So the only way you can get magic is this magic powder.

642
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:36,172
Scott: You need this magic powder to get.

643
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:37,318
Scott: It's like, okay, come on guys.

644
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:37,720
Scott: Really?

645
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,965
Scott: That's kind of weak sauce.

646
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:44,831
Scott: But here, the way they limit the magic is actually a clever and new way that I have not seen in a fantasy setting before.

647
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:46,036
Scott: So that is good.

648
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:52,569
Rym: So I think the best way to sell this to you if you're an anime fan and if you're not, you should watch Lupin the third, the castle of Cagliostro.

649
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,355
Scott: It's similar to Lupin, right?

650
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,403
Rym: The way locks character is.

651
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,550
Rym: imagine Lupin if he had a backstory.

652
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,332
Rym: that was legit.

653
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:00,195
Scott: All right.

654
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:02,704
Rym: He's beat acts the same way as Lupin.

655
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:05,714
Rym: He's ruthless and protects his friends above all else.

656
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:09,011
Rym: He'd steals and he doesn't give a shit about the stuff he stole.

657
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:10,721
Rym: He steals because stealing is the whole point.

658
00:37:11,343 --> 00:37:11,603
Scott: Yup.

659
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,772
Rym: And he likes to mess with people.

660
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:15,374
Scott: Yup.

661
00:37:15,915 --> 00:37:21,058
Rym: He's also, he has weird love triangle problems and the girl he likes is never there and other girls like him.

662
00:37:21,078 --> 00:37:21,862
Rym: He doesn't like them.

663
00:37:22,524 --> 00:37:30,913
Rym: The only problem though, he has his gang and every one of them is like, he has his Jigen only instead of a gun, he has two fricking axes.

664
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,487
Scott: The only difference between Lupin and Locke Lammer, right?

665
00:37:34,507 --> 00:37:37,220
Scott: Is that Lupin is pretty much bad-ass all around, right?

666
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:47,380
Scott: I mean, he's got some friends like, you know, Goemon is much better at fighting than Lupin and you know, um, Jigen is much better at shooting, but Lupin ain't bad at shooting.

667
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,287
Scott: You know, Lupin ain't bad at fighting.

668
00:37:52,072 --> 00:37:53,555
Scott: Locke is bad at fighting.

669
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:55,119
Scott: Basically anything fighting.

670
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,907
Scott: He gets the shit beat out of him.

671
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,395
Scott: He can't fight for shit.

672
00:37:58,435 --> 00:37:59,200
Scott: So look at who he fights.

673
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:08,682
Rym: The one guy that we really see him fight out of, outside of his backstory, it's basically a Kenshiro situation, but there's no Kenshiro and you're fighting one of the Kenshiro bad guys.

674
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:13,120
Scott: No, they're, they're, they're fights that he basically Locke is not good at everything.

675
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,988
Scott: He's always basically put all his min max.

676
00:38:15,048 --> 00:38:18,442
Scott: He's got all his points into being a con artist and such.

677
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:25,844
Scott: Whereas the Lupin has a lot of points in stealing and is across the board, he's got average points.

678
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,552
Scott: Locke Lammer is min max.

679
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:28,335
Scott: He's got some min's.

680
00:38:28,395 --> 00:38:29,279
Scott: Lupin has no min's.

681
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,585
Rym: But forget all that.

682
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:34,063
Rym: The story and the way the character is and the way he interacts with everything.

683
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:37,659
Rym: This is the story of pretty much what Lupin would do in a world like this.

684
00:38:38,262 --> 00:38:38,463
Scott: Yeah.

685
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,928
Scott: I mean, it's just, it's just fun.

686
00:38:39,948 --> 00:38:43,842
Scott: You know, it's like, Hey, let's have a fun stealing old time.

687
00:38:43,882 --> 00:38:44,444
Scott: Woo.

688
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:45,347
Scott: And then you do.

689
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:48,717
Rym: So I think at this point, let's, let's spoil stuff.

690
00:38:49,098 --> 00:38:49,680
Rym: Spoilers.

691
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,455
Scott: So if you haven't, if you haven't read it, uh, don't listen or listen.

692
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:57,619
Scott: I mean, you know, I mean, even with the spoilers, I guess the book could still be entertaining.

693
00:38:57,659 --> 00:38:57,961
Scott: I don't know.

694
00:38:58,262 --> 00:38:58,464
Rym: Yeah.

695
00:38:58,524 --> 00:39:07,082
Rym: So I guess before we spoil anything else, the one thing I really want to talk about is Wraithstone because one elegant thing he did is he talks about gentle animals early on.

696
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:10,760
Rym: Like there was a gentle goat and whatever, and I was creepy ass eyes looking at you.

697
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:14,652
Rym: And I just assumed that gentlemen gelded basically.

698
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:15,295
Scott: No.

699
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:16,078
Scott: Then he explains it.

700
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:16,338
Rym: Yes.

701
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:18,047
Rym: But that was way later in the beginning.

702
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:18,731
Rym: He didn't explain it.

703
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:19,536
Rym: It's like blah, blah, blah.

704
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:19,978
Rym: Gentled.

705
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,013
Rym: And I just, I read right past that and I thought, yeah, gelded.

706
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:23,677
Rym: All right, whatever.

707
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,109
Rym: He's, I don't know why he, I think that was intentional.

708
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:26,511
Rym: Yes.

709
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:33,700
Rym: That's why I'm saying it was one elegantly like put together part when he actually explains what he means by gentle and the whole thing.

710
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:41,480
Rym: Basically the elder glass asbestos, the Wraithstones like, yeah, if you burn this shit, bad news.

711
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,372
Scott: Yeah, no, but I think what actually happened, right.

712
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:49,115
Scott: We already discussed in the first half how he'll go into great detail about aspects of the world.

713
00:39:49,135 --> 00:39:54,435
Scott: We'll talk about a sport or the elder glass towers or you know, the, the festivals or whatever.

714
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,398
Rym: Rose garden.

715
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:55,840
Scott: Right.

716
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,348
Scott: He'll go into all these all the roses.

717
00:39:57,409 --> 00:39:57,691
Scott: Oh fuck.

718
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:57,912
Scott: Yeah.

719
00:39:58,093 --> 00:39:59,482
Rym: They didn't tell a shit about that.

720
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:00,367
Scott: That shit was awesome.

721
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,614
Rym: No, no, that wasn't awesome.

722
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,564
Rym: What was awesome was the teacher in that room.

723
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:06,400
Scott: That's the other thing is all the teaching characters are always the best.

724
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,614
Scott: It's like, I just want to hear about that guy and chains.

725
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:09,339
Scott: Tell me their story.

726
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,600
Scott: Give me the prequel of chains in the war with the, with the guy who runs the military school.

727
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,146
Rym: favorite fucking character.

728
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:23,372
Rym: Chains is the equivalent of a, well, you didn't watch avatar, but uncle Iroh like that level of care.

729
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:25,281
Scott: How come they never write the book about that guy?

730
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,977
Scott: They always got to write a book about the apprentice of the better guy.

731
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:29,666
Scott: Give me the book about the better guy.

732
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:31,415
Scott: Tell me the story of chains.

733
00:40:31,455 --> 00:40:32,360
Scott: Give me the chain book.

734
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,646
Rym: Keep reading the Prince of nothing.

735
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:35,595
Rym: You know what it is now?

736
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:42,723
Rym: The second part, like the second trilogy you haven't read, you know, basically the great King, the God King is right now.

737
00:40:42,864 --> 00:40:45,415
Rym: And the great crusade of ancient days is right now.

738
00:40:45,615 --> 00:40:46,680
Rym: No, but all this is now.

739
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,067
Scott: No, I want to, I don't want to read that.

740
00:40:48,087 --> 00:40:50,159
Scott: I want to read about Siswatha who never shits.

741
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:51,644
Rym: That's all I want to read.

742
00:40:51,684 --> 00:40:52,388
Rym: Same story.

743
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,091
Rym: Oh, okay.

744
00:40:53,272 --> 00:40:54,417
Rym: It's basically all right.

745
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,611
Rym: The baddest ass wizard and the God King and everything.

746
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:02,272
Rym: This, this is basically the story that will be the story in the past of some other book.

747
00:41:02,513 --> 00:41:02,593
Scott: Yeah.

748
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:03,738
Scott: Cause I mean, Earthsea, right?

749
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:05,366
Scott: The story of Ged, Ged is the guy.

750
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:06,270
Scott: That's it, right?

751
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,014
Scott: He's the wizard.

752
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:10,848
Scott: He's, you know, in every, you know, there isn't really a Merlin of that world.

753
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:23,398
Scott: He's got an apprentice, he's got a master who's pretty awesome, but he surpasses that master and he is just, he becomes the Merlin and the Gandalf of that world, you know, and that's the story of him.

754
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:25,145
Scott: And that's kind of why Earthsea is awesome.

755
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:31,311
Scott: Uh, but this book is Locke Lamora is not the, uh, you know, the number one guy in this world.

756
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:33,401
Scott: And you don't even get to see the Duke whole book.

757
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:34,265
Scott: No Duke shows up.

758
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:36,314
Scott: They talk, everyone's talking about the Duke.

759
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,600
Scott: The Duke never appears.

760
00:41:38,021 --> 00:41:39,165
Scott: Not once.

761
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:40,610
Scott: Where is the Duke?

762
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,091
Scott: There is something.

763
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:41,995
Rym: He was at that party.

764
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:43,560
Scott: Did he say anything?

765
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,113
Scott: Did they even, was he a part of any scene actually?

766
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,385
Rym: I think they pointed out that he was standing somewhere.

767
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:49,511
Scott: I didn't see that.

768
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:52,591
Scott: I didn't re I don't remember that, but it could have, it could have been a sentence or two.

769
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:57,754
Scott: Like the Duke was standing in the corner, you know, but I did not, I saw no actual appearance of the Duke.

770
00:41:58,075 --> 00:42:02,872
Rym: So I was, I did not expect his con, you know, spoilers, spoilers.

771
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:09,540
Rym: I did not expect his con in the beginning to be when, when the Midnighters came and talked to the people who was conning.

772
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:10,966
Rym: I was like, wow, he's fucked.

773
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:11,468
Rym: All right, whatever.

774
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:12,532
Scott: No, I knew that.

775
00:42:12,712 --> 00:42:17,894
Scott: I see that the part with the Midnighters I saw through, I was like, oh, he is the Midnighter.

776
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:18,557
Scott: He's fooling.

777
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:19,240
Scott: Right.

778
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,593
Scott: But I didn't see what their, I thought at that.

779
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:23,925
Scott: when he did that though, I thought that the Midnighters were a myth.

780
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:27,985
Scott: And when there actually were Midnighters, that's what, that's when I was like, oh fuck.

781
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:32,364
Rym: I expected the Midnighters to come and things to get complicated, but not in the way they got.

782
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:38,516
Rym: What's kind of cool is there's this story, like the story was the con and like Locke and the secret piece and everything that's going along.

783
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:41,950
Rym: And then Gray King throws a monkey wrench in everything.

784
00:42:42,011 --> 00:42:44,423
Rym: And this is the part I wanted to touch on from before.

785
00:42:45,006 --> 00:42:47,136
Rym: the Gray King was disconnected from Locke completely.

786
00:42:47,217 --> 00:42:51,739
Rym: He just had his own bullshit to deal with and he had his own plan, his own revenge and all that stuff.

787
00:42:52,641 --> 00:43:00,924
Rym: But it was kind of interesting at the end when Locke is screaming at him when they're having their fight, when he's going to go kill the Gray King and he's basically saying, why'd you do this to us?

788
00:43:01,406 --> 00:43:02,892
Rym: You could have just had the fucking money.

789
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:04,699
Rym: We didn't want it.

790
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:13,130
Rym: And the fact that all that death and all the problems that Locke faced, he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, basically.

791
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,552
Rym: Yeah.

792
00:43:13,572 --> 00:43:22,245
Scott: I mean, but that at the same time, right, it's like, okay, you know, it might make sense that, you know, uh, this Gray King came out of left field like that.

793
00:43:22,587 --> 00:43:33,529
Scott: But story wise, because he came out of left field, even though it might be realistic or neat or original, it made me not really care so much about the Gray King plot because it was out of left field.

794
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:41,620
Scott: You know, you don't attach it because, you know, that would be, you know, more whatever you attach it so that I would actually care.

795
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,089
Rym: But that's the interesting part because I cared about all this other stuff and the Gray King just comes in and fucks everything up.

796
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:50,345
Scott: I really just didn't want the Gray King to plot to be there at all.

797
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:50,968
Scott: I was like, go away.

798
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:51,451
Scott: Great.

799
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:52,074
Rym: Look at Locke.

800
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:53,441
Rym: Locke felt the same way.

801
00:43:53,643 --> 00:43:54,929
Rym: He's got all his stuff going.

802
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,834
Rym: Everything's going awesome.

803
00:43:55,854 --> 00:43:57,201
Rym: Like, yeah, I got this con things.

804
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:59,634
Rym: And the Gray King throws a monkey wrench in his plans.

805
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:00,600
Rym: And what does he do?

806
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:01,624
Rym: He says, you know what?

807
00:44:01,966 --> 00:44:02,670
Rym: I can deal with this.

808
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:06,027
Rym: Let's just deal with the Gray King thing and keep doing our awesome stuff.

809
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:14,306
Rym: And the fact that that's like the turning point in the book when all his friends die and everything goes to shit because he had the same attitude that I had reading the book.

810
00:44:14,607 --> 00:44:15,332
Rym: Gray King, whatever.

811
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,297
Rym: I want to get back to this con.

812
00:44:16,398 --> 00:44:16,780
Rym: Oh, shit.

813
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,322
Rym: Gray King.

814
00:44:18,265 --> 00:44:19,651
Rym: Yeah, I like that part.

815
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:20,775
Rym: I like the way that was handled.

816
00:44:20,956 --> 00:44:24,311
Scott: I just I just, you know, I really I didn't want the Gray King story.

817
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:25,918
Scott: I wanted the the con story.

818
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:28,309
Rym: The con story would have been lame without something.

819
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:30,700
Scott: I was really fucking enjoying that con story.

820
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,146
Rym: It was so simple.

821
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:32,849
Scott: It was so good.

822
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,683
Scott: They could have just threw in one more twist on that and then ended it.

823
00:44:35,704 --> 00:44:37,032
Scott: They made the book a lot shorter.

824
00:44:37,213 --> 00:44:40,352
Rym: Plus, the Gray King was an excuse to bring in all these all these other aspects.

825
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:47,872
Scott: And then what you could have done is instead of bringing in the Gray King, right, is you take the back story of Locke that you were building and actually tied in instead of making me read the sequel.

826
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:49,379
Scott: I have the sequel.

827
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:49,903
Scott: I haven't read it yet.

828
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:50,830
Rym: I'm glad they didn't tie it in.

829
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:51,757
Rym: It was like a parallel thread.

830
00:44:51,777 --> 00:44:53,848
Rym: They were just flashbacks that served the purpose of.

831
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:56,702
Rym: I need to explain this away or I need to foreshadow this.

832
00:44:56,742 --> 00:45:00,625
Scott: Well, it is kind of good that they didn't tie it in in a way because it becomes more like the Godfather.

833
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:01,872
Scott: We're now in the second book.

834
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:06,216
Scott: Hopefully they will continue with the back story, which, you know, I always end up liking the back story.

835
00:45:06,256 --> 00:45:07,924
Scott: You know, it's Spider-Man 2099.

836
00:45:07,924 --> 00:45:16,123
Scott: After a bunch of issues, they actually started putting like this extra section in the back that had the back story from his childhood and actually ended up liking that a whole lot.

837
00:45:16,404 --> 00:45:18,955
Scott: You know, so hopefully I have the sequel.

838
00:45:18,995 --> 00:45:19,578
Scott: I'm going to read it.

839
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,006
Scott: Hopefully it continues the back story.

840
00:45:21,026 --> 00:45:23,783
Rym: Actually, the new Avatar series looks like he's going to do something similar.

841
00:45:23,803 --> 00:45:25,791
Scott: Which Avatar series is this?

842
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:26,655
Scott: The TV show.

843
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:28,462
Scott: So there's a new TV series?

844
00:45:28,502 --> 00:45:28,784
Scott: Yes.

845
00:45:28,924 --> 00:45:30,050
Scott: Even though there's a bad movie?

846
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:30,954
Rym: The movie is done.

847
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,280
Rym: No one cares about that.

848
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,424
Rym: That's not.

849
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,890
Rym: Shyamalan proved that he hates movies.

850
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,422
Scott: But the TV series didn't have an ending or did it?

851
00:45:37,462 --> 00:45:38,064
Rym: No, it did.

852
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:38,767
Rym: It ended.

853
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:41,318
Rym: The new series is going to happen in the same world.

854
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,905
Rym: It's takes place 70 years later.

855
00:45:42,925 --> 00:45:43,648
Rym: All right.

856
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:46,460
Rym: And the deal is basically that it's the next Avatar.

857
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:55,263
Rym: It's her story, but it'll flash back to kind of the denim on of the previous story that did end.

858
00:45:55,664 --> 00:46:05,999
Rym: So like you'll get flashbacks to like the back story of this new character is intertwined with like the X, like the follow up exposition of the previous story.

859
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:08,792
Scott: I never watched any Avatar, but you know, it's really good.

860
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:16,908
Scott: You should watch it and going with the things I've already said, they should tell the stories about the previous Avatar, who is like the most badass.

861
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:18,473
Rym: This one was that one.

862
00:46:18,493 --> 00:46:20,981
Scott: There wasn't there wasn't one before that.

863
00:46:21,002 --> 00:46:23,032
Scott: That was even more ancient and even more awesome.

864
00:46:23,173 --> 00:46:24,158
Rym: You get straight up.

865
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:26,129
Rym: You get to watch them hanging out with dragons.

866
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:26,793
Scott: All right.

867
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:27,235
Scott: All right.

868
00:46:27,255 --> 00:46:30,349
Rym: You should really, you should watch Avatar stuff going on.

869
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:34,246
Scott: You know, I've actually scarily almost watched all the Liji Matsumoto that matter.

870
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:36,319
Rym: So when you're done with all that, you should watch Avatar.

871
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:36,863
Rym: It's worth watching.

872
00:46:36,903 --> 00:46:37,770
Scott: I got other things going.

873
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,663
Rym: What if it were an anime and it was coming out right now?

874
00:46:39,683 --> 00:46:42,577
Scott: You know, I probably still, you know, I got other things to do.

875
00:46:42,597 --> 00:46:43,220
Rym: Like what?

876
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,482
Scott: Like shit.

877
00:46:45,346 --> 00:46:46,430
Rym: What are you going to do?

878
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,453
Rym: You run out of Yamato.

879
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:48,658
Scott: I already did.

880
00:46:48,878 --> 00:46:49,962
Rym: So what are you going to watch?

881
00:46:51,366 --> 00:46:52,690
Scott: Not Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

882
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:56,403
Rym: Anyway, so I made a bunch of predictions that fell through.

883
00:46:56,503 --> 00:46:58,090
Rym: Like I didn't think Nausicaa was actually dead.

884
00:46:59,436 --> 00:46:59,919
Scott: Oh, you didn't?

885
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:02,411
Rym: I thought she was behind, cause she winked at Locke, right?

886
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:08,200
Rym: This is me reading into stuff and then, and they're like, yeah, we'll get out of this arranged marriage that we don't care about.

887
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:10,852
Rym: But then she was winking and like, Hey, I got a plan.

888
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:11,314
Rym: You'll see.

889
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:13,866
Rym: And then, you know, she died and all that craziness.

890
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:16,136
Rym: I kind of expected that that was all her plan.

891
00:47:16,939 --> 00:47:18,107
Scott: Oh, I didn't even make that connection.

892
00:47:18,148 --> 00:47:25,747
Rym: They made the connection later that, you know, they went out in the funeral procession and they made a point of saying her body was not in the casket, but now now she's dead.

893
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:26,368
Scott: Yeah.

894
00:47:27,651 --> 00:47:29,134
Rym: I kind of liked the bonds mage.

895
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,726
Scott: You know who you reminded me of?

896
00:47:32,746 --> 00:47:33,933
Scott: You know, he reminded me of mom.

897
00:47:34,094 --> 00:47:37,331
Scott: Well, first of all, I liked him a lot, but I liked him in a bad hating.

898
00:47:37,352 --> 00:47:43,252
Rym: You reminded me of bullet tooth, Tony, a little bit because he just had this like, who the fuck are you?

899
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:45,378
Rym: Don't even talk to me.

900
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,791
Scott: I liked him a lot in the way that he's a bad guy.

901
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:48,897
Scott: You love to hate, right?

902
00:47:48,978 --> 00:47:58,216
Scott: But you know, he reminds me of in the Indiana Jones, that bald Nazi guy, it was all slimy and has the, as the, he turns his thing that looks like he's going to hurt someone.

903
00:47:58,236 --> 00:47:59,342
Scott: He turns it into a coat hanger.

904
00:47:59,783 --> 00:48:02,594
Rym: That guy, that scene was one of my favorite scenes.

905
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:04,481
Scott: That guy is the bonds mage.

906
00:48:04,561 --> 00:48:11,206
Scott: Cause he's just like so bad, but he's also so secretly dangerous, but he's also not, you don't want to fuck with him.

907
00:48:11,246 --> 00:48:15,403
Rym: He's evil dude, but he's evil in this very like contracted way.

908
00:48:15,423 --> 00:48:16,365
Rym: Like he doesn't care.

909
00:48:16,385 --> 00:48:30,440
Rym: He's just like, I don't care so much that I'm going to torture you because the guy paid me to and I can and because no one can touch me.

910
00:48:30,961 --> 00:48:32,705
Scott: You can't touch this.

911
00:48:32,725 --> 00:48:47,558
Scott: If no one could touch you for anything like you were just like the Kings of the world, if you say whatever you say, it'll be like, okay, you might not have a strong motivation to kill, you know, hurt to torture someone, but you can.

912
00:48:47,598 --> 00:48:48,582
Scott: So why the fuck not?

913
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,532
Scott: Cause you're just so bad and evil and a jerk.

914
00:48:52,756 --> 00:48:56,471
Rym: He said towards the end when he's like, all right, uh, gene kill lock.

915
00:48:56,511 --> 00:49:01,645
Rym: And he's about to have this like, oh wait, now stop lock kill Jane.

916
00:49:01,966 --> 00:49:02,387
Rym: Yeah.

917
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:07,706
Rym: Like I can picture that scene in the movie being like awesome and hilarious at the same time.

918
00:49:07,887 --> 00:49:08,168
Rym: Yeah.

919
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:11,781
Rym: Cause he's like, no, no, no, wait, I've got a better idea.

920
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:16,254
Scott: It was a better idea, but it was also, it was the wrong idea.

921
00:49:16,274 --> 00:49:16,997
Scott: Stupid idea.

922
00:49:17,017 --> 00:49:17,097
Rym: Yeah.

923
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,967
Scott: Because like, as soon as, as soon as he said, as soon as he said, no way, I was like, okay, how are they going to get out of this?

924
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:25,262
Scott: And as soon as he said, no, wait, I have a better idea.

925
00:49:25,282 --> 00:49:26,427
Scott: I'm like, that's how he's getting out of it.

926
00:49:26,768 --> 00:49:38,020
Rym: So that whole bit, basically I love the bit toward the end cause we can't, you know, just skipping around in this where they have nothing and he's got to get a disguise and like start everything up again from nothing.

927
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:42,058
Rym: So he tries like the bullshit plan number one and the bullshit plan number two.

928
00:49:42,078 --> 00:49:46,257
Rym: And then like the only plan that works in the end is like the ludicrous plan.

929
00:49:46,337 --> 00:49:48,849
Scott: I do like how he tries these multiple plans.

930
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:49,471
Scott: They don't work.

931
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:56,343
Scott: But what I, I kind of feel that it was a little bit forced because there had to be some simpler plan where he could have gotten some clothes.

932
00:49:56,403 --> 00:49:56,966
Rym: Are you kidding?

933
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,497
Rym: Those clothes were like a thousand crowns.

934
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:06,112
Scott: I'm just saying there had to be a way he could have just like freaking stolen some clothes, like tied a guy up in an alley or something and taken his clothes.

935
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:08,444
Rym: You know, he's not a good fighter and he's alone.

936
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,810
Rym: That's true.

937
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:15,902
Scott: But I mean, all right, go into someone's house and take the clothes out of their cabinet, you know, but there's security and guards in the fancy person's houses.

938
00:50:16,203 --> 00:50:17,147
Rym: He can't steal from anyone.

939
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:18,453
Scott: Paul sneak in.

940
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:21,786
Scott: He's done that before he snuck into the friggin Don's house with as the midnight.

941
00:50:21,806 --> 00:50:24,416
Rym: Plus he needed ultra fancy clothes.

942
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:25,420
Scott: Yeah.

943
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,490
Scott: The Don's house had ultra fancy clothes.

944
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,099
Rym: How's he going to break into the Don's house?

945
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,143
Scott: He did it before.

946
00:50:30,303 --> 00:50:30,524
Scott: Yeah.

947
00:50:30,604 --> 00:50:31,568
Rym: At night with help.

948
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:32,250
Scott: Yeah.

949
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,415
Scott: Well, you know, yeah.

950
00:50:33,716 --> 00:50:34,740
Rym: Also not busted up.

951
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:38,032
Scott: He could have gone in, sewn some clothes.

952
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:40,060
Rym: How that whole plan comes together was so.

953
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,209
Rym: Lupin, you know, he sneaks in.

954
00:50:42,369 --> 00:50:44,679
Rym: like he sneaks in, he bribes the one gay bribes.

955
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:50,123
Rym: The other guy prized the third and also like in, uh, the Leonardo DiCaprio movie, the, when he's the con man.

956
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:52,796
Scott: Oh, that one where he prints the fake checks.

957
00:50:52,836 --> 00:50:54,243
Rym: Why do I forget the name of that movie?

958
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:54,967
Scott: I forget it.

959
00:50:55,027 --> 00:50:56,033
Rym: I feel really stupid now.

960
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,420
Scott: I actually see that in a theater.

961
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:57,721
Rym: Yeah.

962
00:50:57,761 --> 00:50:59,089
Rym: We all saw in the theater together.

963
00:50:59,391 --> 00:50:59,813
Scott: Oh wow.

964
00:50:59,914 --> 00:51:00,376
Scott: I don't remember.

965
00:51:00,397 --> 00:51:00,799
Rym: Regardless.

966
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:03,913
Scott: Remember the scene where he was the one that was based on a real guy.

967
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:04,275
Scott: Yeah.

968
00:51:04,697 --> 00:51:12,931
Rym: So remember when he, uh, the, uh, Tom Hanks comes in to arrest him and he flashes his wallet, like he's got a badge and then he says, yeah, we already got the guy.

969
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:22,232
Rym: We arrested him and he waves out the window at the cop who's leading the other guy away and the guy just kind of waves back and then that like seals the deal on the con.

970
00:51:22,855 --> 00:51:34,235
Rym: The lock basically did the exact same thing like four times with the one guard and the other guard and he's bribing everybody and then pretending to be the guy who's pretending to bribe people for the guy.

971
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:34,335
Scott: Yeah.

972
00:51:34,797 --> 00:51:36,583
Rym: That was all awesome.

973
00:51:36,744 --> 00:51:45,368
Rym: It was pretty, you know, it's, it's always, when he gets, when he gets the, the merchant guy locked up in his room, he just fucking throws the orchid away and walks away like, all right, I'm done.

974
00:51:45,388 --> 00:51:45,650
Rym: Yeah.

975
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,766
Scott: It's like whenever you're, when you're an engineer nerd type like us, right?

976
00:51:48,846 --> 00:51:52,520
Scott: If you see just an awesome plan happen, it's just so fun.

977
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,088
Scott: Especially if it's a clever plan.

978
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:55,676
Scott: It's the same thing with like a clever joke.

979
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:02,307
Scott: Even if it's a really racist joke or something that's offensive, the construction of the joke in and of itself can be so awesome.

980
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,960
Scott: It just makes you feel good as a, as a nerd type of person.

981
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:17,266
Scott: So it's the plan, even if it's an unrealistic plan or if the, you know, the content of the plan is stupid or evil as long as you just, you just watching the construction of the plan is like looking at a computer program.

982
00:52:17,306 --> 00:52:18,772
Scott: It's like, ah, so glorious.

983
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:19,775
Scott: Awesome.

984
00:52:20,357 --> 00:52:21,060
Rym: The NSMB.

985
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:21,781
Rym: Yeah.

986
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:22,183
Rym: Yup.

987
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:26,478
Rym: So at the end, and I'm sure you noticed this, but they kept it.

988
00:52:26,698 --> 00:52:32,088
Rym: I like how gene like all the side stores where they go to stay at all the priesthoods when he goes to stay at the death priesthood.

989
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:33,777
Scott: Yeah, that was actually a cool story.

990
00:52:33,857 --> 00:52:34,098
Scott: But when

991
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:47,565
Rym: he runs away and like he leaves the name and the note and then he uses that name again later and then lock uses the same name even later just because, but you know, toward the end when like everyone knows who everyone is like, yeah, I'm the, I'm the this, you're the, that you're the spider.

992
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:48,289
Rym: We're all cool.

993
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:50,922
Rym: Let's deal with this crazy Wraith stone that we're all afraid of.

994
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:54,617
Rym: Like I liked that whole scene because he's being totally honest.

995
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:54,798
Scott: Yeah.

996
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,854
Scott: They actually approached it, you know, pretty, it was like, no one was stupid in this scene.

997
00:52:58,874 --> 00:53:01,966
Scott: None of the people were like being jerks about it.

998
00:53:02,027 --> 00:53:06,505
Scott: Even the Don who was like, ah, it's like, listen, don't forget the Don.

999
00:53:06,928 --> 00:53:18,472
Rym: I think a character I like to, we don't get too much is the Don's bodyguard because that guy was like, he was portrayed at first as kind of like a thug and like the Don and the Danya or Donna were kind of portrayed

1000
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:18,833
Scott: on

1001
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:25,198
Rym: a as bad or like likes getting them, but they were both kind of cool and bad ass in their own, right?

1002
00:53:25,218 --> 00:53:25,700
Rym: I don't know.

1003
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,136
Scott: I think the Midnighter lady was definitely much more bad ass.

1004
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:32,975
Rym: Oh, of course she was, but she was a lot older, more experienced, but those two were cool.

1005
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:36,993
Rym: But their assistant, like when he catches Locke at the end, he's like, you fucker.

1006
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:38,380
Rym: And Locke's like, no, seriously.

1007
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:43,963
Rym: And then like, as the truth is coming out, he's kind of just smirking like, you know, this is kind of awesome.

1008
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:44,886
Rym: I'm just going to hang back.

1009
00:53:45,629 --> 00:53:46,271
Rym: I get it now.

1010
00:53:48,218 --> 00:53:48,780
Rym: I like that guy.

1011
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:49,320
Rym: Yeah.

1012
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:56,146
Rym: I don't know why I pictured him as looking like the guy who is the bodyguard to the bad guy in Moulin Rouge.

1013
00:53:56,246 --> 00:54:00,363
Scott: He reminded me more of like Sagat from street fighter, you know, that kind of guy.

1014
00:54:00,383 --> 00:54:01,026
Rym: Similar guy.

1015
00:54:01,186 --> 00:54:01,467
Scott: Yeah.

1016
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:04,520
Rym: But at the end, Locke's telling the truth to everybody.

1017
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:09,143
Rym: He's like, look, that did it, did it, did it, did it, and great King did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it.

1018
00:54:09,564 --> 00:54:15,126
Rym: And notice how he seamlessly turns from actual truth to straight up lies.

1019
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:19,604
Rym: Oh, and the ship, you've got to bomb the ship because you've got to get rid of that thing.

1020
00:54:19,825 --> 00:54:20,488
Rym: Cause it's bad.

1021
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:23,019
Rym: And my name, my real name's Taver and all that.

1022
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,948
Rym: He just shifts into the straight up lies.

1023
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:26,470
Scott: Yup.

1024
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:28,960
Rym: Like that was the climax of the book.

1025
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,687
Rym: That was like the pinnacle moment of yes.

1026
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:31,871
Rym: Locke lies.

1027
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:32,574
Scott: Yup.

1028
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:35,288
Rym: Cause he didn't lie all that much up until that point.

1029
00:54:35,308 --> 00:54:37,462
Scott: No, I mean, it's called the lies of Locke Lammers.

1030
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,386
Scott: Like, well, which lies were?

1031
00:54:38,427 --> 00:54:40,055
Scott: there was the lie about that, right?

1032
00:54:40,075 --> 00:54:43,349
Scott: Uh, there was the lies that he told that he was trying to get close.

1033
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:51,991
Scott: when he's conning, he's lying, but I, and it's also sort of weird that the books from the perspective, you know, it's like, it's you, the book is about the con, right?

1034
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:58,726
Scott: Or the conning and they show you enough of the con because if they don't show you any of it, then it's like, well, you don't get the, Oh man, that's so awesome.

1035
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:06,596
Scott: But they show you some, but then they don't show you like that final bit of each one, you know, until the time is right.

1036
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:07,158
Scott: Yup.

1037
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:11,660
Scott: So that way they can at least pull something on you that get, that gives them excitement and twisting.

1038
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:17,336
Rym: But I guess it's just that all the characters that matter in the story aren't stupid.

1039
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:18,659
Scott: Yeah.

1040
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,730
Scott: And I don't think, is there anyone at all who's stupid?

1041
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,613
Scott: I mean, some people get conned, but it's like anyone would be conned, even a smart person.

1042
00:55:26,935 --> 00:55:27,156
Rym: Yeah.

1043
00:55:27,216 --> 00:55:27,940
Scott: They're not stupid.

1044
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,413
Scott: They're just, they got, they got fooled, you know, of course.

1045
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:42,269
Rym: I mean, the title could allude to, cause you know, in his backstory, how he basically got all those kids killed because until he understood like what it means to lie and con and like the consequences of things, he got a whole bunch of kids murdered.

1046
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:42,851
Scott: Yup.

1047
00:55:43,052 --> 00:55:44,498
Rym: And you know, he dealt with that.

1048
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:49,102
Rym: and then I kind of liked the way they dealt with that throughout the story and how he learned his lessons.

1049
00:55:49,142 --> 00:56:01,275
Scott: and yeah, the thing is, is right is the part of his childhood that is, you know, you don't, you only get up to a certain point, you know, you don't get the, like you don't learn anything about Savathur or how he, of course not more books.

1050
00:56:01,617 --> 00:56:01,918
Scott: Yeah.

1051
00:56:01,978 --> 00:56:02,199
Scott: Right.

1052
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:04,491
Scott: But it's like, that's definitely the cooler part.

1053
00:56:04,592 --> 00:56:07,646
Scott: It's sort of the same situation where you don't get the story of the cool old Kings.

1054
00:56:08,047 --> 00:56:14,975
Scott: The cool part would be when, you know, lock in the other guys, you know, they said they had ripped off like how many dons already.

1055
00:56:14,995 --> 00:56:15,538
Scott: Yup.

1056
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:17,165
Scott: And that's, that's the cool part.

1057
00:56:17,185 --> 00:56:20,482
Scott: Just give me a book where they rip off those other dons and that's the whole book.

1058
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:26,311
Rym: I kind of like the, the, the fact that they keep using the currency until you start to get a sense of what they're worth.

1059
00:56:26,894 --> 00:56:30,090
Rym: And then you think back, you're like, he had 40,000 crowns just in a pit.

1060
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:32,663
Scott: Well, yeah, they tell you like what a crown is worth, like, Holy shit.

1061
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:36,042
Scott: And then they talk about how many, you know, how many crowns it's like, Oh, fuck me.

1062
00:56:36,403 --> 00:56:36,684
Scott: Right.

1063
00:56:37,165 --> 00:56:40,295
Scott: A crown is like a thousand dollars more than that.

1064
00:56:40,456 --> 00:56:40,857
Scott: A lot.

1065
00:56:41,138 --> 00:56:41,720
Scott: It's a crown.

1066
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,603
Scott: It's only shit.

1067
00:56:43,086 --> 00:56:46,000
Scott: Like you could shave a little bit off a crown and you'll be fricking loaded.

1068
00:56:46,381 --> 00:56:50,237
Rym: So notice how the style of the speech in the book was straight up vernacular.

1069
00:56:50,277 --> 00:56:52,545
Rym: You fuckers, asshole, jerk.

1070
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:54,313
Scott: I'll get you.

1071
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:55,016
Scott: It's a fantasy world.

1072
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:55,960
Scott: You can make it whatever you want.

1073
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:56,200
Rym: Yeah.

1074
00:56:56,221 --> 00:56:57,728
Rym: But I liked it too often.

1075
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:03,190
Rym: You don't see this in like, if you do, if you do the these and the thows, but it's more.

1076
00:57:03,571 --> 00:57:09,514
Rym: look at other fantasy books on this level, the ones that are well written, but not like masterfully written.

1077
00:57:09,534 --> 00:57:11,964
Rym: Like the writing is not special, but have a good story.

1078
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:13,149
Rym: They're a little pulpy and fun.

1079
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:18,492
Rym: They tend to either make up a bunch of proper nouns that characters use for like swearing.

1080
00:57:19,155 --> 00:57:22,310
Rym: Like they have their fake swear words, fake swear words, stick out like a sore thumb.

1081
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:26,487
Scott: I don't like, I'm not a fan or they'll use like, they'll like.

1082
00:57:26,507 --> 00:57:29,376
Rym: the language will be very God that con matter back.

1083
00:57:29,437 --> 00:57:33,574
Scott: Well, they do have plenty of proper nouns in this book that are guarded.

1084
00:57:33,595 --> 00:57:39,060
Rym: They don't use it in the way that the more decks are used in those lesser, like not as well or in the fantasy.

1085
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:49,581
Rym: This is true that here it kind of pointedly is in the vernacular to remind you like these are normal people, you know, who talk to each other in a vernacular language in a fantastical world.

1086
00:57:50,123 --> 00:57:50,585
Rym: Like it did.

1087
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:54,517
Rym: And once I think it works, it didn't stick out.

1088
00:57:54,557 --> 00:57:55,460
Scott: You know, I didn't also.

1089
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:56,264
Rym: they're in a city.

1090
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:57,652
Rym: It's kind of like New Yorkers.

1091
00:57:57,713 --> 00:57:58,578
Rym: They just say, fuck a lot.

1092
00:57:58,598 --> 00:57:59,322
Rym: Cause that's what you do.

1093
00:57:59,362 --> 00:58:00,508
Scott: I didn't notice it.

1094
00:58:00,548 --> 00:58:03,041
Scott: It didn't bother me, which means that's the right way to do it.

1095
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:06,556
Scott: You know, it's, it's bad when it stands out and you notice something.

1096
00:58:07,038 --> 00:58:13,648
Rym: I also like how they use a lot of Italian ish or even just straight up Italian words, the Venetian references references.

1097
00:58:13,808 --> 00:58:15,975
Rym: Most of them are references to mafia stuff.

1098
00:58:16,317 --> 00:58:16,618
Scott: Yeah.

1099
00:58:16,778 --> 00:58:18,505
Rym: Because there's the whole mafia thing.

1100
00:58:18,566 --> 00:58:20,013
Scott: That's the whole, that's what's going on.

1101
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:20,374
Scott: Yeah.

1102
00:58:20,816 --> 00:58:24,192
Scott: He's got, he's brought in, you know, the magic plus the mafia.

1103
00:58:24,212 --> 00:58:24,875
Scott: How often is that?

1104
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:27,104
Scott: You know, I mean, I guess it's halflings and D and D right.

1105
00:58:27,124 --> 00:58:28,168
Scott: Same kind of situation.

1106
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:28,550
Rym: Yeah.

1107
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:35,004
Rym: So I guess, I dunno, I, we should probably end this, but I could just keep talking about, Oh, it was awesome when blah happened.

1108
00:58:35,627 --> 00:58:37,014
Scott: But I mean, that's pretty much the whole book.

1109
00:58:37,276 --> 00:58:38,140
Scott: A bunch of things happen.

1110
00:58:38,341 --> 00:58:39,549
Scott: It's awesome when they happen.

1111
00:58:39,569 --> 00:58:40,615
Scott: That's all there is to it.

1112
00:58:40,636 --> 00:58:41,843
Rym: Reading these until they Peter out.

1113
00:58:41,864 --> 00:58:42,488
Scott: I thought you want her.

1114
00:58:42,548 --> 00:58:43,334
Scott: I got the second one.

1115
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:44,583
Scott: I'll read it and then I'll give it to you.

1116
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:44,704
Scott: Yeah.

1117
00:58:44,724 --> 00:58:46,339
Rym: I'll probably just keep reading them until I get sick of them.

1118
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:47,806
Rym: Like the, those are the Temeraire books.

1119
00:58:49,032 --> 00:58:51,121
Scott: They've already said there's going to be a whole bunch of them.

1120
00:58:51,141 --> 00:58:52,225
Scott: So boy.

1121
00:58:52,245 --> 00:58:52,787
Rym: Yeah.

1122
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:53,891
Rym: But they're fun enough.

1123
00:58:54,593 --> 00:58:54,854
Scott: Yeah.

1124
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:57,624
Rym: I mean, it's just, I got to read until I find out a couple of things.

1125
00:58:57,745 --> 00:59:00,214
Rym: I want to know more about Wraith stone.

1126
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,523
Scott: I mean, what's more to know about it.

1127
00:59:02,723 --> 00:59:08,766
Rym: I want to know, like I'm sure we're going to see it used for bad and gotten away with.

1128
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:11,261
Scott: Well, I think what actually, you know, the thing is with the Wraith stone, right?

1129
00:59:11,302 --> 00:59:13,151
Scott: It's like they tell you about it, but you don't.

1130
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:16,306
Scott: And the thing is, I was, I, she was like, shame on me, right?

1131
00:59:16,326 --> 00:59:19,723
Scott: Cause it's such a Chekhov's gun, the Wraith stone, big time Chekhov's gun.

1132
00:59:19,783 --> 00:59:23,135
Scott: Like it was Chekhov's elephant in the room, right?

1133
00:59:23,316 --> 00:59:23,496
Scott: Right.

1134
00:59:23,657 --> 00:59:29,136
Scott: But the problem with that is that there were so many Chekhov's guns, right?

1135
00:59:29,156 --> 00:59:30,802
Scott: Because he told you about the sport.

1136
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:38,976
Scott: He told you, he went into great detail about so many things in the world that the Wraith stone Chekhov's gun blended with all these false Chekhov's.

1137
00:59:39,016 --> 00:59:40,000
Rym: It was easy to spot it.

1138
00:59:40,061 --> 00:59:40,763
Rym: It's Scooby dude.

1139
00:59:40,904 --> 00:59:47,747
Rym: Every other aside was a contained aside and maybe it was referenced later, but it didn't come up again later.

1140
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:51,660
Rym: However, the gentle stuff kept coming up.

1141
00:59:51,961 --> 00:59:53,788
Rym: He was like, Jen, this was gentle.

1142
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:54,552
Rym: This wasn't gentle.

1143
00:59:54,752 --> 01:00:01,038
Scott: He preferred gentle, but he's still his, his use of, you know, it was basically, it was hiding in the crowd, right?

1144
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:05,756
Scott: The Wraith stone aside that told you all about Wraith stone hit amongst all the other ones.

1145
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:11,122
Scott: And even when I read the aside about Wraith stone, I thought, Oh man, this is going to come up later.

1146
01:00:11,162 --> 01:00:12,791
Scott: But when it came up later, I was like, fuck me.

1147
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:14,038
Scott: Why didn't I remember earlier?

1148
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:15,003
Rym: He got me.

1149
01:00:15,103 --> 01:00:16,129
Rym: There was just the aside.

1150
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:16,531
Rym: All right.

1151
01:00:16,752 --> 01:00:23,802
Rym: There was a lot of things that just had an aside Wraith stone had the aside and it also had constant mentions throughout the entire book.

1152
01:00:23,942 --> 01:00:24,204
Scott: Yeah.

1153
01:00:24,344 --> 01:00:28,607
Scott: I should have remembered it though, but I didn't until he actually brought it up at the end and I was like, Oh damn it.

1154
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:29,914
Scott: Why didn't I remember it?

1155
01:00:29,995 --> 01:00:31,281
Scott: I should have remembered it.

1156
01:00:32,426 --> 01:00:36,100
Scott: I even knew that it was a Chekhov's gun and then I forgot that it was Chekhov's gun.

1157
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:42,309
Scott: It's like, it's like a Chekhov standing there holding this gun and he holds it there for an hour and then like, right.

1158
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:49,847
Scott: He puts it away into a drawer and you see him put it away in the drawer and then 10 minutes later he takes it out and shoots you with it and you're like, Oh, I forgot you put it in the drawer.

1159
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:59,926
Rym: So the other thing I want to know is I really at some point want to know what blew that hole in that one elder, elder glass tower and how, Oh yeah.

1160
01:01:00,087 --> 01:01:02,276
Scott: Also you got to know about Sabbatha, right?

1161
01:01:02,336 --> 01:01:02,537
Rym: Yeah.

1162
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:03,240
Rym: And the Rose garden.

1163
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:04,989
Rym: I want to, I want to know like more about that.

1164
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:12,627
Scott: And also I want to see the bonds mages come come, you know, let's see if they really, they're probably going to come and fucking, you know, locks.

1165
01:01:12,647 --> 01:01:13,912
Rym: whole thing was, Oh, I didn't kill him.

1166
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:14,656
Rym: I didn't kill him.

1167
01:01:14,696 --> 01:01:15,299
Rym: It's okay.

1168
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,291
Rym: But look at the way they handled every other technicality in this book.

1169
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:19,516
Rym: It is not okay.

1170
01:01:19,998 --> 01:01:24,397
Scott: No, I want to see the bonds majors and come back big time and that's going to be hopefully Epic.

1171
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:26,107
Scott: Hopefully that's just the end of the book.

1172
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:31,876
Scott: The like the end of the last book, the bonds may just come and it's just like, well, boom, every year fucking toast and that's it.

1173
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:35,821
Scott: Just leave them out of it until the very last book and then bring them back and there's no stopping them.

1174
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:37,388
Scott: And that's cause there is no stopping them.

1175
01:01:37,971 --> 01:01:42,225
Rym: Maybe there is some sort of elder glass technology elder guns.

1176
01:01:42,245 --> 01:01:43,650
Rym: Uh, yeah.

1177
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:52,046
Scott: If they bring the world into it though, then you lose the good parts of the cowboy VVOP thing of having a world that isn't the store where the world is not the story.

1178
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:54,055
Scott: I don't want the world to become the story.

1179
01:01:54,156 --> 01:01:54,799
Rym: It doesn't have to.

1180
01:01:54,819 --> 01:02:02,498
Rym: He can keep revealing stuff as asides and just in the course of telling his other stories because we learned a lot about elder glass and they just didn't learn everything.

1181
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:03,886
Scott: What'd you learn about elder glass besides?

1182
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:04,429
Scott: that is old.

1183
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:13,697
Rym: We learned this indestructible and they keep talking about like the alchemical stuff and how, how it plays with lied and like, well, this one has a hole in it, so something can destroy it, but we don't know what.

1184
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:17,121
Rym: And then like the rose garden, like, well, there's this kind of, maybe they made it with a hole in it.

1185
01:02:17,904 --> 01:02:22,198
Rym: so they keep, he can tell us more about the world without making the world.

1186
01:02:22,219 --> 01:02:23,585
Scott: The plot could be diamonds.

1187
01:02:23,745 --> 01:02:24,831
Scott: Does the world have diamonds?

1188
01:02:25,012 --> 01:02:27,545
Rym: And he's got to keep telling us stuff about the world, you know?

1189
01:02:27,565 --> 01:02:28,872
Scott: Well, I mean, that was half.

1190
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,581
Scott: the book was just descriptions of the world.

1191
01:02:30,943 --> 01:02:32,811
Scott: So the next book is just as large.

1192
01:02:32,912 --> 01:02:35,747
Scott: It's gotta be descriptions of the world, but they're also traveling.

1193
01:02:35,787 --> 01:02:38,061
Scott: So it's going to be descriptions about a different geographic area.

1194
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:38,965
Rym: Here's what I expect.

1195
01:02:39,287 --> 01:02:50,708
Rym: I expect at some point in this book series, a character is going to stumble upon either like the mummy of the elders who made the glass or a tomb or something related to them.

1196
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:52,937
Scott: that is an old Herman who knows all the secrets.

1197
01:02:53,198 --> 01:02:54,464
Rym: Something like that.

1198
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:55,671
Scott: It's a secret to everybody.

1199
01:02:55,691 --> 01:02:58,103
Rym: They're not going to tell us all the secrets, but they're definitely going to.

1200
01:02:58,445 --> 01:02:59,529
Scott: I'm telling you the secret.

1201
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:00,834
Scott: Why you old man attack.

1202
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,185
Rym: I'm giving you the security system.

1203
01:03:04,226 --> 01:03:06,272
Scott: Northwest, Southwest is the way.

1204
01:03:07,556 --> 01:03:08,258
Rym: I think we're done.

1205
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:10,866
Rym: Lies of Locke Lammer, Scott Lynch, worth reading.

1206
01:03:11,468 --> 01:03:17,653
Rym: If anyone out there has money and it hasn't already been done, option the rights to make this movie.

1207
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:19,300
Rym: This movie would do really, really, really well.

1208
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,762
Scott: And Dodongo dislikes smoke.

1209
01:03:29,088 --> 01:03:31,250
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1210
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:36,534
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

1211
01:03:36,735 --> 01:03:41,814
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1212
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:44,726
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1213
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:49,484
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1214
01:03:49,806 --> 01:03:53,821
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1215
01:03:54,242 --> 01:03:57,315
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1216
01:03:57,516 --> 01:04:00,410
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
