1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,992
Rym: It's Thursday October 24th 2019.

2
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:15,108
Rym: I'm random Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:22,069
Rym: tonight We are talking about sleep the thing that mammals do to keep their brains from going crazy.

4
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:23,976
Scott: You saying snakes don't sleep.

5
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:25,461
Rym: Oh snakes also other things.

6
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:27,086
Rym: I didn't say other things don't sleep.

7
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:30,496
Scott: I just said mammals do it Saying that all mammals sleep.

8
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,223
Rym: Oh, yes all mammals sleep.

9
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:32,986
Rym: I'm confident.

10
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:33,729
Rym: I'm not wrong there.

11
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:36,288
Scott: Let's do this.

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,387
Rym: So a Thing about if you don't live in New York or a few other places on earth like I'd like.

13
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:48,950
Rym: when I lived in Michigan I liked fireworks, but I thought I'd seen good firework shows.

14
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:59,630
Rym: I knew I had seen good firework shows because I was near enough to New York, but then I moved to New York and I saw a firework shows done by like for real professionals, right?

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,663
Scott: So if you don't know the best fireworks on earth There are three places that I know of at least that make the best fireworks on earth.

16
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:06,727
Scott: a number one China.

17
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:10,598
Scott: Yeah, literally just the Chinese government fireworks.

18
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,623
Rym: I mean, I've seen some videos.

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,589
Rym: Yeah, holy shit, right Disney?

20
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,998
Scott: Disney Does fireworks like daily?

21
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:19,449
Scott: Yep, so they got really fucking good at it, right?

22
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,750
Scott: Yeah, I spent a lot of money on it those Epcot fireworks.

23
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,229
Rym: I had a real good time right in three.

24
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:34,188
Scott: There's an Italian family the garucci family and they do it a best of firework with the racist Italian accent And a lot of times in New York like when I was growing up right.

25
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,110
Scott: nowadays If you go to like say fireworks at the baseball stadium on July 4th, right?

26
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,164
Scott: Yeah, you see some fucking garbage sponsored by Verizon.

27
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:49,970
Scott: not even fireworks But back in the day pretty much all the real, you know, fireworks shows in New York are grouchy fireworks.

28
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:53,584
Scott: Now the only ones I see that are still grouchy are the Astoria ones.

29
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,139
Scott: I don't think the Macy's ones are them you know, but The Astoria ones are now.

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,511
Rym: I'm not saying like regular old fireworks Like.

31
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:02,416
Rym: I still enjoy like.

32
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,870
Rym: I just like fireworks no matter what like even if they're kind of bad.

33
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,943
Scott: I'll set one off right here.

34
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:08,377
Rym: See what the Depends on what kind of firework.

35
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:08,979
Rym: firecrackers.

36
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,914
Scott: You know the big guy how big Smiley face.

37
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:23,070
Rym: good, but like the difference between a regular old firework and the kind of fireworks We're talking about are that like, you know when there's a composer who's kind of naive versus the composer who's just a master?

38
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:25,918
Rym: It's about the composition and the timing.

39
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,022
Rym: like a good fire.

40
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,590
Rym: really good proper fireworks show will actually surprise you.

41
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:33,081
Rym: It'll use colors that are difficult to make and use.

42
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:38,377
Scott: you'll see little cost more money last longer Yeah And better synchronize with music.

43
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,923
Rym: and the best heuristic I can give you.

44
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:45,370
Rym: if you're not sure if the virus is higher bigger Let me writer like I like cheap one and I like expensive one.

45
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:56,210
Rym: But with fireworks the way to know if a firework show is more legit Generally cheaper firework shows the the finale tends just be a whole bunch of bullshit all at once and then it stops.

46
00:02:56,953 --> 00:03:08,114
Rym: But a real firework show the whole bunch of bullshit will still seem very Choreographed and have like an ebb and a flow and like it'll rise and rise and rise to a climax like you'll.

47
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:17,770
Rym: you can notice these differences like watch a bunch of firework shows on YouTube, so There are two factors enjoying fireworks because I saw last weekend the best firework show I've ever seen in my life.

48
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:26,742
Scott: See the best fireworks ever in October which isn't a hot firework time for anybody Not at Disney World.

49
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:32,630
Scott: you didn't go to China So you didn't use a time machine, so there's two factors.

50
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:37,390
Scott: You go to like the fireworks factory, and there was like a demo like they were testing out their shit.

51
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:38,848
Rym: Oh, we went to the box factory.

52
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:46,526
Rym: So because there's day like with wine there are two factors in terms of not just our.

53
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:47,870
Rym: is this the best one or our?

54
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:56,350
Rym: These the best fireworks, but it's also were these that was this the best wine I ever had the best experience I ever had for like with gaming crystal chronicles.

55
00:03:56,814 --> 00:04:07,722
Rym: Not the best game ever true But the way we played crystal chronicles that experience was one of my best gaming experiences ever Mm-hmm because the experience was really good.

56
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:11,983
Rym: the game was a big part of that But the game by itself was not like that.

57
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:13,249
Rym: good on its own mm-hmm.

58
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:14,535
Scott: I mean, that's the same thing.

59
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:19,536
Scott: if you eat a delicious food right it might not be The five-star restaurant food.

60
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:22,830
Scott: it might be three-star restaurant food, but if you are mad hungry

61
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:23,512
Rym: Yeah,

62
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:28,589
Scott: and if you were say with some good people, or you know someone cooked it for you

63
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,433
Rym: Yeah, right

64
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:37,024
Scott: then suddenly that could be even a better experience than five-star food even though if you put it next to five-star food you but yeah the five-star food is tastier.

65
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:46,949
Rym: a piece of like oh Like Oh maka say like Oh toro sushi from the finest master When I'm just like gonna have some sushi would be equally enjoyable, too.

66
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:50,587
Rym: Here's a crab stick because Rym you literally haven't eaten in two days right?

67
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:59,158
Scott: or like you know I could make a steak on the grill in the backyard and that could be as good as At least the experience could be as good as you know.

68
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,690
Scott: the the most expensive wagyu right yep.

69
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:06,365
Rym: So for a zillion dollar the fireworks show I saw.

70
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:07,290
Rym: so here's the deal.

71
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,770
Rym: We're at a wedding all weekend like upstate staying at this quaint little hotel and like North Branch.

72
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:13,250
Rym: It was really fun and a lot of stuff happened to this wedding.

73
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:22,750
Rym: There was a thing on like the itinerary Like after the dinner before the cake where they're like we're gonna go outside with sparklers and take night photos, okay?

74
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,675
Scott: All right, that's cool.

75
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:24,158
Scott: You can do.

76
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:28,061
Scott: you can do a long exposure You can draw with if it's dark enough right out.

77
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:31,398
Scott: you do a long exposure with the camera And then you draw with the sparkler.

78
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,229
Rym: so this was in fact a trick.

79
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:35,115
Rym: Uh-huh this was a trap.

80
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:45,950
Rym: so we go outside, and there's a whole bunch of giant like for real sparklers And there's a path of like blue glow sticks like going off and away.

81
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,150
Rym: So take a sparkler and light it and start walking down this path.

82
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,133
Rym: There's a line of us walking down this path the sparklers run out Just as we get to the end of the path like they were timed Mm-hmm.

83
00:05:56,434 --> 00:06:00,409
Rym: and at the end of the path they turn red and they form a circle mm-hmm.

84
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,722
Rym: So I'm near the front of the line, so I'm like hmm is this?

85
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:07,296
Rym: knowing the people are getting married the first thing I think is is this a jump scare?

86
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:08,801
Rym: is that are they gonna?

87
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:10,407
Rym: is this adjacent gonna pop out?

88
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:11,270
Rym: cuz that would be amazing.

89
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:13,098
Scott: How much I spent on this.

90
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:14,950
Rym: uh so the way?

91
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,466
Rym: I'll put it is there's two ways to have this kind of wedding.

92
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:24,700
Rym: you either spend a lot of money to have it like in New York where we all live and Do the bare minimum or you spend that same amount of money.

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,470
Rym: do it somewhere cheap upstate and for that amount of money you?

94
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,776
Rym: Can do ridiculous shit.

95
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:31,890
Scott: so they skimped on the venue and spent the money on the fireworks.

96
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,781
Scott: They skimped on the food and spent the money on the fire.

97
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:45,719
Rym: so the fireworks were Right there like they were so clever that time in a wildwood when a few mortars fell into the crowd Mm-hmm and like exploded all around us man.

98
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,322
Scott: It happens a lot.

99
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:53,490
Rym: It was a show that was Directly over our heads, but was super professional timed well like choreographed.

100
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:56,890
Rym: Well the finale was good, and it was really long.

101
00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:04,909
Rym: But they were so close that you could see all the fireworks in 3d and all the debris was just like raining down on Top of us the whole time sounds dangerous.

102
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,157
Rym: It was professionals doing it.

103
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,070
Rym: It was as close as you can be to fireworks where it's still reasonably safe.

104
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,819
Rym: That was a fucking fireworks show.

105
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,910
Scott: mm-hmm wonder how much it cost.

106
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:20,510
Rym: I don't know, but I imagine that had the wedding men in New York City there would have been no fireworks.

107
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:22,330
Rym: Of course the fuck.

108
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:28,369
Rym: You get a permit for that shit, so I heard that you don't have any news today.

109
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:30,577
Scott: There's not a lot of news going on.

110
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,083
Rym: There's a lot of news going on.

111
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:33,570
Rym: holding a giant wildfire.

112
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,076
Scott: Yeah, what do we say about it?

113
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,341
Scott: There's a wildfire in California.

114
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:36,924
Scott: Don't live there.

115
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,470
Rym: How did you not see the sarcophagi?

116
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:40,944
Scott: I didn't see that or the hidden chamber.

117
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:41,950
Rym: They found in the Great Pyramid.

118
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,794
Rym: That's not news.

119
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:48,101
Scott: yet like I said before the show if you find a hidden chamber It's not news until we know what's in the hidden chamber.

120
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:49,790
Scott: Just like I have Al Capone's vault.

121
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,857
Scott: That's not news now.

122
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,426
Scott: It was Al Capone's vault is empty.

123
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:53,070
Scott: That's news.

124
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:57,330
Rym: It was news that they found that door in the Great Pyramid But there was news again when they opened the door.

125
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,603
Rym: It's not news until you open the door now because finding the door is news.

126
00:08:00,703 --> 00:08:05,110
Scott: it could be a mean it could be a worthless door And then it was hype up for nothing, but there's still a door.

127
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:12,385
Rym: I was obsessed with that fucking door like my entire childhood because there was no info on what was behind that door And I just assumed I cared about the robot.

128
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,975
Scott: I didn't care about the door I cared about.

129
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:16,289
Rym: I was mad like why can't the robot just open the door?

130
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:17,310
Scott: That's what I said.

131
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,197
Rym: I cared about the robot.

132
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:24,040
Rym: Later they did find like robots who could like look behind the door And there was like stuff back there and actually there's like the.

133
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:29,481
Rym: the Great Pyramid still has many mysteries sure But anyway, I got a few news as we can talk about.

134
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:31,730
Rym: so there's actually something happening.

135
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,958
Rym: That's kind of a big deal, and you probably wouldn't even notice.

136
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:42,238
Rym: This is happening unless you go to Smaller movie theaters that show old movies.

137
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:43,181
Scott: Oh, I read the story.

138
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:44,044
Rym: Yeah, okay.

139
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:45,068
Rym: This is real bad.

140
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:53,690
Scott: so basically The Disney bought Fox a while ago Yep, and which means among other things for example the Disney streaming service is gonna have every Simpsons ever.

141
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:55,337
Scott: Yep, right because that's Fox.

142
00:08:55,678 --> 00:09:07,050
Scott: you know a lot of things are Fox 20th century Fox You know like the thing that used to be like old movies like Raising, Arizona The thing that fly the thing that used to be at the start of Star Wars movies is not there anymore.

143
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,084
Scott: Yeah, right Disney bought Star Wars and Lucas, and now they bought the other part.

144
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:15,742
Scott: yep, so Basically which by the way they wouldn't have been allowed to do.

145
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:17,570
Scott: if there are any sort of antitrust anything.

146
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:19,850
Rym: Yeah, Disney should be broken up like 100%.

147
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,830
Rym: That's the moral of the story is way too big.

148
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:31,143
Rym: It was way too big a long time ago, and it just been accelerating its bigness way too much, but yeah I think Disney should have been broken up in the 80s, but I digress.

149
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:37,526
Rym: yeah, probably so Disney did a thing in the past called the vault which a lot of younger people don't really realize.

150
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:38,751
Scott: so what happened in the olden Days?

151
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,380
Scott: I'll explain the vault right is?

152
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:42,010
Scott: you didn't have your Netflixes.

153
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,229
Scott: You didn't have your pie digital internet piracy didn't have any internet, right?

154
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,060
Rym: If you're lucky you want a VHS tape.

155
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:56,366
Scott: so if you want to see a Disney movie Right it either has to be a. you're really lucky And it's getting on TV And you can record it like my grandma recorded Dumbo off TV so I can watch it over and over.

156
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:59,341
Scott: right B You bought a VHS at the store.

157
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:08,510
Scott: right C You saw the newest Disney movie in the theater But you ain't seen any old Disney movies in the theater only the newest newest one right and that was it.

158
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,035
Scott: That was the only way to see a Disney movie.

159
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:10,959
Scott: were those three ways.

160
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:13,689
Scott: and what they would do is those VHS.

161
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:13,990
Scott: is that you?

162
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:14,734
Scott: Could buy?

163
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:17,089
Scott: they would only be like they'd be like all right.

164
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:20,122
Scott: You know Aladdin was out came out like last.

165
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:21,668
Scott: you know last year a few months ago.

166
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,796
Scott: now Here's the first Aladdin VHS.

167
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,398
Scott: it's right.

168
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:25,260
Scott: and then what?

169
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:29,636
Scott: and then after like some months like you know what we're done Selling Aladdin on VHS.

170
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:30,841
Scott: it's going in the vault.

171
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:35,880
Scott: and now if you didn't buy Aladdin on VHS And you had the chance you got to wait until they decide.

172
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,510
Scott: you know what we're gonna put Aladdin on VHS out again.

173
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:45,050
Rym: It would make the news when Disney would be like hey little mermaids gonna be back in stores, right?

174
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,754
Scott: It's like you couldn't?

175
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:53,250
Scott: you went to the store to the Disney VHS even DVD section I don't know how long it went on for and you wanted to buy Lion King, and it just wasn't fucking there.

176
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,799
Scott: All right, you can maybe get a used one from someone.

177
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,890
Scott: you could maybe rent one at a blockbuster cuz they would keep them You know and especially if you went to a non blockbuster like a small local store.

178
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:10,430
Scott: Yeah Right they got everything when they were Available and they have the whole lineup because they bought them when they could right and then they rent them out.

179
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:12,389
Scott: So you could always watch them that way.

180
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:17,410
Scott: But if you wanted to buy one you had to buy they would cycle them right out of the vault.

181
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:23,029
Rym: well, so now so that the vault like wasn't as much of a thing anymore partly because Netflix Netflix.

182
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:26,920
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's not being meaningful.

183
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:31,010
Rym: so that what's happening now is there's a secondary thing going on.

184
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:40,470
Rym: There's a whole bunch of movie theaters that do things like hey on Halloween Let's show the movie Halloween or let's show the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

185
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:41,314
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's.

186
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:44,669
Scott: you know movie theaters are not getting too many people to come unless it's.

187
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:51,345
Scott: you know There's mega Marvel movies and shit then filled with in Star Wars and people fill the theater by the way All of those are owned by Disney.

188
00:11:51,405 --> 00:12:00,874
Scott: Yeah So all these other movies that aren't these, you know It's like less people are going to the theater for the not top tier mega blockbusters.

189
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:04,410
Scott: so movie theaters who want to fill their seats are doing all sorts of things like.

190
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,910
Scott: You know the fathom event stuff really went from being small to being like a huge thing.

191
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,441
Rym: Yeah, right like Nighthawk near us This has like brunch and booze and stuff.

192
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:17,019
Scott: and I show like old movies like Even theaters out in the burbs not in the cities.

193
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,382
Scott: are you know showing?

194
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,190
Scott: you know, not movies that are current run movies.

195
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,318
Scott: They're showing old movies.

196
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:23,989
Scott: They're showing special events.

197
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:32,450
Scott: They're showing like concerts being streamed from wherever the concert is happening live You know, they're showing all kinds of crazy stuff to get people to come in including old movies.

198
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,683
Rym: Yeah And these are old movies that otherwise are making zero dollars like.

199
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:39,158
Rym: it's just free money for Disney Free money for like the theater.

200
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:44,626
Scott: It's some movie that is, you know, maybe it's available on DVD somewhere But they're not like printing them and selling them like hotcakes.

201
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:56,008
Scott: Yeah But like they have the tape might be straight might be streaming on a service who knows it might be available to buy on You know for like a few dollars in iTunes or Amazon or YouTube or something, right?

202
00:12:56,931 --> 00:13:01,486
Scott: But it's not a movie that like, you know is being marketed currently.

203
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:02,910
Scott: It's just part of the library.

204
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:05,118
Scott: It's just in a bundle somewhere whatever.

205
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:13,417
Rym: but these small theaters because it's so cheap to get these movies That's how they kind of make their money to be able to also show Even more independent stuff.

206
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:16,228
Rym: that gets the smaller audience while still being profitable, right?

207
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:17,876
Scott: It's like hey No one's gonna come to see.

208
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,209
Scott: you know, we got we got ten screens in here.

209
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,569
Scott: Let's just show fucking Ghostbusters tonight.

210
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:27,227
Scott: Some Nostalgic people will come more than will come for whatever else the fuck we could put on there.

211
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:28,030
Rym: and that's a point.

212
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,675
Rym: So increase.

213
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:37,975
Scott: it's gonna cost us what like, you know If you got to pay the Ghostbusters people a few dollars to get the tape for the real or with the digital whatever because you Don't have film projectors anymore, right?

214
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:38,918
Scott: So you pay them.

215
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,130
Scott: they send us the thing we screen the movie we send it back.

216
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,916
Scott: It's that's how it works, right?

217
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:48,033
Rym: Yep, and these old movie screenings to actually draw a lot of people Yeah, like.

218
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,410
Rym: I would rather go see a lot of old movies than a lot of like first-run movies.

219
00:13:52,073 --> 00:14:01,370
Scott: You know people wouldn't be running these things in the theaters if people don't know him Like I go see commando in the theater diehard, especially people do like, you know, they'll do like special things.

220
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,836
Scott: You know, they'll mix it up a little.

221
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:05,689
Rym: show home alone and home alone - right?

222
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:09,810
Scott: Or hey the one of the actors in this movie lives in the area.

223
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:18,630
Scott: Let's have him come and talk before after the movie or you know Hey, we're gonna watch these silly movies and provide everyone with you know, some accoutrement.

224
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:21,810
Scott: Maybe you know some Rocky horror esque experience.

225
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,482
Scott: Yeah, you know size things up bit by bit.

226
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:29,903
Rym: a bunch of theaters notice This is everything just recently that all these Fox movies.

227
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:32,909
Rym: suddenly when they say hey, we'd like to get this film They're told it's not available.

228
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:35,780
Rym: Disney's basically not letting anyone get these movies anymore.

229
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:37,305
Rym: They're not letting anyone show them.

230
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:38,630
Rym: They're going back in the vault.

231
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:41,783
Scott: Yeah, anyone who's like, hey, I'd really like to show this Fox movie.

232
00:14:41,803 --> 00:14:42,124
Scott: Send me.

233
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:42,767
Scott: Here's some money.

234
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:43,410
Scott: Send me the thing.

235
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:46,569
Scott: It's just like nope now show something else.

236
00:14:46,731 --> 00:15:02,770
Rym: You can read this article again in the details but the suspected reason for this is Disney's always had this really fucked up strategy of they want to control a huge percentage of the number of screens in theaters Even if there no one goes to these those movies because they don't want other people's property to be in those.

237
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,794
Scott: This is their property.

238
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:06,202
Rym: Yes, but it's not their a-plus property.

239
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,470
Rym: They wonder what property is.

240
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:16,338
Rym: They want the property that they are currently making and pushing to fill the theaters Screens even if no one sees them.

241
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,544
Rym: Yeah, I don't understand that logic.

242
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:18,348
Scott: that makes no sense.

243
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:28,452
Rym: common sense I mean, I don't want to like derail the whole show and get into it but I've read a few articles about it and there's a whole bunch of kind of good in fact by Capitalism.

244
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:30,039
Rym: they do better by doing that.

245
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,993
Scott: Yeah, maybe I don't know but the point is by saying no You can't show the Fox thing.

246
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,820
Scott: So they'll just go to the remaining movie studio.

247
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:39,227
Scott: That's not Disney and show something else old.

248
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:42,390
Scott: Ah They're not gonna show a Disney thing.

249
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:44,476
Rym: I don't think you understand what you meaning.

250
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:45,700
Rym: the listener not Scott.

251
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:49,130
Rym: how many old movies Disney owns now?

252
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,708
Scott: Oh, yeah, they do but there are still plenty that they don't.

253
00:15:52,050 --> 00:16:02,604
Scott: Yeah, but if you're if you're a movie theater and they say no, you can't have the Fox movie I'm just gonna find fucking something else that someone will let me I'm actually gonna read a paragraph from this article because I this is.

254
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:03,690
Rym: this is a vulture article.

255
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:16,684
Rym: More than one exhibition professional contacted for this article Speculated that Disney's overall goal is to claim as many screens at a theater as possible for its newer titles Even if some of them are packing the house and others are selling just a handful of tickets.

256
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:28,749
Rym: a former theater manager for a major Chain who asked not to be identified for this piece said it seems short-sighted, you know, but they do it I think just to keep Sony out To keep a universal out.

257
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:35,589
Scott: But this is a person who is the person who's in charge of deciding what to show who they're interviewing and that person knows this.

258
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:40,010
Scott: So wouldn't that person then get a sony and universal thing?

259
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:43,642
Scott: Hey, it's like they're in charge of what goes on the screens.

260
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:48,221
Scott: Disney doesn't own the movie theater directly Which you wonder why they don't and that would be odd.

261
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,889
Rym: So there was a lot of speculations.

262
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:51,981
Scott: Disney Just buy like regal and AMC or whatever.

263
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:52,464
Scott: It is now.

264
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:56,294
Rym: There was a lot of Theaters did merge.

265
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:57,800
Rym: Disney used to go after the theaters.

266
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,426
Rym: Disney wanted to like own the theaters.

267
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:00,149
Rym: Disney like.

268
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:00,510
Rym: look at that.

269
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:08,670
Rym: Remember all the shitstorm around the rules Disney put in place to allow a theater to show Star Wars Disney's play in Monopoly hardball here.

270
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,890
Scott: Then the point is, you know, obviously that's even worse Monopoly if they do own the theater.

271
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,602
Scott: But it's like why not just fucking buy the theater?

272
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:16,589
Scott: then no one can show us anything.

273
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,782
Scott: I think here's the person who decides what goes on a screen in the theater.

274
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,930
Scott: knows Disney's trying to lock up all the screens.

275
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:26,440
Scott: Can't that person intentionally just show Sony Universal things?

276
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:32,883
Scott: Yeah, they can and be like, hey Disney Let me show the Fox stuff or else I'm gonna show Sony Universal instead.

277
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:33,225
Scott: Fuck you.

278
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:34,530
Scott: In fact, you're brand new movie.

279
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,302
Scott: I won't even show that.

280
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:35,708
Rym: fuck you.

281
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:38,609
Rym: The problem is theaters don't make money.

282
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:40,780
Rym: No theaters are like that.

283
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,247
Rym: whole industry is on the verge of collapse.

284
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:46,890
Scott: as far as I can Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, I could I feel like I could run a theater and make money.

285
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,970
Scott: I would just be good to be very clever and creative and you know, yeah be in a good location.

286
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:53,190
Rym: Well, yeah, it's definitely being a good location.

287
00:17:53,190 --> 00:18:00,090
Rym: There's definitely a divide like urban feet like theaters in cities are a completely different world from theaters and suburbs.

288
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,119
Scott: Yeah, we can show promare and fill the house.

289
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,530
Scott: Yeah subtitles in a story.

290
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:12,590
Scott: Right, if you show promare with subtitles in you know a suburb you're getting the 10 anime nerds at the high school.

291
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:13,719
Scott: Yep, and that's it.

292
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,049
Scott: You're not filling the whole place.

293
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,719
Rym: So in some other news that is accurate, there's a lot of shitty news today But there's some really good news.

294
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:22,929
Rym: if you're not aware Polio is still around.

295
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:28,946
Scott: Yeah That's why you still get a polio vaccine and you don't get a smallpox vaccine because smallpox is not still around.

296
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:37,248
Rym: the only reason Smallpox is gone and polio is mostly gone is because of the massive vaccination effort that continues to happen.

297
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:42,350
Rym: Mm-hmm The world is actively trying to eradicate polio completely.

298
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:48,190
Scott: Yeah, we mean it's mostly eradicated in a lot of the world where people have access to vaccines.

299
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:55,602
Scott: But in a lot of the poor parts of the world where people don't have access to vaccines in great health care There's still quite a bit of polio going around.

300
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:57,150
Rym: There are multiple strains of polio.

301
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,983
Rym: One of them I think was completely eradicated a long time ago.

302
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:05,701
Rym: Yeah, uh Just now Another strain was completely eliminated.

303
00:19:05,781 --> 00:19:07,467
Scott: How do you know?

304
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:08,470
Scott: How do they measure that?

305
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:13,143
Scott: It's like that person had it and they they died and now no one else has it.

306
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:15,350
Scott: anybody anybody have the second polio.

307
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:16,939
Rym: So it comes down to you.

308
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,131
Scott: You got polio 3 anyone got polio 2.

309
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:28,557
Rym: I'm sure some people are gonna jump on me for being slightly wrong about this but as far as I'm aware the way that works is based on statistical analysis of Based on all the research.

310
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,184
Scott: No one's gotten this in X years.

311
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:34,450
Scott: Yeah, we're calling it So like we sort of like the elections are like like we're calling it.

312
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:43,494
Rym: There's enough votes in research sampling and testing and reporting cases have an X percent chance of detecting any given type of illness But we have data on that.

313
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:48,610
Rym: So that percentage coupled with how long it's been since one was reported, right?

314
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:58,788
Scott: So it's been a super long time since we've found any case of this and we Yeah, so that means it must be gone because no one's gotten it.

315
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,487
Rym: Yep, and Pakistan is one of only two countries in the world where polio was still endemic.

316
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:06,510
Rym: So, okay We're in like the final stage of the country.

317
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:12,050
Scott: I don't know what do we even have data on that though for like the really bad countries like Eritrea or North Korea?

318
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:17,890
Rym: They're they're part of the UN and a whole bunch of multinational organizations work really hard to make sure that data is accurate.

319
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:24,650
Scott: I'm just saying, you know, it's like you'd think that like the worst a country is like Pakistan's not the greatest country, right?

320
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,790
Scott: They got issues, but like Eritrea is like the worst country, right?

321
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,570
Scott: It's hard to imagine that that Pakistan would have polio and Eritrea.

322
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:44,224
Rym: It's complicated because countries that have lower economic activity also have less like travel and You can see how this gets really complicated in a hurry.

323
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:59,461
Rym: So the perfect storm For misery the perfect store for human misery is a country that is growing rapidly modernizing has a growing economy But still has Yeah, yeah, okay makes sense.

324
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,329
Rym: So now some bad news.

325
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:03,754
Rym: Just another.

326
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:07,130
Rym: you know, I cannot stress this enough and I'm not gonna dwell on this too long.

327
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:13,950
Rym: You're like million details But the United States is in the middle of a literal crisis and might fail as a country and you really should be.

328
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:15,836
Scott: That's not news.

329
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:17,161
Scott: That's been true for several years.

330
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:19,935
Rym: Yep, and you'd think every week What does that?

331
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:22,450
Rym: how could this week be that much worse than last week?

332
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,764
Scott: This news is really just like a stunt.

333
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,810
Scott: It's not really a big deal.

334
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:28,120
Rym: It's a stunt except for the fact that it's done.

335
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:34,159
Rym: basically a whole bunch of American Republican Congressman did something that is like literally illegal.

336
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,164
Rym: Yep, and they're not being punished for it.

337
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:40,710
Rym: They broke into a secure compartmentalized information.

338
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:44,187
Rym: Whatever the skiff for the sift depending on what part.

339
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:47,262
Scott: intelligence community Yeah, but anyway the point it yeah people don't know.

340
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:57,785
Scott: but basically, you know When you're in the government and you have a security clearance, right and you gotta have a meeting and the meeting involves You know some security detailed stuff that not everyone can listen to.

341
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:03,309
Scott: you got to be sure That when you talk about it that you're only talking about it with people who are you know?

342
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,293
Scott: Are allowed to know.

343
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:08,710
Scott: and you got to be sure they say there's no bugs bugging you right from other countries spying.

344
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,003
Scott: Yeah, you got to make sure that you know Nobody's bringing like their phone in there to take photos of documents.

345
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:15,670
Scott: Just email the documents away.

346
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,558
Scott: No, right, you got him, you know, there's some certain rules, right.

347
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,210
Scott: so they have these rooms ranging from small to large.

348
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:32,350
Rym: Right like Obama had a tent that he'd bring around that he could set up in hotel rooms if there is an emergency And he needed to like look at and interact with secure information, right?

349
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,618
Scott: He would you know, they set up the tent.

350
00:22:33,638 --> 00:22:34,986
Scott: he goes inside he looks at the stuff.

351
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,338
Scott: everyone else He's not allowed to see it stays outside the tent.

352
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:42,281
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, it's like, you know and these rooms They have people who are trusted people.

353
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:55,199
Scott: I assume they have some really intelligent system Where they make sure that there aren't any bugs in the room, yep, like Yeah, and it's like when you go in the room you got to leave your phone outside You got to leave all the shit outside.

354
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,244
Scott: They search your ass.

355
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:57,270
Scott: You can't just walk in there.

356
00:22:58,473 --> 00:23:00,187
Rym: Cuz like a lot of military people go to the microphone.

357
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:09,237
Rym: What an officer would tell anyone who's gonna go to one for the first time is if you fucking forget your cell phone and it's In your pocket and it enters that room.

358
00:23:09,578 --> 00:23:12,148
Rym: It's the government's cell phone now and that's gonna suck right.

359
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:24,490
Scott: and you know There's even it's even a lower level of government like even in like your local government like say I don't know like like a DA or a US Attorney or someone like that.

360
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:29,403
Scott: We'll have one of these because they have to look at like Documents that are sealed and no one else in the office can see them.

361
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:32,889
Scott: right stuff like that Maybe like some grand jury type stuff.

362
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:43,695
Rym: There's all kinds of secret documents all over the place and there's different levels of secure things But this is basically the secure room in the basement of Congress for some of the most Congress.

363
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:51,763
Scott: they have one of these because you might need to have say a committee interrogate somebody About secret shit and the Congress people obviously are allowed to know.

364
00:23:51,783 --> 00:24:00,530
Rym: not all the Congress people No, not all of them But the people on say the security committee and considering like half our Congress people are basically foreign assets at this point, right?

365
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:04,110
Scott: Or you know the you know judicial committee or whatever, right?

366
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:08,730
Scott: Sometimes they got to have you know committee meetings and they got an interview.

367
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:13,950
Scott: Maybe they got to bring in some top secret military dude and interview him right about top secret shit.

368
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,710
Scott: Maybe some CIA people got to come in and testify to Congress about top secret shit.

369
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:21,245
Scott: They have a whole big-ass room that they can have a committee meeting in.

370
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:22,309
Scott: that's you know.

371
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:23,334
Scott: Lock the door.

372
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:26,046
Scott: everyone leaves their phone outside the room right in a bag.

373
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:26,949
Scott: It's a big phone pile.

374
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:29,763
Scott: Yeah, there's and this little guy stands with a guard of the sack.

375
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:31,170
Rym: There's like little lockers and things.

376
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:33,360
Scott: I'm sure they got it handled right?

377
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:37,810
Scott: But anyway, you know the They had a meeting of this nature.

378
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:40,776
Scott: Yeah And there are public answer in the meeting.

379
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:46,010
Scott: legit because it's a committee meeting and all the committees are split like 51 49.

380
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,754
Scott: Yep, regardless of how many elected people there are which is I think a problem Topic for another day.

381
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:56,850
Rym: Well, it wasn't a problem until the Republicans under when Obama was president.

382
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,030
Scott: No, but I'm saying is like if you're I don't want to go on with this about an hour.

383
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,485
Scott: Pretend party a took 80% of Congress.

384
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:10,050
Scott: Oh, yeah, maybe they should have 80% of the committee seats on each committee and not 51 49.

385
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:15,428
Rym: Yeah, the thing is doesn't matter because the committee conveys that the committee will do whatever the majority party wants.

386
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:16,070
Scott: obviously.

387
00:25:16,211 --> 00:25:19,649
Scott: But like what if we elected 10 people from some third party?

388
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:25,704
Scott: to Congress right I'm just saying.

389
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,616
Scott: I'm just saying How many seats on the committee's?

390
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:30,957
Rym: what?

391
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:32,321
Rym: what if a unicorn got?

392
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:35,330
Scott: like how many committee seats would kudos get on which committees?

393
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:40,622
Scott: Even if they got like 20 people they will get zero right exactly.

394
00:25:40,662 --> 00:25:41,665
Scott: So I think that's a problem.

395
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:46,330
Rym: But anyway, regardless I Know out they should make them a hundred percent Democrat.

396
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:51,210
Scott: There were Republicans they should and there were Republicans and Democrats in the committee meeting as is normal.

397
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:54,449
Scott: And then the Republicans pulled a stunt where they like busted into the room.

398
00:25:54,911 --> 00:25:57,881
Scott: Physically, I guess the guards didn't stop them.

399
00:25:58,263 --> 00:25:59,808
Scott: I don't know why I don't.

400
00:25:59,928 --> 00:26:04,670
Scott: I think that I feel like if you try to bust into that room you get shot right regardless of who you are.

401
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:07,569
Scott: So from what I like if I tried to bust into the room, what would happen?

402
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,424
Scott: What if I was black and I tried to bust into the room?

403
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:11,450
Rym: I would happen.

404
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,442
Rym: I think at best you'd get tackled right right.

405
00:26:15,602 --> 00:26:17,187
Rym: It don't tease me bro might happen.

406
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:18,270
Scott: It wouldn't be a good result.

407
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,354
Scott: So they got in the room.

408
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:21,363
Rym: Why didn't the sergeant of arms hit him with that mace?

409
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,110
Scott: the mace isn't over in that area.

410
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:27,622
Rym: I want to see Nancy Pelosi like texting him like get the mace.

411
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:29,630
Scott: the mace doesn't get the mace.

412
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:30,232
Rym: We need it.

413
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:32,503
Rym: bring the mace to the basement as soon as possible.

414
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:33,849
Scott: You're not good enough for the mace.

415
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:38,330
Rym: Well get you at the butt end of the mace not the top part with the wings.

416
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:38,934
Scott: I mean the.

417
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:41,350
Scott: the wing end is probably the one you don't want to hit someone with.

418
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:43,478
Scott: Mess up the one you'll mess up the bird.

419
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:45,849
Rym: Yeah, you mess up the bird and the person one hit with the other end.

420
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:57,839
Rym: so basically one of our political parties a bunch of their members broke a whole bunch of laws and No one knows what's gonna happen now like now I'm sure that room is gonna have to be like swept.

421
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:10,842
Rym: and the best part was they all a bunch of them tweeted while they were in this fucking room and then in this like hilarious display that That actually is interesting because the door was still open.

422
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:12,890
Rym: Oh the door was like that point.

423
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,278
Scott: I was like, how could you tweet from the room?

424
00:27:14,358 --> 00:27:15,666
Scott: That shows the rooms got a problem.

425
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,295
Rym: if the door was closed I don't think you could tweet.

426
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,863
Rym: Okay, pretty sure it's a Faraday cage.

427
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:20,149
Rym: Okay, just check it.

428
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:27,176
Rym: So you saw a whole bunch of them tweeted from the room and then like ten minutes later They all started tweeting.

429
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:30,629
Rym: things like by the way that last tweet was sent by a staffer outside the room.

430
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:32,316
Rym: Try to cover their asses.

431
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:32,878
Scott: Uh-huh.

432
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,027
Scott: So we can just see who tweeted.

433
00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:40,199
Rym: Yeah Frankly they should all be jailed and removed from Congress.

434
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:40,681
Rym: Yeah.

435
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:41,905
Scott: Yeah, I mean or at least jailed.

436
00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:46,137
Scott: Yeah, I mean Do it by a video.

437
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:46,940
Scott: well, no, you can't.

438
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:47,483
Scott: it's like.

439
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:49,170
Scott: well you got to show up to cast your vote.

440
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,601
Scott: Yeah, you're in jail.

441
00:27:50,621 --> 00:27:52,696
Rym: It's Problem sucks for you.

442
00:27:52,716 --> 00:28:02,376
Rym: I guess you won't be voting things of the day.

443
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:09,470
Rym: so this made it past my feed and Like I saw it and I got it was a funny little joke and I noticed two things.

444
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:15,502
Rym: I noticed that one most people who saw this tweet did not get it Because I think most people can't actually read music at all.

445
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:17,010
Scott: Oh, I saw this.

446
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,570
Rym: Yeah, so it's just someone just posted something They're like, I never had such a face after sight reading something in my head alone, right?

447
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,413
Scott: Cuz it's like it's it.

448
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:26,927
Scott: the lyrics are Mary had a little lamb, but little lamb are all the same.

449
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:27,690
Scott: note one, two, three.

450
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:30,157
Scott: Yeah, and here it's like it's three different.

451
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:31,741
Scott: Oh, it's it's up down up.

452
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:34,067
Scott: It's like Mary had a little.

453
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:34,910
Scott: it's like it's wrong.

454
00:28:35,236 --> 00:28:44,099
Scott: Yeah, right Even if you don't have perfect pitch if you just know how to read music and you know that notes that are vertically higher are Higher and music notes that are lower or lower.

455
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,330
Scott: You can see that these notes do not line up with these lyrics.

456
00:28:47,631 --> 00:28:50,039
Rym: So I see all these people like not getting it.

457
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:56,401
Rym: but the joke was pretty good and I laughed out loud, uh Basically, I'll just ruin it.

458
00:28:58,451 --> 00:28:59,495
Scott: It's so it's super wrong.

459
00:28:59,696 --> 00:28:59,957
Scott: Yeah.

460
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:01,444
Rym: Well, do you know what that song is?

461
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:02,790
Rym: Oh it is.

462
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,021
Scott: Oh, they took a different song and put Mary had a little bit.

463
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:08,550
Rym: So if you do you read the notes and sing the.

464
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,818
Rym: It's the Hall of the Mountain.

465
00:29:14,858 --> 00:29:17,130
Scott: I can now see that it is the Hall of the Mountain King.

466
00:29:17,552 --> 00:29:19,119
Scott: I didn't realize it was another song.

467
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,846
Scott: as soon as you told me that I could tell what song.

468
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:21,670
Rym: Yeah, I looked at it.

469
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:22,904
Rym: I was like, oh, it's the wrong note.

470
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:24,454
Rym: Oh God damn it.

471
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:35,355
Rym: And now every time I hear all of the Mountain King, I'm thinking Mary had a little lamb So the other I can read music.

472
00:29:35,455 --> 00:29:39,109
Scott: Yeah, I just couldn't play that on an instrument unless I went and practiced again.

473
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:40,515
Rym: So even better.

474
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:51,011
Rym: you can read the thread on this tweet of half the people getting it Not getting it and a bunch of people posting even more obtuse music Right.

475
00:29:51,031 --> 00:30:01,945
Scott: So you keep posting this one and I keep thinking that like maybe it's a fucking all-star This one this one's not all-star right or is it lost?

476
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:02,890
Rym: people keep thinking this one.

477
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,473
Scott: I thought it was.

478
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:05,582
Scott: I thought it was like a four note all-star cuz.

479
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:07,028
Scott: you can see how I could think that cuz like.

480
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:11,048
Scott: yeah Cuz it'd be like, you know, it was the star is like some body, right?

481
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:13,130
Scott: Yeah It's like.

482
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,323
Scott: I thought it was woody woodpecker because it looks like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

483
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,230
Rym: I realize I for whatever reason I got this right away.

484
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:21,712
Scott: What is it?

485
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:22,898
Scott: It's a doo-doo-doo-doo.

486
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:23,180
Rym: Nope.

487
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,250
Rym: It's doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, which you're close.

488
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:29,770
Scott: I was close, but what it is is it's the dots the diamonds the dots.

489
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:32,198
Scott: Yeah, I forgot how to read the dots until just now.

490
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:35,670
Rym: very opening bit to the undertale megalovania fight song.

491
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,995
Scott: Oh, that's of course why I wouldn't know.

492
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:43,758
Rym: it is not something I know but if you look at undertale people like undertale community People they this is not.

493
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:46,830
Scott: I thought I would be mad if it was something I knew but there's no way I could get that.

494
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,386
Rym: So this has been a meme for a long time like since undertale came out of.

495
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:54,658
Rym: people will post this in Reaction to something that they're incensed about.

496
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,108
Scott: you should make one that says so that's I guess.

497
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:00,699
Rym: I guess That's wrong on purpose to make all right.

498
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:09,209
Scott: Well the notes for somebody would be like right, so be a half note and then like yeah, right and then I guess put and then put a different lyric on it.

499
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:13,201
Scott: or To take this and write somebody under it.

500
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:15,007
Scott: Yeah, right something like that.

501
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:16,030
Rym: or is this loss?

502
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:19,317
Rym: Everyone thinks this is lost when I post it.

503
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:20,261
Rym: It's not lost.

504
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,425
Rym: No, it's did it.

505
00:31:21,485 --> 00:31:22,790
Rym: it did it did it.

506
00:31:23,535 --> 00:31:25,690
Rym: Yeah, I even made it my form avatar.

507
00:31:26,694 --> 00:31:27,745
Scott: So what do you got?

508
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:28,150
Scott: what do I have?

509
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,270
Scott: Oh, so when I was a kid back in the day you get on a school bus every morning.

510
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:37,170
Scott: Yeah, and in kindergarten, I got on the school bus and that was Ralph the bus driver.

511
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,737
Scott: Right who route?

512
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:40,384
Scott: the bus driver was awesome, right?

513
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:41,830
Scott: I kept seeing him for many moons.

514
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:47,980
Rym: I wonder why Ralph is right now awesome bus drive kindergarten Why I got driven to school or I walked to school.

515
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,370
Scott: I took the school bus for a very long time.

516
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,030
Rym: Anyway, the point is I basically never took school buses except in middle school because many.

517
00:31:54,571 --> 00:32:01,110
Scott: So on the school bus, they would always play hot 97, which you didn't know you're in Detroit.

518
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,890
Scott: 97 was a New York radio station.

519
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:24,649
Scott: It was broadcast from the top of the Empire State Building 97.1 and in the early 90s hot 97 switched From being sort of like, you know 80s early 90s dance music to being hip-hop Right, and it was good in both forms, right, but they changed genre right in in the early 90s.

520
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:29,024
Scott: So the hip-hop hot 97 that's like man.

521
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:30,590
Scott: There was some good shit going on there.

522
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:31,053
Scott: it's like.

523
00:32:31,094 --> 00:32:34,555
Scott: it's like legendary right, but the point is here.

524
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:37,654
Scott: my thing of the day is I don't know how.

525
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:38,981
Scott: who say who rescued this.

526
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:39,966
Scott: I don't even know how they have it.

527
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:43,460
Rym: Haha, right Channel is like 600 subscribers, right?

528
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,527
Scott: Yeah, so before I'll subscribe.

529
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:48,074
Scott: Yeah, so Romanowski, that's right.

530
00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:54,210
Scott: before it switched away from dance music Jeff legendary DJ Jeff Romanowski.

531
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:58,450
Scott: Right, we put like these awesome, you know late 80s early 90s dance mixes.

532
00:32:59,334 --> 00:33:06,881
Scott: He even described this was one of my last shows right on Hot 97 and this is one of the lat.

533
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:11,137
Scott: there's actually more on this channel than just this one But this is one of the last ones.

534
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:16,843
Scott: he did on a Friday night before the genre of the station changed And I guess he lost his radio show.

535
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:20,336
Scott: it became a different show Right and you could listen to the whole show.

536
00:33:20,697 --> 00:33:25,670
Scott: and these awesome beats on YouTube hasn't been taken down for some reason?

537
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,055
Scott: Okay, I'll take advantage of it.

538
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,443
Rym: while it's there it's got some.

539
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,610
Rym: it's listing a bunch of songs that are in it.

540
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,806
Rym: I'm sure it's got some copyright thing going on where he's not making money from it.

541
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:36,429
Scott: Who knows?

542
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:44,190
Scott: But yeah, if you want to experience the early 90s, you know, New York late night awesome radio.

543
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:46,094
Scott: Here you go YouTube.

544
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:48,483
Rym: That's pretty cool in the meta moment.

545
00:33:48,503 --> 00:33:50,290
Rym: The GeekNights book club book is the tale of Genji.

546
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,090
Rym: It's gonna be a while.

547
00:33:51,170 --> 00:34:02,650
Rym: So we might read another short book in the interim and just idly read the tale of Genji over some time and talk about It occasionally as we work toward its stunning may have may have bitten off more than it's doable in one bite.

548
00:34:03,212 --> 00:34:08,570
Scott: Yeah, maybe maybe we can be like tale of Genji first half or something and then come back with second half.

549
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:09,784
Scott: I'm gonna we'll see.

550
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:10,208
Rym: We'll see.

551
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:17,801
Rym: Well, we might do some checkpoint like book club episodes along the way with the tale of Genji But in the area, we might pick a shorter book like in the works.

552
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,007
Rym: Maybe a short story or something.

553
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:24,429
Rym: Yeah something I'm gonna pick something cuz my choice would be next and we'll read it in the interim.

554
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:30,888
Rym: Otherwise, we're gonna be live at PAX Unplugged doing two things We'll link to them and everything when the schedule is fully up.

555
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:33,440
Rym: Paxis badges went on sale today.

556
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,589
Scott: Yep, as did Saturday sold out.

557
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:36,299
Rym: yet I'm gonna.

558
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:45,705
Rym: last year It took two hours for Saturday to sell out with the caveat that people were in line to buy that last badge Way before you actually saw that sell out.

559
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:51,433
Scott: Yes Saturday sold out but every other day Open.

560
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:59,170
Scott: because Oh four days available - oh, yeah Now that they brought back the four-day badge, by the way.

561
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:06,813
Scott: So even if Saturday's sold out if you want to go to all of paxis the easy to get a bad four-day badge There it is Not bad.

562
00:35:07,074 --> 00:35:08,480
Rym: All right, so we will be at PAX East.

563
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,970
Rym: also PAX South is coming up and also magfest.

564
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:12,070
Rym: We'll be at all these places.

565
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,739
Scott: So many people just want to go to PAX East for Saturday only.

566
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:17,910
Rym: in Russia most people only want to go to cons for one.

567
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:20,164
Rym: All right, that's like normal people.

568
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:21,050
Rym: they live in the city.

569
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:25,230
Rym: They go to the they go to the gaming con their kid gets the signature of the youtuber.

570
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,939
Rym: They like they walk around the expo hall.

571
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,830
Rym: They go to one panel and get the fuck out.

572
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,016
Rym: that's why it's so empty at night.

573
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:44,257
Rym: hmm, and especially paxis because Part of the reason why paxis doesn't sell out as fast as it used to is that now that it can accommodate a lot more People there are not enough hotels in Boston Like there just are not enough hotels.

574
00:35:44,618 --> 00:35:48,270
Rym: any hotel that's even remotely close to packs is already completely sold out.

575
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:55,210
Rym: So, uh, I think that is really put the damper on people buying like going multiple days.

576
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:56,632
Scott: No Anyway,

577
00:35:56,933 --> 00:36:09,226
Rym: cuz like imagine if I was gonna go to PAX West and like Saturday was sold out and I didn't have a way to Get a badge for Saturday I would not fly out to Seattle to go to a few days of packs and not be able to go on one of the Days, I just wouldn't go at all.

578
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:13,570
Rym: Cuz I'm not gonna fly all the way to Seattle unless I'm going for like the whole con.

579
00:36:13,812 --> 00:36:15,828
Rym: Yeah, I feel like paxis has a similar thing happening.

580
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:17,701
Rym: Anyway, so sleep.

581
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:19,555
Scott: Oh Main bit.

582
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:20,602
Rym: Yeah, let's get right into it.

583
00:36:20,622 --> 00:36:21,829
Rym: Can't believe you never talked about this.

584
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:25,969
Scott: Yeah, well, you know sleep is a hot topic because people don't get enough of it.

585
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:30,487
Rym: Yep, my late capitalism has ruined the world and nice you're rich.

586
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:34,970
Scott: even rich people I think aren't getting a lot of sleep because they're the kind of people who you know.

587
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,370
Scott: It's like they can't afford to sleep all they want but they're the kind of people don't on purpose.

588
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:42,802
Rym: Yep, it's kind of an aside But I promise you that Scott and I are not like this.

589
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:50,577
Rym: if I had enough money to where I could live a pretty good Life ever one of the things that I really I would never work again I would just make one of the reasons.

590
00:36:50,698 --> 00:36:51,902
Scott: I want a lot of money.

591
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:53,770
Scott: You know, I don't need an insane amount of money.

592
00:36:53,891 --> 00:36:55,669
Scott: I just need enough money to not have to go to work.

593
00:36:56,572 --> 00:37:01,354
Scott: I'm only that level of greedy because I want to be able to Every every single day.

594
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:08,596
Scott: I want to be able to just go to sleep when I'm tired and then wake up whenever my body wakes up With no alarm whatsoever.

595
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:11,370
Scott: That's that's that's like one of the top things I want in the world.

596
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:12,923
Scott: But no I have to.

597
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:19,170
Scott: you know I need to because I waste my whole day at an office doing bullshit looking at the bed screen.

598
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:23,750
Scott: I need to spend a certain number of hours awake at home taking care of biz.

599
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:30,649
Scott: Yeah I can't go to sleep as early as I would like and then I have to set an alarm so that I wake up on time To go to that stupid office again.

600
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:38,188
Rym: So let's go through history because actually I think about my life and all the different stages even from childhood I've never gotten enough sleep my entire life.

601
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,790
Rym: So in elementary school and well elementary school, I don't have that many memories.

602
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:46,689
Rym: But like I don't know when my parents sent me to bed I just I'd stay up until I went to bed.

603
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:57,170
Rym: But all what I do remember is that I stayed up way later than anyone I knew like all the kids at school be like, oh like bedtimes 8 o'clock and I was like, what the fuck bedtimes like 11?

604
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,216
Rym: What's wrong with your parents?

605
00:37:58,236 --> 00:38:13,410
Scott: I mean, yeah, I mean at a certain point in my life I definitely went to bed after pretty much everyone else in the house whether it was like I'm downstairs watching the hockey game until it's over and then everyone else is asleep and then I go to bed or Downstairs playing civilization 2 until everyone else is asleep.

606
00:38:13,555 --> 00:38:14,854
Scott: Yeah and then I go to bed.

607
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:22,447
Rym: high school was the best because my whole family would go to bed and I would be up until Like for like I'd be up until the Sun came up playing sieve - oh not that late.

608
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:24,662
Rym: No kind I was up until sunrise.

609
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:25,670
Rym: I stayed up all night.

610
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:34,850
Rym: I want to say once or twice a week in the summer when I was in high school like all night like I'd be up Summer I went to camp, you know, I didn't go to camp.

611
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:44,331
Rym: I was just I'd be playing sieve - or I'd be out biking and the Sun would come up and I'd go and get some breakfast Somewhere and then I'd come home and I'd go to bed and wake up again at like 1 p.m Like

612
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:45,438
Scott: even at summer camp, right?

613
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:47,229
Scott: It's like they make you go to bed.

614
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:50,701
Scott: It's like it'll be dinner then the night activity.

615
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:54,257
Scott: then you go back to your bung and then it's like, all right Now you got to go to bed.

616
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:55,569
Scott: You're not letting you do anything else.

617
00:38:56,532 --> 00:39:00,150
Scott: And then you had to wake up at a certain time because shit starting and you got to go, right?

618
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:05,167
Scott: And so even there it's like you got plenty of sleep because you know of the hours that they set.

619
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:06,818
Scott: but it's like you still Didn't get.

620
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:11,870
Scott: you know You were woken up in the morning by you know, often their dinner.

621
00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:13,475
Rym: It's funny.

622
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:21,729
Rym: Like I use the same alarm clock from Third grade until I left RIT and I even used it in Beacon for a long time.

623
00:39:22,432 --> 00:39:24,057
Rym: That sound to this day.

624
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:29,897
Rym: if I hear that sound I don't want to say I have a panic attack But I suddenly had this moment of oh shit.

625
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:30,580
Rym: Oh fuck.

626
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,463
Rym: I have to get up.

627
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:32,285
Rym: I have to wake up.

628
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:32,727
Rym: Fuck.

629
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:33,450
Rym: Goddamn it.

630
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:37,202
Rym: Like that sound is the worst sound on earth to my brain.

631
00:39:37,985 --> 00:39:39,490
Rym: And that's why I don't use that alarm clock anymore.

632
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:41,254
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it's like.

633
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:44,083
Scott: but even that considering that, you know, never really got.

634
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:49,593
Scott: I mean there are certain nights where I get You know, I'm able to do that but not many like on the weekend I can do.

635
00:39:50,237 --> 00:39:52,210
Rym: this was and there's recent stories about this.

636
00:39:52,230 --> 00:40:01,510
Rym: That's why I thought of this episode because studies have been showing forever That kids don't get enough sleep and it actually makes them perform worse at school and like has all these problems.

637
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:07,770
Scott: I mean, I mean for everybody if you don't get enough sleep, there are several studies that show a it fucks up your digestion.

638
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,229
Scott: Yeah, it probably makes you live less long.

639
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:12,899
Scott: It makes your brain not as good.

640
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,134
Scott: pretty much everything is bad if you don't get enough sleep But specifically kids.

641
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:20,224
Rym: and it's began a big part of why kids don't get enough sleep.

642
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:22,170
Rym: Is that school starts in America?

643
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:24,358
Scott: The crack ass of dawn.

644
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:35,857
Rym: and it's been that way forever mostly because Americans like both parents often work and school has to start early enough for parents to get their kids together to go to school Before the parents go to work.

645
00:40:36,178 --> 00:40:39,347
Rym: So if work is at 9 then schools got to start at like 730, right?

646
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:46,509
Scott: I never understood that because we have no problem having school end at like 2 or 3 and then it's like you.

647
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,234
Rym: look at schools Always have latch key and shit.

648
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:54,858
Rym: some of them do but some like every school has that except well except schools in poor neighborhoods Because our society is fucked right?

649
00:40:54,878 --> 00:40:57,590
Scott: But I mean some people some often they charge for that, right?

650
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,624
Scott: You know, it's like, okay, you remember even in my

651
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:06,175
Rym: elementary school I think like half the kids just stayed at the school for like three extra hours until their parents came and picked him up After work,

652
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:09,723
Scott: I mean I would take the bus home No one would be there but I'd have a key and I went in the house

653
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:10,286
Rym: in Michigan.

654
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:10,870
Rym: That was illegal.

655
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:14,289
Rym: Okay, it was technically illegal for kids under a certain age to be home alone.

656
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,292
Scott: Interesting.

657
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:16,921
Rym: Yeah, a lot of states have laws like that.

658
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:18,570
Scott: We did not have that situation.

659
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,740
Rym: Yeah, you might have you just didn't give a shit.

660
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:24,516
Scott: But the point is is like when I was too young I couldn't do that, right?

661
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:30,398
Rym: Yeah, but my middle my middle school middle school I remember because it was burned in my brain.

662
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,650
Rym: My alarm was set for six twenty in the morning.

663
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:37,290
Rym: That's when I had to wake up to get to middle school on time.

664
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,153
Scott: I had to wake up that early.

665
00:41:38,173 --> 00:41:49,490
Rym: Like sixth grade seventh because it started at like 730 was my first class and Jazz band an optional class was in the magic zeroth period before the teachers got to get there even earlier.

666
00:41:49,831 --> 00:41:53,145
Rym: Yeah sucks for them once a week on Fridays.

667
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:58,329
Rym: I had to get up at 520 in the morning to be able to get to jazz band on time.

668
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:02,505
Rym: Yeah, so my five dad had like drive me to school every day at like 6 a.m.

669
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:08,830
Scott: You know, I feel like if you have kids the it should be regardless of whatever the school hours are.

670
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:11,990
Scott: It's like your work is just should have to just fucking deal with it.

671
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:17,532
Scott: Yeah, come to work when you're you know, after you take your kids to school whenever the hell that is You know what?

672
00:42:17,552 --> 00:42:17,893
Scott: That's what nice.

673
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:21,067
Scott: and then you leave work when it's time to pick your kids up.

674
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:21,870
Scott: Fuck you work.

675
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:23,444
Scott: You're the one who has to deal with.

676
00:42:23,464 --> 00:42:27,788
Rym: you know What one of the benefits of working for the place I work for is that they're kind of just like that.

677
00:42:27,828 --> 00:42:33,774
Rym: like a lot Of people their schedules are just weird because they do stuff with their kids based on like school schedules and things Like.

678
00:42:33,814 --> 00:42:34,719
Rym: no one has a problem with that.

679
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:35,342
Rym: It just happens.

680
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:36,630
Rym: It's totally natural.

681
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:44,010
Rym: More jobs should be like that, but they're not yep, but in middle school like I'd stay up or whatever.

682
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:52,109
Rym: But high school like once I had a car and a bike and my parents basically is considered me an adult at that point I basically just would like not go to sleep.

683
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:58,630
Rym: Like I would just like I'd go to sleep at like 2 I'd wake up at like 6 30 to go to high school.

684
00:42:59,355 --> 00:43:01,046
Rym: I do like high school for a couple hours.

685
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:02,556
Rym: I'd say fuck it I just leave.

686
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:05,714
Rym: I'd go to the park and nap for like two hours Go back to school.

687
00:43:05,814 --> 00:43:06,658
Rym: make up some excuse.

688
00:43:06,678 --> 00:43:09,307
Rym: so I I didn't get in trouble like oh I was like.

689
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:11,962
Rym: I tell the band teacher Oh, I was helping the drama club or something.

690
00:43:12,204 --> 00:43:14,782
Rym: and I tell the drama teacher Oh, actually, I had to go help the band teacher.

691
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:15,789
Rym: No one ever called me on it.

692
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:20,828
Rym: Anyway, and then I get home I take another nap and then I'd stay up until 4 a.m.

693
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:21,410
Rym: And do the same thing.

694
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,093
Rym: I didn't do that.

695
00:43:22,173 --> 00:43:24,744
Scott: Anyway, so actual sleeping, right?

696
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:27,496
Scott: I'm lucky and that Relatively speaking.

697
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:36,910
Scott: I don't have too many sleeping problems Lay down I close my eye and then I know if I close my eyes and I want to be asleep I am asleep within 30 seconds, right?

698
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:47,225
Scott: I know a lot of people I know have like an insomnia of some kind where they can't sleep and a lot of them talk about How basically their brain is constantly thinking of stuff all the time.

699
00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:48,790
Scott: Yeah, and that sort of keeps them up.

700
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,710
Scott: I've experienced that I guess mildly on occasion.

701
00:43:51,911 --> 00:43:56,405
Scott: It usually happens more if the following day is gonna be a weird day.

702
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,789
Rym: Yep a weird day, right?

703
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:09,800
Scott: Going on a long flight to Australia or tomorrow I'm biking really far or if I got a complicated thing that I have to do the night to wake up at a different time Tomorrow and do something way out of habit.

704
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:12,510
Scott: I'll be thinking a lot about it the night before that.

705
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,455
Scott: Yeah, also the food I eat.

706
00:44:14,495 --> 00:44:20,130
Scott: we you know, it's not talking about dream situations, but obviously get some some cheese dreams, right?

707
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:23,778
Scott: Well, I mean, it's like if I eat a bunch of Thanksgiving I'm gonna fall asleep way faster.

708
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:26,090
Scott: if I eat a bunch of sugar it's gonna be a problem.

709
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:31,930
Rym: Yep, and cuz I'm in my 30s if I eat like pizza too late at night, I'll get woken up with the heartburn.

710
00:44:31,974 --> 00:44:39,370
Scott: Yeah It's bad to eat Too close to going to sleep and it's also bad to like look at screens too close to go in the snow along those lines.

711
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:40,374
Rym: Remember at RIT?

712
00:44:40,434 --> 00:44:42,624
Rym: I had like a lot of like heartburn and throat problems.

713
00:44:43,005 --> 00:44:44,170
Scott: Was that from eating before sleeping?

714
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,033
Rym: No was so.

715
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:54,090
Rym: I'd thought it was that but I finally just went to the doctor Mm-hmm, and I was like, so I have all this wicked heartburn and she looks at me and she doesn't what she says.

716
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,656
Rym: She's like, there's literally nothing wrong with you.

717
00:44:56,118 --> 00:44:58,970
Rym: And then she's like, so how much sleep do you get per night?

718
00:44:59,211 --> 00:45:00,157
Rym: And that was RIT's.

719
00:45:00,257 --> 00:45:02,250
Rym: I was like, I don't know four and a half five hours.

720
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,996
Rym: She was like, that's your fucking problem.

721
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,761
Rym: Hey sleep go to bed.

Rym: That's your fucking problems.

724
00:45:09,234 --> 00:45:10,119
Rym: She went on this tired.

725
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:10,843
Rym: What is it with you?

00:45:10,883 --> 00:45:12,110
Rym: kids go to sleep?

727
00:45:12,651 --> 00:45:16,830
Rym: And I started like remember there was a time at RIT Lane colony where I started like going to bed.

728
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:27,710
Rym: But even when you guys were staying up a little bit suddenly all my heartburn went away like my like everything was a 180 Yeah But yeah, so but you know, I know people have that problem where they can't get to sleep.

729
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:28,733
Scott: Yeah, that sucks.

730
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:32,824
Scott: And I also know people who have a problem where you're like narcolepsy.

731
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:35,150
Scott: It's like yep suddenly that's real dangerous.

732
00:45:37,191 --> 00:45:38,054
Scott: Less people have that.

733
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:40,461
Scott: it seems like insomnia seems to be super super common.

734
00:45:40,582 --> 00:45:43,310
Scott: So narcolepsy is rarer but still too common.

735
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:55,534
Rym: There's a difference between narcolepsy and microsleep because if you just if you don't have any other medical conditions But you just did not sleep enough then you'll get so tired that you'll just have like microsleeps, you know where you're like, yeah Yeah, that's that happens.

736
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:58,004
Rym: Uh, jerk yourself up microsleeps.

737
00:45:58,205 --> 00:45:58,466
Scott: Yep.

738
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:02,990
Rym: I Used to get those a lot because I didn't fucking sleep like ever.

739
00:46:03,392 --> 00:46:09,695
Scott: I only get those on the rare occasions that I don't get enough sleep or if I try to stay up too late I'll start having like.

740
00:46:10,136 --> 00:46:14,530
Scott: there have been occasions where like say I'm reading a super exciting book in bed, right?

741
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,029
Scott: Yeah, I'm like should go to sleep.

742
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:16,913
Scott: Book too good.

743
00:46:17,014 --> 00:46:19,564
Scott: Keep reading book and then book hits me in the face.

744
00:46:19,604 --> 00:46:20,025
Scott: Literally.

745
00:46:20,126 --> 00:46:20,327
Scott: Yep.

746
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:21,190
Scott: I bet that happened.

747
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,857
Scott: I'd say that's a microsleep right there.

748
00:46:22,877 --> 00:46:25,869
Rym: I have woken up with a book like crumpled on the bed.

749
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:28,621
Scott: next I hit my head with my iPad too on occasion.

750
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:30,610
Scott: It's pretty rare, but it's not zero times.

751
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:34,503
Rym: I dropped the switch on my face a few weeks ago.

752
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:36,710
Scott: That does not happen cuz I usually play switch in living room.

753
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,563
Rym: Yeah, but I was playing switch laying in a bed in a hotel room.

754
00:46:39,804 --> 00:46:41,170
Rym: Yeah, and I was playing slay the spider.

755
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:43,326
Scott: I've like woken up with a DS next to me.

756
00:46:43,366 --> 00:46:43,769
Scott: That's on.

757
00:46:45,195 --> 00:46:45,908
Scott: Yeah, that happens.

758
00:46:47,693 --> 00:46:50,730
Rym: But it's interesting how much of that seems to be tied to like routines.

759
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:54,830
Rym: Like if you have a very strong routine in your life your body just seems to adapt to it.

760
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:00,715
Rym: So like if you always fall asleep at the same time and wake up at the same time your body will just do that without Alarms or without right.

761
00:47:00,755 --> 00:47:02,382
Scott: that is a problem that I do have.

762
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:06,561
Scott: is that on occasion It seems like maybe a few times a year.

763
00:47:06,581 --> 00:47:08,230
Scott: I'll have it maybe once twice a year.

764
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:11,949
Scott: My body just like like wakes up stupid early.

765
00:47:12,891 --> 00:47:14,138
Rym: Never had that right?

766
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:14,882
Scott: It's like it's.

767
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:16,470
Scott: it's like I'll have normal sleep.

768
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,538
Scott: I know my sleep is relatively normal.

769
00:47:18,578 --> 00:47:21,570
Scott: Like I said compared to insomnia narcolepsy people have real problems.

770
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,738
Scott: Right is like it's relatively normal.

771
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,308
Scott: I lay down and go to sleep and then I wake up in the morning, right?

772
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:27,556
Scott: I'm pretty deep.

773
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:28,384
Scott: It's hard to wake me up.

774
00:47:28,424 --> 00:47:31,020
Scott: a little relative You can wake me up, but it's not it's not.

775
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,890
Scott: honestly I don't wake up at the drop of a hat.

776
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:37,170
Rym: I would sleep crazy like I know some people will wake up if there's like at the tiniest noise.

777
00:47:37,532 --> 00:47:38,638
Rym: What's that actually asleep?

778
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:40,289
Rym: It's really hard to wake me up.

779
00:47:40,555 --> 00:47:42,877
Scott: Hey But the point is you have to like shake me.

780
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:48,018
Scott: there are still times we're like for some reason like like a few months ago I had a problem.

781
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:48,342
Scott: We're like.

782
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:51,881
Scott: I Felt like I was waking up like super waking up.

783
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:54,030
Scott: Like I felt like wow, that was a complete the sleep.

784
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:58,787
Scott: Let's open my eyes and open my eyes and look at the watt my clock and it would be like 1 a.m.

785
00:47:59,631 --> 00:48:01,910
Scott: And I'm like, I went to bed at like 10 11.

786
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,395
Rym: Oh, that's the best.

787
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:14,725
Scott: though if I that time when I do I feel like I'm super fully slept after like two three hours Yeah, and then I go back to sleep and then I wake up again and it's like, all right What time the fuck is it now for that three?

788
00:48:14,846 --> 00:48:24,626
Rym: Okay, great One of the best feelings in the world is because usually it's so specific on weekdays I wake up at exactly 7 no matter what I'm just awake.

789
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:27,494
Scott: mine kind of floats around In the 7 area.

790
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:30,605
Rym: if I set my alarm for 655, it'll wake me up.

791
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:33,074
Rym: if I set it for 705 I'll wake up.

792
00:48:33,435 --> 00:48:34,821
Rym: I'll reach over grab my phone.

793
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:37,190
Scott: It's exactly said they're the majority of the time.

794
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,469
Scott: It's something around like that.

795
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:41,823
Scott: But there are times we're like I sleep for just some reason.

796
00:48:41,843 --> 00:48:43,570
Scott: we'll get messed up and weird things will happen.

797
00:48:44,012 --> 00:48:54,424
Scott: Usually in the waking up early department this going to sleep I don't have too many problems, but the what, you know, it's only like I said the rare, okay Yeah, I'm thinking too much and I can't sleep.

798
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:57,770
Scott: but more common Wake up early for who the fuck knows?

799
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:57,911
Scott: I

800
00:48:57,931 --> 00:49:11,609
Rym: think one thing that happened to me specifically because it messed up my eating schedule to a little bit like kind of permanently is I had that job when I when we lived in Beacon where I had to get an ass early train because I worked seven to Four in Manhattan and I did that for like almost four years.

801
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:18,878
Rym: So as a result like this and it was Metro North it was if I missed that train I was gonna be an hour late to work.

802
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:26,565
Rym: I never missed that train in four years But it really ingrained this like hyper specific schedule in my life of wake up.

803
00:49:26,606 --> 00:49:30,720
Rym: at this exact time you have Exactly eight minutes to get to the train station.

804
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:37,330
Rym: Yeah eat lunch at 1105 leave work at 405 to catch the 411 train home and to this day.

805
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,382
Rym: I think that just like set these schedules in my brain that will never go away.

806
00:49:40,403 --> 00:49:44,035
Rym: Mmm, like I still eat lunch at 11 I can't even if I eat breakfast.

807
00:49:44,075 --> 00:49:45,480
Rym: I just I get hungry at exactly 11.

808
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,817
Rym: Mm-hmm and I get hangry if I don't eat by 1130.

809
00:49:49,817 --> 00:49:59,898
Rym: But the other thing is I used to go on a lot of road trips like a lot of road trips and I was usually the only driver on these road trips and Remember even our IT.

810
00:49:59,918 --> 00:50:07,010
Rym: whenever I went home to like see my family I would always wait till like midnight and then I drive through the Canadian wilderness from midnight until dawn.

811
00:50:08,151 --> 00:50:12,265
Rym: So I had a lot of experience driving when I'm really really really tired.

812
00:50:12,326 --> 00:50:13,490
Scott: That's really really dangerous.

813
00:50:14,331 --> 00:50:20,290
Rym: But as a result, I had this like very hyper specific like cannot fall asleep mode that I can put myself into.

814
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,614
Scott: Yeah, I guess that is.

815
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:27,255
Scott: that is also a thing is like even though I if I lay down I can and I'm tired I can go to sleep.

816
00:50:27,577 --> 00:50:29,410
Scott: I can probably even do it if I'm not that tired.

817
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:35,099
Scott: Yeah, but I have a real hard time sleeping in Weird positions like right.

818
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:40,121
Rym: a lot of people say that like oh, I can't sleep on planes Right sleeping on a plane because I'm sitting up.

819
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:40,744
Scott: I'm not laying.

820
00:50:40,824 --> 00:50:43,515
Scott: if I was laying down I'd be fine But it's I'm sitting up right?

821
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:51,145
Scott: It's like I need to lay down flat if I'm or at least mostly for some reason I don't like I've fallen asleep standing up before I mean I have.

822
00:50:51,246 --> 00:50:53,475
Rym: I kind of fell over Super tired.

823
00:50:53,576 --> 00:50:57,356
Scott: I can like I have slept on plane like I could sleep in this chair But it's not.

824
00:50:57,376 --> 00:51:07,960
Scott: I mean I could if I was super tired but like I could be a little bit tired or barely tired and sleep in a bed just For me to sleep in a chair or some other position.

825
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:13,019
Rym: I need you know to be extra tired doesn't matter What time of day does any plan I get on to.

826
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:21,630
Rym: I see even if it's like the crappy economy seat on a shitty Airline in the middle of the day soon as I sit on that plane two or three minutes go by I'm tired And I just fall asleep.

827
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:26,047
Scott: I can only do that if it's like a long flight, and I get way tired if it's.

828
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:28,438
Scott: if the flights too short I won't actually fall asleep.

829
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:33,819
Scott: I can like close my eyes and sort of But I won't like really sleep.

830
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:38,674
Scott: You know unless it's I get extra tired Because I'm not.

831
00:51:38,714 --> 00:51:44,272
Scott: but if I was laying down right I could like immediately Mmm.

832
00:51:44,472 --> 00:51:48,730
Rym: Yeah, I was about to get into dreams, but we already did a show on dreams.

833
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:53,894
Scott: I mean I think we did a show on mattresses Pillows and blankets.

834
00:51:54,456 --> 00:51:57,990
Scott: we're gonna buy a new mattress, so let's just end it by talking about sleeping positions.

835
00:51:58,111 --> 00:52:07,368
Scott: I mostly sleep on the right side of my body Touching the mattress and I got semi fetal positions, so I can sleep in other positions like I toss and turn at night.

836
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,480
Scott: sometimes I'll just go like you know face down on the on.

837
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,307
Scott: the thing is like my second best position.

838
00:52:12,568 --> 00:52:15,730
Scott: I Partly because you sleep like the month like a vampire.

839
00:52:15,991 --> 00:52:21,330
Rym: I sleep like a vampire like I'm like it's such a flat on back like I I cannot sleep except on my back.

840
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:26,890
Scott: If I sleep on my side my arms, and you can say you said you can sleep in an airplane though sitting up is fine.

841
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,650
Rym: But if I'm in a bed, I like sitting up is fine.

842
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:46,457
Rym: I can sleep sitting up if I'm lying down if I lie on my side My arms and legs will fall asleep because I'm so skinny and bony That it just like compresses and like everything instantly falls asleep like in the bad way And my legs are really thick.

843
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:50,210
Rym: so they'll if I let you sleep on my side unless I'm very careful things get crushed.

844
00:52:52,738 --> 00:52:53,809
Rym: You don't have huge games.

845
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,930
Rym: Okay Do you understand the scale of my games?

846
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,075
Scott: That's in front of your legs.

847
00:53:00,397 --> 00:53:11,793
Rym: Yeah between them, but then if I've been to lay on my side And they're like pushed out in front, but then if I move my legs at all I'll I crush him in my sleep or now my leg will fall asleep Uh-huh.

848
00:53:12,195 --> 00:53:13,906
Rym: so I can only sleep on my back.

849
00:53:13,946 --> 00:53:26,108
Rym: if I'm in a bed And I tend to just naturally pull my arms up in the cross position like over myself like I'm just now And I just I'm silent I'm just laying there not moving.

850
00:53:26,128 --> 00:53:32,810
Scott: also I like to be on the side of the bed where since I'm my the right side of my body is touching the mattress.

851
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:33,412
Scott: Right.

852
00:53:33,774 --> 00:53:37,570
Scott: I want to be on the side of the bed where I'm basically super close to the edge.

853
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:41,286
Rym: Oh, we are we alternate every few years which side of the bed.

854
00:53:41,326 --> 00:53:41,688
Rym: We're on.

855
00:53:41,909 --> 00:53:42,915
Scott: okay That's not the worst.

856
00:53:42,995 --> 00:53:44,445
Rym: I say like kind of like with my wallet.

857
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:51,409
Rym: actually in 2020 It's time to move my wallet from my back left pocket back to my back right pocket while always front right pocket.

858
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,294
Rym: Never never pocket.

859
00:53:53,455 --> 00:53:55,783
Scott: nothing in the back pocket where it can be all in the back pocket.

860
00:53:55,824 --> 00:53:56,747
Scott: nothing in the back pocket.

861
00:53:57,088 --> 00:53:58,316
Rym: always wallet My whole wallet.

862
00:53:58,337 --> 00:53:59,729
Scott: I don't want to sit on nothing up.

863
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:01,439
Rym: I have jeans where it doesn't.

864
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:05,483
Scott: I'm not actually sitting on it cuz it's on the side So it's easy for me to just snatch it out while you're sitting.

865
00:54:05,504 --> 00:54:08,569
Rym: no cuz they're really tight jeans I defy you to get my wallet out of my pants.

866
00:54:10,351 --> 00:54:14,109
Rym: YouTube video I'll sit you try to get the wallet out of my pants, and then I'll run right with your wallet.

867
00:54:17,493 --> 00:54:17,976
Rym: But no like.

868
00:54:18,017 --> 00:54:19,428
Rym: if you see like people make fun of me.

869
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:23,690
Rym: Firstly you see me sleeping, and I'm just a Nosferatu like it's weird.

870
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:27,560
Scott: Maybe I'll suggest that bed switching hadn't thought of that idea.

871
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:30,370
Rym: like everything like long cycle is the right way to do it.

872
00:54:31,872 --> 00:54:39,911
Rym: Part of it's because in the morning are like the movie the bunny will Do its funny stuff and whoever seem on one side of the bed gets to watch it mm-hmm and the other person can't really see It.

873
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:42,970
Rym: so we alternate every now, and then it's about time to alternate again.

874
00:54:46,091 --> 00:54:48,889
Rym: Yeah, top blankets anything else will defer to another show.

875
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:50,857
