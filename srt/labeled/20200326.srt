1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,051
Rym: It's Thursday March 26th 2020.

2
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:14,699
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:20,175
Rym: tonight We are talking about insurance because we are not experts in this field.

4
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:26,220
Rym: Let's do this All right.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,667
Rym: So, uh try to avoid going to the grocery store like I'm doing it as little as I can like once a week go in With a list get everything to get out.

6
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:33,452
Scott: Yep.

7
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:34,900
Scott: Actually, it's a coincidence, right?

8
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:44,664
Scott: So we used blue apron in the past to get meals delivered Yeah, and then I cancelled it when I moved and I was like, you know after PAX East I was like, you know What let's start up a new.

9
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:46,852
Rym: Yeah, we're doing a bunch of delivery.

10
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:49,140
Scott: We're doing and I was like we're doing the purple carrot.

11
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:53,560
Rym: It's a vegan one and we're also doing this box of assorted ugly fruit.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,993
Rym: It's like stuff that grocery stores were gonna send back anyway, and they just give us.

13
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,940
Rym: so it's like a bunch of tomatoes and celery and stuff.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,697
Scott: Anyway, so I was like, hey, why don't I try these other ones instead of blue apron, right?

15
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:05,580
Scott: Let's see what they're about.

16
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:08,774
Scott: I didn't want to try the which one was it.

17
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:14,160
Scott: Hello fresh because Nothing, you know nothing to do with the service, but they advertise everywhere.

18
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:15,885
Scott: Yeah, but they were.

19
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:21,462
Scott: at one point they were marketing by harrat aggressively harassing people in the subway like they would come up to me Okay.

20
00:01:21,522 --> 00:01:23,027
Scott: Hey, hey, and that makes me like, alright.

21
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:26,259
Scott: Well because you did that now, I'm not gonna patronize your business.

22
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:26,520
Scott: Yeah.

23
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,670
Scott: So I went and I googled and I found one.

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,525
Scott: I'm like, oh, there's so many of these friggin things now It's crazy.

25
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:33,614
Scott: how might how many there are?

26
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:37,600
Scott: It's like picked one called home chef because it was highly rated.

27
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:41,579
Scott: And then it's just and then we got locked inside after at that.

28
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:46,677
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people must have started tried to start these after.

29
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:51,220
Rym: well cuz fresh direct It's so hard to get a delivery slot that like they're completely overwhelmed.

30
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:55,340
Rym: So a lot of people have been going to these other services like well anyone who lost their job.

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,147
Scott: Why doesn't fresh direct, you know hire?

32
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,100
Scott: Yeah, make some people to make deliveries, right?

33
00:02:00,682 --> 00:02:02,270
Rym: I think it might just get their supply chain too.

34
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:04,480
Scott: Well, they also just don't have as many trucks, right?

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,184
Scott: You get any more trucks?

36
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:07,800
Scott: Yep to make more deliveries, but the interesting thing.

37
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:10,220
Rym: So I wanted a delivery slot on fresh direct.

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,759
Rym: But every time I checked all the slots for the next seven days were you know?

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Scott: Yeah, we we tried once or twice also and it's like I fuck it, but I am a member of the chef's table.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,375
Rym: So it's basically the rewards program.

41
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:32,880
Rym: if you use it Basically, if you use it as your like primary or sole grocery store long enough, then they're just like, okay You're in our you're basically in our little rewards program.

42
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:48,110
Rym: And all that means is instead of picking a time slot when you like finish a cart You can reserve a time slot in advance up to a week in advance And you can even reserve a recurring one Mm-hmm, but they're also allowed even in advance.

43
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,732
Rym: I was just fucked.

44
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:52,983
Rym: So last night I thought okay It's got a rollover.

45
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:57,095
Rym: at some point the eighth day becomes the seventh day and appears there.

46
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:58,579
Scott: Yeah, someone told me it was 6 a.m.

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,067
Scott: I don't know if that's true or not.

48
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:01,395
Rym: I don't think that's true.

49
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:10,734
Rym: 6 a.m is when like the cutoff is for putting in orders for like Later orders that evening and there is a 6 a.m.

50
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:12,180
Rym: Cut off for a bunch of things on fresh, right?

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,668
Rym: But I don't think that's when the thing rolls.

52
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:18,893
Rym: All right, so I thought okay I'll wait till midnight and I'll see if it rolls at midnight.

53
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:22,748
Rym: and at midnight It's not that it rolled.

54
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,523
Rym: It's that if you click to reserve It sits there forever and then times out and I think a million people are hitting a five Mmm.

55
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:40,177
Rym: But basically I did discover that later in the day like around 1 p.m The slots appear suddenly, but they only appear for the chef's table.

56
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:48,280
Rym: people first Fancy and then later that day they appear for everyone else and then the chef's table ones mostly seem to sell out within like an hour.

57
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:49,562
Scott: Hmm.

58
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:53,280
Scott: I mean the grocery store next to us still has pretty much everything that we need.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,369
Rym: Oh, yeah food seller is completely stocked.

60
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,940
Scott: Like I'm not other than like toilet paper and English muffins.

61
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,622
Scott: They have everything.

62
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:00,529
Rym: my food seller has plenty of toilet paper too.

63
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:01,111
Rym: If you run low.

64
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:03,580
Scott: Oh, they ran out of fresh basil.

65
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,370
Rym: That was it, but I finally I just got lucky.

66
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,237
Scott: I found the food seller has TP.

67
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,263
Rym: Yeah Okay.

68
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:17,700
Rym: All right, cool They basically are sold out of nothing Except if you go at certain times some things are not fully stocked because they I think they're stocking less frequently.

69
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,316
Rym: So like when we were there last time they didn't have any fish, but they had everything else.

70
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:26,819
Rym: the time before that They didn't have any non fish meat, but they had like literally everything else.

71
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:32,035
Rym: Mmm, fresh direct has everything except they're completely sold out of toilet paper.

72
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,700
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

73
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:48,952
Scott: So, yeah, but yeah this home chef compared to the blue apron I have to say that on the one hand It's nice that the meals that I got were way Simpler and easier and faster to prepare who's kind of cool.

74
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:49,514
Rym: That's a plus.

75
00:04:50,136 --> 00:05:01,554
Scott: Yeah, it's a plus except Part of the reason they were easier to prepare is because they weren't like bad but they're just not as Fancy and good right like one of them.

76
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:15,212
Scott: the worst thing You know, it's the old the biggest thing that like, you know it was actually like a negative check mark for me was that one of the recipes included rice and Usually when a blue apron includes rice, it's like alright, here's a packet of rice.

77
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,640
Scott: cook it right and I put it in my rice cooker.

78
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:25,950
Scott: This one had a sealed a vacuum sealed package of already cooked rice Parboiled rice fuck that.

79
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:35,741
Scott: and you were supposed to Put it in a bowl with like a couple tablespoons of water and then microwave the bowl to get the rice up to Temperature.

80
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,406
Rym: Oh, that is a sad sack TV dinner right there, right?

81
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:44,405
Scott: And I couldn't even I mean it tasted fine, but it's like You just don't you forget.

82
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:44,666
Scott: do that.

83
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:45,770
Scott: Don't even send me the rice.

84
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:47,216
Scott: I can just make my own rice.

85
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:47,819
Scott: I don't need this.

86
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:52,815
Rym: Yeah, we restarted Blue Apron because apparently what they did is they changed.

87
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:57,179
Rym: they have fewer recipes now but it's recipes they can make much more easily in bulk.

88
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:05,220
Rym: and Because we didn't get fresh direct We figured that would be a good way to start cooking real meals again without having to go out to the grocery store literally every week.

89
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:09,721
Scott: Yeah, I'll give the home chef another, you know a little while and then you know If it's.

90
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:13,480
Scott: if it's man, maybe I'll go back to Blue Apron or maybe try another one.

91
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,746
Scott: Yeah, it's a whole bunch of them out there.

92
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,133
Rym: I'm just trying whichever

93
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:18,764
Scott: one could make a delivery happen I'll sign up for yep,

94
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:39,900
Rym: because otherwise I just got to keep going to the grocery store, which I'd rather avoid if I could Alright, so, uh in the news there's a lot of news going on, but I discovered something that seemed like a joke and I kind of thought it was someone just making a joke, but then on Wikipedia I saw it and then I kept looking around and it seems totally legit.

95
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:48,388
Rym: Apparently the first honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters, you know, there's real members who actually perform But then there's honorary members.

96
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:51,720
Rym: like when you get an honorary PhD, it doesn't mean you're a real doctor.

97
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,760
Rym: It just means that the university wanted to recognize you in some way.

98
00:06:55,591 --> 00:07:03,559
Rym: so Apparently Henry Kissinger is an honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters and was the first honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters.

99
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,119
Scott: I mean, why don't they revoke that?

100
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,322
Rym: Right, like.

101
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:12,921
Rym: I'm looking down this list of like the 10 notable Harlem Globetrotter like honorary people and the rest of the list is all great People.

102
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:17,700
Rym: it's all like Bob Hope, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Whoopi Goldberg, Nelson Mandela.

103
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:27,694
Rym: But hanging out right at number one is Henry Kissinger with and apparently he said something funny about it and Like one of the skittles in the bowl is poison.

104
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:28,959
Scott: How many skittles do you eat?

105
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:34,499
Scott: How many honorary Harlem Globetrotters will you will you eat?

106
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,791
Rym: Of course at the same time if you've dropped your Jamaican beef patty into a pile of glass How much of that Jamaican beef patty will you risk eating?

107
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:43,660
Rym: The answer was not zero.

108
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:56,483
Rym: But uh, I do have a geek bite Emily and I. the other night we watched a movie we've been meaning to watch for a while Jojo rabbit, which Do you know anything about?

109
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:59,354
Scott: I heard I heard that there was a movie called Jojo rabbit.

110
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:00,859
Scott: I didn't I don't know nothing else.

111
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:04,606
Rym: Treat it more like cinema.

112
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:10,158
Rym: It's one of those like Oscar bait like very well done period made the movie Taika Waititi.

113
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:15,094
Rym: Okay So the shtick of it, I don't know how to spoil anything.

114
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:25,319
Rym: But if you put the trailers Sort of on one hand almost like give you the wrong idea of what this movie is about But on the other hand, they're actually very true to what the movie is.

115
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:29,108
Rym: It's basically about a kid growing up with Hitler during Nazi, Germany.

116
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:32,380
Scott: Why is it called Jojo rabbit?

117
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:46,440
Rym: So what it really is is about a kid who is basically growing up as a child during World War two and He's a kid like he doesn't quite understand like everything and he's definitely bought into the propaganda.

118
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:47,700
Rym: Like he's a member of the Hitler youth.

119
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:54,520
Rym: He's totally into it and he has an imaginary friend like Hobbes and Calvin and Hobbes, but his imaginary friend is Hitler.

120
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,370
Scott: His imaginary friend isn't Jojo rabbit.

121
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:58,033
Rym: No, he is.

122
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:04,760
Rym: His name is Jojo and The reason he is called Jojo rabbit is a plot point that I'm not gonna get into but it's the metaphor for the whole movie.

123
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:20,759
Rym: But it's basically this kid with his imaginary friend Hitler traipsing around during World War two toward the end of the war and it is a Really really good movie and I hesitate to even really get into what it's really about and what the themes are.

124
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:25,939
Rym: Other than that, you should watch it and I think everyone should see it be ready to cry a lot.

125
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:29,133
Scott: I've seen almost every Nazi movie.

126
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,660
Rym: There is this one's up there.

127
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,617
Rym: This one deserves to be in the list of like Nazi movies.

128
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,368
Rym: You need to see Uh-huh.

129
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:38,404
Rym: All right Because it's it.

130
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:42,900
Rym: it's hard to explain like the bits that are good about it without really spoiling main themes.

131
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,240
Rym: But like it's Hitler and it's Hitler Hitler.

132
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:51,200
Rym: But it's Hitler as imagined by a child who idolizes him having bought into the propaganda.

133
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:56,338
Rym: Uh-huh, and it's just to Hitler's this like childhood imaginary friend.

134
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:56,719
Rym: Let's go.

135
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,649
Rym: Okay, it's an all-star cast.

136
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,215
Rym: Like the the acting is amazing.

137
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:05,175
Rym: The characters are great All right, whatever.

138
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,646
Scott: Yeah What streaming service is it on?

139
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:09,192
Rym: I just rent it.

140
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:10,035
Rym: It came out recently.

141
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,640
Rym: So I don't think it's on any streaming services.

142
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:16,479
Rym: I rented it for $3 from Amazon Mmm, I've been using that option.

143
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:17,865
Scott: You know more.

144
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:22,160
Rym: yeah for a movie that I care to see like I want to see that I know is gonna be good.

145
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,880
Rym: That's the option that it's guaranteed to be high quality.

146
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:32,968
Scott: I don't have to fuss around on the high most even doing it for movies that I would might want to like rewatch Many times over the years.

147
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:33,852
Scott: Mmm, right?

148
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:35,820
Scott: So like Lord of the Rings movies I have on there.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,767
Scott: Yeah, cuz I don't have I wouldn't.

150
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:40,197
Scott: during when everyone else is buying the DVD box sets.

151
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:40,840
Scott: I refrained.

152
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,979
Scott: Yep, so I don't have two statues of great.

153
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,425
Rym: I still have those statues though.

154
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,969
Rym: The hand is broken off of one of them.

155
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,356
Scott: That's I guess appropriate.

156
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:52,878
Rym: I Still have the hand.

157
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,651
Rym: Yeah anyway But Jojo 100% a-plus movie.

158
00:10:58,671 --> 00:10:59,072
Rym: go see it.

159
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:05,920
Scott: So back in the day We already did a GeekNights episode about the Castlevania that is on Netflix.

160
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:17,394
Scott: I think we only talked about season one at the time because we don't know in season one I don't know how many even episodes of season one that we saw But I did watch season two in its entirety when it came out.

161
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:23,090
Scott: and season three came out I guess a few weeks ago maybe but I watched the first half of season three.

162
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:31,919
Scott: So just to update anyone on that show if you only listen to that GeekNights and wanted to know more I guess.

163
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,159
Scott: So the second season kicks ass.

164
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:51,884
Scott: It's a lot like, you know They're going into Dracula's castle and fighting and doing the biz and oh, yeah This is all these other characters that are hanging out with sort of like Dracula's Court of you know Helping people people that would be bosses that you would fight on the way to Dracula, you know And all that stuff.

165
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:54,232
Rym: I remember people kept making fun of it in a good way.

166
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:54,573
Rym: being like.

167
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,344
Rym: it's basically like Castlevania 3.

168
00:11:57,344 --> 00:11:57,979
Scott: It's self-aware.

169
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:10,260
Scott: So in the season three what you have is you've actually got like four different separate plot lines Going on that don't bump into each other at least not in the first five episodes.

170
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,450
Scott: It's like clearly they're heading towards a snatch moment.

171
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,740
Scott: All right, but to start out they're completely separate.

172
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,060
Scott: So it's like the is a la card hanging out doing his thing with some new characters, right?

173
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,529
Scott: completely separately.

174
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:40,938
Scott: is Belmont and friend doing a thing in a creepy town with some priests that have obviously turned bad with some creepy thing going on in their church in the Like the first episode of Fullmetal Alchemist and and Saint Germain shows up there, which is a little right?

175
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:59,780
Scott: Yeah, and then separately you have one of the characters from season two who is Captured by the ice queen vampire and is dragged back to the ice palace with the other three Vampire queens is like four vampire queens that run the ice palace and he's their prisoner.

176
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:02,800
Scott: So that's like a plot line of what's going on in the ice palace.

177
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:15,396
Scott: Yeah Right, and then the fourth plot line is one of the bad dudes who is like Dracula's helper in season two Was sort of during season two got like teleported far away.

178
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,220
Scott: It's like the desert.

179
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,827
Scott: Yeah, it's presumably like Northern Africa.

180
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:19,329
Rym: So what is he?

181
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,676
Rym: just been walking back toward the plot the whole time?

182
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:23,180
Scott: Yeah, right exactly.

183
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:31,380
Scott: He's got like a. he's got like an army of beast men Night creatures because he's a bad dude and he got on a pirate ship.

184
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,952
Scott: I guess not a pirate ship but like a cool Jamaican dude's ship.

185
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,380
Scott: and the Jamaican dude brought him back to Genoa.

186
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,888
Scott: Ah, he got off the be got off the boat in Genoa.

187
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:46,847
Scott: So he's like on his way back with his army of Evil night creatures.

188
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,540
Rym: I like an army of beast men because that just reminds me of slayers.

189
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:51,546
Scott: So that's definitely my favorite plot.

190
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:56,642
Scott: is the the evil beast guy and also the churchy one is kind of cliche But I'm into it.

191
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:58,407
Scott: the ice princess one.

192
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:07,629
Scott: I think could go ice print ice queen vampire one could go somewhere but it's a little man and The ala card in the woods.

193
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,060
Scott: one is just like snooze time But at least that one doesn't take a lot of screen time.

194
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:20,758
Scott: All four of those plot lines are gonna I guess converge at some point and everyone will be the party will get back together and They'll be action, right?

195
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,972
Rym: Yeah, we'll probably do a full review once we watch all of it.

196
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:30,920
Scott: at this point cuz I'm watching all of it Like I'm not gonna I'm wondering how many seasons is gonna go for is like this third season can't be the final one the way.

197
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,469
Scott: Yeah, they wrap all these four plot lines up in five episodes.

198
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:38,259
Scott: I think it's a ten episode thing maybe and we've watched five.

199
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:45,894
Rym: so Yeah, maybe maybe this is like the lead-up to the end and then there'll be one more season But I don't actually know.

200
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,285
Rym: Actually, let's see number.

201
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,490
Rym: does Wikipedia say anything.

202
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:49,690
Rym: Nope.

203
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,116
Rym: It only shows up through season three.

204
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:56,358
Rym: Ah Doesn't say anything about a season four No idea.

205
00:14:57,685 --> 00:14:57,969
Scott: All right.

206
00:14:58,132 --> 00:14:59,927
Rym: All right, cool All right.

207
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:08,389
Rym: Anyway, it's time for things of the day.

208
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,049
Rym: What do you got so?

209
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,615
Scott: Uh What was my thing of the day?

210
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:19,190
Scott: Ah, yes, everyone's trapped inside right not going out and including like famous people, right?

211
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,928
Scott: So you're seeing lots of people are producing lots of content, you know.

212
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:26,479
Scott: Posting things on you know creative endeavors.

213
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:30,450
Scott: They're engaging in while they're trapped inside on the internet including famous people.

214
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,310
Scott: So I've seen like, you know, and it's a wide range of famous people, right and and not famous people.

215
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:42,710
Scott: People are getting more creative and putting more effort into posting things to like, you know share with everyone else, right?

216
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:54,594
Scott: So like you just mentioned before the show Sir Patrick Stewart got CBS to let Picard be free even to people who aren't paying or the CBS streaming Tons of like.

217
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,403
Rym: little game companies are releasing like their older games for free.

218
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:59,188
Rym: So like bored kids have something to do, right?

219
00:15:59,790 --> 00:15:59,830
Scott: We?

220
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,529
Scott: I just saw a video Lea's Anderson who I guess can't play hockey right now.

221
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:08,363
Scott: he Just broke the record for wearing the most hockey jerseys at once.

222
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:25,900
Scott: He's got nothing better to do Right, but one really interesting thing I saw was a noted astrophysicist Brian May Posted on posted on Instagram Demonstrating his guitar skills, right which?

223
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:27,605
Scott: what is presumably his?

224
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:35,710
Scott: the actual original You know red special guitar he made with his father and not some replica, I'm not expert enough to know.

225
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,989
Rym: I mean, I would assume so if I had a homer bat like I would always use it.

226
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:46,909
Scott: Yeah, but I mean I have seen him Use not the original one before Yeah, but anyway.

227
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:52,350
Scott: but you know You see when you look at a lot of guitar lessons online, right?

228
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:59,965
Scott: Because I did guitar when I was in elementary school for a few years and then I tried to learn Relearn it once or twice, right?

229
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,901
Scott: But you know, mostly you're learning like scales.

230
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:14,791
Scott: You're learning chords, right, you know and You don't really see when you're taking guitar lessons how to do a guitar solo Right.

231
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:21,909
Scott: It's like you just sort of get good enough to the point in which you can just go go wild improvisationally on your own, right?

232
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:31,348
Scott: But here he is Showing you right with the getting his phone camera really close to the guitar twice, you know playing it slowly, right?

233
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,830
Scott: Exactly how he plays the solo in the middle of noted song Bohemian Rhapsody.

234
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,606
Scott: So this is like a really, you know interesting kind of thing that you don't?

235
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:43,730
Scott: you don't see this, right?

236
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,157
Scott: I've never seen a guitar lesson.

237
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,001
Scott: I'm sure it's out there.

238
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,288
Scott: Someone's gonna point to them, right?

239
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,128
Scott: But I've never seen a guitar lesson that's like here's how to play the crazy solo that you know.

240
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:59,035
Rym: Because like in high school we I literally get like there'd be clinics on like how to do improvisation and a lot of the Aspects of those clinics.

241
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:08,750
Rym: they'd have us study and then recreate other people's Improvisational solos as practice and then we'd have to do our own solos over the same chord progressions, right?

242
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,993
Scott: But here he's actually showing you like, you know the actual Technique.

243
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:13,294
Scott: he's like.

244
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:17,630
Scott: look, you know, I strum this note and but then I you know go on and off.

245
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:19,701
Scott: I'm not actually strumming every note.

246
00:18:19,842 --> 00:18:21,651
Scott: Yeah this way in that way He's like.

247
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:24,721
Scott: he's like even in such a brief Instagram video.

248
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:30,849
Scott: It's actually way better at teaching Than a lot of other instructional videos I've seen.

249
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,893
Scott: So if anyone cares about guitars Or astrophysics.

250
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:43,145
Rym: Yeah, I mean you can read his thesis a survey of radial velocities in the zodiacal dust cloud from 2008.

251
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:46,179
Rym: Yeah So my thing today real simple.

252
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,585
Rym: This is I just found this.

253
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:48,670
Rym: I don't even know where I found it.

254
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,235
Rym: It's just this cute short animation.

255
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:51,118
Rym: Dr.

256
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:54,709
Rym: Mario is apparently doing a speedrun of his own game.

257
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:54,769
Rym: Dr.

258
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,806
Rym: Mario Luigi's timing him and he starts showing off and that's it.

259
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,952
Rym: That's the whole video Dr.

260
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,294
Scott: Mario.

261
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:02,742
Scott: speedrunning is a thing a lot.

262
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:04,170
Scott: I've seen a lot of people do it on Twitch.

263
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,704
Rym: I mean, I remember my big moment of speedrunning.

264
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:12,189
Rym: cuz like speedrunning has been a thing for a while But the one years ago I was thinking to myself

265
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:13,373
Scott: Man

266
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:25,568
Rym: I'd love to see a speedrun of like a 40-hour RPG and sure enough when I search for it I'd realize that there is a thriving community of people speedrunning like Final Fantasy 7 or some shit.

267
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,133
Scott: Yeah Well speedrunning.

268
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:27,414
Scott: Dr.

269
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:31,045
Scott: Mario is interesting because you know, you're not going for score right?

270
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:37,123
Scott: What you're trying to do is Beat it beat the levels with as few pieces as possible.

271
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:39,550
Scott: right the less pieces used the less waiting there is.

272
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,535
Scott: There's a little bit of RNG to add some excitement Especially toward.

273
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:46,490
Scott: you're like about to clear the level and you might not get the piece you need.

274
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,229
Scott: You've only got one color left for example.

275
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:49,834
Scott: But there's also.

276
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:50,356
Scott: you want to.

277
00:19:50,396 --> 00:20:00,890
Scott: you know, whenever you clear something if there's any pills that fall they go do do do do do And right and then you can't bring out your next pill until all the falling pieces have fallen.

278
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:04,789
Scott: So you need to play in such a way that you reduce how far?

279
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,441
Scott: Broken off pill pieces fall.

280
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:09,470
Scott: Yeah, that just that just kills.

281
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,350
Scott: Well, that just eats up your clock a whole bunch while you're waiting before you could bring out the next piece.

282
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:15,936
Scott: So it's actually it's.

283
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,748
Scott: it's pretty tough and pretty interesting way to play.

284
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:18,969
Scott: Dr.

285
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:25,629
Rym: Mario Yeah in the moment if you notice that we sound a little different that there's a little more pausing We talk over each other a little bit.

286
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:37,471
Rym: This is the well the third time ever because apparently neither one of us remember that we did record GeekNights Remotely once back in 2009 and somehow Luke remembered that even though neither one of us There's

287
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:38,415
Scott: it only one episode

288
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:44,369
Rym: one episode when you were already in your new apartment in the city And I was still sleeping at the Beacon House.

289
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:51,225
Rym: okay during that like three-week period where we were like moving everything around and like finalizing our flight from upstate.

290
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:58,366
Rym: so once in 2009 once two days ago and now today have we ever recorded GeekNights remotely?

291
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:03,250
Rym: it is More challenging than the normal show for a lot of reasons like the delay.

292
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:08,430
Rym: While it's slight and while I it doesn't like you won't hear it in the show because I can slide things and edit it out.

293
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:11,081
Rym: It does make it easier for us to talk over each other.

294
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:13,010
Rym: It's harder to like key off a body language.

295
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:14,903
Rym: We got to do some fucking body language.

296
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:18,389
Scott: I don't see with my eyes closed Yeah, but I can see yours and with you facing away from me.

297
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,413
Rym: Yeah, but you'll like shuffle a little bit like when I'm not when you're talking when you're saying a long thing I kind of lean back.

298
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:24,458
Rym: I turn around and look at you.

299
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,165
Rym: You don't see it cuz your eyes are closed.

300
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:30,170
Rym: Nope Also just headphones like that's not as comfortable.

301
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:32,038
Rym: I can't do the live stream as easily though.

302
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,510
Rym: I might be able to start live streaming this again soon.

303
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:37,490
Rym: I just didn't want to bother this week while we were testing.

304
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:42,270
Rym: So yeah for the foreseeable future GeekNights might sound a little weird and I just got to deal with it.

305
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:42,994
Rym: It's this or nothing.

306
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:45,165
Scott: Let's let's this weekend.

307
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:46,050
Scott: We got nothing else to do.

308
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,483
Scott: Let's figure out how to get to 2p one stream.

309
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,266
Scott: Yeah.

310
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:54,279
Scott: Yeah, let's do it With video games maybe even also or anything.

311
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,348
Rym: Yeah video versus two-player games.

312
00:21:57,408 --> 00:21:58,010
Rym: It'd be really good.

313
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:03,730
Scott: Yeah, I just want to be able for us to both stream to a thing and for that thing to stream to the Internet.

314
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:08,305
Rym: Yep, our combined video feeds because then we could play.

315
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:11,258
Rym: we could play some games We could like just play counter-strike do a lot of stuff.

316
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,142
Rym: Yeah on opposite teams.

317
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,790
Scott: Yeah, we got time.

318
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:17,774
Rym: Yeah we're gonna try to make a lot of content and stay tuned as soon as There might.

319
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:25,270
Rym: there will hopefully be a point where even if the world still kind of locked down We can get together the two of us to do like in-person video.

320
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,990
Rym: Because one thing we do want to do at some point is try to make this is warm enough to bite.

321
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:30,710
Rym: Yeah, we can make panels.

322
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:32,814
Rym: Yeah, we can in fact.

323
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,720
Rym: and why they think the one conventions to go to?

324
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:38,635
Scott: we just do panels without the convention and just put The panels on YouTube.

325
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:43,941
Rym: Yep, but we can treat them like a panel which is very different for the way retreat Oh show like and we won't prepare restrictions.

326
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:46,173
Scott: We won't have the restrictions on time We won't have.

327
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:48,830
Rym: we should still force ourselves to go no more than an hour.

328
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:49,213
Rym: I think.

329
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,009
Scott: well, I mean I was thinking that we can do less than it.

330
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,529
Rym: Oh, yeah, we can do an hour.

331
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:55,930
Rym: We can do like we used to do at PAX is those 20-minute panels, which I love.

332
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:59,410
Scott: We don't have to fill an hour and we can do whatever fucking topic we want.

333
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,285
Scott: It doesn't have to fit the convention and no one approves or rejects it.

334
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:06,246
Rym: We just do what we want Yep, and then you know what I'm gonna do once we.

335
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:06,970
Rym: once we do this.

336
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:08,077
Rym: I want to send them to.

337
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:09,165
Rym: like y'all get all the packs.

338
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:12,923
Rym: people be like look These are the panels that you have been rejecting all these years.

339
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:15,796
Rym: when you want us to do the 40 games You must play for the eighth time.

340
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:18,570
Scott: I could also like do some on my own or you know.

341
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:20,818
Scott: So yeah, I'll probably still.

342
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,663
Scott: I'll still make slides.

343
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:26,510
Rym: Yep, but the main thing I'm gonna say it out loud on the show because I'm it's gonna force me to do it.

344
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:32,489
Rym: My goal this weekend is to be able to stream with multiple camera angles myself playing DDR.

345
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,689
Rym: Okay, I'm just gonna do DDR live streams.

346
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:41,067
Rym: I got an idea how to do it and I'm gonna try it out and we'll see how it goes cuz.

347
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:46,928
Rym: uh If I'm stuck inside for this long and it's gonna be like shitty and rainy all weekend I think I'm just playing DDR every day.

348
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,650
Rym: Hmm the book club book is still the tale of Genji not the tale of Hanzo.

349
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:54,744
Rym: We don't have a commute not pooping at work anymore.

350
00:23:54,804 --> 00:24:04,037
Rym: So I don't really have like Time to sit and read because as much as I could read I've actually been reading but I've been reading comics Which I didn't read as much.

351
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:07,567
Rym: Yeah before I am also reading a comic that we'll do a show on next week.

352
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:21,866
Rym: Oh good Yeah But I'm mostly playing video games and working out every video game season right now Like the other thing I'm doing this weekend and I'm not streaming it because Even my god computer cannot do VR in high quality and stream at the same time.

353
00:24:21,886 --> 00:24:23,170
Scott: You got to use daddy to computer.

354
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,528
Rym: Yep I could use one computer if I turn the settings down but fuck that.

355
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:30,930
Scott: Use one computer and the other computer has a capture card and does that right?

356
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,283
Rym: Yeah, but then that's tricky with VR for a bunch of reasons.

357
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:35,287
Rym: I don't want to get into right now.

358
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:41,947
Rym: But yeah, it's doable It's just it's a pain in the ass But I'm gonna play through half-life Alex because every review says it's great.

359
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,033
Scott: Yeah Any official.

360
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:54,010
Rym: there was the one review of someone who played the whole game in one weekend and they were having hallucinations for weeks afterward Like real-world hallucinations from the VR world.

361
00:24:56,092 --> 00:25:03,949
Rym: Yeah, I feel like that edges into what happened to us when we first learned DDR And we'd like have those dreams of arrows at night like every night for weeks.

362
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:08,319
Rym: So, yeah insurance.

363
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:11,329
Rym: we don't know much about insurance, but we got opinions on it.

364
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:14,023
Scott: Yeah, we're not actuaries, right?

365
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:15,390
Scott: We're not in the insurance industry.

366
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:23,137
Scott: I know high-level stuff, but I think a lot of people just in general especially kids who don't learn this You know, no one ever taught me in school.

367
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:28,089
Scott: So I presume no one else is learning in school like What insurance is how?

368
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:33,166
Rym: Anything like and even I need a lot of people who are adults like where there is like.

369
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:34,110
Rym: some insurance is stupid.

370
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,177
Rym: Some insurance is bad.

371
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:42,787
Rym: some insurance would be good But due to the lack of regulation or the lack of social safety nets is broken in some fundamental way.

372
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:50,167
Rym: some insurance however is so cheap and so worth it and yet there are a lot of adults who don't buy it.

373
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:57,087
Rym: like Imagine paying four dollars a month and you don't have to worry about like literally anything happening in your apartment Like you're just fine, right?

374
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,037
Scott: So fundamentally what insurance is is gambling.

375
00:26:00,197 --> 00:26:05,110
Scott: you're betting right and there is some company that is betting the opposite of.

376
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:08,041
Scott: You know what you're betting right.

377
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,630
Scott: so it's like a casino, right?

378
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:16,669
Scott: I bet the dice the roulette wheel is gonna come on zero zero and the casino is like I will definitely bet the opposite of that.

379
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,438
Rym: But it's not quite gambling because there is a much more.

380
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,990
Rym: a big component of insurance is the idea that you're distributing risk.

381
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:29,050
Rym: The person who is providing insurance isn't directly betting that you yourself will not need to use the insurance.

382
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,440
Rym: They're using data to show that.

383
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,250
Rym: alright if we sell it to end people Odds are only n minus X people will need to use the insurance.

384
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:42,468
Rym: So if we charge this much we can make a guaranteed profit of X?

385
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:52,608
Rym: Well, I guess not X because I used X. we can make a guaranteed profit of Z while also providing insurance to all these people and being able to pay out anyone who has a problem.

386
00:26:53,089 --> 00:27:02,290
Rym: and then Often those insurance companies will then get another insurance company to cover what might happen if suddenly Everybody needs a pad all at once for some reason, right?

387
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:07,542
Scott: So for example, let's say I have a you know You're betting that something bad will happen to you.

388
00:27:07,863 --> 00:27:13,600
Scott: right and in that way I'm placing that bet if nothing bad happens to you.

389
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,390
Scott: Well, you lost some money, but nothing bad happened to you.

390
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,700
Scott: Yeah, okay, but also bad.

391
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:31,469
Scott: if the bad thing does happen Someone is gonna take a bunch of use a bunch of money and take corrective action To fix as much as possible the bad thing that happened to you.

392
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,230
Rym: Yeah, well like you broke your arm in Australia and you had trip insurance.

393
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:37,398
Rym: Mmm, I mean Australia has good health care.

394
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:45,870
Rym: So it wasn't that important but still the insurance was like, alright Here's a giant pain in the ass is gonna happen to you and we are obligated by law to throw money at that problem.

395
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:51,470
Scott: So let's say there's a risk you have in your life, you know, I'm going on a vacation.

396
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,564
Scott: There's a bunch of risks involved with going on a vacation.

397
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,010
Scott: What if I lose my luggage?

398
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,038
Rym: Yeah, what if I get sick and can't go?

399
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,143
Rym: what if?

400
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:00,750
Rym: what if I get trapped?

401
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,981
Rym: What if the player line shuts down while I'm there right?

402
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:06,550
Scott: There's so many things that can go wrong on a vacation, right?

403
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:15,067
Scott: So the insurance company is like they don't come to me like Scott and say hmm Scott We're gonna bet your vacations gonna go wrong because that would just be gambling for both of us.

404
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:15,670
Scott: Like who knows?

405
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,324
Scott: Yeah, they're not gonna make that bet but they do know.

406
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:20,234
Scott: aha All right.

407
00:28:20,254 --> 00:28:29,610
Scott: Well with this list of things that can go wrong on a vacation What are the odds, you know, what percentage of people who go on vacation have one of these things happen to them, right?

408
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:37,458
Scott: So it's like okay of a million people go on vacation 1% of them lose their luggage an average.

409
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:43,012
Scott: it cost them about this much money to replace the lost luggage and solve their problem Right.

410
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:47,930
Scott: So we want to charge them less than that amount individually, right?

411
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:48,653
Scott: No one wants to.

412
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:53,032
Scott: because if you if the purse individual person has to pay that amount to replace their luggage Well, it's like.

413
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:53,594
Scott: well, why did I?

414
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:54,798
Scott: I'm not gambling?

415
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,930
Scott: because I could just save that money and fix the problem myself with the money.

416
00:28:58,131 --> 00:29:00,693
Rym: Yep, right like one way Mitigation.

417
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:10,010
Rym: one way to mitigate risk is if I'm going on a trip I could set aside $40,000 as my emergency fund and not touch it till I get home from the vacation, right exactly.

418
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:14,250
Scott: So you they need to figure out okay, how many people will have the problem?

419
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,810
Scott: How much is it gonna cost on average?

420
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:22,330
Scott: Yeah And then can we charge a large number of people a small amount of money?

421
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,970
Scott: Less than the amount it costs to fix the problem for one of the people, right?

422
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:33,700
Scott: Every individual person who's paying for the insurance is paying less than what it would cost to fix the problem for themselves.

423
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:42,316
Scott: But total you add up all the little bits of money from all the people and you say, alright well all those little bits of money from all the people.

424
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:46,290
Scott: only this percentage of people have the problem and that'll so and we can.

425
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:49,470
Scott: So we lose that money to fix people's problems.

426
00:29:50,012 --> 00:30:02,190
Scott: But there's still money left over because so many people signed up for it and such a small percentage had the problem And we figured out exactly how much to charge where they're actuarial mess that we the insurance company make a bunch of money

427
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:15,010
Rym: And even better they often because if it's a large insurance company They cannot use that data and use their Operational efficiency to make it cheaper for them to handle that kind of problem than any individual person could make it.

428
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:18,542
Rym: so like they might have a relationship like a travel insurance company.

429
00:30:18,924 --> 00:30:35,884
Rym: a real one a good one probably has Relationships with most of the major airlines and they can like cut deals Like if you cancel your trip they work at work with Delta or whatever to put give those tickets to someone else and They actually cost them less to deal with the problem that it would cost you on your own.

430
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:41,110
Rym: talking to the airline or the airline On their own without an insurance company managing this risk pool, right?

431
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,970
Scott: You the negotiating power of one person is pretty weak against a giant airline, right?

432
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,950
Scott: You go to the airline and something bad happens, right and you don't have insurance.

433
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:49,140
Scott: So you just go and fight with them.

434
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,230
Scott: You're like, I want the money back.

435
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:52,673
Scott: They're like no Deal with it.

436
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:54,538
Scott: Yeah, you signed up for this flight.

437
00:30:54,578 --> 00:31:02,130
Scott: you you know, whatever right but the travel insurance company is like We have this many customers, right?

438
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:05,997
Scott: We can you know, we have Bargaining clout with you.

439
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:08,185
Scott: We're also a big company with a shit ton of money.

440
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:14,130
Scott: Yeah, right airline You better do this for our customers and it's like oh, okay.

441
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:24,650
Scott: So that means you know the cost to reschedule my flight on my own would be a thousand dollars But the insurance company has a with their bargaining power and negotiated the airline down.

442
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:33,729
Scott: It's only five hundred dollars and I'm indirectly benefiting from that Discount bargaining power because the insurance company is taking care of the biz for me.

443
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,998
Scott: Yeah I don't have to go in and negotiate with the airline myself.

444
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:45,383
Rym: now on a high level the idea of distributed risk and insurance Is like yeah, I don't know how many of you might be stupid libertarians or something.

445
00:31:45,623 --> 00:31:47,890
Rym: It is a necessary part of modern society.

446
00:31:47,970 --> 00:32:01,570
Rym: There is a reason insurance the concept of insurance has existed for a long long time but at the same time We use insurance for a lot of things We really should be using something else for like for example health care.

447
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:08,370
Rym: the fact that you have to have health insurance is ridiculous because Some kinds of insurance are purely optional.

448
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,910
Rym: Like do I want to pay the seven dollars for insurance on my Amtrak to Rochester?

449
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,470
Rym: Or do I my willing to eat the possibility that I might have to deal with some trouble on this trip?

450
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:17,711
Rym: Like.

451
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:22,169
Rym: that's a reasonable cost-benefit analysis that a person could make to decide if it's worth it.

452
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:28,070
Rym: But no one should have to decide whether or not I think I'm gonna get sick in the next ten years.

453
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:29,734
Scott: Yeah, that's not a thing.

454
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:30,939
Scott: You should be betting on.

455
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:33,870
Scott: that's just a risk that should be eliminated completely.

456
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,237
Rym: Yeah, insurance gonna happen.

457
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:41,870
Rym: insurance should be one means of eliminating risk But we should not use it as the sole means of eliminating or mitigating risk.

458
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:55,712
Scott: Well, I mean assurance is is best for things that will affect a small number of people right but could potentially Inflict a large number of people or likely or for things They're all.

459
00:32:55,832 --> 00:33:07,190
Rym: insurance is also good for things where an adult of sound minds can reasonably be expected to make a decision About whether or not they need this protection or are willing to assume that risk.

460
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:09,518
Rym: Like there are some risks that we allowed.

461
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:13,250
Rym: people like I I ski I am allowed to assume the risk of skiing.

462
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:28,330
Scott: I am not allowed to assume the risk of fighting in a gladiatorial deathmatch Mm-hmm, except unless I'm on the barge Right, but the point is is that you know Even dangerous dangerous skiing a large percentage of the people who ski don't get hurt at all.

463
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:34,029
Scott: Yeah but I but I can everyone who skis put in a little bit of money to cover the people who did get hurt skiing.

464
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:42,490
Scott: the People who didn't get hurt wouldn't be losing that much and they would gain peace of mind Knowing that if they fell off the ski lift, they would be taken care of with money.

465
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:46,870
Rym: The problem is what actually covers that is just people's health insurance.

466
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:52,010
Rym: But there is a sort of form of interesting a hypothetical ski insurance.

467
00:33:52,050 --> 00:34:00,197
Rym: But you're closer to the mark than you realize because there is an implicit built-in ski insurance and especially at resorts And that is ski patrol.

468
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:03,010
Rym: because basically to ski you need a lift ticket.

469
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,349
Rym: That's the thing that allows you to go up the lift.

470
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:08,630
Rym: A lot of resorts like you can hike up the mountain if you want then, you know what I got.

471
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:14,379
Rym: You don't gotta pay or you gotta pay like 10 bucks for like a mountain pass But it takes all day to hike up the mountain.

472
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,429
Rym: you ski down once now the sun's down you're done.

473
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:17,708
Rym: So you pay for the lift ticket?

474
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,690
Rym: The lift ticket doesn't just pay for like all the staff of the resort to make things work and all that stuff.

475
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,661
Rym: It also pays for the support structures around ski patrol.

476
00:34:28,342 --> 00:34:33,458
Rym: and ski patrol are the people who are basically skiing all day But they're also EMTs and experts.

477
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:38,897
Rym: They're the ones who will save you if you hurt yourself on the mountain And so effectively.

478
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,630
Rym: and it's not just your lift ticket fees that pay for that.

479
00:34:41,730 --> 00:35:05,450
Rym: it's also a lot of skiers when they get older volunteer to be ski patrol to sort of like pay it forward and you basically have The system where if you go to any modern ski resort like anywhere in the world There will be people who will not charge you any money and will basically do everything they can to save you if you hurt yourself Or have a problem on the mountain, so we all pay in and then we all reduce our risk for everybody, right?

480
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:12,775
Scott: But the point I was trying to make is that with the ski the theoretical ski insurance a lot of people never get Never file a claim.

481
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:14,300
Scott: Yeah, never get paid out like look.

482
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,370
Rym: I've been skiing for about 20 years, but I have health insurance.

483
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:19,119
Rym: I've had two series.

484
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,050
Scott: everyone gets paid out on health insurance.

485
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,181
Scott: You are going you're a human being you're mortal.

486
00:35:23,784 --> 00:35:28,750
Scott: in some time in your life Every single person is going to be need to get paid out, right?

487
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:37,675
Scott: So insurance is a good model for something where a small percentage of people in the in the pool Ever make a claim.

488
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:45,648
Scott: if you have an insurance and everyone is posting is making a claim at some point That's not a thing that we should be using insurance to help out with.

489
00:35:45,808 --> 00:35:49,938
Rym: yeah exactly Which ties back into that idea that it can't.

490
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:55,118
Rym: it has to be something that a person can reasonably Choose to accept that risk.

491
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,974
Rym: and if we don't let me fight in a gladiatorial arena We wouldn't let.

492
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,099
Rym: we shouldn't let me decide.

493
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,253
Rym: I don't ever need to go to a doctor in my entire life Right?

494
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:06,830
Scott: so some other things you know insurance from like the non.

495
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:11,744
Scott: There's a consurances that people don't see when they're not a can because they're only consumers.

496
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:12,587
Scott: right you're consumer.

497
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:12,887
Scott: you see.

498
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:13,750
Scott: car insurance?

499
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,397
Scott: Yeah, right.

500
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:17,269
Rym: renters insurance homeowners insurance.

501
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,099
Scott: Right travelers insurance.

502
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,210
Scott: We just talked about pet insurance recently.

503
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:36,437
Rym: Yeah, my work started offering it, but then there's like like packs like conventions venue insurance event insurance There's all this like back-end insurance that has to exist for a lot of the things you do in your life to even be offered As services right.

504
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:37,099
Scott: so it's like all right.

505
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,047
Scott: I want to start a. you know a business.

506
00:36:39,248 --> 00:36:39,890
Scott: What's your business?

507
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,145
Scott: I don't know a grocery store all right well I need insurance that is going to cover right.

508
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:52,629
Scott: if Someone eats food in my store and gets sick and tries to sue me right which you're right Then I need this insurance to help me out.

509
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,699
Scott: Yeah, to sort of cover my ass

510
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:05,688
Rym: like I was you know happen like you know my last job Ibo's effectively like I did a lot of our risk assessment and one of the things I had to review was all the different kinds of insurance we have for some sock audits and things.

511
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:16,867
Rym: and Like even a tiny company that has like 30 or 40 employees We had like five different types of insurance to cover all the kinds of crap that can happen in the kind of industry we were working in.

512
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:22,150
Scott: and Because if any one of those five things happened, and you didn't have the insurance you would be boned yep.

513
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:29,878
Rym: And it gets complicated like there's this concept of umbrella insurance and even like a tiny business like GeekNights We could get umbrella insurance.

514
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:39,090
Rym: It's basically insurance that covers Anything fucky that could happen that isn't specifically excluded and or specifically usually covered by other kinds of insurance.

515
00:37:39,711 --> 00:37:43,220
Rym: But then you get specific stuff like indemnity insurance or like.

516
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:46,007
Rym: you can get insurance against what if some?

517
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:46,890
Rym: what if an engineer?

518
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:53,175
Rym: Pirate some code like steal some source code and puts it in your product and like no one noticed And then you get sued.

519
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:57,370
Rym: you can get insurance for that specific thing All right, and then you just fight.

520
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:57,993
Scott: You know you.

521
00:37:58,073 --> 00:38:01,930
Scott: if you didn't do it on purpose because your company like you know the thing that happened you were car.

522
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,919
Scott: It wasn't your company's actual strategy.

523
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:09,363
Scott: You know where you're supposed to get sued for that Just be like oh oops my bad settle out of court.

524
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:11,050
Scott: the insurance money takes care of it yep.

525
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:19,010
Scott: So I think the insurance that's in that category that most people are aware of is doctors malpractice insurance Yep, which is a form of indemnity insurance.

526
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:26,008
Scott: Yes, it's like you're a doctor And it's like you're doing your best at doctoring and even if you follow all the best things as a doctor.

527
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:39,392
Scott: It's like Medicines messy yep, and you know There's lawyers out there, and there's people who go to the doctor and if their experience isn't perfect They're gonna try to sue the doctor that equivalent exams are right and sometimes They're wrong.

528
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:42,364
Rym: that equivalent exists for everything like one of the other one.

529
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:42,785
Rym: I remember.

530
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:45,078
Rym: I'm just looking at like old emails I said to remember the stuff.

531
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:46,386
Rym: cuz I'm not I'm running.

532
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:59,596
Rym: we are getting down to the depths of what I know about insurance, but Errors and omissions insurance is pretty fun too because that's basically the yeah if we fuck something up like sorry We're good work.

533
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,530
Rym: It's not our big talk to those guys.

534
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,212
Rym: They'll pay for it.

535
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:06,770
Scott: the most fascinating insurance that I'm aware of is prize insurance, right?

536
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:13,070
Scott: So let's say you want to run a contest or like a game show and you have like some huge jackpot or something right?

537
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,001
Scott: But it's sometimes you have a guaranteed jackpot.

538
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,070
Scott: That's like someone's gonna win the jackpot.

539
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:20,507
Scott: It's these odds and you have some way to pay for it.

540
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:23,599
Scott: But sometimes it's like you say you're running.

541
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:24,061
Scott: I don't know.

542
00:39:24,102 --> 00:39:25,146
Scott: freaking jeopardy.

543
00:39:25,186 --> 00:39:26,050
Scott: the TV show right.

544
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:30,724
Scott: It's like most people per episode are only winning like thousands of dollars.

545
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:30,944
Scott: right?

546
00:39:30,964 --> 00:39:32,910
Scott: you're a big TV show with big sponsors.

547
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:33,976
Scott: You can pay for that.

548
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:42,285
Scott: It's not a big deal right, but if you have like Small chance of the jackpot that could happen, but hardly ever happens probably won't happen right?

549
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:46,442
Scott: you can get insurance Prize insurance right.

550
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:50,126
Scott: a good example would be that Who wants to be a millionaire show?

551
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:50,186
Scott: no?

552
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,724
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that show had insurance in case someone became a millionaire.

553
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:59,065
Scott: right because most Contestants weren't gonna win a million dollars.

554
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:01,637
Scott: most contestants We're just gonna win thousands or less.

555
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,283
Rym: and it's still not really super gambling.

556
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:04,326
Rym: because think about how that would work.

557
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:13,310
Rym: the company that would Issue insurance to a game show like that would issue it to a lot of game shows Right and it also it wouldn't necessarily be the cheapest insurance.

558
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,937
Scott: Yeah They would do the math and figure you can like that's.

559
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:17,723
Rym: that's manually under written insurance.

560
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:19,610
Rym: if you want to ensure something weird like what?

561
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,132
Rym: Was that thing?

562
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:24,290
Rym: we're gonna put this diamond on the front of an f1 car as a stone.

563
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:29,230
Scott: Have you ever seen if you ever read the Mongo or watch the anime master Keaton?

564
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:30,713
Scott: Where he's?

565
00:40:30,873 --> 00:40:32,137
Scott: he's an insurance inspect.

566
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:33,420
Rym: also try gun fruit.

567
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:36,369
Rym: Yeah, try gun and master Keaton are about the same thing.

568
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,030
Scott: All right, they're my insurance inspector.

569
00:40:39,452 --> 00:40:41,630
Scott: He's working for Lloyd's of London, right?

570
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:48,450
Scott: So someone filed an insurance claim and he goes out to make sure it's legit and not insurance fraud of some kind.

571
00:40:49,211 --> 00:41:00,610
Scott: Right and he ends up in crazy situations because these aren't normal everyday insurance claims Like big-deal crazy insurance claims, I'm like a famous painting got stolen or all, you know all kinds of nonsense.

572
00:41:00,913 --> 00:41:13,549
Rym: So other than health insurance Which is a topic that is way Beyond the scope of what we want to talk about in this show The insurance that I'm I've always been the most mad about in my entire life But for a lot of kind of complicated reasons is car insurance.

573
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:19,750
Rym: That's the one I'm mad about because I'm what and it the rent Scott and I would talk about this a lot at RIT.

574
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:24,849
Scott: Well when cars mattered more and we had less money to pay for insurance, yeah, I couldn't afford.

575
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:26,047
Scott: now I don't have to pay car insurance.

576
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:27,697
Scott: now I just don't have a car that has everything.

577
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:32,280
Rym: and I just had like PLPD like I had the shittiest Possible insurance I could like.

578
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,089
Rym: that was I was allowed to get on my car.

579
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:39,090
Rym: But when it came to comes down to the reason I'm mad about car insurance, is that one?

580
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:49,310
Rym: The fact that you can cause so much damage with a car to other things around you You should have to have some insurance to cover the damage you might cause.

581
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,497
Rym: Like I feel like that's me recursively.

582
00:41:52,557 --> 00:42:01,690
Scott: I think we shouldn't require car insurance, but I also think that You shouldn't be allowed to drive unless you're like a fucking super expert incredible driver.

583
00:42:01,793 --> 00:42:02,248
Rym: Well, let's get it.

584
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:13,951
Scott: Also, if you I also believe that if you fuck up driving even once even if you small fuck up driving I'm talking like you're driving and there's a red light and your car goes over the white line a little bit because you weren't perfect at Driving.

585
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:15,376
Scott: banned from driving forever.

586
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:17,643
Rym: You would be banned from driving then sure.

587
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:18,506
Scott: That's fine.

588
00:42:18,546 --> 00:42:19,590
Scott: Not a super expert driver.

589
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:29,712
Scott: And also, I think that if you are caught driving when you're not supposed to like you got banned from driving forever and you drive jail Fuck you.

590
00:42:30,374 --> 00:42:33,142
Rym: See I'm thinking more along the lines of the problem I have with car insurance.

591
00:42:33,243 --> 00:42:35,710
Rym: Was that all car accidents?

592
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,990
Rym: Like well, ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of them.

593
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:49,929
Rym: There's a tiny tiny like vanishingly small percentage of car accidents that are caused by Flukes of nature or you know force majeure Like a tree falls on your car.

594
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:55,770
Rym: Yeah Like a tree that had no outward problems in clear sunny weather just like fucking falls over on your car while you're driving.

595
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:56,661
Rym: What are you gonna do right?

596
00:42:56,681 --> 00:43:02,910
Scott: You're right You're driving down the road and something literally like just shoots out into the road from the side.

597
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,721
Scott: Yeah, dear, but and you there's no way you could have seen it is impossible Yeah, and you weren't even speeding or anything.

598
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:09,030
Rym: but most car accidents.

599
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:10,193
Rym: It is there.

600
00:43:10,313 --> 00:43:15,426
Rym: it is very clear that one of the drivers caused that accident due to negligence.

601
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:23,481
Rym: like exactly all the time There's almost always the negligent party and what I was always mad about as a kid Was I was in Michigan and I had to.

602
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:28,244
Rym: I got my first car and I got car insurance And I learned about the concept of no fault insurance.

603
00:43:28,646 --> 00:43:38,316
Rym: on one hand It's good and that it prevents a situation where everybody's suing everyone all the time every time there's a car accident But on the other hand it removes

604
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:38,517
Scott: the

605
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:51,970
Rym: punishment or the it removes a way to punish or otherwise Force the consequences of a poor decision out of the person who made that poor decision Like someone who's a shitty driver and causes accidents.

606
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:58,450
Rym: The only consequence to them really if they don't die in a car accident is that their insurance slowly costs more over time.

607
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:04,630
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is that the whole car situation breaks into too many social justice areas.

608
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,882
Scott: It's like oh, we're gonna start punishing drivers the way Scott just said.

609
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:09,990
Scott: Okay, all the black people going to jail?

610
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,497
Scott: Yeah like there's not or even just can't.

611
00:44:11,557 --> 00:44:22,526
Rym: what about like old people and people who have Disabilities where the car is the only way to get around because there's literally only one city Episode that's now insurance because there's only one city in America that has real mass transit.

612
00:44:22,566 --> 00:44:23,762
Rym: We happen to live in it like.

613
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:24,895
Rym: But I'm just.

614
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:31,970
Rym: I was mad as a kid about the fact that car Insurance did not force the person who was at fault to pay for all the damages.

615
00:44:32,553 --> 00:44:35,470
Rym: Yeah, I mean or at least cause their insurance to pay for all the damages.

616
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:40,510
Rym: I didn't want my insurance to have to pay for someone else's damages if they hit me from behind.

617
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:41,976
Rym: That's what I was mad about.

618
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:45,210
Scott: It's it's a it's a. it's a double miscarriage of justice, right?

619
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:54,107
Scott: On the one hand if we always correctly punish the person who's bad at driving Right, we will then cause because our society is car, right?

620
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,600
Scott: Unless we fix that by winning the war on cars because we'll

621
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,523
Rym: partly punish we

622
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:12,270
Scott: think right unless we win the war on cars then as long right as long as you have a car culture if we if we Justifiably punish anyone who fucks up at driving that will be a miscarriage of social justice.

623
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:15,995
Rym: Yep, like for example, we want everyone to be good We have to get rid of cars.

624
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:20,734
Rym: most people in America even I mean a lot of people are bad drivers Even though there's no excuse.

625
00:45:20,814 --> 00:45:26,129
Rym: like a a lot of people got real driver's ed and learned how to drive They're just shitty drivers.

626
00:45:26,512 --> 00:45:30,590
Rym: But there's also a lot of people who probably just didn't have access to good driver's ed.

627
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:34,410
Rym: Like if you go to a shitty school, it'll hurt like in the middle of nowhere.

628
00:45:34,913 --> 00:45:36,119
Rym: How are you gonna learn how to drive?

629
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:38,069
Rym: Well, like how do you have time for that?

630
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:41,704
Rym: Yeah, but you still need to drive much going on with the car department.

631
00:45:41,724 --> 00:45:44,415
Scott: Yeah, I'm at the insurance department Yeah, but I was mad.

632
00:45:44,595 --> 00:46:01,003
Rym: the thing I was mad about and I'm still kind of mad about it is the lack of significant consequences for the people who cause damage with their cars and the fact that Everyone has to have insurance and we kind of just paper it over by just having you know fault insurance and kind of.

633
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:10,790
Scott: Anyway, so the the last insurance I want to talk about are these Insurances that I've looked into frequently, but never actually purchased.

634
00:46:11,757 --> 00:46:16,022
Scott: And so these are basically these niche Insurances for like specialties, right?

635
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:17,490
Scott: So I looked at bicycle insurance.

636
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:23,190
Scott: I've looked at camera insurance because our cameras aren't like mega expensive, but they're not mega cheap either.

637
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:26,710
Rym: I paid for the insurance for my camera and that paid out dividend.

638
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:30,950
Scott: You're just talking about the be like the warranty stuff, right?

639
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,972
Scott: Yeah I'm talking about like an actual insurance plan with a premium that you keep paying yearly.

640
00:46:36,072 --> 00:46:41,368
Rym: I did look into one of those and the reason I didn't do it was very specific the cost of the like.

641
00:46:41,388 --> 00:46:42,790
Rym: I Forget what it was called.

642
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,470
Rym: It wasn't because they had like a studio one for I forget even who I looked at.

643
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,148
Rym: This was years ago.

644
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:54,630
Rym: If you have a studio and your cameras tend to stay in the studio You can get a pretty cheap insurance that'll cover any accidents that happen to the cameras in the studio.

645
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:58,745
Rym: But if you're carrying the camera around outside the studio, they wouldn't cover it.

646
00:46:58,785 --> 00:47:00,110
Rym: You have to go get a different kind of insurance.

647
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:06,710
Scott: Yeah, yeah But I'm saying like these are specialty insurances for special kinds of expensive stuff you might have.

648
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:10,201
Scott: Right, and the thing is it's like I kind of want bike insurance.

649
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:11,064
Scott: I'm in New York City.

650
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:12,990
Scott: My bikes aren't mega expensive.

651
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:15,079
Scott: I've seen you know, but they're not super.

652
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:17,690
Rym: but my renters insurance covers that my bike.

653
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:20,138
Scott: It covers some things but doesn't cover everything.

654
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:21,523
Rym: if my bike stolen it covers it.

655
00:47:21,563 --> 00:47:23,650
Rym: That's really the only thing I'm actually worried about.

656
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:28,125
Scott: Sometimes depends on the exact circumstances and such right.

657
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:32,210
Scott: but You know, so I was like, hey, why don't I get some extra bike insurance?

658
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:35,625
Scott: That way I can like lock my bike up outside without even giving a shit.

659
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,859
Rym: Ah, yeah Cuz that's you know, we didn't talk about this in the beginning.

660
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:44,389
Rym: That's it's not just that you're mitigating your risk It's also that now it's something you don't have to worry about it.

661
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,450
Scott: Right the people who buy insurance who don't file a claim are buying peace of mind.

662
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:53,032
Scott: Yep, so I was trying to buy peace of mind to say oh if my bike gets stolen Whatever.

663
00:47:53,153 --> 00:48:00,754
Scott: Yeah, and because there were because normally if you get like I claimed on renters insurance once they give you the current value of The stuff you lost.

664
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,899
Scott: so I had an old TV.

665
00:48:01,919 --> 00:48:02,442
Scott: It's like alright.

666
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,290
Scott: Well, here's what the old TV is worth.

667
00:48:04,913 --> 00:48:07,770
Scott: You can't necessarily buy that same TV with that money.

668
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:14,529
Scott: Yeah I've seen bike insurances that will give you what it costs to buy that bike when you bought it.

669
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:17,198
Scott: So you would get your bike when it was new.

670
00:48:17,258 --> 00:48:20,690
Scott: you would not get like oh some depreciated value amount of money.

671
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:25,110
Rym: But doesn't that create a perverse incentive to trash your own bike to get a new one?

672
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,309
Scott: You don't commit insurance fraud or else the master Keaton will come after ya.

673
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:32,547
Scott: but anyway, so I looked at that insurance and it was actually a good deal.

674
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:47,026
Scott: if You were professional and you had super expensive bikes and you raced bikes my level of bike is like too Expensive to leave on the street but not expensive enough to be worth buying insurance.

675
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:48,450
Scott: the same thing for my cameras, right?

676
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:51,250
Scott: I'm not a TV station with a pile of expensive cameras.

677
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:52,035
Scott: I have it like.

678
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,390
Scott: I have more expensive cameras than the average person.

679
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:57,463
Scott: So the camera insurance wasn't quite worth it.

680
00:48:57,544 --> 00:48:58,910
Scott: The premiums are too high.

681
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:06,563
Rym: Yeah, my my most expensive camera is like three grand like okay that is not expensive by professional camera standards at all.

682
00:49:07,105 --> 00:49:17,370
Rym: and to like the Warranty insurance like the what do you bought it on Amazon like paying the hundred bucks or whatever was Way cheaper than the premiums on camera insurance, right?

683
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:28,810
Scott: so that while the insurance company would be happy to have me join the insurance pool and help them pay for When a TV studio loses all its cameras and an earthquake you wouldn't get much out of it, right?

684
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:39,518
Scott: Yeah, if I had to file a claim it's like well I could have just taken the money I spent on premiums put it in a savings account even with no interest and Been able to buy all new camera stuff, right?

685
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:49,874
Scott: So the premiums you're paying have to be small enough That you're pert that they're less than the amount of stuff you're protecting the only exotic insurance I ever actually got.

686
00:49:49,914 --> 00:49:50,718
Rym: but my parents got it.

687
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:51,802
Rym: I didn't get it as a kid.

688
00:49:52,324 --> 00:50:00,643
Rym: I actually had an insurance policy specific to my fancy trumpet Mm-hmm because that was at the until I bought a car.

689
00:50:00,703 --> 00:50:02,970
Rym: that was the most expensive really cheap insurance though.

690
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:03,954
Rym: Oh, yeah, it was.

691
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:06,784
Rym: the premiums were like $15 a year.

692
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:06,884
Scott: Yeah.

693
00:50:07,346 --> 00:50:13,481
Rym: Yeah one of those It insured up to like $5,000 worth of trumpet related damages.

694
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:15,790
Scott: Yeah, I've seen a lot of musical instrument insurance.

695
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:24,171
Scott: It's especially because you know, some people have like, you know, not only is the musical instrument like their life leehood But it's irreplaceable Right.

696
00:50:24,232 --> 00:50:30,629
Rym: Some of them are irreplaceable and some of them aren't or some of them just I was watching a video recently on like how to repair a damaged violin.

697
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:39,969
Rym: basically, the answer is there's a handful of people who are extremely skilled and cost basically an infinite amount of Money to even talk to right.

698
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,270
Scott: So if you have a violin that needs one of those people you better have insurance.

699
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,257
Scott: You'll pay for one of those people or be rich.

700
00:50:45,498 --> 00:50:47,545
Scott: Yeah, even if you're rich the insurance can make sense.

701
00:50:47,606 --> 00:50:48,649
Scott: Yeah, right.

702
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:54,930
Scott: Yeah, I guess the last insurance that people think about that's a little different is life insurance.

703
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,288
Rym: Yep, I've got some life insurance.

704
00:50:57,853 --> 00:51:00,369
Rym: That's that's peace of mind for the people around you.

705
00:51:00,993 --> 00:51:03,450
Rym: But I don't want to get too deep into the weeds on this like right.

706
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:11,129
Scott: The only thing with life insurance that makes it weird right is that you buy life insurance on Yourself, right?

707
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:15,810
Scott: So normally all these other insurances you're paying to cancel out your own risk.

708
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:18,302
Scott: And then when you file a claim you get money.

709
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:27,597
Scott: with life insurance you're buying it you're betting that you will die and The payout goes to someone else.

710
00:51:27,637 --> 00:51:31,309
Scott: You're protecting someone else's risk in the case that something happens to you.

711
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:33,157
Scott: No one else's.

712
00:51:33,197 --> 00:51:35,670
Scott: I'm not you know, you're not buying life insurance on me.

713
