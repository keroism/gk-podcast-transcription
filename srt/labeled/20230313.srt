1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,158
Rym: It's Monday, March 13th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:09,460
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:12,806
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,495
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:18,448
Rym: Tonight we are talking about e-waste and old tech and what to do about it.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,568
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,350
Rym: So yeah, there wasn't GeekNights last week because I was in London for work doing a bunch of stuff.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:26,989
Scott: Going to London.

9
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:35,648
Rym: It's, uh, I do post that Snatch GIF in the internal chat every time I have to go to London.

10
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:36,390
Rym: It's kind of a thing.

11
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:39,850
Scott: I mean, if I went to London, I would post it also.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:47,630
Rym: And every time, nobody has any idea what it's referencing and I have to explain it over and over again.

13
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,699
Rym: Nobody's seen Snatch.

14
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:49,850
Rym: Nobody knows that movie.

15
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:52,966
Rym: I don't know how, but that's how it is.

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,703
Rym: But it's an interesting time in London.

17
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:56,910
Rym: I went to a conference.

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,518
Rym: The con was as big as pre-COVID times.

19
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,129
Rym: It was just completely packed and business as usual in London.

20
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:05,310
Scott: Compared to New York.

21
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,557
Rym: So far I seem good.

22
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,410
Rym: I seem fine despite spending a week.

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,669
Scott: I'm feeling a little like I want to go outside because I see the number is in the hundreds instead of the thousands it's been in.

24
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,510
Rym: For a couple of months we've been doing indoor dining, but we avoid places that are crowded.

25
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:26,245
Scott: But I feel like I could just go wherever now.

26
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:36,350
Rym: I went to a multi-thousand person conference and literally zero people masked at this thing at any point.

27
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:43,089
Rym: I gave some talks and so far I seem fine and we have no word of anyone getting COVID from it.

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,930
Rym: So we'll see.

29
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:49,440
Scott: It's clearly far from eliminated.

30
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:51,930
Scott: There's immunocompromised people out there.

31
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:56,430
Scott: There's just one more thing for them to worry about in addition to all the other things.

32
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,090
Rym: Indoor dining you can't wear a mask because you're taking it off to eat.

33
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:07,410
Rym: But I do still wear my mask specifically when I'm on public transport or when I'm in the public areas of an airport.

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,530
Rym: Because the airport feels like there's so many people from so many places the odds are just higher.

35
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,030
Rym: And on the subway the air is actually really shitty down there anyway.

36
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,530
Rym: So wearing an N95 on the New York subway is probably good for you even if you're not worried about COVID.

37
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,950
Scott: It's not like it doesn't cost you anything to wear.

38
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,390
Rym: It's not like I'm talking to strangers on the subway anyway.

39
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,570
Rym: If anything it makes me feel more likely not to talk to me though.

40
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:35,410
Scott: I've been wearing it outside just because it keeps my face warm when it's cold.

41
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,870
Rym: I actually never wore them outside unless I was in a dense crowd at any point.

42
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,449
Scott: Sometimes my face is cold.

43
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:42,880
Rym: I got a beard.

44
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:43,689
Rym: My face never gets cold.

45
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,970
Scott: My face is cold.

46
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,330
Rym: You have the cold sensitivity of a 90 year old and you've had that for as long as I've known you.

47
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,249
Rym: And that has not changed.

48
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:53,630
Scott: It's cold.

49
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,760
Rym: So yeah there's a bunch of news.

50
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,147
Rym: We're not doing a tech news roundup.

51
00:02:59,247 --> 00:02:59,870
Rym: Sorry listener.

52
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,430
Rym: If you have any complaints about the low frequency of our tech news roundups.

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,950
Rym: Well Scott is the dire taskmaster who says I can only do one a year.

54
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,068
Rym: So take it up with him.

55
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,930
Scott: You did two in 2021 which means you took a low nap in 2022.

56
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,670
Rym: That's not the fault of me doing the tech news roundup.

57
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,610
Rym: That is the fault of you the regulator failing to enforce our policies.

58
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,630
Scott: If anything I might not be your fault that you didn't come into work that day.

59
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,268
Scott: But I'm still going to charge you a PTO.

60
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,669
Scott: So you accrued.

61
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,330
Scott: It's been a year since 2022.

62
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,409
Scott: So there is now one roundup accrued.

63
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,406
Rym: We'll do a tech news roundup in April.

64
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:36,890
Rym: It's coming.

65
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,059
Scott: You can just accrue if you just wait until 20, 30 something.

66
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,550
Scott: You'll be able to do a roundup the whole year long if you accrue enough roundups.

67
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,243
Rym: Is Twit even still podcasting?

68
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:52,950
Rym: Did we outlast them?

69
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:53,577
Scott: I think it is.

70
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:54,509
Scott: Yeah I don't know.

71
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:55,074
Rym: Let's see.

72
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:55,969
Rym: I'm going to look it up right now.

73
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,220
Rym: Tech podcast from people you trust.

74
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,065
Rym: This Week in Tech.

75
00:03:59,146 --> 00:03:59,387
Rym: Twit.tv.

76
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,210
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's still around, right?

77
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,190
Rym: What if it even has the same people on it?

78
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,331
Scott: Yeah.

79
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:04,625
Scott: Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.

80
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:05,150
Scott: It's still going.

81
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:09,531
Rym: They started April 17, 2005.

82
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:11,270
Rym: And they're still going at their same rate.

83
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,890
Rym: They only started a couple months before we went public.

84
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,149
Rym: And actually they went public after we started doing GeekNights.

85
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:19,658
Scott: Anyway.

86
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:21,249
Rym: Anyway.

87
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,410
Rym: So a little news before we get into the news.

88
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:29,770
Rym: In New York City, as you know, we have one of the oldest subway networks on Earth.

89
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,770
Rym: We also have the best subway network on Earth.

90
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,510
Rym: And I say this having used the subways in a lot of countries around the world.

91
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,670
Scott: It's like if you look at your scoring rubric, they're not first.

92
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,110
Scott: New York isn't first in every category.

93
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:43,112
Rym: Oh no.

94
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,730
Rym: Cleanliness, we are like near the bottom.

95
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,375
Scott: Train technology.

96
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:51,050
Scott: We are in bad situations in a lot of the places on the scorecard.

97
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,350
Scott: But the total score, we're in first place.

98
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,410
Rym: Because you've got to understand, I've got to remind people.

99
00:04:56,811 --> 00:05:00,010
Rym: Because even in London, people just don't realize this.

100
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,789
Rym: And they think it's insane that we do this.

101
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:04,190
Rym: The New York City subway never stops.

102
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,710
Rym: It runs 24/7.

103
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,272
Rym: And it could be 3

104
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:07,312
Rym: a.m.,

105
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:07,392
Rym: 45 a.m.

106
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:08,376
Rym: on like Christmas Day.

107
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:16,450
Rym: On the least used, shittiest subway line in the city.

108
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,869
Rym: And within 15 minutes, a train's going to come and get you.

109
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,830
Scott: Yeah, and you might say, well, Tokyo's got to be the number one.

110
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,040
Scott: And it's like, oh, it's up there.

111
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:25,009
Scott: It's up there.

112
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,210
Scott: But they've got like five different train companies.

113
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,009
Scott: And you never know which one to use.

114
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:32,710
Scott: I'm sure the people who live there, it's fine, right?

115
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:34,868
Rym: No, the people who live there complain, too.

116
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,850
Rym: And also, the last time we were there, we had a pass to ride a city-run bus.

117
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,110
Rym: And we got on a bus that showed up at the city bus stop around the time we expected the bus.

118
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,870
Rym: But it was some private bus, and then we had to pay because it wasn't covered by the city pass.

119
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:58,590
Rym: So New York City has for a long time been working on new subway cars.

120
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,470
Rym: We talked about it on GeekNights a bunch of times.

121
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,750
Rym: The first of them are on the A train, like the A train in New York.

122
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,890
Rym: If you're lucky, you will be on one of the brand new subway cars in New York City subway.

123
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:15,789
Rym: We have not had new subway cars like this in a long time.

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,770
Scott: Well, I think we have had them.

125
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:23,290
Scott: But what happens is basically, when the MTA gets money, they put an order for subway cars, right?

126
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:30,130
Scott: The subway cars show up, but they don't order enough cars to replace every train in the whole subway system.

127
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:37,230
Rym: Yeah, that alone would cost more than the 10-year budget of most of the rest of the cities in America.

128
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,430
Scott: One train car is over a million dollars, and a train is several of those, right?

129
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:44,606
Scott: It depends on which line it is.

130
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,130
Scott: But what they do is they'll order enough for one line.

131
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:55,790
Scott: And then whichever line has the oldest trains, which right now is the 1 and the A, I think.

132
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:59,950
Rym: The C, I think, actually has the worst trains in the subway.

133
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,999
Scott: Well, A, C, E is all sort of the same.

134
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,149
Scott: The blue ones.

135
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:09,550
Scott: But yeah, they basically replaced, they took the oldest trains out of the blue lines, and they put the newest train in on the blue lines.

136
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:13,009
Scott: And now there'll be a new line that has the oldest train.

137
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,790
Scott: And that one will get the next upgrades whenever that is.

138
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,568
Scott: The coolest part.

139
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:27,810
Scott: The thing is, because of this rolling system, you always have a mix of, like, there's always a line with the oldest trains, there's the lines with the middle-aged trains, and the lines with the new trains.

140
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:43,170
Rym: Also, depending on whether or not which of the ancient subway companies ran the line when it was built, numbers versus letters, with a few weird exceptions, they upgrade on different cycles because their tracks actually have different specifications for what the car's gonna be.

141
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:49,990
Scott: Well, it's like, you know, we talked about Tokyo has different train companies, like New York used to have different train companies, now it has one.

142
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,232
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

143
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:55,690
Rym: One company run by the government way better than a bunch of private companies!

144
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:04,341
Rym: So anyway, these new trains, the biggest deal about them is they reflect the modern needs of New York City.

145
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:10,230
Rym: in that one, they have an open gangway format, meaning they are just one long open train.

146
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:15,710
Rym: There's no more, like, doors between cars, it's just a long train, you can walk anywhere.

147
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:25,190
Scott: Now in the showtime in a car, you can't really avoid it, well you can, you can get away immediately, but the showtime was gonna sort of come through the little gangway.

148
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:40,610
Rym: Now, even worse, in New York, there's a common knowledge, if there is a packed subway, and a train rolls in, and you see that the car that you can get into is pretty empty, there is a reason it is pretty empty.

149
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,729
Rym: There is some dire shit going on in that car.

150
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,250
Scott: Possibly some bardle, or something.

151
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:53,150
Rym: Now, it'll be a dire train, a train's gonna roll in empty, and you're gonna wonder what's up with that train.

152
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:58,889
Scott: I think even in those cases, you could just be in a car far enough away from the direness to...

153
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:13,110
Rym: Yeah, depending on the direness, but the other thing, they've gotten rid of a lot of seats in the format that I like that a lot of the London Underground has, where they have seats that'll come down if you want to sit in them, but they're up by default, which is good for two reasons.

154
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:22,870
Rym: One, this makes way better areas for people in wheelchairs and with other accessibility accommodations to be able to get into the car, like they have a space that's better for them.

155
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:40,250
Rym: And two, the reality is, in most of the subway lines in New York, during a rush hour or a crowded time, you can't really sit anyway, and actually, studies showed if they got rid of those seats, they could cram so many more people in the train than those seats could accommodate.

156
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:44,890
Scott: I think it matters less on the A, but the 6 is the one where they gotta rip the seats out, right?

157
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,432
Rym: Oh, the 7!

158
00:09:45,432 --> 00:09:49,669
Rym: The 7 should not have a single seat, except one special car that is for...

159
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:57,350
Scott: The 7 needs seats, maybe not on the Express 7, but the local 7 needs seats, because that shit is long, and there's a lot of old people riding that, right?

160
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,209
Scott: The 7 almost needs... The Express 7, you could take the seats out.

161
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,890
Rym: The 7 could do a thing, you know what, India has, a lot of the trains in India, what they do is they have, one, they have woman-only cars.

162
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,373
Scott: Isn't that?

163
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:07,890
Scott: where people ride on the outside of the train?

164
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:26,190
Rym: Depending on where you are, but in Mumbai and some of the cities, while that will happen, they'll have woman-only cars, but it's for people who identify as women, and it's mostly because of systemic, extreme assault and harassment issues, but sometimes they will also have cars dedicated for old people only.

165
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:27,789
Rym: Whole car of old people.

166
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,870
Rym: We could have the old person car with the seats, and everybody else, you don't get a seat.

167
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,249
Scott: We should have a bike car.

168
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,608
Rym: We should have a bike car.

169
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,096
Rym: So, yeah, if you live in New York, you can try one of these on the A train.

170
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:49,049
Rym: I will, if I have an opportunity to take the A train, because it would be equivalent to something else, I'm going to try to check out one of these cars, because...

171
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,949
Scott: Yeah, but where do you go that the A goes?

172
00:10:52,390 --> 00:11:00,950
Rym: Nowhere, I guess, coming home from a Rangers game, sometimes the E doesn't run, and then the A to 42nd street is actually the fastest way home.

173
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,590
Scott: And then you would have to swap, though.

174
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,931
Scott: I'm going

175
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:13,890
Rym: to swap to the 7, which I got to walk on the ground, which is a pro in the early part of the hockey season, but is a con in the late part of the hockey season, because it's warm out, and usually I'll take a city bike, so we'll see.

176
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,148
Scott: Why don't you just do what I do and take the F to, you know...

177
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,862
Rym: Well, usually what I do is take the E, which takes me directly home.

178
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:20,630
Rym: It's the literal fastest possible way.

179
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,148
Scott: I feel like the Queensbridge is closer than the...

180
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,930
Rym: Nope, nope, nope, the E. Queensbridge is slightly further away than E, and also the E is so much faster.

181
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:32,510
Scott: The F is pretty fast.

182
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,532
Rym: The F is pretty fast.

183
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:35,257
Rym: E is faster, believe me.

184
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:40,730
Rym: I am 100% sure I would bet my life and my fortune on that.

185
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:42,840
Scott: Anyway...

186
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,694
Rym: Anyway, the big news.

187
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:49,344
Rym: Two banks collapsed for completely unrelated reasons.

188
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:51,589
Rym: One of those banks that collapsed was...

189
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:52,569
Scott: Three banks.

190
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:54,390
Scott: Well, maybe more.

191
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,730
Scott: Only the second one is one that we have to spend time talking about.

192
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,861
Rym: Yeah, and there might be more collapses coming.

193
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,169
Rym: There's a lot going on here, but...

194
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,008
Scott: But it's really just the second one that's a meaningful...

195
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,842
Rym: Yeah, because the first bank that collapsed was some bullshit crypto bank.

196
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:08,450
Rym: Fuck them and fuck everyone who worked with them.

197
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,579
Rym: Like, I just do not care.

198
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:10,748
Rym: The funniest thing...

199
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,043
Scott: They failed because crypto was bad, and they were bad.

200
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:13,708
Scott: It's not really complicated.

201
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:19,864
Rym: So, crypto is up on this news, like, by a lot, and I'm not giving financial advice.

202
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:22,110
Rym: I'm not a registered investment advisor.

203
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,246
Rym: One, I firmly personally believe that Bitcoin and every e-cryptocurrency will go to zero.

204
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,370
Rym: It's a matter of when, not if.

205
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,712
Rym: That's a personal opinion.

206
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:54,750
Rym: But two, they're up partly because people who are, in my personal opinion, extremely stupid... ...are believing that the collapse of these banks means putting your money in crypto would be safer, which is hilarious to a degree that I can't wait for them to lose their money.

207
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:58,590
Rym: Like, I actively want to cyberbully them when they lose their money.

208
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,565
Scott: It's like, these banks... The story here is that the banks are insured, and the crypto is not.

209
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:06,069
Scott: So, it's like, what?

210
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,058
Rym: Nobody who has money in the bank we're about to talk about is losing their money.

211
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,170
Rym: The only people losing anything are the people who invested in the bank itself or were senior executives at the bank.

212
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,350
Scott: So, effectively, the people who owned the bank are the people who are losing.

213
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:24,120
Rym: So, Silicon Valley Bank.

214
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,270
Rym: If you're not aware of this bank, which funnily enough...

215
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:39,130
Scott: I was not aware of this bank until I got to my current job, and I learned that basically, not only my employer, but many, many, many tech startups, and I was even told Apple uses this bank...

216
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:42,062
Rym: Probably, honestly, the majority.

217
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:43,670
Rym: Like, the actual majority.

218
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:45,374
Scott: A very large number.

219
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:51,047
Scott: So, this bank started in the 80s, it's as old as we are, for Silicon Valley tech companies.

220
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,590
Scott: Like, that was what they were about.

221
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,894
Scott: It's just a regional bank.

222
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:58,670
Scott: Like, whatever... You know, not like the big national banks, like your Chase's and your Banks of America's, right?

223
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:04,850
Scott: But, like, those regional banks that, no matter where you go in the country, you'll always see some kind of bank that's, like, only in that town.

224
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:05,350
Scott: Yup.

225
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,957
Scott: You know, I used that kind of bank.

226
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:09,349
Scott: There was some Connecticut bank I used until I moved out.

227
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:13,749
Rym: The Hudson Valley Credit Union, and when I closed my account... Perfect example.

228
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,295
Rym: So, fun fact, this is a while ago.

229
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:21,029
Rym: Scott messaged me, and he was like, "Yeah, apparently the government owes you some

230
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:21,230
Rym: money.".

231
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,030
Rym: Because he was looking at that website, and I looked, and sure enough, the government owed me some money.

232
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,110
Scott: Oh, that's a completely unrelated thing.

233
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:33,130
Rym: Yup, because I used this local bank, and I closed my account, and I guess something went wrong, and they had a bunch of money of mine, so I got that money back.

234
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:39,710
Scott: Right, so Silicon Valley Bank was a completely normal bank of that nature, just a regional bank.

235
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,270
Scott: You can make a checking account there, you can get an ATM card from there, you can get a credit card from there, right?

236
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,410
Scott: But, the vast majority of their customers were two kinds of people.

237
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:58,330
Scott: Number one, there were Silicon Valley startup companies with business checking accounts, right, and money market accounts, and those sorts of things.

238
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:09,610
Scott: And, the VC funds that invested in those startup companies, and often a lot of times you would even have the funding people tell the startups they were funding.

239
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,828
Scott: Like, "Yeah, if we're going to fund you, it's going to be conditional on you using this

240
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:14,109
Scott: bank.".

241
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,228
Rym: Now, why would they do this?

242
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:16,370
Rym: Convenience.

243
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:18,373
Rym: It's just convenience.

244
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:29,930
Rym: Imagine you have a bank where the people who work at that bank, they just really are used to and know the deal with how startups operate, and how the money gets transferred.

245
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:42,530
Rym: They have specialist knowledge that makes them better at doing this, whereas a standard, generic bank might ask questions that are easily answered, or not understand, or be surprised by you cashing a $10 million check.

246
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,490
Scott: If you were a startup, and you tried to go use some normal old bank, right?

247
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,789
Scott: You know, your cash flow is going to be, you get funded, and millions and millions of dollars enter your account very quickly, right?

248
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,170
Rym: And then no more money goes into your account for possibly years.

249
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:05,141
Scott: And then money does not enter your account at all, barely, because you have almost no revenues, but you're spending like mad, and it's like, someone looks at that, and they're like, "Money laundering?

250
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:05,762
Scott: Fraud?

251
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:06,482
Rym: What's happening

252
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:06,743
Rym: here?".

253
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:20,610
Rym: And you just proceeded to spend like a million dollars every few months, just constantly, just grinding that down to zero as fast as possible.

254
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:31,070
Scott: You know, normal small businesses, when they have a business account at a bank, their local bank or whatever, it's like, you know, they might get financing from that bank for various things here and there, right?

255
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,946
Scott: If a startup tried to go get financing from one of those normal banks, they'd be like,

256
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:35,167
Scott: "What?".

257
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:44,190
Scott: No, no, this isn't, you know, it's like, normally, it would be like, I don't know, a deli wants to renovate or something, and they want to finance it, right?

258
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,870
Scott: And that would be, a normal bank would figure that one out really easily, right?

259
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,147
Scott: Now, the other thing is- A startup was like, "Yeah, we're going to need to, we need some financing

260
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:52,550
Scott: person.".

261
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,175
Scott: They'd be like, "What?

262
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:54,770
Scott: No, we're not going to give you that," right?

263
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,457
Scott: So, Silicon Valley Bank specialized in helping out these companies.

264
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:05,190
Scott: They would also, another one of their side businesses, I guess, it's not a side business, but another thing they specialized in was mortgages.

265
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:10,490
Scott: For wealthy, you know, startup people who were buying expensive houses in Silicon Valley.

266
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,250
Rym: Which makes sense, because that's probably the same person they're talking to, cash, that's a million dollar check.

267
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:27,010
Scott: Exactly, so this bank existed and operated as a completely normal, above the table bank, just a US bank, nothing weird about it for as long as we've lived, basically.

268
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:33,319
Rym: And to be clear, the bank was not investing in dodgy startups.

269
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:40,470
Rym: The bank was taking the money from other people who invested in dodgy startups and just managing that money for the dodgy startups.

270
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,130
Rym: So, if a dodgy startup goes under, that doesn't cost the bank anything.

271
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:57,550
Scott: So, you know, just the sheer basics of banking, right, is people put in money, people take out money, like you're just a mattress, but you need to make more money, because like, how do you pay your employees?

272
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:06,930
Scott: It's like, the only ways a bank can make more money to pay its employees, to buy buildings, to do all, you know, to make the executives at the bank wealthy, right?

273
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:09,650
Scott: They had to get money, more money than was deposited.

274
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:21,850
Rym: Short of having a nationalized banking system, even if a bank was a non-profit, it still needs money to operate, and banking employees are not cheap bank tellers and people who do banking stuff.

275
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,128
Scott: That's a good job, it pays well.

276
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,530
Rym: It pays real well, and it's real hard.

277
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,833
Scott: So, where does the bank get more money from?

278
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:28,779
Scott: There's really two ways a bank gets more money.

279
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,587
Scott: Number one, fees to customers, right?

280
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:32,650
Scott: That's one way.

281
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:42,730
Scott: What's the other way is, well, people deposited the money, but people aren't gonna like withdraw all their money immediately, they're gonna let most of the money just sit in the bank.

282
00:18:43,410 --> 00:19:02,230
Scott: So you take people's money and you invest it in whatever, right, as long as it's not too shady, and you get interest, or you get dividends, or you buy and sell low and sell high, or you get bonds and then they mature, and you get more money by investing all the money that's just sitting in the bank doing nothing.

283
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:04,476
Scott: And that's the revenues of the bank.

284
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:09,670
Scott: is that extra on top, and if you get a whole bunch extra, you can share it with your customers, right?

285
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:18,110
Scott: And the other way, which is also technically investing, is to give out loans to people with interest, and they pay back the loans, right?

286
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:27,670
Scott: You've invested in someone's house when you give out a mortgage, you invested in someone's car when you give a car a loan, and then they pay it back with interest, and the interest is where the bank gets money from.

287
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,933
Rym: Now one of the superpowers of the United

288
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:31,434
Scott: States

289
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:37,299
Rym: and a few other countries is that our banks really don't fail, like you can assume,

290
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,380
Scott: regardless

291
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:48,149
Rym: of everything else going on in the world, that if you've got money in a bank account, that money is there in that bank account and you can get it at any time if you want to.

292
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:58,643
Rym: That is like, even as an extreme, radical communist who hates the idea of capitalism, that is a really important function for society.

293
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:02,488
Rym: That is table stakes for a functioning society.

294
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,270
Rym: Even communist countries need banks.

295
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:17,750
Scott: Now being a bank, there's one other superpower that a bank has, which is that it can go to the Federal Reserve, the big bank, and borrow money from it at an interest rate that they had to pay back.

296
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:23,310
Rym: You know when you hear the news like, "Ah, the Fed raised the rate by 50 basis points," or something, that's what they're talking about.

297
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:32,402
Scott: Yeah, so you are a bank, and it's like, yeah, people deposited money with you, but you want even more money, you can go and borrow some, right?

298
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:33,844
Scott: And then you could use that.

299
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:38,230
Scott: Let's say Rym wanted to buy a house, and I'm a brand new bank, I just started, right?

300
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,277
Scott: I don't have any deposits, but Rym comes in and my first customer wants a mortgage.

301
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:47,005
Scott: It's like, shit, no one deposited a million dollars for the Rym house yet.

302
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:48,889
Scott: How am I going to give Rym a loan?

303
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:53,410
Scott: I borrow money from the Federal government, from the Federal Reserve, right?

304
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,790
Rym: I just charge me more interest than the Fed charges you.

305
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:05,090
Scott: I charge you more interest on the mortgage than they charge me to pay that back, and boom, I'm making money at the bank, the government's making money, Rym's getting a house, it's gonna work out, right?

306
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:13,280
Rym: I want to point out, right-wing nut jobs have a weird thing about the Federal Reserve, and they say that this is evil in some way, they often put religion into it.

307
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:21,130
Rym: This is actually an extremely important and foundational lever on all economic interactions of any kind.

308
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:35,347
Rym: The idea that the Federal government can set this minimum interest rate, and that is a guaranteed rate that banks can borrow money, that is how the government can control the economy and prevent extremely bad things from happening.

309
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:37,790
Rym: Without that lever, we are so screwed.

310
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:48,921
Scott: Right, so when we want to make lots, we want to put money into the economy, we want people to spend money on things, the government lowers the interest rate, and banks go, "Ooh, a low interest rate?

311
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:57,129
Scott: That means I could give money to people who want loans to go buy houses and cars and start small

312
00:21:57,189 --> 00:21:57,810
Scott: businesses.".

313
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,018
Scott: We pump money into the economy, and people start spending it and doing stuff, right?

314
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:10,210
Scott: Because the bank is getting money really cheaply at a low interest rate, and then they can charge a moderate interest rate to the customers, and it's good.

315
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:19,985
Scott: Now when the interest rate goes up at the Fed, the bank's like, "Well, listen, you know, Rym wants this house, but I can't be giving Rym a loan because I've got to pay back the

316
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:20,366
Scott: government.".

317
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:23,030
Scott: Well, like, how many percent interest now, right?

318
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:38,350
Scott: So that means I need to charge Rym a really high interest rate, and I've got to be sure that Rym is even more sure than usual that Rym has good credit and is actually going to pay, because otherwise I'm fucked because I won't be able to pay back the interest to the Federal Reserve, right?

319
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:42,081
Scott: So they wanted to slow down the economy, because there's inflation.

320
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:45,010
Scott: They've raised the rates recently, and they're still raising them.

321
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,833
Rym: Yup, because inflation is a big problem right now globally, not just in the U.S Yup, there's too much money out there.

322
00:22:50,893 --> 00:22:51,734
Scott: Money's worth less.

323
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:56,784
Scott: Okay, we raise interest rates, and then there'll be less loans and less money going out.

324
00:22:57,224 --> 00:23:00,330
Scott: Pretty, you know, that's the absolute most basic thing.

325
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,930
Rym: Yeah, take, like, economic 101 in college, and this is what you learn.

326
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,816
Scott: Right, so Silicon Valley Bank, what happened there?

327
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:14,230
Scott: Well, all the money that comes into Silicon Valley Bank is VC funds, right, funding startups.

328
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,680
Scott: That activity has slowed down, right?

329
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:20,110
Scott: Not a lot of funding of startups going on in this economy.

330
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,579
Rym: I would say not even slowed down.

331
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,450
Rym: It is mostly ground to a halt.

332
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:25,574
Scott: It's really slow, right?

333
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:27,678
Scott: Dramatically slow.

334
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,166
Scott: Meanwhile, the startups still have accounts there, and they still exist, right?

335
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,990
Scott: That is the ones that exist now.

336
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:38,237
Scott: New ones aren't appearing, but there's the ones that already existed, right?

337
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:44,309
Scott: And those startups were still spending like mad, because that's what they do.

338
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:44,970
Scott: They're startups.

339
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:52,350
Scott: They buy, they pay Amazon bills and Slack bills, and they pay employees hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to make software.

340
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,789
Rym: Yeah, they're not putting any money back into that bank right now.

341
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,354
Scott: Yeah, no, and the startups don't have revenues, right?

342
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:00,297
Scott: It's like, they're not bringing in money.

343
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:01,859
Scott: They're just spending the money.

344
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:10,230
Scott: It's like, okay, so, you know, the bank, you know, at some point in time, right, all the money that came in, came in, right?

345
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,154
Scott: But how could the bank go under?

346
00:24:12,254 --> 00:24:19,250
Scott: Well, the bank, as we said at the beginning, needs to make more money than that somehow, and it does that by investing.

347
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,899
Rym: Now, that is perfectly fine.

348
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,570
Rym: There's nothing actually wrong with this.

349
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,673
Scott: That's how it's supposed to work, right?

350
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:26,737
Scott: And what the bank did, right?

351
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:32,266
Scott: What the bank did is they bought treasury bonds, 10-year treasury bonds.

352
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,368
Scott: That was their investment.

353
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:34,710
Scott: It's a very safe investment.

354
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:38,378
Scott: It's a guarantee in 10 years that you buy one.

355
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,530
Scott: It'll be worth more than it was when you bought it in 10 years from now, and you sell it, and you give it back to the government.

356
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,882
Scott: The government gives you the money, and you have more money than you bought it for, and you even beat inflation.

357
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:50,664
Scott: It's like, it's great.

358
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:52,227
Scott: It's congratulations.

359
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,790
Scott: You bought a bond and gave it back, right?

360
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,490
Scott: It's, you know, it's like a savings bond, only way bigger.

361
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:05,961
Rym: And the rules are basically, banks have to, they can invest some percentage of their money, and they have to keep some percentage of it in directly liquid cash to cover just day-to-day operations.

362
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:14,170
Rym: Those regulations mostly came out of the '20s, and then the '30s, and the economic collapse, and Great Depression, and we regulated the banks a little bit.

363
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:16,494
Scott: So really basic math, right?

364
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:21,583
Scott: Investor Rym puts a million dollars into the bank, right?

365
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,607
Scott: He's going to invest in some startups, right?

366
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:25,170
Scott: A startup comes along.

367
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,573
Scott: Rym says, "I like that

368
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:27,035
Scott: startup.".

369
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:29,344
Scott: He gives that startup the million dollars.

370
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:30,910
Scott: It's now in the million-dollar checking account.

371
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,850
Rym: Scottco, make me a social media app that's going to make me billions of dollars.

372
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:35,675
Scott: All right, I'll do that.

373
00:25:35,756 --> 00:25:39,170
Scott: So I got a million dollars in my checking account that I'm spending at a good clip.

374
00:25:40,532 --> 00:25:42,475
Scott: The bank is like, "All right, the million came in.

375
00:25:42,755 --> 00:25:43,556
Scott: We got the million.

376
00:25:43,797 --> 00:25:45,059
Scott: It's going out, right?

377
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:45,780
Scott: But we're a bank.

378
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,801
Scott: We need to make more money.

379
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:49,705
Scott: Let's take, I don't know, 250K of that

380
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:50,166
Scott: million.".

381
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:52,890
Scott: Scott's not going to get down to 250K that fast, right?

382
00:25:53,871 --> 00:26:13,490
Scott: And we'll buy a 10-year bond, and in 10 years, by the time Scott needs that 250K at the bottom of his account, we'll sell this bond, and we'll have the 250K, and unless Scott goes to the ATM and closes his account right now, we're going to be good.

383
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:14,711
Scott: And

384
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:28,630
Rym: if somehow, Scott and a bunch of other people that close the account or pull all the money out of some shenanigans happen, they can borrow money from the Fed, or they can do other things like sell more stock in their own bank, because banks are often public companies you can invest in.

385
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:29,571
Scott: Yep.

386
00:26:29,852 --> 00:26:31,895
Scott: So that's what the bank did.

387
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:39,810
Scott: And what happened was the interest rate went up, which means, you know, and then people started withdrawing money and weren't depositing money.

388
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:46,089
Rym: Now, this is the backdrop of nobody's putting new money into the bank because nobody's investing in tech right now.

389
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:46,931
Scott: Yep.

390
00:26:47,391 --> 00:27:04,430
Scott: So what happened was, even though the total assets of the bank were enough to cover all the accounts that people had, right, what happened was people were drawing so much that the liquid assets of the bank, the cash they had that they could immediately use, was running out.

391
00:27:05,351 --> 00:27:17,949
Scott: And all their assets were these bonds, their own shares of the own stock in the company, I guess the assets of the company, like, you know, the chairs and the buildings and real estate, whatever the bank owned, right, it's still a company, right?

392
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:24,390
Scott: And it couldn't really get more money from the Federal Reserve easily because the interest rate was really high.

393
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:40,410
Scott: So when people started withdrawing and then creating a panic about withdrawing and their stock value went down, which meant even less cash for them, right, it was like, oh, shit, people want to withdraw money, we don't have enough.

394
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:46,130
Scott: And then as soon as you're underwater, it takes about like the government comes in overnight and shuts you down.

395
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,630
Rym: You ever see the movie It's a Wonderful Life out there?

396
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:49,747
Scott: Yep.

397
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:51,240
Rym: It's called our bank run.

398
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:52,710
Rym: It's not uncommon.

399
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,210
Scott: Or Mary Poppins, you see that one?

400
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:54,450
Rym: Yeah.

401
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:55,272
Rym: And you know what?

402
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:59,057
Rym: The reason this isn't a problem generally in the U.S.

403
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:07,430
Rym: and in fact, still isn't a problem, because honestly, the government stepped in and did exactly what they needed to do, basically perfectly within the bounds of what Democrats are allowed to do.

404
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:20,870
Scott: All of the bad things, all of the bad things that happened here happened before the bank run and then all the actions basically taken in response were the best actions that could have been taken given the circumstances.

405
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,750
Scott: I don't know what you could have done better, government.

406
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,412
Scott: Yep.

407
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:28,370
Rym: This wasn't a bailout, like a lot of people are saying, even people who should know better on the left.

408
00:28:28,992 --> 00:28:29,890
Scott: No, this was not a bailout.

409
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:36,150
Rym: I've seen multiple people complaining that, oh, government can't forgive student debt, but they're bailing out this bank, one.

410
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,749
Scott: That has nothing to do with this whatsoever.

411
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:38,751
Rym: Yep.

412
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,598
Rym: So the government already insures banks.

413
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:41,400
Rym: The U.S.

414
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,630
Rym: government already says up to what, like $250,000.

415
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,811
Rym: Right.

416
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:49,150
Scott: There is a company called the FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Company.

417
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,638
Scott: You see every single bank in the

418
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:50,940
Scott: U.S.,

419
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,548
Scott: you're going to see this thing like FDIC insured.

420
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,410
Rym: Pro tip, do not put your money in a bank that is not FDIC insured.

421
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,186
Scott: No, never do that.

422
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,514
Scott: But the FDIC, even though it's part of the U.S.

423
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:12,450
Scott: government, it's a government agency, is just an insurance company like Lloyd's of London or Geico or Allstate or, you know, Master Keaton.

424
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,050
Scott: I think he was at Lloyd's of London.

425
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:17,570
Rym: He was an insurance underwriter, I want to say.

426
00:29:17,732 --> 00:29:18,301
Scott: Inspector.

427
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:18,830
Scott: He was an inspector.

428
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,750
Scott: But the point is, it's just an insurance company, right?

429
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:31,610
Scott: So you're a bank and you pay insurance premiums to the FDIC the same way you pay insurance premiums on your car or your, you know, renders insurance.

430
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:43,090
Rym: So that if a bank gets fucked or something bad happens, the FDIC will just cover not the bank employees, not the investors in the bank, but the regular ass people who have money in that bank.

431
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,790
Rym: The FDIC will make sure that their money still exists.

432
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:46,532
Scott: Right.

433
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:51,545
Scott: So if a customer of the bank, you know, you go to the bank, you deposit 250K, right?

434
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:52,908
Scott: At least up to 250K.

435
00:29:53,610 --> 00:30:01,670
Scott: If you deposit a million in the bank in your one checking account and the bank fails utterly, there's a chance you might lose 750K.

436
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:07,244
Rym: Now, that 250K is an obsolete number that was created a long time ago.

437
00:30:07,344 --> 00:30:09,390
Scott: And really, it should be a million.

438
00:30:09,912 --> 00:30:11,258
Rym: It should be maybe 10 million.

439
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:13,870
Rym: I would say that banks are at least one.

440
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,738
Scott: But yeah, I agree that 250K could be changed.

441
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:20,750
Scott: I don't know if changing it is just a policy or needs a law to change.

442
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:21,591
Rym: Yeah.

443
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:31,310
Rym: Well, a big sort of side problem is that in the United States, there are some politicians like Elizabeth Warren who tried to run for president who have been pointing at the current system.

444
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,110
Scott: This is definitely Elizabeth Warren's like the exact center of her wheelhouse.

445
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:41,466
Rym: Elizabeth Warren has been basically saying this exact thing is going to happen a hundred percent.

446
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:42,910
Rym: It is trivial to prevent.

447
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,019
Rym: We just have to pass some basic modernization of banking law.

448
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,650
Rym: And the fascist side of the American government said, no, that's just not right.

449
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,458
Scott: Anyway, so the point is, if you deposit money in an FDIC insured U.S.

450
00:30:56,518 --> 00:31:14,630
Scott: bank as a normal old customer, no matter what happens, the FDIC, because it's an insurance company, they will come in and guarantee that 250,000 of your dollars are safe, even if the bank turns out to be the worst criminal, garbage, fuck-up bank that ever fucked up.

451
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:21,190
Rym: And then they will deal with, via the government, how to fuck over the bank that fucked over its customers.

452
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,654
Scott: So what about the rest?

453
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:26,347
Scott: If I put a million in the bank, I get the 250K, what happens to the rest of my 750K?

454
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:30,339
Scott: Well, what happens is the FDIC will sort of give you a note.

455
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:33,669
Scott: It's like a promissory note, kind of like, you know, sort of.

456
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,670
Scott: And it basically says, it's a note that's like, you used to have 750K in this bank that wasn't insured.

457
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:47,850
Scott: And the FDIC will then take all the assets the bank has left, right, whatever is left, and it will say, all right, what can we sell this for?

458
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:55,110
Scott: And it will try to sell everything the bank has, usually to another bigger bank or, you know, whoever.

459
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,320
Scott: It'll find ways to just turn the bank's remaining assets into money.

460
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:07,241
Scott: And at the end, it'll look at that pool of money, and it'll divide it up, and everyone can cash in their note for whatever that amount of money is.

461
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:08,926
Scott: That might take a while.

462
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:10,210
Scott: That won't happen quickly.

463
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:15,439
Scott: You could try to sell your note to someone else, usually at like a discount.

464
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,450
Scott: So it's like, I got a note for 750K, it probably won't even be worth 750K if I wait a long time.

465
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:33,885
Scott: Maybe someone will give me 500K for it right now, and that person can afford to wait for the 600, and they're happy to make free money, and I need money immediately because I have a business and I got to pay my employees.

466
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:35,149
Scott: Stuff like that.

467
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,453
Scott: What happened here?

468
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:39,617
Scott: The FDIC did its normal deal.

469
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:40,218
Scott: It came in.

470
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:49,956
Scott: It's like, they operate so fast, and it's like people talk about bureaucracy and the government sucks, and it's like, yeah, a lot of agencies in the government suck, whatever, right?

471
00:32:50,457 --> 00:33:01,821
Scott: The FDIC is like the example that shows if you fund and well train and support a government agency, it can operate like, you know, like German trains.

472
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:04,450
Scott: Like the FDIC is the German train of the US.

473
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,823
Rym: Imagine if FEMA was funded properly when we had Hurricane Katrina.

474
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:11,330
Rym: There would have been a literal army of people helping.

475
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,117
Scott: Just put FDIC in charge of FEMA.

476
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,385
Scott: But they come in to the bank, right?

477
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:19,430
Scott: It's like, you know, it literally is like a movie.

478
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,564
Rym: They do it like they show up at the bank store and they're just like, yeah, we fucking, we're taking over.

479
00:33:23,724 --> 00:33:24,487
Rym: Fuck all of you.

480
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:25,310
Rym: Let us in.

481
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:26,975
Scott: They go through all the computers.

482
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,279
Scott: They talk to all the employees.

483
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,144
Scott: They go to all the, they find all the cash.

484
00:33:30,164 --> 00:33:31,950
Scott: They, you know, bag it up and count it.

485
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,900
Scott: And it's like, they're, they, they basically raid the bank and take everything and sell it.

486
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,865
Scott: And it's like this shit, right?

487
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,050
Scott: We're, we're talking on the show on Monday, right?

488
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,134
Scott: These banks failed what, Thursday?

489
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,377
Rym: Thursday, Friday, right?

490
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:48,424
Scott: By Sunday night, they were auctioning the banks, right?

491
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:51,790
Scott: It's like, you know, they come in and it's like, they work around the clock.

492
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:53,672
Scott: They fly in.

493
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:59,722
Scott: It's like, it's like, on Monday morning at the start of business, right?

494
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:01,685
Scott: We, you know, my company, right?

495
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:04,970
Scott: Just, you know, they, our money was in that Silicon Valley bank.

496
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,976
Scott: They couldn't get the money out because the bank was closed.

497
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:11,924
Scott: Sure enough on Monday morning, there's the money.

498
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:13,987
Scott: It's like, there it goes.

499
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:14,630
Scott: They made it work.

500
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,030
Scott: I'm going to get paid, I guess, which is good because I wasn't going to work if I wasn't going to get paid.

501
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,536
Rym: So the government basically did everything right here.

502
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:29,750
Rym: The bank will see exactly the situation that happened.

503
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:38,389
Rym: But regardless of if any of the executives foresaw this or sold their stock early or anything that we'll see in the coming, those are separate, those are separate issues.

504
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:38,811
Rym: Yeah.

505
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:47,389
Rym: The real buried lead here to turn this back into a tech story is that nobody's fucking investing in dodgy tech startups anymore.

506
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:56,449
Rym: Like that ship just hit a reef and that is the actual, I'm not going to say problem.

507
00:34:57,351 --> 00:35:08,990
Rym: That is a big deal because a huge part of the modern American world relies terrifyingly too much on tech startups that have no revenue.

508
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:18,561
Rym: And the only reason those companies exist is because they either always expected like Amazon or Google would buy them, which guess who's not doing that anymore.

509
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:24,450
Rym: or VCs will come in with more rounds of money or new VCs will fund new companies that replace them.

510
00:35:24,871 --> 00:35:26,213
Rym: None of that's happening anymore.

511
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:34,610
Rym: There is way more rot in American capitalism and this is a symptom of a far more wide reaching problem.

512
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:43,169
Rym: And as a secondary point, this would have been trivially presented by basic modernization of banking regulation, which our government is incapable of right now.

513
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:55,170
Scott: So the end result is the FDIC treasury and federal reserve came in and they did something, I guess, slightly exceptional, but at no cost to taxpayers whatsoever.

514
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:56,171
Scott: Right.

515
00:35:56,492 --> 00:36:07,710
Scott: They're basically guaranteeing that everyone who had deposits, even above the 250K, right, your whole deposit, if you were at this bank or, or also the signature bank, which went down today.

516
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,151
Scott: Right.

517
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:15,843
Scott: Um, but basically all your money that was in that bank, even above the 250K, it's there, you didn't lose anything.

518
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:19,529
Scott: You don't have to worry about the promissory note, whatever they call it.

519
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:19,830
Scott: Right.

520
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,932
Scott: You know, you're, you're.

521
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,014
Scott: all the money is there.

522
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,077
Scott: You're good to go.

523
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,727
Scott: And the people who's, you know, it's like, well, someone lost on this deal, right?

524
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:28,950
Scott: Who lost money?

525
00:36:29,391 --> 00:36:32,758
Scott: The owners of the bank, the shareholders in the banks got fucked.

526
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,261
Scott: No one's bailing them out.

527
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:34,883
Scott: Right.

528
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:38,250
Scott: If you own shares in Silicon Valley bank, they are now worthless.

529
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:42,396
Scott: There are some people who claim that they sold short cause they saw it coming.

530
00:36:42,957 --> 00:36:45,562
Scott: And those people, I guess, are very wealthy now.

531
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:46,464
Scott: Right.

532
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:49,930
Scott: And whoever let them borrow shares is in the shit now.

533
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,990
Rym: Just to make sure they didn't know anything that wasn't public and allowed to be used to make that kind of decision.

534
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,090
Scott: Yep.

535
00:36:57,732 --> 00:37:05,086
Scott: And you know, they think on the one hand that's good because, you know, some of those shareholders were evil capitalist people who deserve to get fucked.

536
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:05,607
Scott: Right.

537
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:07,210
Scott: And that's good news that they got fucked.

538
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:16,530
Scott: They found out, but in bad news, you know, some of those investors were like, Hey, Ed's retirement plan and Ed got his retirement plan is losing value.

539
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:29,127
Rym: Of course, I would say that predicating retirement on investing in capitalist structures via markets feels like a extremely fucked up way to do that.

540
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:30,429
Rym: But that's a separate topic.

541
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,677
Scott: But yeah, this rocked the world.

542
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:38,870
Scott: If this hadn't gone this way, it might have been a truly devastating news.

543
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:44,759
Rym: If they had not stepped in on this, this could have turned into, you'll hear a lot of finance.

544
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:46,141
Rym: people would call it a contagion.

545
00:37:46,802 --> 00:37:52,470
Rym: There's still a low key contagion happening, but we would have seen more banks fail like by today.

546
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,331
Scott: Yeah.

547
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:59,903
Scott: But not even that, but like literally every startup would not have been able to make payroll and all the software engineers wouldn't have gone to work.

548
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:04,070
Scott: And then there would all those, like all these websites to just shut down overnight.

549
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:15,070
Rym: Imagine if I'm going to make up, cause I don't know who uses the bank and how much exposure they have, but imagine if like square payment processing and Grubhub and Uber just stopped working today.

550
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:15,850
Scott: Right.

551
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,734
Scott: Well, to give you two examples, right.

552
00:38:17,874 --> 00:38:23,565
Scott: Etsy had to like basically stop making payments out to people who sold stuff on Etsy.

553
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:25,829
Scott: And I guess they were able to probably continue them now.

554
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,150
Scott: Right.

555
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:36,450
Scott: But Etsy had a lot of money in that bank, their bank, and they couldn't like, if you sold your shit on Etsy and then, you know, whoever bought your shit paid Etsy and Etsy then was going to pay you the craft person.

556
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:39,694
Scott: They had to delay those payments until I presume today.

557
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:46,945
Scott: Also, I saw a report that said Roblox, the child labor company, right.

558
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:49,890
Scott: Had like a hundred million plus in the, in that bank.

559
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:58,685
Scott: And so Roblox would just could have, if they, if they lost all but two 50 K Roblox would just disappear off the face of the earth.

560
00:38:59,186 --> 00:38:59,948
Scott: If they lost $999 million.

561
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,637
Rym: Imagine what would happen if Roblox disappeared right now, like overnight.

562
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:07,059
Scott: Roblox is there last week.

563
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:13,030
Rym: in this today, they just got millions of parents who are not terminally online.

564
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:15,830
Scott: All the people who have Robux, they're worthless now, you can't use them.

565
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:28,590
Rym: Millions of parents who don't know about how the internet works would suddenly be confronted with children who are screaming and crying and having an existential crisis that they one do not understand and two have no way to fix.

566
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,913
Scott: That could have happened.

567
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:37,289
Scott: We could, it could have been if the, if the government of the United States in this one area was not as competent as it is.

568
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:38,532
Rym: The moral of this.

569
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:48,930
Rym: large, large, competent governments that are actually beholden to the people are very effective at solving large, difficult problems.

570
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,371
Rym: Contrary to the popular belief of people who don't know better.

571
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:00,876
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

572
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:08,180
Rym: So I grew up, Scott grew up, many of you probably are too young to remember an era when every car didn't have air conditioning.

573
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,366
Rym: Like now, like pretty much any car has air conditioning.

574
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,050
Scott: In the US.

575
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,535
Scott: In my early life we had cars that had air conditioning.

576
00:40:16,555 --> 00:40:19,320
Rym: We had the good car with air conditioning and the other cars that didn't.

577
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:29,320
Rym: At RIT, my first car didn't have air conditioning, my second car did and then it didn't when it broke at one point as we discovered driving a Wildwood one time together.

578
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:41,939
Rym: But air conditioning actually makes cars more efficient because the reality is you're driving a car, let's skip the whole, like we actually have to ban cars fundamentally, but assuming they're here.

579
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,026
Rym: Cars get extremely hot in the sun, like dangerously hot.

580
00:40:47,287 --> 00:40:48,248
Rym: They have to be cooled.

581
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:55,900
Rym: Rolling down the windows and just like doing things like that don't actually cool cars that much and actually make them even less efficient.

582
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,900
Scott: Aerodynamically speaking.

583
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:07,220
Rym: Yeah, air conditioning, modern air conditioning is extremely efficient at keeping cars cool and reasonable, but that didn't exist a long time ago in the way we have today.

584
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,822
Rym: So this video was making the rounds.

585
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:11,084
Rym: It's a short TikTok.

586
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:12,205
Rym: It's less than a minute long.

587
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:23,440
Rym: that explains one of the ways you could cool a car in the 1950s and actually it's a pretty effective way of cooling a car with an asterisk.

588
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,883
Rym: It only works in places that have low humidity.

589
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:30,990
Rym: It's basically a swamp cooler that hangs out your window and it's a pretty cool thing.

590
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:38,040
Rym: My grandpa had a truck from the 50s that he kept until near the end of his life and he kept it functional.

591
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,842
Rym: It had two notable things going on.

592
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:56,556
Rym: One, it had two gas tanks and you could flip a switch to flip between the two gas tanks and two, it had vents in the front of the car that you could open that would funnel air from intakes in the front of the car into the cabin directly and had exhaust in the back.

593
00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:59,859
Rym: because it was designed, this car was actually from the 40s.

594
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:05,199
Rym: So this is just a pretty cool thing that I don't think any of you have ever seen.

595
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Scott: My favorite old school way to cool a motor vehicle that doesn't have its own cooling is still the super old school butcher delivery truck where they would go to the slaughterhouse, they would get all the meats, hang them up in a truck and just throw a bucket of dry ice in there and close the door.

596
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,267
Rym: That only works for the back of the car where the dead meat is.

597
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:28,680
Rym: If you put that in the front of the car with the live meat, you'll have two compartments full of dead meat.

598
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,762
Scott: That's correct.

599
00:42:31,727 --> 00:42:33,633
Scott: But it's great for the back of the truck.

600
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,177
Scott: Just a bucket of dry ice, close the door.

601
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:42,792
Rym: Even when we were in college and there was no air conditioning in our shitty apartment and then we were like, "Why don't we just get a bucket of dry ice?

602
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:43,353
Rym: That would solve

603
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:43,634
Rym: things.".

604
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:46,680
Rym: And then it took us about 10 seconds to realize that was a terrible idea.

605
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,441
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:48,161
Scott: All right.

607
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:51,343
Scott: My thing of the day, thanks to the listener for this excellent thing of the day.

608
00:42:52,364 --> 00:43:13,800
Scott: If you are old enough to have used cassette players, CD players, DVD players, these sorts of things in the 80s and 90s, maybe even 2000s before, I guess, basically the pre-LCD era, before iPods, basically, all those devices typically had what's known as a VFD display, a vacuum fluorescent display.

609
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:16,803
Scott: Once you see one, you'll say, "Oh, that kind of

610
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:17,324
Scott: display.".

611
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:22,951
Scott: And this person on YouTube named Posey made a great video about VFDs.

612
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:26,915
Scott: And I really like this video because it's a combo video.

613
00:43:27,015 --> 00:43:30,900
Scott: On the one hand, it's educational about VFDs.

614
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:50,756
Scott: How they worked, zooming in on them with a microscope, looking at how different filters and colors and different designs and all sorts of educational things, but also is an aesthetic video with music playing and showing you them in a very nostalgic feel.

615
00:43:56,461 --> 00:44:04,140
Rym: The style of VFDs, like the kinds of displays you can make with that tech is a style that speaks to me personally and viscerally.

616
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:12,188
Scott: I want to make like, you know, it's like, hey, these were designed that way because of the technology, but it's like, it's a great design.

617
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:13,609
Scott: I would love to have user interface.

618
00:44:13,629 --> 00:44:16,051
Scott: You know, people have done, Winamp skins have done this, right?

619
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:24,400
Scott: But it's like, what if your whole, you know, the, you know, Star Trek, actually, all the Star Trek user interfaces are the same aesthetic as this.

620
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,041
Scott: Yeah.

621
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:28,286
Rym: Even the newer, we're watching a lot of the newer Star Treks and same kind of thing.

622
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:31,411
Rym: And also there was an era when LCDs got good enough.

623
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:37,240
Rym: There were a bunch of LCDs that would be designed to try to look like VFD styling.

624
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:41,753
Scott: You know, like how cool would it be if your whole computer operating system had this aesthetic?

625
00:44:41,874 --> 00:44:42,415
Scott: Oh, yeah.

626
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:42,997
Rym: Oh yeah.

627
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:43,820
Scott: Anyway.

628
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:45,718
Rym: Vaporwave me up, Danny.

629
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,590
Scott: It's an S tier video.

630
00:44:47,691 --> 00:44:48,660
Scott: Thank you, the listener.

631
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:55,038
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights book club book is the satanic versus by Sam and Rushdie.

632
00:44:55,098 --> 00:44:55,780
Rym: I read the beginning.

633
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,930
Scott: The fact that this didn't even get the book yet.

634
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,220
Rym: So what I'll say is I've never read anything from Sam and Rushdie other than some essays.

635
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,039
Scott: Me either.

636
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:12,205
Rym: His prose is, this is S tier prose.

637
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:14,107
Rym: I'm just going to say it right now.

638
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:27,860
Rym: Read the first chapter, read the first paragraph and you, anyone who would try to kill this man for having written this prose is, is just vile and dangerous to society.

639
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:42,040
Rym: But also, uh, you know, the, the trope of a good angel and a bad angel, but they're also kind of buddies and they're kind of like the evil ones, not actually that good or not that bad.

640
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,323
Rym: And the good ones not actually that good.

641
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:44,305
Rym: Like, yes.

642
00:45:45,107 --> 00:45:50,518
Scott: Uh, this is also that, uh, this, uh, I go, I haven't read one of those in a while, but I know the type.

643
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:51,260
Rym: I like that type.

644
00:45:51,521 --> 00:45:52,463
Rym: I like that type a lot.

645
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:55,532
Rym: That's a trope that, uh, I've enjoyed my whole life.

646
00:45:55,893 --> 00:45:58,500
Rym: And, uh, yeah, this book is, uh, right in that.

647
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:00,320
Scott: Neil Gaiman is good at those, right?

648
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:10,754
Rym: Uh, the first chapter is one of the best opening acts of a long novel I've read in a long time because it hits you hard.

649
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,660
Rym: It doesn't give you time to process what you're reading the pros.

650
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,024
Rym: It's just going to pull you along.

651
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:20,737
Rym: I am already deeply invested in this book, having read 18 paragraphs.

652
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:23,580
Scott: Okay.

653
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,367
Scott: Uh, the final metamoment bit is the website is progressing, uh, rapidly.

654
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:37,400
Scott: It is still, there's still some work to do, but we are nearing the end of getting the things done we need to do to replace the current website.

655
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:42,720
Scott: Um, and then there's still many other things to do after that, but we may hit that time.

656
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,035
Scott: Yup.

657
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,326
Rym: So, so we went on long as we do when we skip shows.

658
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:50,434
Rym: So to get right into the main bit, e-waste is a big problem.

659
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,460
Rym: One of the biggest problems in society right now.

660
00:46:54,081 --> 00:47:00,960
Rym: Uh, mostly e-waste, the burden of e-waste is borne by the poorest people on earth in the least supported places on earth.

661
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Rym: Uh, and we're going to try to talk about what you in an industrialized society where you are insulated from the consequences of not dealing with it.

662
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:22,780
Rym: Well, kind of how to deal with it, because if you're listening to GeekNights, you're probably, I imagine, you have at least one of every kind of cable you have ever owned in your entire life, just in case.

663
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:35,320
Rym: I imagine you've got a box or a bag or a bin somewhere filled with a whole bunch of shit that you have collected through the years of owning and building computers that you keep around because you might need it.

664
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:37,284
Rym: And you might have like a monitor.

665
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:44,640
Rym: that's kind of shitty, but no one wants it and you don't want to throw it away because you feel bad, but literally no one on earth wants this monitor.

666
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,727
Scott: Yeah, I mean, for example, I'm currently was doing a lot of cleaning of electronic stuff, right?

667
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:54,833
Scott: And I had a bunch of hard drives and it's like, you know, I got an S.A.T.A.

668
00:47:55,294 --> 00:47:57,657
Scott: six gigabit per second magnetic hard drive.

669
00:47:57,998 --> 00:47:58,579
Scott: that's 500 gigabytes.

670
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,517
Rym: I've got a three gigabit per second 500 gigabyte hard drive.

671
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,291
Scott: I'm just saying like it's 500 gigabyte hard drive, a big three and a half inch magnetic hard drive.

672
00:48:07,371 --> 00:48:10,700
Scott: And it's like you could get terabyte hard drives for like nothing.

673
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,301
Scott: Yeah.

674
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:12,905
Scott: These days, very low prices.

675
00:48:13,286 --> 00:48:18,720
Scott: And it's like even if I try to give it away for free, it's like, why would someone at least in New York City want it?

676
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:30,920
Scott: It's like they would have to be extremely desperate for like any amount of storage because like you could get vastly much more storage in much smaller like an SSD for less money.

677
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:31,461
Scott: Right.

678
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:32,282
Scott: And it's even worse.

679
00:48:32,302 --> 00:48:43,120
Rym: Like if you there are people in the world, if you look globally, who could definitely use that hard drive, but the cost of getting it to someone, not even just not even the transportation.

680
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,266
Scott: Find me finding that person, making a connection with them.

681
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:48,147
Scott: Right.

682
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:57,020
Scott: And agreeing to it is the harder even than the transport, which would which would still be extreme for the cost to send them the hard drive.

683
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:04,212
Rym: And not even the dollar cost, but the external cost, like the carbon cost of that shipping is worth talking about the total cost.

684
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:09,400
Rym: that is probably worse than just giving them money so they can buy a modern hard drive.

685
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:10,901
Scott: Exactly.

686
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:21,720
Scott: It would be cheaper for me to wire them money to buy a better brand new hard drive where they live in most places on earth than for me to somehow package this hard drive and deliver it to them.

687
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:31,820
Rym: Now, I will say, too, while it is not illegal in many parts of the US because America has a fucked up system to throw things like that away, it is illegal here to just throw that away.

688
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,860
Rym: Like in New York, it is illegal to put that in the regular garbage as it should.

689
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:36,281
Rym: Correct.

690
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:37,263
Scott: Correct.

691
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:39,389
Scott: So how do I have this thing?

692
00:49:39,649 --> 00:49:40,231
Scott: I don't need it.

693
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:41,193
Scott: I have no use for it.

694
00:49:41,474 --> 00:49:42,256
Scott: It is functioning.

695
00:49:42,557 --> 00:49:43,800
Scott: I erased all my data from it.

696
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,682
Scott: That's a separate issue.

697
00:49:44,742 --> 00:49:44,943
Scott: Right.

698
00:49:45,484 --> 00:49:51,379
Scott: And there's there's no economical way for me to find someone who wants it and give it to them.

699
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:51,800
Scott: Right.

700
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,525
Scott: I mean, I put a posting online to see if anyone wants it.

701
00:49:54,886 --> 00:50:02,100
Scott: And some of my larger drives for terabytes, two terabytes, I was able to give those away occasionally, even for money to local people.

702
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,561
Scott: Right.

703
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:03,883
Scott: The best possible result.

704
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:07,630
Scott: But some I found a listener to take some for free.

705
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:08,171
Scott: Right.

706
00:50:08,431 --> 00:50:09,814
Scott: Which is very fortuitous.

707
00:50:09,994 --> 00:50:11,597
Scott: But that's really.

708
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:13,300
Scott: nobody else wanted to take them at all.

709
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,621
Scott: Yeah.

710
00:50:13,661 --> 00:50:18,492
Scott: And that listener only wanted them as like, you know, hobby extra drives or whatever.

711
00:50:18,572 --> 00:50:18,752
Scott: Right.

712
00:50:18,772 --> 00:50:20,957
Scott: Like they weren't useful in any way.

713
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:21,338
Scott: Right.

714
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,964
Scott: But it's like if no one really.

715
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:26,627
Scott: what the hell are you supposed to do with this thing?

716
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:31,996
Scott: Well, you can take it for e-cycling right to your local e-cycle state.

717
00:50:32,016 --> 00:50:33,558
Scott: I think, you know, Staples take stuff.

718
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,440
Scott: Best I take stuff.

719
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,321
Rym: They'll take some stuff.

720
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:37,204
Rym: That's sort of the crux of this.

721
00:50:38,265 --> 00:50:48,360
Rym: The first thing you should try to do is just check out all your social media and free tables and just see, is there anyone in your orbit who for relatively low effort wants the thing?

722
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,307
Scott: Because the closer they are geographically, the better.

723
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:51,788
Scott: Right.

724
00:50:51,888 --> 00:50:55,780
Scott: Handing it to someone just who lives near you is like the best possible thing.

725
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,321
Rym: Yep.

726
00:50:57,001 --> 00:51:02,729
Rym: But to after that, look at big box stores, even though they're disappearing, like.

727
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:07,415
Rym: it's amazing that Staples and places will even take this stuff because they even sell electronics.

728
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:11,560
Rym: But while they still exist, try to find a place that will take it.

729
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:22,420
Rym: But you'll have to do some research because there's a lot of different kinds of waste and every kind of place you could take it to will have different rules and what they will and will not take.

730
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:23,421
Scott: Yep.

731
00:51:23,642 --> 00:51:24,243
Scott: Very important.

732
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:34,860
Rym: And it gets hard because like a lot of e-waste, like I have a lot of e-waste in the apartment and most of it is stuff I've had for a good chunk of my life.

733
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,083
Rym: And I'm finally deciding to just get rid of it.

734
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:51,760
Rym: So a lot of it is like cables that no one will take that are useless to anybody to the point that some of this stuff I got to hold out until one of those amnesty days that New York City has that most of the world doesn't have where they'll fucking take anything.

735
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:56,005
Scott: It's not an amnesty day, it's Safe Disposal Day.

736
00:51:56,266 --> 00:52:05,597
Scott: What's actually happening on Safe Disposal Day is that private e-waste companies that have partnered with the Department of Sanitation are setting up shop in the park.

737
00:52:06,478 --> 00:52:07,920
Scott: It's not like an amnesty.

738
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:20,520
Rym: But what their hope is that people who have dodgy stuff will just take everything there, no questions asked, because they can then sort it into all the different types of companies that could take and deal with different kinds of things.

739
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:28,180
Rym: Because the way you deal with an old light bulb is very different from how you deal with an old battery or an old CRT or an old hard drive.

740
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:34,167
Scott: So what the e-waste companies in your area are doing varies greatly, right?

741
00:52:34,268 --> 00:52:38,873
Scott: Some of them might be doing things like, "Oh, this still works.

742
00:52:39,214 --> 00:52:44,060
Scott: Let's see how many computers I can put together and we'll put those in schools for the kids to learn

743
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:44,260
Scott: on.".

744
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,007
Scott: Or give them to people who are so unfortunate that they can't even buy the cheapest computer.

745
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:53,151
Scott: It's like, "Alright, well, here's a computer that goes on the internet.

746
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,092
Scott: It has a web browser.

747
00:52:54,152 --> 00:52:55,734
Scott: It's better than absolutely nothing.

748
00:52:55,774 --> 00:52:59,739
Scott: It's slow and weird, but hey, it's a computer for nothing.

749
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:00,020
Scott: Here you

750
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:00,220
Scott: go.".

751
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,945
Scott: Some of them are like, "Alright, this TV only needed a new capacitor.

752
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:06,928
Scott: We fixed it and now we'll resell it and get some

753
00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:07,249
Scott: money.".

754
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:10,694
Scott: Some of them might be doing that sort of stuff.

755
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,837
Scott: Some of them might be saying, "Alright, this doesn't work.

756
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:14,419
Scott: There's no way we can make it

757
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:14,620
Scott: work.".

758
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,765
Scott: But inside of it, there is a valuable magnet.

759
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:22,072
Scott: We can harvest the valuable materials.

760
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:23,294
Scott: "Ah, there's some tungsten in this

761
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:23,575
Scott: one.".

762
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:26,580
Scott: Stuff like that can happen.

763
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,883
Rym: And in the worst case scenario, they might even just still be like, "Yeah, they're just going to throw it

764
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:31,143
Rym: away.".

765
00:53:31,223 --> 00:53:41,851
Rym: But instead of just putting it in the general stream of waste that ends up in a landfill or an incinerator or something, they are regulated, at least depending on where you are.

766
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:43,452
Rym: Watch out if you're in certain states.

767
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:51,538
Rym: They're regulated, they'll follow the laws, and they will dispose of it in the way that is required or at least that does the least harm.

768
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:53,860
Rym: And if they don't, they can get in trouble.

769
00:53:54,361 --> 00:54:01,309
Scott: And now the worst possible result is not even just it ending up in the regular trash and going to Staten Island to sit in a heap.

770
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:02,310
Scott: That's real bad.

771
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:11,160
Scott: But even worse is if it goes to a heap somewhere else in the world where there are child laborers digging through looking for something that has a trace of gold on it.

772
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:28,817
Scott: And then there's some horrible, environmentally damaging process where they extract the tiniest amounts of rare, valuable elements from all the electronic waste that gives everyone there gets cancer and poisons all the land nearby.

773
00:54:28,837 --> 00:54:32,180
Scott: And that's happening in a lot of places.

774
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:44,297
Rym: Yep, because the reality is recycling is a complex process and e-waste is a new threat to society that we we haven't really dealt with the last four or five major threats in this type of space.

775
00:54:44,578 --> 00:54:45,940
Rym: And this is just yet a newer one.

776
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,679
Scott: So what can you, you know, the best thing you can do?

777
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,420
Rym: Not buy useless shit, buy as little as possible.

778
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:53,281
Scott: Right.

779
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:59,086
Scott: The the real solution is to avoid the problem in the first place.

780
00:54:59,166 --> 00:54:59,386
Scott: Right.

781
00:54:59,626 --> 00:55:03,390
Scott: You want to not you know, if something is still good.

782
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:04,090
Scott: Right.

783
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:05,091
Scott: Don't replace it.

784
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:06,012
Scott: I was some fool.

785
00:55:06,332 --> 00:55:08,214
Scott: I was buying iPhones every two years.

786
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:08,574
Scott: Right.

787
00:55:08,835 --> 00:55:13,099
Scott: And for those first few years, I would like take the old phone and give it to someone I knew who didn't.

788
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:14,520
Scott: It was better than the phone they had.

789
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:14,720
Scott: Right.

790
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:14,920
Scott: Yeah.

791
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:19,450
Scott: But then it's like once I got the iPhone seven, it's like, you know, who wants it?

792
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,654
Scott: I'm trying to sell an iPhone seven on eBay right now.

793
00:55:21,774 --> 00:55:22,095
Scott: It's like.

794
00:55:22,255 --> 00:55:23,097
Scott: it's like five bucks.

795
00:55:23,117 --> 00:55:23,879
Scott: Like no one wants this.

796
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:24,540
Rym: Yeah.

797
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,368
Scott: It's like keep it and use it for as long as you can.

798
00:55:30,408 --> 00:55:32,792
Scott: When iPhone eight, nine, ten came out, I was like, you know what?

799
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:34,195
Scott: The seven is still working fine.

800
00:55:34,496 --> 00:55:35,638
Scott: Why would I buy a new one?

801
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:36,660
Scott: for no reason?

802
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,483
Rym: I'm not going to get a 14 because this thing works fine.

803
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:42,565
Rym: I'll get iPhone 12 mini.

804
00:55:43,085 --> 00:55:45,827
Scott: And it's like I'm paying Apple for Apple Care.

805
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:49,270
Scott: Like every month, you know, the app, the two year Apple Care on the iPhone 12 mini ran out.

806
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:51,512
Scott: I'm paying Apple like nine bucks a month.

807
00:55:52,012 --> 00:55:52,232
Scott: Right.

808
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:53,133
Scott: But you know what?

809
00:55:53,273 --> 00:55:56,196
Scott: That's going to extend the life of this iPhone 12 mini.

810
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:58,477
Scott: Hopefully five, six, seven years.

811
00:55:58,497 --> 00:55:59,338
Scott: Right.

812
00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:01,560
Scott: Avoid having to buy another new phone.

813
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:01,860
Scott: Right.

814
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,270
Scott: The phone, you know, by the time if they come out with, I don't know, six G and the phone isn't, you know, I need.

815
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:12,360
Scott: I want to get a new one, then I could probably find someone who would take it right for more than five bucks.

816
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,125
Rym: I brought the same ancient Android phone for like four years.

817
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:20,632
Rym: And the only reason I upgraded was because the battery didn't last at all anymore.

818
00:56:20,892 --> 00:56:26,360
Rym: And so multiple spectrum changes happened to the point that the phone actually did not work anymore.

819
00:56:27,121 --> 00:56:27,261
Scott: Yeah.

820
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:31,188
Scott: It's like there's usually a way to find a way to keep something going.

821
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:37,160
Scott: It's like especially in the current climate where there's all these incremental upgrades instead of significant ones.

822
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:37,600
Scott: Yeah.

823
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,385
Scott: It's like, do you really need the switch OLED?

824
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:43,670
Scott: Because if you already if you don't have a switch, yeah, get the OLED one.

825
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,471
Scott: Obviously it's better.

826
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:50,220
Scott: But it's like if you got a switch and I guess you could find someone to take an old switch pretty easily still.

827
00:56:50,781 --> 00:56:52,589
Scott: But it's just a good example of like.

828
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:53,956
Scott: you don't need that minor upgrade.

829
00:56:53,976 --> 00:56:54,800
Scott: You can skip on that.

830
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,261
Rym: Well, I have the same.

831
00:56:56,301 --> 00:57:16,080
Rym: Now, one thing you can do if, you know, you're listening to GeekNights, if you're the kind of nerd who has money, the philosophy that we talked about an old GeekNights and it comes up time and time again is if you can, if you're going to buy something by the minimum viable thing necessary to accomplish your goal or by the best possible thing.

832
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:22,228
Rym: So what I've always done, and this is this is only something you can do if you have the privilege of having piles of money.

833
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:30,600
Rym: Every time I build a new computer, I overbuild it so that I will not have to upgrade it or replace it for as long as possible.

834
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:42,980
Rym: I'm still rocking an Intel i6, not i6, the K, the six, whatever, six generation 6700K, the one that everyone bought like six years ago.

835
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:46,019
Rym: Windows 11 won't even run on this thing.

836
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,044
Scott: Now, what can the industry do?

837
00:57:48,284 --> 00:57:54,120
Scott: Well, what the industry can do is really, you know, I guess this has been unpopular in some places.

838
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,840
Scott: I know there was a thing in Brazil, but like Apple stopped putting chargers in there and cables.

839
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:00,204
Scott: I think that's a good thing.

840
00:58:00,425 --> 00:58:04,778
Rym: I have so many USB charges that are just garbage because I don't need them.

841
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:05,480
Scott: I have an anchor.

842
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,330
Scott: I got a whole bag of like cables and stuff that like I don't need.

843
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:12,760
Rym: I filled three fresh Shurex bags with old cables I didn't need.

844
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,063
Scott: Three?

845
00:58:13,124 --> 00:58:13,367
Scott: Wow.

846
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:14,460
Scott: I've got like half a bag.

847
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,100
Rym: Well, some of that was like cables for old Atari's that no one wanted, like literally no one wanted them.

848
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:24,579
Rym: Some of that was old audio cables that didn't work anymore, but I kept them because I kept having ideas of fixing them.

849
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:28,328
Scott: Yeah, I got like, you know, I just had too many HDMI cables.

850
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:32,037
Scott: HDMI cables are still useful, but it's like I don't need that as many as I had.

851
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:33,180
Scott: I didn't need that many.

852
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,143
Rym: I also finally bit the bullet.

853
00:58:35,383 --> 00:58:42,860
Rym: I had every combination of AV cable on earth and I did an audit of every format that's actually obsolete.

854
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,912
Rym: Like I had a lot of HDMI to DVI adapters.

855
00:58:45,973 --> 00:58:47,580
Rym: Like that's never going to get used again in my life.

856
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:52,472
Scott: Yeah, I had some very weird cables that like I couldn't even tell what they were for.

857
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,720
Scott: And like basically I thought about my actual use cases, right?

858
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:03,400
Scott: I look anytime I found the thing, I'm like, is the scenario that I'm going to actually use this, is that even like remotely likely?

859
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:10,640
Scott: Like at one point, like even if it was just, you know, if it was just once, like if I could imagine like, yeah, there's going to be that one time I need this, right?

860
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,989
Scott: And there's no other way for me to do the thing without this, then I kept it.

861
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:17,620
Scott: But everything else, like, no, there's no way I would need this many HDMIs.

862
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,288
Scott: There's no way I would need this specific cable, right?

863
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:23,318
Scott: There's nothing I own that's going to use it, right?

864
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:23,960
Scott: Get it out of here.

865
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:26,544
Scott: And I had a whole bag of stuff.

866
00:59:26,925 --> 00:59:31,880
Scott: And the way to prevent that is, like I said, A, give people less stuff, right?

867
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,013
Scott: That way it's like if they already have a cable, then they can use it again.

868
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,960
Scott: They don't, you know, got an iPhone, you got a new iPhone.

869
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,363
Scott: You still got cables lying around.

870
00:59:39,383 --> 00:59:41,809
Scott: You don't need new ones.

871
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:46,020
Scott: And people can always, if they need one, buy the one that they need, right?

872
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:49,599
Scott: You know, or get a used one from someone else who has too many.

873
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,463
Scott: Two standards!

874
00:59:51,803 --> 01:00:01,240
Rym: Like the fact that we're forcing Apple to go to USB-C, even though they're kind of doing it in a bullshitty way, by giving us USB-C to lightning cables, which literally defeats the purpose.

875
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,021
Rym: But I digress.

876
01:00:02,743 --> 01:00:03,605
Rym: That is a good thing.

877
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,767
Rym: Fuck that lightning cable.

878
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:11,280
Rym: USB-A and USB-C should be the only cables we use, especially for power in the modern era.

879
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:16,873
Rym: Maybe the third one is that regular old black cable that goes into the power supply of your computer.

880
01:00:16,893 --> 01:00:19,640
Rym: A lot of stuff standardized on that over the years.

881
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:20,701
Scott: Yeah, I had a lot.

882
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:26,479
Scott: That was the cables that I got rid of, basically the top 15 of those, because I was always keeping them.

883
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,869
Scott: I had a lot of micro and mini USB cables.

884
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:33,460
Scott: And it's like, I have devices that use mini and micro USB still.

885
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:37,900
Scott: And I'm not going to get rid of those devices because I don't want to, they still work great.

886
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:42,320
Rym: I kept two of each of those cables that I still use and I already have the rest.

887
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,223
Scott: But I don't need that many.

888
01:00:44,403 --> 01:00:45,325
Scott: I had so many.

889
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:48,291
Scott: And then I had the black standard power cables.

890
01:00:48,352 --> 01:00:50,757
Scott: It's like, what do I have that uses those?

891
01:00:50,777 --> 01:00:52,400
Scott: Like a handful of things.

892
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,103
Rym: I have a lot.

893
01:00:53,223 --> 01:00:55,355
Rym: All the audio equipment uses those, thankfully.

894
01:00:55,476 --> 01:00:56,260
Rym: Like they standardize.

895
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,729
Scott: But everything that you, most of the things that use them are already plugged in.

896
01:01:00,251 --> 01:01:02,597
Scott: So it's like, how many extras do I need?

897
01:01:02,637 --> 01:01:03,540
Scott: I kept like two or three.

898
01:01:03,782 --> 01:01:03,944
Scott: Right.

899
01:01:04,005 --> 01:01:05,260
Scott: I didn't need, I had like separate.

900
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:14,840
Rym: You got to have, generally a good idea is have at most of that kind of thing, the one extra that you use, like, oh, hey, I bought a new computer and I need to be able to set it up or something.

901
01:01:15,182 --> 01:01:16,980
Rym: And then the backup, just in case.

902
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:17,201
Scott: Yeah.

903
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:22,520
Scott: I mean, if I buy a new computer, it's going to come with a power supply and the power supply is going to have another one of those fucking cables.

904
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,281
Scott: Right.

905
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:25,388
Scott: And it's like, I don't need another one of those.

906
01:01:25,408 --> 01:01:26,974
Scott: You just give me the power supply only.

907
01:01:26,994 --> 01:01:28,800
Scott: I don't even need the internal cables.

908
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,057
Scott: My old power supply had a bag of them.

909
01:01:31,299 --> 01:01:31,480
Scott: Right.

910
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:33,341
Rym: Yeah.

911
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:40,660
Rym: In fact, internal power supplies, the fact that there are modular ones, we should mandate by law that power supplies like that should be modular and standardized.

912
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:44,190
Rym: That way I don't even need to get more like that rat's nest of cables.

913
01:01:44,431 --> 01:01:47,700
Rym: I only use three of them, two for the video card, one for the motherboard anyway.

914
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,661
Rym: Yep.

915
01:01:48,822 --> 01:01:49,242
Scott: Exactly.

916
01:01:49,282 --> 01:01:53,688
Scott: And then by the standards, if we have standards and they don't change, right.

917
01:01:53,748 --> 01:02:01,920
Scott: When we change the standard from mini to micro to whatever USB, when we change the right, it's like HDMI to display ports, USB-C.

918
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,009
Scott: It's like, what happens is over time, it's like I got the, you know, oh, you know what?

919
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:07,309
Scott: Really?

920
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:07,870
Scott: A cable.

921
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:12,980
Scott: I had a lot of the, the USB, a, uh, AB ones where it's big on one end.

922
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:13,681
Scott: Yup.

923
01:02:14,622 --> 01:02:18,728
Rym: I've got a lot of A to B and A3 to B3.

924
01:02:18,749 --> 01:02:24,577
Scott: The only thing I have that still uses the big one is, oh, there's two things that still use the big one.

925
01:02:24,678 --> 01:02:26,060
Rym: All the old hard drives I'm getting rid of.

926
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,713
Scott: I have a HDMI capture card uses one and the, my scanner uses one.

927
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:35,940
Scott: So I needed two of those and I had like 10.

928
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:42,467
Rym: But there was an era where cables were changing a lot because technology was advancing rapidly.

929
01:02:42,487 --> 01:02:43,548
Rym: Exactly.

930
01:02:44,088 --> 01:02:56,180
Rym: I would argue now we're at a point where there is a long plateau where we should standardize on, I would say very simply that big old mains power cable that goes in the back of power supplies that keep that standard.

931
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:56,801
Rym: That's fine.

932
01:02:57,421 --> 01:03:02,507
Rym: The standard that take in America, that takes mains power into the little left, right?

933
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:04,830
Rym: The little black that plugs into the back of like an anchor.

934
01:03:05,271 --> 01:03:06,052
Rym: Like that's fine.

935
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:11,838
Rym: USB-A to C and C to C and display port at most.

936
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,140
Rym: Fuck all the other cables.

937
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,942
Scott: Display port can go on USB-C now.

938
01:03:15,002 --> 01:03:15,362
Scott: It could.

939
01:03:15,482 --> 01:03:18,606
Rym: So we should deprecate regular old display port over time.

940
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:26,314
Rym: But USB-C is a magic cable that honestly can do everything we're going to need for like a decade to come.

941
01:03:26,654 --> 01:03:31,379
Rym: And if you think I'm wrong, what the fuck are you going to do that USB-C can't do?

942
01:03:31,419 --> 01:03:32,340
Rym: Go read that spec.

943
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:33,381
Scott: Yeah.

944
01:03:33,802 --> 01:03:36,987
Scott: So what, you know, unless someone invents something totally new, which hopefully they won't.

945
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:45,620
Rym: And if they invent something that new and that revolutionary, then technology and society change again, just like they changed when we invented USB-C.

946
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:46,661
Scott: Yep.

947
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:51,205
Scott: But it's like as if we don't change standards, then people buy stuff.

948
01:03:51,606 --> 01:03:51,826
Scott: Right.

949
01:03:52,186 --> 01:03:58,332
Scott: And they can use that stuff for a long time until it actually breaks, until it's actually no longer working.

950
01:03:58,773 --> 01:03:58,973
Scott: Right.

951
01:03:59,053 --> 01:04:01,015
Scott: And they don't then we can even start to get more.

952
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:06,060
Rym: We don't need to give people more of that thing when they buy commodity equipment.

953
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:07,221
Scott: Yeah.

954
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:11,245
Scott: You just don't have to include the, you know, we had to include the cables when you roll stuff out.

955
01:04:11,546 --> 01:04:15,710
Scott: But it's like, I think even at this point, it's like there's enough USB-C cables out there already.

956
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:23,820
Scott: And if someone goes to a store, like if you go to the store and buy a television, I don't think it comes with an HDMI cable.

957
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,864
Rym: It shouldn't go with any cables by default, I would say.

958
01:04:27,884 --> 01:04:27,984
Rym: Right.

959
01:04:28,644 --> 01:04:32,688
Scott: Best Buy sells HDMI cables, overpriced ones, like Monster Cable.

960
01:04:32,728 --> 01:04:35,330
Scott: That was a whole business, right, of selling bullshit cables.

961
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:40,415
Scott: But it's like, if you've already got some, don't force some on the people.

962
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:44,578
Scott: And it's not just the cables, but like, you know, I've already got SD cards.

963
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:46,600
Scott: You don't need to include one with my digital camera.

964
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:56,779
Rym: People, the companies do include this partly because they see it as a customer service thing, because people who buy technology often don't know a lot and they like don't know how to deal with cables.

965
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:06,740
Scott: A non technology person who goes to a store and buys a camera and might be upset, like, oh, because this person in the store has now got to upsell them and all this other shit.

966
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:12,504
Rym: By default, no technology comes with those commodity cables anymore.

967
01:05:12,604 --> 01:05:20,771
Rym: But when you buy something, kind of like how if you go to a website like Grubhub, there's a checkbox of I want plastic silverware with this order.

968
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:22,192
Rym: You don't check it.

969
01:05:22,212 --> 01:05:23,513
Rym: You don't get the plastic silverware.

970
01:05:23,733 --> 01:05:26,196
Rym: You should have to say, I want all the cables.

971
01:05:26,936 --> 01:05:29,358
Rym: And if you don't want them, you don't even have to make it cheaper.

972
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,280
Rym: The TV could cost the same either way.

973
01:05:31,621 --> 01:05:42,520
Rym: Just let me the nerd who knows I don't need the cable, not get the cable and start to teach society to keep the cables that work and not expect the new ones with everything they buy.

974
01:05:43,161 --> 01:05:55,680
Scott: Yeah, but basically all the accessories that go around a thing need to only, you know, basically should be sold and manufactured separately and distributed and reused for extended periods of time.

975
01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:03,960
Scott: People who buy technology don't end up with a enormous glut of just extra crap that's unnecessary that they then have to redistribute.

976
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:05,421
Rym: Yep.

977
01:06:05,841 --> 01:06:11,250
Rym: So the moral of all this, if you got a ways one, don't buy useless shit you don't need.

978
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:17,120
Rym: But if you got a bunch of it, which a lot of you probably do, especially if you're a nerd, you were hoarding it and now it's time to get rid of it.

979
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:29,380
Rym: It's OK to bite that bullet and get rid of a bunch of stuff at once, because as long as you accumulated that over like the last 20 years and you're not continuing to buy useless crap from this point forward, just rip that Band-Aid off.

980
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,184
Rym: You'll be happier.

981
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:33,459
Rym: But two, throw it away the right way.

982
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:40,740
Rym: Google, use Google and figure out how to get rid of the things you've got and follow those instructions.

983
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,519
Rym: If you choose not to do that, you're a bad person.

984
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:44,542
Scott: Yep.

985
01:06:45,928 --> 01:06:48,620
Scott: And also your life will be so much better without all that crap line.

986
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:54,960
Rym: Oh, do you know how good it felt to get rid of the gigantic cabinet that I had filled with worthless cables?

987
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:56,081
Scott: Yep.

988
01:06:56,201 --> 01:07:01,695
Scott: I got my whole corner of my room here on the floor that no one can see was like a big mess.

989
01:07:01,775 --> 01:07:03,680
Scott: It looked like a like a rat king lived down there.

990
01:07:04,081 --> 01:07:06,300
Scott: And now it's neat and tidy and I have more floor space.

991
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:11,080
Rym: I threw away a lot of cables that I could not identify what they even fucking plugged into.

992
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,443
Scott: I was able.

993
01:07:12,684 --> 01:07:16,380
Scott: There were some close ones, but I was able to identify all of the weird ones.

994
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:20,247
Scott: Some of them, some of them are going to go because I don't need them.

995
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:24,097
Scott: And some of them got put in a bag called Weird USB.

996
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:25,100
Scott: That's the name on the bag.

997
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,700
Scott: Because one end is USB and the other end is what the fuck is that?

998
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,772
Rym: I got one that was USB on one end and what looks like a headphone jack on the other end.

999
01:07:33,853 --> 01:07:35,156
Rym: I don't know what the fuck that was for.

1000
01:07:35,497 --> 01:07:36,580
Rym: Probably something bootleg.

1001
01:07:37,901 --> 01:07:41,194
Scott: One of the good ones I had was the HDMI on one end.

1002
01:07:41,214 --> 01:07:42,640
Scott: and what the fuck is that on the other end?

1003
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:45,776
Scott: And it was actually the tiny HDMI that goes in a GoPro.

1004
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:46,580
Scott: So I saved two of them.

1005
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:47,061
Rym: Oh yeah.

1006
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:47,964
Rym: Tiny HDMI.

1007
01:07:48,245 --> 01:07:50,974
Rym: Also people forget there's mini display port.

1008
01:07:51,055 --> 01:07:52,600
Rym: There's a lot of weird cables out there.

1009
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:52,781
Rym: Yeah.

1010
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:53,569
Scott: I don't have any of those.

1011
01:07:53,609 --> 01:07:54,499
Scott: Those are for old Macs.

1012
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:54,841
Rym: Yeah.

1013
01:07:55,162 --> 01:07:57,294
Rym: I did not have a single VGA cable.

1014
01:07:57,716 --> 01:07:58,480
Rym: I am proud of myself.

1015
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:04,020
Scott: I have exactly one VGA and one DVI and I got rid of all the other ones a long time ago.

1016
01:08:04,362 --> 01:08:06,317
Rym: I got rid of DVI and VGA too.

1017
01:08:06,397 --> 01:08:06,659
Rym: Fuck them.

1018
01:08:08,742 --> 01:08:13,019
Scott: I still have a couple things that have a VGA port on them.

1019
01:08:13,344 --> 01:08:13,938
Scott: Oh, that is true.

1020
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:17,800
Scott: They're not in regular use, but it could always happen.

1021
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:23,960
Rym: I decided if I am in a situation where I need a VGA cable and I do not have one.

1022
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:24,703
Scott: You can use my VGA cable.

1023
01:08:24,763 --> 01:08:25,627
Scott: I will lend it to you.

1024
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:27,095
Scott: That will be the most eco-friendly option.

1025
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:29,486
Rym: But let's say you got rid of it too.

1026
01:08:29,787 --> 01:08:33,040
Rym: I would say that I would accept that fate.

1027
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:38,319
Rym: Like a Greek hero, a Greek hero who's like, I am going to hubris against the gods.

1028
01:08:38,862 --> 01:08:42,096
Rym: And then when the gods strike me down, the only response is, you know what?

1029
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:42,760
Rym: A hubris?

1030
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,499
Rym: I welcome this lightning bolt.

1031
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,465
Scott: Well actually, but that's it, right?

1032
01:08:45,505 --> 01:08:46,953
Scott: So UK, you're hubris.

1033
01:08:46,993 --> 01:08:48,100
Scott: You need the VGA cable.

1034
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:50,535
Scott: You don't know me and I don't, you can't get mine.

1035
01:08:50,857 --> 01:08:51,300
Scott: Guess what?

1036
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,859
Scott: You're going to find someone else in the neighborhood who's got one.

1037
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:55,282
Rym: Yep.

1038
01:08:55,527 --> 01:08:56,220
Rym: And if you're at a convention.

1039
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,679
Scott: You could be on the receiving end of helping someone out.

1040
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:01,729
Scott: Do you need a 200 megabyte hard drive?

1041
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:05,540
Scott: You could find someone who's just going to give you one for free.

1042
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:08,897
Scott: Go on your Craigslist or your Facebook marketplace or your local, whatever.

1043
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:09,439
Scott: Right?

1044
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,678
Scott: Don't go buy one.

1045
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:11,764
Scott: I found a one.

1046
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:14,120
Rym: I found a, uh, a 500.

1047
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,698
Scott: That would be a fun, this, I guess this, this would be really fun.

1048
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:31,399
Scott: How many getting, if you only collected free stuff from people where you live, how many, regardless of performance or quality, how many functioning computers could you construct with free stuff from the neighborhood?

1049
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:32,060
Rym: Yeah.

1050
01:09:32,261 --> 01:09:33,408
Rym: Pick some minimum line.

1051
01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:35,560
Rym: Like could it launch a web browser?

1052
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:38,337
Scott: Can you install a Linux distribution and boot it?

1053
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:38,960
Rym: Yep.

1054
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:42,639
Scott: Can you boot a Linux period by any means?

1055
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,859
Rym: I think I could build a couple of computers just out of shit laying around the house, to be honest.

1056
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:48,184
Scott: Maybe.

1057
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,040
Scott: I don't have any egg motherboards lying around.

1058
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,080
Rym: I did get rid of some motherboards that I had.

1059
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:53,738
Scott: I don't have any.

1060
01:09:54,503 --> 01:09:55,126
Rym: I'm down to.

1061
01:09:55,528 --> 01:09:58,380
Rym: every motherboard I got is in a computer and currently powered.

1062
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:06,850
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1063
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:11,970
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1064
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:17,370
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1065
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,310
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1066
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:25,050
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1067
01:10:25,411 --> 01:10:28,566
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1068
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:32,870
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1069
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,010
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1070
01:10:36,451 --> 01:10:42,002
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this specific episode of GeekNights, which was a long one because that's what happens anytime.

1071
01:10:42,022 --> 01:11:01,323
Rym: Scott and I don't do a show for a little while, are Alan Joyce, Linki G, Dread, Lily, Tenebrae, Case, Care, Makes Music, Chris, Hadad, Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Haze, Penny Reimer, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harl, and many, many people who give less than five dollars a month.

1072
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:09,970
Rym: because while I won't say your name, your support is appreciated and you get access to all those custom RSS feeds and other nonsense without having to pay more than a dollar a month.

1073
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:20,909
Rym: But anyway, tonight, first what I'll tell you is Scott and I were talking about doing a panel at Zenkai Con Online, and Scott wasn't super-feeling it, so I just recorded the whole thing on my own.

1074
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:31,630
Rym: So it'll be on YouTube at some point, but it'll be premiered at Zenkai Con Online, and it's just a panel about what goes on behind the scenes at cons.

1075
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:37,070
Rym: And I have a call to action, so I'm going to post a link in the description of this episode.

1076
01:11:37,852 --> 01:11:52,370
Rym: If you do anything at conventions other than attending or being in the artist alley, I say we don't care about the artist alley because people have talked about that artist alley to death, like there's no new stories there.

1077
01:11:52,910 --> 01:12:04,890
Rym: If you do anything else for a convention, like you're staff, you're a janitor, you work in a hotel, you're like event staff, you're the cop who has to stand outside of cons, we want to hear from you.

1078
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:13,970
Rym: I've got a link to a survey, we are real interested in what it's like for you, or the people who do those kinds of jobs, when nerd conventions are happening.

1079
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:17,205
Rym: But beyond that, I simply leave you right now with...

1080
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:27,760
Scott: Bum bum bum, ba dum ba dum, a duck walked up to a lemonade stand, and he said to the man running the stand, "Well Seymour, I made it, despite your

1081
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,322
Scott: directions.".

1082
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:32,617
Rym: The man said, "Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome.

1083
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:34,726
Rym: I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable

1084
01:12:34,746 --> 01:12:34,987
Rym: luncheon.".

1085
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,288
Rym: The duck said,

1086
01:12:38,031 --> 01:12:38,093
Rym: "Eh.".

1087
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:49,310
Rym: Then he waddled away, waddle waddle, 'til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum bum bum, when the duck walked up to the lemonade stand, and he said to the man running the stand,

1088
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:50,673
Rym: "Seymour!".

1089
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:52,310
Rym: Bum bum bum.

1090
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,501
Rym: "Why is there smoke coming out of your oven,

1091
01:12:54,521 --> 01:12:54,863
Rym: Seymour?".

1092
01:12:56,823 --> 01:13:01,782
Scott: The man said, "Oh, that isn't smoke, it's steam, steam from the steamed clams we're having.

1093
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:03,186
Scott: Mmm, steamed

1094
01:13:03,206 --> 01:13:03,587
Scott: clams.".

1095
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:05,429
Rym: The duck said,

1096
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:06,951
Rym: "Eh.".

1097
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:18,250
Rym: Then he waddled away, waddle waddle, then he waddled away, waddle waddle, then he waddled away, waddle waddle, 'til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum bum...
