1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,627
Rym: It's Monday, October 23rd, 2023.

2
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:09,848
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:13,860
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,126
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,760
Rym: Tonight we are talking about remote access.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,538
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,419
Rym: So, uh, I hope it was gonna be that I got my flu shot today.

8
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:28,660
Rym: As all good people should, unless you specifically are told by your doctor you cannot get one.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,580
Rym: Like, you might be allergic to the vaccine or something.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,499
Rym: In which case, everyone else should get a flu shot to protect you.

11
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:41,600
Rym: But, uh, if you weren't planning to get your flu shot, and you live anywhere on Earth, go get your flu shot.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,760
Rym: Otherwise, I am personally deeply disappointed in you and would never want to meet you in person.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,279
Scott: I mean, way back in the day, I didn't get it just because I didn't think about it.

14
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:53,411
Scott: And also, I was less happy.

15
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:55,720
Scott: You know, I cared more about getting shots.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,500
Scott: I was like, you know, I didn't want to get shots.

17
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,900
Rym: Well, also, the public perception was different.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,900
Rym: And Lewis Black did not help that perception with his one stand-up routine that we all remember.

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,840
Scott: Uh, barely remember.

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,540
Rym: I used to get flu shots all the time, but that was only because I would get flus kinda often.

21
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:13,620
Rym: And I didn't want to get them anymore.

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,280
Scott: Yeah, I didn't really get the flu, and I felt like I was healthy.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,280
Scott: And, you know, I didn't understand any better.

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,036
Scott: But then, starting, you know, several years ago, maybe...

25
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,500
Rym: Yeah, something happened, and suddenly...

26
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:24,849
Scott: No, it was earlier than that.

27
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:27,341
Scott: It was maybe, like, 2000...

28
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:31,980
Rym: Well, the messaging from the CDC and the WHO also changed around flu shots.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,339
Rym: And I forget what year it was, but there was a change.

30
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:38,420
Scott: I think it was maybe around 25th, 2014, 15, 16, somewhere around there, probably.

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,193
Scott: Yeah.

32
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,600
Scott: Is when I was like, oh, this is A, free.

33
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:45,597
Scott: B, and also, you know, good, right?

34
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:48,820
Scott: Not harmful in any way, only good.

35
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:52,337
Scott: And I'm not... I don't care about getting shots anymore.

36
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:52,860
Scott: They don't even hurt.

37
00:01:53,402 --> 00:02:00,711
Rym: Yeah, but there was some point where they went from just being available, to being recommended, and then to being, like, officially recommended.

38
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,360
Rym: Everyone should get one as policy.

39
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:05,539
Rym: And that was a good call.

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,105
Rym: 'Cause now, we're moving forward.

41
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,139
Rym: Like, there's an RSV vaccine that they're gonna start giving kids.

42
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:12,380
Rym: There's that chickenpox vaccine that I really...

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,920
Scott: The RSV one, they said, like, old people, and it's like, well, they didn't tell me to get it, so I'm not gonna.

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,040
Scott: But if they did, I would.

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,340
Scott: But, so I'm just... I just go and get every vaccination that I'm told that I should get.

46
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:22,962
Rym: Yup.

47
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:29,060
Rym: And I really wish the chickenpox vaccine had existed when I was a kid, 'cause chickenpox sucked.

48
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,900
Scott: I mean, I barely remember the... I definitely had the chickenpox.

49
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,426
Rym: I have a few distinct memories.

50
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:42,740
Rym: I have this very clear memory of laying on the couch, and I remember what that couch smelled like, 'cause it was the couch the dogs usually used.

51
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,759
Rym: So it was like the couch that no one wanted to sit on.

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,011
Rym: I think I was, like, super young.

53
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:47,040
Scott: I might have been, like, three, four, five.

54
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,167
Rym: Oh, yeah, I was super young.

55
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,099
Rym: My brother and I both got it at the same time.

56
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:53,900
Rym: But that couch smelled funny, 'cause the dogs also used it all the time.

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,640
Rym: And whenever we were sick, I think our parents put us on that one, because, you know, if unfortunate kid-being-sick things happen, well, it's already the janky couch.

58
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:13,598
Rym: And I just remember really wanting to itch myself, and I had an oven mitt on my hand that prevented me from itching myself, and I was just rubbing as much as I could with the oven mitt, and my parents were like, "That's defeating the

59
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:13,859
Rym: point.".

60
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,110
Scott: I just remembered that I had a rash.

61
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,919
Scott: I don't remember anything else, but I had it.

62
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:21,000
Scott: But, yeah, it would have been much better to have a vaccine and not have that.

63
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,164
Rym: Yeah, never mind.

64
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:25,740
Rym: Now we have to get a shingles vaccine at some point, 'cause I don't wanna get shingles.

65
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,382
Scott: Definitely don't want that.

66
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:32,720
Scott: That hurts, like, it's supposed to hurt, like, you know, but no one's told me to get it, so I'll, when they tell me to.

67
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:44,180
Rym: So I actually had an interesting tech thing happen on my way home, and I don't know, I couldn't find it, 'cause, you know, Twitter's dead, so I didn't have anywhere to look to see if this was a thing, and Citi Bike doesn't seem to post, like, outages.

68
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:48,280
Rym: Like, I checked their website, and they don't really announce when there's outages.

69
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,187
Rym: And I opened a ticket, and they still haven't responded to it, but basically, so I've tried- Citi Bike service updates.

70
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:54,751
Scott: Nope.

71
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,220
Scott: That's not live status.

72
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:57,223
Rym: Yep.

73
00:03:57,264 --> 00:04:00,159
Rym: There's no, like, "Is Citi Bike up and working or

74
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:00,420
Rym: not?".

75
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,680
Scott: There's one that will tell you, like, which stations are out of comm- you know, are, like, closed or whatever.

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,219
Scott: Yeah, but the app just does that, too.

77
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,960
Scott: Most of them because there's road work, right?

78
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:08,482
Scott: Yeah.

79
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:14,080
Rym: Like, a bunch near my officer clothes, 'cause they're finishing the rest of that whole Pershing Square, like, cleanup and park thing.

80
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,940
Rym: But anyway, so I leave work, and I go, uh, in the afternoon, a little early, 'cause I'm coming home, 'cause I'm tired from this flu shot, I wanted to take a nap.

81
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:32,320
Rym: And I get a Citi Bike out, and I start to ride it, and it's one of those white e-bikes, and I get a little bit down the road, and then suddenly, the wheels lock up, and its alarm starts going off.

82
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:37,920
Rym: And this wasn't, like, I stole it in a situation, this was just, like, it just out of nowhere did this.

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,560
Rym: But I notice someone else on a white e-bike behind me also happened to them.

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:57,120
Rym: So, we both kind of stopped, and we weren't that far away from a dock, so instead of being a- instead of just leaving it there, like I normally would do, I actually walked it over to the dock, and so did he, and I try to dock it, and the dock, like, doesn't light up normally.

85
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:58,203
Rym: But I put it in.

86
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:04,040
Rym: But it stays in the dock, but, like, the green light doesn't come on, and look at the app, and the app doesn't act like I have a Citi Bike out.

87
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:05,924
Rym: And the other guy does the same thing.

88
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:11,600
Rym: So I try to get another bike out, and it just sits there for a little while, and then denies me with the red light.

89
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,520
Rym: So I try another bike, and it also doesn't work, so I assume the dock's busted.

90
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:22,320
Rym: And I walk away and go to another dock, and no bikes work, and there's growing numbers of people all trying to get Citi Bikes and can't get them.

91
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:32,380
Rym: And as I give up on the fourth dock, and just start walking back to the subway, I notice there are white e-bikes laying around everywhere.

92
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:43,500
Rym: So, I don't know if Citi Bike went down, or just, like, Citi Bike in Midtown went down, something happened to Citi Bike, and I could not use a bike home, and I had to go into the subway.

93
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,180
Scott: I'm sure the Citi Bike employees are thrilled at this event.

94
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:58,340
Rym: Oh yeah, but it is really funny that the nature of an outage like that is if you have an e-bike, it will just die, and act like it was stolen.

95
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,715
Rym: Because they've told it that it's stolen, or it's lost its lease, or however the technology works.

96
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,320
Rym: I don't know how they implemented any of that stuff.

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,971
Scott: I don't know, what if you try to bike somewhere, like, the internet goes out, right?

98
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:12,940
Scott: And it can't reach the internet even though the network is working.

99
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,463
Scott: Actually, it could have been that.

100
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:22,600
Scott: It could have been just, like, the Citi Bike network is working, but whatever data provider in the area, Verizon, T-Mobile, who knows what they got in there.

101
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:23,925
Rym: Yeah, could have been.

102
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:26,920
Rym: Also, I don't know how any of it works, and I couldn't find any.

103
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,800
Scott: Like, if all the cell towers in that area cut power, that could, you know.

104
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:33,491
Rym: Yeah, I guess it depends on exactly how that works.

105
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,240
Rym: But anyway, that was my interesting thing that happened.

106
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,187
Rym: So, there's a lot of news.

107
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:42,080
Rym: We're only going to talk about a couple, because, you know, shows got to last a reasonable amount of time.

108
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:46,519
Rym: So, I'm going to link to an article, it's on TechCrunch, from a few days ago.

109
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:59,500
Rym: And it is a comprehensive list of all of the tech layoffs from companies that are at least above the line of a website like TechCrunch noticing them, which is a lower line than you might expect.

110
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:03,628
Rym: It's basically every layoff that's happened so far in 2023.

111
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:10,340
Rym: And it'll give you a sense of, it's interesting, because on one hand, I see a ton of tech companies struggling to hire.

112
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:20,539
Rym: Simultaneously, I see a ton of tech companies laying people off at a high rate, but not the highest rate I've ever seen, because Scott and I are in our 40s.

113
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,931
Rym: We've lived through multiple .com style booms and busts over the years.

114
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,900
Rym: I remember people being laid off from IBM when I was a kid.

115
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:36,860
Rym: Tech layoffs are not a new thing, but this feels like it's an accelerating bad year for tech layoffs, and there's a lot going on.

116
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,088
Scott: It's basically been constant layoffs, not just in tech, but everywhere.

117
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:44,559
Scott: And it's been going on for a while, to where it's like, "Oh, another

118
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:44,760
Scott: one.".

119
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,585
Scott: And it's like, "Haven't they been saying 'another one' for months

120
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:48,327
Scott: now?".

121
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,713
Scott: They just keep laying off constantly.

122
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:55,380
Scott: New game companies, tech companies, every kind of company.

123
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,562
Rym: Some of them were surprised.

124
00:07:56,582 --> 00:08:08,700
Rym: There's a lot of stories of people who got through the arduous application process at maybe a big fang-type company, got hired, and then got fired and laid off before they even started.

125
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,699
Rym: There's a bunch of stories like that.

126
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:18,437
Scott: I always really don't like, it's like, come on, you have to at least get your shit together to where, you know, you're hiring and you're firing departments.

127
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,560
Scott: You need to be in communications.

128
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,310
Scott: So you're not, like, it's so weird, like companies that lay off, yet you go to their website and you see job postings.

129
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,720
Scott: It's like, if you're laying off people, there should be zero job postings on your website.

130
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:40,200
Scott: Because if you're trying to move people around from one role to another, you should do all the internal rejiggering that you can.

131
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:52,020
Rym: Yeah, you want to know something, depending on the state and the country you are in, many times, job postings, even for internal transfers, have to be published for a certain amount of time.

132
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,340
Scott: That's perfectly fine, but you should then get those up, fill the roles, then, right?

133
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:09,220
Rym: But you have to put a good faith effort, again, depending on where you are, I'm not a lawyer, that's not legal advice, to interview people who apply to those jobs, even if you have no intention of hiring them.

134
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:10,543
Scott: Yeah, of course.

135
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:18,980
Rym: Because you have to act like you have an intention of hiring them, even though, really, you just want to take Joey Jojo Shabadoo from the TPS department and moving him into the PTS department.

136
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:24,199
Scott: Yeah, but you might find that the person you interview is better than Joey Jojo Shabadoo, and that's perfectly fine.

137
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:24,560
Scott: That's good.

138
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,629
Rym: Of course, there is also the trouble of a lot of these jobs are not- I like those, I'm saying, I like those rules, right?

139
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:30,932
Scott: I know why there are postings.

140
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:35,160
Scott: I'm saying, you just have to work on your timing such that you sort your shit out.

141
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,423
Scott: I would zoom out for your timing.

142
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:52,660
Rym: We got to work on being fucking human beings to each other, and I am not about to say things were better in the old times, but there is a thing that was broadly better in the past in larger companies that is not that way anymore.

143
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:14,260
Rym: Now, then again, I cannot stress enough that business in the older times was not good, and a lot of things were still fucked up about capitalism, but generally, companies had a lot more slack and a lot more leeway in terms of day-to-day, week-to-week profits and nonsense, and a lot of companies would give employees who were being laid off a lot of notice.

144
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,064
Rym: There would be a lot more human conversations.

145
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:27,960
Rym: A lot of big companies would keep people around a lot longer than they needed them out of personal reasons, like humans involved in the process had a lot of discretion for how things went down.

146
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:32,805
Rym: A lot of humans didn't use that discretion for good, but it was at least there.

147
00:10:33,386 --> 00:10:47,180
Rym: The difference today, I have found very profoundly, is that regardless of if humans would give that slack, it's moot, because no humans involved in these processes have any discretion to make that kind of decision anymore, at any company just about.

148
00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:54,658
Scott: Well, I mean, if you think about it, the main difference is that not that there weren't shareholders back then, but today...

149
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,800
Rym: There weren't as many activist shareholders.

150
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,925
Scott: Right, but today, it's more all about the shareholders.

151
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:07,834
Scott: It used to be about the CEO wasn't someone who was put there by the board.

152
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:11,820
Scott: The CEO would be the person who started the company.

153
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:34,400
Scott: And when someone like that, if there's no shareholders to be beholden to, and you've made yourself wealthy, a lot of those people... It wasn't some sort of, I guess, generosity entirely speaking, but it was simply that the people that worked for them were their people.

154
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,448
Scott: It wasn't like, "Ah, I'm enriching

155
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:39,069
Scott: others.".

156
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,254
Scott: It's like, "I'm enriching my guys.

157
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:42,236
Scott: I'm a white guy.

158
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,099
Scott: These are my white guys that I've

159
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:44,460
Scott: hired.".

160
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:50,080
Scott: We're all getting rich together, us employees kind of deal.

161
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:58,360
Rym: Plus, you know, back then, a lot more companies had pensions, 401(k)s. In my personal opinion, the scam of the 401(k) didn't exist yet.

162
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:07,460
Scott: Right, so the profits of the company were there to enrich the employees and the people who worked there.

163
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:16,960
Scott: Whereas now, the profits of the company are there to enrich some investor who doesn't even know anyone who works at the company and just has some numbers somewhere.

164
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,700
Scott: So that doesn't give a shit about anyone who works there, the employees.

165
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:28,600
Rym: That also leads to an erosion of a lot of the, I guess, lubricant that kept communities working.

166
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:40,820
Rym: The example I always like to use is, in an older time, a company that was in a local place would basically sponsor a lot of kids' sports stuff and things in the community.

167
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:49,718
Rym: They put it under a marketing budget usually, but did it really impact whether or not that company sold more wrenches or whatever?

168
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:50,460
Rym: Probably not.

169
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:53,068
Rym: But they kind of just all did it anyway.

170
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:57,160
Rym: It was seen as just one of the aspects of being a good corporate citizen.

171
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:02,620
Rym: Again, not saying every company did it or even did it for good reasons, but that would happen a lot more.

172
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,847
Rym: Nowadays, a company would have to go to the shareholders and justify.

173
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,896
Rym: what return on investment will we get by spending $500 a year sponsoring that little league team.

174
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:18,572
Scott: Think about something like the Flintstones, which obviously is just a cartoon.

175
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:20,798
Scott: But you've got the boss guy.

176
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:21,460
Scott: What was his name?

177
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,090
Scott: Or I guess the Jetsons, because I know the guy's name was Mr.

178
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,193
Scott: Sprocket.

179
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:29,220
Scott: Same character, basically.

180
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,934
Scott: Same show, basically.

181
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,922
Scott: Same show, right.

182
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:37,293
Scott: But that guy is portrayed as an evil character.

183
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,220
Scott: He was the evil boss and the labor was good.

184
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:44,890
Scott: Flintstone and Jetson were good guys who were the laborers.

185
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:46,774
Scott: Those guys were evil.

186
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:48,878
Scott: They would overwork you, treat you poorly.

187
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,909
Scott: But even then, they were still people who still had moments of caretaking for their employees.

188
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:12,980
Scott: Companies like to say they're family, but there seemed to be a more genuine, occasional family-like thing that happened there.

189
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,347
Rym: We were hedging a lot here, but it was more like that in the past than it is now.

190
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:24,960
Rym: There are other toxic problems with the idea of company as family, but the human factor has just been removed in most cases.

191
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:38,220
Rym: And the other thing that's fascinating is who is being laid off is really interesting, because there is still a huge demand for technological labor across the board.

192
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:53,980
Rym: The real underlying factor, in my own opinion, it seems like it is that companies increasingly just cannot make money and thus cannot support the staff necessary to make the kinds of things that they would make.

193
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:56,606
Rym: That just seems to be what's happening everywhere.

194
00:14:56,987 --> 00:14:58,550
Rym: Big companies overinvested.

195
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:01,678
Rym: Even look at all the news with all the drugstores.

196
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:02,600
Rym: They're all going out of business.

197
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,748
Rym: And they said it was because of shoplifting and now they're admitting that.

198
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:07,773
Rym: no, actually, we just don't make any money.

199
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,540
Rym: We're going out of business no matter what and nothing's going to stop that.

200
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:13,181
Scott: Yep.

201
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:20,873
Scott: Well, you know, I think there's also a lot of people who work at these places who are like us, right?

202
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:25,020
Scott: Or like me, definitely, who are not really contributing.

203
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,494
Scott: It's like if you actually are in money trouble, it's like the people who are pretending are not really your phone and an in.

204
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,200
Scott: It's like, is it wrong to get rid of them?

205
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:48,100
Rym: Well, arguably, it is wrong to get rid of them in a society where your entire existence depends upon gainful full-time employment and there is no other alternative that works.

206
00:15:49,440 --> 00:16:02,660
Rym: That is a big part of why unions often operate the way they do because they're looking out for the workers as a collective, but they will effectively raise the cost of operating a company for everyone else.

207
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:10,100
Rym: But a company that doesn't have unionized workers is basically just exploiting its workers and has an unfair advantage over everyone else.

208
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,053
Rym: And everything else I could say that I'm not going to say because this would take over the entire show.

209
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:18,640
Rym: Capitalism is a failure and we need to do something about it.

210
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,720
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's like it's a different story at every company, right?

211
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:31,500
Rym: But like Google, their layoffs were mostly laying off very senior people, like the most senior developers, the most senior product people.

212
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:40,660
Rym: They're laying off the people at the top, partly because I think entire product lines and entire areas of investment are just deemed not worth it anymore.

213
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,585
Rym: And I feel like they probably were never worth it.

214
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:51,000
Rym: They were just subsidized by vapor and dreams and unrealistic optimism about the way the market would go.

215
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:56,620
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of companies that seem to just do things, right, that don't make money.

216
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,340
Scott: And when the economy is good and not fucked the fuck up, I mean, it's always fucked the fuck up.

217
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:16,140
Scott: When it's not as bad as it is now, companies can sort of just afford to do a bunch of things, even if those things aren't big profit and no one really is taking a close look at them or caring too much if they lose money because the overall picture is good.

218
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,182
Scott: The stock is going up.

219
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:17,863
Scott: Who cares?

220
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:27,060
Scott: And then when things are looking down, the stock is going down and the people at the top start to look around and they say, OK, which parts of this company don't actually make any money?

221
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:27,800
Scott: Right.

222
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,063
Scott: Let's get rid of them now.

223
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:36,920
Scott: And, you know, it sucks because like I think about the thing that I think about the most are the comic book artists, writers.

224
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:37,721
Scott: Right.

225
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:38,322
Scott: Whatever.

226
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:48,780
Scott: Who are always complaining, rightfully so, that it's an insanely hard amount of hard work to do that, especially on the frequent high page rate basis that Marvel, DC demand especially.

227
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:49,161
Scott: Right.

228
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,526
Scott: But also manga.

229
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:50,927
Scott: Right.

230
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:54,920
Scott: How many pages you got to do over there for no two cents a page or whatever.

231
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,802
Rym: Here's your half.

232
00:17:56,862 --> 00:18:02,555
Scott: And it's like and it's like those people are working very, very hard for extensive hours, suffering.

233
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,118
Scott: Their health is suffering greatly.

234
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:04,238
Scott: Right.

235
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,693
Scott: Yet their compensation is minuscule, unfair relative to the amount of work they do.

236
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:12,040
Scott: They're actually working hard, unlike the tech people.

237
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:14,082
Scott: Right.

238
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,986
Scott: And yet their compensation is meager.

239
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:22,973
Scott: because the fact is they're there even if the companies were the best.

240
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:28,420
Scott: and Marvel and DC, Disney, whoever, Warner, whatever, you're the opposite of evil, which they aren't.

241
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,062
Scott: They are evil.

242
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:35,040
Scott: But if they weren't evil and they were doing things good, a comic book would cost like 20 bucks.

243
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,885
Scott: The comic books don't sell enough copies.

244
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:46,280
Scott: The thing that your hard work is producing something that does not itself bring in enough cash to pay you what you deserve.

245
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,402
Rym: And that gets into.

246
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:49,246
Scott: there's nothing we can do about that.

247
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:56,000
Rym: Short of social, the fundamental divide of in a fully capitalist society, there are only two ways to price labor.

248
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:00,747
Rym: It is either value based pricing or it is cost based pricing.

249
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:05,455
Rym: Value based pricing is what is the market value of that labor?

250
00:19:05,515 --> 00:19:08,620
Rym: Like how much would people or society pay for that labor?

251
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,407
Rym: How much do people value that labor?

252
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,860
Rym: And then separately, cost based pricing is how much does it cost to make that thing?

253
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:30,240
Rym: And I think, I feel like a lot of things in American capitalism and western, actually global capitalism, cost a lot and are valued shockingly little by society.

254
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,120
Rym: And simultaneously there's a lot of things that are valued a lot, but actually cost relatively little.

255
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:48,380
Rym: And that extreme inversion of both sides of that, I feel like the way capitalism works, the pressures are sort of forcing everything into the wrong category of how you price it for society.

256
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,928
Scott: It costs me nothing to make a casino.

257
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,999
Scott: It costs me nothing to make a leap box app.

258
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,985
Rym: My day job is in capital markets.

259
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:59,034
Rym: You want to talk about something that basically just leeches money out.

260
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:01,200
Rym: It's like it adds momentum to everything.

261
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:06,308
Scott: It's like it costs us nothing to do this, but people will spend a lot of money on it.

262
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:09,433
Scott: And then to produce a comic book costs a lot.

263
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:10,676
Scott: It's such an enormous effort.

264
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:13,120
Scott: To produce a movie costs such an enormous effort.

265
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:18,460
Rym: To produce opium costs almost nothing compared to how much people are willing to pay for opium.

266
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,876
Scott: Right, but to produce a movie, to produce these artworks and scientific discoveries is enormous and yet people won't pay for them.

267
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:28,540
Scott: It's too expensive.

268
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,150
Scott: I'll pay you a dollar for that comic book.

269
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,320
Scott: It cost me a hundred dollars to make the comic book.

270
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,420
Rym: Look at how many people won't buy a video game unless it's on sale for a dollar, like myself included.

271
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,266
Scott: That's me.

272
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:40,999
Scott: That's me.

273
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:54,340
Rym: Alright, in some other news, Twitch has responded to a long chain of annoyance, complaints, and criticism and changed their simulcasting guidelines.

274
00:20:55,321 --> 00:21:00,388
Scott: Yeah, so basically the idea is that, you know, we talk about the posse model.

275
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:03,032
Scott: You publish on your own website and you syndicate elsewhere.

276
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:07,459
Scott: But if you're live streaming video, that is more than just about anyone can deal with.

277
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:13,512
Scott: I could do it, but I'd have to pay for all this bandwidth and storage and whatever.

278
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,495
Scott: It would be expensive.

279
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:16,640
Scott: I would lose out to pay money to do that.

280
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:30,660
Scott: So the fact that someone else will help me stream video for free or even pay me to do it, that's like, well, you know, even though they're putting ads on it or whatever, and the fact that they'll share some of the money with me, it's like, it's hard not to take that deal.

281
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:40,311
Scott: The thing is, if you take that deal from Twitch, at least up until now, they would not let you simultaneously stream on another platform.

282
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:48,180
Scott: So you had to either only stream on Twitch or only stream on literally everyone else because no one else I think had that policy that I know of.

283
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,987
Scott: You could stream on YouTube and Facebook, wherever the hell the fuck Mixer, which died, right?

284
00:21:54,328 --> 00:22:04,000
Scott: Any place that you can find, you could live stream in all those places, giving your audience a choice, Instagram, TikTok, a choice of where to watch you.

285
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,568
Scott: They could watch you wherever they felt like watching you and you could stream once and you're all good.

286
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:15,100
Scott: But Twitch said, hey, if you want to stream on Twitch, you can't stream anywhere else at the same time.

287
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,883
Scott: You could still have accounts on those other places, right?

288
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,105
Scott: You could stream sometimes YouTube, sometimes switch.

289
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,648
Scott: You could stream on Twitch and upload your VODs to YouTube.

290
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,209
Scott: Right.

291
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:33,680
Scott: But you can't have the live stream going on Twitch and YouTube or anywhere else at the same exact time because we want you to be focusing on us.

292
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:33,940
Scott: Right.

293
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,785
Rym: It's understandable why they need to make money because I want to point out Twitch has laid off at least 400 employees so far this year.

294
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,026
Rym: Right.

295
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:45,609
Scott: Because if they allowed that, then the idea would be like, well, every single person would do it.

296
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:54,096
Scott: And then now suddenly it's no longer a competition of which platform has the content people want to see if everyone is streaming everywhere.

297
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:59,240
Scott: Now it's who has the best app that makes that the users like the best.

298
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:10,348
Rym: And then Twitch, who are already basically subsidizing the concept of streaming full stop with this infrastructure, now just become invisible white labeled infrastructure for other people making money on their own.

299
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:11,469
Scott: Right.

300
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:20,575
Scott: But, uh, you know, they for some reason, I guess, decided to do a good guy move and have gotten rid of this policy that no one else that I know of had the same policy.

301
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:21,616
Scott: There probably is someone's.

302
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:23,017
Scott: the listener will let us know.

303
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:24,998
Scott: But they got rid of the policy.

304
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:27,580
Scott: So now you can simultaneously stream.

305
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,624
Scott: However, they have three, I guess, limits right on this.

306
00:23:32,724 --> 00:23:32,924
Scott: Right.

307
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:38,709
Scott: So limit number one, which is sort of a common sense kind of limit.

308
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:39,089
Scott: Right.

309
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:43,473
Scott: Is that you can't be making Twitch like a lower quality deal.

310
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:43,873
Scott: Right.

311
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:44,614
Scott: It's like you got it.

312
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:49,157
Scott: You can't be like doing HD on YouTube and crapo quality on Twitch.

313
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,380
Scott: You have to give Twitch a fair shake.

314
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:52,600
Scott: Right.

315
00:23:52,700 --> 00:24:00,205
Scott: And so that way the app will be what is competing for the user and not, you know, the fact that you're benefiting one over the other.

316
00:24:00,225 --> 00:24:04,708
Rym: Now, the terms don't define any details or parameters at all.

317
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:05,349
Rym: It's it's.

318
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:07,050
Rym: it's so vague language.

319
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,330
Scott: Yeah.

320
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,654
Scott: The language on the page you're going to link is is too ambiguous, which is not great.

321
00:24:12,914 --> 00:24:17,737
Scott: There might be legal language somewhere that is not ambiguous, but I don't know where that is.

322
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:19,118
Scott: It's not linked from this page.

323
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,900
Scott: So so that's that's understandable.

324
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,021
Scott: Why they would have that rule.

325
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:28,665
Scott: The second rule is that you shouldn't go tell your audience, hey, you should.

326
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:32,247
Scott: I know I'm simul streaming on five places, but really you should use YouTube.

327
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:32,807
Scott: Right.

328
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:36,650
Scott: Or here's a link to my to watch me on YouTube instead, everybody.

329
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,352
Scott: I'm just I'm just keeping the stream on Twitch to get you over to where I want you.

330
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:41,213
Scott: You can't be doing that.

331
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:41,413
Scott: Right.

332
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:41,993
Scott: You have to.

333
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:49,699
Scott: if you're going to be on Twitch, it's because you want to be on Twitch, not just because you want to scoop up people who found you on the Twitch search.

334
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:50,219
Scott: Right.

335
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,760
Scott: And get them to go somewhere else.

336
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:01,029
Rym: Now, granted, I suppose if you chose not to take the partner agreement, you could just use Twitch as a funnel into your other platform.

337
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:06,034
Scott: Well, I think that it used to be the partner agreement was what prevented you from simul streaming.

338
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:08,417
Scott: But now this is literally just terms of service.

339
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:11,700
Scott: So you're agreeing to these rules, everybody on Twitch, not just the partners.

340
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,962
Rym: So, yeah, well, because there is that fact at the bottom.

341
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:20,405
Rym: What if my partner agreement was terminated previously because I did the things that you're now allowing?

342
00:25:20,425 --> 00:25:21,325
Rym: Will you let me back on?

343
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:22,846
Scott: Yeah, that's a. that's a separate.

344
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:24,968
Scott: that's separate from the actual thing itself.

345
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:25,228
Scott: Right.

346
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:28,651
Scott: But anyway, the third thing, which is the most vague.

347
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:29,391
Scott: Right.

348
00:25:29,471 --> 00:25:41,740
Scott: That says you won't use third party services that combine activity from other platforms or services on your Twitch stream during your simulcast, such as merging chat or other features to ensure the Twitch community is included.

349
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,062
Scott: In the entirety of the experience of your live stream.

350
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:45,322
Scott: So it's like, well, wait a minute.

351
00:25:45,823 --> 00:25:50,646
Scott: If I merge chat, wouldn't that be including you in the entirety of the experience?

352
00:25:50,726 --> 00:25:57,050
Scott: If I keep a separate YouTube chat and Twitch chat out, I then neither one is getting the entirety of the experience.

353
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,331
Scott: Yeah.

354
00:25:57,471 --> 00:26:00,473
Rym: And even say another one, you they call out chat specifically.

355
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:11,160
Rym: The Twitch simultaneously simulcast at minimum must be no less than the experience on the other platforms, including your engagement with the Twitch community, for example, via chat.

356
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,053
Rym: So if I even message the YouTube chat once, have I violated?

357
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,715
Rym: No, no, no.

358
00:26:15,735 --> 00:26:17,340
Rym: What if I message them equally?

359
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,487
Scott: I mean, the wording is clearly I agree with you, ambiguous and not so that you could make those interpretations.

360
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:27,810
Scott: But the spirit of it is clearly they.

361
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:37,760
Scott: what they don't want is you to have simul streams on several places and like you only talk to the people who are on YouTube and you're just sort of Twitch is just over there.

362
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,322
Scott: You're not even looking at Twitch chat.

363
00:26:39,422 --> 00:26:40,864
Scott: You're only looking at the YouTube chat.

364
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:42,587
Scott: You're not talking to the Twitch users.

365
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:43,168
Scott: Right.

366
00:26:43,388 --> 00:26:45,972
Scott: You just stream in there off to the side or something.

367
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:46,232
Scott: Right.

368
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:51,800
Scott: But there are a lot of questions like, hey, a lot of people embed their chat in the stream.

369
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:59,070
Scott: And it's like if I show a combined chat in my stream, I'm not copying messages over into the different chats.

370
00:26:59,571 --> 00:26:59,852
Scott: Right.

371
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:05,580
Scott: But because obviously they wouldn't want you to copy the Twitch chat messages over to YouTube because that's giving Google their data.

372
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,025
Rym: And they have a fact that someone asks, what if I combine them for for like for my own usage?

373
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:13,790
Rym: They explicitly say you're free to use tools like that for personal use.

374
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:19,097
Rym: The prohibition on third party tools applies only to content presented to viewers either on or off Twitch.

375
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:21,500
Rym: Anything you show to anyone is covered by this.

376
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:22,880
Scott: Mm hmm.

377
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,362
Scott: But I mean, it's still.

378
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:26,083
Scott: it's like, why shouldn't I be able?

379
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:31,868
Scott: it's like I can understand actually using the API and combining the chats in the chat as being a problem.

380
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:39,534
Scott: But so if I display the chat in the video, I can only show the Twitch chat in the video and not the YouTube chat in there.

381
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:42,016
Scott: Also, maybe I can have to I can.

382
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:43,016
Scott: I will combine them.

383
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:44,938
Scott: I'll have two separate chats in my video.

384
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,580
Rym: But are they not then combined in the video?

385
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,021
Scott: I guess they won't be combined.

386
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:53,083
Scott: They'll be like these two separate little boxes on my stream.

387
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:53,584
Scott: Yeah.

388
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:54,284
Scott: Right.

389
00:27:55,545 --> 00:27:57,667
Scott: They don't they don't they're not explicit enough.

390
00:27:57,747 --> 00:28:08,295
Scott: But clearly the spirit of it is that they don't want you ignoring the people who choose to use Twitch because that is a way to encourage them to use the other platform because you'll pay attention to.

391
00:28:08,335 --> 00:28:08,675
Scott: Yeah.

392
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:09,075
Scott: Right.

393
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:15,400
Scott: It's like you have to pay attention to the users who are on Twitch so that they don't get pressured to leave.

394
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:15,760
Scott: Right.

395
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:26,269
Rym: I just wonder how long Twitch will continue to exist because Twitch really feels like another can't make money, heavily subsidized, struggling to figure out how to make money in this dystopian future.

396
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:35,316
Scott: Personally, I just hope that some of the things that I like to watch on Twitch simulcast on YouTube now so I can choose to watch them there because I prefer YouTube.

397
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:37,678
Rym: I really only watch streams on YouTube.

398
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:40,160
Rym: I don't even have a Twitch account anymore in heaven for many years.

399
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:46,924
Scott: I mean, you know, I used there was a time where I was going to Twitch a lot, but that time is over.

400
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,786
Scott: But I go there occasionally.

401
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:50,867
Rym: Well, you know what it was.

402
00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:52,589
Rym: partly I do pay for YouTube.

403
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,131
Rym: So there's no ads, but I didn't pay for Twitch.

404
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:56,452
Rym: So streams would have ads.

405
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:59,314
Scott: Because Twitch paying for no ads isn't a good value.

406
00:28:59,334 --> 00:28:59,414
Scott: Nope.

407
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:07,120
Rym: Especially because the VOD without ads would show up on YouTube like the next day for almost anything I cared about on Earth.

408
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:15,393
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

409
00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:21,878
Rym: So a while back, Emily and I watched Deep Space Nine all the way through when it was just like on Netflix.

410
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:26,262
Rym: And I had only ever seen the end of Deep Space Nine.

411
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:34,228
Rym: Partly just because when I was in high school, I was watching Next Generation, syndication, reruns, etc.

412
00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:36,210
Rym: And DS9 always came on after TNG.

413
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:39,711
Scott: I've seen some of it.

414
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:41,893
Scott: And I know that it's a Star Trek.

415
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:43,014
Scott: It is a Star Trek.

416
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,816
Scott: I know that it is on like a space station.

417
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,257
Rym: Yeah, but it's not set on a ship.

418
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:49,098
Rym: They're on a space station.

419
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:50,159
Scott: Like a big ring.

420
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:51,540
Rym: In the aftermath of a big war.

421
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,420
Rym: Like they move into the space station.

422
00:29:52,441 --> 00:30:00,106
Scott: And I knew that it would always either be on before the show I wanted to watch, in which case I'd like ignore it, or it'd be on after the show I wanted to watch, and then I turned the TV off.

423
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:01,447
Scott: That's what I know about that show.

424
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:02,648
Rym: So I tended to see it.

425
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,790
Scott: Oh, and it has the stereotype Jew guy at the bartender.

426
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,855
Rym: Oh yeah, Quark, who also like written and writing and acting by Jewish people.

427
00:30:10,915 --> 00:30:13,137
Rym: So there's a complicated discourse around that character.

428
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:15,419
Scott: Yeah, but that's the only other thing I know.

429
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,922
Rym: That character is continued, so he is in the new Lower Decks.

430
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:20,644
Scott: Is it the same actor?

431
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:22,266
Rym: Yeah.

432
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:26,610
Scott: So the real actor from the old show is voice acting the cartoon character?

433
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,730
Scott: Yeah.

434
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:33,540
Rym: They actually got, so Kira and other characters, they had the original voice actors, or the original actors voice act the characters.

435
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:36,165
Rym: It's set like years after Deep Space Nine.

436
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:38,108
Rym: Like it's set in a more modern Star Trek era.

437
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:40,531
Scott: Okay.

438
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:42,816
Rym: Anyway, in fact you go to their home planet.

439
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:44,760
Scott: I'm sure the fans really love that.

440
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:45,862
Rym: I really love that.

441
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,590
Rym: The Deep Space Nine nostalgia episode was a really good episode.

442
00:30:50,191 --> 00:31:03,465
Rym: Anyway, we were watching and there was a random episode where we paused it, we zoomed in, and sure enough the silverware they were using was the exact same silverware that I have.

443
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:04,686
Rym: That stuff was brought to RIT.

444
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:07,890
Rym: Like the wrought iron stuff with the little curlicues at the end.

445
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,631
Rym: My weird silverware.

446
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:12,775
Scott: You have a screenshot and then you have a photo of your silverware?

447
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:17,741
Rym: Yeah, so we paused it and sure enough they were using the exact silverware that I still have.

448
00:31:17,781 --> 00:31:19,563
Scott: I want to see, it could be similar.

449
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:22,526
Scott: I need some video evidence.

450
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,448
Rym: I will link you to it and you will see.

451
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:25,850
Scott: I'm not denying it, I'm just saying.

452
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,633
Scott: Because that's really specific silverware.

453
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:30,595
Scott: It's not run of the mill.

454
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:31,376
Scott: It is.

455
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:34,181
Rym: So we're like, it's the same silverware.

456
00:31:34,221 --> 00:31:37,527
Rym: And I remember thinking, I'm going to get a screenshot and make a whole blog post.

457
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:38,148
Rym: This will be funny.

458
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:39,090
Rym: I've got to share it with everyone.

459
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:50,330
Rym: And I tried to get a screenshot and this was right around when Netflix did the thing that prevents screenshotting and then I just gave up and I forgot what episode it was in and I didn't think about it again.

460
00:31:51,530 --> 00:32:09,190
Rym: This website, my thing of the day, is called Star Trek Plus Design and these people are methodically finding every single prop in any Star Trek episode from any series that is something available to consumers and identifying it.

461
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:15,558
Rym: Like, this is this chair, this is this plate, this is this painting you could buy from Crate and Barrel.

462
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:24,529
Rym: And the silverware set was the Treble Clef Flatware by Gourmet Settings, designed in the 1990s.

463
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:28,516
Rym: And I found they have screenshots.

464
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:32,524
Rym: It's actually in three episodes and I didn't even notice one of the episodes it was in.

465
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,990
Rym: And it's the same fucking silverware.

466
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:36,999
Scott: Looks pretty close.

467
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:39,349
Scott: It's got the three prongs instead of four.

468
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,856
Rym: So now I got these screenshots, I can get additional screenshots and do a thing about it.

469
00:32:44,936 --> 00:32:47,760
Rym: But this website has been fascinating.

470
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:56,210
Rym: I've just been looking at random props that they just clearly bought from like IKEA or something and used in a random episode.

471
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:01,789
Rym: Like, one episode had a weird toaster and Picard uses the toaster and the toast pops out.

472
00:33:02,432 --> 00:33:06,790
Scott: I mean, that's a whole job is, you know, putting together this stuff for shows and movies.

473
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:13,598
Rym: But the funniest thing is on this website, they point out that toaster the toast doesn't pop out of.

474
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:24,390
Rym: That means that the prop department of Star Trek bought this toaster and then modified it to pop the toast out of the top because it doesn't fucking do that in real life.

475
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:25,426
Scott: That's right.

476
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,133
Rym: So this was a rabbit hole.

477
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,175
Rym: I went down pretty deeply.

478
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:30,317
Rym: It's a good website.

479
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,100
Rym: Well-designed, well-researched.

480
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,906
Rym: And there's no ads on it as far as I can see.

481
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:38,030
Rym: So good job, people who made this website.

482
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,697
Scott: Alright, so my thing of the day is this cute little video game.

483
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:44,384
Scott: You can beat this game like in a very, very short amount of time.

484
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:46,530
Scott: We're talking like minutes if you click really fast, right?

485
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:53,622
Scott: But it's basically a little adventure and you're just trying to go home from where you are, right?

486
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:58,710
Scott: And you're presented with a series of yes/no situations, right?

487
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,775
Scott: It's like, you meet an old lady in the woods.

488
00:34:01,236 --> 00:34:03,843
Scott: Do you take what she's offering you or not?

489
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:05,166
Scott: Do you buy emotion or not?

490
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:06,289
Scott: Yes/no, yes/no.

491
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:13,730
Scott: But they add this little bit of spice, which is a little square backpack grid where you can manage your inventory.

492
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,889
Rym: inventory Tetris is one of my favorite things.

493
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,454
Scott: And for some of the choices, right?

494
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:22,119
Scott: You can't just, it'll be like a yes/no choice, right?

495
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:25,125
Scott: But for example, it's like, oh, do you want to buy a potion?

496
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:25,726
Scott: Yes or no?

497
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:27,429
Scott: Well, you can click no, no matter what.

498
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:34,364
Scott: But if you want to click yes, you have to grab a money bag from your inventory, drag it over to the yes button and then click it.

499
00:34:34,445 --> 00:34:36,750
Scott: Otherwise you can't click yes because you got it right.

500
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:42,500
Scott: And you might have a few different choices of money items in your bag, you know, to send out over.

501
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:48,590
Scott: And you can play this several times to explore different branching paths because it's so quick and easy.

502
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:49,650
Scott: That's the whole game.

503
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,933
Scott: I beat it.

504
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:52,235
Scott: Enjoy.

505
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:54,199
Scott: And it plays in your browser.

506
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:55,261
Scott: No problem, right?

507
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:56,262
Scott: No money, no nothing.

508
00:34:56,563 --> 00:34:56,743
Rym: Yep.

509
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:59,548
Rym: I tried to make it start and it's stuck preparing.

510
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:00,790
Rym: one out of two live on the show.

511
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,552
Rym: You have to wait a while.

512
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:02,093
Scott: It's downloading.

513
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:03,436
Rym: Okay, good to know.

514
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:04,398
Scott: It will download.

515
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:05,801
Scott: If it says preparing, just wait.

516
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:06,543
Scott: It'll come.

517
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:09,028
Rym: I will play this game and I think you all should too.

518
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:09,670
Rym: It looks really cute.

519
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:10,871
Scott: It's cute.

520
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:15,459
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is all the Murderbot books.

521
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:21,990
Rym: I am about a third of the way through the last of the currently available published Murderbot books.

522
00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:26,697
Scott: I have read all of them except for the one that's coming out like in some weeks, I guess.

523
00:35:27,198 --> 00:35:27,418
Rym: Yep.

524
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:34,870
Rym: So when the one that comes out in some weeks comes out, we will read it and then we'll give you all some amount of time to read that one.

525
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,836
Rym: And then we're going to do the episode on the collected works about Murderbot.

526
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:41,178
Rym: by what, Martha Wells?

527
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,421
Rym: It's good stuff.

528
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,344
Rym: I don't know.

529
00:35:45,424 --> 00:35:49,550
Rym: So far these have been a moderately refreshing science fiction series to read.

530
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,914
Rym: Partly because first person, not often done, let alone done well.

531
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:56,196
Rym: And I think first person works very well in this.

532
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:58,037
Rym: Like everything's through the perspective of Murderbot.

533
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:09,447
Rym: And I don't know, I'm a sucker for corporate dystopia of the alien/aliens type coupled with precursor technology.

534
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:13,390
Rym: It scratches a lot of itches that I personally care about in science fiction.

535
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,832
Rym: It's a lot to say.

536
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:19,536
Rym: We could definitely do a long episode about this when we do it.

537
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:22,862
Scott: The new GeekNights website is actually live right now.

538
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:27,390
Scott: It is not completed, but it is live because it's better than the old website.

539
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:32,934
Rym: And if the listener has any grievances, which many have been raised, raise them, continue to raise them.

540
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:40,299
Scott: The whole point is somebody, somebody already went to GitHub and posted an issue and they provided enough technical information.

541
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:43,782
Scott: And they were like, hey, you did the RSS chapter tags wrong.

542
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:45,783
Scott: It should be start and not start time.

543
00:36:46,263 --> 00:36:48,285
Scott: And I fixed that shit like within a few minutes.

544
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:55,750
Scott: And I have been told that actually the podcast chapters like in advanced, sufficiently advanced podcast apps are working.

545
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,733
Rym: And I'm really glad to hear that because that was a pain in the ass for both of us.

546
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:04,277
Scott: So and so, yeah, we got the main functionality down.

547
00:37:04,297 --> 00:37:06,519
Scott: There's something I've been working on today.

548
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:09,322
Scott: Try to get the things of the day to appear in more places.

549
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:13,626
Scott: You know, the links because they're not in RSS feeds right now.

550
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:16,628
Scott: I got to get the automatic forum post working again.

551
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,650
Scott: I guess we'll have to do a manual forum post again.

552
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,052
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff we got to do, but it's it's live.

553
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:32,480
Rym: And I got to say because, you know, my day job is enterprise, like with a capital E, which is a really interesting space to work in.

554
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:45,790
Rym: I can count on one hand without all my fingers the number of times I have ever been in a situation where something was migrated from a legacy platform to a new platform.

555
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:51,334
Rym: And that legacy platform was able to be shut down completely and walked away from.

556
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:57,039
Rym: that has happened so few times in my life that I still it's hard for me to believe that we're on the new website.

557
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:57,920
Scott: Yeah.

558
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,757
Rym: Learn and play with hearts and wizard.

559
00:38:15,797 --> 00:38:24,330
Rym: We're going to teach you all how to play with hearts and wizard, because between the three you will learn every important core concept of trick taking games.

560
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:34,430
Rym: And if you go to this event for two hours, Scott and I are going to fairly personally teach you how to be good at trick taking games in a way that will not make you a world champion.

561
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,953
Scott: Not great because we're not the best, but quite good.

562
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:50,230
Rym: You will beat anyone who is not great at trick taking games and does not go to an event like this because we're going to give you very specific advice about how to force someone to eat that fucking queen in hearts.

563
00:38:51,673 --> 00:38:52,296
Scott: Count the cards.

564
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:54,910
Scott: Desuit yourself quickly.

565
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,275
Rym: I will say I am real, real good at hearts.

566
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:09,129
Rym: Like hearts is a game that I think I play as perfectly as you can without completely counting cards because I'm just not willing to completely count cards.

567
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,130
Rym: You don't cheat at hearts.

568
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,629
Rym: The only game you cheat at is Euchre and we're not teaching Euchre.

569
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:14,409
Scott: Good.

570
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,270
Rym: Euchre's just better with.

571
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,374
Rym: Anyway, and on Saturday, December 2nd, two thirty p.m.

572
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:24,038
Rym: in the Crab God Theater, we're doing a brand new panel.

573
00:39:24,398 --> 00:39:33,730
Rym: We're making a series of panels now following on from an old panel we did a long time ago that was very, very, very popular and was in a far too small room.

574
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,551
Rym: So there's video of it.

575
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:36,335
Rym: Thankfully, mastering game mechanics.

576
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:41,965
Rym: We are now going to take a bunch of game mechanics for many years to come and do entire panels about them.

577
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,730
Rym: So we are doing our first one worker placement.

578
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:50,149
Rym: If you want to hear me and Scott talk about just worker placement games for an hour.

579
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:56,810
Scott: Well, not even games, the mechanic worker worker, the other part of the game that is not worker placement.

580
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,770
Scott: We're not talking about that part, just the worker part.

581
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:06,570
Rym: I feel like we're going to spend about six minutes just talking about the baby in Agricola, not even any other part of Agricola, just the baby.

582
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,433
Scott: That's probably the first thing.

583
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:10,239
Scott: It's like we're probably half.

584
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:12,666
Scott: the panel will be like, what is worker placement, right?

585
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:13,830
Scott: History of worker placement.

586
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:19,110
Scott: And the other half of the panel will be like how to how to place the workers the best, how to win.

587
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:19,631
Scott: Yep.

588
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:20,655
Rym: Zoomed in.

589
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:23,665
Rym: Maybe the attributes of where you'll see there'll be a good panel.

590
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:24,669
Rym: I'm excited about this one.

591
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,837
Rym: And Magfest panel submissions closed.

592
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:33,690
Rym: There is a very good chance GeekNights will be at Magfest doing a bunch of content details TBD.

593
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:36,395
Rym: If you didn't get a hotel room for Magfest.

594
00:40:36,655 --> 00:40:37,978
Rym: Well, good fucking luck.

595
00:40:38,038 --> 00:40:41,446
Rym: Now, Magfest seems to be back in its full.

596
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:43,210
Rym: impossible to get hotels.

597
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:49,190
Scott: I went into the Magfest hotel lottery just to see and the queue of people was tens of thousands.

598
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:58,970
Scott: And I looked up online that the capacity, the number of rooms in the Gaylord National Harbor Hotel Convention Center place was much fewer than that number.

599
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:04,330
Scott: So most people will not have rooms in the Magfest main hotel.

600
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:11,650
Rym: It's an aside and it sucks because on one hand, I want as many people to be able to experience things like Magfest as possible.

601
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:13,595
Rym: But the physical world is limited.

602
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:19,390
Rym: Like there's nowhere that could host everyone who wants to go to Magfest at Magfest.

603
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:27,770
Rym: Nowhere exists that could host Magfest that Magfest would be capable of using and could take all the people who want to go to Magfest.

604
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,245
Rym: But at the same time, Magfest was great when it was all in one hotel.

605
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:35,930
Rym: Those old times.

606
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:43,985
Rym: I really wish there was a way to have a convention that was like those old Magfests, but did not have 100,000 people trying to get like 8,000 slots.

607
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,210
Scott: It wouldn't be 100,000.

608
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:49,633
Rym: I don't know.

609
00:41:49,713 --> 00:41:52,369
Rym: How many people want to go to Magfest now?

610
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,560
Scott: Probably between 10 and 20K, I'd say.

611
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:57,770
Rym: I guess more between 30 and 40.

612
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,389
Scott: Or at least 10 and 20K rooms.

613
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:00,810
Scott: True.

614
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,569
Scott: Each room is going to have more than one person.

615
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,071
Scott: Yup.

616
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:07,377
Rym: But how many rooms are there in the actual building?

617
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:15,390
Rym: Because what made those old Magfest magical was that it was 24/7 for four days and everyone who was at that event was staying in the same fucking hotel.

618
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,817
Scott: The hotel contains 2,000 guest rooms, 95 event rooms, 53, 7 square feet, blah blah blah.

619
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:19,419
Scott: 2,000 guest rooms.

620
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:25,630
Rym: That is terrifying.

621
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,560
Scott: Yeah.

622
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:28,710
Rym: Alright.

623
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:49,450
Rym: So, in ancient, ancient times, like, once computers were on the internet and you could try, like you wanted to access your computer from somewhere else and that was possible without like special setups and special technology that are probably too old to really be worth talking about and derailing us.

624
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:58,490
Rym: Like, once I had a computer on the internet, the next thing I wanted to do was access that computer when I wasn't in my house and...

625
00:42:59,010 --> 00:42:59,070
Scott: Yup.

626
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:06,349
Scott: Like, if I'm at school, it's like, you know, "Hey, you know, I gotta bring my data to school back and forth on floppy

627
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:06,570
Scott: disks.".

628
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,159
Scott: I did that up until like, you know, early 2000s.

629
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,150
Scott: I was still using floppy disks and, you know, I didn't have a zip drive.

630
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,642
Rym: Up until about 2003, I had a zip drive.

631
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,510
Scott: USB sticks weren't really a thing yet.

632
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,954
Rym: Yeah, I had a zip drive.

633
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:19,977
Rym: Z.I.P.

634
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:21,661
Rym: If you don't know what those are, well, thank God.

635
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:22,684
Rym: They were bad news.

636
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:32,990
Scott: But the only way that you were carrying your data around with you was either a laptop or some sort of disks of some kind.

637
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:34,412
Rym: Yup.

638
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:40,530
Rym: Data was, let alone applications, anything else you wanted to actually like do with your computer.

639
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:50,230
Rym: Like, there weren't really clouds yet, so a lot of the stuff I would want to do if I could access my computer were because I needed access to all the things that computer could do.

640
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:54,822
Rym: Like, couldn't take my save files and run them somewhere else on video games.

641
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:57,310
Rym: Like, save files barely existed and the way they were stored was nonsense.

642
00:43:57,911 --> 00:44:10,408
Rym: There was, the world was very different and it was kind of a, unless you were a nerd with access to a lot of interesting tech, or very clever and technologically adept, there really wasn't a good way to do it.

643
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:11,850
Rym: At all.

644
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:32,090
Scott: It's your computer was, even though there was internet, and even if your computer didn't even have dial-up, if you had a cable modem or an always-on internet connection, it was still quite difficult to reach the computer at your home, even though it should be theoretically possible because that's on the internet and this computer you're sitting at in the library is on the internet.

645
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:32,957
Scott: Yup.

646
00:44:32,977 --> 00:44:33,850
Scott: But, good luck.

647
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,938
Rym: And I remember a specific moment, a long, long time ago.

648
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,863
Rym: Scott and I did the thing we used to do.

649
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:41,230
Rym: We went to Wildwood for a week so there wouldn't be GeekNights.

650
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:48,450
Rym: But back when we were, I guess, insane and we did the show four nights a week, we also had a thing where we didn't want to skip a show.

651
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:52,384
Rym: So we got a bunch of guests to record episodes for while we were going to be out of town.

652
00:44:52,705 --> 00:44:54,170
Rym: We scheduled them all up to go live.

653
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,143
Rym: And one of the episodes failed to post because I fucked something up when I set it up.

654
00:45:00,183 --> 00:45:02,269
Rym: The MP3 was too big and it failed.

655
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:02,870
Rym: Something happened.

656
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,178
Rym: So we're in Wildwood and the Monday episode went live.

657
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,045
Rym: And then I think the Tuesday episode went live.

658
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:10,590
Rym: But one of the episodes didn't go live.

659
00:45:11,351 --> 00:45:26,330
Rym: And there was literally no way for me to fix this short of driving home to my computer because there was no possible way to get the file I needed and then use the web to fix it and upload the episode.

660
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,595
Rym: Now, anyone can do remote access anywhere.

661
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:32,659
Rym: There's a million, million, million ways to do it.

662
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,130
Rym: And it comes down kind of, it's almost like, for many people, it's kind of an obsolete concept.

663
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:54,570
Rym: Because now, very few people have anything on their physical computer sitting in their home that they actually need access to because all the things they use their computer for are themselves online and most of anyone's interactions with the computer is through a web browser.

664
00:45:54,650 --> 00:46:01,150
Rym: In fact, if you type remote access into Google or Bing right now, the top result is Chrome remote desktop.

665
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:13,950
Scott: Yeah, it's, you know, if you're storing all your stuff in, quote, the cloud, someone else's computer, it's like, well, that someone else's computer is in, you know, one of these cloud services, Azure, Oz, whatever.

666
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:18,959
Scott: They're on computers that are just have domains like the Google's computers or whatever.

667
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:24,590
Scott: And it's like, you know, no matter which computer or phone or device you're using on Earth, you can reach those computers.

668
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:28,516
Scott: And so what purpose is there of reaching your computer?

669
00:46:28,716 --> 00:46:37,430
Scott: It's like, if you have your phone and you can, all your data is at Google and you can reach Google, why the fuck would you need to reach your desktop in your house?

670
00:46:37,811 --> 00:46:38,051
Scott: Yep.

671
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:40,196
Scott: There's no reason to do that, right?

672
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:44,204
Scott: Because there's nothing on that computer at your house that you need so desperately.

673
00:46:44,945 --> 00:46:47,150
Scott: You got your phone and your stuff is in the cloud, the end.

674
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:47,570
Scott: Yep.

675
00:46:47,831 --> 00:46:58,030
Rym: And I would say right now that in the modern era, there are two classes of use cases for actually needing access to your actual physical desktop computer when you are not in your home.

676
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:06,742
Rym: Class one, you actually don't and you're just not technological or knowledgeable enough to not have to access that computer.

677
00:47:06,842 --> 00:47:11,109
Rym: Like you could do whatever you're doing in a way where you don't need to access that physical computer.

678
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:11,770
Rym: You just don't know it.

679
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,615
Rym: Or two, you're a nerd with some sort of specialized use case.

680
00:47:15,756 --> 00:47:24,930
Rym: Like there are things, there is data and things I might want to have access to or do something with that literally are only on my local network for specific reasons.

681
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:25,110
Rym: Yeah.

682
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:27,435
Scott: I got a data on my NAS, right?

683
00:47:27,496 --> 00:47:29,320
Scott: And I'm not paying to store that shit in the cloud.

684
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,910
Scott: It's a bunch of giant video files, but I want to edit video and I forgot to bring the video file with me.

685
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:34,670
Scott: Yep.

686
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:39,036
Scott: Oh, I'm running, I'm running services from in my house.

687
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:42,581
Scott: There's a website that I'm not paying to host on a hosting platform.

688
00:47:42,621 --> 00:47:49,730
Scott: I have the website running on a server in my house and I got to mess with it, which means I need to access the network in my house.

689
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:52,635
Scott: What else could there be?

690
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:57,290
Scott: I want to play a video game with somebody who's in my house.

691
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:07,450
Scott: But that video game is some ancient weird video game with land mode and it's not like Counter-Strike where you can just play against each other because there's cloud servers.

692
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:14,210
Rym: Though even in that case, if the game runs on Steam, Steam has actually provided some capabilities to solve that kind of problem.

693
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:15,870
Scott: They have indeed.

694
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,990
Rym: It works pretty well most of the time.

695
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:20,409
Scott: They sure have.

696
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,250
Rym: And where it hasn't worked has been for inexplicable reasons.

697
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,933
Scott: Another good example would be Steam stream, right?

698
00:48:25,953 --> 00:48:31,682
Scott: It's like Steam streaming only works in your house, but it's like, Hey, I got to, I want to run the game on my computer.

699
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:36,930
Scott: that's in my house, but I want to play the game on my phone at a cafe somewhere, right?

700
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,138
Scott: It's like Steam stream is going to be like, Hey, I don't detect any other Steam device.

701
00:48:41,178 --> 00:48:44,286
Scott: If you just try to use it straight up, it only looks on the land.

702
00:48:44,346 --> 00:48:46,030
Scott: It won't see your computer at your house.

703
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:52,370
Scott: You have to connect your phone with like a VPN to your house, so then it can see your desktop and then do the Steam stream.

704
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:58,870
Rym: Now, the whole other set of use cases, I don't know if we want to talk about them today, are for work purposes.

705
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:04,390
Rym: Like if you have a work machine that you need remote access to, as opposed to a personal machine you need access to.

706
00:49:04,912 --> 00:49:06,122
Rym: That could be a separate show.

707
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:06,989
Rym: It could be part of this.

708
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:14,910
Scott: I'm doing a 3d work and I pushed render and then I leave the house, but that render is just going to be on this desktop.

709
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:19,585
Scott: And then when I get to work, I need to reach home to grab it from that computer.

710
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,270
Scott: There's no auto upload configured.

711
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:22,512
Rym: I work for a company.

712
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:32,830
Rym: Some of the things I need to do, I can access via the internet in a very secure manner from any computer using a bunch of security, but there are some things that are more sensitive.

713
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,975
Rym: And actually as a person, I have personal use cases like this too.

714
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:45,170
Rym: Things that are sensitive enough to where they have security, but I explicitly make sure they are only accessible from within the network that I trust.

715
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,352
Rym: So, and my work does the same thing.

716
00:49:47,372 --> 00:49:58,330
Rym: There are some things I can only access if I do the equivalent of a VPN or a secure remote desktop into a physical facility owned by the company and from there access that service.

717
00:49:58,972 --> 00:49:59,293
Scott: All right.

718
00:49:59,313 --> 00:50:01,821
Scott: So we talked about the reasons you would do this.

719
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:03,687
Scott: Let's talk about how to do it in the year 2023, right?

720
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:10,230
Scott: So the first way to do it in the year 2023 is somehow get a static IP address for your house, right?

721
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:18,970
Scott: If you can get a static IP address for your house, then you can just configure your router to intentionally expose some services and not others.

722
00:50:19,491 --> 00:50:25,450
Scott: And as long as those exposed services are secure, you can use those services to access your home network properly.

723
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,810
Scott: For example, like an SSH tunnel or a VPN.

724
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:33,921
Rym: If you have a static IP, you can literally just configure your network and all your servers.

725
00:50:34,222 --> 00:50:36,107
Rym: You can expose them publicly to the internet.

726
00:50:36,187 --> 00:50:37,170
Rym: You can do a lot.

727
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:38,090
Scott: Yep.

728
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,335
Scott: You get your smart firewalls.

729
00:50:39,355 --> 00:50:43,750
Scott: You just got to protect yourself because you don't want to let just any shmo into your home network, right?

730
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,930
Scott: You have to put up a big beefy wall of correctness in front of that.

731
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:54,150
Scott: The second thing, just as close to being as simple, you have an IP address that changes, but not too often.

732
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:58,543
Scott: And you actually go through the effort of using dynamic DNS, however that works today.

733
00:50:58,583 --> 00:50:59,767
Scott: It's always been a mess.

734
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:00,710
Scott: It always will be a mess.

735
00:51:01,452 --> 00:51:01,833
Rym: Yep.

736
00:51:01,874 --> 00:51:05,090
Rym: Find two how-to guides and between the two of them, you'll get it to work.

737
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:08,849
Scott: You might have to pay a service to help you or something, but some sort of dynamic DNS.

738
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:16,446
Scott: And then, okay, your IP address changes, but you can always visit scottshouse.dynamicdns.com.

739
00:51:18,832 --> 00:51:25,010
Scott: And that will go to your house and you'll get the IP address of your house where the same setup is existing and now you can access your house.

740
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:37,230
Rym: Now, that still depends on what are you going to do with that access because if you are running nerdy server type stuff, direct access means I SSH directly into the thing I want to futz with.

741
00:51:37,691 --> 00:51:45,430
Rym: But say you got a Windows desktop, you probably need to set up some sort of remote access desktop like RDP or Chrome remote access.

742
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:51,489
Rym: You need something to give you UI access, like a service to hit to do something with.

743
00:51:53,792 --> 00:51:59,050
Scott: Alright, now your third option is that you basically enlist the help of the cloud.

744
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,762
Scott: It's like, okay, my home stuff is completely sealed off.

745
00:52:02,982 --> 00:52:05,110
Scott: There's no way to directly connect to my house.

746
00:52:05,852 --> 00:52:08,903
Scott: It's normal router with the normal configuration, NAT router.

747
00:52:09,204 --> 00:52:11,150
Scott: There's no exposed ports whatsoever.

748
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:17,290
Scott: Even if I know the IP address and it never changes, I can't get in that way, which is good for security.

749
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:18,532
Scott: So what do we do?

750
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:20,375
Scott: is we enlist some cloud assistance.

751
00:52:20,656 --> 00:52:27,350
Scott: We get some other point out in the cloud somewhere, someone else's computer, or you host your own computer with a colo, I guess, I don't know.

752
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:37,370
Scott: But some other computer on the internet that's accessible from anywhere and your home computers connect to that computer with some sort of VPN.

753
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:41,942
Scott: And then your remote device also connects to that remote computer.

754
00:52:42,363 --> 00:52:44,570
Scott: And now you sort of have a link to go through.

755
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:51,770
Scott: So it's like, okay, I can't connect directly to my house, but my home computer is always connected with a VPN to this computer.

756
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:54,936
Scott: And so am I with, from wherever I am in the world.

757
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:56,840
Scott: And now I can reach my home.

758
00:52:56,921 --> 00:52:59,466
Scott: So tail scale is a really popular thing.

759
00:52:59,506 --> 00:53:01,430
Scott: that does this with WireGuard these days.

760
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:13,390
Scott: It's very, very, it's shockingly easy to use, which is why I think, you know, I didn't know what it was and then I used it and I was like, oh, this is so easy and simple and mostly free.

761
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:16,397
Scott: I can see why this has become a thing, right?

762
00:53:16,517 --> 00:53:22,150
Scott: It's like, you just, any device you have, you just connect to tails, your own tail scale virtual network.

763
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:26,840
Scott: And now it's like you have this other LAN that doesn't really exist.

764
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:31,310
Scott: But because tail scale servers are reachable from anywhere, you're good.

765
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:36,601
Scott: And the tail scale servers theoretically just sort of assist you in making a direct connection.

766
00:53:36,621 --> 00:53:40,530
Scott: Like your traffic, I think mostly doesn't flow through tail scale.

767
00:53:40,611 --> 00:53:42,589
Scott: I think sometimes it does, but mostly it doesn't.

768
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:42,970
Scott: Yeah.

769
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,200
Rym: These kind of services basically get around the need a big beefy wall.

770
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,805
Rym: You leave the beefy wall in place.

771
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:49,349
Rym: Like you just don't open up.

772
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,097
Scott: It's literally impossible.

773
00:53:51,178 --> 00:53:53,268
Scott: You have no ports open to the internet whatsoever.

774
00:53:53,288 --> 00:53:53,690
Scott: Right?

775
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:54,391
Rym: Yeah.

776
00:53:54,431 --> 00:54:04,309
Rym: And because it's the idea of you want the thing in the two separate environments to reach out, to ask for a connection instead of listening for anyone to try to talk to it.

777
00:54:05,211 --> 00:54:05,371
Scott: Yep.

778
00:54:06,012 --> 00:54:09,877
Scott: You just sort of have this third party assistant out there.

779
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:12,300
Scott: that doesn't, you're not storing your data in the cloud.

780
00:54:12,521 --> 00:54:19,450
Scott: You're not running your services in the cloud, but you, all your separate devices all around the world can connect.

781
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:26,149
Scott: And you know, this one sort of orchestrator traffic director can help them make secure connections to each other.

782
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:36,890
Scott: You know, and I guess the only, now your point of failure would be if somebody could authenticate with that service, they could get their device onto your network, your virtual network and then access everything.

783
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,172
Rym: And most services work like that.

784
00:54:39,212 --> 00:54:51,948
Rym: Like even Chrome remote desktop looks like you're, you use a code and it does some stuff, but Google's just the cloud server sitting in the middle, bridging the gap between wherever you are in Chrome and wherever your computer is.

785
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,290
Rym: that's running Chrome remote desktop.

786
00:54:54,011 --> 00:54:54,211
Scott: Yep.

787
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:54,792
Scott: Precisely.

788
00:54:55,693 --> 00:55:01,579
Scott: Um, now the final method, and this is, I may have talked about this as a news, but I've actually been using it for a while.

789
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,584
Scott: Um, and I'm kind of sad that the best implementation is cloud flare.

790
00:55:05,664 --> 00:55:10,710
Scott: Cause I'd love to use one that isn't from that company, but their solution just works really, really well.

791
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:16,581
Scott: And this is the case where you want to host services that are open to the public, right?

792
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:21,750
Scott: I want to run a web server in my house and have people access it from around the world.

793
00:55:22,211 --> 00:55:27,700
Scott: But I don't want to aim my DNS at the IP address of my house, even if it never changes, right?

794
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,226
Scott: I want to keep my house completely locked up, right?

795
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:33,250
Scott: So no packets can come directly to my house.

796
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:34,572
Scott: How is this possible?

797
00:55:34,592 --> 00:55:37,775
Scott: Well, they have a product called cloud fair tunnel, which is shockingly free.

798
00:55:39,017 --> 00:55:46,306
Scott: Um, and the way it works is you run this little demon app on a computer in your home network, right?

799
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:50,090
Scott: And that little app makes a VPN connection to cloud flare.

800
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:50,671
Scott: Okay.

801
00:55:51,412 --> 00:55:53,934
Scott: So now there is a connection between you and cloud flare.

802
00:55:54,475 --> 00:56:07,290
Scott: And so theoretically, if you configure this, people can now reach from anywhere, can now talk to cloud flare, and then cloud flare will talk to the service that is running in your house and expose the service in your house to the wider internet.

803
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:19,466
Scott: Uh, and the way you do this is you go to cloud flares website and you say, Hey, you know, that cloud flare demon running there, it sees a service at this host name relative to it.

804
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,790
Scott: And this, I, this, you know, port relative to it.

805
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:32,523
Scott: I want you to expose that service at this public, you know, space, this public DNS, this public port, right?

806
00:56:32,783 --> 00:56:33,745
Scott: Make that connection.

807
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:37,790
Scott: And it, as long as it's running properly, it sure enough, it makes that connection.

808
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:50,090
Scott: So you could run like the Apache web server on your home network with port 80 exposed to only the local network or even only to the computer that is running the cloud flare demon tunnel thing.

809
00:56:50,931 --> 00:57:03,950
Scott: And then out on cloud flare, you say, Hey, the cloud flare demon that's running there sees a on port 80 on this machine, Scott's web server, a service exposed that on my website.com.

810
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:05,992
Scott: And it happens.

811
00:57:06,053 --> 00:57:16,550
Scott: Anyone who visits my website.com DNS will send them to cloud flares, IP address, cloud flare will see they're coming in and know that they're trying to go to my website.com.

812
00:57:17,131 --> 00:57:26,490
Scott: And then it'll go down through the VPN to that little web service, forward it through the little tunnel app and bring the HTML all the way back and deliver it to the, to the person.

813
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:30,295
Scott: And, but your home network is still completely safe.

814
00:57:30,516 --> 00:57:30,756
Scott: Right.

815
00:57:31,337 --> 00:57:33,520
Scott: Uh, and that's a pretty powerful technology.

816
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:36,305
Scott: Many people, there's actually a GitHub link.

817
00:57:36,325 --> 00:57:39,410
Scott: Someone's like collected a list of everyone who offers this kind of service.

818
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:52,369
Scott: Um, and the thing is most of them are only offering it in such a way where it's only useful for like, I'm doing web development work and I'm running a little web server locally and I want to show it to my client quickly.

819
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:53,090
Scott: Right.

820
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:57,037
Scott: The very few, pretty much cloud flare is the only easy one.

821
00:57:57,237 --> 00:58:00,123
Scott: that's doing it to where I have a permanent service running.

822
00:58:00,784 --> 00:58:01,024
Scott: Right.

823
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:03,910
Scott: That I want to actually be good and work and not have it.

824
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:08,354
Scott: Things change on it or have to use, I want to use my actual domain on it.

825
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:23,310
Rym: Well, plus I think what you're doing, like that kind of setup is going to be more important as parts of the internet and platforms that people use start to implode of being able to directly provide services at scale that are nerdy and local and fun.

826
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:27,936
Scott: I think the downside of this pattern, cause it's, it's an amazing pattern, right?

827
00:58:28,056 --> 00:58:36,909
Scott: Besides the, uh, if the, if someone else offered this service besides cloud flare, that would solve a lot of the single point of failure problems.

828
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:37,310
Scott: Right.

829
00:58:38,151 --> 00:58:48,807
Scott: Um, but I think the other problem is that even if you're, you know, your, your ISP is like cool with this or they can't detect it cause it's all just a VPN.

830
00:58:48,827 --> 00:58:50,390
Scott: It looks like you're just VPN-ing over to work.

831
00:58:51,011 --> 00:59:00,170
Scott: If you start doing high bandwidth stuff, you get a lot of visitors to your website that runs in your house, your regular old residential ISP, even if you have a lot of upstream.

832
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:00,310
Scott: Yeah.

833
00:59:00,351 --> 00:59:06,470
Rym: Your, your Verizon files gig was symmetric gigabit is going to get cut the fuck off if you're hosting YouTube.

834
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:15,725
Scott: Even if you pay for the symmetric gigabit, if you start doing like live streaming video from your house, uh, you know, it's like you.

835
00:59:15,765 --> 00:59:18,990
Scott: better have some sort of other thing out in front of that, like a CDN.

836
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:21,312
Scott: Right.

837
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:27,601
Scott: Because otherwise you're going to be putting out the full bandwidth per visitor from your house that, you know, get out of your architecture.

838
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:27,862
Scott: Right.

839
00:59:27,922 --> 00:59:33,310
Scott: If you get a, even just a website, if peoples are visiting that website too much, that's going to be trouble.

840
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:44,829
Scott: So, um, but yeah, I think the other thing is a lot of people do want is to, you know, they're running like obviously the Plex piracy kind of server deals.

841
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:45,370
Scott: Right.

842
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:50,617
Scott: Um, and where you want to expose it to some people, but not all the people.

843
00:59:51,639 --> 00:59:59,910
Scott: in which case, I think the tail scale sort of model where it's like you have a LAN where the limited number of people can get on the LAN and then you run services on this virtual LAN.

844
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,094
Scott: And one of those services is your piracy.

845
01:00:04,756 --> 01:00:07,180
Scott: Uh, I think a lot of people do that exactly that way.

846
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:07,581
Scott: Right.

847
01:00:07,601 --> 01:00:13,550
Scott: They have a Plex in their house, but people have a way to connect to it, um, without exposing it to the whole fricking internet.

848
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:32,750
Rym: So I guess the thing you should do if you think you need remote access to anything, just generally, because you're listening to this episode to the end, you didn't just turn it off when we started talking about this, is you need to really just define exactly in detail, what are you trying to accomplish and why.

849
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,234
Scott: And then that's, that's the same with everything.

850
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:45,410
Rym: I mean, that is, I could just record that and stick it to the end of literally every GeekNights episode, how to do anything, determine what you want to accomplish and why.

851
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,451
Scott: Yes, the end.

852
01:00:49,213 --> 01:01:03,389
Scott: Uh, but yeah, I would recommend that in the year 2023 that you, you know, if you have truly sensitive things or like a reason to do things from your house, cost savings is a reason.

853
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:04,770
Scott: the cloud for tunnels free, right?

854
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:12,145
Scott: So if you have low traffic websites, you can host them for free, um, uh, and determine like if it's piracy, yeah, do that from your house.

855
01:01:12,185 --> 01:01:14,590
Scott: Don't host your pirated movies on some cloud provider, right?

856
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:20,443
Scott: It's like, but if you don't need to do it from your house, doing it from your house is just a more of a pain in the ass.

857
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:23,109
Scott: So pay money to do it from the cloud and stuff.

858
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:33,650
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

859
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:38,910
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion, news, and more.

860
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,857
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

861
01:01:41,997 --> 01:01:46,610
Rym: SciTech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.

862
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:50,957
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license.

863
01:01:51,398 --> 01:01:57,570
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

864
01:01:58,171 --> 01:02:19,230
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Linky G, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Case Care, Makes Music, Christa Dodd, Christopher Orr, Clinton Walton, M Def Mac, Finn, Joel Hayes, Penny Reimer, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Horl, and a bunch of people who are below the threshold probably to get access to that sweet Patreon RSS feed.

865
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:21,775
Rym: So yeah, keep giving us feedback on the website.

866
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:22,998
Rym: We're going to keep improving it.

867
01:02:23,879 --> 01:02:29,050
Rym: Now that it's live, we can move a lot faster because we don't have to continuously also keep the old one running.

868
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:40,510
Rym: So for now, tonight, I'll just leave you with... People only say Ubuntu's for beginners because they want to feel superior.

869
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:46,370
Scott: I also say Ubuntu's for beginners because I also want to feel superior.

870
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:47,973
Scott: That's a nice what you got there.

871
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:49,738
Scott: Want me to turn it into a web server?

872
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:54,510
Scott: If you want to turn your old Pentium beige box into a web server, I got just the tool for you.

873
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:55,808
Scott: Have you heard of Linux?

874
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:57,576
Rym: I'd just like to interject for a moment.

875
01:02:57,596 --> 01:03:00,169
Scott: What you're referring to as Linux is in fact GNU Linux.

876
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:00,854
Scott: Linux.

877
01:03:01,036 --> 01:03:01,603
Scott: I mean GNU/Linux.

878
01:03:02,451 --> 01:03:02,855
Scott: Linux.

879
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:03,745
Scott: I mean GNU/Linux.

880
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,160
Scott: I mean GNU+Linux.

881
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:07,298
Scott: These are GNU-tils.

882
01:03:07,641 --> 01:03:08,850
Scott: That's not Linux's fault.

883
01:03:09,111 --> 01:03:10,133
Scott: Linux is just a kernel.

884
01:03:10,314 --> 01:03:16,950
Scott: That's the fault of GNOME, X11, GCC, libGC, KGB, KDE, GRUB, Java, Pac-Man.

885
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:17,651
Scott: No, the game.

886
01:03:17,772 --> 01:03:18,995
Scott: The package manager is fine.

887
01:03:19,075 --> 01:03:24,730
Scott: LibreOffice, Firefox, Pulse Audio, System D, Incompetence, System D, Nvidia.

888
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:31,050
Scott: At this point, GNU and Linux are just small parts of the System D operating system.
