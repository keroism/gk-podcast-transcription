1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,725
Rym: It's Monday, March 27th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:12,252
Rym: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:20,110
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about archiving the internet.

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,854
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:31,683
Rym: So, uh, when COVID hit a few years ago, the, uh, one of the first things I did was cancel my subscription to the local rock climbing gym.

6
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:35,801
Rym: Cause like, you know, if you, if you have ever used a gym, gyms ain't cheap.

7
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:41,346
Rym: Anyway, like in most of America, gyms are already pretty expensive in New York and the way gyms make money.

8
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:42,672
Scott: We've talked about this before.

9
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:47,495
Scott: Get a lot of people to subscribe and get memberships, even though only a small portion of them show up.

10
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:57,255
Rym: If they all show up, the gym will be in trouble, but you know, it is way more expensive than just a gym in New York City, a rock climbing gym, because those are really expensive.

11
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:58,159
Scott: It's much more.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,076
Scott: if the equipment is much, you know, you can't just buy a giant warehouse.

13
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:04,766
Rym: You need like 40, 50 foot walls.

14
00:01:04,806 --> 00:01:09,560
Rym: You need a lot of more insurance, hella more insurance, more staff.

15
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:12,250
Rym: So I'll just give you an example right now.

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,787
Scott: Just let people run free in a room full of, you know, rock climbing.

17
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:17,919
Scott: The way you let them run free in a room full of treadmills, right?

18
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:22,259
Rym: Like you're not even allowed in until you prove that, you know, the basics like.

19
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,049
Rym: otherwise you're a risk to yourself and everyone around you in these places.

20
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:25,872
Scott: Yep.

21
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:30,168
Rym: So, uh, I canceled that basically instantly when COVID happened.

22
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:39,824
Rym: And uh, yeah, as of a couple of weekends ago, I have resigned up actually for a different rock climbing gym, New York City, the most convenient one.

23
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:42,918
Rym: There was one a few blocks away, like not too far away.

24
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:56,965
Rym: Like it wasn't a problem and it was kind of the better gym, but I got to tell you a 15 minute walk versus a 45 second walk is a surprisingly big difference in terms of, Oh, finish with GeekNights and you'll be ready in 20 minutes.

25
00:01:57,407 --> 00:02:00,502
Rym: I'm just going to walk downstairs and climb for 10 minutes and then come home.

26
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,525
Rym: Like that is great.

27
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:06,943
Rym: But uh, yeah, that's $120 a month to have access to that place.

28
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:09,257
Rym: But I saved a lot of money over the last three years.

29
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,126
Scott: As long as you use it $120 a month, it's okay.

30
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:12,347
Scott: Right?

31
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:16,418
Scott: I mean, my, the Zwift virtual bike world, right?

32
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,076
Scott: Costs, let me see, I forget what it costs and I know you use the hell out of it.

33
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:20,881
Rym: I see you using it.

34
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:24,817
Scott: I use it basically whenever the weather is not good and I want to ride bike.

35
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:29,732
Scott: It costs $16 and 32 cents a month after all taxes and bullshit.

36
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:33,245
Scott: Uh, but you have to amortize obviously the cost of the equipment.

37
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,897
Scott: So, but you can choose your equipment, right?

38
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:38,167
Scott: I happened to choose the bike trainer.

39
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:39,694
Scott: That was many hundreds of dollars.

40
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:41,040
Scott: Maybe it was even a thousand dollars.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,703
Rym: Which makes sense.

42
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:43,920
Rym: You know, what are we talking about on gig nights if you're into something?

43
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:49,645
Scott: and I guess, but you know, there's the cost of the bicycle also, but the bicycle is also used for outside bicycling.

44
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:49,986
Scott: Yep.

45
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,015
Scott: Um, but that's your hobby.

46
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:55,727
Rym: Like spend the money to have the good equipment if you can afford it.

47
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:56,230
Scott: Okay.

48
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,441
Scott: But yeah, they sell this Zwift hub now, which is only $500.

49
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,424
Scott: Right?

50
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,613
Scott: So that's not bad deal.

51
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:03,054
Scott: Yeah.

52
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:05,581
Rym: Of course there is plenty of free ride climbing.

53
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:14,358
Scott: It's way cheaper than a gym and it's way better than basically biking in any, any gym membership I could get would not have a biking experience superior to this.

54
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:21,084
Rym: It's going to have one of those regular stationary exercise bikes and like a row of treadmills and a row of ellipticals.

55
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:22,208
Scott: Right.

56
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:22,690
Scott: So there's.

57
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,269
Rym: no, my building has treadmills and exercise bikes downstairs if I wanted to use them.

58
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:27,651
Scott: That's free.

59
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:30,727
Scott: I mean, yeah, my bike, my gym and our building has two bikes.

60
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:31,672
Scott: I use, I use them.

61
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:37,852
Scott: They're not actually, they're pretty, they're like pretty damn good for a stationary exercise bike.

62
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:40,680
Scott: Um, but they're not a trainer.

63
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,448
Rym: They're not the same kind of experience.

64
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:45,926
Rym: Plus you're not just like in your own apartment for going as long as you want.

65
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:47,754
Rym: Like you don't have to go downstairs.

66
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,382
Scott: There isn't, you know, a virtual bike world.

67
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:51,023
Scott: Yeah.

68
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:58,018
Scott: It's not, you know, it's like, so I'm feeling it, but I got to say literally riding on my bicycle.

69
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:01,530
Rym: I, uh, I also did my first run of the season.

70
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,438
Rym: Uh, you know, finally got warm enough.

71
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:11,739
Rym: So I ran like 11 miles and I didn't lose any conditioning over the winter cause I've been working out like hell for like three and a half years because of COVID and being stuck mostly at home.

72
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:17,563
Rym: But, uh, climbing I have not done in three years and that isn't just like, Oh, my arms are weak.

73
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:25,152
Rym: That is like, it uses very specific muscles and tendons that normally don't get really worked at all in a normal person's life.

74
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:37,308
Rym: So yeah, there's a lot of pain and I have lost a lot of ability there and I'm doing like V2 on the wall on a scale of between zero and infinity.

75
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:38,813
Rym: Zero is like walking up a stairway.

76
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,690
Rym: Two is like normal rock climbing that people would do a bouldering I guess.

77
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:45,683
Rym: And then the scale is theoretically unlimited above that.

78
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:51,810
Rym: Never done higher than a V5 in my life and I don't plan to, but, uh, yeah, I pretty much lost every one of those muscles.

79
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,394
Scott: So they just make up numbers like the, I guess there's some of us criteria for what number they can give something.

80
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:08,693
Rym: It's not really scientific, but it's sort of agreed upon by the bouldering community and it's roughly, from my understanding, based on everyone agrees that some trail is a particular rating.

81
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:12,472
Scott: Did they change, did they change the V based on like what equipment you use?

82
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:14,799
Scott: Like if I make it easier for myself.

83
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:15,682
Scott: Okay.

84
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,146
Scott: So no time, no ropes.

85
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:20,862
Rym: Just all you got is climbing shoes, chalk and your body and nothing else.

86
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:21,886
Scott: All right.

87
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:28,073
Scott: So what would like, so you're saying like the infinity would be like climbing Olympus mods with just your body and nothing else.

88
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:33,516
Rym: They basically make a new rating when someone does something that no one else had ever done before.

89
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:38,417
Rym: Then they figure out was that materially harder than the least, the next lowest down.

90
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:51,432
Rym: Is there an official rock climbing association that sort of, uh, it's kind of complicated and like it's different between the U S and Europe, but, and they actually use different systems, but the ratings are actually surprisingly consistent.

91
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:58,886
Rym: Like if I go anywhere in the world and I do a V2 or whatever the local equivalent of V2 is, they're about the same level of difficulty.

92
00:05:58,906 --> 00:05:59,610
Rym: Do you know what they're like?

93
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,102
Rym: They're a lot like the original step ratings in DDR.

94
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:06,676
Rym: Like if I tell you who is like, you're really good at DDR, you played it a lot.

95
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,443
Rym: This is a seven footer.

96
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:12,823
Rym: You have a very good understanding of what that's going to be like to do an eight footer.

97
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:13,587
Scott: It's hard.

98
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:16,019
Scott: If you just started playing DDR, there's no way you're going to do it.

99
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:25,906
Scott: Like if you play DDR a bunch, it's like, you know, you're gonna, you're gonna do it and be, but it's, you know, if you're one of those people who does the really ridiculous songs, it's gonna be really easy.

100
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:32,193
Rym: It's an easy, it's like a shooting star and an eight would be more like music and a nine would be like dropout.

101
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,104
Rym: So bouldering sign of the same way.

102
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:38,936
Rym: But uh, yeah, my hand, my wrists hurt more than they've hurt in a long time.

103
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,481
Scott: You'll get new wrists.

104
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,227
Rym: Hey, robot body.

105
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:42,548
Scott: Yeah.

106
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,365
Scott: So over the weekend I went, I just want to comment quickly, right?

107
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,914
Scott: I went to this affordable art fair that I heard about.

108
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:50,597
Rym: Oh yeah.

109
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:55,775
Scott: And basically it's sort of like a gallery but not sort of not.

110
00:06:55,876 --> 00:07:00,334
Scott: basically what happens is it's almost like a convention in some ways, but only a dealer's room.

111
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,409
Scott: Um, it was a lot like mocha fest only, you know, right.

112
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:06,634
Scott: People show up to fend, right?

113
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:11,453
Scott: And they basically, instead of your booth being like a table at a con, right?

114
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:16,633
Scott: You display your wares, the booths were like these sort of like little rooms, right?

115
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:17,034
Scott: You would get.

116
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:18,901
Scott: basically each booth in.

117
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:27,067
Scott: each hallway was like a rectangle, but what the short side of the rectangle was missing and was facing the main hallway.

118
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:35,080
Scott: And then she had this deep rectangle with white walls that are all the way up to the ceiling and you hang your arts, right?

119
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,807
Scott: Most of it is hung square arts.

120
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,837
Scott: There were some other sculpture type things, right?

121
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:39,521
Scott: And whatnot, right?

122
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:49,402
Scott: But you just hang your arts in there and you know, maybe you make a little tiny table with your business cards and you know, you're, you stand there selling your arts, right?

123
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:54,745
Scott: Some of them were artists, some of them were like gallery owners representing artists, things of that nature.

124
00:07:55,388 --> 00:08:06,210
Scott: And when they say affordable art fair, right, they mean like, yes, you know, normally you would go to an art auction and pay tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for an art, right?

125
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:11,528
Scott: Whereas here you're only paying single thousands of dollars for the arts, right?

126
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:14,543
Rym: Which is a little more reasonable in terms of the price of wanting to enjoy something.

127
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:29,330
Rym: A thing, this is again, personal opinion, not investment advice or professional opinion, but a very expensive art tends to be, it tends to reek of money laundering and asset hiding more so than people actually valuing the arts that much.

128
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:37,143
Scott: The reason that these arts cost many thousands, right, is because if you think about it, the person who made it is only an artist, right?

129
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:40,726
Scott: And it's like, if you're, let's say you're an artist who's making, you know, oil paintings.

130
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:41,813
Rym: Yeah.

131
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:42,650
Rym: How long does that take?

132
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,571
Scott: Right.

133
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:44,476
Scott: How long does that take?

134
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,507
Scott: How many can you make in a year, right?

135
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,878
Scott: Well, let's say you can make 30 a year, right?

136
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:56,910
Scott: Well, if you sell them for $1,000 each and you're like not even accounting for materials or any other costs or anything.

137
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,570
Rym: That's less money than Seymour Skinner canonically makes.

138
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,437
Scott: That's only $30,000 a year.

139
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:03,988
Scott: That's, it's like, and how many can you make in a year?

140
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:04,128
Scott: Right?

141
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,255
Scott: It's like, you need to either crank out a lot of them or make, you know, but if you're cranking it a lot, how good are they?

142
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:10,837
Scott: Right?

143
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:21,290
Rym: So it's like, you need a very fundamental question around how labor is allocated around value based pricing versus effort based pricing.

144
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:22,173
Scott: Right.

145
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:27,591
Scott: So, but just out of necessity, a lot of these arts were, you know, 2000, 4008. that, right.

146
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:35,706
Scott: But that's affordable for an actual original art, not a, you know, some of them were photographic prints, but they're still like what that photograph people do.

147
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:40,388
Scott: is they even the, the photo, the paint people also, but it's like they do limited.

148
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:45,466
Scott: They're like, I'm only going to let anyone print this photo out big, like five times.

149
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:46,088
Scott: That's it.

150
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:55,785
Scott: So like you can be guaranteed that this fucking awesome photo I took and spent a whole of a lot of time photoshopping and making awesome will only ever be printed out.

151
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:59,236
Scott: It's big enough to put on someone's wall, right?

152
00:09:59,597 --> 00:10:05,737
Rym: Usually they're also framed really well in a complimentary way to what the photo is about.

153
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:07,304
Scott: You pay extra for the framing, right?

154
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:11,194
Scott: But like the one really cool one I saw there, let me see if I can get the name of them.

155
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:15,122
Scott: Uh, where's the name here?

156
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:16,426
Scott: Oh, here it is.

157
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:17,229
Scott: Dan.

158
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:24,029
Scott: I'm not, sorry, Dan, if I mispronounced your last name, Dan P H P I E C H concrete canvas.

159
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:32,116
Scott: It's vast photos.com/concrete, but this, what this person does is they walk around this Manhattan city, New York, right?

160
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:44,656
Scott: And they look at the concrete, the sidewalk, the street, et cetera, mostly the sidewalk and looking for like interesting, just naturally occurring compositions that are on the street.

161
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,040
Rym: Ooh, that's a good shake.

162
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:47,708
Scott: They discover them, right?

163
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:48,372
Scott: They don't make them.

164
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:50,365
Scott: They're not like splashing paint on the ground or anything.

165
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:53,864
Scott: They're just walking around, looking around with a regular old camera, right?

166
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,442
Scott: Looking for like an interesting composition that would look really great blown up large.

167
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:06,206
Scott: And when they find one with a regular camera, they come back right with like some ridiculous camera.

168
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:12,888
Scott: That's like ridiculous, ridiculous resolution that aims straight down and then they make right.

169
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,346
Scott: And you can, if you go to their website, it's like, it's like, I would hang that on my wall.

170
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:27,954
Scott: It's like, even though it's just a picture of the concrete outside and then dissolve, if you go to the website, it'll tell you like, ah, you want to print this and it shows you how many they've made, right?

171
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,460
Scott: It's like, it's a limited edition.

172
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,573
Scott: That's how they can get away with charging X thousand dollars.

173
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:36,951
Rym: It's almost like we can do that without making a fucking NFT to go with it.

174
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:37,855
Scott: Yeah.

175
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,201
Scott: I mean, it's not even NFT, right?

176
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:47,282
Scott: I'm sure if you went to Dan and he like he had some limited run where he'd only did five and he already did the five and you were like, listen, I really want that exact one.

177
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,430
Scott: He'll be like for enough money.

178
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,167
Scott: He'd be like, okay, I got the raw file in Photoshop over here.

179
00:11:55,689 --> 00:12:06,010
Scott: You know, but no, we saw a lot of like, there were many, many arts there that, you know, no matter what your style is, you would, you would see something there that's like, damn, I want that on my wall.

180
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:14,122
Scott: And then the only thing stopping you from hanging it on your wall would be, it's still thousands of dollars, but I saw a lot of awesome biz there.

181
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:17,872
Scott: Uh, it made me wish I was a little more wealthy.

182
00:12:19,977 --> 00:12:22,426
Rym: So in the news, there's a lot going on.

183
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:30,496
Rym: We're only gonna cover a few of these things, but I want to start with the big one, this whole tick tock band, which is not new.

184
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:45,413
Rym: Like this has been in the works and rumbling for a long time now, but it's coming to fruition and a lot of people started noticing it partly because there was just a big congressional hearing where American Congress people were asking the CEO of tick tock questions.

185
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:53,968
Rym: And of course, American Congress people, with the exception of like five of them, don't fucking have any idea how any technology made after 1945 works.

186
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:54,791
Scott: Yep.

187
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:57,060
Scott: So basically this congressional hearing was interesting.

188
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,143
Scott: I usually watch all the technology related hearings, especially when there's something like this involved.

189
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:02,384
Scott: Right.

190
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:10,377
Scott: But this one was interesting in that, first of all, most of the hearings I've seen is usually Democrats versus Republicans.

191
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:10,598
Scott: Right.

192
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:12,405
Scott: They're not on the same side of the deal.

193
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:12,987
Scott: Right.

194
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:21,878
Scott: Or at least, you know, if they are on the same side, they have some sort of strong divergence, like the one where they were going to point.

195
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,911
Rym: Republicans and Democrats both want to increase military funding.

196
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:28,347
Rym: They want to do very different things with what that military is.

197
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:28,568
Scott: Right.

198
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:32,023
Scott: Like I watch I think I watch an antitrust hearing against the big tech.

199
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:32,404
Scott: Right.

200
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:35,598
Scott: And the Democrats are like, you're a monopoly or anti-competitive.

201
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:36,180
Scott: Right.

202
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:41,080
Scott: You're using your search results, Google, to keep other businesses down, et cetera, et cetera.

203
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,401
Scott: Right.

204
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,144
Scott: That sort of thing.

205
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:45,858
Scott: And the Republicans come in, you know, like the worst ones.

206
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,211
Scott: also the worst ones are at this hearing.

207
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:50,436
Scott: They happen to be on that committee.

208
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:50,797
Scott: Right.

209
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:55,274
Scott: And they're coming in like, oh, you're censoring the conservative voices.

210
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:55,635
Scott: Right.

211
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:56,699
Scott: It's like they're.

212
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,641
Scott: they're both against the people that are testifying, but they're completely off base from each other.

213
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:03,842
Scott: Right.

214
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:04,344
Scott: Whereas here.

215
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:05,468
Scott: Right.

216
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:16,690
Scott: It's like you sort of have two different things going on at this hearing that are sort of both simultaneously true, which is that the Congress people are technologically incompetent.

217
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:20,849
Scott: They're asking all sorts of stupid questions that are meaningless.

218
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,140
Scott: And you're sort of want to side with tick tock on that.

219
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:28,321
Scott: But secondly, they're coming at the tick tock people for like, is this a national security threat?

220
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:30,088
Scott: Are you a danger to?

221
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,292
Scott: are you spying for China?

222
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,761
Scott: It's like, is there some evidence of that?

223
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:35,586
Scott: You know, yes and no.

224
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:36,107
Scott: Right.

225
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:41,402
Scott: I guess I think there's my gut, you know, well, have information.

226
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:42,466
Rym: There's a lot.

227
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:48,204
Scott: My gut tells me that the way that I've seen people in government acting right.

228
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:56,204
Scott: People who aren't ridiculous tells me in my completely the opinion of some guy.

229
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:56,847
Scott: Right.

230
00:14:56,907 --> 00:15:01,145
Scott: For whatever that counts for is that they must know something the public doesn't know.

231
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:04,057
Scott: There must be some government information.

232
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:04,177
Scott: Right.

233
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:15,179
Scott: That the some federal agency has discovered regarding tick tock that has been in briefings to Congress people or others that is not known to the public.

234
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:24,511
Scott: Well, remember, we have a good that leads them to have a good reason to believe that, yes, indeed, ByteDance is the company that owns tick tock.

235
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:24,712
Scott: Right.

236
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:25,053
Rym: Yep.

237
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:25,936
Scott: Yep.

238
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:30,712
Scott: That they are in some way acting on behalf of the government.

239
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,582
Rym: They are beholden to the government of China.

240
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,591
Scott: At the very least, you know that for sure.

241
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:36,033
Scott: Right.

242
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:36,957
Scott: But that's just.

243
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:40,411
Scott: that's like saying Google is beholden to the United States, which is also true.

244
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:40,973
Scott: Right.

245
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,241
Scott: So that doesn't mean much.

246
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:43,502
Scott: There's.

247
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:49,689
Scott: but what's really being beholden to a foreign government means that you shouldn't do business with a company.

248
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,901
Scott: That means you can't do business with any company that's not.

249
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,431
Rym: Well, it wouldn't matter normally.

250
00:15:54,451 --> 00:16:06,902
Rym: The reason this is mattering to a lot of interest and why this is a topic of debate and discussion now is partly because the world is starting to align once again into three blocks, very similar to what happened during the Cold War.

251
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:12,083
Rym: This has been ongoing for a few years, but it's it's escalating rapidly over even the last year.

252
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,552
Rym: The Ukraine war, of course, pushed this.

253
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:28,292
Rym: But we're generally seeing a block consisting of effectively NATO and NATO line countries and the bulk of the United Nations, as well as most of the large powers in Asia Pacific.

254
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:35,644
Rym: That's sort of like block one, say, first world, because for the listener who might be unaware that we call the first world now, that's the golf playing world.

255
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:36,106
Rym: Yep.

256
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:45,300
Rym: Well, so that's a different because the problem is first world, second world, third world originally meant are you in block one, block two or unaffiliated?

257
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,731
Rym: Like it didn't have anything to do with economic development.

258
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,077
Rym: And that was sort of like.

259
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,826
Rym: that was added later.

260
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,741
Rym: And people use these terms incorrectly for so long that they fucked it up.

261
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,971
Scott: So but now we can't use those terms.

262
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:59,566
Scott: now, there's regardless of regardless of the etymology, it doesn't matter now.

263
00:16:59,646 --> 00:16:59,927
Scott: Right.

264
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:02,959
Scott: So I like the term the golf playing nations.

265
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:11,525
Rym: Those are the many golf playing nations who are in the second block because the second block is Russia, China.

266
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:11,806
Rym: Yeah.

267
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:14,876
Rym: And a number of other powers Iran is aligning with.

268
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,282
Rym: India is getting a little weird about this.

269
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:18,708
Scott: And so there's the.

270
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:33,455
Scott: there's the vote, the somewhat to some degree democratic golf playing nations and the somewhat to some degree autocratic nations is the rest of the world who are unaffiliated golf, the non-golf nations.

271
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,041
Scott: They don't have golf course.

272
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:43,258
Rym: A lot of the third block countries also have golf courses, but they don't want to be involved in a fight between two giant mega blocks of the rest of the world.

273
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:45,868
Rym: They would rather just not have to deal with that.

274
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:46,972
Scott: Anyway, the point is.

275
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:47,674
Scott: All right.

276
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:51,928
Scott: The point is this right on the topic of should you ban TikTok?

277
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:52,149
Scott: Right.

278
00:17:52,189 --> 00:18:05,696
Scott: Well, if it is true that TikTok does pose a national security threat, we've already taken the very sane and correct measure of saying you should not have this on government owned devices that may have important data.

279
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:08,446
Scott: And I think that that's really too lenient.

280
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:14,491
Scott: It should be that these are the list of apps that should be on a government phone or device and no others, period.

281
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:14,893
Scott: Right.

282
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:17,583
Scott: It's like that seems just just common sense computer security.

283
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:19,127
Scott: So that's the first thing.

284
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:35,480
Scott: The second thing is if it does really pose some sort of national security threat, they're spying on Americans and, you know, doing something shady on behalf of another nation, then it's like, well, I guess we kind of have to do something about.

285
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,324
Scott: here's a tricky.

286
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:37,832
Scott: You can't just let them get away with that.

287
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:39,220
Scott: I'm not done with the list of things.

288
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,641
Scott: All right.

289
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:41,969
Rym: There's a real tricky question underlying all of this.

290
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:42,551
Scott: Right.

291
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:47,991
Scott: The next question right is, well, are they is that a thing?

292
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:48,733
Scott: It could be.

293
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:49,878
Scott: It might not be right.

294
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:51,463
Scott: We don't have the full data on that.

295
00:18:51,643 --> 00:19:02,518
Scott: There might be some secret data, but there is also appears to be some other motive for getting rid of tick tock in that it poses an economic threat in that ha ha.

296
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,681
Scott: The United States, sort of all the big tech companies that were providing major platforms were in the U.S.

297
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:09,525
Scott: up until this point.

298
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:10,871
Scott: Google, Apple, Facebook.

299
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:11,051
Scott: Right.

300
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:12,498
Rym: It's not a Twitter threat.

301
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,213
Rym: It's not like a no pure competition because no, but it's still it's an American.

302
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:26,826
Scott: All the previous companies that were big, at least, at least, you know, big, interesting note, multiple European nations are going down the same road.

303
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,475
Rym: France just announced a ban on government.

304
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:30,645
Rym: Basically, France just announced all the stuff the U.S.

305
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:31,870
Rym: did a while ago recently.

306
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,086
Rym: And a number of European countries are similarly planning to ban tick tock.

307
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:36,788
Scott: Sure.

308
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:41,082
Scott: OK, so but, you know, is there some other motive for banning it?

309
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,652
Scott: because you want to protect protectionism against the U.S.

310
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:45,795
Scott: platforms?

311
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:46,076
Scott: Right.

312
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:49,629
Scott: And who knows if that's true or not, probably at least partially.

313
00:19:50,031 --> 00:20:00,632
Scott: And then the final question is, well, we still have net neutrality to discuss here, which is like, hey, you know, should you really, you know, shouldn't we me a person with Internet access?

314
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:01,275
Scott: Right.

315
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:06,835
Scott: It's like, aren't you in some way being like China if you were to block tick tock the way China blocks things?

316
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:07,578
Scott: Right.

317
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:11,030
Scott: It's like, well, you say China's bad for their great wall.

318
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:14,141
Scott: Well, if you block tick tock, isn't that hypocrisy, right?

319
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:25,429
Scott: People, average normal people should be able to access the whole of the Internet at their own choosing for better or for worse.

320
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,435
Rym: Yeah, but it's like a tricky question.

321
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:29,402
Rym: So, for example, the U.S.

322
00:20:29,502 --> 00:20:33,956
Rym: and many countries block known malware botnets that are based in Russia.

323
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,947
Rym: We've done that for some time under national security.

324
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:40,942
Scott: But it also depends on what the exact implementation of the block is.

325
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:52,579
Scott: Are you actually you are demanding that all of these private ISP companies block, you know, change their routers to block all packets going to and from some set of IP addresses?

326
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,161
Rym: Probably not.

327
00:20:53,281 --> 00:21:01,988
Scott: Are you removing DNS entries from ISPs, you know, DNS servers and that someone using a different DNS server or know who knows?

328
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:10,565
Rym: Because that gets into this question of in the U.S with the First Amendment, you may have a right to access the data, but nobody is obligated, including the government to make.

329
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:12,335
Scott: Well, they have a right to publish the data.

330
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,445
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't mean you have a right to access it.

331
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:17,015
Scott: Arguably, it's a right to speech, not a right to listening.

332
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,405
Rym: Well, that actually gets a little thorny.

333
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:22,498
Rym: But another thing around the band is more likely.

334
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:26,296
Rym: what would happen is it would be forced out of all the app stores because that's easy to do.

335
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:26,638
Scott: You can.

336
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:31,635
Scott: That's something because the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, right?

337
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,662
Scott: The app stores are places of commerce.

338
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:35,569
Scott: Congress is pretty much unlimited.

339
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:41,692
Scott: If it has laws, at least they can regulate commerce all day, which and they can say you may not sell that.

340
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:43,619
Scott: And even though it's free, it's still.

341
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:44,845
Rym: Now, why would you do this?

342
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:57,210
Rym: This gets into thorny questions from earlier, because if it's an economic issue, sanctions, sanctioned entities like if you're an American, you can't do business or interact in commerce with a sanctioned entity.

343
00:21:57,591 --> 00:21:58,053
Rym: And it's right.

344
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:58,655
Rym: Right.

345
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:00,884
Scott: So if I can't I can't open up a company.

346
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:01,607
Scott: Right.

347
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:07,495
Scott: Like, you know, there's a lot of French animation studios that I don't know if they still do, but they did for they would outsource animation.

348
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:11,392
Rym: Last I checked, I want to say that petered out partly because North Korea has been nuking again.

349
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:12,798
Scott: It could could be.

350
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:15,932
Scott: I don't know what the status of it is, but it was a thing at a time.

351
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:17,439
Scott: Yeah, at least I know that for sure.

352
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:26,868
Scott: But like an American, you had you at Disney could never do that as because even if they wanted to be at any point in time, at least not since the Korean War, because laws.

353
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:37,509
Rym: So here's a funny you can do pretty easily if you talk to the right people.

354
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,993
Rym: I could go to Cuba.

355
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,779
Scott: I cannot.

356
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,042
Scott: Well, now you can.

357
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:48,687
Rym: It was I was loosened a little bit in recent times, but you know what I cannot do because of sanctions that are still in place.

358
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:53,749
Rym: I cannot do any work while I'm there for any American company, no matter what.

359
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:00,540
Rym: It would be against the law for me to accept a phone call that might have been from a coworker while I'm there, even on my own personal device.

360
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:04,959
Scott: You can go there and lay on the beach, though I could, which I would which I would love to do.

361
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:15,340
Rym: I still think one of the greatest travesties in American history is the extent to which we fucked over Cuba solely to prevent them from succeeding as a communist state near the US.

362
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,906
Rym: Not to say that Cuba was perfect.

363
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:18,271
Rym: Far from it.

364
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,829
Rym: But the US did not make the situation particularly better or help in any way.

365
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:23,592
Rym: But I digress.

366
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:27,590
Rym: That's a topic for a show with people who know more about geopolitics than me and Scott.

367
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:33,090
Scott: But so on the topic of the TikTok ban, should they do it?

368
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,575
Scott: Well, should they do it?

369
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:40,556
Scott: Depends a lot, at least for me, on what the it is, what technical measures will they be taking to ban it?

370
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:44,608
Rym: I bet we're going to bite down as an entity.

371
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:44,889
Scott: Right.

372
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:52,231
Scott: And to what is the evidence for the, you know, whatever bad thing that they claim.

373
00:23:52,271 --> 00:24:01,240
Rym: So here's the here's where the original authority thing that I'm unpacking the heap, the stack of concerns that I could raise along the way.

374
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Rym: So one of the arguments about TikTok being a national security threat isn't just that it spies on people because all social media like TikTok has access to all the children with the propaganda.

375
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:14,447
Rym: Yeah, it's the propaganda.

376
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:15,030
Rym: It is that.

377
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:17,020
Scott: But what propaganda is there on TikTok?

378
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:25,351
Scott: The only TikTok I look at is like a dermatologist who's an actual dermatologist because you and me and weirdos who curate our feeds do not.

379
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:28,885
Scott: Is there really Chinese propaganda on TikTok that's getting to the American children?

380
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:35,108
Rym: It's partly more around what is not on TikTok, like what is banned versus not banned.

381
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:36,553
Rym: They can shape narratives.

382
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:37,596
Rym: They don't.

383
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:57,445
Rym: There's an argument that if China, say, decides as a government to invade Taiwan at some point or economic sanctions increase or weird stuff happens, does the US as a defensive posture want a Chinese government directed app to have direct access to millions of American social media feeds in this manner?

384
00:24:57,485 --> 00:25:05,094
Rym: That is one of the concerns that is actively being discussed in the actual debates because this hearing was just a public sort of showcase.

385
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:07,385
Rym: The real debates are happening in committees right now.

386
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:08,492
Rym: We're not going to see all that.

387
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:09,860
Rym: You can read a lot of transcripts.

388
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:18,960
Rym: I have not done that because as interested as I am in the deep details of geopolitics, even I could not make it through some of those transcripts of these discussions.

389
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:22,133
Scott: My personal advice is like, what should you do?

390
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:23,920
Rym: The listener, I would say, don't use TikTok.

391
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,846
Rym: Anyway, TikTok is bad for you, right?

392
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:28,174
Scott: I would say I should.

393
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:30,100
Scott: you should not create a TikTok account.

394
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:33,837
Scott: You should not install TikTok apps on any device you own.

395
00:25:33,937 --> 00:25:36,385
Rym: I would consider I talk to be a malware app myself.

396
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:54,605
Scott: If there is a TikTok creator who is chosen, who has chosen to use TikTok and their content is not available on any other channel, then do what I do, which would be to basically go in your normal old web browser, maybe private browsing mode or something, right?

397
00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:55,588
Scott: That block for sure.

398
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:57,434
Scott: It's always on, right?

399
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:03,596
Scott: Go directly to that person's TikTok channel, TikTok.com/at them and look at their content.

400
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,443
Scott: Don't go to any feeds or anything, right?

401
00:26:05,824 --> 00:26:08,031
Scott: Just go to them specifically, right?

402
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:10,660
Scott: And look at their TikToks and then that's it.

403
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:11,966
Scott: Don't go to any other.

404
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:12,548
Scott: Don't get.

405
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,625
Scott: start getting influenced by, you know, who knows what TikToks wants to show you automatically.

406
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:18,031
Rym: because remember propaganda.

407
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:25,124
Scott: So if there was a GeekNights' TikTok, which there isn't and probably won't be, you would just go to TikTok.com/@geeknights and that's it.

408
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:25,525
Rym: Yep.

409
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:29,260
Rym: But just remember propaganda is not as obvious as a lot of people think it is.

410
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,073
Rym: It's not like when you drive alone, you're riding with Hitler war posters.

411
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:43,108
Scott: But if you go to a specific creator TikTok.com/@somebody, it's not like on the GeekNights, you know, page that's suddenly going to be, China is great.

412
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,614
Scott: Things show up, right?

413
00:26:44,654 --> 00:26:47,243
Scott: It's not, that's not going to happen, right?

414
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:50,075
Scott: And if that did happen, well then, you know, just stop going there at all.

415
00:26:50,095 --> 00:27:07,900
Rym: But the type of propaganda that TikTok likely engages in and will engage in is consensus generation or the appearance of consensus around a particular topic or subtly nudging the narrative by choosing what gets featured and what doesn't get featured, which is that is how modern propaganda works.

416
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:15,506
Rym: Sometimes it's by accident, like even if YouTube is not being nefarious, their algorithms are just trying to get you to stay in YouTube.

417
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:19,123
Rym: And that might mean that's why certain things get promoted over other things.

418
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,691
Rym: It's a whole other topic for another show.

419
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:27,958
Rym: But yeah, the real moral is don't use TikTok because it's going to be a can of worms no matter how the situation goes.

420
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,863
Rym: And some other news.

421
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:38,545
Rym: So Nvidia, you might remember a while ago we couldn't buy any video cards because crypto bullshit.

422
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:43,682
Rym: guys were using video cards not to buy bitcoins, but to mine even shittier coins.

423
00:27:45,106 --> 00:27:49,797
Rym: So the CEO of Nvidia, I have this quote here.

424
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:51,661
Rym: No, the tech chief, not the CEO, the tech chief.

425
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:57,579
Rym: Well, Michael Kagan, the CTO was being interviewed and make some statements.

426
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,135
Rym: And he said, "Cryptocurrencies do not bring anything useful for society.

427
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:05,121
Rym: when asked about Nvidia's part of

428
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:05,562
Rym: crypto.".

429
00:28:06,706 --> 00:28:06,927
Rym: Good.

430
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:08,191
Rym: Which is fine.

431
00:28:08,392 --> 00:28:09,014
Rym: That's great.

432
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:10,078
Rym: We can buy video cards again.

433
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:12,102
Rym: That is correct.

434
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:13,266
Rym: And it's good to see.

435
00:28:13,787 --> 00:28:18,141
Rym: increasingly while we all know this is true, everyone knows this is true.

436
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:20,088
Rym: Even crypto people know this is true.

437
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:21,072
Rym: They're just scamming you.

438
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:37,537
Rym: But it is important for people who are in positions of power like this or positions of notice or notoriety to say it out loud because a lot of people don't believe things like that until there's a consensus of people who they trust or who they perceive as authorities saying it out loud.

439
00:28:37,617 --> 00:28:44,320
Rym: It is a moderately big deal that a big name person at a big company like this will say that out loud on purpose.

440
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:46,567
Scott: Very minor related story.

441
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:51,564
Scott: There was recently a case or many celebrities had promoted some NFT bullshit.

442
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:51,965
Scott: Oh yeah.

443
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:53,050
Rym: They're all getting sued now.

444
00:28:53,652 --> 00:28:53,833
Scott: Right.

445
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:55,360
Scott: I think they all lost or so.

446
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,623
Rym: They're all fucked.

447
00:28:56,643 --> 00:28:57,226
Rym: There's a whole...

448
00:28:57,306 --> 00:28:57,467
Scott: Right.

449
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:03,470
Scott: But basically they were paid to promote the NFTs, but they did not disclose that they were paid.

450
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:07,406
Scott: And people thought their promotion was a genuine promotion on an advertisement.

451
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:08,670
Scott: And that was illegal.

452
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:09,534
Scott: And they got in trouble.

453
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:11,421
Scott: So there you go.

454
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:14,553
Rym: There's also one of the big exchanges is getting sued by the SEC.

455
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:16,200
Rym: Crypto is in deep shit.

456
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:22,064
Rym: And I'm a personal strong believer in Bitcoin Zero, meaning they will be worth zero dollars while I am alive.

457
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:34,490
Rym: But the buried lead in this Nvidia story is that what you know, what's going to buy all the GPUs and make it hard for you to get video cards, these machine learning, generative models, AI machine learning.

458
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:39,169
Rym: That is where Nvidia is going to be focusing and has been focusing for a long time.

459
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:47,400
Rym: If you haven't been paying attention, video cards are the tip of the iceberg of what companies like this do and dedicated boards and chips for machine learning.

460
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,035
Rym: That's where a lot of the resources are going to be going for the next decade.

461
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:51,819
Rym: Yeah.

462
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,123
Scott: I mean, that is the real.

463
00:29:53,183 --> 00:29:56,773
Scott: you know, we wait since, you know, phones like 2007.

464
00:29:56,773 --> 00:30:01,790
Scott: We've been waiting for like the next technological thing to happen.

465
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:03,015
Rym: This is not great.

466
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,160
Rym: We're not saying I like this.

467
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,340
Rym: machine learning stuff is all like super useful or great right now, but it has some super great uses.

468
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:09,862
Scott: It does.

469
00:30:09,882 --> 00:30:11,650
Scott: But yeah, but it's for real.

470
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,571
Scott: It's like, you know, when people were hyping up crypto as like, oh, this is going to change everything.

471
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:17,214
Scott: It didn't change shit.

472
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:17,836
Scott: It was garbage.

473
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:19,182
Scott: This is the real deal.

474
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:20,528
Scott: This is what's going to be.

475
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:25,371
Scott: I almost feel like I actually have to go and learn it or something to make sure I keep my job or something.

476
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:31,118
Rym: We got a notification at work that we're not allowed to use external models for any work purposes, which is a prudent policy.

477
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:33,728
Scott: That's just common sense, at least for now.

478
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:36,980
Scott: But, you know, this is like, you know, I was looking at a deal.

479
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,070
Scott: This is going to be a thing probably for the rest of your life.

480
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:41,716
Scott: So, yeah,

481
00:30:42,017 --> 00:31:03,488
Rym: I guess what I'll say is don't evaluate what crypto, what crypto, we know what crypto was going to do, what this machine, the current machine learning stuff you're seeing, all the AI stuff you're seeing is doing right now, uh, because it's moving so fast, the actual science and the actual technology that nothing that has happened up to this point even matters compared to what's, what things are going to be like five years from now.

482
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,144
Rym: Like we're on a, we're on one of those little vertical Sigma curves.

483
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:15,039
Rym: Like anytime the rate of change is suddenly a straight line up, you're in a transitionary state, meaning nothing you do during that straight line matters at all.

484
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:16,082
Scott: Yeah.

485
00:31:16,162 --> 00:31:18,796
Scott: I mean, look at, you know, you look at like the original web, right?

486
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:19,981
Scott: And like the early nineties,

487
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:21,024
Rym: if you double down

488
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:35,539
Scott: on nothing like that whatsoever, we're still in that sort of phase of, you know, where we, like if machine learning is computers, we still have Commodore 64s and what we're actually going to end up with, you know, one thing stabilized, it looks nothing like

489
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:35,700
Rym: that.

490
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,142
Rym: Yup.

491
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,135
Rym: And, uh, we'll be talking about that only barely resembles it.

492
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:43,855
Rym: This is going to be a topic that's going to come up a lot in GeekNights for probably the rest of GeekNights.

493
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:48,448
Scott: Probably, or at least, you know, let's say 10, 15 years.

494
00:31:49,851 --> 00:32:00,323
Rym: So the other big news, and this one is we can't cover everything that's going on here, but if you're not aware, the internet archive basically lost their court case.

495
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,691
Scott: that's been going on for a while.

496
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:03,875
Rym: Huge court case.

497
00:32:04,316 --> 00:32:10,842
Rym: And much like what we talked about with Tik TOK, there's a lot of complexity and nuance and none of this is black and white.

498
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:12,851
Scott: It's pretty straightforward, right?

499
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:18,996
Rym: But I mean, in terms of what should be done and how should things like this be handled, what's the right way to handle this?

500
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:20,885
Rym: Not why did the lawsuit go the way it did?

501
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,780
Rym: Wait, usually I'm the one who's like, well, the lawsuit blah.

502
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,409
Scott: So here's what happened, right?

503
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:27,716
Scott: People weren't paying attention, right?

504
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:34,323
Scott: The internet archive is a great organization that, you know, is we're going to talk about it in the main bit, probably, definitely.

505
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:50,280
Scott: And it serves a very important purpose in that they're pretty much the only organization that is taking on a very large effort of archiving just lots and lots of things that, you know, regular old libraries, right, used to be their job, you know, are not getting done.

506
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,589
Scott: Mostly the internet, digital things.

507
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,080
Rym: I mean, think, imagine the internet 10 years ago.

508
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:59,820
Rym: It's so different from the internet today that it's unrecognizable and half of it's gone.

509
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:00,862
Scott: Yep.

510
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:07,953
Scott: And it's like the internet archive is keeping a lot of things available and alive that would otherwise not be available or alive.

511
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:26,266
Scott: And they've moved beyond just, you know, web pages with their way back machine, but also, you know, books, movies, literally anything that they can get and archive and store, you know, and they, you know, they still have a super long way to go, but it's like, they're still, they're already way ahead of basically everything, right?

512
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:30,162
Rym: And they are the modern library of Alexandria and they're doing good work.

513
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:31,006
Scott: Yes.

514
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:39,035
Scott: It's a very important organization, but the people running that organization had a problem, which the problem was called hubris.

515
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:40,820
Scott: hubris was the problem.

516
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:51,980
Scott: And what they did is they, they came up with this legal idea, at least in the U S and they, there was a group of people that supported this idea and they signed on to that group.

517
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,084
Scott: And their idea was this.

518
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,738
Scott: If we get physical copies of books, right?

519
00:33:56,778 --> 00:34:04,468
Scott: Let's say they get a physical copy of the book club book, uh, the satanic versus a book that is still under copyright in the U S cause it's not that old, right?

520
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:05,632
Scott: At least not old enough yet.

521
00:34:06,415 --> 00:34:12,239
Scott: And they say, well, we have a physical copy of the book on hand in our library, in our vault, right?

522
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,074
Scott: We scan in the book to create an ebook version, right?

523
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:16,996
Scott: To preserve the book.

524
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:18,282
Scott: That's, that's totally fine.

525
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:20,128
Scott: At least legally and morally for sure.

526
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:31,900
Scott: Um, then because we have one physical copy of the book, we think that we are allowed to lend out the ebook to one person at a time.

527
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:39,402
Scott: If we can ensure that only one person has, you know, the ebook, the, the ebook copy, right?

528
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:41,568
Scott: Our ebook copy of this book.

529
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:44,777
Scott: And we have one physical copy that that is legal.

530
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:48,672
Scott: Now that is a questionable legal thing with our capital Q.

531
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:58,490
Rym: think about how many, remember that little text you see in a lot of books that says something like this work can't be transferred, reproduced, modified, whatever, questionable.

532
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:05,014
Scott: There's a questionable legal theory that to my knowledge has not been tested in court and to my guests would lose in court.

533
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:11,616
Scott: But regardless, they had that theory and they, they empty develop that system and employed that system.

534
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:17,216
Scott: And obviously book publishers, the big ones in the U S we're not happy about that at all, right?

535
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:24,296
Scott: They want you to buy your ebook from the Kindle store and, or from a bookstore and give them money.

536
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:24,677
Scott: Right.

537
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:25,499
Scott: Okay.

538
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,449
Scott: So fast forward to the COVID times, right?

539
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:35,790
Scott: And they get even more hubris at the internet archive and they say national library book emergency.

540
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,754
Scott: I forget what they called it.

541
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:37,377
Scott: Something like that.

542
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:38,040
Scott: Right.

543
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:40,507
Scott: And they removed their restriction.

544
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:41,751
Scott: Right.

545
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:48,454
Scott: And they said, you know, you could just, well, you borrow as many copies, even more, more people can have the book out.

546
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:53,471
Scott: Then we have physical, that is all caps, questionable from a theory.

547
00:35:53,512 --> 00:35:55,719
Scott: They had a theory that if we do this, it's okay.

548
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:57,386
Scott: And then they just stopped doing that.

549
00:35:57,988 --> 00:36:03,027
Scott: right now, unlike say crunchy roll, which started out as a company of piracy that then went legit.

550
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:06,219
Scott: The internet archive has no way to do that.

551
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,162
Scott: It's not a business.

552
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:08,044
Scott: Right.

553
00:36:08,787 --> 00:36:11,294
Scott: Um, and so it's like, okay.

554
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:16,794
Scott: You know, I agree that like, this is actually personally, I think that's an okay, morally okay thing to do.

555
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:17,356
Scott: Right.

556
00:36:17,456 --> 00:36:26,964
Scott: I would like to see it work, but I can't deny that like legally, even someone who is not a lawyer can clearly see that that is just piracy.

557
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:27,667
Scott: Right.

558
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:29,975
Scott: That's clearly just piracy that would get you.

559
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,882
Scott: And you're not hiding the piracy.

560
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:36,600
Scott: Like most people do big time piracy, the kind that will actually get a lawsuit on you.

561
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:40,915
Scott: And they got the lawsuit on them and they lost the lawsuit.

562
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:41,417
Scott: Right.

563
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:51,208
Scott: So from here on, they can either stay losing, in which case there will be some sort of penalty or they can appeal, which I'm going to guess they would lose again.

564
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:56,007
Scott: Um, you know, they might not, I don't see any right, like way to appeal.

565
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,877
Rym: Like I don't see there's no like obvious errors.

566
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:05,602
Scott: So the problem here is that like, you know, I'm on their side from the sake of, I think that they're morally right.

567
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:11,344
Scott: And I want their important work to go on for them to continue to exist because they're important organizations in a capital.

568
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:19,284
Scott: They did an illegal, most likely, or at least so far, clearly illegal thing.

569
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:26,248
Scott: And if the punishment is too steep in terms of like, it'll probably be like some financial penalty to them, right.

570
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:32,029
Scott: For losing the case, let to pay the book publishers X dollars and damages, it might ruin them.

571
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,032
Scott: And that's bad.

572
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:34,155
Scott: I don't want them to be ruined.

573
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:34,697
Scott: Right.

574
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:39,770
Scott: Um, so it's just a sad, a sad tale of hubris.

575
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,195
Scott: I don't know where it's going to go.

576
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:47,200
Scott: Um, there's some people who are like, you know, mad, you know, who like really love the internet archive and are mad.

577
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:56,735
Scott: that like, you know, Hey, you know, bad book publishers and it's like, yeah, the book publishers are evil and whatnot, but the law is on their side.

578
00:37:56,755 --> 00:38:03,842
Rym: Well, also we're in a situation where the book publishers are to a degree looking out for the authors so they can be paid to be authors at all.

579
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:04,786
Scott: Yeah.

580
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:05,469
Scott: To some degree.

581
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:05,831
Scott: Right.

582
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:07,639
Scott: But it's like, you could just go to the regular law.

583
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:15,307
Scott: I mean, how many people really were using this to, it's like, that's the real question is like, did you know if, you know, legally, yes.

584
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:15,848
Scott: Right.

585
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:24,823
Scott: But how much damage was really done to authors by if the, even if the internet archive kept all this lending going on, unlimitedly, in my opinion, probably none.

586
00:38:25,204 --> 00:38:25,425
Scott: Right.

587
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:26,269
Scott: No one's using it.

588
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,518
Scott: Who's using the archive to check out books, right.

589
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:30,930
Scott: People who are going to pirate the book themselves from somewhere else.

590
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:31,192
Scott: Right.

591
00:38:31,212 --> 00:38:31,855
Scott: They were never going to.

592
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:51,237
Scott: so, um, yeah, it's just a sad tale of how, you know, the, the people running an organization's hubris can ruin their otherwise important, but also points out a fracture in that the concept of libraries was invented in an era before modern capitalism and digital works.

593
00:38:51,718 --> 00:38:55,384
Rym: And we haven't really figured out how to handle that as a society.

594
00:38:55,624 --> 00:39:09,206
Scott: There's a lot of places in the U S their meetings of the day.

595
00:39:09,226 --> 00:39:18,798
Rym: It's just a short little three minute 47 second video, uh, about the evolution of the cantile, which is a Finnish harp, and it is very well done.

596
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:37,360
Rym: It's just the same person playing this instrument and they're playing examples of the instrument from various stages in history, but they're also performing the kinds of music that people are performing on this instrument in those periods of history and they're updating their costumes along the way.

597
00:39:37,821 --> 00:39:42,917
Rym: This is a extremely entertaining video and I highly recommend everyone watch it.

598
00:39:43,098 --> 00:39:47,378
Scott: I commend the great deal of research that clearly must've gone into the making of this video.

599
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:48,563
Rym: Oh, this video is great.

600
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:49,226
Scott: Yeah.

601
00:39:49,507 --> 00:39:50,671
Rym: I subscribe to the channel too.

602
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:52,398
Scott: This video from the listener.

603
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:58,204
Scott: Thank you, listener for pointing out this great video in our forum that the other listener could join if they wanted to.

604
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:08,698
Scott: Uh, basically this is just some YouTube guy goes and interviews the COO, or at least the regional COO of an internet service provider in Connecticut.

605
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:17,776
Scott: And now this is interesting because we recently, not that recently, there was a thing of the day that was a ISP that was like one guy setting it up in his rural area somewhere.

606
00:40:17,896 --> 00:40:18,197
Scott: Right.

607
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:18,800
Rym: That was a good one.

608
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,481
Scott: Yeah.

609
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,352
Scott: This is like a medium sized ISP, right?

610
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:25,263
Scott: It's not like, you know, your Verizon's and your, you know, your.

611
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:28,738
Scott: whatever is your, your call, you know, Comcast or the big ones.

612
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:32,412
Scott: It's like this medium kind where it's like they big, right?

613
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:39,019
Scott: They got trucks and all kinds of equipment and warehouses and customer, and it got everything, but they're just not some massive telco.

614
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,067
Scott: They're like this medium size in between place.

615
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:47,609
Scott: Um, and what's really interesting to me about this video is a, they show you everything, right?

616
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:48,712
Scott: They're not hiding anything.

617
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:57,881
Scott: Uh, B they do a lot of bragging about how, yeah, we're not the evil, you know, cable guy like the other, like our competitors, right?

618
00:40:58,483 --> 00:40:59,507
Scott: You know, we help you out.

619
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:00,069
Scott: We're good.

620
00:41:00,189 --> 00:41:01,053
Scott: We're on your side.

621
00:41:01,073 --> 00:41:03,422
Scott: Uh, C. I looked at their website.

622
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:09,083
Scott: Their pricing is actually, if this ISP was in my area, I would switch to it from Fios just based on this alone.

623
00:41:09,644 --> 00:41:13,915
Scott: They're charging 50 bucks for like 300 megabit.

624
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:17,564
Scott: Um, that's less than Fios for the same, right?

625
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:18,125
Scott: Same deal.

626
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:28,093
Scott: So, uh, but yet it basically this, the regional COO shows YouTube guy like all their technology and how it works.

627
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,300
Scott: And it's pretty easy to understand.

628
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,151
Scott: if you know how your home network works, you can understand how this works.

629
00:41:33,955 --> 00:41:35,260
Scott: Um, only this fiber.

630
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:39,354
Scott: It's really awesome to see the equipment and see their warehouse and all that biz.

631
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:53,669
Scott: Um, and it looks like the fact that the regional CEO understands the technology gives you a lot of confidence in the company as a good sign, right?

632
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:59,352
Scott: The only thing that doesn't give me confidence in this company, which is called go net speed, is that I looked them up.

633
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:07,856
Scott: They used to be a publicly traded company, but some years ago they were acquired by private equity.

634
00:42:08,216 --> 00:42:14,539
Scott: And what's also interesting is that I looked at the border of their coverage and obviously they don't cover here, right?

635
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:20,879
Scott: But they cover literally people one block away from my mom's house, but not my mom's house.

636
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:29,150
Scott: And I'm like, I'm like, if they just move their coverage like one block over, I could get my mom to switch and she would get better internet and save money and all.

637
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:35,655
Scott: It's like, um, but it's still fascinating to see, you know, what's really going down at the ISP.

638
00:42:35,695 --> 00:42:37,322
Scott: What is their fiber optic shit like?

639
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:38,046
Scott: This is exactly here.

640
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:39,191
Scott: We'll show you the whole thing.

641
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:39,855
Scott: Yeah.

642
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:41,563
Rym: It's pretty straightforward up to a point.

643
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:42,367
Scott: Yeah.

644
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:44,216
Scott: It's straightforward up to the whole point.

645
00:42:44,236 --> 00:42:53,540
Rym: When you look at this, you get, yeah, well, I guess they, the commercial arrangements for the upstream, like that stuff gets complicated, but that stuff was not, yeah, that was not pictured.

646
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:59,738
Scott: They showed basically everything between the customer and the ISP itself.

647
00:42:59,798 --> 00:43:04,014
Rym: They didn't show beyond, but also that upstream is more business problem than technology problem.

648
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:04,717
Scott: Yeah.

649
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:06,403
Scott: But this is big enough.

650
00:43:06,423 --> 00:43:07,367
Scott: They got a handle on it.

651
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:07,568
Rym: Yeah.

652
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,423
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights book club book is ongoing.

653
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:14,608
Rym: The satanic versus today.

654
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,595
Scott: Today I went to the library, right?

655
00:43:18,517 --> 00:43:23,211
Scott: Uh, and I told them I wanted that book and dual purposes.

656
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:27,767
Scott: They have currently at the Queens, not the New York public libraries are weird in New York city.

657
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:32,106
Scott: There's there's a Brooklyn library, a Queens library, Bronx library, right?

658
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:37,065
Scott: And there's New York public library, but they're all sort of the same, but they're all not the same.

659
00:43:37,085 --> 00:43:37,607
Scott: Yeah.

660
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:46,195
Scott: But the Queens public library right now, if you go and get a library card, they got a special Mets, mr and mrs met library card.

661
00:43:46,215 --> 00:43:46,898
Rym: That's pretty good.

662
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:54,893
Scott: So I went there and cause I, you know, I've had a digital library card from there when I tried to get a physical one way back in the day and I just failed somehow.

663
00:43:54,954 --> 00:44:07,533
Scott: I think, all right, I had, I just moved here and my driver's license did not yet say that the New York city address and I didn't have a utility bill with my address on it.

664
00:44:08,055 --> 00:44:08,696
Scott: cause it, you're right.

665
00:44:08,797 --> 00:44:11,747
Scott: But, um, now my driver's license has my address on it.

666
00:44:11,788 --> 00:44:18,416
Scott: So I was able to get the physical library card and I told them, get me, this is a Titanic versus book, so I don't have to buy it from Amazon.

667
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:21,266
Scott: And they said, okay, we'll email you when it's here.

668
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:24,756
Scott: Cause the library nearby is very small.

669
00:44:25,137 --> 00:44:25,920
Scott: It's like two rooms.

670
00:44:26,461 --> 00:44:27,345
Scott: Um, yep.

671
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:30,699
Rym: It's, it's, it's, it's a big book and there's a lot of allegorical densities.

672
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:42,665
Scott: So I think it'll take a little while for us to finish it, but if you're starting, I think the library will be excellent choice because a not paying money, uh, but also B I got to finish it before I got to give it back.

673
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:45,132
Scott: That'll help us help things along here.

674
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:46,275
Rym: Not a bad strategy.

675
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,017
Scott: Yeah.

676
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:57,673
Rym: Uh, also we were live at PAX East 2023, uh, likely the last mask packs or last mask convention I'm expecting can competitive and casual coexist.

677
00:44:57,693 --> 00:44:59,480
Rym: We did the panel, we hung around the con.

678
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:13,805
Rym: We tried out a bunch of new tech that Scott bought and way, I think hopefully with PAX West and especially PAX Unplugged, we can get back to earlier era of GeekNights, convention content and coverage and stuff.

679
00:45:13,986 --> 00:45:21,036
Scott: So maybe we could go make use of the, you know, in the summertime, once we finished the stupid website, we could go outside and use it.

680
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,867
Rym: Maybe we'll go do class outside recording GeekNights outside.

681
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:30,627
Rym: We could, we did some tests before with some earlier tech and uh, I think now is the time.

682
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,171
Rym: Last time was not quite the time.

683
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:35,480
Rym: So, uh, yeah, stay tuned for that.

684
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:40,160
Rym: I don't think, I think our next convention for GeekNights is probably going to be PAX West.

685
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,950
Rym: Uh, maybe I'm thinking about going to Connecticut.

686
00:45:43,011 --> 00:45:45,383
Rym: We'll see what the situation is through a few panels there.

687
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,131
Rym: That's a very easy trip.

688
00:45:47,714 --> 00:45:48,860
Rym: You don't have to come if you don't want to.

689
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,258
Scott: Maybe it's really, it's really, it's really about how convenient it is, right?

690
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:55,459
Rym: Yeah.

691
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:56,581
Rym: We'll see.

692
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:57,344
Rym: I'm thinking about it.

693
00:45:57,605 --> 00:45:58,528
Rym: Uh, I was gonna go.

694
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:06,702
Rym: So the year COVID started, I was actually planning to go back to Connecticut because now we'd resigned as like senior staff and just do some panels.

695
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:13,291
Rym: And for the first time, just experienced that con as a regular ass attendee who did some panels and not like having to run everything.

696
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:14,518
Rym: And then COVID happened.

697
00:46:14,558 --> 00:46:16,185
Rym: And obviously haven't been to Connecticut since.

698
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:18,755
Rym: So I don't want to go back.

699
00:46:18,795 --> 00:46:25,201
Rym: I got, I looked at a picture of that convention center and it hit me right in the nostalgia, just right there in the nostalgia bean.

700
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:31,100
Rym: So archiving the internet, uh, you know, we just talked about this in the main bit.

701
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,829
Rym: Uh, I mean, it's obvious how important this is.

702
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:41,047
Rym: The internet is one of the newest and most transformational things humans have invented.

703
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,056
Rym: Like it is a brand new kind of thing.

704
00:46:44,076 --> 00:46:59,807
Rym: Uh, arguably if you add the best argument that you can make in terms of trying to expand the history and say, it's not that new is that it is the logical extension of the Telegraph, which was absolutely earth shattering and how it changed the world.

705
00:46:59,827 --> 00:47:00,730
Rym: Yep.

706
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:13,356
Rym: And the fact that regular old people like us can put stuff on the internet, even from some of its earliest days, when it was opened up to public, all the things that happen, humans are making so much content.

707
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:24,777
Rym: There is so much that is created and lost on the internet on like a weekly basis at this point that preserving even a fraction of it is going to be extremely important for the future of humanity.

708
00:47:24,797 --> 00:47:26,583
Rym: And you think, well, how important could it be?

709
00:47:27,406 --> 00:47:31,140
Rym: Think about how hard it is to research what happened a hundred years ago.

710
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,844
Rym: Now, when there were

711
00:47:32,864 --> 00:47:52,349
Scott: books, we could end up in a situation where a hundred years from now, you know, historians know more about the 20th century than they know about the 21st century, because so much of what happened in the 21st century would not be stored and saved in any recorded form that they could still access.

712
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:52,810
Scott: Right.

713
00:47:52,830 --> 00:48:05,178
Scott: But the century is on papers that have been, you know, locked away somewhere, or at least on, you know, some sort of physical distance, you know, something that is saved that someone can still access and read and look at.

714
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:05,680
Rym: Yep.

715
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:13,411
Rym: But also there were a lot of, like, if you look at old, even ancient history, you'll see that we see history of a relatively stable period.

716
00:48:13,853 --> 00:48:23,284
Rym: And then suddenly like the potter is different and suddenly like a bunch of shit is different in the historical record, but usually data from the transition is lost.

717
00:48:23,785 --> 00:48:37,229
Rym: So if the internet, which has been changing and evolving exponentially for as long as I have been alive, you know, since 1982, the internet's been changing like every year is radically different than the previous year.

718
00:48:37,732 --> 00:48:44,100
Rym: If that is such a transitionary period, then that is an extremely important period that is being lost in real time.

719
00:48:45,241 --> 00:48:46,789
Scott: The way I think about it is this, right?

720
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:49,099
Scott: Like, you know, back, think about history, right?

721
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,209
Scott: Well, there was a Bronze Age at some point, right?

722
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:55,650
Scott: And they made shit largely out of bronze, or at least somewhat out of bronze, right?

723
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,320
Scott: That's why it was called the Bronze Age.

724
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,560
Rym: You know, I just read a very long essay about urbanization and the early Bronze Age.

725
00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:05,553
Scott: The point is in the Bronze Age, they learned how to bronze, right?

726
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:09,789
Scott: And they had bronze items and those bronze items have survived to the present day.

727
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:14,446
Scott: And therefore we know something about the people of the Bronze Age, right?

728
00:49:14,847 --> 00:49:16,192
Scott: We know information about them.

729
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:22,070
Scott: If at some point in history, there had been a wood age, right?

730
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:23,754
Scott: An age of only wood.

731
00:49:24,736 --> 00:49:30,476
Scott: Only thing we would know about the wood age would be from the bones of the dead people of the wood age, right?

732
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:38,166
Scott: Because all of their writings in wood, their houses made of wood, their everything made of wood would no longer be around, right?

733
00:49:38,206 --> 00:49:45,693
Scott: Well, case in point, there could have been a wood age, for all we know, probably even, and the people of the wood are lost.

734
00:49:45,894 --> 00:49:58,200
Rym: There's a lot of more recent cultures, like Babylon and Samaria, where we have a lot of writing from those eras, but we only have, like, the boring bookkeeping, like the stuff that people archive for business reasons and political reasons.

735
00:49:58,601 --> 00:50:03,057
Rym: But what we didn't have is the writings of regular old people in everyday life.

736
00:50:03,258 --> 00:50:05,846
Rym: We have all the receipts, but we don't have any of the novels.

737
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:07,230
Scott: Exactly.

738
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:13,872
Scott: So, if we continue to write things on the internet, like just some lousy GeekNights MP3s, right?

739
00:50:14,273 --> 00:50:16,983
Scott: Well, let's talk about GeekNights MP3s, right?

740
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:25,429
Scott: Right now we pay a company, right, Libsyn, to post them on hard drives to where people can access them publicly for free.

741
00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:46,157
Scott: We could put them on the internet archive, which would be illegal because Creative Commons, you know, I think some of them are there, and they will preserve them, and there are many other people we could pay or not pay to store these MP3s on their hard drives, their storage devices, and maybe or maybe not serve them up.

742
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:50,731
Scott: We also have local copies on hard drives that we own personally, right?

743
00:50:51,372 --> 00:50:58,095
Scott: So, if we were to pass from this world, which will happen someday, all right, what will happen to those MP3s?

744
00:50:58,536 --> 00:51:13,488
Rym: Best case scenario, like the best possible case for those MP3s, is that somehow we have made enough money, and the world is in a situation to where we would be comfortable spending that money on what I'm about to describe instead of other causes.

745
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:18,409
Rym: We build a trust with the intent of trying to keep that data around as long as possible.

746
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:24,551
Scott: And the people at that trust actually have to do the work that our dead selves can't hold them accountable for, right?

747
00:51:25,553 --> 00:51:32,318
Rym: They got like a bust of Scott in a data center, and they're like, "Yeah, this data center is to keep that guy's mouthing

748
00:51:32,439 --> 00:51:32,800
Rym: alive.".

749
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:50,059
Scott: Even if we find some young lawyer, some lawyer straight out of law school in their 20s who really believes in this kind of work, and that ends up being their legal specialty of like preserving things, you know, running trusts and preserving things and whatever, and there's a board of trustees and all that stuff, and we put it all together, and it's well funded, right?

750
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:54,712
Scott: The board of trustees will pass from this world, right?

751
00:51:55,033 --> 00:52:00,231
Scott: How long will they keep that going, the trust that preserves the Geek Dice MP3s, right?

752
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:03,020
Scott: Through all the tumult of the world, right?

753
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:14,502
Scott: It's like, you know, we see already the archive.org, the internet archive, is not invulnerable, you know, the Libsyn bill has to keep getting paid, that company won't last forever, right?

754
00:52:14,743 --> 00:52:17,210
Scott: Are podcasts always going to be a thing, right?

755
00:52:18,294 --> 00:52:19,918
Rym: I have hard drives here, don't stop work.

756
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:31,540
Scott: It's like, I have hard drives here, they'll stop working eventually, you know, even if someone inherits them, are they going to try, you know, take care of this NAS and preserve this data?

757
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,778
Scott: And it's like, how dedicated will they be to that if just two of the drives crash?

758
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:37,022
Scott: That's that, the end, right?

759
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:39,229
Scott: They can't, they had to be on top of that.

760
00:52:39,711 --> 00:52:43,884
Scott: And then someone else has to be on top of that after them, right?

761
00:52:43,904 --> 00:52:52,633
Rym: I think we put it all on long-term like worm memory, or we put it on the kind of stuff that you put like regulated data on.

762
00:52:53,155 --> 00:53:09,033
Rym: One, it's a lot of data because it's audio compressed or whatever, but even those formats degrade and they're almost worse in some ways because one of the truest things to know about digital data is that the data that gets preserved is the data that is accessed frequently.

763
00:53:09,294 --> 00:53:13,170
Rym: The less frequently it is accessed, the more likely it is that bit rot will happen.

764
00:53:13,411 --> 00:53:18,170
Rym: And before you say, well, bit rot is absolutely a thing and there's a lot of things that cause it.

765
00:53:18,893 --> 00:53:19,054
Scott: Yeah.

766
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:25,195
Scott: I mean, this is the principle behind the architecture of, you know, get the source control system, right?

767
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:33,906
Scott: Is that unlike previous source control systems, when you clone a Git repository, you are actually cloning the whole thing in most cases, right?

768
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:52,409
Scott: So like if someone has an open source project out there on the GitHub and I say, I want to do some work on that project and I do get clone, I now have an entire copy of that project and its entire code history now on my computer and every single person who ever worked on that project also has a copy.

769
00:53:52,751 --> 00:54:09,612
Scott: So it's like if it would take, in order for that to be lost, even if they delete the GitHub repository, anyone who's ever cared about that project enough to check out the code locally on their own computer could restore it fully or almost fully to the state ad it was in when they checked it out.

770
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:11,700
Rym: So a better way to keep GeekNights going.

771
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,284
Scott: Something is very popular.

772
00:54:13,304 --> 00:54:17,095
Scott: It is naturally backed up many, many times.

773
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:29,370
Rym: Which in a way is a nice self-reinforcing system wherein the things that the society collectively cares more about are preserved by more people via more means.

774
00:54:30,172 --> 00:54:30,352
Rym: Yep.

775
00:54:30,553 --> 00:54:45,727
Rym: But that also means that some data that people don't care that much about, because as you can imagine, what society in aggregate cares about doesn't always necessarily align with what a historian might care about or what a society maybe should care about.

776
00:54:46,169 --> 00:54:49,542
Rym: So already that doesn't necessarily mean the most important data is preserved.

777
00:54:50,003 --> 00:54:50,224
Scott: Right.

778
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:51,488
Scott: We think about like some memes.

779
00:54:51,568 --> 00:55:00,095
Scott: It's like, yeah, you know, the platforms come and go and people always will repost the old memes to the new platform.

780
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:03,506
Scott: If I look on TikTok, I bet I can find all your base on there somewhere.

781
00:55:03,687 --> 00:55:04,049
Scott: Yeah.

782
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:05,715
Scott: It's like it's protected.

783
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:09,509
Rym: But like a lot of those old flash guys at YouTube flash games.

784
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:16,254
Rym: All those old flash games, what a lot of people did is just play them, record themselves playing them and put them on YouTube.

785
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:18,382
Rym: And you can experience most of them that way.

786
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,610
Rym: Like that's also copy.

787
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,554
Rym: But that's a copy.

788
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:22,317
Scott: That's a separate.

789
00:55:22,337 --> 00:55:26,047
Scott: that's a separate issue of where the data has been preserved.

790
00:55:26,387 --> 00:55:32,102
Scott: But the technology to use the data is not been so well preserved.

791
00:55:32,122 --> 00:55:37,969
Scott: But there are people there's a lot of people making like flash, you know, alternatives and emulators and things of that nature.

792
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:39,254
Rym: And we're going to skip the whole.

793
00:55:39,274 --> 00:55:43,474
Rym: how do you preserve an ephemeral digital interactive space like an MMO?

794
00:55:43,494 --> 00:55:45,242
Rym: We've talked about that on Tuesday GeekNights before.

795
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:46,066
Rym: Yeah.

796
00:55:46,106 --> 00:55:47,833
Scott: I mean, it's very difficult question, right?

797
00:55:47,873 --> 00:55:51,651
Scott: It's like if the website changes a hundred times, you know, the wayback machine.

798
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:51,852
Scott: Yeah.

799
00:55:51,872 --> 00:55:53,821
Rym: What's the official version of my GeoCities site?

800
00:55:54,082 --> 00:55:58,400
Scott: The first one, the wayback machine just records many versions, snapshots over time.

801
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,871
Scott: And you can look at the same website at different points in its history.

802
00:56:02,032 --> 00:56:02,313
Rym: Yeah.

803
00:56:03,115 --> 00:56:06,708
Rym: But a lot of websites I made are just gone.

804
00:56:06,768 --> 00:56:07,792
Rym: I mean, I didn't back them up.

805
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:08,414
Rym: I was a kid.

806
00:56:08,455 --> 00:56:11,306
Rym: They were they wrote them in a notepad, like literally wrote.

807
00:56:11,386 --> 00:56:11,767
Scott: I did.

808
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:14,157
Scott: I have backed up pretty much everything in the 2000s.

809
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:18,391
Scott: But yeah, there's some stuff in the 90s that I didn't back up.

810
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,177
Scott: And it's it's gone.

811
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:20,900
Rym: Yep.

812
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,050
Rym: I've been looking for like some of my old stuff.

813
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,418
Rym: And yeah, none of that is out there.

814
00:56:26,438 --> 00:56:27,744
Scott: I looked on the floppy disk.

815
00:56:27,844 --> 00:56:30,579
Scott: I can't look any further back than the three and a half inch floppies.

816
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:31,423
Scott: And that's it.

817
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:47,756
Rym: Searching the Internet and searching other archives for, of all things, the ICQ numbers I used has been an interesting way to actually find more data than I expected about me, because that is a primary key that was unique to me.

818
00:56:48,057 --> 00:56:51,570
Rym: That is a string of numbers, a few strings of numbers, actually, that made it around the Internet.

819
00:56:51,932 --> 00:57:00,708
Rym: But even then, pretty much everything I found was either a dead link or someone had just taken that data and put it in a profile about me on a site I never use.

820
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:08,135
Rym: Like the new Oticon forum has my ICQ in it because they imported my account, despite the fact that I was banned from the old account.

821
00:57:08,678 --> 00:57:09,220
Rym: I can't log in.

822
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:09,862
Rym: It says I'm banned.

823
00:57:09,922 --> 00:57:18,993
Scott: But but like, you know, my Geocities page is like I had one, but it was not, I guess, significant enough to be preserved by whoever did some work.

824
00:57:19,234 --> 00:57:20,238
Rym: Oh, even worse.

825
00:57:20,298 --> 00:57:21,925
Rym: I had one that was the one people knew about.

826
00:57:22,266 --> 00:57:27,104
Rym: Then I had a network of like 20 of them that I had made because each one gave me two megabytes.

827
00:57:27,385 --> 00:57:32,841
Rym: And I used that to run an NES ROM site that was active for some time.

828
00:57:32,901 --> 00:57:37,218
Rym: But that is a case where I was studiously trying to make sure nobody knew about it.

829
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:38,443
Rym: Nobody preserved it.

830
00:57:38,744 --> 00:57:40,692
Rym: It was like a do you know about it or not?

831
00:57:40,732 --> 00:57:41,315
Rym: situation.

832
00:57:41,455 --> 00:57:45,890
Rym: I like made sure there was no way to tie it back to me whatsoever under any circumstances.

833
00:57:46,252 --> 00:57:52,279
Rym: So that's almost impossible to archive if the person making it actively does not want people to keep it around.

834
00:57:53,481 --> 00:57:57,921
Scott: Another difficult thing is that, you know, you talked about the telegram at the beginning, right?

835
00:57:58,082 --> 00:58:00,169
Scott: It's like, are all telegrams preserved?

836
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:04,245
Scott: No, it's like there was a lot of direct human to human communication.

837
00:58:04,305 --> 00:58:06,940
Scott: Phone calls are preserved unless they're like the president's phone.

838
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:18,593
Rym: But imagine if a historian today could read every telegram sent and received from like the British government telegram office in eighteen forty.

839
00:58:19,174 --> 00:58:19,455
Scott: Right.

840
00:58:19,957 --> 00:58:25,055
Scott: So on the one hand, it's like at the you know, for direct communications between people.

841
00:58:25,477 --> 00:58:25,698
Scott: Right.

842
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:29,951
Scott: There is a need for secrecy, privacy, etc.

843
00:58:30,312 --> 00:58:31,416
Scott: in the immediate moment.

844
00:58:31,476 --> 00:58:31,696
Scott: Right.

845
00:58:31,737 --> 00:58:32,880
Scott: Snapchats that disappear.

846
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:33,561
Scott: Right.

847
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:35,388
Scott: Instagram stories.

848
00:58:35,408 --> 00:58:42,574
Rym: But in the long, long term, long after everyone involved or could ever be harmed or influenced or annoyed by that conversation is long dead.

849
00:58:43,156 --> 00:58:49,860
Rym: Think about how many of the things you read in school are the private letters between Thomas Jefferson and some guy.

850
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:50,862
Scott: Right.

851
00:58:50,923 --> 00:58:54,660
Scott: It's like, you know, those were on paper, so they got saved somehow.

852
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:58,011
Scott: They looked in someone's desk after they died and they took them all.

853
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:05,662
Scott: But it's like, yeah, those that even your inconsequential stuff like, you know, hey, when are you picking me up from the pizza place?

854
00:59:05,963 --> 00:59:06,284
Scott: Right.

855
00:59:06,424 --> 00:59:13,305
Scott: It's like that still once your life, you know, is that information need to be known to everyone now?

856
00:59:13,646 --> 00:59:14,329
Scott: Is it a value?

857
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:15,473
Scott: Does anyone get to preserve that?

858
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:15,795
Scott: No.

859
00:59:16,237 --> 00:59:21,417
Scott: But in a long time from now, it's like, ah, there was this thing called pizza back then.

860
00:59:21,497 --> 00:59:22,722
Scott: People had to be picked up.

861
00:59:22,782 --> 00:59:24,770
Scott: There's so much information.

862
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:27,480
Rym: We think it was used for ritualistic purposes.

863
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,862
Scott: Yeah, sure.

864
00:59:29,544 --> 00:59:31,331
Scott: It was like, you know, it was.

865
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:37,037
Scott: there's so much information, even in just that, you know, and if you could see, ah, there was lots of communications of this nature.

866
00:59:37,057 --> 00:59:37,358
Scott: Right.

867
00:59:37,379 --> 00:59:37,600
Scott: We can.

868
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,288
Scott: they could gauge how popular different things were.

869
00:59:40,348 --> 00:59:45,523
Scott: It's such incredible value in worthless, worthless data.

870
00:59:45,543 --> 00:59:49,516
Rym: I could go take names of food and drink from less than 100 years ago.

871
00:59:49,556 --> 00:59:54,052
Rym: And if I tell you about them, you will have no idea what the fuck they are.

872
00:59:54,072 --> 00:59:54,996
Rym: Yeah.

873
00:59:55,016 --> 00:59:57,125
Scott: Historical food channels on YouTube are a big hit.

874
00:59:57,326 --> 00:59:57,587
Scott: Yeah.

875
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:58,209
Scott: Guess what?

876
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:01,062
Scott: The food you eat now will be historical food in a long time.

877
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:01,222
Scott: Yeah.

878
01:00:01,524 --> 01:00:04,757
Rym: Ask an aristocrat in America in the 17 hundreds what punch is.

879
01:00:04,877 --> 01:00:06,522
Rym: And it's not what you think punch is.

880
01:00:09,128 --> 01:00:10,230
Rym: Also, it is vile.

881
01:00:10,531 --> 01:00:12,996
Rym: It is the vilest alcoholic garbage.

882
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:13,758
Rym: Good Lord.

883
01:00:14,139 --> 01:00:23,251
Rym: Whatever opinion you have of the American founding fathers will be lessened further than it was already lessened by, you know, slavery and how America turned out.

884
01:00:23,592 --> 01:00:25,540
Rym: If you read what they liked to drink.

885
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:26,421
Scott: All right.

886
01:00:26,441 --> 01:00:28,414
Scott: So even if we agree, we want to preserve everything.

887
01:00:28,494 --> 01:00:28,695
Scott: Right.

888
01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:29,962
Scott: So here is the problems.

889
01:00:30,062 --> 01:00:30,303
Scott: Right.

890
01:00:30,323 --> 01:00:32,372
Scott: So problem number one is the technological problem.

891
01:00:32,412 --> 01:00:42,687
Scott: And basically, if you just if you could somehow magically write, you know, get all the data on the whole Internet all at once, where can you fit it?

892
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:46,720
Scott: It's like it's stored already on the hard drives and storage devices.

893
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:51,160
Rym: You made a copy of the Internet that is obsolete before you finish making the copy.

894
01:00:51,701 --> 01:00:52,343
Scott: Well, forget that.

895
01:00:52,383 --> 01:00:55,714
Scott: But we don't have enough storage devices to just have two of it.

896
01:00:56,918 --> 01:01:05,430
Scott: Where are you going to put this other this one place where it has enough hard drives to hold the whole Internet versus the whole the rest of the Earth?

897
01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:12,897
Rym: It's like now one could argue that even if you have it and even if we only look at one snapshot of it, like say the U.S.

898
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:20,176
Rym: Census every 10 years, they take a snapshot of the Internet and they store it and they somehow solve that problem, which is already like we're already at an unsolvable problem.

899
01:01:20,216 --> 01:01:23,891
Scott: So everything we're talking beyond this isn't enough storage to hold the whole Internet.

900
01:01:24,052 --> 01:01:24,895
Rym: But today we've got it.

901
01:01:25,537 --> 01:01:27,482
Rym: The fuck do you find anything in that?

902
01:01:27,763 --> 01:01:30,488
Rym: Like we can't search the actual Internet effectively anymore.

903
01:01:30,508 --> 01:01:31,790
Scott: No, we can't.

904
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:38,010
Rym: So now, luckily, I do think that is an area where machine learning is going to solve that problem.

905
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:43,260
Rym: Maybe data curation and like finding data in data.

906
01:01:43,942 --> 01:01:55,186
Rym: But data leaks are a concept that are very important because they're basically if I had to summarize it and not get into the tech of it, a data lake is when there's a there's information that's too much for you to process.

907
01:01:55,487 --> 01:01:58,201
Rym: But you know that data might be valuable to me someday.

908
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:03,923
Rym: Like I want to do something with that data, but I don't have the resources to heavily curate that data today.

909
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:12,150
Rym: You dump it all in a data lake, meaning in the future you might dive into that lake to pull data out to do something with it.

910
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:15,470
Rym: But you're just trying to keep as much of it around as possible for the time being.

911
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:17,379
Rym: But data lakes are not archives.

912
01:02:17,419 --> 01:02:21,036
Rym: Data lakes disappear shockingly quickly, if not heavily maintained.

913
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:23,688
Scott: Data lakes are mostly a corporate thing, right?

914
01:02:23,749 --> 01:02:29,498
Scott: It's like, you know, you don't you know, you have your database where everything is structured and there's a schema and it's right.

915
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:37,192
Scott: But the data lake is more like, OK, dump all the spreadsheets and all the PDFs and all the everything and dump all the logs from other servers there, because why not?

916
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:37,794
Scott: Right.

917
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:40,303
Scott: And we OK, it's not perfectly structured.

918
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:42,310
Scott: It's not ideal, right?

919
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:43,454
Scott: It's not the database.

920
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:48,650
Scott: But we do have technology that will allow us to search it to some extent, right?

921
01:02:48,912 --> 01:02:51,764
Scott: To look at it to some extent, to query it to some extent.

922
01:02:51,844 --> 01:02:52,527
Scott: It's not perfect.

923
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:56,787
Scott: It's not ideal, you know, as it would be if everything was organized perfectly.

924
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,093
Scott: But it still provides business value.

925
01:02:59,394 --> 01:02:59,615
Scott: Right.

926
01:02:59,896 --> 01:03:03,850
Scott: But you can't operate one of those on the scale of the whole Internet.

927
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:04,813
Scott: That's not going to work.

928
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:05,777
Rym: Let's say we could.

929
01:03:06,018 --> 01:03:07,464
Rym: Let's say we even solve that problem.

930
01:03:08,387 --> 01:03:22,530
Rym: The laws of every country, the way copyright works, the way capital, all that whole giant can of worms makes it extremely difficult to archive anything without being sued or at least blocked.

931
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:22,710
Scott: Right.

932
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:27,250
Scott: You try to scrape some website, they're going to block you because you're costing them money.

933
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:27,551
Rym: Yeah.

934
01:03:27,852 --> 01:03:36,630
Rym: I mean, if you get the data and maybe you avoid the public, like if you archive data, but you don't like republish it or do much with it, then you can definitely get away with it.

935
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:39,280
Rym: Like they can't sue you if they don't know you did it.

936
01:03:39,602 --> 01:03:44,642
Rym: But even then, if you're not sharing it, then bit rot sets in like you're not using that data.

937
01:03:44,702 --> 01:03:46,470
Rym: So no one can find that data when you die.

938
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,253
Rym: That data is gone.

939
01:03:47,855 --> 01:03:55,786
Scott: And if no one can find it, that's letting people have access to it is a way of backing it up because more people will have copies of it.

940
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:56,067
Scott: Right.

941
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:59,985
Scott: You know, if you make a website, you know, and then you have your personal backup.

942
01:04:00,266 --> 01:04:06,050
Scott: But it's like, well, there is some person out there who's weird and is taking screenshots to your website every day.

943
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:06,432
Scott: Yeah.

944
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:14,070
Scott: And there's some, you know, it's like, yeah, you know, I talked about all the backups of GeekNights that we make, but it's like there's a YouTube channel that we don't endorse that.

945
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,355
Rym: It's called just like Rym and Scott.

946
01:04:15,716 --> 01:04:24,430
Rym: And it just has the audio every fucking every single fucking GeekNights episode just in a YouTube video with a really blurry like photo of one of our logos.

947
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,054
Rym: Someone's making that.

948
01:04:26,616 --> 01:04:26,876
Scott: Yeah.

949
01:04:26,957 --> 01:04:27,940
Scott: It's probably some bot.

950
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:28,582
Scott: Yeah.

951
01:04:28,602 --> 01:04:31,171
Rym: But I don't care, but I don't care either.

952
01:04:31,191 --> 01:04:34,768
Scott: But, you know, some listener out there might just be saving all the MP threes.

953
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:35,170
Scott: Right.

954
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:36,775
Scott: That's one more place.

955
01:04:37,136 --> 01:04:38,601
Scott: So something's really popular.

956
01:04:38,983 --> 01:04:42,134
Scott: It's like, you know, some actual Hollywood movie.

957
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:42,856
Scott: Right.

958
01:04:43,057 --> 01:04:44,341
Scott: Is completely safe now.

959
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:44,723
Scott: Right.

960
01:04:44,783 --> 01:04:50,640
Scott: Has no worries about that because there are people with DVDs and boo rays.

961
01:04:50,681 --> 01:04:54,492
Rym: Imagine a show someone makes that only thousands of people watch.

962
01:04:54,532 --> 01:04:57,687
Rym: They upload it to YouTube and then they die and everyone forgets it.

963
01:04:57,728 --> 01:04:59,893
Rym: Like that's going to get lost so fast.

964
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,066
Scott: So, so what, what can, what can we do realistically?

965
01:05:06,086 --> 01:05:16,981
Rym: I think this is something that needs to be addressed by state level, like state level entities, like governments or the scale of how this kind of problem has to be solved.

966
01:05:17,362 --> 01:05:27,779
Rym: And I feel like data curation and preservation for historical purposes should be a primary duty of large governments, but we're a long way from that.

967
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:27,819
Rym: I

968
01:05:28,321 --> 01:05:38,965
Scott: don't know if it, you know, I don't know if it's something that like should be a duty of governments, but you know, for any other reason besides there's nothing else big enough to take on a test that, that, that arguably

969
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:43,391
Rym: that's the only reason to have a government, to handle the things that are too big for small groups of people to handle on their own.

970
01:05:43,892 --> 01:05:44,113
Scott: Yeah.

971
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:56,870
Scott: But I think really all the governments have to do is, you know, tax people, which they already do, but do it more, uh, and put the correct percentage of their budget into libraries.

972
01:05:57,651 --> 01:05:57,891
Rym: Yup.

973
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:00,880
Rym: Libraries, library of Alexandria.

974
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,324
Rym: That's how you preserve data.

975
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:06,760
Scott: And then the libraries have experts at doing exactly this.

976
01:06:06,841 --> 01:06:07,986
Rym: And what are the experts going to do?

977
01:06:08,267 --> 01:06:12,204
Rym: They're going to take all the questions we just raised and already have the correct answers.

978
01:06:12,285 --> 01:06:13,490
Scott: They already have the answers.

979
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:19,502
Scott: You go to library school, someone out there who already went to library school is like already has all the answers to everything we asked her in this show.

980
01:06:19,623 --> 01:06:21,853
Rym: Our friend Pat is trying to do this just for conventions.

981
01:06:22,074 --> 01:06:25,306
Rym: And I've learned a lot just talking to him because he studied this.

982
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:29,807
Rym: And uh, yeah, generally if you let experts solve these problems, they'll solve them.

983
01:06:29,848 --> 01:06:31,756
Rym: They might not be able to save everything, but you know what?

984
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:41,435
Rym: If they know we can only save 10% of the internet, they're going to do a much better job of figuring out what 10% than a government will or any random person or any tech company will.

985
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:46,793
Scott: And you know, really it's like saving anything at this point, right?

986
01:06:47,415 --> 01:06:51,046
Scott: So one thing I've seen so many things disappear already.

987
01:06:51,147 --> 01:06:57,108
Scott: Like there are things that I saw in my life that are, that no longer exist and can no longer be found.

988
01:06:57,148 --> 01:06:57,309
Scott: Right.

989
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:02,649
Scott: It's like, I don't think that happened a lot in, I think that happened before recorded history.

990
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:04,256
Scott: You lost everything in your whole life, right?

991
01:07:04,276 --> 01:07:12,187
Scott: There was no recording of anything, but I feel like, you know, in the 20th century, it's like things that existed didn't stop existing.

992
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:12,609
Scott: Right.

993
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:17,625
Scott: It's like, there's actually very few things from the earlier part of my life.

994
01:07:17,765 --> 01:07:20,314
Scott: Pre-internet are no longer around at all.

995
01:07:20,475 --> 01:07:20,636
Scott: Right.

996
01:07:20,656 --> 01:07:21,560
Scott: It's like, you can find them.

997
01:07:22,062 --> 01:07:30,196
Scott: It's a vintage shop or an antique shop or who knows what, but like memories and documentation of those things in the eighties nineties are all around.

998
01:07:30,437 --> 01:07:31,360
Scott: We, we, right.

999
01:07:31,962 --> 01:07:34,010
Scott: Um, it's things from the early two thousands.

1000
01:07:34,231 --> 01:07:34,472
Scott: Yeah.

1001
01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:37,061
Rym: There's a lot of photos of me up until high school.

1002
01:07:37,082 --> 01:07:45,512
Rym: And then there's not a lot of photos of me until good digital cameras and smart cameras appeared like things from when I was in college and sure.

1003
01:07:45,552 --> 01:07:58,959
Scott: And when we were in, I have like 30 total photos of us in college, like, yeah, it's like, well, things from those times are actually the hardest things for me to find record of, um, as terms of the period of my life.

1004
01:07:59,079 --> 01:07:59,219
Scott: Right.

1005
01:07:59,259 --> 01:08:08,991
Scott: When I find a photo of myself legit excited, but the digital world still wasn't advanced enough and was definitely not preserved really very well at all.

1006
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:15,939
Rym: But now if I die, like one, my light room stops working as soon as that credit card bounces to Adobe, which means all those bras are gone.

1007
01:08:16,381 --> 01:08:17,385
Rym: And then flicker dies.

1008
01:08:17,505 --> 01:08:19,555
Scott: when this, I have them on, I have them on a NAS.

1009
01:08:19,876 --> 01:08:20,096
Rym: Yeah.

1010
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:23,837
Rym: I got them on a NAS that'll die when like the estate doesn't know what to do with this old piece of hardware.

1011
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:24,761
Scott: Yeah.

1012
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:25,203
Scott: Right.

1013
01:08:25,363 --> 01:08:31,310
Rym: So one thing I've talked about this on GeekNights from back from the beginning, this is something I've considered seriously since high school.

1014
01:08:31,953 --> 01:08:34,122
Rym: And I'm still very serious about doing it.

1015
01:08:34,524 --> 01:08:37,656
Rym: Actually, I'm getting old enough where I should start to put this in motion more affirmatively.

1016
01:08:38,438 --> 01:08:45,899
Rym: My general plan is to form a very small trust for my death with a small amount of funding.

1017
01:08:46,282 --> 01:08:59,064
Rym: And basically I would like to do something to the effect of some number of years after my death, all the media I have ever created or all the media that was in my estate is public domain and released to the public.

1018
01:08:59,647 --> 01:09:06,747
Rym: I mean, I can make that every second after my entire hard drive, my browser history, everything.

1019
01:09:07,048 --> 01:09:12,714
Scott: The reason I would wait is that things that might even private things that might hurt other people who are that's exactly it.

1020
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:21,053
Rym: Cause they're my, you know, they're, I'm sure there are plenty of emails people have sent me where while I have the perfectly legal right to reshare those because they were sent to me.

1021
01:09:21,694 --> 01:09:28,377
Rym: Uh, I could see how someone might not want every email they ever sent to me to be released to the public.

1022
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:29,984
Rym: So I want to structure this.

1023
01:09:30,005 --> 01:09:31,211
Rym: I want to find a way to do this.

1024
01:09:31,231 --> 01:09:31,893
Rym: That makes sense.

1025
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:49,854
Rym: I don't know what the timeframe is, but imagine if like today, someone who lived in 1945, every letter they ever wrote and every photo from their entire extended, like their entire data archive just appeared and you could just dig through it and research it, explore it.

1026
01:09:50,236 --> 01:09:53,647
Rym: I would love for that to exist about people from this era.

1027
01:09:54,068 --> 01:09:55,354
Rym: And I'm willing to put up or shut up.

1028
01:09:55,374 --> 01:09:56,801
Rym: I'm willing to be one of those people.

1029
01:09:57,303 --> 01:10:05,038
Scott: But you know, well, you know that like, you know, rich people, very fabulously wealthy people will set up like the so-and-so library, right?

1030
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:06,102
Scott: Like all the presidents.

1031
01:10:06,143 --> 01:10:07,026
Scott: have them at least, right?

1032
01:10:07,107 --> 01:10:07,268
Scott: Yeah.

1033
01:10:07,308 --> 01:10:09,135
Rym: Cause they're also trying to set their image.

1034
01:10:09,315 --> 01:10:10,981
Rym: I want the raw data to go out.

1035
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:12,708
Rym: I don't want the curated like.

1036
01:10:12,969 --> 01:10:16,321
Rym: here's what rich Rym wanted you to think of him when he died.

1037
01:10:16,382 --> 01:10:27,880
Scott: I wonder if we could make an organization that's just called the U the U library and people would sign up and pay money and they would come and library people individually.

1038
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:32,577
Rym: And as long as there's enough people, you give it a donation and you have a sliding scale or whatever.

1039
01:10:32,617 --> 01:10:38,204
Scott: And the people who are currently alive are basically paying and subs, you know, paying for the everyone who came before.

1040
01:10:38,224 --> 01:10:40,635
Scott: And then the people who come after will pay for that.

1041
01:10:40,655 --> 01:10:42,664
Rym: And that's the kind of org that could figure stuff out.

1042
01:10:42,724 --> 01:10:48,409
Rym: Like what is the timeframe that makes sense from a legal and moral perspective before this data gets released.

1043
01:10:48,489 --> 01:10:51,203
Scott: But basically while you're alive, you would pay this organization.

1044
01:10:51,243 --> 01:10:54,195
Scott: They would come and, you know, archive everything about you.

1045
01:10:54,215 --> 01:10:54,938
Scott: Right.

1046
01:10:55,018 --> 01:11:00,681
Scott: And then when you, you know, pass for this world, they come and go through all your stuff and record all of it.

1047
01:11:00,962 --> 01:11:01,223
Scott: Right.

1048
01:11:01,484 --> 01:11:04,698
Scott: They don't need to take physical possession of all the objects, but at least, you know,

1049
01:11:04,938 --> 01:11:15,925
Rym: but like it has to be legally watertight to where this org could on your behalf long like go to Google and say, you have to give us access to this account so we can download the archive per this will and this contract.

1050
01:11:16,045 --> 01:11:18,295
Rym: And here's a bunch of legal theory that backs it up.

1051
01:11:18,938 --> 01:11:24,038
Scott: Now they already have stuff for that, like Apple, you can put like, but I am regardless of like.

1052
01:11:24,058 --> 01:11:29,463
Rym: if anyone else does this, this is something I'm very serious about doing before I can make a whole organization that does this.

1053
01:11:29,503 --> 01:11:36,584
Scott: The only problem is it's going to archive the lives and histories of wealthy Internet individuals.

1054
01:11:37,546 --> 01:11:40,014
Rym: archiving because that's all the history is gone.

1055
01:11:40,074 --> 01:11:41,279
Rym: Most of the letters we have.

1056
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,317
Rym: I just talked about how important it is to be able to read letters people wrote.

1057
01:11:45,357 --> 01:11:52,470
Rym: But other than letters that soldiers wrote home after wars, most of the letters we have from history are rich white people sending letters to each other.

1058
01:11:53,011 --> 01:11:56,004
Scott: I think what you should do is I think you should make it this organization.

1059
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:56,506
Scott: Right.

1060
01:11:56,747 --> 01:12:02,049
Scott: When you pay for archive yourself, you also have to pay for it to archive somebody who cannot afford it.

1061
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:03,414
Scott: Oh, that's a great idea.

1062
01:12:03,756 --> 01:12:08,154
Scott: Some other person could be some person who doesn't even have this gets into like StoryCorps.

1063
01:12:08,174 --> 01:12:10,205
Rym: Like there's other ways to archive information.

1064
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:18,460
Rym: Look at things like StoryCorps and all the groups that just like, hey, find old people and just talk to them and learn as much as you can from them and record it all for the future.

1065
01:12:18,741 --> 01:12:26,250
Rym: Like there's a lot of ways to archive data and the most important thing because we've gone on long and I'm tired and hungry.

1066
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:32,719
Rym: There's got to be a lot of different approaches to this because we don't know what technology is going to look like even 10 years from now.

1067
01:12:33,322 --> 01:12:33,563
Scott: Yeah.

1068
01:12:33,623 --> 01:12:36,536
Scott: Like you said, you might get into a trouble like with the flash situation.

1069
01:12:36,576 --> 01:12:40,591
Scott: It's like we save all this HTML and no one has any web browsers.

1070
01:12:40,872 --> 01:12:44,444
Scott: It's like all the water and you can't drink, right?

1071
01:12:44,825 --> 01:12:47,611
Scott: You got the books and your glasses, bro.

1072
01:12:51,095 --> 01:12:53,338
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1073
01:12:53,378 --> 01:12:58,534
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1074
01:12:58,755 --> 01:13:03,794
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1075
01:13:04,035 --> 01:13:06,706
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one but four different shows.

1076
01:13:06,846 --> 01:13:11,467
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1077
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:15,804
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license.

1078
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:19,316
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1079
01:13:19,517 --> 01:13:22,390
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1080
01:13:22,591 --> 01:13:42,594
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights who pay us at least $5 a month because they want us to say their name at the end of every show are Ellen Joyce, Likkeji, Dread, Lily, Teddie Brite, Kace, Kari Makes Music, Chris, The Dog, Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Hayes, Henny Reimer, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Hoh and a ton of people who do not want me to say their names.

1081
01:13:43,055 --> 01:13:45,424
Rym: So yeah, you might've noticed those YouTube shorts.

1082
01:13:46,147 --> 01:13:46,910
Rym: I did confirm.

1083
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:51,930
Rym: So let me know if they pop up annoyingly anywhere, but they should never show up in a normal YouTube feed.

1084
01:13:52,312 --> 01:13:58,312
Rym: They only show up unless you have a or you scroll down into that actual YouTube shorts feed or whatever.

1085
01:13:58,793 --> 01:14:02,446
Rym: So try to put up like one or two a day for the foreseeable future.

1086
01:14:02,466 --> 01:14:06,620
Rym: We've got a lot of panels and they're real easy to make.

1087
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,508
Rym: I've literally got like 30 of them queued up.

1088
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:13,360
Rym: So yeah, for now simply leave you.
