1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,741
Rym: It's Monday August 5th 2019.

2
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:19,210
Rym: I'm random Scott and this is GeekNights tonight USBC the connector to finally rule them all.

3
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:23,396
Scott: for now sort of Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,736
Rym: You know in GeekNights We have a story tradition of.

5
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:30,351
Rym: you know We have a very regular format over these last 14 or so years of.

6
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:37,464
Rym: we do an opening bit where we talk about our lives Then we do the news then we do a thing at the day and then I've met a moment in a main bit We have this whole thing.

7
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:41,860
Rym: So my only question is which one of us should do our opening bit first today?

8
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:42,526
Scott: It don't matter.

9
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:43,070
Rym: You don't matter.

10
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:43,615
Scott: What is it?

11
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:44,180
Scott: Who cares?

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,726
Rym: All right, so I was at work today.

13
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,783
Rym: do my normal thing around 11 Like I do.

14
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,795
Rym: I went to go have my daily poop because I am hyper regular.

15
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:54,285
Rym: now that I'm in my 30s 11 seems to be the time.

16
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,860
Scott: most dudes poop and dude, I guess you couldn't get a stall cuz everyone's poop.

17
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:01,080
Scott: I don't know cuz I know the secret because basically you go to a floor no one's poop.

18
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:14,681
Rym: There are only three stalls in each bathroom like in the bathrooms on each lot one of them you put a pair of shoes Up until the 16th floor is the floor I'm on but 17 18 19 20 21 and 22.

19
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:22,580
Rym: Daddy, like eight stalls you go up a flight of stairs I go up one flight and I'd like it pretty easy and if I really am desperate I go up to 22.

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,716
Rym: No one thinks to go up to 22 22 is an awesome floor.

21
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:26,077
Scott: No one.

22
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:30,729
Rym: on 22 There's a small office up there for like certain things like.

23
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:33,859
Scott: there's like a million stalls and only one desk and there's two.

24
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,233
Rym: it's it Basically, it's the floor with the big conference room for like big outside events.

25
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,120
Scott: So if there isn't an event, there's like no one.

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,165
Rym: Yeah, there's no one up there.

27
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,833
Rym: so I can like go out on the balcony.

28
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:43,335
Rym: It's real.

29
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:45,384
Rym: I can see the skyline I just hang out up there.

30
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:45,866
Rym: It's awesome.

31
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:49,180
Rym: But sometimes I go up there and there's a whole bunch of people and I can't poop.

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,905
Scott: Yeah, having a party.

33
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:55,039
Rym: So I have my poop like I do and I played like for nourishing my hexes during it.

34
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:56,570
Scott: You trying out those new armies?

35
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:57,759
Rym: No, they're not in the app yet.

36
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,383
Rym: Oh, okay.

37
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:01,320
Rym: I was in the app trying to figure out how to buy them and I couldn't figure it out.

38
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:08,400
Rym: Okay I don't think you can so email and I got a flush but like a good person who's worried about his health and careful.

39
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:12,693
Rym: I turn around and look before I flush as your poop just like green.

40
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:13,856
Rym: So my work yellow.

41
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,060
Rym: It was green orange.

42
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:16,594
Rym: It was the bright.

43
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:23,640
Rym: it looked like Green neon highlighter and like just taking the inside out and dropped it in like a lie.

44
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:24,906
Scott: You ate some kind of thing.

45
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:27,620
Scott: So I thought to myself what vegetable did you eat?

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,777
Rym: So I thought to myself I have never seen a color that stark before.

47
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:33,740
Scott: Let's take a photo of your poop.

48
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:34,940
Rym: No, I didn't even take a photo.

49
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,220
Rym: So I thought on it for a second because I know that green poop is like a bile thing.

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,163
Rym: But I look it wasn't.

51
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:43,097
Rym: that kind of color was way too bright, but I remembered last night.

52
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:43,940
Scott: You ate a highlighter.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,691
Rym: We went to Ice and Vice the fancy ice cream place.

54
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:47,976
Scott: You had some food coloring in your ice cream.

55
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:54,974
Rym: Their cones Have food coloring in them and I remembered back to not digestible food coloring.

56
00:02:54,994 --> 00:03:00,495
Rym: last time I went there and I had a similar incident and I realized that that is the problem.

57
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:08,787
Rym: the last time I went there I had a pink cone and the next day when I pooped it looked like I Thought I was bleeding to death for a second.

58
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:12,684
Scott: You should I remember email them and be like, hey your food coloring Makes me poop the color.

59
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,620
Rym: I should be like, hey, you could put a little less food coloring in these cones.

60
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,085
Scott: You could warn people about it.

61
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:19,590
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

62
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,300
Rym: I have an extreme ice cream warning on the door.

63
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:24,646
Rym: So what do you got?

64
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,550
Rym: is your thing today?

65
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,996
Rym: Hopefully not also poop related.

66
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:32,352
Scott: No, so Someone posted on the internet about you know, some some science.

67
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:34,037
Scott: so signed up to do the science.

68
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:35,871
Scott: Oh, yeah Yeah that thing.

69
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:48,163
Scott: so basically Someone at Columbia is researching the associations between like air pollution biking to work You know cardio Whatever

70
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:56,321
Rym: makes sense because on one hand you want to do a lot of cardio But on the other hand like especially in a city doing a lot of cardio every day means some days the air is really bad Right,

71
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:57,044
Scott: so basically

72
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:57,947
Rym: more pollution.

73
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:58,790
Scott: So yes.

74
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,169
Scott: Anyway, I signed up to go do this study, you know, help them out Cuz it's of interest to me.

75
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,019
Scott: It's not the kind where they pay you.

76
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:11,580
Scott: So apparently you only really get paid for Scientific studies and a. they got a lot of grant money and they're having a hard time finding people to do it for free.

77
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,431
Scott: I got paid at RIT once yeah, and B they do it you.

78
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:18,459
Scott: they usually pay people when you're like you're doing something risky, right?

79
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,437
Scott: It's like take this experimental medicine and it's like we'll give you money.

80
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:24,320
Scott: All right

81
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:31,150
Rym: I remember one of my RIT professors talking about how he did a study where they paid him like a hundred bucks Which in the 70s, that's

82
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,693
Scott: a lot of money,

83
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:39,139
Rym: but the study was Drink a whole bunch of alcohol and then inhale mercury vapor and see how much mercury vapor gets into your blood.

84
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:46,445
Scott: Yeah Yeah, okay anyway, so I went up there and they gave me a whole bunch of sensors and shit So that they gave me.

85
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,415
Scott: the first thing they gave me are these two.

86
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:49,219
Scott: I have them over here.

87
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,220
Scott: I had to carry them around so I had to do it six times.

88
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:59,646
Scott: So basically six 24-hour periods over three weeks, but not consecutively Not on consecutive days.

89
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,967
Scott: So I had to do basically two days a week for three weeks But not two days in a row ever.

90
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,120
Scott: All right, and I got a bike to work on those days.

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,625
Scott: Otherwise is you know, what's the point right?

92
00:05:07,987 --> 00:05:13,007
Scott: So they gave me two different kinds of air pollution sensor things They gave me.

93
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,002
Scott: is I got to carry them around and they're just always drinking the air I guess.

94
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:24,240
Scott: and then they gave me this hexo skin shirt Which is like a undershirt thing and it has a little data recorder.

95
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,148
Rym: Oh, it will it catch your log respiration rate and all that it has.

96
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,160
Scott: basically it's like an easy G situation with three contact points.

97
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,751
Rym: Oh, so it's not doing the chest expansion thing.

98
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:44,380
Scott: and also it has these two hex Strips that go around my entire body and I guess they can tell when I'm my body is stretching And they use that to measure how much air I've worn.

99
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:48,934
Rym: I've worn one of those something very similar before right because I guess they do some cut.

100
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,921
Scott: she's like, yeah, you do some volume Right.

101
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:54,494
Scott: It's like if your chest expands this much that means this much air came out.

102
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,920
Scott: and if the air pollution is this much That means you breathe in this many particles.

103
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:09,080
Rym: Things I know because I've done a bunch of medical things with those that kind of equipment before and I've been thinking about buying One of those strap sensors, I don't need the EKG nonsense, but I like the respiration sensor

104
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:10,186
Scott: anyway, so cuz

105
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:12,077
Rym: I'm trying to train more seriously in the running.

106
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:19,159
Scott: and then Basically a blood pressure monitor that you can like wear and it checks your blood pressure periodically just on its own.

107
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:23,520
Scott: And then she's like do you want to take this extra thing?

108
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,860
Scott: It's like you don't have to and it was basically this thing some dude in Belgium made.

109
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:31,660
Scott: So the dude in Belgium wants it's like a separate study, but it's related.

110
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:33,119
Scott: So it's like you can do both at once.

111
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:40,385
Scott: He wants to know about if there's a relation between like noise and air pollution like yeah It's noisier.

112
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:43,559
Scott: then that means there's more cars and shits is more pollution, right?

113
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,179
Scott: So he basically I'm pretty sure it's an Arduino in a box.

114
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:53,900
Scott: But yeah as far as I'm concerned It's just a box and I just tie the box to my bike and plug it in when I ride and that's it.

115
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:59,580
Scott: So I'm just gonna carry this shit around six times and then I don't have to go back to stupid Columbia.

116
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,137
Scott: I they're just gonna come and get the stuff.

117
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:04,179
Scott: I don't have to go back there.

118
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:08,460
Rym: I'm glad you're doing this cuz I have a vested interest in the results of this kind of research, right?

119
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,426
Scott: So we're gonna find out.

120
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:11,700
Scott: it's like well, you know you bike to work.

121
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,470
Scott: Oh so healthy, but you breathe in all this poison.

122
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,200
Scott: if you were in a car that has filters on its air intakes.

123
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:18,832
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't breathe the poison.

124
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:22,673
Rym: you would just poison everyone And it'll probably figure like what's the balance between?

125
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:27,720
Rym: yes, the pollution is bad for you But the exercise is better for you than the pollution is right.

126
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,860
Scott: It's like my blood pressure like worse when I'm biking in a bad place.

127
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,684
Rym: Well kind of like.

128
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,516
Scott: I also have to use Strava and send her my struggle files.

129
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:40,079
Rym: Oh, no You saw Strava had a big outage the other day.

130
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,486
Scott: I didn't notice they were.

131
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:46,247
Rym: basically if you went into the app and had a big banner that was like yo We know we're having problems.

132
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:47,331
Rym: Stop read.

133
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,640
Rym: Stop restarting the app over and over again.

134
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,890
Rym: It's just making things worse.

135
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,555
Rym: We're gonna fix it.

136
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:52,140
Rym: Just give us time.

137
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,968
Rym: Seriously, calm down kids.

138
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,940
Scott: You shouldn't tell people just fix it.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,840
Rym: Don't look as if they were trying to fix it.

140
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,993
Rym: But apparently people kept saying oh my runs aren't sinking.

141
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:04,227
Rym: and they kept like yeah Well, that's tough shit.

142
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,920
Scott: Just make sure that shouldn't affect whether you make it work or not.

143
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,151
Scott: Yeah, just go to your firewall and block everybody until you fix your shit.

144
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:11,696
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I agree.

145
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:16,718
Scott: as a product manager If it's down you might as well just block them having time out.

146
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:22,900
Rym: Yep Also Strava unlike say a real work thing not that important if it's down for a little while.

147
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,121
Scott: Yeah, it's not the end of the world It's not.

148
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:26,710
Rym: it's not a Sev one at the data center.

149
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:32,792
Scott: if I was the boss of Strava and they're like Strava is down Oh my god, I'd be like, yeah, well, you know, it's like.

150
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,740
Scott: worst case, you know, don't work on the weekend.

151
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,126
Scott: Worst case all the premium people.

152
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,440
Scott: we can just you know, refund them for the weekends worth of money, right?

153
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,374
Rym: Yeah, give them some sort of bonus fake feature.

154
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:48,156
Scott: Yeah, everyone gets a free month If you're if you're a premium buy whatever pays for that because I it doesn't do any.

155
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,280
Scott: I don't know any feature.

156
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:52,552
Scott: It's on the premium that I does as I feel I need to pay for.

157
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:54,580
Rym: it has a safety feature that I don't really need.

158
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,942
Scott: What do you mean?

159
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:56,624
Scott: safety feature?

160
00:08:56,664 --> 00:09:02,300
Rym: so you can basically list other Strava users and like people as your contacts and you can tell it.

161
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:06,237
Rym: I'm going for a run and I want my friends to track me and it'll tell all of them where you are.

162
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:09,231
Rym: the whole time It has like a panic button seems not necessary.

163
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:09,914
Rym: I could.

164
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:11,060
Rym: there are use cases for that.

165
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,880
Scott: I have other apps to do that like Google trusted contact.

166
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:16,006
Rym: Yeah There are there uses for that.

167
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:19,840
Rym: people who do serious overland hiking people are at risk of assault.

168
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:21,888
Rym: No, I can see.

169
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,093
Rym: but again it worries me.

170
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:24,640
Scott: Strava is not the app for that is what I'm saying.

171
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,776
Rym: Yeah, but it's a feature and a whole bunch of this analysis stuff.

172
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:28,680
Rym: That just seems silly.

173
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,509
Scott: There's some people who are like super like.

174
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:31,750
Scott: that's.

175
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,980
Scott: their main thing is tracking the data on their body.

176
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:37,840
Scott: Yeah, but I am like they're getting home and they're spread sheeting their body daily.

177
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:44,193
Rym: I mean, I collect all this data But I don't look at it except in like the most abstract aggregate of like.

178
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:46,540
Rym: am I getting faster or slower?

179
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,823
Rym: over time How am I?

180
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:49,586
Rym: how am I doing?

181
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,532
Rym: is my 5k time actually getting worse?

182
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:53,980
Scott: got faster, but you got older and it evened out.

183
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,411
Scott: Yeah, I don't need an app to tell me that.

184
00:09:56,732 --> 00:10:05,660
Rym: so in the news this story Escalated rapidly and I think it's worth the time to unpack this because a lot of people don't understand how any of this works.

185
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,899
Rym: So back it all the way up.

186
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,880
Rym: There is a website filled with the most the second most vile people on earth called 8chan.

187
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,007
Rym: 8chan is not 4chan.

188
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,580
Rym: Yeah, because it's twice as shitty.

189
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:20,868
Rym: That's the best way to think of it.

190
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,102
Rym: the higher the number the shittier the place Like.

191
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:26,080
Scott: I feel like if you're 8chan would people get banned from 4chan?

192
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,702
Scott: I mean literally.

193
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:27,905
Scott: 8chan didn't even ban anything.

194
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:39,620
Rym: 8chan was formed by this gamer Gator dude, basically Who now who is since as vile as that dude is he has actually come out today and said that he disavows 8chan.

195
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,463
Rym: It was a mistake.

196
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:41,526
Rym: shut it down.

197
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:42,570
Rym: It is dangerous.

198
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,212
Rym: Mm-hmm.

199
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:50,415
Scott: So even that shitty gamer game That's pretty the only thing that really amazes me these days when someone changes their mind.

200
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,040
Scott: No, they didn't change his mind.

201
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:55,597
Scott: It's the vile people who somehow have a line.

202
00:10:55,617 --> 00:11:00,355
Rym: Yeah 4chan pretty vile, but they had a line that their line was like this person.

203
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,098
Scott: It's like they.

204
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:03,648
Scott: they're racist They don't unracist right?

205
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:04,953
Scott: It's like, you know, they're.

206
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:06,720
Scott: they're like, they're all these bad things.

207
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:18,589
Scott: They're misogynist and they don't they don't turn they don't change their ways They still agree with all those bad things, but then somehow at some point they're like that's too far bro, and it's like Well, are you gonna be a good person?

208
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,139
Scott: No, I just draw the line at this much badness.

209
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,515
Scott: Yeah, that's the only person that surprises me ever.

210
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:25,238
Scott: Is that person?

211
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:27,467
Scott: But does that person exist?

212
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:28,573
Scott: he's right there a chain guy.

213
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:36,080
Rym: so basically 4chan Didn't have a lot of rules, but they banned furries for cultural and internet reasons, whatever.

214
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:42,640
Rym: They banned pedophilia You know porn you don't say and they banned gamer gate.

215
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:45,446
Rym: Those are the only things that they banned.

216
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:49,900
Rym: and those people were so affronted that they made a chance.

217
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:51,052
Scott: Sorry, didn't go to H.

218
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:55,327
Rym: No the furries Everyone else went to HN.

219
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,831
Rym: the bad people went to HN.

220
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:58,977
Rym: So HN is there and it's awful.

221
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:06,160
Rym: and Three of the more recent like mass murderers in the world posted their manifestos to HN.

222
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:15,533
Rym: And if you actually go to HN Which I do not recommend you do you will find some of the most vile Hate speech and incitement to violence the world has ever seen.

223
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:17,340
Rym: Yeah, these are bad people.

224
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:21,218
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why we just don't go, you know round up everyone on HN.

225
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:25,753
Rym: The pro move would have been if HN was just a long-running honeypot.

226
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:27,559
Scott: Just swap them for the immigrants.

227
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:31,440
Rym: Just The only place worse than HN is gab.

228
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,742
Scott: Gab.

229
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:34,348
Scott: Gab is just HN reddit, right?

230
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:35,854
Rym: Yeah, Gab is like HN.

231
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,560
Rym: reddit slash Twitter.

232
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:42,179
Scott: It's a site that's like reddit, but it's you know for bad people that the kind that would go to HN.

233
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:49,445
Rym: Yeah, imagine the kind of content that even Twitter who won't ban anyone Practically would ban.

234
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,009
Rym: they go to gab and HN.

235
00:12:51,510 --> 00:13:00,293
Rym: So HN only was able to exist because Cloudflare Provided services to them like DDoS protection.

236
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:01,036
Scott: You don't know right?

237
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:01,900
Rym: It's all load balance.

238
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:12,869
Scott: So Cloudflare is a company that's been around for a while and they made their name In the back in the day because what would happen is certain sites good or bad would get DOS or DDoS.

239
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:21,939
Scott: Yep, and there is a difference a big difference Yeah, but the point is their site would go down and they did not have enough money to say You know do a Google does and run a huge worldwide network of servers.

240
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:29,631
Scott: Yeah, that are invincible and you know have a huge IT staff, you know, maybe you just got your WordPress blog But you got an awesome article that's getting really popular.

241
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,580
Scott: Yeah, and it's spreading like wildfire.

242
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,412
Scott: Maybe you got slash dotted or something, right?

243
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,440
Scott: And it's not spreading a good message.

244
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,353
Scott: But you you know, you got so much traffic you're down or because you're a good person The hate people are taking you down or you might not even it might.

245
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:46,064
Rym: you just might have a lot of traffic and it's not Even a DDoS.

246
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,994
Scott: you just you're just one person.

247
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,019
Scott: you can't handle that.

248
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:52,080
Scott: You can't handle the architecture of that nature for your use case.

249
00:13:52,221 --> 00:14:00,280
Rym: But if you have wizards working for you like between IP table There's a lot of stuff you can do on servers to mitigate that up to a point, but there's a limit, right?

250
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,699
Scott: So Cloudflare what they do is they provide basically a CDN but also other stuff and the way it works.

251
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,888
Rym: CDN is content distribution network.

252
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:11,983
Rym: in case you have no idea what we're talking about you point your DNS Right you.

253
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,171
Scott: basically Cloudflare becomes your DNS provider.

254
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:17,637
Scott: Yep, and I'm actually use them.

255
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:18,940
Scott: Yeah, it's free.

256
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:27,069
Scott: And you go there and you say okay for a front row crew calm The IP address is X and you tell them right.

257
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:30,420
Scott: and now you tell your registrar where you bought the domain.

258
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,840
Scott: Hey for DNS use Cloudflare and then you're all good.

259
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,179
Scott: And what you do is in the list of DNS the entries on Cloudflare.

260
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,423
Scott: They have these little icons.

261
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:43,760
Scott: you click and you have two options an arrow going around a cloud or an arrow going through a cloud.

262
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,736
Scott: So an arrow going around the cloud means anyone visiting front row crew calm will go directly.

263
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:54,573
Scott: their web browser Will send its easy VIP request boom directly to your web server wherever it is.

264
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:55,736
Scott: line ode Oz.

265
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:56,880
Rym: very useful for example.

266
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,092
Rym: Front end verse back end like as a content creator.

267
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:01,720
Rym: I am doing a lot of things.

268
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:10,498
Scott: I don't need this cloud protection for right and if you click the icon to go through the cloud What what will happen is when their web browser says what's the IP address of front row?

269
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:10,980
Scott: crew calm?

270
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,140
Scott: It'll actually give you an IP address for some Cloudflare server.

271
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:16,991
Scott: The HTTP request will go to the Cloudflare server.

272
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:19,440
Scott: the Cloudflare server will then go to your real server.

273
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:27,056
Scott: Get the copy of your web page and then cache it and then send it and the next person who comes visiting It's probably gonna see a cached version.

274
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:33,300
Scott: mostly You've probably seen times where people's like servers go down and you'll get like the Cloudflare error page.

275
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:35,268
Scott: It's like oh, yeah, we didn't.

276
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:41,000
Scott: we don't have a recent version of this web page and they went down You know because maybe they stopped paying for their odds or whatever.

277
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:51,393
Scott: So also in addition to providing that sort of caching CDN kind of stuff They also provide just all this sort of attack protection.

278
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:57,052
Scott: and way it works is since they have so many Customers and clients and and you know things they see.

279
00:15:57,212 --> 00:16:02,460
Rym: every kind of attack under the Sun and DDoS is hard to stop if you're the target by yourself.

280
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:05,900
Rym: But if you have the data of all the other attacks around right?

281
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,200
Scott: It's like let's say Rym's got a website and I got a website and someone attacks Rym's website with some lame-o attack.

282
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,059
Scott: Yeah, Cloudflare sees that attack.

283
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:18,520
Scott: They write a you know, some kind of rule to block it usually a simple heuristic rule like from the package themselves.

284
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,040
Rym: You can figure out if they're malicious.

285
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:28,290
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh there's an evil server over there and then suddenly every other Cloudflare customer Everyone else using Cloudflare is now protected from that exact same attack.

286
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:35,673
Scott: So and they save all these over time forever It just if you use Cloudflare, you're protected from like an insane number of attacks.

287
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:37,840
Scott: It's it actually really works.

288
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,722
Scott: It's super legit.

289
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:45,080
Scott: the people who work there regardless of your opinion of other decisions they've made which we're gonna discuss right now.

290
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,088
Scott: Yeah, their technology is Excellent and competent.

291
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:49,974
Scott: I think we've actually they.

292
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,536
Scott: When there's an internet outage.

293
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:59,360
Scott: recently They wrote the article about why it was out and remember we talked about how they were blaming some provider in Pennsylvania or something.

294
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:03,534
Scott: Yeah, that was Cloudflare doing that because their internet engineering is good.

295
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:12,920
Rym: now in terms of ethics The problem with Cloudflare is that they have taken a very extreme free speech position almost extreme.

296
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,680
Scott: They have a line just short of the most extreme free and their line was the Daily Stormer and now 8chan, right?

297
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,489
Scott: So Daily Stormer is the first thing to ever get kicked off.

298
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,135
Rym: Do not Google Daily Stormer.

299
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:26,747
Scott: It's just a Nazi newspaper Yeah, but it's nothing I know about.

300
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:29,059
Rym: it's the Nazi newspaper, right?

301
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,983
Scott: That's like I didn't know.

302
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:38,567
Scott: so they after being on Cloudflare for quite some time Cloudflare kicked it off and after a massive public protest That was and that was our.

303
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:46,380
Scott: that was a news on GeekNights because it was like the CEOs Decision to override their policy and they made a big deal about how reluctant they were to do it.

304
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:52,320
Rym: Speech right just as aside cuz I don't want to talk about that in this episode, but fuck that.

305
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:54,573
Rym: Free speech for everyone but Nazis.

306
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,875
Scott: Yeah, it's very easy Yeah, sure, but they.

307
00:17:59,063 --> 00:17:59,986
Scott: So now 8chan.

308
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,013
Scott: it took them this long to decide.

309
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:09,917
Scott: it took no one not two But three mass murders three mass murder manifestos in 8chan and Cloudflare decided that was enough.

310
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:19,464
Scott: and they're like, yeah They're sort of leaning a little bit more away from the extreme free speech being like, yeah, we're private We don't have to you know, recognize free speech here Yeah, but we try to.

311
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:23,360
Scott: and there you know what, even though they took down 8chan good job Cloudflare.

312
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:29,880
Scott: There are still plenty of hate sites that they're that are customers that they have not gotten rid of.

313
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,675
Scott: yep, and I took a sweet long as time to get rid of the two that they have gotten rid of.

314
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:38,700
Rym: and I generally want Technology providers to be agnostic to content.

315
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,693
Rym: But again, there's that you can make a very clear line on certain kinds of.

316
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,301
Scott: I think it's like people argue the slippery slope Right.

317
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:49,678
Scott: They're like, oh first the Nazis then the furries then it's like we could just stop it.

318
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:50,723
Scott: not good It's like.

319
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:54,222
Scott: it's like yeah, maybe they'll go down the slippery slope But maybe they won't.

320
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:58,497
Scott: so wait until they ban something that you're actually against before you yell at them.

321
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:06,452
Scott: Yeah, right It's like yeah, if they ban some perfectly, you know good site tomorrow, then I'll Yeah.

322
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,693
Scott: Anyway, so cloud flare good and bad.

323
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:16,109
Rym: So cloud flare kick them out Yep, but as everyone expected cloud flare, they even said something.

324
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:21,539
Rym: the effect of the problem is the problem isn't with 8chan The problem is with America.

325
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:23,868
Rym: They're gonna find another provider.

326
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:29,807
Scott: guys daily stormer did find another place to get hosted and so Tor and dark web which we talked about.

327
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:35,723
Rym: so daily stormer and and now 8chan But only temporarily.

328
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:38,191
Rym: they found a new service.

329
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,836
Rym: There's a service called bit mitigate.

330
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:41,000
Scott: Well, why are you sharing the name?

331
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,580
Rym: I'm not gonna link to them because it's gonna be talked about in this article.

332
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:52,111
Rym: But this is kind of important because bit mitigate is basically Kind of like how 8chan was formed with the people banned from 4chan.

333
00:19:52,412 --> 00:20:00,480
Rym: bit mitigate is formed with the people banned from cloud Similar technology to what cloud flare does and they basically focus on the worst people on earth.

334
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,570
Scott: It's an inferior product, but it's not.

335
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,763
Scott: you know, I guess it works, right and Works well enough.

336
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:11,160
Rym: So bit mitigate now was hosting daily stormer as far as I can or like doing protection.

337
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:17,320
Rym: Well, you have to hosting in a second for daily stormer and 8chan was my migrating over there and they were gonna be fine.

338
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:20,651
Scott: I don't know why the other like hate sites.

339
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:22,500
Scott: don't just like, you know, go right away.

340
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,550
Scott: It's like they stay with cloud for as long as they can.

341
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,434
Rym: cloud flares free.

342
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:26,680
Rym: I don't think that mitigate is free.

343
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:40,960
Rym: I mean think if you it makes like being the IT guy for the mob if you're the DDoS Protector for the Nazis You're gonna charge a premium to be like the arms dealer to these shitty people share any by an AK's on the black marketing.

344
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,522
Scott: So when this?

345
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:45,400
Scott: so when this happened, it's like well the bit mitigate which I guess is owned by some company.

346
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,393
Rym: Oh the rabbit hole gets deep.

347
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,460
Rym: you gotta read article.

348
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:50,785
Scott: So, you know It's owned by some other company.

349
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:55,985
Scott: and I was like and I said when we were discussing that when the news had reached that point Of like yeah, they're going to this company.

350
00:20:56,045 --> 00:21:00,400
Scott: I was like, well that company is still hosting their service somewhere like a data center.

351
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:02,040
Scott: I doubt they have their own data center.

352
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:06,236
Scott: so we could call the data center and let them know and the data center could fire them as a customer.

353
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:08,207
Scott: and even if they Have their own data center.

354
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,400
Scott: We can go to the data center, right?

355
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,989
Scott: You know, you could do something about the town.

356
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,660
Scott: you get them to cut the electricity off.

357
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,306
Scott: It's like, you know, that's the avenue to attack this now, right?

358
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:20,170
Scott: Especially once all the bad people are in one basket like that, right?

359
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:25,189
Scott: but as it turns out They weren't using their own data center.

360
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:26,656
Scott: They were in some data center box.

361
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:28,342
Scott: ility is Silly.

362
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:30,770
Rym: they're just an infrastructure as a service provider.

363
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,512
Rym: There's a lot of them.

364
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:32,896
Scott: Yeah, they're just a data center.

365
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:33,919
Rym: somewhere turns out.

366
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:37,509
Rym: bitmitigate Uses them as their outsource infrastructure.

367
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,640
Scott: They don't own their own computers, which I thought would be pretty rare if they did.

368
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,000
Rym: Yeah, very few people own their own and voxility was not in on this game.

369
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,052
Scott: So voxility is just like yeah fire you as a customer get the hell out of here.

370
00:21:47,193 --> 00:21:49,000
Rym: voxility basically said quote.

371
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:57,647
Rym: We provide services to ISPs and hosting resellers and as a telco we do not have access to websites hosted by Customers of our customers.

372
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:58,170
Rym: Mm-hmm.

373
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:04,040
Rym: We cannot deal with the websites directly But we are now working on removing this reseller from the network.

374
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:11,760
Rym: So basically once people figured out that bitmitigate was hosted on voxility Voxility said fuck this and just kicked him out.

375
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,287
Rym: Yeah so right now you can.

376
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:24,759
Scott: you can always keep figuring out like For them to avoid the only only by using the dark web and like hosting in their houses, but that's fine dark web Not discoverable by the average Nazi.

377
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,009
Scott: It's like how to host yourself.

378
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,280
Scott: You need a ton of money to have your own data center.

379
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:35,520
Scott: You'd have to get someone to agree to like link your data center to the internet, right?

380
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,856
Scott: It's like at some point you have to do something with someone.

381
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:39,520
Scott: It's a network.

382
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:48,089
Rym: You have to get someone to agree to network with you and if you piss everybody else off you're you're not on the internet You're just your own little net.

383
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,038
Scott: Yeah, so that's so.

384
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,548
Rym: Voxility did the right thing and the rabbit.

385
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:58,809
Rym: so now as of like Dateline right now live doing this show at like 6 45 p.m on August 5th.

386
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,773
Rym: Daily Stormer and a Chan are just down.

387
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:02,820
Rym: good like they're not.

388
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:03,524
Rym: I think

389
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:15,244
Scott: what we need people to do is we need to find Because I don't know how to find them and I want to look at them right the other hate sites that are say on cloud Flare still and be like hey cloud where you ever to they change ever to this - yeah Hey get rid of this -

390
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,739
Rym: we're gonna make a slippery slope for Nazis.

391
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:21,152
Scott: Yeah, just and just down at the bottom of the slope is Nazis.

392
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:23,180
Scott: everything else lower on the slope stays.

393
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:28,859
Rym: So bid mitigate which is already like shitty was sold to epic with a K.

394
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,350
Scott: He pik not the not fortnight.

395
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:37,049
Rym: Yeah epic with a K is basically the hosting provider for them.

396
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,638
Rym: all the vile speech on earth at this point like they own all the shitty shit and They own gab.

397
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,624
Rym: Gab is the thing we talked about earlier.

398
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:48,890
Rym: gab is where all the people to vial for Twitter and read it ended up.

399
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,563
Rym: So now we got.

400
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:53,389
Rym: basically we need to go after.

401
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:58,862
Rym: epic as a whole like that company needs to be deplatformed Mm-hmm.

402
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:03,966
Rym: So in some related news Where's the other piece here?

403
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:04,609
Rym: There's.

404
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:06,459
Rym: there's a related thing we can go after.

405
00:24:07,222 --> 00:24:15,380
Scott: So it turns out that Breitbart which is vile but not a chain vial It's just one step less vile and bright parts been mostly deplatformed.

406
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,740
Scott: It's also a place I would never go never read and if anyone did read it, I would never speak to them again.

407
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,249
Scott: Bright bar, it's still very very very vile.

408
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:24,075
Rym: and info wars similarly vile.

409
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:34,562
Rym: very related info wars and bright Bart have been largely deplatformed by a lot of the big providers but a lot of their revenue comes from Advertising.

410
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:37,895
Scott: I thought it comes from selling bullshit and selling bullshit.

411
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:48,446
Rym: Okay turns out Amazon provides the storefront to sell the bullshit and Amazon is actually the one of the largest Advertisers on bright part.

412
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:51,920
Scott: Well, Amazon is one of those people that I don't even know where they're advertising, right?

413
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,600
Scott: Yeah, literally just type some code into your site and now Amazon's running.

414
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:55,791
Scott: Yeah.

415
00:24:56,502 --> 00:25:04,050
Rym: So same as Google I would recommend all of you to direct your rage at Amazon and get them to stop Letting Breitbart be a part of their ad network.

416
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:05,920
Scott: go protest at your local Whole Foods.

417
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:18,589
Scott: So you got some news, yeah, so You know this always sorts of sort of goes down, you know every once in a while where there's the Apple rumors And then they turn out to be true.

418
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,272
Scott: usually, right?

419
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:32,854
Scott: So If you don't know by now every September used to be when it iPod season because there's back to school and When the iPod died and it became iPhones September is iPhone season.

420
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:34,440
Scott: they announced new iPhones in September.

421
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,426
Scott: They well, they announced the new Iowa.

422
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:37,449
Rym: Oh, I gotta back up a little.

423
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,116
Rym: voxility cut service to epic comm is all.

424
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:41,220
Rym: epic is down.

425
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:43,432
Rym: Okay, epic bit mitigate.

426
00:25:43,552 --> 00:25:44,317
Scott: Anyway, whatever.

427
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:49,072
Scott: so the Apple rumors, right.

428
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:58,447
Scott: so WWDC in the spring ish times is when they announce the new iOS and what features it'll have Which are inevitably gonna be on the new iPhone.

429
00:25:58,748 --> 00:26:00,793
Scott: and then that new iOS comes out.

430
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:04,826
Scott: when the new iPhone comes out in they announce It September October right.

431
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:08,960
Scott: and there's usually that's around the time back to school new phones new iOS.

432
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:13,798
Scott: It has been that way for every year since like two that more than ten years.

433
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:14,280
Scott: this way.

434
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:23,454
Scott: It's not a surprise guys every single year as if iPhone one was 2007 It has been September October every year since then.

435
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,280
Scott: do not be surprised by this.

436
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,643
Scott: Don't be like.

437
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:31,214
Scott: go when a new iPhones coming fucking September Never October you can't mess this one up guys.

438
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:36,036
Scott: All right, so And there's always rumors and people are like, you never know.

439
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:43,929
Scott: those rumors can be true But actually as it turns out for the past many years like maybe I don't know 10 fucking years The rumors always turn out to be like 80% true.

440
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:55,420
Scott: Yeah, and it's usually because of things like Leaks at factories Photos of cases because people have to have to get iPhone cases in the store at the same day as the iPhone.

441
00:26:55,902 --> 00:27:01,780
Scott: So they tell these third-party accessory makers what the iPhones are gonna be shaped like and stuff and they make cases in advance.

442
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:10,463
Scott: Right all this stuff comes out day one and even if Apple itself and their developers and their engineers are super tight There are leaks.

443
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:11,185
Scott: I saw a leak.

444
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:16,260
Scott: someone was taking a picture of a Samsung phone and leaking the Samsung phone.

445
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:28,384
Scott: They took a picture of the Samsung phone with the new unreleased iPhone XR equivalent like iPhone XR 2 or whatever and you can see a reflection of the back of that phone in the front of the New Samsung phone.

446
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:30,110
Scott: Ah, perhaps that was intentional.

447
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:32,037
Scott: Perhaps that was you know, and it's like.

448
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:34,505
Scott: I mean That was faked.

449
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:41,170
Scott: But actually in my experience I see things like that every year and it often turns out They're like almost always exactly right.

450
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,340
Rym: Well, plus go all the way back to the famous Teapot for sale, right?

451
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,685
Scott: So the new iPhones.

452
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:56,820
Scott: the biggest thing people are gonna notice visually about them Is that on the back almost all the leaked pictures show a giant square like three cameras like several camera lenses in it.

453
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,827
Scott: We're not we're beyond daddy to lens now.

454
00:27:59,107 --> 00:28:02,920
Scott: It's like, you know, since they can't have some mock three, right?

455
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,992
Scott: Well, they can't have a mechanical Zoom that's an optical zoom.

456
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:14,400
Scott: That's actually has a motor that Vertical traversal right that requires moving parts, which they really don't want in a phone, right?

457
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:21,280
Scott: So as a result, we get on phones several lenses and they're still really amazing cameras, but better than most cameras.

458
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,408
Scott: You'll buy separately.

459
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,839
Scott: Yeah, but still that's the thing.

460
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:30,140
Scott: But the main thing you got to know about iPhones this year is that Apple bought Intel's modem business?

461
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,269
Scott: There was all this crazy.

462
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,579
Rym: Oh, I forgot about that.

463
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:42,900
Scott: There's all sorts of crazy shenanigans going on with Apple Qualcomm Modem licensing all these patents for modems right radios and shit, right?

464
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,931
Scott: You can read about that on your own separately.

465
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:48,720
Scott: Just look for like Apple Qualcomm lawsuit modems radios, whatever.

466
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:59,779
Scott: But the only real other major company that made you know modem radios for you know, cell phones is Intel making 5g radios and Intel's like getting out of that business.

467
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:07,312
Scott: So Apple bought part of that business to make their own goddamn radios to try to fuck Qualcomm Putting Qualcomm shit in their phone.

468
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,480
Scott: so they can get away from that nonsense.

469
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:13,457
Scott: Right because pretty much it's Qualcomm is making the only good radios and it's not that no one else could.

470
00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:14,380
Scott: it's patents.

471
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:15,774
Scott: Mostly you're locking that one in.

472
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:22,248
Scott: Yeah so The I thinking was that what was gonna happen?

473
00:29:22,288 --> 00:29:23,271
Scott: was it next year?

474
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:26,320
Scott: 2021 would be when iPhones all had 5g radios.

475
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:30,092
Scott: But as it turns out it looks like this year.

476
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,260
Scott: they say they're all gonna have 5g radios in them.

477
00:29:32,421 --> 00:29:46,860
Scott: So if you're hankering from a certain five G's and you live in a 5g place maybe you could buy a new iPhone this year, but The other rumor that's probably true is that the iPhones this year aren't really gonna be a big upgrade from the iPhones last year.

478
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,840
Scott: All right, they're not gonna be that different.

479
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:53,117
Scott: So the ones in 2021 are gonna be a huge upgrade.

480
00:29:53,197 --> 00:30:03,880
Scott: most notably You might remember a few years ago Apple really wanted to do the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone But they didn't want to have that button at the bottom of the screen.

481
00:30:04,482 --> 00:30:17,460
Scott: So what they did is they removed the button and they couldn't get the fingerprint sensor to work when it was behind the actual Screen, so what they did instead is they put the notch up top with the face unlock Right and the face unlock is okay.

482
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:29,541
Scott: But Apple still really wants the fingerprint sensor behind the screen Because that means they can get rid of the notch and have a phone That is a hundred percent screen on the front and it looks like in 2021.

483
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:36,052
Rym: Now I'm still fine with phones that just put the fingerprint sensor as a swipe on the side But I guess Apple doesn't want you to swipe.

484
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:37,440
Scott: They want you to just put your finger there.

485
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,795
Scott: Yeah, like magic that swipe is no good because there's too much user stuff going on.

486
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:43,140
Scott: Yeah, that's not the Apple way.

487
00:30:43,441 --> 00:31:04,488
Scott: Yeah, so it looks like 2021 is gonna be the iPhone that has Not only fingerprint sensor behind the screen a hundred percent screen on the front of the phone and 5g But also most importantly the rumor is that the iPhone from this year 29 not 2021 2020 20 still 2019 Subtracting

488
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:05,334
Rym: yourself subtract

489
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:06,180
Scott: a year from all the years.

490
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,930
Scott: I said the 2019 phone will be a minor upgrade.

491
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,994
Scott: 2020 will be a big upgrade.

492
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:18,420
Scott: the 2019 phone despite being all this other stuff is supposedly gonna have all still lightning cables.

493
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:27,820
Scott: And supposedly the 2020 phone the major upgrade might finally go to USB C which we're gonna talk about in real soon.

494
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,064
Scott: Yeah, so my plan as of now and there is also some talk that they are gonna make small phone because middle sized phone Doesn't sell.

495
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,060
Scott: well people want big voter small phone.

496
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,700
Rym: Yeah, and I'm and this is something most interesting because small phone might come out this year.

497
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:53,918
Scott: But I'll probably wait and I'll get the 2020 small iPhone That's a hundred percent screen to finally replace the iPhone 7 and hold on to that phone for ever.

498
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:57,989
Rym: if they Actually release a small iPhone that's small enough.

499
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,380
Rym: I'll probably switch when the last of my Xperia compacts dies.

500
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:04,254
Scott: It's not gonna be that small.

501
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,070
Rym: Yeah We'll see how small it actually is.

502
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,440
Rym: Yeah, because right now it's not gonna be iPhone 5 small.

503
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,225
Rym: I don't think I still hold in my hand.

504
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:16,540
Rym: the Sony xz1 compact is literally the last small Android phone.

505
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:18,586
Scott: Hey, Amanda, I got the pixel 3a.

506
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:19,249
Scott: It's way good.

507
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:19,931
Scott: It's not.

508
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:22,700
Scott: it's not as small as that but also not waterproof.

509
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:24,228
Rym: I don't think I think it is.

510
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:25,514
Rym: Is it fully waterproof?

511
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:26,620
Rym: like take a picture in the pool?

512
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,404
Scott: I don't fucking know.

513
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:28,874
Rym: because this is I don't know.

514
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:33,254
Scott: but the point is If I had to get an Android phone, I would get that phone.

515
00:32:33,977 --> 00:32:34,780
Rym: I've you know what I did.

516
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,371
Scott: I wouldn't get Android, you know, my next Android phone is.

517
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:46,437
Rym: I actually own another one of this For the next two or three years at least.

518
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:49,473
Rym: unless they make a small iPhone that'll switch.

519
00:32:49,815 --> 00:32:53,980
Rym: because I Have a smartwatch after the pebble died.

520
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:57,812
Rym: There really aren't good Android smartwatches like every sound.

521
00:32:57,873 --> 00:33:01,187
Scott: that Apple watch is the only smartwatch worth of shit I have a lot.

522
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:05,450
Scott: if I was an iOS with Apple watch I would just go back to what I did before of no watch.

523
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,656
Rym: Yeah, I kind of did.

524
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:09,042
Rym: I stopped were in my LG.

525
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:15,683
Scott: Apple watch is the only smartwatch worth of shit except since pebble died and the Apple I watch still Wallets great.

526
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:21,996
Rym: It has still like very deep flaws like what a battery doesn't just last two weeks Last a whole day.

527
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:26,260
Scott: Yeah More than a day unless you do something stupid like run Strava directly on it.

528
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:27,650
Scott: Yeah, you know.

529
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:34,898
Scott: in which case like for example I use Strava on my watch and I went to summer streets and I biked around for several hours and came home.

530
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:35,340
Scott: and the what?

531
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,618
Scott: I brought no phone with me.

532
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:44,347
Scott: The watch was doing all the GPS all the Strava all the upload all and if you're not aware of this out there GPS like to actually do.

533
00:33:44,368 --> 00:33:46,334
Rym: GPS takes a ton of power right?

534
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:49,729
Scott: my watch has LTE in it So it was a phone at the same.

535
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:56,011
Scott: it was a phone and when I got home 40% battery left after several hours and a tiny watch.

536
00:33:56,312 --> 00:33:59,240
Scott: that's pretty fucking good with the color screen and all the stuff it does.

537
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:00,126
Scott: Right.

538
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:02,060
Scott: can't complain about the battery life in the Apple.

539
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,870
Scott: I yep, so charge it when you sleep and you.

540
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:04,454
Scott: I've never had it.

541
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:05,480
Scott: I've never had it run out ever.

542
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:12,420
Rym: So supposedly the next round of fossil Android wear watches for their fossil.

543
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,690
Scott: I guess they'll be stylish at least.

544
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:23,487
Rym: the might also be expensive Yeah, but they will have battery lives that are up to five or six days Depending it's all rumors.

545
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:25,480
Scott: We don't see how much is it gonna do though?

546
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,379
Scott: One Strava directly on it doesn't have LTE like a phone.

547
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:40,440
Scott: Is it like it's not doing all the stuff Apple watches do and then you can't really directly compare that battery life, you know It's like pebble lasted battery life forever because it didn't have the kind of you know, oh, you know fancy screen

548
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:44,795
Rym: Me the most that that the pebble style screen

549
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:46,440
Scott: didn't have the features that Apple watch I

550
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:48,360
Rym: think is still the an appropriate screen.

551
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,263
Rym: I agree for for a while.

552
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:59,520
Rym: buy an Apple watch with that kind of screen and all other features the same because you don't need a watch to Do that much and frankly most of the fancy features people are trying to make watches do.

553
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:02,552
Rym: They're not that good at because it's not really the right form factor.

554
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:06,599
Scott: Well, it is Depending on which feet which feature you're talking about?

555
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:15,989
Rym: Well true, but I I think the most useful features of a watch are just getting notifications Apple wedding timers The Apple watch getting directions while you're traveling somewhere.

556
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:20,324
Scott: Apple watch does way way way more than the pebble watch does way better than it Ever did.

557
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:22,080
Scott: so you're you know, it's what you're paying.

558
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,720
Scott: You're paying the money and the battery life in exchange for the power.

559
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:35,175
Rym: So what I'm waiting to see is of all I've been watching the Android watch space for a while and they're all kind of garbage Right, and this is the first time I've seen an Android that might not be garbage.

560
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,020
Scott: Yeah, I think my feeling is if you know if you're not Apple with I with an Apple watch, right?

561
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,650
Rym: Just get a fit and only know it for fitting.

562
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,760
Scott: get either no watch at all.

563
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:48,653
Scott: I just look at your phone like I did for years.

564
00:35:48,694 --> 00:35:56,800
Scott: It was fine or Get just the cheap, but you know the Casio the regular cat the LG style no fairly works.

565
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:57,965
Rym: It's like 80 bucks.

566
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:58,387
Rym: now.

567
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:01,460
Scott: today just get the regular Casio digital watch.

568
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,971
Scott: That's just a watch and a stopwatch and doesn't?

569
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:09,240
Scott: it is just no normal ass watch for $5 But there's no doesn't do any smart anything.

570
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:11,991
Rym: I would never want a watch that tell the telling.

571
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:13,598
Rym: the time is not what I use a watch for.

572
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,545
Scott: no But the all it saves you though It's like you remember.

573
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:19,100
Scott: the goal is to not have to take your phone out of your pocket, right?

574
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,999
Scott: So half the time I take my phone in my pocket is to see Notifications and half the time I take it into my pocket is to see what time it is.

575
00:36:25,301 --> 00:36:33,614
Scott: So if I couldn't get a good watch for notifications like an Apple watch at least I could get the cheapo Casio Digital watch and reduce half the time.

576
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:34,600
Scott: I take my phone out of my pot.

577
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,965
Scott: I've always kind of hate for like $10.

578
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:42,740
Rym: in the old before there were smartwatches or smartphones or cell phones I hated the idea of wearing a watch.

579
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:48,720
Scott: I preferred pocket watches for the sole reason that so that you could say so you could be that person who has a pocket.

580
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:49,908
Rym: No, it was specifically.

581
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:57,080
Rym: I had this very particular philosophy I need to be able to know what time it is, but I don't want to constantly know what time it is.

582
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,107
Scott: Don't fucking look at your watch.

583
00:36:58,368 --> 00:36:59,153
Rym: Yeah, but it's right there.

584
00:36:59,173 --> 00:36:59,838
Rym: You might just see it.

585
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:02,260
Scott: My Apple watch is blank unless I look at it.

586
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,780
Rym: Yeah, my watch is also blank until I'd like shake it and look at it or I get a notification.

587
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:22,700
Scott: the point is anyway, this might be the first like almost usable baby's first Android smartwatch that isn't garbage since the pebble and anyone who like You know has like a Rolex and it wasn't just like the only one you have and it was grandpa's or something.

588
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:24,556
Scott: Yeah get in line for the guillotine.

589
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:36,440
Rym: But anyway, it looks like it's time for things of the day.

590
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:38,491
Scott: What the fuck was my thing of the day?

591
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:39,599
Scott: Oh, I remember now.

592
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:43,120
Scott: Yeah So Gen Con just happened and we are not fans of Gen Con.

593
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,301
Scott: Gen

594
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:47,338
Rym: Con is poorly run and I would never attend it as a guest unless they change a lot of their policies

595
00:37:47,378 --> 00:38:02,319
Scott: despite I mean Gen Con has good policies and bad policies But despite the convention organization itself and the things that they do wrong Good people go to Gen Con and good games happen there and there are Positives to going there that have nothing to do with the con.

596
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:07,140
Scott: I mean if you get some of the you know There's like really good stuff happening because good people are there playing good games, right?

597
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:19,201
Scott: And that's not Gen Con's fault nor you know, or nor will I hold it against them anyway, so Because of that there are lots and lots of gaming tweets coming from Gen Con and I was getting a lot of good stuff for Those.

598
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:23,573
Rym: Lord I have the issue of Dragon magazine where you're thinking of the day was reviewed.

Scott: That's right.

601
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:37,780
Scott: So One thing I discovered that I did not know existed before thanks to Some you know tweets from Gen Con is I would have saved this for Tuesday, but it's too good.

Rym: I remember talking to Jared at length years ago, like we should make an RPG that comes with puppets.

614
00:39:22,913 --> 00:39:23,194

Scott: Right, they made this rocky and Bullwinkle RPG.

626
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:00,250
Scott: Basically, the rules are so loose and sparse.

627
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,535
Scott: It barely qualifies.

628
00:40:01,555 --> 00:40:02,980
Scott: That's what it says in Wikipedia.

629
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:09,520
Scott: But yeah, apparently it is an amazing awesome card-based tabletop RPG.

630
00:40:10,023 --> 00:40:11,955
Scott: I want to play it because I love Rocky and Bullwinkle.

631
00:40:12,116 --> 00:40:12,800

00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,686
Scott: Then I cancel game pro like after freshman.

654
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:07,100
Rym: my mom keeps threatening to send me all my dragon magazines and all my Nintendo Powers.

657
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,112
Scott: That's a PAX West.

658
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:16,060
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'll take your dragon magazines.

00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:19,875

Scott: somebody will.

663
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:26,055
Scott: there is a good home for them.

664
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:27,360
Scott: I gave my game pro magazines.

665
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:34,697
Scott: I looked on Craigslist and when we lived in beacon, I remember that Teacher who lived nearby who wanted to cut him up for arts and crafts class.

666
00:41:34,737 --> 00:41:37,353
Scott: that I said go nuts I can just get PDFs of these online.

667
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:40,572
Scott: I Don't need the physical ones taking a space in my apartment.

668
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:41,880
Rym: So my thing today is real brief.

669
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:43,970
Rym: I didn't want to use a cuz.

670
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:52,360
Rym: lately a lot of our things that they have been tweets Or very short YouTube videos things of the day are finding are hard to come by in a dark world.

671
00:41:52,824 --> 00:42:00,542
Rym: Yep Also, we've set the bar a little high in the sense that things that might have been like good enough to be a thing of The day back in 2010

672
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:04,019
Scott: I raised the bar with my good things of the day and then you were embarrassed with your bad things of the day.

673
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:04,763
Scott: now You're trying to.

674
00:42:04,864 --> 00:42:05,749
Scott: you know, I'd love to see.

675
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:07,398
Rym: we still need to do the thing of the day off.

676
00:42:07,781 --> 00:42:08,527
Scott: I think they are.

677
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:09,071
Rym: we just need to.

678
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:10,260
Scott: you cannot win the thing.

679
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:16,800
Rym: We need to bring our top ten things of the day of all time and get the listener Things of the day that we've already used as things of the day.

680
00:42:16,822 --> 00:42:19,480
Rym: Yeah You go back and we each bring to the table.

681
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:28,991
Rym: Well We think our own personal 10 best and we let the listener decide which one of us based on that set of 20 Truly is the king of the things of the day.

682
00:42:29,011 --> 00:42:31,160
Rym: All right, that'll be a fun show to do someday.

683
00:42:31,903 --> 00:42:36,200
Rym: But so this is an article from a blog of going medieval that I read occasionally.

684
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:42,520
Rym: I bump into it every now and then and it's just like fun explorations of how you don't know shit about the Middle Ages.

685
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:46,372
Scott: No, cuz it was dark and there wasn't a lot of recorded history.

686
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:48,700
Rym: No, no, it's actually there's a lot of recorded history.

687
00:42:49,041 --> 00:43:00,320
Rym: But most people just when they imagine the word like medieval times a castle and peasants They imagine shit covered peasants like marching to war against other shit covered peasants.

688
00:43:00,641 --> 00:43:06,200
Rym: Well Knights on horses ride behind them and take a all those castles and crap.

689
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:17,160
Rym: But a common misconception of the medieval time watery tarts flinging swords And the Middle Ages is that people didn't bathe and this is a pretty direct explanation of it.

690
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:23,140
Rym: Not only did medieval people bathe, but they fucking loved taking baths.

691
00:43:23,308 --> 00:43:24,865
Scott: Yeah Cuz everything's so fucking filthy.

692
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:34,864
Scott: you will take in a bath and it goes in if you get all slimy and sweaty After a whole weekend of biking and the shower truck broke down when you get home and shower Baby.

693
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,660
Scott: so you worked in the fields all day.

694
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:41,072
Scott: Yeah You know harvesting whatever the fuck potatoes for some night.

695
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:43,060
Scott: who had a castle that protected you?

696
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:51,894
Scott: No, the night nobleman swerve and you finally get some free time with your family And there's like a is a pond and you can go in that pond and babe.

697
00:43:52,596 --> 00:44:02,760
Rym: It's like the best Peasant coming through like you can even tell yep But not only could meet evil bathe but the point the meta point this article makes is great.

698
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:04,708
Scott: Rome came first in.

699
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:05,554
Scott: Rome had bathhouse.

700
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:06,580
Scott: They had bathing technology.

701
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:09,668
Rym: But you asked the average person like who is dirtier?

702
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:13,599
Rym: the Roman like people constantly talk about how medieval people dirty.

703
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:21,672
Rym: in Rome You had bath houses, but this article points out Romans bathed primarily with oil and did not have modern soap.

704
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,738
Rym: fucking medieval people invented soap.

705
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:24,320
Scott: That's right.

706
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,247
Rym: So this article is pretty good.

707
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:27,733
Scott: I mean, I mean a lot of.

708
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:28,194
Scott: today.

709
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:29,540
Scott: a lot of people are using oil for soap.

710
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:34,259
Scott: Yeah, good use soap or soap with oil in it, which is fine do not the?

711
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:45,095
Rym: Depending on the era of Rome and those times a common way to bathe was to basically Douse yourself in olive oil and then scrape it off with a shell or a stick.

712
00:44:45,597 --> 00:44:48,146
Scott: That is pretty good It's okay feels good though.

713
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:49,572
Rym: It does not de-stinkify.

714
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:51,820
Scott: However, but how it makes you smell like olive.

715
00:44:53,082 --> 00:45:08,416
Rym: But oh, I can't find there's a link from this article To tell why I like this blog that gets into the history of nofap November and why it is mostly Promoted by vile people, okay It's surprisingly related to the concept of medieval bathing.

716
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:09,180
Scott: interesting.

717
00:45:09,221 --> 00:45:13,071
Rym: Yeah In the meta moment the econized book a book is the first novel.

718
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:18,800
Scott: the tale of Genji the first novel ever Written by humans ever is still available for you to read.

719
00:45:19,101 --> 00:45:21,413
Scott: So why wouldn't you read it before reading any other novel?

720
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:22,418
Scott: you gonna start with volume one?

721
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:29,360

00:45:34,294 --> 00:45:35,140
Rym: We have our flaws.

724
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:39,937
Rym: We could get kids but we are above the line of being banned from packs for being shitty.

725
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:40,419

742
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:42,499
Rym: But let's get into the main bit.

743

Rym: So we are not going to get into the deep technical specifications of USB because we don't fucking know.

744
00:46:49,360 --> 00:47:01,806
Rym: that's why and I'm gonna say I know a lot about all USB both the cabling standards the signaling standards everything up until USB to USB 3.

745
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:03,675
Rym: I know enough because it matters.

746
00:47:04,077 --> 00:47:08,820
Rym: and now USB is at the point to where you don't need to know unless you work in the hardware.

747
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:13,677
Scott: We did do an episode before about USB in general, but USB C wasn't a thing then.

748
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,560
Scott: so let me set you straight.

749
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,827
Scott: Just real summary right now.

750
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:17,919
Scott: There's two different things to got to worry about.

751
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:23,056
Scott: There's USB ABC letters and there's USB 1 2 3 numbers.

752
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:25,262
Scott: They are Disconnected.

753
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:30,517
Scott: you could have USB A and B cable right with a on one and B on the other.

754
00:47:30,537 --> 00:47:31,941
Scott: that's talking about the shape of The cable.

755
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,368
Rym: well that's talking about the shape and the wires.

756
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:37,397
Rym: answer right and you can have a to a.

757
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:43,233
Scott: yes Yes, micro a to me doing the summary not the details.

758
00:47:43,273 --> 00:47:44,196
Rym: Yeah, I wouldn't.

759
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,640
Scott: letters are about the cable.

760
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,824
Scott: What does the cable look like?

761
00:47:46,845 --> 00:47:47,708
Scott: where does it plug into?

762
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:48,752
Scott: what wires are inside?

763
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:50,900
Scott: right the numbers are about?

764
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,826
Scott: What's going over the cable?

765
00:47:52,986 --> 00:47:56,560
Scott: right if it's a USB 1 cable that ain't doing shit for you in 2019?

766
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:05,572
Scott: Yeah, a USB 2 cable is carrying USB 2 speeds with USB 2 devices Right USB 3 with the blue inside to let you know that you can plug in.

767
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:15,681
Rym: you know your high speed devices on that line Even though a fun fact almost every device you use is using USB 2 even if it's on a 3 almost everything is still using 2.

768
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:18,570
Scott: so USB C is a new cable shape.

769
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,660
Scott: you've probably seen it cuz it's really advancing quite quickly.

770
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:25,393
Scott: You know most desktop motherboards these days have at least one or two on there.

771
00:48:25,413 --> 00:48:27,260
Scott: Yeah, new MacBooks only have them.

772
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,510
Scott: They just got two on each side.

773
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,034
Scott: That's it.

774
00:48:29,377 --> 00:48:34,353
Rym: Yeah Nintendo my computer which I built a while ago already has one USB C on the back.

775
00:48:34,374 --> 00:48:36,279
Scott: Nintendo Switch has one on the bottom.

776
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:40,380
Scott: most Newphones that aren't Apple phones with lightning had all this to have them on the bottom.

777
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,885
Rym: I love always does this.

778
00:48:42,046 --> 00:48:43,370
Scott: we're gonna do a cable.

779
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:45,237
Scott: new iPads have it on the bottom.

780
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:45,819
Scott: right.

781
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:48,689
Scott: apples Put it on everything except for iPhones which have lightning.

782
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:49,472
Scott: everything else.

783
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:51,780
Scott: everything else at Apple has USB C now.

784
00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:53,648
Scott: So it's a different cable shape.

785
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:56,160
Scott: It looks like sort of like a hamburger patty.

786
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:59,634
Scott: It's just flat on the top and bottom and round on the sides.

787
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:00,820
Rym: I guess I can see that.

788
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,513
Rym: That's not how I would have described.

789
00:49:02,593 --> 00:49:06,540
Scott: you describe it I don't know a cylinder that got hammered from both sides.

790
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:10,091
Rym: I guess I would just describe it as a pancake.

791
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:12,800
Rym: Oh, I know a wide oval wide oval.

792
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,939
Scott: It's flat on top and bottom and runs on a blade shape anyway.

793
00:49:16,742 --> 00:49:19,329
Scott: It's the best part about it is it goes in both ways.

794
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:24,906
Scott: yep swings both ways everybody because no more Four-dimensional USB cables.

795
00:49:24,947 --> 00:49:25,990
Scott: you put it in it doesn't go.

796
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:30,331
Rym: I don't have to take off my belt anymore to explain Turn it around it doesn't go.

797
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:31,760
Scott: you turn it around a third time now.

798
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,786
Scott: If it's no you see just goes in.

799
00:49:34,127 --> 00:49:35,852
Scott: it goes in very quite securely.

800
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:41,360
Scott: like I can put a USB C cable in and like swing My phone around a little bit and be not my phone.

801
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,124
Scott: But you know get.

802
00:49:42,244 --> 00:49:45,320
Scott: you can swing a device around and be kind of confident.

803
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,418
Scott: It's not gonna like become detached and fall off unless you know you it's pretty secure connection there right.

804
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:58,994
Rym: yep Here's the other very important thing about it Micro USB which up until recently has been the standard.

805
00:49:59,014 --> 00:49:59,115
Rym: like.

806
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:09,133
Rym: the only things that use mini USB are Old old old thing or cheap things or a full-size USB b-side Shitty old printers and scanners.

807
00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:10,280
Rym: pretty much it yeah.

808
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:15,674
Scott: But micro USB is what a lot of phones were using before USB C and my old devices.

809
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,840
Rym: extremely good for the time.

810
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,331
Rym: But it had one very and only goes in one way which?

811
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:24,200
Scott: but it was fine because I was a real cheap and flimsy.

812
00:50:24,823 --> 00:50:26,290
Rym: I would know that actually that's not.

813
00:50:26,772 --> 00:50:28,500
Rym: it was not flimsy nor was it cheap.

814
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:33,337
Rym: That was the problem because the USB micro connector has moving parts.

815
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:40,380
Rym: it requires these Springs and these little teeth to make it work and those are great, but that means those cables wear out.

816
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,220
Scott: Yeah They're not great.

817
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:46,900
Rym: There was a time a few years ago where like a lot of people all at once started randomly complaining about like cables breaking.

818
00:50:47,262 --> 00:50:50,480
Rym: That's just because those cables have a limited number of insertions before they fail.

819
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,767
Scott: And why do we even need micro and mini USB?

820
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:54,593
Scott: because regular USB was too big.

821
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:57,764
Scott: think about a regular USB cable for your computer Like that your mouse has.

822
00:50:57,784 --> 00:51:00,234
Scott: hey you have a phone with that kind of pole on.

823
00:51:00,275 --> 00:51:01,600
Scott: it's an enormous fucking phone.

824
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,760
Rym: It was that's the a-side the b-side of full-size USB that goes in your scanner.

825
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:09,191
Rym: It's a square that is literally thicker than my thick ass.

826
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:09,953
Rym: Android phone.

827
00:51:10,013 --> 00:51:10,274
Scott: right.

828
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,819
Scott: so the best thing.

829
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:14,620
Scott: another thing My USB C. Is that it's so small.

830
00:51:15,225 --> 00:51:18,523
Scott: We you can use it on desktop Phone.

831
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:20,733
Scott: we don't need big and small.

832
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:22,140
Scott: It's just one size.

833
00:51:22,322 --> 00:51:23,072
Scott: It's small enough.

834
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:34,451
Scott: already every device whether it's a giant desktop or a TV or a tiny phone or like a headphone that needs to be recharged can All just use normal USB C. We don't need a micro version.

835
00:51:34,632 --> 00:51:38,745
Rym: so here are the other two important things about the physicality Point number one it.

836
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:42,580
Rym: the two sides the cable are also the same.

837
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:53,088
Scott: You don't need an a-side and a b-side you can just use either side for a or B. So if you when we have printers and scanners and all these things finally switch to USB C You won't need to get some weird cable.

838
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:56,300
Scott: That's like as a big one on one side or anything like that.

839
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:01,337
Scott: You'll just every cable will just be the same USB C thing on both fucking sides.

840
00:52:01,678 --> 00:52:02,300
Scott: end of story.

841
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:03,765
Scott: No more muss and fuss.

842
00:52:04,006 --> 00:52:07,780
Rym: now there are a side and b-side pin layouts.

843
00:52:08,223 --> 00:52:10,620
Rym: But you don't need to worry about that.

844
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,832
Scott: Yeah, the devices will just figure out like oh, I'm on the a-side perp.

845
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:15,559
Scott: I'm on the b-side perp.

846
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:18,639
Rym: Yep Because the cables have a bunch of pins.

847
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:23,700
Rym: The pins are all shielded and wired in such a way to where they can do the things they're intended for.

848
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,300
Rym: I don't want to get into why you twist cables and why you have cable pairs.

849
00:52:27,743 --> 00:52:30,680
Rym: We talked about that in the episode we did about ethernet a long long time.

850
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:32,840
Scott: Yeah, that USB C has so many wires in it.

851
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,520
Scott: It has so many features on those wires and it can reuse the different wires for different things based on what's going on.

852
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:39,423
Rym: Here's some examples.

853
00:52:39,444 --> 00:52:41,913
Rym: You can just put DisplayPort like over USB C.

854
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:43,540
Scott: Yeah, you don't need DisplayPort cables.

855
00:52:43,781 --> 00:52:51,218
Scott: There's no reason you couldn't just make a computer that has only USB C in the back and like nothing else like the.

856
00:52:51,258 --> 00:52:56,240
Scott: instead of a HDMI and DisplayPort output just a USB C and you plug a cable into your monitor.

857
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,234
Scott: There you go, but the video signals going over the USB C cable Thunderbolt fine, whatever.

858
00:53:01,254 --> 00:53:03,440
Rym: Yeah, and a log audio.

859
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:11,160
Rym: It'll actually just use the USB 2 pairs because it has some pins that are just to be used for USB 2 support.

860
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,184
Scott: Yeah, I actually use that.

861
00:53:12,205 --> 00:53:17,008
Scott: so like my for example, my iPad has USB C on the bottom and this is Apple No headphone jack.

862
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:25,788
Scott: There's a little adapter you can get from Apple but you can get a third-party one as USB C on one end and headphone hole on the other end and It's not some special thing.

863
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:26,974
Scott: It doesn't really need a chip.

864
00:53:27,235 --> 00:53:28,300
Scott: the iPad just knows.

865
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:38,407
Scott: Oh, there's a headphone being plugged in and over those wires It sends ground, you know left audio channel right audio channel And then the microphone one on the.

866
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:40,817
Scott: you know, cuz TRS right tip ring ring sleeve.

867
00:53:40,857 --> 00:53:42,683
Scott: That's four things Yep, four pins.

868
00:53:42,984 --> 00:53:48,080
Scott: So and then it just it's this analog audio coming out of the digital USB C hole.

869
00:53:48,421 --> 00:53:52,278
Scott: That's normally digital and then it goes right into your normal analog headphones.

870
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:52,700
Scott: And there you go.

871
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,580
Scott: You're listening to music with a headphone jack, even though it's plugged into USB C hole.

872
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,048
Scott: You could actually have a computer.

873
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:01,235
Scott: your desktop could go without sound card.

874
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:02,599
Scott: theoretically, right?

875
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,800
Scott: It would just need a digital analog converter and you could plug headphones into the USB C hole on your computer.

876
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,859
Scott: Theoretically if someone made that work with the right drivers and shit.

877
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,527
Rym: Yep so a step back a little bit.

878
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:21,468
Rym: USB stands for universal serial bus because in the old days the idea was Get a million different cables like the ps2.

879
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,640
Scott: There was a lot of parallel ones, which is why you need serial ones.

880
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:29,420
Scott: They refer to our USB episode and skip this entire section of Rym reiterating it

881
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:38,928
Rym: No, no, but the point I want to get at is that While you every time USB could have been the one connector and cable to rule them all there were always these niche use cases.

882
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:44,045
Rym: like you old USB you couldn't send like Streaming data over it.

883
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:45,490
Scott: It wasn't fast enough.

884
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:48,800
Rym: It wasn't fast enough didn't have enough cables and it wasn't real time.

885
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:50,708
Rym: Yeah, so bit by bit.

886
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:54,980
Rym: you always needed USB could cover a lot of cases But you still needed firewire.

887
00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:03,720
Scott: It was just for like mice keyboard 56k external motors external USB sticks without a really slow.

888
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:12,640
Scott: It's like as time went on they made them faster without changing the connector and then more and more use cases came up where it's like Oh, you can have external stuff now doing this.

889
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:25,892
Rym: yep, but along the way material science got better and we started needing a DC power plug standard because almost every device you use Uses DC and AC is what comes out of the holes.

890
00:55:26,113 --> 00:55:26,876
Rym: Yeah in your house.

891
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:30,970
Scott: Yep in America Yeah, and most of the world pretty much everywhere.

892
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:33,419
Rym: No nowhere has just DC to the house.

893
00:55:34,062 --> 00:55:38,200
Scott: I mean, oh, there's some signs and there are some places where like they have DC power lined up.

894
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:41,750
Rym: Yeah, like in data centers on boss bar.

895
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:42,492
Scott: Yeah, that kind of stuff.

896
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:42,633
Scott: Yeah.

897
00:55:42,874 --> 00:55:43,897
Rym: Yeah, I'd not in your house.

898
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:44,680
Scott: Someone's house.

899
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,125
Rym: No, someone's house.

900
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:49,880
Rym: miss some horrible nerd who's probably there's probably a burnt skeleton.

901
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,508
Scott: I'm googling house with DC power.

902
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,634
Rym: I've seen nerds try to make stuff like that.

903
00:55:54,674 --> 00:55:55,456
Rym: It's not a good idea.

904
00:55:55,476 --> 00:55:58,106
Rym: Someone's ass, but We're fine.

905
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:01,680
Rym: now that USB sort of became the powering standard.

906
00:56:02,162 --> 00:56:07,421
Rym: We're very close to the point with USB C where we literally will have one cable to rule them All.

907
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:11,820
Rym: the only cable we need to destroy is the lightning cable.

908
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:14,495
Rym: Yeah, because lightning can just go over USB C cable, right?

909
00:56:15,521 --> 00:56:23,620
Scott: The only thing that's using lightning cables is iPhones And some things and some peripherals that early adopters mistakenly bought.

910
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,995
Scott: Well, there are some iPhone accessories that use lightning like.

911
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:26,860
Scott: I think there's like beats.

912
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:31,518
Scott: I had beats headphones once and you had to recharge them with lightning because they they were meant to be used.

913
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:32,060
Scott: with the iPhones.

914
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,910
Scott: They're like, oh you got an iPhone you got.

915
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,378
Scott: use lightning to charge this headphone to.

916
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:37,624
Scott: Anyway, yeah.

917
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:41,540
Scott: Yeah USB C is finally one cable one shape.

918
00:56:41,821 --> 00:56:52,275
Scott: You can run anything over the cable you can run, you know your mouse keyboard your phone You're just plug your monitor in high back plug your cam.

919
00:56:52,315 --> 00:56:53,359
Scott: all my can't like cameras.

920
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:56,839
Scott: now I'll have USB C to transfer a 4k video off the camera.

921
00:56:57,101 --> 00:57:01,619
Scott: Yeah, you could live stream video over it's if you depending on what protocol you're using.

922
00:57:02,322 --> 00:57:11,634
Scott: Yeah, and because the one cable you can use so many protocols even though it's USB C You could use USB 2.0 over USB C USB 3.0 USB 3.2 Thunderbolt.

923
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:23,824
Rym: second We're not gonna go long on this but a part of the value of the USB C cable is that it supports USB 3.1 which is Really fast.

924
00:57:23,864 --> 00:57:28,980
Scott: There are USB 3.1 that you could use with the old USB 3.0 blue A/B cable

925
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:29,722
Rym: But

926
00:57:30,164 --> 00:57:45,188
Scott: you can get USB 3.2 like mega speeds over USB C cables like insane speeds like several gigabits at the point and that's actually a huge difference because Up until now the fastest thing you could really plug into your computer.

927
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:48,316
Scott: That wasn't internal was like something like eSATA.

928
00:57:48,376 --> 00:57:52,735
Scott: maybe right or You know net your network would be one gigabit.

929
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,134
Rym: My last computer had a bunch of eSATA cables and did.

930
00:57:56,174 --> 00:57:57,420
Rym: those were not commonly right?

931
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:04,019
Rym: He said is killed by USB C because he said like SATA is not a resilient protocol for a long cable to connect to.

932
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,904
Scott: no No, but now it's like well if I got a NAS Why would I plug?

933
00:58:08,005 --> 00:58:10,880
Scott: if I got you know external hard drives right in a NAS in a raid?

934
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,680
Scott: Why would I connect them over the network at one gigabit onto my network?

935
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:22,348
Scott: When I could just plug them in directly to my computer with USB C yep, that's way faster than one gigabit.

936
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:27,346
Scott: and then it used the network sharing on my computer if I wanted other computers than the Network to be able to access the.

937
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:29,360
Rym: we talked about this back when we were doing the NAS job.

938
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,740
Rym: They're due to the NAS and a DAS network tech sort attached storage versus disk attached storage or direct attached storage.

939
00:58:36,242 --> 00:58:46,700
Rym: But if you're like using a workstation to edit like giant 8k videos Yeah You plug a giant sand directly into that computer instead of having hard drives in the computer.

940
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:50,900
Scott: So the final thing that I want to say about USB C that's so great having this one cable.

941
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,797
Scott: Is that all of the things around the cable are?

942
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:58,773
Scott: Super super standardized to even right now more than you would realize.

943
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:11,080
Scott: for example, I bought a little thing yeah, and on one end of it was USB C and on the other end was Female USB C so that you could get some charging power to whatever device you were playing this into right?

944
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,126
Scott: USB 3 B the square shape.

945
00:59:14,668 --> 00:59:18,800
Scott: so that's like a little hub in case you wanted to plug something else in and an HDMI port.

946
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:23,540
Scott: So what you would use this for would be you would plug the USB C end into your iPad.

947
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:27,320
Scott: You would then connect another USB C cable to keep your iPad charging.

948
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:34,479
Scott: You could then maybe plug in like a USB mouse or keyboard into your iPad or something like that on the USB C You know B hole, right?

949
00:59:35,069 --> 00:59:39,534
Scott: and Then you can plug in HDMI cable to get HDMI output from the iPad.

950
00:59:39,554 --> 00:59:47,160
Scott: and now you're using like your iPad Connected to an external monitor or a TV or you're streaming what it's showing on your iPad or something like that.

951
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:47,441
Scott: Now the

952
00:59:47,502 --> 01:00:04,300
Rym: original USB spec the old one handled this kinda yeah, but it was called USB on the go and because of the direction of the cables and everything the end result was if You weren't extremely careful about what you plugged in and how you plugged it in stuff would just get fried.

953
01:00:04,421 --> 01:00:07,480
Scott: But anyway, I bought this little adapter like about 15 bucks.

954
01:00:07,782 --> 01:00:09,372
Scott: Oh, and it lets me do all that stuff.

955
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:10,540
Scott: plug into the bottom of the iPad.

956
01:00:11,163 --> 01:00:18,514
Scott: I also have a Nintendo switch and sometimes you don't want to carry your switch dock around with you But I take the same exact adapter.

957
01:00:18,534 --> 01:00:19,920
Scott: I didn't buy another different adapter.

958
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:29,686
Scott: I plug the USB C into the bottom of the Nintendo switch and then I can plug my you know use actually to charge a Switch pro controller.

959
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:33,260
Scott: the cable they give you is USB B on one end and C on the other end.

960
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:40,349
Scott: Yeah, you plug that in and you can now charge your Nintendo A on one ends not B.

961
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:43,099
Rym: Nothing uses a and it doesn't use this B anymore.

962
01:00:44,202 --> 01:00:46,152
Scott: Anyway, it's the rights of the regular old rectangle.

963
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:47,359
Scott: That's a that's the a1.

964
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:48,646
Scott: It was the big one.

965
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:51,340
Rym: a is the big normal one anyway.

966
01:00:53,030 --> 01:01:00,480
Scott: so Then you plug an HDMI cable to get the video out from your switch to your TV Because you don't want to carry a switch dock, right?

967
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:07,640
Scott: The only thing is the switch itself is just annoying and that the switches has a special program.

968
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:18,839
Scott: It's looking specifically for the official legitimate made by Nintendo AC adapter Which is literally just two prongs that go in the wall and USB C on the other end.

969
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:32,065
Scott: Yeah, so you have to bring your you as your official Nintendo AC adapter with you But you plug that USB C and into this adapter to charge your switch while the HDMI is coming out and lo and behold The switch will.

970
01:01:32,086 --> 01:01:33,149
Scott: now happily doesn't?

971
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:36,079
Scott: it will think that that thing is basically your Nintendo switch dock.

972
01:01:36,762 --> 01:01:38,568
Scott: Nintendo switch docks cost a fortune.

973
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:41,980
Scott: this thing costs like 15 20 bucks now and it works with my iPad.

974
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:46,833
Scott: Also, it's the same standard USB C to HDMI the same exact everything and

975
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:54,543
Rym: if you're not trying to play video out of it And use it while you're charged like if you just want to charge it any old like the same thing that charges my phone charges The switch.

976
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:55,548
Scott: Yeah, it's.

977
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,560
Scott: you can actually charge other things with the switch.

978
01:01:57,701 --> 01:02:02,620
Rym: I charged my switch from the the anchor battery I carry with myself.

979
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:07,700
Scott: Yes, it's only when you want your switch to do video out that it demands the official AC adapter.

980
01:02:07,921 --> 01:02:08,504
Scott: Yeah, you.

981
01:02:08,584 --> 01:02:15,860
Scott: otherwise you could just take like your Samsung phone charger That's USB C and plug it into the bottom Nintendo switch and it charges just fine.

982
01:02:16,262 --> 01:02:18,980
Scott: It's like USB C. is that standardized across?

983
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:26,932
Scott: iPad Samsung phone and tend to switch any other thing USB C. You will be shocked at how compatible and how feature right.

984
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:29,540
Scott: a MacBook Pro has USB C on the side.

985
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,760
Scott: You can take the charger for that shove it in the bottom Nintendo switch charging.

986
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:33,382
Scott: It's working

987
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:44,780
Rym: and it's because that all the people involved have done and all the standards bodies and all the manufacturers have done a lot of work to make USB C Just work without you having to know with all the old USB and all the other cables up at this point.

988
01:02:45,122 --> 01:02:48,000
Rym: You had to know things to make weird stuff happen.

989
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:53,310
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna be shocked if soon as you get more and more USB C stuff You're gonna want to throw away every key.

990
01:02:53,411 --> 01:02:55,323
Scott: everything you have is not USB C.

991
01:02:55,363 --> 01:02:56,472
Rym: example DisplayPort.

992
01:02:56,774 --> 01:02:57,500
Rym: fuck those cables.

993
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:02,560
Rym: Remember, those are the cables that will literally ruin your video card or monitor if they're made wrong.

994
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,908
Rym: And most of them are made wrong.

995
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:04,249
Rym: Yep.

996
01:03:04,431 --> 01:03:06,060
Rym: The cable itself is a danger.

997
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,066
Rym: USB-c you're pretty much good.

998
01:03:09,287 --> 01:03:12,976
Rym: However, only by name-brand USB cables and HDMI.

999
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:14,500
Scott: It's like one HDMI cable.

1000
01:03:14,882 --> 01:03:16,388
Scott: It's like, you know, not great.

1001
01:03:16,408 --> 01:03:22,188
Scott: Yeah, actually when you start getting into super high-res Situations USB C. It's like boom.

1002
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:24,577
Scott: Let me see that 4k 8k video wall.

1003
01:03:24,597 --> 01:03:26,182
Scott: Let's go Yep.

1004
01:03:26,664 --> 01:03:32,730
Rym: Now there is a little nuance to the cables that I don't really want to get into Know.

1005
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:33,339
Scott: it now.

1006
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:37,358
Scott: Someone else can read it.

1007
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:43,318
Rym: Yeah, I need to read it for them, but it comes down to the fact that the cables have chips in them.

1008
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:49,480
Rym: now Yep, which if you open up like any converter display stuff, there is a lot of logic in cable.

1009
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:49,982
Scott: Yeah, that's thing.

1010
01:03:50,023 --> 01:03:50,927
Scott: I was just talking about this.

1011
01:03:50,947 --> 01:04:04,700
Scott: like USB C to HDMI probably has a whole computer in it Yep, like a processor and everything and RAM, you know, yep, and even though it's 15 $20 USB-c cables may or may not have support for certain like weird advanced function.

1012
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,356
Scott: It's possible that like if you get el cheapo USB C cable that you were using to charge like some.

1013
01:04:09,878 --> 01:04:17,556
Scott: I don't know your Bicycle light which my current bicycle lights right now use micro USB C, but I'm micro USB, but I'm sure in the future They'll be USB C.

1014
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,066
Rym: But here's where it'll matter some.

1015
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:26,760
Scott: some cable that comes with the light that you use to charge your you know You used to charge your bicycle light is probably not gonna work if you try to send 4k video.

1016
01:04:26,981 --> 01:04:28,587
Rym: Here is where it'll matter to you.

1017
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:32,100
Rym: Here's the practical reason why you'll need to know this a little bit.

1018
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:35,348
Rym: USB-c cables can only be about two meters long.

1019
01:04:35,729 --> 01:04:39,300
Rym: Yeah, there are many cases where you want a really really long USB cable.

1020
01:04:39,886 --> 01:04:41,199
Rym: It's not gonna work, right?

1021
01:04:42,222 --> 01:04:51,113
Rym: Usually for video output a really really long USB 3 cable is also not gonna work now Like the one long USB cable I have for that oculus sensor up there.

1022
01:04:51,414 --> 01:04:53,220
Rym: That is like the maximum length.

1023
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,488
Rym: They're gonna be like the light.

1024
01:04:55,508 --> 01:04:58,560
Scott: the length you need is the length to plug it in next to your bed.

1025
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,608
Scott: I'm where your night.

1026
01:04:59,648 --> 01:05:03,680
Scott: your USB thing is by your night I don't know, but here's why I hold your phone in bed while it charges.

1027
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,884
Scott: That's how long you need it to be.

1028
01:05:05,165 --> 01:05:08,377
Rym: USB C cables cannot be more than two meters.

1029
01:05:08,618 --> 01:05:09,260
Scott: Okay, that's wrong.

1030
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:11,145
Scott: Also two meters is pretty long.

1031
01:05:11,345 --> 01:05:17,020
Rym: However, if you you can get USB C cables that are longer.

1032
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:22,760
Rym: There's a. there's a spec accounts for having a really long cable up to four meters.

1033
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:23,850
Rym: He can double the length.

1034
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:24,939
Scott: that is hella long.

1035
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:35,400
Scott: But your if your entertainment system is more than four meters from your TV and your stereo No Whatever it needs to be dams or rearrange your room and all that means is that those?

1036
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:41,880
Rym: USB-c cables will only support USB 2.0 speeds and will not support weird alternate modes.

1037
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:48,337
Rym: So if you use a USB C cable to plug into your des And you use a graph four meter cable.

1038
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:48,839
Rym: It won't work.

1039
01:05:49,161 --> 01:05:52,091
Rym: Yeah, that's that's really the only cable problem.

1040
01:05:52,111 --> 01:05:54,218
Scott: Why is your dad's four meters from your computer?

1041
01:05:54,419 --> 01:05:59,560

Scott: I look forward to the death of every data cable and Powering small devices that have their own batteries.

1043
01:06:06,617 --> 01:06:07,040
Scott: cable.

1044
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:20,121
Scott: Yeah It's not shaped with USB C on both ends because right now Most of the cables I have are actually regularly old USB on one end and USB C on the other because like my anchor Charging hub doesn't have isn't five USB C's it's.

1045
01:06:20,422 --> 01:06:26,219
Rym: yeah, I want to get to the point where I just want to start replacing a lot of like I want to put in all My power outlets are on the house.

01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,264
Scott: Oh, I forgot.

1048
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,360
Scott: you get a cable that's USB C on both ends.

1049
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,490
Scott: Yeah, you'd be shocked what you can do with that.

1050
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,640
Scott: I don't cuz I can plug your devices.

1051
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:36,985

Scott: plug your GoPro into your computer.

1061
01:06:59,761 --> 01:07:12,357
Rym: Boom stuff's happening when you connect that USB C game free USB C cameras if they were serious like big cameras tended to have one USB port to be a host and one to be a connector.

1062
01:07:12,377 --> 01:07:24,125
Scott: obviously your Experience may vary with different shitty or better devices But yeah for the most part if two devices have USB C And there's some logical reason to connect the two and you do so Something's gonna happen when you plug them in.

1063
01:07:24,406 --> 01:07:28,460

01:09:11,624 --> 01:09:23,130

01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:43,149
Rym: before he could make it back to the Batcave Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave and took a naked 47 up from under his hat and blew Batman away.

1082
01:09:43,371 --> 01:09:48,649
Rym: It was right at that time, but he ran out of balls and he ran away because all of this crime came to save the day.

1083
01:09:49,073 --> 01:09:50,345
Rym: This is the ultimate showdown.

1084
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:55,050
Rym: Ultimate destiny could grab bad guys and explosions.

1085
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:59,583

1088
01:10:13,821 --> 01:10:24,339
Rym: Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime And then Shaq came back covered in a tire track But Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back and Batman was injured and trying to get steady.

1089
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:30,540
Rym: when Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete but suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped in the end and took him out with his whips.

Rym: Then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind.

1091
01:10:32,713 --> 01:10:34,864
Rym: then he reached for his son Which he just couldn't find.

1092
01:10:34,884 --> 01:10:45,367
Rym: cuz Batman stole it and he shot and he missed and Jackie Chan deflected it with his fists And he jumped in the air and he did a somersault while Abraham Lincoln tried to pull a fault onto Optimus Prime But they collided in the air.

1093
01:10:45,387 --> 01:10:47,600
Rym: then they both got hit by a Care Bear stare.

1094
01:10:48,022 --> 01:10:49,900
