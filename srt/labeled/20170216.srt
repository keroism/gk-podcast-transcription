00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,846
Rym: It's Thursday, February 16th, 2017.

2
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:14,299
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,380
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,340
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,520
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about lunch.

6
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:22,719
Rym: Scott keeps dropping something back there.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,658
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,998
Rym: So yeah, we're live streaming this one video, because as you guys might know- Because you got nothing better to do?

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,527
Rym: No.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:40,999
Rym: So, well, partly, I've been trying to like set up my live streaming such that if I'm in some game and I want to live stream it, I don't have to do anything.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,960
Rym: So I got like a light and all these cameras, and I like upgraded all the equipment.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,020
Scott: My problem is I always try to get fancy, right?

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,254
Scott: If I do it a PC game, I could just use a webcam, but it's like, no, I want to get my- Dude, this webcam is pretty baller, C920.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,940
Scott: I want to get my real camera going on, right?

15
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:56,740
Rym: Yeah, look at that.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,479
Rym: That looks pretty good, right?

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,012
Scott: If I'm sitting on my couch, I want to get my country man in there with my wireless.

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:11,059
Scott: It's like I keep wanting to hook up more stuff, and that's why it takes a long time to set up, and then- That's why, because I got this all set up already because of the mixer.

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,960
Scott: That doesn't mean that's not going to help, but then the other thing is like- Why?

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,100
Rym: I just plugged the country man in there.

21
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,119
Rym: I could just plug it in.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,620
Rym: It just works.

23
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:23,597
Scott: And then if I set all the stuff up, and it's like, well, I could just leave it that way, but it takes up so much room.

24
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:24,538
Scott: It's a big mess.

25
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:24,825
Scott: Yup.

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,439
Scott: So I take it all apart.

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Rym: So yeah, it's Thursday.

28
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:28,940
Rym: Talk about whatever.

29
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:40,256
Rym: So I was looking at Google, looking for news that might have happened, and I saw Great Wall trending, and I was like, "Wait,

30
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:40,678
Rym: what?".

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,238
Scott: I mean, it's not the Chinese Great Wall, but it is.

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,036
Rym: Yeah, well, sort of.

33
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:50,960
Rym: So there's this movie, if you don't know, that is called The Great Wall.

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,479
Scott: I only know about this because someone sent me the trailer, and I watched it.

35
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,879
Rym: So I saw the trailer before Rogue One, I think.

36
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:57,398
Scott: Oh, I didn't see it then.

37
00:01:57,621 --> 00:01:58,520
Rym: I think I saw it then.

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,320
Rym: I saw it in the theater.

39
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:01,280
Scott: I saw Rogue One on Christmas.

40
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,640
Scott: The trailer for this wasn't out yet.

41
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:09,178
Rym: Well, first, I saw this trailer where the whole crowd is like, "What the fuck is this movie?

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,711
Rym: What is this

43
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:11,058
Rym: about?".

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Rym: Like, at first, we all thought it was based... You know those movies they make from crappy, light teen, young adult fiction novels?

45
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:22,220
Rym: Like I guess Hunger Games was pretty good, actually, even though it was from those.

46
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,120
Rym: But like Maze Runner.

47
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,059
Scott: I didn't watch any Hunger Games.

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Rym: Yeah, the movies were pretty good.

49
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,880
Rym: But like Maze Runner, those kind of level.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:40,740
Rym: I thought it was going to be like that, but then it seemed weirder and weirder, and then we used power suits, and at the very end of the trailer, the logo came up, and we figured it out, and it was literally like a dark and gritty Power Rangers reboot.

51
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:50,520
Scott: I mean, the point of this Great Wall here is it's a movie where white dudes save China from demons on the other side of the Great Wall.

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,618
Rym: That's why they built it.

53
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,359
Scott: So if you are... It's like an alternate history where they built the Great Wall to stop demons instead of Mongolians.

54
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:59,539
Scott: I don't know if they're trying to say Mongolians are demons.

55
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:00,879
Scott: I like Mongolia.

56
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:01,620
Scott: It's pretty cool.

57
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:07,958
Scott: But anyway, so if you're a normal person, this seems like a cool idea.

58
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:08,580
Scott: that's original.

59
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:19,040
Scott: But if you're a nerd, a real nerd who knows real nerd things, you'll know that this is L5R, the Legend of the Five Rings, or it was a giant wall, which was the Great Wall, basically.

60
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,417
Rym: Even though that game was mostly like Japanese-esque.

61
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:29,459
Scott: It was everything that was stereotypically Asian samurai kung fu, etc.

62
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,039
Scott: My honor.

63
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:31,632
Scott: Right.

64
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:47,500
Scott: And on the other side of the wall was literal hell, which is not only a trope you see in L5R and, I guess, this movie, but also even in things like Wheel of Time, where if you go too far north, it's awful, right?

65
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,560
Scott: It's like, don't cross this line, this bad stuff on the other side.

66
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:52,056
Rym: I remember we were playing that L5R game.

67
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:55,897
Scott: We're the clan that defends the good part of the clan.

68
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:01,560
Scott: But I mean, in Wheel of Time, it was the people who lived in the northeast, right?

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,400
Scott: They defended the rest of the land or the society from the evil demon stuff that lives on the other side of their castle or whatever.

70
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,140
Rym: They're just next to Mordor.

71
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,260
Scott: Mordor is the same thing, there's a big giant wall and the bad guys are on the other side of it, right?

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,920
Rym: Of course, the bad guys are kind of also defending that wall, like it's kind of, anyway.

73
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:26,159
Scott: Right, but anyway, this is just another one of those, there's a wall with bad guys on the other side.

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:38,639
Rym: But even the styling, like the way they draw the armor and this color style and all the weird color grading they're doing, it even looks like L5R art, like the legit art in the role-playing system and such.

75
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:50,980
Rym: But yeah, as far as I can tell, this movie is just white dude appropriation times a billion and I can't imagine wanting to actually see this movie.

76
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,560
Rym: And even worse, when I saw the trailer in the theater, the CG actually looked bad.

77
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:12,020
Scott: So I read a story somewhere that's like, people watch the trailer and saw some extra awful CGs in it and they pulled the trailer and put out a different one or something because it was like- I wonder if I saw that one.

78
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,480
Scott: Someone did some lazy action in the trailer, right?

79
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:15,918
Scott: You know, a little rush job.

80
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,359
Rym: Oh, this is a savage review of this thing.

81
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:18,995
Rym: Savage.

82
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,380
Rym: Outside of the romantic quipping between two characters.

83
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,740
Scott: Oh, this is someone who saw the whole movie?

84
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,960
Rym: The dialogue is aggressively simple.

85
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:31,880
Scott: I mean, it's not summer yet.

86
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,700
Scott: Isn't this a summer blockbuster type thing?

87
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,280
Scott: Why are you putting this shit out in February?

88
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,100
Rym: February blockbuster.

89
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:37,720
Rym: What else is going on in February?

90
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:41,760
Scott: You could put out like, you know, the romantic movie for Valentine's day or whatever.

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,060
Rym: I'm sure that movie also came out.

92
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,739
Rym: What movies are even in the theater right now?

93
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:46,340
Scott: I don't know.

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,440
Scott: Still Star Wars because everyone has.

95
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:49,715
Rym: Let's see.

96
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:51,340
Scott: Just go to Fandango.

97
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,618
Rym: I'm just going to have to see if Google will just tell me.

98
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,320
Rym: Movie times, movie in Manhattan.

99
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:55,980
Rym: All right.

100
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
Scott: Oh, Lego Batman is the big movie right now, actually.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,059
Scott: People said it's pretty good, but I imagine it's just as funny as the- I thought, you know, other people liked- I saw the Lego movie and everyone else loved that, and I was like, man.

102
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,620
Scott: I thought it was okay.

103
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,000
Scott: So I was like, man.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,180
Rym: Why is it auto scrolling?

105
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:11,759
Rym: That's weird.

106
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:15,120
Scott: So if people love Lego Batman- There you go.

107
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,740
Rym: That's like a legit critical movie.

108
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,880
Scott: That's been out for a while though.

109
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:18,320
Scott: That's not new.

110
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,160
Rym: But it's still in the theaters.

111
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:19,710
Scott: Sure.

112
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,440
Rym: Why is this auto scrolling?

113
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,000
Rym: That's weird.

114
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:23,840
Scott: Your mouse is broken.

115
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,230
Scott: Nope.

116
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,780
Rym: It's just this one website.

117
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:26,579
Scott: I don't know.

118
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,380
Rym: Lego Batman Fist Fight.

119
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,180
Scott: Okay.

120
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,940
Scott: I don't know what that is.

121
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,376
Rym: 50 Shades Darker.

122
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:32,873
Scott: Yeah.

123
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:33,240
Scott: Whatever.

124
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,324
Rym: John Wick 2.

125
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:34,557
Rym: Oh yeah.

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,137
Rym: There you go.

127
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:37,420
Rym: Did you ever see John Wick?

128
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:37,816
Rym: Nope.

129
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,832
Rym: John Wick is fantastic, and I highly recommend.

130
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:47,360
Rym: if you're the kind of person who likes the kind of movies that I like, you'll actually really like John.

131
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:49,480
Rym: If you like The Matrix, you'll like John Wick.

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,669
Rym: If you like The Raid- Wait.

133
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,739
Scott: So if you like Blues Brothers, you'll like John Wick?

134
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,420
Rym: Probably.

135
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:56,419
Rym: I think the overlap between the people who like those two movies is pretty good.

136
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,660
Scott: Okay.

137
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,600
Rym: A Dog's Purpose.

138
00:06:59,065 --> 00:06:59,400
Rym: Split.

139
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,560
Rym: Rings.

140
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:03,220
Scott: Is Rings a sequel to The Ring?

141
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:05,638
Rym: Actually, yeah.

142
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,416
Rym: I think it is.

143
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:07,318
Scott: Coming out of the TV.

144
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,099
Rym: First you watch it, then you die.

145
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,104
Rym: Yup.

146
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:10,996
Rym: Yup.

147
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:11,739
Rym: Okay.

148
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:14,919
Rym: It's almost two fucking hours long, too.

149
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:15,524
Scott: Yup.

150
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,044
Rym: Wow.

151
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:17,760
Scott: I mean, it's a horror movie.

152
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,220
Scott: It's cheap to me.

153
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:18,853
Rym: So yeah.

154
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,439
Rym: Don't go see The Great Wall.

155
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:21,700
Rym: Go see John Wick.

156
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,880
Rym: Go see the actual Great Wall.

157
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,440
Scott: That'd be awesome.

158
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:24,037
Scott: I want to go there.

159
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:24,554
Scott: Yeah.

160
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,099
Scott: Actually- Can you ride a bicycle on The Great Wall from end to end?

161
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:29,360
Rym: I won't get to go.

162
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,439
Rym: Not all of it is the part you're thinking of.

163
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:33,920
Rym: Not all of it has that flat part on the top.

164
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:34,640
Scott: Oh, really?

165
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:34,867
Rym: Yeah.

166
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
Rym: Only the most fortified sections do.

167
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,919
Rym: Other sections are basically earthworks.

168
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,489
Scott: Yeah.

169
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:41,919
Rym: Also, they've faked it.

170
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,480
Rym: They've cemented over a lot of the top of it for structural reasons.

171
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,800
Rym: There's a lot of problems with The Great Wall.

172
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,199
Rym: Not looking so good.

173
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:48,833
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,159
Scott: Too many demons attacking.

175
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,140
Rym: Well, I've got ... Oh, I pulled it up on the stream, but I showed it to you.

176
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,938
Rym: I've left it in the other room.

177
00:07:54,681 --> 00:08:01,759
Rym: Funnily enough, because we're talking about The Great Wall, maybe that's why I thought about the movie, I had on my desk a minute ago, and it's currently sitting on my.

178
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:02,559
Rym: This Is Fine dog.

179
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:07,560
Rym: I have an actual piece of the Theodosian Wall from Byzantium.

180
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:09,758
Scott: Well, it didn't last too long, did it?

181
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,340
Rym: That wall lasted a long time.

182
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:12,239
Rym: It's still there.

183
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:12,895
Scott: Uh-huh.

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,480
Scott: It's not ... You can get right through.

185
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,000
Scott: No problem.

186
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,400
Rym: You can climb inside of it.

187
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,257
Rym: You know who's living in it?

188
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:18,260
Rym: Homeless people.

189
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:28,060
Rym: Homeless, dangerous, armed homeless people who threatened me with bodily harm if I did not vacate the inside of the Theodosian Walls.

190
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:29,339
Scott: I guess it's well defended.

191
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:34,279
Rym: So you got any news or anything?

192
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,340
Scott: So this dude, this is gaming news, but whatever, there's plenty of gaming news.

193
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,480
Scott: This dude, he pre-ordered Nintendo Switch, just like me, which is coming in two weeks.

194
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:53,100
Scott: You know, I'm glad I didn't wait in the line at PAX South to play something that's going to be at my house in two weeks, but he just got it in the mail early, randomly, by luck.

195
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,760
Scott: I guess whoever he ordered it from mailed it to him too early.

196
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,919
Scott: They got it in stock and they weren't supposed to ship him.

197
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,718
Rym: Oh, someone messed up.

198
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,620
Rym: Someone might be in trouble.

199
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,479
Scott: Someone fucked up.

200
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,259
Scott: So he got one and he posted a video online of all the menus and stuff, you know.

201
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,258
Scott: So way to go.

202
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:08,740
Scott: Awesome.

203
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,478
Scott: Now we know.

204
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,080
Rym: Did he get games too or just the Switch?

205
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:12,138
Scott: I mean, he didn't.

206
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,399
Scott: The video is not that long.

207
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,660
Scott: It's like I would have been post.

208
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,592
Rym: I would be live streaming 24/7 like I'm here.

209
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,319
Scott: No one else can compete with you.

210
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,490
Scott: Right.

211
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,620
Scott: You would instantly get all the followers on Twitch.

212
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,038
Scott: Like I have the Switch.

213
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:24,520
Scott: I am on the Twitch.

214
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,197
Rym: You know what I do?

215
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:26,139
Rym: I do a let's play.

216
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,840
Rym: I just sit there and be like, guys, what do you want me to do?

217
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,579
Rym: What do you want me to click on?

218
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:28,913
Rym: Let's go.

219
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:29,540
Scott: Right.

220
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,480
Rym: Want to see some settings?

221
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,559
Scott: I get the software update.

222
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,458
Scott: I go to the eShop.

223
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,539
Scott: I buy the games.

224
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,358
Scott: I need to load it up.

225
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Scott: I mean, they might shut down your channel, but it's like I just go for it anyway.

226
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,237
Scott: I'd be like, deal with it.

227
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,897
Rym: It'd be worth it.

228
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:40,419
Scott: I keep switching different YouTubes.

229
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,720
Scott: I'd set up my own streaming.

230
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,560
Rym: You'd be switching?

231
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:43,212
Scott: Yeah.

232
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:50,700
Scott: I'm going to do that, though, once the Switch comes, I'm going to go home and plug it in and stream it up.

233
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,560
Rym: I was going to sit on your couch and join you.

234
00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:01,879
Scott: There shouldn't be that much competition on March 3rd because who else has the technology to do this is going to do it, pre-ordered the Switch on Amazon, et cetera, et cetera.

235
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:05,399
Rym: I would, but I'm actually going to be in London, so I won't be around.

236
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:05,940
Scott: That's a shame.

237
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,545
Rym: Yeah.

238
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:09,340
Rym: I wasn't going to even pre-order the Switch.

239
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,920
Scott: If you live in New York, if you can get to New York City on March 3rd and you want to come play Bowerman.

240
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,840
Rym: Yeah.

241
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:15,978
Scott: Let me know.

242
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:19,679
Rym: I guess the weekend after that was PAX, and then.

243
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:20,559
Scott: Oh, wait.

244
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:21,120
Scott: Wrong convention.

245
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:32,550
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

246
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,529
Rym: You may recall some time ago, I did a thing of the day that was YouTube comment reconstructions.

247
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:39,788
Rym: These are.

248
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:41,730
Scott: Oh, it was like people saying YouTube comments.

249
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:42,347
Scott: You ever seen these?

250
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,590
Scott: I think I'd barely, I half remember this.

251
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,650
Rym: They're artistically done.

252
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,429
Rym: I almost feel like I should play a clip, but they're.

253
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:49,910
Scott: You're good.

254
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:55,270
Rym: So they're artistically done, black and white, like good acting, like really good acting.

255
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,408
Scott: It's like the old guy.

256
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:56,638
Scott: Yeah.

257
00:10:57,251 --> 00:11:02,630
Rym: It's like rest in peace, Nelson Mandela and the other guys just like nodding along.

258
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,690
Rym: You're a good actor and Bruce Almighty.

259
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:09,110
Rym: And then the other guy just like slowly raises his eyebrow and starts looking up at him.

260
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,870
Rym: Like, please, please tell me that you are trolling.

261
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:12,626
Scott: Yes.

262
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:14,310
Rym: So that was a series.

263
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,529
Rym: They did several, many episodes of this.

264
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:18,149
Scott: Why are you reusing an old thing of the day?

265
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,670
Rym: Well, because I won my everything of the day was one of these, like one episode.

266
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:23,390
Scott: And now you think of it as all the rest.

267
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,570
Rym: No, I think of the day is the series finale occurred.

268
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:27,490
Scott: Oh, they're done.

269
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:33,830
Rym: They the final episode is a final episode in every regard.

270
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:50,470
Rym: It is not to spoil, but basically it's the two actors, the main guys sitting in like this garden and they're having a conversation about how like freedom of speech is so important and I can swan like Obama, get out of my emails and trolling people.

271
00:11:51,351 --> 00:12:02,189
Rym: And meanwhile there's a cowboy hunting them down with a wanted poster and the cowboy is slowly like reciting the terms of service of youtube out loud as he stalks them.

272
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,150
Rym: And it is quite a finale.

273
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,410
Rym: This series is must watch youtube.

274
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:13,547
Rym: Like the fact that they only have, they have under a hundred thousand subscribers is kind of sad to me.

275
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,630
Rym: This stuff is like a internet.

276
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,250
Scott: I like how it's dead parrot channel.

277
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,709
Rym: They do a bunch of other stuff too.

278
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,046
Rym: This is just like one thing they did.

279
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:30,328
Scott: All right, so there's some people in Astoria where I live and they made good morning Astoria, which is a parody of, you know, morning shows like the today show or a good morning America or whatever.

280
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:37,950
Scott: But it's, it actually has a little bit of like actual truth in it, but also mostly jokes.

281
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:45,910
Scott: But then there's actually like, once you get towards the end of it, there's like an actual like, you know, musical performance, which is like legit.

282
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:54,190
Scott: And then that's most of the rest of the, the end of the show, but like a pretty good job for, you know, like we could do this, but like not as good as they could.

283
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,349
Rym: No, I was about to say not as good as they could.

284
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:05,850
Scott: So I mean, if you live in Astoria, you'll understand more of this cause it's a lot of neighborhood jokes, but also, you know, some general jokes that anyone would laugh at.

285
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,588
Rym: They're like two full production quality levels above us.

286
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:09,086
Scott: Yeah.

287
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,130
Rym: Cause look like he's still close to the green screen.

288
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,270
Rym: Like you can see the shadowing.

289
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,429
Scott: No, that's actually like a thing they printed out, I think.

290
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,170
Rym: I don't think it's a green screen because I could have whatever it is.

291
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:19,987
Rym: He's too close to it.

292
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,170
Scott: At some point the camera moves and it's like, it looks like they just printed out on a big board or something.

293
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,649
Rym: That's pretty common.

294
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,364
Scott: I don't know.

295
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,410
Rym: But yeah, you can, you can tell he's close to it.

296
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,450
Rym: The thing is we'd have the same problem because they're in, they're just in their apartment.

297
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:40,728
Scott: They're like, you know, and then the musical performance, they literally like take the camera, go down the stairs, go out the front door and the guys are outside with the music right on the sidewalk.

298
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,270
Scott: It's like, it's that, it's that sort of thing, right?

299
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:49,229
Scott: It's like, I got a lot of that like public access vibe plus youtube vibe plus.

300
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:52,462
Rym: no look how much better it looks when they're outside in the sunlight.

301
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:57,366
Scott: plus like an SNL like actual professional improv kind of vibe only has like 600 views.

302
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:06,170
Rym: A story is not exactly the most happening place in, you know, I just feel bad when something that is clearly good is not well known.

303
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:07,609
Scott: It's going to get some more views now.

304
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,141
Rym: I hope so.

305
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:14,690
Rym: All, all, all 11 of, whoa, there's a lot of people watching the street, all five listeners who know about his story.

306
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,189
Rym: There are 11 people watching this live for some reason.

307
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:18,027
Rym: Eleven people.

308
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,070
Scott: They don't watch me when I play a stream video game and 11 people don't come.

309
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,130
Rym: I get, I've gotten as many as 30 watching me play overwatch, which I don't know why.

310
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:26,909
Rym: I don't comment.

311
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,070
Rym: I just kind of sit there staring sullenly at the screen as I lose over and over again.

312
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,505
Scott: I keep trying to comment cause I know it's boring as hell when I'm sitting there doing nothing and I'm not getting it.

313
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,550
Rym: What's up gamers?

314
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,927
Rym: Welcome to my Minecraft stream.

315
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:38,949
Scott: Not like that.

316
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,670
Scott: I usually try to like talk about like the design of the game.

317
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,110
Scott: Like, Oh look, this part of the game is poorly designed.

318
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,050
Scott: Oh look, this part of the game is well designed.

319
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,770
Scott: And if I know about the game, I'll be like, Oh, you know, like I know about this game.

320
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,908
Scott: Let me tell you what I know.

321
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,278
Scott: Yeah.

322
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:52,950
Rym: The problem is that requires the game.

323
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,205
Rym: I know.

324
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,689
Rym: Like I was saying, if I do sieve five.

325
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,100
Rym: Yeah.

326
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,430
Rym: Like I can talk forever.

327
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,449
Rym: Like here is exactly how this mechanic works out of us.

328
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,899
Rym: But if it's sieve six, I'm like, I guess I'll build a Hansa.

329
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:09,629
Rym: cause I guess I just sit there like reading text on the screen for five minutes.

330
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:11,129
Rym: That's fine.

331
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:11,809
Rym: This has got seven.

332
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:12,801
Rym: I'm giving this it's 18th.

333
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,888
Rym: Like here we go.

334
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,842
Scott: You didn't even watch it.

335
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,406
Rym: Yeah.

336
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:17,849
Rym: I'm confident in it.

337
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:18,210
Rym: Okay.

338
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,068
Rym: I am confident in it based on what I saw here.

339
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:23,685
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book is Dune.

340
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:25,689
Rym: The Dune.

341
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,113
Rym: D-U-N-E.

342
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:28,010
Scott: We're doing it.

343
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:28,810
Scott: Not the video game Dune.

344
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,909
Scott: Not the movie Dune.

345
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,707
Scott: The book Dune.

346
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:30,963
Rym: Yup.

347
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,950
Rym: Not the board game Dune.

348
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,650
Scott: And not any of those other Dune books.

349
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:35,069
Scott: Only the original first one.

350
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:35,381
Rym: Yup.

351
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:38,290
Rym: Because I've never read the whole thing.

352
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,027
Scott: It's by Frank.

353
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:39,589
Scott: How you been?

354
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:46,370
Rym: I know a lot about Dune, but I'm really interested to see one, how many nerd references do I miss?

355
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:59,123
Rym: because I don't realize they're from Dune to, uh, is the book at, will the book grab me with my adult sensibilities in a way that it did not when I was younger, middle school Scott could not get past much of Dune, but three more important.

356
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:04,630
Rym: will my like exposure to things like the Prince of nothing make its density feel sparse.

357
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,150
Scott: Well, I mean, look, you know, wheel of time was another famous nerd thing.

358
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,787
Scott: Not quite as famous as Dune, but out there, uh, a lot of stuff.

359
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:13,430
Rym: Like now I know the Heron.

360
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,129
Rym: Like I learned the Heron blade is from that Heron spear is better.

361
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,409
Rym: Heron spear is better.

362
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:18,785
Scott: Herons.

363
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:26,309
Scott: I mean, Heron anything is like, if I ever make a game that has like equipment in it or something, the Heron, whatever is like the highest level of stuff.

364
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,409
Rym: The problem with the Heron's blade was that it kind of Peters out and there's way bigger stuff later.

365
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:36,716
Rym: Like they work it up so much and it's like, oh yeah, everybody, you meet like 20 people who have them, but the Heron

366
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:36,836
Scott: spear

367
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:41,827
Rym: was used once in before the books and I feel

368
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:42,248
Scott: like it

369
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:46,208
Rym: being used again is going to be the end of the Prince of

370
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:46,470
Scott: nothing.

371
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,350
Scott: I mean, like, look, like King Arthur is like, you got like Excalibur, right?

372
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:53,910
Scott: And it's like, first of all, there is nothing better than Excalibur lying around anywhere.

373
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,260
Scott: Yeah.

374
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:54,706
Scott: Right.

375
00:16:55,211 --> 00:17:02,685
Scott: What about, well, yeah, the only thing wrong with Excalibur is like, he gets it right a fucking way from the lady of the lake and then he's always got it.

376
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,109
Scott: and that's pretty much it.

377
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,263
Scott: It should be like, they should tease you with the legend of Excalibur, like, you know, it's out there.

378
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:09,329
Scott: It's a Chekhov's gun.

379
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,569
Scott: Someone's going to get it at some point, but don't get it until the end.

380
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:13,007
Rym: Oh, no.

381
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,750
Rym: So, oh, he's got Excalibur.

382
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:15,130
Rym: Great.

383
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,329
Rym: Now I got to go find the Holy grail.

384
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,290
Rym: That's way more important.

385
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,669
Scott: They spend the whole fucking book on the Holy grail.

386
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,143
Rym: I'm thinking about the movie once.

387
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:24,909
Scott: a future King is the real deal.

388
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,888
Scott: All others are not the real deal.

389
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,928
Rym: He should have stayed with the geese.

390
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:30,869
Rym: That was a way better life.

391
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,569
Scott: I also would have stayed with the geese.

392
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:33,975
Scott: Yup.

393
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,530
Rym: That goose girl shitting on everybody.

394
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,650
Rym: Hanging out with the goose girl.

395
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:40,250
Scott: Making a big racket.

396
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,389
Scott: They didn't even guns then.

397
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,410
Scott: So what are you going to do about it?

398
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,190
Rym: Also like geese got culture.

399
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,990
Rym: Like they're talking about like visiting their aunts and uncles and all their like dinner parties and nonsense.

400
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,750
Rym: Like I remember the geese have a surprisingly modern culture.

401
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:57,069
Scott: Also, you know, uh, Merlin pretty much like, you know, Merlin backwards.

402
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,670
Rym: I feel like living backwards is not the best way to live.

403
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:01,358
Rym: It is.

404
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:04,750
Rym: So yes, the previous book club was Rebecca.

405
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:06,569
Rym: The episodes up.

406
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,869
Rym: You should read that book.

407
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,828
Rym: If you didn't read it, you should also watch that movie if you've never seen it.

408
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:17,530
Rym: And then you should listen to our review where, uh, if you want late crit, go somewhere else because other people have done that way better.

409
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:20,010
Rym: We just talk about the book from our own perspective.

410
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:30,870
Rym: Uh, we're going to be live at PAX East 2017 doing a panel called play dirty to win on Friday at 6pm in the bumblebee theater.

411
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:31,807
Scott: Such Phil.

412
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,790
Rym: I've been doing some, uh, research for this panel.

413
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,050
Rym: Like a lot more than usual.

414
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:37,769
Scott: I think it reeks of effort.

415
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:38,949
Rym: It does.

416
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,089
Rym: The slides are looking good.

417
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:44,930
Rym: Uh, I learned a lot about formal heuristics and uh, I got some stuff.

418
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,270
Rym: The gaze heuristic is the tip of the iceberg.

419
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:47,829
Scott: Nobody cares.

420
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,330
Rym: Fast and frugal failure of heuristics is the order of the day.

421
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:58,390
Rym: Uh, so, uh, I guess we never talked about lunch.

422
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:00,930
Scott: Also known as crab people ideas.

423
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,550
Scott: We got nothing else to talk about on Thursday.

424
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,745
Scott: Send your Thursday show ideas that anything that in the world that's not that we a haven't done.

425
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:19,310
Rym: B is not technology, is not games, is not comics, anime, manga, reviewing things you haven't seen, general protest packs versus board game geek convention.

426
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:21,260
Scott: That's just like news.

427
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,570
Scott: that's not even tennis.

428
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,669
Rym: How tennis is awesome.

429
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:26,109
Rym: That's gaming, but that would be a good Tuesday show.

430
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:26,730
Rym: Sure.

431
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:35,807
Rym: Like we're talking about why tennis is what, like a nearly perfect sport or a perfect game at least Thursday ideas Thursday.

432
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:41,190
Rym: The day that could be literally anything is the hardest goddamn day.

433
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:41,500
Scott: Sure.

434
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:42,529
Rym: Well I guess.

435
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:46,249
Rym: So I suggested we do lunch and Scott said, I feel like we already did it.

436
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,090
Rym: Uh, not only have we not done lunch, but we have not even done brunch.

437
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:51,650
Scott: I'm pretty sure we have.

438
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:51,863
Rym: Nope.

439
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,710
Rym: In fact, the only, if I search for lunch, I find one punch man.

440
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,946
Rym: That's an a bunch of dwarves and Mike Tyson's punch out.

441
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,150
Scott: the hell is a bunch of dwarves.

442
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,567
Rym: I'm going to find out to that and GeekNights burning dwarf.

443
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:10,930
Rym: Oh, we talk about, remember when you ran that burning door fortress game?

444
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:11,810
Scott: That was a good game.

445
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,317
Rym: We just tell the story of that.

446
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,330
Scott: and why did we do a show like that and something so shitty?

447
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:19,789
Rym: and then we used it as a segue into remember project Dorf.

448
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:22,529
Scott: Yeah, I didn't go anywhere either.

449
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:23,068
Rym: I hear it.

450
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,758
Rym: Get hub.com.

451
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:25,330
Rym: A fresh.

452
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:33,823
Scott: There isn't even really, I mean that's probably still there, but it never got to the point of code that ran, I think seven years ago.

453
00:20:33,843 --> 00:20:36,567
Rym: you added some basic documentation, fixed a color bug.

454
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:38,510
Scott: Uh, does it even do anything?

455
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,528
Rym: Oh no, you didn't.

456
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,209
Rym: Lack of cheese made the last updates.

457
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,399
Rym: This is a may 6th, 2010.

458
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:45,530
Scott: does it even run or do anything?

459
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,148
Rym: I know there's all this stuff in here.

460
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:47,641
Scott: Sure.

461
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,769
Rym: It's just python.

462
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,040
Rym: I can, I should, I should go like, should.

463
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,649
Rym: you guys should download this repo and like run stuff and see what happens.

464
00:20:57,515 --> 00:20:58,330
Rym: Here's random movers.

465
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,390
Rym: Here's some python code.

466
00:20:59,453 --> 00:20:59,539
Rym: Yeah.

467
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,789
Rym: Here's a random mover.

468
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,227
Scott: I can't imagine anything will happen.

469
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:06,470
Rym: Any random mover, a mover that moves randomly between adjacent nodes.

470
00:21:06,678 --> 00:21:06,890
Rym: Mine.

471
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,841
Scott: Mine.

472
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:09,588
Scott: Good times.

473
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:15,932
Rym: Anyway, so I feel like lunch is an okay show because lunch is the forced meal where you don't, like.

474
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:22,790
Rym: I feel like lunch is the meal you have the least day to day control over where like what you eat because you're always at work or something.

475
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,789
Rym: Like you're very limited.

476
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,170
Rym: You're not going to go far.

477
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,628
Scott: I think it's the most important meal.

478
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:27,039
Scott: Yeah.

479
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:28,210
Rym: Cause I can skip breakfast.

480
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:28,826
Rym: I usually do.

481
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:35,269
Scott: It's like, you know, even if you eat a breakfast, it only gets you so far, you know, through the day before you lose an energy.

482
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:37,550
Scott: And then it's like, you got to rest of the day.

483
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,510
Scott: You got to make it through.

484
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:39,689
Scott: You must eat a lunch.

485
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:49,230
Scott: It's like, you can even skip a breakfast and just sort of get to lunch and you could like, you know, you can skip dinner and go to bed, but you, you can't skip lunch.

486
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:53,688
Scott: It's like, it's like you won't, you'll just fall asleep in the afternoon if you don't eat lunch.

487
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:58,734
Rym: So for one, I have a philosophy on lunch and I decided this, you know, back when I did not have a lot of money

488
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:00,340
Scott: thinking too hard about life here,

489
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:10,530
Rym: lunch, lunch can be cheap or it can be expensive, but I made a conscious decision back when I was working at IBM, even, and you know, I didn't have a lot of money.

490
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,610
Rym: I didn't make that much money back.

491
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:23,781
Rym: I felt like I was making a lot of money till I realized I was not, but I made this very conscious decision to always have a great hot lunch or at least a great lunch every day.

492
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:28,165
Rym: And I decided back then I was willing to spend up to $15 a day.

493
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:30,690
Scott: It's a lot of money.

494
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,730
Rym: It was a lot of money.

495
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:32,670
Rym: Like I thought about that.

496
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,460
Scott: I save a lot of money by just like making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and not paying $15 every day.

497
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,150
Rym: So for a while I tried to go cheap and I can buy expensive stuff.

498
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,270
Rym: I would make lunches.

499
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,170
Rym: I would eat like pizza cause I was where my office was in, uh, basically Yonkers.

500
00:22:48,510 --> 00:23:00,150
Scott: So if you take the money that I do not spend on alcohol, coffee and expensive lunch every day, only some days, why live?

501
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:04,289
Scott: Because then I could spend that money on luxurious items, which I do.

502
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:06,856
Rym: But I may, I re.

503
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:11,148
Rym: I thought about this real hard cause I was eating these kinds of crappy lunches and just saved my money.

504
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:31,190
Rym: But when I worked at IBM, the culinary Institute, basically like their students ran a cafeteria on the campus and you could get cheap food there, but you could spend about 1395. give or take and get like a legit amazing lunch, like a big one, like this giant ass gumbo.

505
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:32,810
Rym: It was always something fancy.

506
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,848
Rym: It was different every day.

507
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:47,470
Rym: And I thought long and hard and I decided that adding up $15 a day over the course of my life, five days a week, the sheer joy that that gave me, the good feelings, that sense of comfort and food was worth that money.

508
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,130
Rym: I was willing to spend that money.

509
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:57,236
Rym: Like if it were a monthly subscription that guaranteed five meals like that every week for the rest of my life, as long as I kept paying that monthly fee, I would have paid it.

510
00:23:58,432 --> 00:24:00,610
Rym: And I've continued that philosophy to this day.

511
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,409
Rym: I have a great lunch no matter what.

512
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:03,769
Scott: All right.

513
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:04,993
Scott: I save money.

514
00:24:05,014 --> 00:24:08,670
Scott: and I mean, thing is peanut butter and jelly is not a bad lunch.

515
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:15,408
Scott: I get a fancy jelly, which costs like $5 for a jar that lasts like a whole week, a loaf of bread.

516
00:24:15,611 --> 00:24:17,710
Scott: That's like $3 that lasts a whole week.

517
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:18,990
Scott: So it's $8.

518
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:25,988
Scott: And then bulk at bulk, amazing peanut butter from Amazon is like more money, but that lasts you like months.

519
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,869
Scott: So it could last you like peanut butter or crunchy, whatever you feel like.

520
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:30,563
Rym: You don't care.

521
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,409
Scott: I mean, preference is really not a such thing as bad peanut butter except for Peter Pan brand, which tastes disgusting.

522
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:35,646
Scott: Yeah.

523
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:39,390
Rym: Any peanut butter that tastes like edible oil from a non peanut.

524
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,662
Scott: But like Jiff, Skippy, even those are.

525
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,030
Scott: even those are mass brands.

526
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,687
Scott: They taste good.

527
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,248
Scott: Fine.

528
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,949
Scott: Peter Pan is just the one that tastes bad.

529
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,270
Rym: The grocery store by my office has the dump peanuts in a thing and grind your own peanut butter.

530
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:52,890
Scott: I mean, a secret.

531
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:57,586
Scott: If you go to Publix Supermarket, which is in Florida, it's like the stop and shop of Florida.

532
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:04,370
Scott: If you go to the deli counter where you get meats, they will actually have peanut butter back there that you can get by the pound.

533
00:25:04,531 --> 00:25:06,369
Scott: And that is like incredible peanut butter.

534
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:07,389
Scott: It's secret.

535
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:08,690
Scott: Anyway.

536
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,410
Rym: So what do you have for lunch on a daily on an average day?

537
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:12,349
Scott: Usually peanut bun.

538
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:13,830
Scott: I make two sandwiches.

539
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,230
Scott: I just make them at my desk and it costs almost nothing.

540
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,570
Scott: Oh, yes.

541
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,410
Rym: You leave the components at work and make the lunch there.

542
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:20,790
Rym: Yes.

543
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,450
Scott: The grocery store is right next to work.

544
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,050
Scott: I'll just walk when the bread runs out.

545
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,209
Scott: I walk over and buy a bread.

546
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,210
Rym: I never did that for lunch, but I did that for snacks.

547
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,128
Rym: Like I would go to the grocery store and buy like all these snacks and just like stock my office with them.

548
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:31,470
Rym: Yeah.

549
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,550
Scott: We have a. we have a mini fridge just for our department.

550
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,182
Scott: I load it up.

551
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:37,750
Scott: Oh, but I mean, that's not I don't do it every single day.

552
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:42,849
Scott: For example, you know, let's say I run out of bread and Pax is three days from now.

553
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:43,950
Rym: I'm not going to buy more.

554
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,369
Scott: Why would I buy a loaf of bread that I'm only going to eat half of and then we'll be stale when I get back from Pax.

555
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:54,248
Scott: I just going to eat out three times, you know, and what I eat out is I don't eat the same thing two days in a row.

556
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:56,570
Rym: You have that weird upset.

557
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,330
Rym: You'll do that a restaurant.

558
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,630
Rym: So you're like, I had Mexican food yesterday, so I can't have it today.

559
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:01,128
Scott: That's right.

560
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,850
Rym: That's crazy.

561
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,610
Scott: It's not crazy.

562
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:03,910
Rym: But what if that food is good?

563
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:07,349
Scott: So right next to my office, same food two days in a row.

564
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:13,687
Rym: So right near my office is Takahachi Bakery, which is like a legit Japanese style, like Tokyo Street Bakery.

565
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,430
Rym: They have great, like simple lunches.

566
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:18,970
Rym: I will eat there three times a week.

567
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,289
Scott: I mean, I'll eat at the same place.

568
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,390
Scott: I just won't get the same thing.

569
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,030
Scott: Like as a place near me, I go, they got this really good pasta.

570
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:25,669
Scott: You can get there.

571
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:30,890
Rym: So you can have enchiladas for lunch on Wednesday and then you could have like a chimichangas on Thursday and that's okay.

572
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,989
Scott: Are they different enough?

573
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,910
Rym: Chimichanga versus enchilada.

574
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,050
Scott: Yeah, I guess it's different enough.

575
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:35,590
Rym: All right.

576
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:35,930
Rym: All right.

577
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:38,410
Rym: What about soft tacos versus hard tacos?

578
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,710
Scott: It's not really different enough.

579
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,849
Rym: What about soft tacos versus enchiladas?

580
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:44,709
Scott: Depends.

581
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,450
Scott: I mean, I definitely wouldn't get the same filling.

582
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,890
Rym: How different do the toppings on a pizza have to be to count as different?

583
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,230
Scott: I mean, pizza is pizza.

584
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,729
Scott: You got only pizza two days in a row.

585
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:54,869
Rym: There is a really good pizza place by my office, too.

586
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:55,170
Scott: Right.

587
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,990
Rym: Well, I mean, it's one of the like a hundred places called little Italy, but it's actually we got all kinds of like everything.

588
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,310
Scott: We don't have amazing places near me, but we have like these everything places.

589
00:27:03,431 --> 00:27:05,120
Scott: But the thing is the everything place.

590
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:07,010
Scott: like you can go there and get a pizza.

591
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,810
Scott: That's a one person pizza with anything you want and they make it in like this brick oven and everything.

592
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,449
Scott: And it's like, even though it's an everything place is way good.

593
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:15,890
Rym: Yeah.

594
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,269
Rym: Amish market is kind of like that, too.

595
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,170
Rym: Like they have like this giant like counters, get stuff from.

596
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:25,590
Scott: But like their sandwiches and stuff are legit like there's all these everything places, which is like the default lunch in New York City.

597
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,369
Scott: And I got tons to choose from, but some of them are good.

598
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:29,429
Scott: So whatever.

599
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,790
Scott: Just because you're just because they're serving every it's like a cat.

600
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,170
Scott: It's like a cafeteria, basically.

601
00:27:33,274 --> 00:27:33,709
Scott: But it's not.

602
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,490
Scott: It's a public cafe place.

603
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:43,930
Rym: The problem is when they're like the good ones are like, I'd say a third of them are the good ones, but the rest are like not ideal food to eat.

604
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:52,469
Scott: The other thing is that one by Grand Central, there are actually tons of amazing lunch places that you can for real cheap, even in tourist town where I am.

605
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:54,888
Scott: But you got to sit down.

606
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:55,670
Rym: Yeah.

607
00:27:55,851 --> 00:28:00,789
Scott: And even though it'll be way cheap, but it's like, do you have time to sit down and get this way cheap, amazing lunch?

608
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:07,050
Rym: I will make time a lot of times because I'll work and I'll be working and then when it's lunchtime, like I'll just go away for an hour or so and like sit down with the book.

609
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:16,129
Scott: The other thing is that a lot of places that aren't, they don't have like, you know, they're not designed to walk up and take food away, but you still can.

610
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:20,390
Scott: So like there's like a sit down, there's like a noodle place like Kung Fu something.

611
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:27,549
Scott: It's always way crowded with a line out the door, but I'll just walk in and instead of saying like, can I get a seat, I'll just be like, hey, I want this.

612
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:32,108
Scott: And then I wait outside and then when it's done, they come out and hand it to me in a bag and I go back to work.

613
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:40,330
Scott: And it's like, I didn't have to wait, you know, forever and you know, people are still waiting to get a seat, but it's like, I got this sit down food, you know, see, I got time.

614
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,190
Rym: The problem is most of the places I like to eat lunch, they often have seating.

615
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,649
Rym: So like you can take away or sit down, but the sit down is a hundred percent full.

616
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:53,970
Rym: unless I eat at 11, maybe 1130, which luckily I usually don't eat breakfast.

617
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:55,770
Scott: I'm hungry at 11 or 1130.

618
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,508
Rym: I eat lunch at 11 almost every day, like 1115 I start getting hangry and by 1130 I'm dead.

619
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:07,940
Scott: If I get a, if I eat a bagel or English muffin, then I won't get hungry till like noon, but if I don't eat breakfast, I just like, you know,

620
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,986
Rym: unless I bike to work, then I'm desperately hungry immediately when I sit down and I'm also hungry at 11

621
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,268
Scott: I'll get bagel on the way to work.

622
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:15,907
Scott: So it doesn't happen.

623
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,301
Rym: Yeah.

624
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:16,970
Rym: I don't do that.

625
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:24,146
Scott: If I bike, well, I'd get a bagel and then bike now I'll buy first and get a bagel from a street car.

626
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:26,190
Rym: Actually, you know, it's a pretty good breakfast.

627
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,230
Rym: Not that we can't talk about breakfast is the, uh, the breakfast sandwich is Starbucks.

628
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:31,590
Rym: Like actually not that bad.

629
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:36,829
Rym: No, it's like, it's, it's pretty like, it's not that different from what you get at one of those everything places.

630
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:37,608
Rym: No.

631
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:38,906
Scott: No.

632
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:41,809
Rym: So, uh, are there any good places?

633
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:43,270
Rym: Like where do you go when you want a good lunch?

634
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,127
Scott: Good lunch.

635
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,030
Scott: There isn't a lot of good lunch near me.

636
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,089
Scott: I'm in the touristy area.

637
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,970
Rym: There's a, there's, you know, there's the, which is like fancy burgers.

638
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,710
Rym: I got shippers, which is also burgers.

639
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,550
Scott: There is a shippers I go to, but I go there so rarely.

640
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:56,846
Rym: Yeah.

641
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:58,870
Rym: I, my rule is I cannot go there.

642
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,530
Scott: What am I going to shippers every day?

643
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:05,470
Rym: What the hell am I going to be like 300 pounds milkshake and a burger and some onion rings.

644
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:07,208
Scott: There's a Chinese place I can go.

645
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,510
Scott: That's like, you know, it's sort of like, um, something famous, whatever.

646
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:18,133
Scott: And all the Chinese people go there and you wait in a line and then you choose like three things and they put it in the plastic thing, you know, and there's different things every day.

647
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:38,927
Scott: You know, there's a, there's a, there's a sort of higher level, more expensive, fancier everything place where you can get like, you know, even more of everything, but they got like sushi or Korean foods and like the, if they make you pasta, it's like almost like fancy restaurant pasta, but they charge as much as the sit down restaurant would for a pasta dish.

648
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:40,670
Scott: So it's like, what's the point?

649
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:46,189
Rym: I could have just like, I have my coworkers like they, they, they go, like they order together and they go to Sophie's like a lot.

650
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:48,030
Rym: I do not like that place.

651
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:48,486
Scott: What is it?

652
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:58,249
Rym: It's a chain of Cuban food ostensibly, but it feels and tastes, you know, those places that are ostensibly one kind of food, but they're really just a Chinese place.

653
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:10,005
Rym: Like Americana style Chinese food cooking, like oily, like it's Chinese restaurant sharing kitchen with thing that is not Chinese restaurant, but cook kind of the same way, kind of tastes like that.

654
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:12,350
Rym: And it's kind of cheap and not that good.

655
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:18,082
Rym: And the meat's kind of bad because I had a coworker before who always wanted to get the Papa John's.

656
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:19,168
Rym: Oh my God.

657
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,590
Scott: Like you wanted it so much that hopefully, hopefully he'll get half off tomorrow.

658
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:24,509
Rym: He'd be like, so yeah, guys.

659
00:31:24,873 --> 00:31:26,026
Rym: You want in on Papa John's?

660
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:33,847
Rym: And if people weren't into it, he would offer to pay for everyone just so we'd have an excuse to order his Papa John's.

661
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,030
Scott: Why don't you get good pizza with the fuck?

662
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:37,210
Rym: He doesn't work here.

663
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,050
Rym: He doesn't work there anymore.

664
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:38,887
Scott: New York city.

665
00:31:39,152 --> 00:31:39,548
Scott: What the hell?

666
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,889
Scott: Even a Papa.

667
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:41,690
Scott: John's is in business.

668
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,289
Scott: We keeping it in business all by himself.

669
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,570
Rym: Maybe him and the Rangers.

670
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,047
Scott: Why does he love it so much?

671
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,050
Scott: The Rangers don't help them in business.

672
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:49,846
Scott: They put them out of business.

673
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,489
Rym: I wonder if they have insurance on that.

674
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,929
Rym: Like every time that happens, like they get pretty sure.

675
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:58,689
Scott: Even with the discount, uh, that you're, they're still making money on those pizzas.

676
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:02,090
Rym: Well, they have to be, those pizzas can't cost more than a nickel to make every.

677
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,750
Scott: I've never seen someone who actually was going to order it.

678
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,447
Scott: Everyone just jokes about ordering it.

679
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:08,270
Scott: So I can't imagine.

680
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,390
Scott: I don't think anyone even buys the pizza at the discount.

681
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,457
Scott: They're probably the day after.

682
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,250
Scott: they're probably just selling all the pieces at normal price.

683
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:14,249
Scott: No one's using that code.

684
00:32:14,456 --> 00:32:14,709
Rym: Yeah.

685
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:15,310
Rym: Right.

686
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:23,088
Rym: Or you imagine there's some furtive Rangers fans, like they put on an Islander's Jersey and kind of like sunglasses and sneak in and order some Papa John's.

687
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:28,149
Scott: You just order online and you use the code and you get it, but you have to be in the area.

688
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,110
Scott: You can't do this at like, you can't order it at a Papa John's in California.

689
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:32,610
Scott: Won't work.

690
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,130
Rym: Papa John's had a time and a place.

691
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,090
Scott: Also isn't the guy Papa John like a shithead?

692
00:32:36,593 --> 00:32:37,490
Scott: I've heard he's a bad dude.

693
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,488
Rym: I have heard that too, but I don't know for sure.

694
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,470
Rym: What is it with pizza places and bad people?

695
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,390
Rym: Cause you also got, uh, Godfather's also bad.

696
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:47,386
Scott: Anyway.

697
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:47,940
Rym: Yeah.

698
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:57,150
Rym: But, uh, there was a place and a time for Papa John's and that was if you needed pizza after midnight and you don't live in a real city, remember RIT, they delivered till what?

699
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,334
Rym: 2 AM.

700
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,790
Scott: So the best is if you're on a trip, you can get like a super luxurious lunch.

701
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:12,870
Scott: That's when you like, when you go to packs or something like, but sometimes when you're on a trip, you can't get luxurious lunch and you end up getting like concession stand lunch to hold you over for luxurious.

702
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:13,547
Scott: You know what it is?

703
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:22,870
Rym: It's the, there was time now, Twilight zone situation where you finally have the excuse to like sit down at the restaurant, like the nice one and order from the lunch menu.

704
00:33:23,414 --> 00:33:24,430
Rym: But there's a convention.

705
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:28,224
Rym: That's why you're in town in the first place and the restaurant's full and you can't sit down.

706
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:34,346
Scott: Or are you going to like leave the convention and lose an hour or two of your time to eat the lunch?

707
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,390
Scott: Or are you just going to like snack and do whatever you can to hold out until dinner?

708
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:43,530
Rym: Thus the power of magfest and the power of PAX Prime.

709
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,688
Rym: The fact that those kinds are four days means I don't feel so bad about sitting down and having a lunch somewhere.

710
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:57,930
Scott: Being 24 seven at a magfest helps for that a lot too, but the best is if you're traveling and it's not some sort of convention, you're just on vacation, right?

711
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:06,850
Scott: It's like when we were in Australia and packs was over, it was like, Oh, every day, just every three meals a day, three restaurants, three lunches of awesomeness.

712
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:11,684
Rym: We get the big brekkie every morning and then at lunch you get like a pot meat pie of some kind.

713
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:16,010
Scott: Oh, we should go back just to go back to the top on your hockey place.

714
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:16,414
Rym: Yeah.

715
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:18,502
Rym: Cause, cause I couldn't go with Emily cause.

716
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:21,889
Rym: that's in Melbourne and we were in Sydney, but it looks like I'm going to PAX Australia.

717
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:23,348
Scott: How do you know?

718
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,789
Rym: Because I have to go.

719
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:30,429
Rym: So the second PAX Australia I went to was right after this finance conference.

720
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:31,067
Rym: that's in Sydney.

721
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:32,608
Rym: The same thing's happening again.

722
00:34:32,931 --> 00:34:34,109
Rym: So I'm going to fly to Sydney.

723
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,684
Scott: So this year it was too far apart.

724
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:36,230
Rym: last year.

725
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:43,810
Rym: This year they were like two and a half weeks apart and I could not justify spending more than a month in Australia.

726
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,610
Rym: And even beyond that, I was not going to fly to Australia, fly home, fly back to Australia.

727
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:51,429
Rym: Like can you imagine doing that?

728
00:34:51,553 --> 00:34:51,600
Scott: No.

729
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:52,268
Scott: Why would you do that?

730
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:52,909
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

731
00:34:53,330 --> 00:35:04,072
Rym: So this time it looks like I can fly to Sydney, uh, spend like a week there doing work stuff, take like a weekend vacation, fly to Melbourne, do work stuff for like one day vacation for a few days

732
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:04,775
Scott: packs,

733
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:08,369
Rym: and then either fly to Singapore into a conference or just fly straight home.

734
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:14,016
Scott: I kind of want to go, but we said we'd go to Essen in 2018.

735
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:15,010
Rym: Oh yeah, well you could do both.

736
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,170
Rym: Do packs awesome 2017.

737
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:17,999
Scott: But I could go somewhere.

738
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,130
Scott: I've never been though.

739
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,268
Scott: That would be so much better.

740
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,570
Scott: A tropical place.

741
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:26,447
Rym: Thing is, if you go back to a packs AUS, you have to do Melbourne and a different place in Australia.

742
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,590
Scott: Tropical, uh, coral reef.

743
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,568
Rym: Yeah, or at least Sydney.

744
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,669
Rym: Like at least go to Sydney.

745
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:32,490
Rym: Sydney's way different.

746
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,170
Rym: You probably like Sydney.

747
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,590
Rym: Sydney's more like New York in a lot of ways.

748
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,309
Rym: Just less peace smell.

749
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,889
Scott: Let's go to coral reef.

750
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,390
Rym: Yeah, you can go to the coral reef.

751
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,310
Rym: Of course it's bleaching.

752
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,128
Rym: There's less of it to see.

753
00:35:41,992 --> 00:35:43,489
Scott: I'll go see it before it's all bleached.

754
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:46,489
Rym: You had to head up to Brisbane, hang out on the beach.

755
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:47,586
Scott: Yeah.

756
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,009
Scott: Well, I mean, if I'm going somewhere, I might as well go to the beach.

757
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:55,009
Rym: So there was for most of, you know, I actually don't like Chipotle that much.

758
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:56,070
Scott: I like Chipotle.

759
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:02,728
Rym: There was a time when that became my go to lunch because it was cheaper, but it was plenty of food and it would fill me.

760
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:13,309
Rym: And it seems to correlate with if I bike to work every day, once I've been doing that for more than a few weeks, like I'm way hungrier all the time than I used to be.

761
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:20,330
Rym: And Chipotle is one of the few meals I can eat over lunch quickly that will satisfy that like weird deep craving for calories.

762
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,348
Scott: Chipotle is great because for like eight dollars, you get a ton of food.

763
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:28,450
Rym: You get like fourteen hundred calories encased in the size and shape of your stomach.

764
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,470
Scott: And you can get all sorts of different stuff.

765
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:30,891
Scott: You can get.

766
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:35,150
Scott: the best thing is get the bowl, but ask for the soft tacos on the side.

767
00:36:36,412 --> 00:36:36,553
Scott: Right.

768
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:37,998
Scott: You can get meats mixed in.

769
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:41,010
Scott: you like I want the chicken and I also want the beef.

770
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:41,769
Scott: Give me half and half.

771
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,409
Rym: I decided a long time ago, I'll only get the sofritas.

772
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,328
Rym: I'm done with the meat there.

773
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:51,069
Scott: I do sofritas, but sometimes they also have chorizo now, which I have not been since they got the chorizo.

774
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:52,310
Scott: You haven't been in a long time.

775
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,870
Rym: I stopped going to Chipotle because that is way too many fucking calories.

776
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,029
Rym: Even for me, most of the time.

777
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:57,409
Scott: You got it.

778
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,550
Scott: You see, I don't get the guac mixed in, which costs more over the guac.

779
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,429
Rym: You got to get the guac.

780
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:02,990
Scott: The guac counts for most of the calories.

781
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,028
Scott: Yeah, but guac's real good.

782
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:05,596
Rym: All right.

783
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:07,770
Rym: I think it's still like over a thousand calories.

784
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,821
Rym: If you get the minimum possible burrito, if you I will get.

785
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:18,810
Rym: my default at Chipotle is the white rice, the black bean, it's got the flour tortilla by itself.

786
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,449
Rym: I don't three hundred.

787
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,630
Rym: The chorizo is another three hundred in the bowl.

788
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,009
Rym: I get the bowl with the tortilla like that.

789
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,529
Scott: OK, now I get the bowl.

790
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:27,690
Scott: The default my minimum, right?

791
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,950
Scott: The thing I usually get is bowl white rice, black bean, sofritas.

792
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,129
Rym: All right, wait, I'm going to do this now to get the bowl.

793
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:37,127
Rym: Uh, OK.

794
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:37,867
Rym: Sofritas.

795
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,238
Rym: Yeah.

796
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:38,946
Rym: That's good.

797
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,206
Scott: White rice, black bean.

798
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,128
Rym: Black bean.

799
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:41,890
Scott: Yeah.

800
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:43,129
Scott: The pico.

801
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:43,786
Scott: The hot.

802
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:44,208
Rym: Pico's good.

803
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,029
Scott: The hot salsa.

804
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:46,789
Rym: The red one or chili one.

805
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:47,106
Rym: Yeah.

806
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,670
Rym: I actually like the tomatillo green one more.

807
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,270
Scott: I mean, one of them, right?

808
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:50,928
Rym: Don't get the guac.

809
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:51,464
Scott: And then.

810
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:52,770
Scott: Cheese and lettuce.

811
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,249
Rym: Cheese and lettuce is the pro move.

812
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:54,770
Scott: Right.

813
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,126
Rym: That is.

814
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,966
Scott: How many calories?

815
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,030
Rym: Six hundred and thirty five calories.

816
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:00,530
Scott: That's not bad.

817
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,087
Scott: That's a good lunch.

818
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:01,465
Scott: Yeah.

819
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,850
Rym: That's a lot.

820
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:03,190
Rym: OK.

821
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,910
Rym: It is two thousand four hundred milligrams of sodium.

822
00:38:07,316 --> 00:38:07,527
Scott: Yes.

823
00:38:08,134 --> 00:38:08,502
Scott: Yes, it is.

824
00:38:09,092 --> 00:38:09,328
Scott: I see.

825
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,287
Scott: Now click on the guac and see what it goes to say.

826
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:12,850
Scott: Add your guac in there.

827
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:13,377
Rym: My guac.

828
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:16,490
Rym: Uh, eight hundred and sixty five.

829
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:18,669
Scott: It's two hundred calories of guac.

830
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,868
Scott: That's a thousand, though.

831
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:24,550
Scott: If I'm super, super hungry, you get the chips and guac and I'll get chips and guac extra.

832
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,010
Rym: that the chips and guac is like eight hundred calories by itself.

833
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:29,627
Scott: Yes.

834
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:30,064
Scott: Yeah.

835
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,148
Scott: You're supposed to share it.

836
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:31,608
Scott: But hey.

837
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,129
Rym: No, no one shares that.

838
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,509
Rym: If you have two people, you get two orders of that.

839
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:36,970
Rym: That's how we roll.

840
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:38,150
Rym: Yeah.

841
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:39,370
Rym: I just don't do the Chipotle anymore.

842
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:39,974
Rym: It's still.

843
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:41,770
Rym: it's too much food unless I'm biking to work.

844
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,170
Scott: It's so convenient and also delicious.

845
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,110
Scott: And eight dollars.

846
00:38:45,351 --> 00:38:45,810
Scott: So convenient.

847
00:38:46,214 --> 00:38:47,030
Scott: It's like anything.

848
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,230
Scott: It's like so cheap, but way better than things that cost more.

849
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:52,409
Rym: Even with their pipeline, like how fast they are.

850
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:58,849
Rym: The two Chipotle's near my office have like a 15 plus minute wait to order their Chipotle's near my work.

851
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,964
Rym: There's there's two within walking distance or two with a walking distance.

852
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:05,590
Scott: there are lines when you go in, but you're out in five minutes.

853
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:07,550
Rym: I have waited in that line.

854
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:10,930
Rym: That line goes like 10 to 15 minutes on multiple occasions.

855
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,410
Scott: Your line must be even longer than ours.

856
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,430
Rym: But that's only if I go after like twelve, fifteen.

857
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,430
Rym: Seems like most people eat lunch like twelve, thirty, one thirty.

858
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:22,729
Rym: So by eating lunch at eleven thirty, it's kind of hacks, like no one's around, like I could just sit down.

859
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:24,170
Rym: Everything's fresh.

860
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:28,029
Rym: You can't go before eleven thirty or most places don't actually have all their food out yet.

861
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:31,050
Rym: Like Takahachi, like doesn't have all the lunches like the soup's not done.

862
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,110
Scott: See, like here's a good example.

863
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:32,544
Scott: Right today.

864
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,670
Scott: I ate the last of my loaf of bread, right?

865
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:40,329
Scott: So tomorrow I'm probably going to get like I'm going to get like maximum luxury lunch tomorrow.

866
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:41,869
Rym: I'll go all out.

867
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:43,450
Rym: What is what is all out?

868
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,890
Rym: Because all out for me is I go to Zaytzeff, which is like a fancy burger joint.

869
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:52,270
Rym: I'll get like a burger, fries and a beer and like a dessert of some kind.

870
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:54,589
Rym: I mean, I'll sit there for like an hour and a half.

871
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,730
Scott: All out could be anything.

872
00:39:55,971 --> 00:40:00,430
Scott: I choose the place and then I just, you know, whatever place I choose, all out mean a waiter.

873
00:40:01,396 --> 00:40:01,827
Scott: It could be.

874
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:03,190
Scott: Who knows if I got time.

875
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:03,571
Scott: Right.

876
00:40:03,892 --> 00:40:13,010
Scott: But I choose the place and then I get, you know, the entree, some, you know, a side and a drink and, you know, like I max it out.

877
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:20,989
Scott: I get the most delicious possible things and, you know, then I don't have to eat dinner until like eight and I don't eat much dinner.

878
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,170
Rym: Yeah, well, I guess it's easier.

879
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,250
Rym: The thing is living alone.

880
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:34,110
Rym: I remember like it's very hard to cook a satisfying meal because normally a good meal has like one main thing, like a main side and then a secondary side or a salad or something.

881
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:39,750
Rym: But if it's just one person, it's hard to like make all those things in a sustainable, not wasting food.

882
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:41,030
Scott: I just make a blue apron.

883
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,090
Scott: I only eat half and I put the other half in the fridge.

884
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:49,349
Rym: The blue apron is good about that because it's main thing side thing and it all only needs like one set of cooking implements.

885
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:59,149
Rym: Actually, if I like on weekends, you can do like blue apron, lunch, dinner, cook one for lunch, cook the other one for dinner.

886
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,309
Rym: The next day, lunch and dinner again, just flip them.

887
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:02,730
Scott: Nope.

888
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,750
Scott: You can't eat the same thing.

889
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:04,088
Scott: Yes.

890
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:05,270
Rym: You won't die.

891
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:11,722
Scott: If I make a blue apron and I have half leftover, I'll eat it for lunch or dinner two days from then.

892
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,104
Rym: Yup.

893
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:13,808
Scott: Not one day from then.

894
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:20,727
Rym: So are there some things you would eat for lunch, but you have no way to get them generally like sushi.

895
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:25,729
Rym: Like I would eat sushi for lunch, but there are no sushi places that have good sushi that will deliver.

896
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,101
Rym: There are only sit down restaurants that are expensive nearby.

897
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:33,010
Scott: when I originally, I mean, I'm in New York city in the touristy area.

898
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:33,386
Scott: Yup.

899
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:36,170
Scott: If there's any kind of food I want, I can get it.

900
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:36,837
Scott: I can get any.

901
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,830
Scott: you've named the country.

902
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:39,809
Scott: I could get the food from there, right?

903
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,730
Scott: It might not be the best because of the neighborhood I'm in, but I can get it right.

904
00:41:44,071 --> 00:41:50,346
Scott: I can get anything from like, you know, a burger to astronomy, sandwich to Indian food, the Chinese.

905
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,290
Scott: I can get anything, but it might not be the top quality in any category.

906
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:58,610
Scott: The thing is there are specific dishes that I cannot get.

907
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:02,310
Scott: For example, when I first, I can get Japanese food, no problem, right?

908
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,289
Scott: There's like multiple choices.

909
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,330
Scott: I can get bentos, I can get ramens, I can get whatever.

910
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:11,730
Scott: But when I first started working there, there was a place called Teriyaki boy, right?

911
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:25,168
Scott: And you could go in there and you could get basically in what was a giant styrofoam cup, like larger than a cup noodle cup, but like the same shape basically, but big, you could get a kitsune udon and a cup.

912
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:26,012
Rym: Oh.

913
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:33,950
Scott: And that was like, that place went under cause I think they jacked the rent up on him and it hasn't been there in like, like maybe seven or eight years.

914
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,870
Scott: It's super long time.

915
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,730
Rym: There have been a succession of like three different banh mi places that were open and then were closed near my office.

916
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:41,850
Rym: Now I can get udon.

917
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:42,868
Scott: No problem.

918
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,170
Scott: I got like multiple udon noodle choices.

919
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:48,670
Scott: There is no kitsune udon at any of these places.

920
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:56,710
Rym: When I worked in midtown, there were, there were not one, not two, but three places that all had kitsune udon right next to my office.

921
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:05,730
Scott: For me to get it, I would have to walk a distance or take a subway and like, there's no one who'll deliver that, you know, there's plenty of udon, just not that specific udon.

922
00:43:05,976 --> 00:43:06,208
Scott: Yeah.

923
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,577
Scott: Right.

924
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,889
Scott: It's like, I can't get that even though I want it.

925
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:09,710
Rym: I really like it.

926
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:17,309
Rym: They also remember they discontinue, oh, the, uh, the pat walking paths and city, all park and ever realized that our deck.

927
00:43:20,101 --> 00:43:20,366
Scott: Whoop, whoop.

928
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:21,100
Scott: Exciting.

929
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:21,407
Rym: OK.

930
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,330
Rym: And I was looking at the map for lunch.

931
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,030
Rym: But anyway, I remember when they discontinued the bowl noodle kitsune udon.

932
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,169
Scott: It was not bowl noodle.

933
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:29,829
Scott: It was separate.

934
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:30,670
Scott: It was separate.

935
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:32,929
Rym: It was there kitsune udon bowl.

936
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:33,371
Scott: Yes.

937
00:43:33,672 --> 00:43:38,150
Scott: There is a. there is one kitsune udon instant that's left from another brand.

938
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,029
Scott: I haven't actually tried it.

939
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,010
Scott: It comes in a red bowl.

940
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,079
Scott: I haven't tried it.

941
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,345
Scott: I don't know.

942
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:42,749
Rym: Maybe we should try it.

943
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:47,312
Rym: Maybe I'll buy one because then I could bring a few of those to like a magfest for like quick lunch.

944
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:51,518
Scott: because, yeah, the convention lunch is like it's the bowl kinds you pour in the hot water.

945
00:43:51,843 --> 00:43:52,330
Rym: Close the lid.

946
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,750
Rym: That is perfect for like magfest when you don't want it because you can't eat it.

947
00:43:55,931 --> 00:43:56,538
Rym: Any lunch places.

948
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:57,429
Rym: They're completely full.

949
00:43:59,674 --> 00:44:08,130
Rym: Oh, you know, I go all the time, not all the time, but when I'm really hungry now, instead of Chipotle, go go curry, go go curry near me, I'd be going there.

950
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,428
Rym: There's a go go curry near me.

951
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:10,492
Rym: I eat there.

952
00:44:11,175 --> 00:44:14,550
Rym: My rule is I can never eat there more than once a week, no matter what.

953
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:15,574
Scott: There are some.

954
00:44:15,615 --> 00:44:17,030
Rym: that is a lot of food.

955
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:23,730
Scott: There are some places near me that have opened up like in the past year or two, like the melt shop or like a little beat.

956
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,910
Scott: But it's like they have good food, but it's way overpriced and too expensive.

957
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,009
Scott: There's also a lot of food carts near me that are way good.

958
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:34,910
Scott: You know, the food trucks come over and some of them are like top notch.

959
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:37,050
Rym: I used to do the food trucks.

960
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:45,273
Rym: The only reason I've stopped is that the food trucks are a bit of a walk away and they actually had way longer lines and way slower service than the places actually in buildings near me.

961
00:44:45,373 --> 00:44:48,710
Scott: It depends on which one and which day and stuff like that.

962
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,930
Rym: Well, they're all over by World Trade Center because there's no restaurants over there.

963
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,689
Scott: They're like for me, they're one block away.

964
00:44:54,012 --> 00:44:56,369
Rym: Yeah, there's like a 10 minute walk to get to where they are.

965
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,209
Rym: Yeah, I used to city bike over there when I have city bike.

966
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:06,270
Rym: That was like the best use of city bike is city bike to a different lunch place that expands the feeding area.

967
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:12,329
Scott: But even like the really popular ones that are always there, they got like a routine and they, you know, they zip things along.

968
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:13,199
Scott: Yeah, right.

969
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:13,969
Scott: Like this is one.

970
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,550
Scott: This guy is it's called like steak freak, even though it's not really a steak place.

971
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,710
Scott: It's more like, you know, like noodle bowls and stuff.

972
00:45:21,971 --> 00:45:22,394
Scott: It's really good.

973
00:45:22,796 --> 00:45:24,730
Scott: He's got a big long line, but that line moves.

974
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:29,273
Scott: And what the way he does it is you're waiting in the line and you'll get up to the front of the line.

975
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,329
Scott: And if he's only makes like two or three things at a time.

976
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:35,928
Scott: So if you're like the fourth person and they're too busy, they go up.

977
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:37,509
Scott: just wait, don't order yet.

978
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:40,530
Scott: And they finish the people they got and then they start making for you.

979
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,319
Scott: And it actually moves along like you could be.

980
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:50,789
Scott: I've been like the 10th person in line and only had to wait like 15 minutes from from, you know, getting in line to walking away with food.

981
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,598
Rym: Yeah, I guess the trouble is all the food trucks near me, they go to a place where there aren't lunch places.

982
00:45:55,638 --> 00:45:57,250
Rym: So they're actually the only lunch place.

983
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:00,730
Scott: These are actually in front of a bunch of lunch places that you deal with it.

984
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:03,110
Scott: And there's just so many people that it doesn't matter.

985
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:12,650
Rym: Yeah, I kind of almost miss working in Midtown because while the food's more expensive up there, I had a lot more variety of options.

986
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:18,009
Rym: Like I have a similar number of options downtown, but they're from a narrower band of kinds of food.

987
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:21,530
Rym: And also, there aren't any good places near me right now.

988
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,579
Rym: I don't think there's one around.

989
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,006
Rym: to see if there's one right now.

990
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:27,498
Scott: Sure, there are.

991
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:27,600
Rym: Yeah.

992
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,226
Rym: Anyway, by me.

993
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:33,149
Scott: All right, let's go.

994
00:46:33,431 --> 00:46:33,593
Rym: By me.

995
00:46:33,614 --> 00:46:34,447
Rym: Let's get it done.

996
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,660
Rym: You're hungry.

997
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,550
Rym: Yeah, you're talking about lunch.

998
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,035
Rym: You're hungry.

999
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,030
Rym: All right.

1000
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:38,830
Rym: I guess that's the end of that.

1001
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,100
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1002

1014
00:48:21,313 --> 00:48:24,549

1015
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:38,549
Rym: Also, if you plan to do a panel and you did not get a comp badge already because you have not yet been a panelist at ConnectiCon and you want to only come to ConnectiCon, if you are accepted as a panelist, let me know.

1016
00:48:39,171 --> 00:48:51,550
Rym: I can give you a link that will let you book your room despite not yet having a badge because they're hiding the room blocks unless you're already a, uh, already have a badge and I have no control over the situation, but I'm here for you.

Rym: I will help you.

1018
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:56,430

Rym: Your nose.

1021
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,559
Rym: Breathe through your nose.
