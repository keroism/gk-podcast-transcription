1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,678
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday April 10th.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,761
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,290
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:22,290
Rym: Tonight we're gonna talk about solitaire and jez ball and all those crappy little games that you're probably underestimated.

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,868
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:32,036
Rym: So for all these years, I actually never really had a digital camera.

7
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:35,135
Rym: so as a result I'd never had a flicker account or anything.

8
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:41,280
Scott: yeah I only had a film camera for a long time, and I finally bought a digital camera with year ago.

9
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:42,509
Scott: I think I don't even remember.

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,820
Rym: I remember when I was in middle school.

11
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:44,643
Rym: I took $70.

12
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:49,200
Rym: I went to service merchandise, and I bought a little 35 millimeter camera.

13
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:51,871
Scott: I had one of those Adventix ones with the weird film.

14
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,240
Scott: I actually have a roll of that film that's undeveloped.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,625
Scott: I keep forgetting to go develop it.

16
00:00:55,885 --> 00:01:03,136
Rym: actually where I'm going with that is that I found my old service merchandise camera the other day And I opened it and there's a half shot roll of film in it.

17
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,346
Scott: Oh Good pictures on there.

18
00:01:05,387 --> 00:01:07,820
Rym: those pictures are probably from middle school.

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:18,748
Rym: If my pictures are probably from like when I was in Israel or something not sure maybe high school but I pretty much it wasn't worth it to take pictures because Developing film was expensive, and then what am I gonna?

20
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:21,560
Rym: Do I have a stack of photographs from my early life?

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,731
Rym: I just what am I gonna do with them if anything?

22
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,480
Rym: I'm gonna scan him in and throw away the originals.

23
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,640
Scott: Oh, we're just never big on pictures.

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:37,359
Scott: I mean they're probably a lot of pictures of me and family vacations or whatever somewhere my parents house in some box You know, but I have a digital camera now, and I just can't remember to take pictures.

25
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:39,710
Rym: see I do because a while ago Emily.

26
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:41,960
Rym: She got a new fancy digital camera.

27
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:50,143
Rym: So she gave me her really old one which while it's not the best digital camera in the world because it's old I've never had a digital camera so it's great.

28
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:54,619
Rym: and I had this tiny little memory card for it because I haven't even bothered to buy a bigger one yet.

29
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,299
Rym: and Today for the first time I actually use the thing.

30
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:01,171
Scott: Yeah, digital cameras are at the point now.

31
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:08,720
Scott: or if you buy a fancy one It's stupid fancy and like a normal average one is so much better than any normal person cares about.

32
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:09,603
Scott: And who?

33
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:19,860
Scott: you really need photos to look like super wedding photos that you would pay $1,000 for a camera when you could get four hundred dollars one that is good enough for any normal human being.

34
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:33,520
Rym: So as you all recall the other week I learned a lot about rock climbing in a short amount of time when I attempted to do some rock climbing one weekend and almost Died and almost called 911 because I didn't think I could climb back down and I needed help and all that business.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,705
Rym: But I got out and I survived.

36
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:45,940
Rym: so today because I had my camera and I this morning I saw it and I thought I'm gonna start carrying this around everywhere because you never know I'm just gonna keep it in my car and maybe I'll get something to take a picture.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,332
Scott: Yeah, I carry mine around everywhere and I don't use it.

38
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:50,060
Rym: Well, I keep thinking take pictures.

39
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,533
Rym: So I open up my car and I took a picture of the busted part of my engine And I was just taking pictures of stuff all over.

40
00:02:55,553 --> 00:03:02,715
Rym: and then on the way home I took the mountain route and I happen to be driving past the mountain that I almost got stuck on before and I thought you Know what?

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:14,300
Rym: I'm gonna take pictures of where I got stuck and like from the bottom and then I'm gonna take pictures of all those abandoned buildings Around it and then I'll make a flicker account and put him up and one thing led to another and it was nice out.

42
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,026
Rym: So instead of just taking those pictures I ended up climbing the goddamn mountain and taking a bunch of pictures up there, too Mm-hmm.

43
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,380
Rym: So if you I'm gonna link to it.

44
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:30,220
Rym: But if you check out my flicker there are pictures of me Still in my business professional dress from work because I didn't change because I didn't expect that I'd be climbing a mountain.

45
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:32,730
Rym: Having climbed the mountain and I got some cool shots.

46
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:35,240
Scott: It's it doesn't really look like a mountain to me.

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,545
Scott: It looks like a hill.

48
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:37,970
Rym: Well, it's breakneck Ridge.

49
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,476
Rym: It's I forget exactly how tall it is.

50
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:39,878
Rym: It's like 1200 feet.

51
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:49,040
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, if you go to my flicker, which I've had for years You'll notice that I don't take pictures too often just because I don't remember to plus Hill or not.

52
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:50,706
Rym: I bet $1,000.

53
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:52,793
Rym: you couldn't make it up to the top within two hours.

54
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:54,640
Scott: I just use a grappling hook.

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,522
Rym: Grappling hook.

56
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:59,691
Rym: Yeah, that actually wouldn't really help at all.

57
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:01,717
Scott: I throw it would grab onto some tree.

58
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:02,760
Rym: There's no trees.

59
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:04,047
Scott: This is a tree.

60
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:08,305
Rym: No, she's drawn the pictures that you took Which some of those pictures.

61
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:13,080
Rym: those trees are on the white path you can climb as opposed to the blue path.

62
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:15,220
Rym: That is not so much a path but a sheer cliff.

63
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:17,267
Scott: I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult.

64
00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:19,257
Scott: If you made it up without any fancy equipment.

65
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:19,839
Scott: I could definitely go.

66
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:28,772
Rym: Yeah The point is I don't think you realize what a grappling hook is really useful for and it wouldn't be useful for climbing that Mountain by any stretch if I could just get a rope hanging down the side.

67
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:29,334
Scott: It's all good.

68
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:30,860
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

69
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:33,175
Rym: I don't think you could even if you're just a straight path.

70
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:34,000
Rym: I don't think you could do it.

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,166
Rym: You don't have the stamina.

72
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:43,540
Scott: even so your your constant trick that you keep thinking is gonna work of say Scott Can't do something in order to trick him into doing it will never work.

73
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:52,897
Rym: Because lately after that last game of Kayla's where once again room the Kayla's machine dominates I believe your argument was I could win and I could put all that effort in.

74
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,500
Rym: I just don't wanna.

75
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:55,807
Scott: That was not quite what I said.

76
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:56,770
Rym: What were you saying?

77
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,780
Scott: I was saying something far more complex that I don't.

78
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:05,575
Rym: Okay, but suffice to say the end result of your argument was I can I just don't wanna.

79
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:11,899
Scott: that was not the end result of My argument but my argument was such that I cannot blame you for interpreting it as such.

80
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:23,180
Rym: Regardless in my flicker if you're a crazy stalker You'll probably see a lot of odd pictures because I'm probably going to take a good number of pictures every single day.

81
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:24,040
Scott: See how that works.

82
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,017
Scott: I told myself I take a picture every day and I didn't and you know what lasted like a day.

83
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:29,845
Rym: so far I'm betting a thousand.

84
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:30,287
Rym: Yeah.

85
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:32,295
Scott: Yeah, I've added a thousand for a day.

86
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:32,657
Scott: Also.

87
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:37,393
Scott: Yeah I'll give you a few weeks though because you you said something.

88
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:44,719
Rym: so in the news John Romero Okay is in the news what I thought he was like just retired or whatever.

89
00:05:44,739 --> 00:06:00,972
Rym: well No, but he's still fairly active and I've always had a lot of respect for John Romero because despite all the fun people made of him he is Despite Pronoun that people made of this entity this entity known as John Romero.

90
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:03,880
Rym: You can't deny the impact he has had on gaming.

91
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:05,787
Scott: No kind of hard to die.

92
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:09,300
Scott: I mean one of the first books about the history of gaming was about him.

93
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:13,880
Rym: Well, the reason he's in the news is there's an interview and he said a lot of interesting things.

94
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:25,219
Rym: But one of the things he said to simplify greatly is he basically said that the Xbox 360 and the ps3 that paradigm of console gaming is doomed to failure.

95
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:27,127
Scott: Uh-huh.

96
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:27,610
Rym: I got a little.

97
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,714
Rym: I got a little quote here from him.

98
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:35,399
Rym: right right now MMOs mobile and PC episodic are really polarizing into the newest most important segments in gaming.

99
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:47,940
Rym: Next-gen console is but is big but the future isn't too bright with the emergence of cheap PC multi-core Processors and the big change the PC industry will go through during the next five years to accommodate the new multi-core centric hardware designs.

100
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:56,820
Rym: My prediction is that the game console in the vein of the ps3 and the Xbox 360 is either going to undergo a massive Rethink or go away altogether.

101
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:04,563
Rym: The Wii has the perfect design for a console that doesn't pretend to be a PC and is geared toward the more casual gamers Than the hardcore gamers.

102
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:05,787
Rym: the hardcore gamers?

103
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:16,000
Rym: are they gonna be playing their new PCs or their new PC like platform that sits in their Living room but still serves the whole house over Wi-Fi and even video signal that man can talk in a run-on sentence.

104
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,642
Rym: I tell you what.

105
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:17,043
Scott: Yeah.

106
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:25,640
Scott: Well, I think the thing he's not realizing is that the ps3 whatever but the Xbox 360 is the PC-like platform in the living room that he's talking about.

107
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,380
Scott: That's why it killed off PC gaming because it's basically a PC that you don't have to deal with all the PC bullshit to do.

108
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:37,003
Rym: He talks a lot more and I think part of it just comes down to The Xbox.

109
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:42,798
Rym: and what makes it popular now is it's doing a lot of things that PCs did a long time ago better.

110
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:45,152
Scott: Yeah, it's just more accessible.

111
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:46,300
Scott: It's easier to play online.

112
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:55,006
Scott: you don't have to do a bunch of bullshit to set up a voice chat or a video chat or Download extra content or patch your games.

113
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:57,132
Scott: It's like PC gaming that just works.

114
00:07:57,714 --> 00:07:59,740
Scott: but at the same time 360 is kind of cool.

115
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:05,320
Rym: It's PC gaming that's really limited because once the hardware is out the hardware is not going to advance for a while.

116
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:07,239
Rym: You've got to develop for the hardware.

117
00:08:08,082 --> 00:08:12,266
Rym: luckily, there's Xbox Live and all that and Theoretically something for the ps3.

118
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:17,857
Rym: but it's a lot harder to just make a game and get it on a console than it is To make a game for the PC.

119
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:18,923
Scott: Well, that's the thing.

120
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:23,779
Scott: is the Xbox 360 from a developer game developers standpoint is a PC.

121
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:28,124
Scott: It's no different than making a game for Windows Like literally you can.

122
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:31,013
Scott: they have a dev kit the Microsoft XNA dev kit.

123
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:36,399
Scott: you make a game and then it builds the game for Windows and Xbox in one go.

124
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:37,946
Scott: It's not the same thing.

125
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:44,426
Rym: his main argument seems to be that PCs currently partly with this whole.

126
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:52,179
Rym: Intel is kind of busting out with new technology left and right lately and IBM has been busting out and AMD has been slashing their prices.

127
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:58,697
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I'm keeping an eye on that situation for everyone because I'm pretty much gonna buy a PC.

128
00:08:59,038 --> 00:08:59,600
Rym: the day.

129
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:05,200
Rym: The value is like perfect like the perfect equilibrium of chip prices and motherboard prices and RAM prices.

130
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:11,184
Scott: All the stars will just line up and then the moon will make a little eclipse and then up the chips will come out of The fab and we'll buy them.

131
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:21,446
Rym: Yep, and then holy shit rims gonna have his first new PC and going on seven seven or eight Years, I really want a new PC because there's a lot of games I want to play that I wasn't able to play.

132
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:28,285
Rym: but this argument is that PCs are getting stupidly fast stupidly quickly and They're.

133
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:39,067
Rym: it's getting to the point where PCs are ever upgradable and infinitely fast while consoles can't be can't keep up the same thing if They're still trying to do the same thing that PC does.

134
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:55,160
Rym: and I think he thinks that the games that are popular on the Xbox And the ps3 will eventually just by sheer economics Migrate to PCs and a console like that a console that is just a specialized computer Will not be a viable market in the future.

135
00:09:55,555 --> 00:10:05,812
Scott: well I think the only thing I disagree with him on is the fact that he seems to think that Computing power is the limitation in game design now.

136
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:06,815
Rym: Sometimes it is.

137
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:08,078
Scott: sometimes it is.

138
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:08,720
Scott: that is correct.

139
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,190
Rym: I mean I don't for thanks.

140
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:15,693
Scott: in flight simulators Computing power is the limitation and how good our flight simulators can be.

141
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:17,700
Rym: or doom - did you ever see the original?

142
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,858
Rym: Concept demos of doom and all those game pretty sad.

143
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:32,536
Rym: No No no actually doom was going to be a lot more than what doom actually was and a lot of things had to be dropped because Computers just weren't fast enough and there was no way to do it back then.

144
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:35,707
Scott: but nowadays Unless all you care about is graphics.

145
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:45,119
Scott: if you're going for a game that is fun and entertaining and will occupy you for a long Amount of time, you know graphics are the only real thing that pushes the CPU.

146
00:10:45,641 --> 00:11:02,958
Rym: Well, well it did not necessarily because supreme commander while it does push the graphics quite a bit a lot of the benchmarks and things I see point out that the graphics are a very minor part of its performance and It pushes the processor just for the shared data manipulation of all the entities that you're interacting with.

147
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:06,616
Scott: that is possible But that's one case one specific genre.

148
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:07,078
Scott: what you know?

149
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:16,300
Scott: What's really holding games back is that we only have a few Genres and we just keep churning out more and more things in those genres without coming up with new stuff.

150
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:17,340
Rym: Well, not even new stuff.

151
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:38,360
Rym: All they'd have to do is there are genres of gaming that have effectively disappeared and if someone made a game in these genres and that game was at At least in terms of gameplay as good as the old games just with updated sound and graphics and plot and things We've learned about gaming in the last decade It could re revolutionize the gaming industry in my opinion.

152
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:39,605
Scott: Well see what I've noticed.

153
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:43,743
Scott: actually in examining like the history of a lot of you know I've lived through this.

154
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:47,180
Scott: so I guess I know you look at any game genre, right?

155
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,744
Scott: Let's look at the FPS.

156
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,791
Scott: right you come out with the brand new genre.

157
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:53,120
Scott: The first game in the genre is always amazing.

158
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,447
Scott: It's like oh my god a whole new type of game insane.

159
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:57,293
Scott: Yeah, I mean everyone look Wolfenstein 3d.

160
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,580
Rym: people said what first-person shooter?

161
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:03,933
Scott: Hot shit, right, but then you have this new idea and it's hot shit.

162
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:05,980
Scott: people improve upon the idea.

163
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,857
Scott: You know, you get your doom 1 you're doomed to etc, etc, etc.

164
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:15,398
Scott: And eventually you reach the game the game that sets the standard your half-life 1 BAM.

165
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:25,420
Scott: There's the FPS half-life 1. some other people make some great FPS But pretty much everything after the hot shit game is finally out is just and whatever.

166
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,547
Scott: So I counter-strike is still number one.

167
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:31,700
Scott: I mean FPS is to that are out today are so much better than counter-strike.

168
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:32,958
Scott: I mean you cannot deny.

169
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,029
Scott: However, there's nothing wrong with counter-strike.

170
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,877
Scott: It was the first game in the FPS genre.

171
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:39,680
Scott: So they all right.

172
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,020
Scott: There's nothing wrong with it anymore.

173
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:50,760
Rym: so if I've got a game that satisfies my desire to play in a genre that's that 90% satisfies my desire and It 90% satisfies everyone else's desire.

174
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,226
Rym: So everyone's playing it.

175
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,119
Rym: if a new game comes out that satisfies it.

176
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:56,522
Rym: 92% mm-hmm.

177
00:12:57,084 --> 00:13:02,180
Rym: How many people are going to abandon all they've been doing to try something new and stick with something new?

178
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:04,140
Scott: yeah, the same thing happened with like.

179
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:12,114
Rym: There was one MMO and then there were two and I played it.

180
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,200
Scott: all crappy and ever quest is crap.

181
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,220
Scott: Well, they were all fun.

182
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:16,853
Rym: Yeah, they just they.

183
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:22,169
Rym: they were good but they weren't good enough to get a Complete market share a complete mind share.

184
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,880
Rym: and they kept coming and there were more and more and ever quest got really popular.

185
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,500
Rym: But then another game and every time a new game came people would migrate bit by bit and the old ones would just slowly die.

186
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:38,466
Rym: And then World of Warcraft came and while it's definitely not the perfect MMO It passed the threshold.

187
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:42,880
Rym: the threshold of the majority of people who want to play an MMO are gonna play this one game.

188
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,914
Scott: Yep, RTS is you had Warcraft one, but Starcraft after Starcraft.

189
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:48,957
Scott: Oh, that's that's it.

190
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:49,960
Scott: That's the game.

191
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,848
Rym: Well, I don't know supreme commander.

192
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,660
Rym: I'm really excited about I really want to play it.

193
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,731
Scott: Yeah, I'm not saying that you can't make a better game.

194
00:13:56,792 --> 00:14:01,534
Scott: But generally in any one genre I mean, I'm sort of reach a game and that's that's.

195
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:02,900
Scott: that's as far as that's gonna go.

196
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,750
Scott: You know everyone who comes after you might improve you might improve a lot, but it's mostly just knockoffs here and there Trying to rehash with slight improve

197
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:17,720
Rym: like look xcom mission UFO Which is lauded by a lot of people including experts as one of the greatest PC games ever made.

198
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:19,339
Rym: Look at all the sequels.

199
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:21,286
Rym: They were all basically the same.

200
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:24,456
Rym: terror from the deep xcom 2 was the exact same.

201
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,209
Rym: game reskins slightly So it's worse graphics.

202
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,980
Scott: What's the limitation in games?

203
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,110
Scott: I think is not that you don't have enough power to make the game you want, you know.

204
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,719
Scott: Yeah, that's completely different thing.

205
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,388
Scott: but the idea that you have to meet.

206
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:47,400
Scott: you can either come up with a new genre of gaming and then bring it up to.

207
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:53,636
Scott: You know, it's maximum game or you can find a genre that was never fully developed.

208
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,280
Scott: like star control.

209
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,580
Scott: You start control - you might say that was the one but I don't think that genre was taken all the way.

210
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:08,480
Rym: Well, there's also the that you could have a confluence of ideas where you take two things That could be integrated to make something that is more than the two things by themselves.

211
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:20,271
Scott: Yes, and I do agree that the PC has the potential to be the system where it's at mostly because unlike Consoles anyone and their mother can make a PC game.

212
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:20,813
Rym: Yep.

213
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:21,695
Rym: Furthermore.

214
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:30,144
Rym: No one has to no one can tell you You can't make a PC game while the ps3 and the Xbox and even though we have where you can get stuff online To play on your machine.

215
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:37,740
Rym: It's not really like the PC where there's no limit at all to what you can get online and PCs are infinitely extensible.

216
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:47,818
Rym: I mean if you make a PC game that needs a peripheral like a Joystick people are gonna buy the joystick and they did back in the day and if games that needed joysticks came back There'd be joysticks again.

217
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:56,247
Rym: But if you make a game for a console and it needs some special thing and that thing didn't come with the console No one's gonna play your game.

218
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:59,160
Rym: Your games just gonna be this niche game forever and never expand.

219
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,763
Scott: Well, I don't know.

220
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:02,435
Scott: That's a lot of guitar heroes are being sold.

221
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:03,660
Scott: I wouldn't say that too quickly.

222
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,498
Rym: Well guitar heroes and DDR and all those games I think are an exception because it's not like.

223
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:10,020
Rym: it's not like that.

224
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:16,438
Scott: A lot of people bought that mech game scarily enough, but not as seller Yeah But not as many P.

225
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:24,023
Rym: It didn't become this huge game and then it slowly petered out fairly quickly and I played the game and in my opinion It was rubbish.

226
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:28,580
Scott: But yeah, I don't think it was a very good game overall, but it did sell a hell of a lot.

227
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:39,577
Rym: I mean it didn't sell as much as guitar here But think about it when it came out right and then the months afterward at RIT Which is like a center of gaming and all these geeks there were like five people who had that.

228
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:40,620
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty good.

229
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:42,771
Scott: Most games sell almost nothing.

230
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,439
Scott: So that's it's a pretty good selling game.

231
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:49,719
Scott: Anyway, my point is is that because the PC you anyone can make a game for it.

232
00:16:50,161 --> 00:17:06,827
Scott: The future and hope of PC gaming is if people go out and make games in Brand new genres that are like no other games we've ever seen, you know Katamari was and like what other games recently like all the games that Introversion software is making the Darwinia uplink guys.

233
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:11,480
Scott: Um, that's that's the hope of PC gaming right there and not more chips.

234
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,647
Rym: Effectively the hope of PC gaming is steam right now.

235
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,415
Scott: Well steam is just a distribution platform.

236
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:28,050
Rym: Yes, but the whole idea I think that now on PCs you can have a distribution model that entirely eliminates Anything physical on the Xbox.

237
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,200
Rym: no matter how much you download from Xbox Live.

238
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:38,800
Rym: Xbox games are still gonna be a disc that you go to the store and you buy You go to Amazon you buy and it comes and you keep it around on a PC.

239
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,033
Rym: I mean look most of the gaming stores around here in downstate, New York.

240
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:43,840
Rym: They don't have PC gaming sections.

241
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,623
Rym: They don't even bother.

242
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:46,710
Rym: yet PC games still sell.

243
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,014
Rym: people still buy steam games.

244
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,740
Rym: Just they just do it online.

245
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,704
Rym: Why go to a store?

246
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:51,909
Rym: Why even have the store?

247
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:54,380
Rym: There's no reason to sell a box for a PC game anymore.

248
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:57,753
Scott: It just goes hand in hand with the people can.

249
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:03,157
Scott: anyone can make a PC game but that won't help you if it's not easy to sell a PC game.

250
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:05,205
Scott: and Breaking the barrier to entry.

251
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:11,266
Scott: where anyone can sell a PC game and distribute it by steam or equivalent is What is necessary.

252
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:13,420
Scott: if PC games were still mostly sold in stores?

253
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,899
Scott: Then it wouldn't matter if someone out there made an awesome brand new PC game a new exciting genre Because they wouldn't be able to get it out there.

254
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,736
Rym: But yeah, this interview is pretty short and it's kind of interesting.

255
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:25,303
Rym: So check it out All right.

256
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:28,153
Scott: So yesterday in the virtual console, you know a game came out.

257
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:28,936
Rym: what game came?

258
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:32,402
Scott: one of my favorite games ever Custer's revenge.

259
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:38,940
Scott: No, it was Galaga the sequel to Galaxian and one of the best space shooting games ever.

260
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:42,037
Scott: I've gotten to like level 60 something in Galaga one time.

261
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:45,496
Rym: God I was never good at galley, but any kind of space shooter.

262
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:46,220
Rym: I'm just a sad.

263
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:48,413
Scott: I'll have to do a little how-to on Galaga.

264
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:49,500
Scott: It'll take like five minutes.

265
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:57,630
Rym: Not a very complex game, you know a Galaga how-to and I'll do I don't know by on a commando or Commandos a little more complex than Galaga zookeeper.

266
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:02,367
Rym: I set the high score at Katsucon on zookeeper Yeah, or Bart at root beer tapper.

267
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:07,806
Scott: Yeah, so Galaga it came out on the Wii yesterday But I didn't get a chance to play Wii yesterday.

268
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:09,192
Scott: I was busy and I was.

269
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:10,256
Scott: I said to myself.

270
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:13,429
Scott: All right for five bucks I'll buy it tomorrow cuz I really like Galaga.

271
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:14,031
Scott: Oh, yeah.

272
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:18,796
Rym: In fact, he said while I was editing the show We just finished up and he's like, hey, I'm gonna go buy this right now.

273
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:19,218
Rym: then he didn't.

274
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,899
Scott: well I didn't buy Galaga and I was planning to buy it today when I got home, but I haven't bought it.

275
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,164
Rym: Why is that?

276
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:27,896
Scott: Why didn't I buy the Galaga that I said I was gonna buy?

277
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:28,780
Scott: am I just a shit talker?

278
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,564
Rym: I think you are and you're dumb.

279
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:33,012
Scott: No, I'm actually very very smart.

280
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:35,560
Scott: You see because today a news came out.

281
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,375
Rym: Oh, I see you ready for this news.

Rym: All right, so Galaxian.

289
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:58,347
Rym: All right bonus Xevious.

290
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:00,713
Rym: No, I actually really like Xevious.

291
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:02,398
Scott: This is kind of bad.

292
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:03,220
Scott: I don't really want it.

293
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,686
Rym: I'm bad at these games.

294
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,393
Rym: So I like the bad ones.

295
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:07,397
Rym: What do you want from me?

296
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:08,080
Scott: Mappy?

297
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:09,266
Rym: What do you mean?

298
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:09,949
Rym: Mappy land?

299
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,079
Scott: I think so it's a little mouse I think so.

300
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,390
Scott: Okay was bad as Mappy ma PPY.

301
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:21,255
Scott: All right, if that's actually Mappy land Tower of Druaga, I've heard of that but I don't really know about it.

302
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:23,412
Scott: Uh dig dug to.

303
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:30,897
Scott: Well, I have to dig that to any s cartridge downstairs But I haven't played that game in a long time and that is sort of this long lost game.

304
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:33,548
Scott: dig dug to Because you didn't really dig down.

305
00:20:33,588 --> 00:20:36,320
Scott: you dug sideways and you broke up this island into pieces.

306
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:38,200
Rym: It's almost as good as the original dig dug.

307
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:38,702
Scott: Yeah, it's.

308
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:53,691
Scott: it's actually really similar, but it's kind of weird and it's a game not many people know about pac-man 1. alright and pac-man verse See pac-man verse is a game for the the Gamecube.

309
00:20:53,812 --> 00:20:58,947
Rym: basically you can buy this game for the Gamecube and it came with some other Bullshit pac-man game.

310
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,394
Scott: Well, no you there was.

311
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:04,740
Scott: basically it was weird How they originally released this game because you couldn't buy it on its own.

312
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,440
Scott: It would always come with another game.

313
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:12,861
Scott: So if you wanted it you had to like buy our racing revolution for Gamecube and it would come with pac-man verse or you would Buy.

314
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:14,688
Rym: the game shall not be man.

315
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:18,260
Scott: the game that shall not be mentioned perhaps the worst game ever made.

316
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,206
Scott: Yeah, it came with pac-man verse.

317
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,535
Scott: so but pac-man versus really the game you wanted see.

318
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:29,813
Rym: now pac-man verse to me Was this revolutionary thing because it's this little game.

319
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:32,220
Rym: It's a game that you couldn't sell as a full-price game.

320
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:33,900
Scott: You could sell for five bucks, man.

321
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,620
Rym: It's basically just a small minigame on a little Gamecube disc.

322
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:57,108
Rym: The thing is what it was is a perfectly wonderfully executed multiplayer pac-man that used that so rarely used connected GBA to the Gamecube Functionality where one guy displays pac-man, but the other three people they're the ghosts But they can only see a little area around.

323
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,580
Scott: one guy's playing pac-man on his GBA.

324
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:06,320
Scott: That's connected to the Gamecube and the other three people are looking at the TV trying to catch the pac-man who's playing on the SP.

325
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,600
Rym: Yep Now if you catch pac-man you become pac-man and get a bunch of points and you trade controllers.

326
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:15,480
Scott: You give him your Gamecube controller and he gives you the SP or the GBA.

327
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Rym: This starts to break down after about an hour unless you have wave birds.

328
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:23,820
Scott: Yeah, if you don't have wave birds the cables get all jumbled up and you have to untwist them after a while.

329
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:25,290
Scott: But it's really awesome.

330
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,747
Scott: And if it's on the DS, oh Shit.

331
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:35,900
Rym: because I got to say when we got this game We played this pac-man game for hours and hours and hours at almost every opportunity for quite some time.

332
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,260
Scott: I think it's actually gonna be better on the DS because you eliminate the problem of ghosts looking at each other's area.

333
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:48,991
Scott: Ah, but that's a creak a key key part of the strategy Haha, and you also eliminate the swapping of controllers and things.

334
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:53,122
Scott: now think about this pac-man verse on the game on the DS Right.

335
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:56,639
Scott: Imagine if there was a game a DS cartridge that was just pac-man.

336
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:57,964
Rym: first I'd pay 30 bucks for it.

337
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:01,096
Scott: Guess how much this Namco museum is gonna cost.

338
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:01,900
Rym: how much Scott?

339
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,845
Rym: $20, wait a minute.

340
00:23:03,886 --> 00:23:07,020
Rym: I would have paid 20 bucks for all those other games except this pac-man.

341
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:09,506
Rym: I would have paid 30 bucks just for the pac-man.

342
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:10,409
Scott: hot shit.

343
00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:14,660
Scott: Wait a minute, but think about this right 20 bucks for eight games.

344
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:20,160
Scott: The Galaga on the virtual console was $5.

345
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,540
Scott: Basically it cost twice as much if you buy it on the virtual console.

346
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,805
Scott: Then if you buy it on the DS well and the DS one is better because first of all You're getting a physical thing.

347
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:30,432
Scott: Whereas on the virtual console, you're not getting it.

348
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:31,959
Rym: But didn't we just say that that's bad?

349
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:35,529
Scott: Well, yeah Anyway, at the same time it's a portable one.

350
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,019
Scott: a portable one is better than it's not like.

351
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:41,574
Scott: well I got the one to be any worse on the DS than it is on the way.

352
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:47,196
Rym: the one argument I could make Would be that well the one on the DS you can't play it on your big screen.

353
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:49,579
Rym: It's Here's the thing.

354
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:57,642
Rym: So we can talk about the Wii and the GameCube and the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

355
00:23:57,642 --> 00:24:11,024
Rym: But the fact remains that far and away by an order of magnitude Forever the most the best most awesome most popular most selling most perfect console in the world is the Nintendo DS.

356
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:13,196
Scott: DS is kicking all sorts of what like 25 million.

357
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,950
Rym: No, and the Nintendo DS?

358
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,962
Scott: all I know is that I look at the Amazon order I just put in.

359
00:24:19,982 --> 00:24:22,189
Scott: I ordered Pokemon red and green.

360
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:27,465
Scott: that way we can get the old Pokemon and our new Pokemon diamond and pearl Played Pokemon.

361
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:32,160
Scott: No, I that's GBA and DS which are all being played on the DS and I ordered Super Paper Mario.

362
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:35,220
Scott: So so far that's two to one or four to one.

363
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,009
Scott: However, you want to measure it see the DS.

364
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,220
Rym: when it came out Nintendo was really worried about it not succeeding.

365
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,062
Rym: I mean it was even.

366
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:46,435
Rym: they kept making up this line of yeah, it's the third pillar.

367
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:53,012
Rym: We're not getting rid of the Gameboy And that way if it failed they could just kind of.

368
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:54,196
Rym: you know, it didn't fail.

369
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:55,180
Rym: it's serving its purpose.

370
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:02,127
Scott: Well, that's what they did with the the Virtual Boy because the Game Boy was out and the SNES was out and the Virtual Boy Came and then it fails.

371
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:02,971
Scott: They just put it away.

372
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:04,599
Rym: It didn't just fail.

373
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:08,169
Scott: I don't know if it catastrophically failed.

374
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:13,328
Rym: Actually the funny thing is despite how poorly it did I know like seven people who had one.

375
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,955
Scott: I only played one at Toys R Us.

376
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,320
Rym: I never knew I played one at Myers.

377
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,440
Scott: Well, I know people now who owned them, but I never knew anyone who owned one back in the day.

378
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:26,028
Rym: Oh, no, but all the people I know now who owned one owned one back in the day They bought it like when it came out.

379
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:27,980
Scott: Yeah, Katsu says he has one or had one.

380
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,520
Rym: My friend Adam in high school had one that he really liked except he hurt his neck trying to play it.

381
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:36,794
Scott: Yeah, the only good games for it were like Wario something tennis and Mario tennis.

382
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,500
Scott: all Mario tennis a shooting game.

383
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,022
Scott: It was red.

384
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:40,206
Scott: It basically had three games.

385
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:41,712
Rym: Wasn't that the first Mario tennis?

386
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:43,700
Scott: I think it was the first Mario tennis.

387
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,535
Rym: Anyway, the DS is the best console and to the I mean it's.

388
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:51,320
Rym: I use it as a primary console.

389
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:55,333
Rym: I was the first handheld where I would sit in my own house.

390
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:56,357
Rym: It wasn't just.

391
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:57,400
Rym: oh, it's a portable system.

392
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:57,661
Rym: It's.

393
00:25:58,022 --> 00:26:03,892
Rym: I'm gonna sit in my house in my living room in my video rocker in front of my TV Playing a DS.

394
00:26:04,235 --> 00:26:19,878
Rym: Yep So I don't really worry about Nintendo because they're laughing all the way to the bank things of the day.

395
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:28,064
Rym: So I normally lately been trying to avoid just doing something that was on or near the top of dig recently And I saw this link.

396
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:33,077
Rym: I kept seeing it - oh my god this really hard hack of the Mario 1 ROM.

397
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,065
Rym: Oh my god It's impossible.

398
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:35,446
Rym: Hello.

399
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:38,300
Scott: I know this happens a lot lately like hey, did you see this?

400
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:44,551
Scott: and it's like I would see the link but I didn't care to click on it and then you'll actually click on it and Then I'll see it or vice-versa.

401
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:46,142
Rym: cuz half the time you do that to me You're like rims.

402
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:47,509
Rym: You see the crazy guy going nuts.

403
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:48,735
Rym: I'm like what crazy guy.

404
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:49,600
Rym: I saw the link to that.

405
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:51,751
Scott: Yeah, I keep seeing the link to the head.

406
00:26:51,771 --> 00:26:52,676
Scott: I keep reading the headline.

407
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:53,460
Scott: I didn't read the story.

408
00:26:53,560 --> 00:27:04,420
Rym: Well, I decided to watch this one because I was in my room uploading to flicker and that took a while Even though I found I searched for flicker on the repository in Ubuntu and I found exactly one program.

409
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,346
Scott: You can use f-spot.

410
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:07,480
Rym: Oh cuz I just used a K flicker.

411
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:08,505
Scott: I use f-spot.

412
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:09,932
Rym: a flicker is actually really nice.

413
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,379
Scott: f-spot is really nice.

414
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:13,628
Rym: now I'll try it but K flicker was really nice.

415
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:15,697
Scott: is what f-spot does forget it.

416
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,903
Rym: It's Monday.

417
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:24,316
Rym: All right, so I click on this thing and It starts and Mario just falls to his death immediately.

418
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:37,075
Rym: He starts in the air and basically This is a 22 minute video of a human being who is a very good Mario one player probably I'd say a top hundred in the world.

419
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,983
Scott: He's better than me That's for sure.

420
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:49,826
Rym: This guy is one of those people who could like do a speedrun of Mario 1 and 99% of the time win with a decent time like remember they are the first well the first Speedrun that was all over the internet.

421
00:27:49,847 --> 00:27:52,336
Scott: that Mario 3 1 where he kept bouncing on the Bob-ombs.

422
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:53,180
Rym: Oh, it was tight.

423
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:55,290
Scott: Yeah, this guy is as good as that guy.

424
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:59,991
Rym: Well that guy did it with a tool I know but that this is yeah, but this isn't a tool.

425
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:00,654
Rym: This is a human.

426
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:01,980
Rym: Yes, it's obvious.

427
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:07,637
Rym: Now the thing is this is the hardest Mario ever made.

428
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:15,680
Rym: it is specifically designed to be as Absolutely impossible as possible while still being possible to be one.

429
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:23,000
Scott: Well, I don't think that there's any mathematical proof that this is definitely the hardest that Mario can possibly be.

430
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,866
Rym: Oh sure, there might be one slightly hard.

431
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:27,977
Scott: However, however, this is fucking hard now.

432
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:28,840
Scott: You can't really.

433
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:30,931
Rym: The guy was doesn't matter.

434
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:34,323
Rym: I was given infinite lives and You got don't?

435
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:35,327
Rym: you have to watch the whole thing.

436
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:38,779
Rym: watch like the first five or ten minutes because it's basically he dies.

437
00:28:39,703 --> 00:28:41,514
Rym: Alright start over he dies.

438
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:42,519
Rym: Alright start over.

439
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:52,363
Rym: He gets to like the first little bit and he jumps to the second bit and you see this fucking blooper there you're like, oh no, and then he dies and It is going.

440
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:53,206
Rym: it's going fine.

441
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:58,184
Rym: And then eventually there's one point where he gets past something and you're like hot shit He's gonna make it.

442
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:02,480
Rym: and then he runs and there's this gap and there's a pipe on the other end.

443
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:07,040
Rym: He runs he jumps to get to the pipe before the flame hits him.

444
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:13,760
Rym: There's an invisible fucking block at the exact perfect fucking spot and he hits it and goes right into the pit and dies.

445
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,775
Scott: I'll spoil one more thing from the video all the pipe.

446
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:19,969
Scott: Yes So, you know you're playing a Mario game.

447
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,456
Scott: Your first instinct is hey a pipe.

448
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:22,260
Scott: I've never seen before.

449
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:28,896
Rym: Let me try to go down it especially in a game like this where yes You're getting fucked at every turn if you can skip even two panels of this.

450
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:29,439
Rym: It's great.

451
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,597
Scott: Yep I had seen this video enough because there's like a minute in maybe I don't know.

452
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:40,384
Scott: and I had seen enough of this video to know this game was gonna pull every trick in the book to just kill you if you Fucked up at all.

453
00:29:40,827 --> 00:29:50,299
Scott: and he as soon as he started ducking on that pipe I'm like that pipes just gonna drop him into a hole and sure enough The best part is the pipe drops him into a hole, right?

454
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,771
Rym: But there's still coins in there and there's still an exit.

455
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:55,838
Rym: he even got some of the coins.

456
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:08,369
Rym: I think No, I wish I would pay a lot of money to have a dual video where one side of the screen is the Mario and The other side of the screen is the dude playing this.

457
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:13,455
Scott: they must have had like a giant bucket of NES controllers cuz he uses to smash them on every single play.

458
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:18,935
Rym: this video is Fascinating and yet it feels just as bad as watching that video.

459
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:27,040
Rym: the guy who goes nuts in the elevator Where every time he dies, I'm just like ah, oh, I felt just like I had done it and I had died.

460
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:29,266
Rym: You can see.

461
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:33,820
Rym: he starts getting pissed off cuz toward the end he starts dying on the same trick like over and over again.

462
00:30:35,982 --> 00:30:36,465
Rym: Now I'm gonna.

463
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:42,259
Rym: I'm gonna spoil one thing at the end so you won't hate me You don't have to watch to the end because he doesn't fucking make it.

464
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,959
Rym: He gets like a quarter of the way through the second part.

465
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,065
Scott: Yeah, he beats.

466
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:48,897
Scott: he eventually does beat 1-1, but he doesn't beat 1-2.

467
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,300
Scott: He just keeps dying and then gives up and that the video's over.

468
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,260
Rym: Yeah, so pretty much every beats 1-1. just look at 1-2 for like a second.

469
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,797
Scott: Yeah, don't bother actually sitting there watching this video because there's no climax or ending.

470
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:01,620
Scott: It doesn't go anywhere.

471
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:09,503
Rym: He if anything if you're a gamer this video is going to be wonderful and hilarious and yet it's going to piss you off All right.

472
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:18,460
Scott: So while we're talking about different genres of games there There's a genre of game that not many people know about other than super nerds and that genre is roguelikes.

473
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:22,733
Scott: No, it's kind of funny because you know, what do you call doom?

474
00:31:22,774 --> 00:31:23,917
Scott: What genre is doom in?

475
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:24,680
Scott: It's it's an FPS.

476
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,986
Scott: It's a first-person shooter.

477
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:27,193
Scott: You know what genre is half-life.

478
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,520
Scott: It's also a first-person shooter.

479
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:33,654
Scott: Imagine if you called quake a doom like or a wolfenstein like.

480
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:35,079
Rym: granted there were doom likes.

481
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,274
Rym: There were a lot of games that ripped off - but no one called them doom likes.

482
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:39,896
Scott: not all them.

483
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:41,020
Scott: FPS is plus.

484
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,782
Rym: this isn't like.

485
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:48,462
Rym: you don't call Sonic the Hedgehog a Mario like and this isn't like someone just like it's the great Gianna sisters is a Mario like.

486
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:51,956
Scott: it definitely is a Mario like but you don't call it that.

487
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:52,799
Scott: you call it a platform.

488
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,918
Rym: now Imagine if this was a semi legitimate genre where pretty much everyone who knew about it called it that.

489
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:03,554
Scott: yes There's a game called rogue a long time ago, and it was basically an ASCII game.

490
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:04,357
Rym: Don't play it.

491
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:05,260
Rym: It's done played.

492
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:16,720
Rym: I like it only because it's cool to like it and I tried to play it and I got really into it for like an hour and in that hour I learned that I can't get very far without dying.

493
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:27,440
Scott: Basically, you're a little at symbol and you use the arrows on your keyboard to move around a map Which is made of dots and lines and slashes and all the different characters that you can possibly type in ASCII.

494
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:28,264
Rym: Don't be fooled.

495
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:30,093
Rym: This is one of the most complex fucking games ever.

496
00:32:30,354 --> 00:32:31,540
Scott: Oh, it's stupidly complex.

497
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:31,961
Scott: There's like.

498
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:37,840
Scott: every button on the keyboard is a different command like dig or jump or search or pick up.

499
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:41,177
Scott: You have an inventory you have levels you have stats.

500
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:43,706
Scott: It's a Ludicrously complex game credit.

501
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:46,795
Scott: It's not as with the most primitive interface possible.

502
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:48,500
Rym: It's not as bad as that stupid dwarf.

503
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,302
Rym: Whatever game.

504
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:52,190
Rym: remember that Oh God that thing Oh God.

505
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,253
Scott: No, don't talk about that.

506
00:32:53,274 --> 00:33:00,720
Scott: So yeah, that's a game called rogue and If you want to play a game like rogue nowadays net hack is pretty much the standard.

507
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:02,486
Scott: That's that's the game people play.

508
00:33:02,586 --> 00:33:03,288
Scott: It's open source.

509
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:03,850
Scott: It's free.

510
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:08,787
Scott: You can just get a copy of net hack and play it and Then you'll know what rogue games are like.

511
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:09,991
Scott: roguelikes are like.

512
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:10,352
Scott: Yes.

513
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:12,500
Scott: They're like like also like net hack.

514
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,714
Scott: Cuz net hack is a roguelike.

515
00:33:13,836 --> 00:33:20,560
Scott: anyway What if somebody made a roguelike game that was also like another kind of game?

516
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,883
Rym: What kind of game?

517
00:33:21,944 --> 00:33:25,520
Rym: because Scott didn't really tell me what he was looking at here for this thing of the day.

518
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:33,420
Rym: And then he said come here and I come over and he showed me something that Surprised me and filled me with a small amount of awe and respect.

519
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:46,160
Rym: What if you took say I don't know Zelda and made it roguelike but still Zelda and The end result is something that you probably not can actually want to play more than a few seconds.

520
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:55,660
Rym: But the fact that the game works and is a real game is amazing And it's surprising that this game is like in every way.

521
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,768
Scott: This is a roguelike game except it has music a pretty good music actually well And it's completely skinned and themed.

522
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:08,739
Scott: yeah as far as ASCII can be skinned as far as asking me But you turn it on and you know it's a Zelda game.

523
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:09,885
Scott: It is it is.

524
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:16,772
Scott: they've taken the ASCII character set and they've completely It's Zelda through and through a hundred percent.

525
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:26,998
Rym: This is definitely proof that Minimalist ideas in gaming that if you're made designing a game Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying that games have to be minimalist in fact far from it.

526
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:37,197
Rym: But at its core at the very core of any game is a very simple concept and that Concept can be readily identified by gamers.

527
00:34:37,237 --> 00:34:40,608
Scott: yes, and Well, it's not just Zelda roguelike.

528
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:45,925
Scott: They got a Metroid roguelike and a Castlevania roguelike Bad asses.

529
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:46,708
Scott: so

530
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:47,451
Rym: if you

531
00:34:47,512 --> 00:35:05,013
Scott: know Zelda Metroid in Castlevania I suggest you go and like for just a couple of minutes Learn like the basics of playing a game like net hacker rogue And then play these things so that you can get the joke and be like oh Cuz if you just go straight to these without playing a roguelike game.

532
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:08,032
Scott: That's not one of these three You're not really gonna get.

533
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:08,859
Scott: why it's awesome.

534
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:20,779
Rym: now I'm gonna warn you because there is a it's most like much like ghost in the shell where there was that Brain virus that affects like 1% of the population And then some small percentage of those people if they see the certain thing gets triggered by it.

535
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:30,220
Rym: Rogue like games are like that you might be one of those people who back in the day Would have spent all of college playing rogue and net hack and then eventually starve to death.

536
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:33,493
Scott: Yes, roguelike games are sort of weird in that you eat.

537
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:39,160
Scott: those people don't like them But a small subset of people love them to death.

538
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:39,722
Rym: Like.

539
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:44,680
Rym: we knew a couple people at RIT who played these games a lot and they were addicted to net hack.

540
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:48,605
Scott: They played net hack all the goddamn time Just constantly.

541
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:57,144
Rym: so if you play net hack or any of these games for more than about an hour Turn it off and post in our forums And we'll get you some help.

542
00:35:57,546 --> 00:36:01,726
Scott: or admit that you're one of those people and just start playing every roguelike game You can find cuz.

543
00:36:01,746 --> 00:36:06,097
Scott: yeah, there are a lot of them out there And if you like them you will not be an unhappy person.

544
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:12,663
Rym: also I know that because it's basically free to play these games and you can run them on a Fucking 386.

545
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:24,546
Scott: you could run them on like a 286 if you can install like an old like Linux kernel on there, so Theoretically you could work date like one-off jobs You know just enough to buy food.

546
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:27,740
Scott: people have Linux running on just about fucking everything these days, right?

547
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,000
Scott: Why don't they compile net hack for like the DS which runs Linux or the iPod or trans Linux or well?

548
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,414
Scott: I guess you need more buttons, but that's not the point.

549
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:36,440
Scott: it could be done.

550
00:36:38,144 --> 00:36:39,190
Rym: I don't think that's a good idea.

551
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,739
Rym: I don't think there's a great overlap between DS players and roguelike players.

552
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:50,932
Rym: Yeah, so anyway speaking of minimalist games Tonight we're gonna talk about something that may shock you.

553
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,940
Rym: we're going to talk about solitaire.

554
00:36:53,602 --> 00:37:01,686
Scott: Well, not just solitaire, but all the sorts of simple casual video games that Everyone and their mother plays.

555
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:13,248
Rym: really my mother plays these is about all she plays games like diner - and bookworm and freestyle and solitaire and Jezzball Random flash games like my mom.

556
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,636
Scott: you know gotten game my mom plays more than anything.

557
00:37:16,218 --> 00:37:16,980
Scott: It's the weirdest thing.

558
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,900
Scott: It's a flash game on some website and all it does is it shows you a bunch of letters, right?

559
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,280
Scott: It'll give you like seven letters, and then it says okay Spell every word that can be spelled using these letters.

560
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:39,500
Scott: So you have to spell every one letter word every two letter word every three letter word that can be spelled using that set Letters and once you get them all you're done and my mom plays that game a lot like she'll play it every day.

561
00:37:40,102 --> 00:37:51,538
Rym: Well the thing is a lot of gamers well a lot of I guess hardcore or too cool for school gamers Really dismiss these games despite the fact that a lot of people play them.

562
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:54,708
Scott: for one I don't think is that people they dismiss them well.

563
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:58,340
Scott: They just they just don't even really recognize or pay attention to them.

564
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:04,160
Scott: It's like you think okay You know what percentage of the population is our gamers, and you think okay?

565
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,800
Scott: Well, let's see there's this many teenage boys out there And I know a lot of 20 and 30 year olds are still playing games.

566
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:12,846
Scott: And there's this percentage of old men.

567
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:21,311
Scott: and you know there's these many girls out there with DS's and you come up with like the Stereotypical answer, but really a shit ton of people play video games.

568
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:25,240
Scott: the most popular video games are like Tetris on the cell phone.

569
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:35,609
Scott: You know Boggle on the internet boggle on you know backgammon on yahoo games Hearts on yahoo hearts yuker Cribbage bridge.

570
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,315
Rym: those things are stupidly popular.

571
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:44,286
Scott: Yeah, I mean, they're not actually Video games originally, but they're in video game form now And you know what those freaking count.

572
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:50,339
Rym: and a lot of them are straight up like diner - which was stupidly popular Was I'll just off flash game.

573
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:55,650
Scott: I mean if your grandpa doesn't has never played a video game in his life But he plays party poker.

574
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,200
Scott: guess what that's a video game.

575
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:58,488
Scott: He's now granted gamer.

576
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,419
Scott: your grandpa's a gamer if he plays party poker.

577
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:06,060
Rym: Granted you can still make the distinction because there is a difference between someone who plays games and someone who?

578
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,866
Rym: Self-identifies as a game.

579
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:11,499
Scott: there is of course yes, however people just don't seem to count.

580
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:18,719
Scott: Gamers at least don't seem to count people playing normal casual games that everyone plays as being a video game player.

581
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,953
Rym: now Why is this interesting?

582
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:20,439
Rym: well one?

583
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:25,117
Rym: Here's another little-known fact these games is where all the money is.

584
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:28,919
Rym: yeah Did you can make so much more money making some?

585
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,882
Rym: Stupid little flash game putting it on the internet with a little ad or maybe a link to pay five bucks to download the full Version.

586
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:39,016
Rym: then you ever will making the next Morrowind or oblivion or whatever.

587
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:39,760
Scott: yeah think about this.

588
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,919
Scott: Let's say you're I don't know you're a PC game company, and you make the new hot FPS.

589
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:47,548
Scott: It's the hottest FPS.

590
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,056
Scott: It's it's smashing right.

591
00:39:49,076 --> 00:40:03,813
Scott: you sell millions of copies for 40 bucks each right and then you split that money up among your Developers and it cost you millions of dollars to make the game in the first place And you'd the publisher takes a cut and all these people take a cut.

592
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:05,920
Scott: you still make a hardware in the servers.

593
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:08,169
Scott: You still make a smashing profit however.

594
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:11,060
Scott: You know I really gonna be rolling in it.

595
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,766
Rym: Yeah, I'm getting by well.

596
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:16,379
Rym: mostly the issue is you had a really high initial investment.

597
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:23,245
Rym: I'm a really high one and a chance of failure and a chance of very high Losses if the game fails.

598
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:28,339
Rym: and while you make a lot of money the margins are a lot narrower than you might think.

599
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:38,326
Scott: Meanwhile you can get one guy like me to sit down for a week Crank out a Tetris ish puzzly game for a cell phone once.

600
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:40,509
Scott: It's on that cell phone network say.

601
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:40,990
Scott: I don't know.

602
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:47,029
Rym: See how many people have cell phones just everyone and they you know they charge like a dollar or whatever.

603
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:49,737
Scott: today It's like 250 so 250 times.

604
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:50,459
Scott: I don't know.

605
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:56,291
Scott: 2 million people and it cost you a hundred bucks to make the game Ching.

606
00:40:56,872 --> 00:41:03,130
Rym: and there's a lot of these games, and you might not realize it especially if you're a cool leak hip too cool for school.

607
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,210
Rym: I said that twice gamer.

608
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,694
Rym: I don't know why.

609
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:11,085
Rym: I don't know why this in my head lately But those games are out there and a lot of people are playing them.

610
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,082
Rym: more people are playing those games That are playing your halo.

611
00:41:14,122 --> 00:41:14,970
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of scary.

612
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,873
Rym: I got a war.

613
00:41:16,114 --> 00:41:16,375
Rym: any

614
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:31,989
Scott: any game self-respecting gamer doesn't really care about cell phone games You know and any any smart person as far as I would say Wouldn't buy a cell phone game because they're horrendously overpriced And they're also usually my game virtual consoles almost a better deal than cell phone games.

615
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,479
Scott: The way they price those things some of them.

616
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:36,628
Scott: you even have to pay monthly for the cell phone games.

617
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:42,829
Scott: like you want to keep Tetris on your phone pay three dollars a month, and I'm like fuck no Paying three dollars a month for a crappy Tetris.

618
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:50,530
Rym: I got Tetris DS bitches my cell phone because I got this a long time ago And I'm loads to upgrade because it works pretty well and the battery lasts forever.

619
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:57,370
Rym: But it came with the probably the second worst pac-man port the world has ever seen.

620
00:41:57,691 --> 00:41:58,914
Scott: So it's worse than the Atari one.

621
00:41:59,115 --> 00:42:01,503
Scott: well second worst because it's are you all.

622
00:42:01,764 --> 00:42:02,546
Scott: I guess Atari 7800 pac-man is good.

623
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,119
Rym: Well, I'm sorry 7800 miss pac-man is straight up miss pac-man.

624
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,550
Rym: however Atari 2600 pac-man notoriously bad was an abortion.

625
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:23,570
Rym: Now alright so one day I ended up stuck somewhere without my DS and without any form of entertainment whatsoever And I was so bored that I turned on my cell phone.

626
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,401
Rym: I started playing this horrible ass pac-man that barely worked.

627
00:42:26,863 --> 00:42:37,045
Rym: I beat the first level then it said 250 to buy the next few levels and I said And I deleted it.

628
00:42:38,052 --> 00:42:45,185
Scott: And then I said there imagine how many stupid people pay that and imagine how much money you could make if you made that Game, and it was pre-installed on all those phones.

629
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:48,768
Rym: Yeah Yeah, now another interesting thing is that?

630
00:42:49,331 --> 00:43:01,047
Rym: Solitaire is probably the most well-known of these games because it was really from I'd say a lot of people in fact I might even posit the majority of human beings the first PC game.

631
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:01,649
Rym: They ever played.

632
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:03,333
Scott: Yeah, I'd say.

633
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:06,361
Scott: for most human beings out there solitaire might be the first.

634
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:13,639
Rym: if not solitaire then that whole genre of solitaire and/or Freestyle freestyle, what's the other one spider?

635
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:16,006
Scott: some people were freaking badass at spider?

636
00:43:16,066 --> 00:43:16,928
Scott: I can't play that game.

637
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:19,497
Scott: Yeah We were.

638
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:23,937
Rym: when I was a little kid I played the solitaire on the computer Because I was always.

639
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:30,549
Rym: yeah, it might be mine sweeper - it's hard to say but then again I think most people who aren't gamers went for the solitaire first because they knew what that was.

640
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,730
Rym: They didn't know what that mines me took me.

641
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,663
Scott: You know it took me like a couple days to learn how to play mine sweeper.

642
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:41,867
Rym: I figured it out Okay, kind of right away, and then one day like the third I was not.

643
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:46,050
Scott: if I read the help I would have learned sooner, but I refused to read the help the third time I played it.

644
00:43:46,151 --> 00:43:47,910
Rym: I was like I like I was looking at those numbers.

645
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:52,249
Rym: I'm like what the hell are those numbers again, and then I'm like wait a minute wait a minute.

646
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:55,035
Rym: oh This game's stupid.

647
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:56,942
Scott: No mine sweepers awesome.

648
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:57,985
Scott: I love mine sweeper.

649
00:43:58,005 --> 00:43:58,828
Scott: I'm basic.

650
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:06,789
Scott: the only problem I have with mine sweeper is that you know occasionally it comes down to you have to take a risk And it's just random whether you're gonna win or lose.

651
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:14,917
Rym: And if it doesn't come down to that then all you are doing is as a human being executing an algorithm very slowly Or very quickly if you're very good at it.

652
00:44:15,158 --> 00:44:18,170
Rym: I once beat a simple mine sweeper in seven seconds.

653
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,564
Scott: I've beaten a simple mine sweeper in five seconds because it was so easy.

654
00:44:21,584 --> 00:44:23,716
Scott: that was just like three bombs And I yeah every night.

655
00:44:23,757 --> 00:44:25,550
Rym: I get lucky like all the bombs are just one spot.

656
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:37,710
Scott: The worst is like there'll be a corner right and They'll just be three bombs surrounding the corner And you don't know if the corner has a bomb in it or not and you might or may not have to click it.

657
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:40,410
Rym: But here's what pissed me off to no end when I was a little kid.

658
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,910
Rym: I love card games, but I never ever played solitaire because I just I didn't like it.

659
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:45,641
Rym: I thought it was dumb.

660
00:44:46,027 --> 00:44:49,610
Rym: so Finally I was bored and I had a computer and I was doing everything on the computer.

661
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:53,710
Rym: So I learned how to play solitaire, and I was playing it, and I'm good at normal card games.

662
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:58,289
Rym: But I'd lose it solitaire sometimes and it bothered me a lot.

663
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:05,441
Rym: sometimes You just can't win and then one day my dad walks by and he sees me sitting there And I'm like I. I don't think I can win.

664
00:45:05,682 --> 00:45:06,345
Rym: I don't know what to do.

665
00:45:06,406 --> 00:45:07,029
Rym: I feel stupid.

666
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:11,571
Rym: my dad Is just like oh that one's unwinnable, and I'm like Unwinnable.

667
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:15,750
Rym: you mean that is pot that this game is set up to where you might just be fucked from the start.

668
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,380
Rym: And he says yeah, that's why I don't play solitaire.

669
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:22,893
Scott: Yeah, it's solitaire is basically just Solitaire.

670
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,099
Rym: you realize the solitaire.

671
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:25,849
Rym: They're like a thousand different solid.

672
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:34,200
Scott: well I mean technically that game where you jump the pieces over each other and then you know in trying to remove them all except one From the the plus shaped board, that's the.

673
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,983
Scott: that's a game.

674
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,529
Scott: That's actually just called solid.

675
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:42,130
Rym: well See people call a lot of different things solitaire, but the one on Windows is I believe Klondike solitaire.

676
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,659
Rym: Yes, there are a lot better solitaires out there.

677
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,442
Scott: There are many.

678
00:45:45,502 --> 00:45:47,730
Scott: I think free cell at least is definitely better than free cells.

679
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:57,489
Scott: Okay, yeah, but solitaire is basically just a game where if you have a deck of cards You can exercise your brain in a very slight way to pass the time.

680
00:45:57,509 --> 00:45:58,994
Scott: now Here's all the solitaires for now.

681
00:45:59,074 --> 00:46:14,370
Rym: interesting thing that a lot of the people I work on computers for I work with are not Technological like me their doctors or their lawyers or things like that And I usually show up to save the day or fix the problem or install the new switches in the closets.

682
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,977
Rym: They can get faster internet or whatever.

683
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:23,865
Rym: and the most common request I get after Can you uncensored the stupid internet for me god damn which?

684
00:46:24,065 --> 00:46:24,888
Rym: the answer is always no?

685
00:46:25,773 --> 00:46:27,509
Rym: I can't even uncensored for myself.

686
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:31,620
Rym: But right after that is can you put solitaire back?

687
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,710
Rym: cuz my company takes solitaire and minesweeper off of all the computers.

688
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,056
Rym: Everyone asks for it back.

689
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:42,269
Rym: people download spyware written solitaires on the internet because they just need their fix.

690
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:49,398
Rym: Wow, but to a lot of people don't realize the reason Solitaire was put in Windows originally.

691
00:46:49,418 --> 00:46:53,449
Scott: well there were actually two reasons one of which is a much bigger reason than the other.

692
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:59,185
Scott: yes when Microsoft Windows 3.0 came out people have been using DOS.

693
00:46:59,265 --> 00:47:04,385
Scott: people have been using God knows what until then you know people didn't know and there was Mac.

694
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:05,730
Scott: Oh Macintosh.

695
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:09,158
Scott: But really you know Macintosh was something else.

696
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:14,130
Rym: most people did not know how to use a mouse or they just were bad at It.

697
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:22,919
Rym: and I'd watch people young people not even like parents or grandparents who just couldn't understand the concept of click and drag or just Anything like.

698
00:47:22,939 --> 00:47:23,584
Rym: what's that for?

699
00:47:23,604 --> 00:47:24,310
Scott: there's a big deal.

700
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,719
Scott: I mean the first copy of Microsoft Word ever.

701
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,237
Scott: the first version came with a computer mouse Which is something that no one had.

702
00:47:31,297 --> 00:47:33,425
Scott: everyone had a computer with a keyboard nothing else.

703
00:47:33,485 --> 00:47:36,296
Scott: they might have heard old jokes about Joystick before they had a mouse.

704
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:39,550
Rym: you might have heard old jokes about people who thought the mouse was a foot pedal.

705
00:47:40,012 --> 00:47:41,999
Rym: That wasn't a fucking joke there.

706
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,367
Rym: that really happened more than once.

707
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:48,870
Scott: yeah I mean nowadays the mouse is a standard peripheral to the computer.

708
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:52,348
Rym: Imagine if God to me my mouse is literally.

709
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:57,202
Rym: well I guess not literally But it is as far as I can tell an extension of my brain and body.

710
00:47:57,503 --> 00:47:59,229
Rym: it is a force of will it is it?

711
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,956
Rym: Is an extension of all that I am?

712
00:48:01,036 --> 00:48:02,020
Rym: it is part of me when I'm.

713
00:48:02,061 --> 00:48:04,832
Scott: but imagine if new PCs started coming with a new Peripheral.

714
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:08,986
Scott: they came out with a I don't know a wiimote and you didn't let people.

715
00:48:09,026 --> 00:48:10,290
Scott: you know people never seen this.

716
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:13,339
Scott: All the computers started coming with them.

717
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,227
Scott: people aren't gonna know what to do with them, and they're gonna be all weirded out.

718
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:20,470
Scott: so Microsoft made solitaire which funnily it's enough.

719
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:28,050
Scott: You can play it with the keyboard if you know what you're doing and my cousin would always play with the keyboard because it was Faster, but you could play solitaire with the mouse.

720
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:34,754
Scott: It was intuitive to play with the mouse and it taught people how to double-click how to click and drag how to click one time.

721
00:48:35,156 --> 00:48:54,256
Scott: it taught you how to do all the basic mouse skills how to move the mouse with precision and You know it's something people wanted to do and you basically trick them into getting Comfortable and learning how to use a mouse on a computer without having to say you know here use the boring learn to use a Mouse program that no one cares about in

722
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:55,841
Rym: a were probably

723
00:48:56,343 --> 00:48:57,466
Scott: solely responsible.

724
00:48:57,506 --> 00:49:01,468
Scott: without solitaire Mount computer mice wouldn't be widespread today.

725
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:05,306
Scott: Computers who knows maybe I don't know it would be a scary world.

726
00:49:05,728 --> 00:49:06,812
Rym: in a word It was brilliant.

727
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:22,822
Rym: now the other thing that my solitaire the purpose that is served that was also equally important And I'm sure it was on the minds of the people who decided to put it in was that compared to previous computers people had had Solitaire showed off what a Windows computer could do.

728
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:25,250
Rym: you're dragging stuff around the screen.

729
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:32,016
Rym: There's graphics that you're dragging around in your computer not in some program It's in Windows in a window.

730
00:49:32,618 --> 00:49:41,490
Rym: and also when you beat solitaire there was this for the time Fancy graphical show where all the cards bounced off the screen one by one and people would sit there transfixed.

731
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:49,830
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty amazing when you actually saw I mean there were card games on computers before then But they were nothing like solitaire.

732
00:49:50,632 --> 00:49:52,162
Scott: Actually looked like cards.

733
00:49:52,283 --> 00:50:01,729
Rym: those people didn't know how to play them And this is right when PCs in the home started becoming actually prevalent and not just this weird Thing that like one or two some people had but not everyone.

734
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:02,211
Rym: yeah No, it was.

735
00:50:02,272 --> 00:50:06,370
Rym: it was becoming to where almost everyone had a computer or was planning to get a computer.

736
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:19,606
Scott: It was really kind of the beginning of the computer Mid to late 90s when it started to be everyone has a computer and everyone has a similar computer as opposed to hey those people Have a Commodore and those people have a ps1 and most people have nothing.

737
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:22,583
Scott: you know This was everyone's got a computer with the windows 3.1.

738
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:27,210
Rym: Oh shit That might have been a little short even though the show went on a little long.

739
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:39,789
Rym: I know we ranted a lot about a lot of things But the fact remains don't discount or ignore the simple crap games because those are The bread and butter of the world gaming industry right now.

740
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:45,110
Scott: Yeah, your video game magazines your video game blogs pretty much don't pay attention to this stuff at all.

741
00:50:45,431 --> 00:50:52,950
Scott: You know I mean if Yahoo Games suddenly upgrades their chess or their hearts or their spades No one's gonna really pay attention.

742
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,537
Rym: But well granted he's going live.

743
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:57,350
Rym: Xbox Live has Uno, and that's making all sorts of waves.

744
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:59,097
Scott: But if you log into Yahoo Games.

745
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:01,930
Scott: there are thousands of people playing hearts right now.

746
00:51:03,133 --> 00:51:04,888
Scott: That's more than a lot of MMOs.

747
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:07,383
Rym: Yeah, and you know what I really like hearts.

748
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:08,650
Scott: I really like hearts, too.

749
00:51:08,771 --> 00:51:10,670
Scott: I've played a lot of hearts on Yahoo Games.

751
00:51:12,558 --> 00:51:15,049
Rym: actually Scott and I are both really fucking good at hearts.

752
00:51:15,851 --> 00:51:19,006
Scott: I'm about as good as at hearts as I can be yeah.

753
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:26,823
Rym: Granted that as anyone could be but as I can be yeah, well, then there's people like my father who God Today, I can't beat him.

754
00:51:28,631 --> 00:51:35,757

755
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:50,110
Rym: pretty much the best way to get into the video game industry at least To start is to develop these crap little flash games and these crap little Java games and these crap little games For some little company trying to advertise something.

756
00:51:50,792 --> 00:52:07,627
Scott: Yeah, if you really want to learn how to be you know there are a lot of ways into the game industry be it by art testing direction management Programming, but if you want to get into Programming video games start out by making yourself like a Tetris in Python.

757
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:08,610
Scott: It's actually really easy.

758
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:09,670
