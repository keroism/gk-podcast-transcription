Rym: You got to break the illusion.

7
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:36,623
Scott: Yes.

8
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:38,550
Scott: You know I'm always the illusion breaker.

9
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:39,876
Scott: That is my job.

10
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,527
Scott: Whatever rims whenever Rym says oh my god.

11
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:44,535
Scott: It was so amazing I say it was all right.

12
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:46,824
Scott: and when Rym says oh my god.

13
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:48,170
Scott: I totally kicked this guy's ass.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,970
Scott: I'm like you pushed him over, and then he ran away, and you know that's how it.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,576
Scott: That's how it goes in this world.

16
00:00:54,178 --> 00:01:04,179
Scott: Rym is the hyperbole in the line and Scott is always your source of truth boring reality which is far more upsetting That you never seem to enjoy anything.

17
00:01:04,218 --> 00:01:06,347
Rym: and your response to pretty much any media.

18
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:12,921
Scott: We consume is hey Yeah, all the all the non is are from the past long ago.

19
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:15,007
Scott: Uh-huh trying to talk about Star Wars.

20
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:18,447
Scott: I will not go a. Really Star Wars is like 30 years old.

21
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:21,022
Scott: It's older than me.

22
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,683
Scott: That's more like 40 years old.

23
00:01:23,763 --> 00:01:23,884
Scott: good.

24
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:24,789
Scott: Yeah, all right.

25
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,438
Scott: Wow that that's really sad.

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,846
Scott: Star Wars is 40 years old.

27
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:29,650
Scott: It's like an old man.

28
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,986
Rym: So we're gonna do Thursday show I guess but the illusions broken.

29
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:36,929
Rym: I don't know if I can do it now.

30
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:43,090
Rym: Oh plus Scott doesn't the closer very specifically say GeekNights is actually recorded at night.

31
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:47,290
Scott: You know we would update the closer if someone wasn't so lazy.

32
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:50,761
Rym: I've been willing to do it a couple times But why don't we do it right now then?

33
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:52,049
Rym: because we have to write the script again.

34
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:56,210
Scott: Okay, cuz I remember the last time you should remove that part cuz the Sun is shining on my face.

35
00:01:56,411 --> 00:02:03,050
Rym: I remember the last time when we tried to rerecord it and you were like yeah We don't need to rewrite a script, and then it was just ah I don't remember.

36
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:06,004
Rym: This was many many months ago.

37
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:07,330
Scott: This was I don't think this happened.

38
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,710
Rym: This is when we first got the nice microphone because remember that was recorded with the old microphone.

39
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:15,702
Scott: No, I think we record re-recorded it afterwards.

40
00:02:15,823 --> 00:02:18,774
Rym: Yes, but if we took a couple of recordings Yeah, we did didn't.

41
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:22,827
Scott: and then we haven't tried again since we've just kept saying we should we anyway.

42
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:23,570
Scott: It doesn't matter.

43
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:27,576
Scott: so We're gonna do news whatever.

44
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:29,001
Scott: I guess not a thing a day.

45
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:30,105
Rym: We'd said ahead of time.

46
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:31,048
Rym: We weren't gonna do that.

47
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:31,550
Scott: all right.

Scott: Oh look grab Basically I don't have any show ideas.

54
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:45,445
Rym: all this means for me is that Scott has not been around.

55
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:51,043
Rym: he's been moving his stuff around and He dirtied up a bunch of my dishes and left him filthy in the kitchen rotting.

56
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:52,810
Scott: I did not use any of your dishes.

57

00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:41,130
Scott: I was being evil.

81
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:42,475
Scott: You know what I did.

82
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:43,358
Rym: What did you do?

83
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:46,348
Scott: well when I packed all my dishes to take them away, right?

84
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:55,119
Scott: I said haha I will clean everything that belongs to me and if it belongs to Rym even if I dirtied it well Fuck it because I'm just leaving it here great.

85
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,583
Scott: So yeah, I did.

86
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:57,386
Rym: that's nice.

87
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:00,782
Rym: I Love the fact Scott used one of my you.

88
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:02,009
Rym: I had a box from UPS.

89
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:04,269
Rym: I got a package from Michigan a while ago.

90
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:13,550
Rym: So Scott packs a bunch of his glasses into this box and then seals it up And then just leaves it out like I left it next to all this other stuff that was backed up Scott.

91
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,488
Rym: He was sitting on the table with all the mail.

92
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,410
Scott: It's pretty sure that I put it on the ground.

93
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,430
Rym: It was sitting on the table next to all the mail.

94
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,273
Rym: So I'm gonna mail.

95
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:27,353
Rym: I see this box and I'm like a box for me from Michigan from Chesterfield What the fuck.

96
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:31,010
Rym: and I'm trying to get my old band videos, so I'm thinking did they just mail them to me?

97
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,880
Rym: I didn't pay or anything yet.

98
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,690
Rym: What's going on here?

99
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,140
Rym: So I open it and I find all these bags packed in.

100
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,550
Rym: I open up the bags and I find all the Scott's teacups.

101
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,243
Scott: Yeah, I don't drink tea even.

102
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,710
Rym: why do you even have those teacups?

103
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,582
Scott: They came with a set of plates and you know bowls and things.

104
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,270
Rym: but why do you keep an unnecessary thing?

105
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,836
Rym: Are you ever gonna use them?

106
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:53,785
Scott: Well, you know people come over and use them.

107
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:54,950
Rym: What are they?

108
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,287
Rym: Do you don't even have any way to make tea?

109
00:04:58,092 --> 00:05:00,830
Scott: I'll probably get a teapot just cuz I need to make hot water occasionally.

110
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:03,789
Rym: Oh, do you use the hot water for you know for like.

111
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:07,504
Scott: you know, sometimes you need it for like a hot chocolate.

112
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:14,076
Scott: sometimes or You know, sometimes you just need to pour hot water on something Some ants.

113
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:16,510
Scott: if not, I don't think there's any ants on the third floor.

114
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:20,670
Rym: I don't think pouring hot water is gonna solve your end problem But yeah.

115
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:22,189
Scott: So I attempted to you know.

116
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:35,630
Scott: Normally you move in the one big go you put everything you own in a truck you drive it and you unpack it and it's I remember me and Pete had to drive that like 30 foot monster truck did not want to do that with its three speeds.

117
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,712
Rym: Oh my god, that was a nightmare 401k.

118
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:51,489
Scott: I thought I would be clever and I just I've been just driving my car back and forth you know with my stuff in it, you know and do a little bit at a time and it's taken me about a month and It's also sucks.

119
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:53,639
Scott: I mean it really.

120
00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:00,248
Scott: it doesn't suck in terms of like the hard work because in all honesty It's really not that hard in terms, you know, it's like I just unpacked a bunch of stuff.

121
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,561
Scott: yesterday I was surprised at how you know little more there is to do.

122
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:06,250
Scott: it sucks in sort of like the logistics way.

123
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:14,123
Scott: It's like okay You sort of the even though it's difficult to put your furniture in a truck then take it out of a truck and then put it in a building, you know, and it sucks.

124
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:21,389
Scott: cuz the thing is That is difficult And You can make it less difficult by paying movers a lot of money.

125
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:23,801
Rym: But that's my plan going forward.

126
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:28,929
Rym: if I weren't moving like around the corner Yeah, I would have just paid large men to do everything for me.

127
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:34,122
Scott: But it is logistically simple right you put your stuff you move your stuff.

128
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:35,685
Scott: You can understand what to do.

129
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:36,487
Scott: You just got to do it.

130
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,681
Scott: I Thought I'd be clever.

131
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:49,453
Scott: I was like, aha I'll buy all new furniture a new mattress new fucking everything almost all new everything I get in my chair down there somehow But almost all take it on the train Right.

132
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:52,749
Rym: Okay, so just put tie it up for the bikes go.

133
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:00,254
Scott: So I'm trying to do everything all You know like that.

134
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:03,664
Scott: the thing is logistics of it are far more difficult.

135
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:08,648
Scott: it's like, okay, so I gotta get this Delivered but I have to be there.

136
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:10,757
Scott: But it's a it's.

137
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:14,630
Scott: it's much more difficult in terms of what the hell should I do?

138
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,454
Rym: Gassy hiccups coming out.

139
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:18,300
Scott: I just I just ate lunch and whatnot.

140
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,387
Rym: So that's not a normal reaction to eating lunch.

141
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:28,430
Scott: regardless I'm gonna put my clothes in the car today and then I'm gonna come back here go to sleep go to work tomorrow And then I should be all set.

142
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:38,008
Scott: The only things that are left here are things which don't belong to me Things which I don't want anymore or things that we haven't determined what to do with you things You don't know what to do with or things that I don't really need.

143
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:43,855
Rym: Down in Queens luckily because we're being nice to our land the landlords people were living The place.

144
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,290
Rym: the people who own the place we're living in now, it's a pretty big house.

145
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,222
Rym: We've pretty much got this house until the end of the year.

146
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:50,789

00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:02,954
Rym: Yeah, we'll do that.

157
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,138
Rym: Maybe in December once the house is empty.

158
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:27,690
Rym: We kept saying we wanted to have a little like gaming convention.

159
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:29,056
Rym: We'll just have it in the house.

160
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:29,739
Rym: Yeah.

161
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,406
Scott: Yeah, I think we'll get in trouble.

162
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:32,230
Rym: How would we get in trouble?

163
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,719
Rym: I don't know if we're still paying rent.

164
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,284
Rym: It's our house.

165
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:35,110
Rym: We can do whatever we want.

166
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:37,190
Scott: I wonder if we're allowed to have a tag sale.

167
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:38,155
Scott: We should have a free sale.

168
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:39,503
Scott: We just put out stuff out in the long.

169
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:40,025
Scott: be like free.

170
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:40,489
Scott: come get this.

171
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:46,395
Rym: I think all we have to do is go to the beacon whatever and be like we want to have a garage sale Yeah, but I don't.

172
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:47,279
Scott: we should ask Mary.

173
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,050
Rym: I realize they don't seem to call them garage sales out here.

174
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:56,736
Scott: I think that's a more Midwestern thing where they call garage sale tag sale yard sale You know, they call them all sorts of things.

175
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,770
Rym: what I what's really weird what I never see around here are the basement sales.

176
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:02,419
Scott: No, they have a state sales.

177
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,309
Scott: Yeah, I never seen a basement sale ever.

178
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:11,847
Rym: Not only did I we do a basement sale a couple times Because it was people came into our house went into the basement and in the basement.

179
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,170
Rym: We set up a garage sale.

180
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:15,590
Scott: I've never seen a basement sale.

181
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:20,930
Rym: I was always weird going to basement sales though because you basically go into someone's house and it's their normal living house.

182
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:21,761
Rym: And one thing I can say.

183
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:31,927
Rym: People may or may not comment on how messy or neat, you know me and Scott or other people who live are From my experiences going to other people's houses as a child.

184
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:32,570
Rym: in the suburbs.

185
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,230
Rym: The vast majority of people fall into two camps.

186
00:09:35,752 --> 00:09:43,141
Rym: They either have the fake living room that no one actually uses full of knickknacks And then they like the hidden family room.

187
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:45,470
Rym: That's just a disaster where they actually do stuff.

188
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:53,812
Scott: Yeah well I mean like a lot of the people I knew like in Connecticut the style was you'd have a house with a bunch of rooms and a lot of the rooms would be.

189
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,340
Scott: some rooms would be clean and some rooms wouldn't like.

190
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:05,370
Scott: the basement would just be like this disaster or their their minivan would be Disaster and like, you know some of the you know bedroom like the kids bedroom would be disaster.

191
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:08,260
Scott: The parents bedroom be clean and then like one living.

192
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,322
Scott: the kitchen like one half the kitchen and the dining room Would be clean and the other half of the kitchen be a disaster.

193
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:22,928
Rym: and it's like they never clean the disaster parts But they kept the clean parts always clean But a lot of times the one the clean parts were the rooms that just never got used at all or the showrooms.

194
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:30,049
Rym: like when I first moved into you know, we got a big house in sterling heights as a kid So we had a. finally we had what all our relatives had a living room and a family room.

195
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:40,640
Rym: and What ended up happening was the family room was our normal living room and the living room was just this other living room with couches And a TV and everything that no one ever sat in.

196
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:43,810
Rym: it was just empty and full of knickknacks.

197
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:46,889
Rym: So then we turned that into a computer room and we moved everything around.

198
00:10:47,412 --> 00:11:04,129
Scott: Yeah, also a common pattern I saw was they would have like in the basement There'd be a TV and a couch and all that's where kids would go To go watch TV or play video games and then there'd be a real living room Which would be clean where you you know, they would all you know, the adults would sit and watch TV.

199
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:09,470
Rym: Yeah, but the other camp of people as far as I could tell they just lived in filth.

200
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:17,778
Rym: just the level of mess not even just mess like there's stuff laying around but like Stacks of pizza boxes.

201
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,550
Scott: Yeah, I think that the thing is is that You know, it's like there's a certain level, you know, there are people that are super clean.

202
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:24,852
Scott: There's.

203
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:27,289
Scott: you know, there's a whole range of people and how clean they are.

204
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:32,433
Scott: But I think that the people who are super clean, I think there's an event horizon They don't really.

205
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:37,630
Scott: they never you know, they'll find someone who's sort of middling clean and they'll be like, oh my god is terrible.

206
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:51,049
Scott: It's like they haven't seen the really terrible because that's the kind of person that they're never gonna interact with ever and then they're never Gonna go to that person's house and they're never gonna see how bad it really can be and then won't Understand how the medium clean person is actually really clean.

207
00:11:52,432 --> 00:12:03,705
Scott: It's like unless you go to a lot a lot of people's houses You're not really gonna sort of you know figure out like, you know who you know How many people are and that'd be actually a good really good scientific study.

208
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:15,261
Scott: if you would census Ask you if the census would just like sort of evaluate how clean people's houses are and they could be like 10% of how Houses we would classify as uber clean and uber.

209
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:21,750
Scott: Eh, yeah, like, you know uber clean is like, you know Old lady with plastic on the couch, you know in China in a cabinet.

210
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,630
Rym: Can you imagine the shitstorm the Republicans would raise if the census workers came in to look around your house?

211
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,021
Rym: Just asking you questions.

212
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:34,504
Scott: Yeah They would just peak, you know They would be the judgment from looking in the windows in the front door that could be.

213
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:34,986
Rym: because what if?

214
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:35,870
Rym: what if it's like the serial?

215
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:42,690
Rym: Killer with the nice exterior and the nice like anteroom or the nice soft foyer and then inside bodies everywhere.

216
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:43,556
Scott: That's fine.

217
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,830
Scott: You know that at least you're doing some cleaning.

218
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:50,810
Scott: It's like, you know, they think you could tell from I think, you know the front few rooms.

219
00:12:51,434 --> 00:13:00,670
Rym: how what amazes me is the surprising number of people who Kind of passed that event horizon of cleanliness to where they just stop like using the toilet or they just stop.

220
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:07,241
Scott: You can see those on the Internet's blot of them, you know, like the guy poops and jars or the guy He just never throws anything out.

221
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:08,570
Scott: So the house is just a pile of trash.

222
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,510
Rym: It's such a common thing like there was one recently on Farg.

223
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:16,556
Rym: I found where a dude literally like his neighbors called the police cuz they thought he died Really?

224
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:17,490
Scott: He just smelled so bad.

225
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,961
Rym: He just smelled so bad because the apartment was just full of garbage.

226
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:26,858
Rym: and the thing is is for everyone who talked to him He was basically Completely sane and there was nothing you could really like.

227
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,170
Rym: you couldn't arrest him for being insane except that his apartment was disgusting.

228
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,521
Scott: Well, you could say it's an environmental hazard.

229
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,345
Rym: I think they evicted him.

230
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:38,510
Rym: Yeah All right, yeah, so it's Thursday.

231
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:42,602
Rym: Okay, we got a. really I feel now like there's a big change.

232
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:47,237
Rym: we're moving around in our lives and everything and sometime next week We'll have the you know state of the podcast.

233
00:13:47,257 --> 00:14:01,470
Rym: cuz all you punk kids are like panicking about geek dies going away even though it's not uh-huh, but I Feel like we said way back We're gonna make Thursday different and we really we'd always like pointedly try to make Thursday different and more loose didn't fail.

234
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:04,643
Rym: And then we'd always like like we do one like yeah, we didn't do news.

235
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:05,808
Rym: We just talked about fun stuff.

236
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:06,370
Rym: It was Thursday.

237
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:12,127
Rym: Yeah, then the next Thursday We'd be sitting here with show like there's fucking no news and we just like pick news and talk about stuff.

238
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:12,669
Rym: We didn't care about.

239
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:14,393
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

240
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:27,050
Scott: Maybe we should you know, if we're gonna maybe not record at night or maybe we'll probably still record at night Cuz that's when we're home from work, but I mean, you know, maybe we should change our format something I don't know not just Thursday.

241
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,923
Rym: All we have to do is go back to what we kept saying.

242
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:29,810
Rym: We're gonna make Thursday.

243
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,376
Rym: It's Thursday was the free format.

244
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,704
Rym: Thursday was the the lounge.

245
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:34,246
Scott: Yeah.

246
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:35,250
Scott: Well, we'll see.

247
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:39,324
Scott: Anyway, so do we want to things of the day, right?

248
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,408
Rym: Yeah, we got some things of the day.

249
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:48,358
Rym: Okay So things of the day.

250
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:57,170
Rym: I hate to go to just a college humor But more and more I realize you guys the only website you look at with funny stuff Not only that you guys as far as I can tell don't go to college humor.

251
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,346
Scott: It's not weird that it's like college humor is a filter of internet videos.

252
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:00,949
Scott: It's pretty good.

253
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,079
Scott: But now we're like a filter of a filter.

254
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,189
Rym: Yeah, I don't know where you people find funny things on the internet.

255
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:12,510
Scott: You know, actually I think that it's sort of you know, if you look at a lot of filter sites, right?

256
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,268
Scott: It's basically the way they work.

257
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,721
Scott: is They just anything they see?

258
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:17,286
Scott: that's sort of.

259
00:15:17,406 --> 00:15:19,436
Scott: you know Whoever the filter is likes.

260
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:22,749
Scott: they put it up and some days there might be a lot and sometimes they might be a little.

261
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:29,710
Scott: I Think a better way to make a filter Would be that at the end of the day you have to put up X thing.

262
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,969
Scott: No, you can you limit it to X things?

263
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:40,570
Scott: So it's like even if there were ten great things you only can put up three and that way I Think there's at least three good enough things on the internet every day, right?

264
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:42,868
Scott: So if you limit yourself to just like three a day.

265
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:47,646
Scott: Then this thing your filter is gonna be really good and you might miss something, but you know what?

266
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:49,974
Scott: It's like come on There's enough I don't need.

267
00:15:50,295 --> 00:15:52,342
Rym: I'm gonna have a big problem come November.

268
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:56,112
Rym: I'm too used to having my daily Cinemassacre.

269
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:57,398
Scott: Oh, I know right.

270
00:15:57,418 --> 00:16:04,184
Rym: It's like the only thing I can rely on in my life right now Is that every day I get a cinemasker and I could see some horribly violent old bloody movie.

271
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:06,070
Scott: add some and some more webcomics.

272
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:08,889
Rym: It's hard to find new good webcomics.

273
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:14,050
Scott: You know the thing is every time I find a good new webcomic I forget to add it to my webcomic bookmark folder.

274
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,789
Scott: But now I just installed a clean OS.

275
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,601
Scott: I'll be redoing my webcomic book more than once.

276
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,950
Rym: I'll find a new webcomic and I like oh, this is great.

277
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:29,930
Rym: And then I'd like go through the archives and I get up to the recent one and I realize it's the same one I looked at when I first found the webcomic and I find out it's not updating anymore.

278
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:31,738
Scott: Yeah, I mean likely this every day.

279
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,510
Scott: I basically go to you know, my comics folder.

280
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,424
Scott: I open it in tabs and then I'll manually go to like xkcd later.

281
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:40,968
Scott: It's like just when I remember to.

282
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:43,259
Scott: it's like Why don't I add it to the thing?

283
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:44,867
Rym: You know, I'm even worse.

284
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:45,510
Rym: I've gotten to the point.

285
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,769
Rym: I really only read penny arcade vg cats xkcd and oots.

286
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:51,634
Scott: You're not reading.

287
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:51,895
Scott: Dr.

288
00:16:51,935 --> 00:16:52,376
Scott: McNinja.

289
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:52,858
Rym: Dr.

290
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:53,200
Rym: McNinja.

291
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,605
Rym: I don't even have to say that's just a given.

292
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:57,878
Rym: I dr McNinja is not.

293
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:03,783
Rym: very few things on this earth have ever so Coincided with my humorous aesthetic as dr.

294
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:04,244
Rym: McNinja.

295
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:12,162
Rym: Pulp fiction with a laugh track.

296
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:13,006
Scott: Oh, yeah.

297
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:13,407
Scott: I saw this.

298
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:13,790
Rym: It's good.

299
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:18,233
Rym: The reason I use this is that we're trying to watch Seinfeld again.

300
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:21,925
Rym: and really didn't people in the forum keep trying to get us to watch these TV shows?

301
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:26,220
Rym: and I just Cannot watch a show with a laugh track anymore.

302
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,267
Rym: It is it is unwatchable laugh.

303
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:29,090
Scott: Yeah, it's weird.

304
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:40,411
Scott: It's like I used to watch TV like up until I was like 18 years old I watched a lot of TV as much as a couch potato, but you know a few hours a day I would watch TV a lot of cartoons Seinfeld.

305
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:45,110
Rym: so so I realized in America if you sit around and watch too much TV, you're a couch potato.

306
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,030
Rym: Yeah, if you wander around space with a gun, you're a space potato.

307
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,120
Scott: Why are you space potato lazy?

308
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,683
Rym: Matsumoto?

309
00:17:53,569 --> 00:18:03,479
Scott: Oh Okay, so Yeah, the thing is I didn't really notice laugh tracks then after like years of not watching TV really much at all.

310
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:13,130
Scott: and Then the only times I really watch TV is like live sports Which don't have laugh tracks like I went batch to watch back to watch Seinfeld again more recently, you know.

311
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,738
Scott: And the laugh track it's like really stands out like a sore thumb.

312
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:22,149
Rym: It is incredibly painful Like ads and everything.

313
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:33,600
Rym: like when I stopped watching TV and then you know I came back to home in Michigan for like a week after I'd been at college for like months and months with no TV and TV was on and I was kind of doing something kind of an edge to it.

314
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,512
Rym: Then the ads happened and I just couldn't deal with it.

315
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:37,919
Scott: Well, I was waiting for the cable guy.

316
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:42,174
Scott: yesterday I watched the Simpsons treehouse of horror on Hulu right with the stolen wireless.

317
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:44,042
Rym: not as good as it used to be it was.

318
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:55,440
Scott: it was you know average ish, but the It was definitely not as good as you know, some of the the best of them But I have the shit in there was like there was like a commercial.

319
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,440
Scott: It was only one commercial but like in the middle of the episode, it's just a gut commercial.

320
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,990
Scott: I'm like what the fuck it's like.

321
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:00,876
Scott: it totally threw me off.

322
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:06,765
Rym: Anyway, so Pulp Fiction with a laugh track This is how one is.

323
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:09,151
Scott: look how the laugh track changes.

324
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:15,360
Scott: Pulp Fiction now, you know and for you know humorous But also negative effect depending on your point of view.

325
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,840
Rym: But I guess the way you might feel watching this is how I feel like watching any show with a laugh track.

326
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,098
Rym: It's just like what's going on?

327
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,050
Rym: Of course independently that show that people kept.

328
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,592
Rym: what was the show?

329
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:26,700
Rym: they kept trying to get us to watch about the geeks?

330
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:28,005
Scott: I don't know.

331
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:34,077
Scott: I just know that there was some TV show That was just a crappy sitcom where all the proper nouns were nerd proper nouns.

332
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:34,478
Rym: Yeah.

333
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:42,720
Scott: Yeah It's like come on if you actually you know At least like the arrested development was actually somewhat of an original show and wasn't following the standard sitcom formula.

334
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,090
Rym: Yep, and it was actually pretty funny steeple steeple.

335
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:47,434
Scott: Okay touching.

336
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:48,457
Rym: Okay.

337
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:51,405
Scott: Okay My thing of the day, right?

338
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,152
Rym: Yeah fast and loose here.

339
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:55,000
Rym: It's like fast karate for the GeekNights.

340
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:59,020
Scott: It's what happens when we're going during the day and we're not freaking tired as all hell.

341
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:04,178
Rym: Yeah, plus we haven't you know, Scott's been doing moving and stuff and I was working in the night shift.

342
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:06,759
Rym: all last week We actually haven't talked.

343
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,672
Rym: We're at length for like a week.

344
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,400
Scott: We're refreshed now.

345
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:18,158
Rym: Scott would come home from work and I'd be like getting ready to go to work and then he'd like go to Queens.

346
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:23,509
Scott: and uh anyway, the There's always all sorts of awesome stuff made out of Lego.

347
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,935
Scott: big things nerdy.

348
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,340
Rym: I believe you mean Lego bricks.

349
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:28,647
Scott: No, Lego is plural.

350
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,275
Rym: No, it's Lego bricks.

351
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:35,193
Scott: anyway Lego is the polar of Lego regardless.

352
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:39,229
Scott: This dude made a pop-up book out of Lego.

353
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:39,369
Scott: Now.

354
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:40,734
Scott: It's not a whole pop-up book.

355
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:50,628
Scott: It only has one quote page but basically it's a. it's a rectangular box of Lego, but you can open it up and when you do a Castle comes out.

356
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:52,680
Scott: It's kind of crazy and awesome.

357
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:58,197
Scott: you can't really understand how it works until you see the video of it and then you'd be like, oh I get it.

358
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,200
Scott: and Just like thinking about how the dude made this thing.

359
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,876
Scott: It's like I can't even like begin to even a man like where would you start like?

360
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:07,840
Scott: I haven't oh my god.

361
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,885
Scott: So it's.

362
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:15,597
Scott: it's pretty amazing one of the best Lego things I've seen probably like top five at least of Lego things ever.

363
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:18,076
Scott: so You should probably see it.

364
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:20,271
Scott: It's a video on the internet and it's nice.

365
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:28,340
Scott: the video actually, you know Replays the transformation sequence over and over slowly from all kinds of angles so you can really see what's going on here.

366
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,755
Scott: Yeah, as opposed to being like, huh?

367
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:31,278
Scott: What the fuck?

368
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:40,467
Rym: Okay, so We kind of delayed purposefully now building up to this because people have been bugging me for this story Since I tweeted about.

369
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:43,360
Scott: I don't think I've even heard the whole whole story with details.

370
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:47,353
Scott: Of course, I will be challenged as we discussed the meaning of the show.

371
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:53,075
Scott: I will be challenging your hyperbole Although the problem is I was not there so I do not.

372
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:55,956
Scott: I do not know the truth So I cannot protect people from.

373
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:03,593
Rym: I have the pictures of Everything I could take pictures of and the evidence and the chain and everything of all the.

374
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:05,681
Rym: I've all this physical evidence to back It up.

375
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:08,232
Rym: that's pretty good including the fact that I got my bike back.

376
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:08,774
Scott: Yep.

377
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:09,818
Scott: Where is it?

378
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:10,300
Scott: I haven't seen it.

379
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,910
Rym: It's an Emily's place cuz I can't ride it.

380
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,620
Rym: the jackass like cut up the seat.

381
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,688
Rym: I don't know how you could sit on it.

382
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,863
Rym: It was like if anyway Up the seat.

383
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:18,264
Rym: Yeah.

384
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:18,445
Rym: Yeah.

385
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:25,416
Rym: Well, I mean the reason Scott didn't hear the story was that everyone came over because we were going to The awesome the geeky wedding of cat and Steve.

386
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:25,860
Rym: Mm-hmm.

387
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,700
Rym: So everyone was like meeting at our house and then all going to the wedding but everyone came at different times.

388
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:35,260
Rym: So people came and they're like, oh my god the bike.

389
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,438
Rym: So I told the story of the bike and then more people came and then someone would be like, yeah I remember telling the story about the bike.

390
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:48,002
Rym: I tell the story again and then more people came and more people came and then finally like I think Nuri and Pete and Scott Are back.

391
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,747
Rym: So I go.

392
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:54,040
Rym: I start to tell the story and then like we got distracted by something that we all went to the wedding.

393
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:57,498
Rym: Yep, so I didn't actually tell the story to the rest of those people.

394
00:22:58,101 --> 00:22:59,769
Rym: Uh-huh, though to my credit.

395
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,000
Rym: I had to tell the story so many times.

396
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:07,600
Rym: The fact that it was consistent among all those tellings is a tiny bit of evidence for the fact that it is in fact true.

397
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:23,280
Scott: I'm not denying the truth of the story by I'm shy but I I know and I will assume that various details that sound Hyperbolic, you know, there will be much exaggeration of small things even though the story as a whole will probably be very accurate.

398
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:25,088
Scott: It will not be precise.

399
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:25,731
Rym: I can be perfect.

400
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:26,616
Rym: I will be 100% precise.

401
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:30,897
Rym: In fact, I'll make an effort to not in any way exaggerate a moment of it.

402
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:36,116
Rym: Uh-huh So to begin the party failed right there to begin that.

403
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:36,918
Rym: that's that.

404
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:37,440
Rym: that's fine.

405
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:42,815
Rym: To begin the fable of how Rym God's it really a fable.

406
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:43,537
Scott: Is there a moral?

407
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:44,680
Rym: I think there is a moral.

408
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,090
Scott: It can't be a fable that immoral.

409
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,613
Rym: There's a moral.

410
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:47,540
Rym: This is a GeekNights fable.

411
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,531
Rym: We haven't done one of these in like two years.

412
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:56,478
Scott: lion in the in the mouse You know leave the thumbtack in the line Got his motherfucking bike back.

413
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:58,505
Rym: So I was.

414
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:02,540
Rym: I was walking home from the train station and Thor appeared and Thor was like Rym.

415
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:12,378
Rym: I just wanted to tell you you're like the coolest dude ever All right, so I'd stayed in the city late.

416
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:19,960
Rym: We're out to hang out with like you going enough and everybody, you know All our friends that we don't get to see a lot even though they live in Brooklyn now like right there.

417
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,110
Rym: but that's just cuz.

418
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:26,420
Rym: they're busy and we're busy and Emily had to stay in the city to use a work computer to do some Japanese lesson thing.

419
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:29,791
Rym: So I took like two trains earlier home than she did.

420
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:30,433
Rym: Mm-hmm.

421
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,500
Rym: So I get home at like 10 o'clock.

422
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,463
Rym: It's super late.

423
00:24:33,885 --> 00:24:35,250
Rym: my car is still busted.

424
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,992
Rym: It was cold.

425
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:38,160
Rym: I didn't bring my rollerblades the train station or anything.

426
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:39,960
Scott: You just walk to Emily's house and sleep.

427
00:24:40,402 --> 00:24:46,235
Rym: So I was gonna walk to Emily's house and basically just fall asleep and wait for her to get home and then I don't know Eat some food or something because I was hungry.

428
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:46,699
Rym: Mm-hmm.

429
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:49,073
Rym: But and I'm walking up from the train station.

430
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:53,878
Rym: and you know behind the train station There's like that like there's the sidewalk up and then over the bridge.

431
00:24:53,898 --> 00:25:01,441
Rym: Yep So I'm walking back over there and that's where my bike was originally stolen from the bike lock area over there Mm-hmm.

432
00:25:01,963 --> 00:25:11,599
Rym: So every time I would walk past that I would always kind of look at the bike lock area like Just in case my bike was there.

433
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:14,100
Rym: Obviously, it was never there.

434
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,700
Rym: I mean what kind of thief is stupid enough to put the bike where he stole it from?

435
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:21,880
Scott: Usually a bike thief just sort of sells it or gets rid of it or takes it far away.

436
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:26,439
Scott: I mean you would have to be a real moronic bike thief to like park it where you stole it from.

437
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:28,065
Rym: Well, well, we'll sell.

438
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:29,430
Rym: well, we'll see where this goes.

439
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:45,482
Rym: So I'm tired and as I'm walking up the sidewalk I see a bike chained like crazy chain like two Lengths of thick chain to a tree like two and a half football fields up from where the bikes are normally locked up by Itself.

440
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:46,125
Rym: Mm-hmm.

441
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:53,948
Rym: And as I walk by I've already done the So, I don't think to do that again, I just keep walking.

442
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:56,497
Rym: I'm like hey bike hey kind of looks like my bike.

443
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:05,640
Scott: hey Was my bike Great, someone stole a bike and then crazy chained it to a tree.

444
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:08,760
Rym: Well, obviously they're afraid it was gonna get stolen.

445
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:13,575
Scott: I can see how you would be afraid is gonna get stolen if you know how easy it is to sell.

446
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:15,298
Rym: done cuz there's bike thieves about.

447
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:18,225
Rym: but no For a second.

448
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,280
Rym: I'm looking at it and I'm like, is this my bike?

449
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:26,420
Rym: I can't really tell because it's got electrical tape all over it and it's got a different seat on it.

450
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:28,317
Rym: So I'm standing here like looking at it.

451
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:31,713
Rym: But the serial number on the front is the same serial number like.

452
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:32,336
Rym: it's the same.

453
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:33,400
Scott: You had a serial number.

454
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:39,519
Rym: Yeah, all right I'm not gonna say it on the air but it has a four-digit serial number stamped onto a badge on it.

455
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:40,603
Rym: This is back.

456
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:42,028
Rym: Remember this bike is so old.

457
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,557
Rym: This is when Schwinn had the lifetime warranty.

458
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:47,911
Rym: to this day I can take that bike to any Schwinn dealer.

459
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:50,543
Scott: I know there's a lot less Schwinn now, you know it's like now.

460
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:56,186
Scott: it's all like Trek and Cannondale and oh Specialized I feel like the Kings.

461
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:57,794
Scott: now Schwinn is sort of disappeared.

462
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,000
Rym: Ah, they're still around.

463
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:03,320
Scott: Obviously, they're still around but I'm saying that the other brands of biker now in the front.

464
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,595
Rym: So I could do a whole show on what happened with Schwinn.

465
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:17,120
Rym: the short story I could tell you is that Schwinn started making bikes for People like Walmart and they started making lower quality like lower end bikes in addition to their high-end bikes.

466
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,717
Scott: I just read this great article talking about the croc shoes and it basically was the same thing.

467
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:22,660
Scott: is that croc shoes?

468
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,578
Scott: You know they were around and they were sort of like, you know, it's this indestructible foam.

469
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:30,440
Scott: personally I think the shoes look stupid, but you know people were interested in them.

470
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:34,280
Scott: The thing that the mistake they made was that they expanded so quickly.

471
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:43,980
Scott: It was like this thing that you could only buy in certain places and was sort of special and they made it completely Non-special by producing a bajillion of them and selling them in every fuck store.

472
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:44,886
Rym: But that was brilliant.

473
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:45,671
Rym: because look what happened.

474
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:46,616
Rym: They did that now.

475
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:48,780
Rym: Oh because they screwed it up.

476
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:56,680
Rym: What you're supposed to do is once you have that fad boom like as soon as the fad boom starts Stop production because it's going to stop within three months and you'll be done.

477
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:03,229
Scott: See but what you could know see the better idea that is that is a good idea is to just ride the fad and then Stop as soon as the fad is over.

478
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,260
Rym: That's all I want because I want to have money.

479
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:15,420
Scott: I don't want to be making money to have money But the correct business strategy is to you keep it so that you can only buy them in a few select places And you don't flood the market with supplies.

480
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:27,776
Scott: so they remain sort of this hot item and that's what determines the difference between a fad and You know like like an icon I'd rather rather have the fad because then the fad I just basically I say you're only.

481
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:28,720
Scott: are you looking for money?

482
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,624
Scott: Are you looking for King?

483
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:32,340
Rym: I'm looking for money so I can become King in a different arena.

484
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:33,600
Rym: Do you want to be the croc King?

485
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,928
Scott: Those guys did and they fail.

486
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,638
Rym: Yeah, cuz you don't want to be the croc King.

487
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:40,639
Scott: Yeah Anyway, maybe the crocodile now neither the croc pop.

488
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:45,348
Rym: So it's clearly my bike.

489
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,719
Rym: but here here's what the dude has done.

490
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:56,000
Rym: one He is wrapped black electrical tape around different parts of the frame in some like sad attempt to disguise the bike.

491
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,520
Scott: I like the electrical tape look but I mean, you know not for disguising.

492
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:08,500
Rym: He's covered up part of the Schwinn thing and you know I have those like mountain bike handlebar things on the top like stick out the front.

493
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,043
Rym: Yep, he put duct tape on those two and then electrical tape till I cover it all up to make the bike look different Mm-hmm.

494
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:15,873
Rym: He also the seat.

495
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:16,899
Rym: I had that seat on it.

496
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:26,500
Rym: yep, he cut all this like fabric of the seat off cuz it was a very distinctive like orthopedic kind of seat and Cut it down to like the bare structure to make it look different.

497
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:29,432
Rym: Basically, it was expensive.

498
00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:29,975
Rym: It was like an $80 seat.

499
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,480
Rym: Yeah, so he basically ruined the thing and did all this other like dumb stuff to the bike to disguise it.

500
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,371
Rym: But he was unable to fully disguise it.

501
00:29:39,412 --> 00:29:41,520
Rym: He did not cover the entire frame in electrical tape.

502
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:50,588
Rym: He put like one two foot length of tape wrapped around like one part of the frame and then another like foot and a half length of Electrical tape supposed to do the whole thing.

503
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,357
Scott: That's what makes it look cool with the.

504
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:56,554
Rym: I don't know If he just couldn't afford enough electrical tape or what guys.

505
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,280
Scott: he couldn't afford a bike but even better.

506
00:29:58,621 --> 00:30:03,999
Rym: He like wrapped around like the front before and after where my water bottle thing is.

507
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:08,319
Rym: Yeah, but he didn't wrap around the water bottle thing, but that's where the big Schwinn logo was.

508
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:14,300
Rym: And he cut the water bottle thing like he was trying to remove it from the bike but it failed.

509
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:20,660
Rym: Like he literally like I can see he must have hacksawed through it a couple times, but he couldn't quite get it off.

510
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:21,625
Rym: So he gave up.

511
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:23,736
Rym: I guess he didn't have an allen wrench.

512
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:26,627
Scott: Yeah, right I was he not a bike person?

513
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:29,260
Scott: if he doesn't have an allen wrench, so he's also not an IKEA person.

514
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,379
Rym: So I'm standing here looking at my bike double chain with the super thick chain and two locks.

515
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:38,693
Rym: Two locks that had a key lock and a combination lock.

516
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:40,540
Rym: good ones like high-quality ones.

517
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:43,040
Scott: Well, you can afford good locks, but he can't afford electrical tape.

518
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:45,478
Rym: So I'm standing here looking at my bike thinking what the fuck?

519
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,632
Rym: So I lives no way to get the bike off the tree like this.

520
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:49,940
Rym: There's no way I'm cut the tree down.

521
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:50,850
Rym: I don't have any.

522
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:53,294
Scott: just call Called the policeman like.

523
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:53,899
Scott: this is my bike.

524
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:57,640
Rym: I never actually told the police like the bike was stolen cuz I never expected to get it back.

525
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:58,403
Scott: Oh, that was.

526
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:00,452
Scott: I would have report it anyway just for the sake of it.

527
00:31:00,753 --> 00:31:02,480
Scott: Yeah, it's in on the file.

528
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:05,212
Rym: Yeah, I might report it later just to get it, but I don't care.

529
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:06,820
Rym: so I'm standing there.

530
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,048
Rym: It's like what the fuck am I gonna do?

531
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:12,574
Rym: and even if I call the police It's like 11 o'clock at night in Beacon unless I call 9-1-1.

532
00:31:12,594 --> 00:31:17,380
Rym: There's gonna be no police coming Mmm, and are they gonna come with like a side cutter or something?

533
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:20,150
Scott: You can just get a bolt cutter, you know clink plus.

534
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:29,340
Rym: while I knew the serial number of the bike We could have gone to Home Depot and gotten one I no longer had like the Documentation like I could not have easily proven that it was actually my bike.

535
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,020
Scott: Do we have photos of you with the bike somewhere?

536
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:32,642
Rym: Yeah, we could dig those up But it would have.

537
00:31:32,984 --> 00:31:36,850
Rym: it would have been time consuming and I would have had to convince the police right then to cut the bike Down and give it to me.

538
00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:39,411
Rym: Mmm With or without a police report.

539
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:45,016
Rym: It might not have been that easy Mmm, so also my phone because I hadn't charged it in two days not a battery.

540
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:45,799
Scott: Yeah, good job.

541
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,939
Scott: Mr Never charges the phone never even picks up the phone even if it is charged.

542
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:51,284
Scott: So what's the point of having it?

543
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:53,051
Rym: Cuz I I don't use the phone.

544
00:31:53,071 --> 00:31:56,673
Rym: I use it as it's a portable internet device that happens To be able to call people.

545
00:31:56,795 --> 00:32:06,169
Rym: Yeah So I'm standing there thinking all right, I cannot leave this spot lest the jackass come and take the bike Mm-hmm, but I haven't figured out what to do yet.

546
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,073
Rym: So I'm looking around.

547
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,760
Rym: I don't see anyone like around.

548
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:11,820
Rym: I'm debating like should I just wait for Emily to come home?

549
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,379
Rym: But what if she walks out the other way from the train station?

550
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:22,079
Rym: Yeah, as I'm standing there this large african-american gentleman comes up behind me and says can I help you?

551
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:24,332
Rym: And he's about.

552
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:27,629
Rym: he's not quite a foot taller than me But he's a full head taller than he.

553
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:32,249
Scott: just wait this guy just walks up to you and as if he can help you Just when you're just standing there.

554
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:35,060
Rym: Yeah, I'm standing in front of this bike like looking at the bike.

555
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,940
Rym: I'm like examining the bike because I'm still also thinking I'm sure this is my bike, right?

556
00:32:40,601 --> 00:32:46,459
Rym: I'm sure cuz I because I remembered that four-digit number But I wasn't a hundred percent sure cuz it's been so long since I've looked at that number.

557
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:52,718
Rym: So I'm like, there's no way this isn't my bike who has an orange Schwinn from 15 years ago and bacon?

558
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:53,380
Scott: nobody.

559
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,200
Rym: So.

560
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:57,256
Rym: and then I back up and I'm like looking at the bike like alright, what do I do?

561
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:57,920
Rym: and the guy comes up?

562
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,714
Rym: He's like, can I help you?

563
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:06,678
Rym: So I look at him and he is he is has the look of someone who's gonna give me some trouble and I am sure This is the guy who stole my bike.

564
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:12,500
Rym: He has not figured out yet that I that this is my bike and I have full knowledge.

565
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,342
Scott: Mmm,

566
00:33:13,923 --> 00:33:30,192
Rym: I have my cell phone still in my hand because the battery was dead and I determined this fact when I went to turn It on to call someone And as I know, you know why it was dead because I used it the entire way home on the train looking at the internet With the pilot one bar of evdo.

567
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:31,359
Scott: Yeah, you should not do that.

568
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:38,848
Rym: So I look at him and you know, he has asked this question and before you give me any trouble I just say this is my fucking bike.

569
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:41,799
Rym: It was stolen from the train station like a month ago.

570
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,044
Rym: I can't believe.

571
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:48,519
Rym: I found it here and I kind of turned my back to him for a second Like I you know, like I don't know it's him.

572
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,513
Rym: And then I turned back and like and I had my phone in my hand.

573
00:33:51,553 --> 00:33:52,800
Rym: I'm like, yeah, I called the police.

574
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,637
Rym: I'm just waiting for them to come and cut it down for me.

575
00:33:55,941 --> 00:34:00,860
Rym: And he looks at me for a second and he like goes like he's about to argue or something and then he fucking runs.

576
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:02,890
Rym: Yeah, he just turns around and runs.

577
00:34:03,192 --> 00:34:04,559
Scott: I want to run after him and beat him up.

578
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:06,590
Rym: He was a head taller than me.

579
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,056
Scott: basically what happened to mr.

580
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:08,498
Scott: Kung Fu?

581
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:10,243
Rym: Come foot.

582
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:12,632
Rym: it doesn't matter how good you are at a martial art.

583
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:16,032
Rym: anytime you get into an altercation with the person There's a chance you're gonna get hurt.

584
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:19,672
Scott: Yeah But is it where you know, you're not gonna.

585
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:26,139
Scott: it's not gonna kill you So you'll just get hurt in exchange for awesome up now because getting my bike back was my only concern now.

586
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:26,563
Scott: Okay.

587
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,378
Scott: So now so wait the thing is right.

588
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:32,639
Scott: You got to get the keys from the dude to get the bike off now.

589
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,808
Scott: That's the reason to chase him now.

590
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,100
Rym: now also I did not want to interact with him too much.

591
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:45,020
Rym: And that's part of the moral because this is something my dad taught me as a kid and it is rung true to this day.

592
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:49,972
Rym: It is the the one of the entire morals of this whole Event the fabled moral.

593
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:50,414
Rym: Yes.

594
00:34:50,475 --> 00:34:51,299
Rym: It's the fabled moral.

595
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:54,291
Rym: So now I'm standing there and the guys run off.

596
00:34:54,994 --> 00:35:05,280
Rym: I still can't get the bike off So I wait until he's run out of sight and then I follow him Surreptitious like and after he's gotten around the corner, he's just walking kind of hunched over obviously pissed off.

597
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:08,256
Rym: He never once turns around looks behind him and I was.

598
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:11,980
Rym: I kind of like Slicked along and followed him from a distance just to see where he went.

599
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:16,117
Rym: He lives in those crappy shady like low-rent apartments next to rambling Alex live.

600
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:18,104
Rym: Uh-huh So I know exactly where he lives.

601
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:20,875
Rym: I've seen the dude like hanging out around town since then.

602
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:32,012
Rym: Mm-hmm so All right, I determined that he's gone back to his house and because I bluffed him with the phone thing about the police He's obviously not going to go back to where the bike is anytime soon.

603
00:35:32,334 --> 00:35:33,217
Rym: Let's the police get him.

604
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:33,719
Rym: Mm-hmm.

605
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,339
Rym: So now I go into Emily's apartments like what do I do?

606
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,638
Rym: So I scavenge around and it just so happens that Emily has a hacksaw.

607
00:35:41,302 --> 00:35:41,925
Scott: Aren't these big?

608
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:42,408
Scott: are these?

609
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:43,593
Scott: what kind of chains are on there?

610
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:47,211
Scott: They're like New York City kind of change Yes, so how's the hacksaw gonna get through that?

611
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:47,753
Rym: It's got a hex.

612
00:35:47,794 --> 00:35:49,160
Rym: I was cut through those things like butter.

613
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,406
Rym: Have you ever used a hacksaw?

614
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,997
Scott: Yeah, but I mean through that kind of chain really?

615
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:55,663
Scott: Yeah butter Uh-huh.

616
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:56,915
Scott: What's it been some hacks?

617
00:35:57,016 --> 00:36:02,339
Rym: Uh, yeah Well, the the main part of the chain was about the thickness of this allen rash a little thicker than this.

618
00:36:03,184 --> 00:36:05,848
Scott: Okay, no so that wasn't the big New York City chain got.

619
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:11,051
Rym: the big New York City chain is not that much thicker than this and would Take maybe two more minutes of hacksawing to get through.

620
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,638
Scott: I must have been a good hacksaw.

621
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,519
Rym: Hacksaws or hacksaws?

622
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:16,188
Rym: You've obviously never used.

623
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:17,960
Scott: the head views the hacksaw but I take it.

624
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,663
Scott: Oh, it took me a lot of time to get through metal Maybe you're not?

625
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:25,619
Scott: that's like I'm had some pipes and it would take me like, you know, 15 minutes.

626
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:25,940
Scott: really.

627
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:28,997
Rym: Yeah, it took me 10 minutes to hacksaw through this entire chain.

628
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:29,399
Scott: All right.

629
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:37,480
Rym: So anyway, I grabbed like this hacksaw and a bunch of wrenches Oh not wrenches, but a bunch of like pliers and things and I walked back down there.

630
00:36:38,122 --> 00:36:42,076
Rym: And of course now if the dude like comes back you can attack him with a hacksaw.

631
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:42,878
Rym: Yes, I can hack.

632
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:56,000
Rym: saw him Because remember part of my you know bluff with the phone, you know saying I called the police was that in case I didn't really want to have to fight the guy but I was prepared to fight the guy and mean being machine.

633
00:36:56,483 --> 00:37:00,386
Rym: basically, my plan was to Bluff with the phone.

634
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:04,840
Rym: if he calls my bluff at all or looks like he's about to call my bluff.

635
00:37:05,383 --> 00:37:06,588
Rym: I was gonna be a kick in the nuts.

636
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:14,799
Rym: pretty much unprovoked and immediate Yep, but now he ran and nothing could have been more of telling of his guilt than the fact that he ran.

637
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:16,304
Rym: Ran.

638
00:37:16,324 --> 00:37:16,887
Rym: Mm-hmm.

639
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:18,256
Rym: Also proved that he's a coward.

640
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:22,255
Rym: Yep So I go back and the bikes there and this is what I learned.

641
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:25,931
Rym: This is a secondary moral a secondary fable part of this.

642
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:26,333
Rym: Mm-hmm.

643
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,987
Rym: I Stole my bike back and Many many people observed me doing this.

644
00:37:32,388 --> 00:37:34,816
Rym: No one so much as looked at me twice.

645
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:37,880
Rym: No one called the police No one even asked me what I was doing.

646
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,743
Rym: I'm sitting there in a trench coat hunched over some dudes bike hack sawing the chain off loudly and Obviously.

647
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:51,154
Rym: people walked by as a train had let out and did not eat like.

648
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:52,077
Rym: they just walked right by.

649
00:37:52,117 --> 00:37:52,879
Rym: they didn't even look at me.

650
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:56,373
Rym: No one slowed down their car no one.

651
00:37:56,393 --> 00:37:57,800
Scott: well, you know what it is, right?

652
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,058
Scott: Is this like if you're doing something like that and you're actually guilty, right?

653
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,607
Scott: Why would you do it?

654
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:04,474
Scott: in plain sight?

655
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:08,013
Scott: you would do it all Shady like if it was dark and like you were trying to hide from people.

656
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:09,620
Scott: then they'd be like a whole bike thief.

657
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,816
Scott: But the fact that you're doing it wide open Suggested that you would like lost your bike keys or something.

658
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,928
Scott: That's the assumption that good people make.

659
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:23,600
Rym: the answer to that clearly is I should steal every bike and beacon duh With a hacksaw loudly, this is the difference.

660
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,860
Scott: This is why right like a cowardly thief like that fails.

661
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,445
Scott: But the brave thief does not.

662
00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:34,948
Scott: the brave thief will just go and act like he's supposed to be there and he can just commit Crimes in plain sight and no one will even realize it.

663
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:38,120
Scott: even cowardly thief tries to do things the TV way.

664
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:40,298
Scott: You know, it's the same thing with like the terrorists, right?

665
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:48,070
Scott: The the terrorists that succeed are the you know The very few that are like engineers with the smart thing, of course Those people are good and would never do such a thing.

666
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:53,840
Rym: even better though at one point You know after I've cut the bike off and remember one I kind of skipped this part.

667
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,315
Rym: But well after the guy ran away and I followed him to see where he lived.

668
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:58,279
Rym: I went back to the bike.

669
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:10,394
Rym: first I took my front seat at my seat and the front tire off So that if he happened to go back like if I was unable to cut the bike off till the next day At least he couldn't ride it away To slow him down.

670
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:24,844
Rym: Hmm So I carried that back up and you know I had cut the bike off again and I was walking back up toward Emily's house carrying a bike that was missing its front tire and carrying a hacksaw and Carrying the chain I had just cut.

671
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:28,355
Rym: yeah a cop drove by slowly and did not even like.

672
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:30,080
Rym: he saw me and did not even care.

673
00:39:30,421 --> 00:39:32,973
Rym: Yeah, didn't even ask like is that your bike?

674
00:39:32,993 --> 00:39:36,894
Rym: I Expected the cop to at least be like is that your bike?

675
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:37,820
Rym: and if he saw I said yes.

676
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:41,740
Rym: Maybe he just would have not cared the fact that he said nothing What's hilarious?

677
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:43,759
Scott: He didn't even look at you.

678
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:50,131
Rym: He looked at me like the way cops look at everybody when they drive by like with that You know non seeing like I look.

679
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:51,860
Rym: but I do not mean that's even it.

680
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,019
Scott: You know, usually we're all like a police can't be searching my shit.

681
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:58,680
Scott: You're telling me that's not like probable cause to at least talk to someone.

682
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,987
Rym: Yes, like if you tried to arrest me over the hacksaw and a bike with missing pieces, but at least the hey How's it going there mister?

683
00:40:07,027 --> 00:40:08,432
Rym: You need some help with that bike.

684
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:09,436
Scott: All right.

685
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:10,299
Rym: Can I help you?

686
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,045
Scott: At least you know what that.

687
00:40:12,145 --> 00:40:14,336
Scott: that makes me feel good about those police those.

688
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:16,988
Scott: that's a good policeman You just you know, let's it go.

689
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:17,491
Scott: cuz he does.

690
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:18,476
Scott: now he doesn't know the story.

691
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:19,300
Scott: It could be anything.

692
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:21,759
Rym: What's cool in general is it is a reasonable doubt?

693
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,440
Rym: Beacon police have been generally cooler to me than any police I've ever engaged with in my entire life.

694
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,110
Scott: I know right the beacon police are so much better like the fish kill police.

695
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:39,040
Rym: Oh my god, the Newburgh police coolest thing beacon police There are no speed traps when they do a quote-unquote speed trap There's only one place they go and it's this road where people shouldn't fucking be speeding.

696
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:42,401
Scott: Also, they like to put their speeding machines out, you know Which?

697
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:47,119
Scott: actually if you investigate like the statistics of those things they actually work really well.

698
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,453
Rym: I accept increasing safety for a low price except against what you know.

699
00:40:51,473 --> 00:40:56,739
Rym: when I was young and I had my race car as a Kid those were basically high score meters.

700
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:03,680
Scott: You know statistically those things work really well and they're well worth, you know, putting them in strategic places.

701
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:07,378
Rym: They should put the train station because people go like 50 miles an hour through that like pie.

702
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:11,520
Scott: All right Well, they have one there all the time, but they never actually sit near them and pulling it over.

703
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,532
Scott: They just leave them out there, which is what you're supposed to do with.

704
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:14,920
Rym: but when they do, you know traps.

705
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,945
Rym: They don't do speed trap.

706
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:19,380
Rym: They do fucking four-way stop Jesus Christ traps.

707
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:26,848
Rym: Yeah and I love it when they do that because literally I'll see them pull over and many people as could possibly Pulled over and I was a cop.

708
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:28,516
Scott: I would do the only kind of pull.

709
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:33,657
Scott: I could totally Fulfill all quotas just by pulling people over for not putting their goddamn lights on.

710
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:34,520
Rym: Oh my god.

711
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,313
Scott: Yeah, so is that the whole story of the bike returning?

712
00:41:39,634 --> 00:41:41,180
Rym: well, there's all the little follow-up stuff.

713
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:46,696
Rym: But basically, yeah, I got you know, I go back I carry the bike back and the chain and you know this guy.

714
00:41:46,776 --> 00:41:47,580
Rym: he's such a genius.

715
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:49,048
Rym: I'll get to that part.

716
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:51,119
Rym: I can explain all the reasons why he's a genius.

717
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:54,827
Rym: It's better there's so it's.

718
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:56,794
Rym: there's so much to why this guy is so great.

719
00:41:57,175 --> 00:41:58,560
Rym: I carried the bike back to Emily's house.

720
00:41:58,962 --> 00:41:59,724
Rym: I'm victorious.

721
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:01,230
Rym: I have my bike.

722
00:42:01,531 --> 00:42:02,535
Rym: I feel like a man.

723
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:03,780
Rym: I confronted the guy.

724
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:11,217
Rym: I bluffed I was willing to fight but I did not actually have to fight Because of my clever bluff of having called the police with my dead cell phone.

725
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:17,527
Rym: Mm-hmm and Emily comes home and I tell the story and everyone's happy and The stories don't.

726
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:18,151
Rym: I've got my bike.

727
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:19,078
Rym: I have to get it fixed.

728
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,347
Rym: There was damage done.

729
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:23,860
Rym: I'm gonna have to spend about a hundred bikes bucks fixing this bike.

730
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,640
Rym: Let's just get new bike because this bike is a great bike.

731
00:42:26,741 --> 00:42:28,437
Rym: I'm gonna get a new bike, but I'm gonna keep this bike.

732
00:42:28,904 --> 00:42:33,215
Rym: Yeah Actually, my plan is to buy a new bike but I'm going to buy a street bike.

733
00:42:33,255 --> 00:42:34,459
Rym: as much as I like mountain biking.

734
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:38,075
Rym: I Don't mountain bike enough to justify a $2,000 mountain bike.

735
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:49,169
Scott: I'm gonna get a bike that is comfortable for just going around the streets like ah So I'm going to keep this, you know, the most kind of comfortable bike would actually be the recumbent bike But that's that's not gonna happen.

736
00:42:49,209 --> 00:42:49,511
Scott: Why not?

737
00:42:49,913 --> 00:42:51,040
Scott: It's like you get fucking killed.

738
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:58,680
Rym: So I'm gonna keep this bike as my mountain bike and I'm gonna basically now I'm gonna renovate the thing I'm gonna have to replace like all the stuff the jackass broke on it.

739
00:42:58,902 --> 00:43:02,890
Scott: Yeah, I mean I've had Two bikes stolen one the fart.

740
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,640
Scott: the second bike I had stolen was the far less exciting story.

741
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,759
Scott: I was in summer camp actually and my bike was just sort of tied up on the side of the house.

742
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:16,003
Scott: and Then I was at Action Park.

743
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:17,689
Scott: Oh, is it Dorney Park?

744
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:19,556
Scott: I forget doesn't matter.

745
00:43:19,577 --> 00:43:20,460
Scott: I was a summer camp.

746
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,673
Scott: I was on a summer camp trip to an amusement park.

747
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:23,880
Scott: I was in an arcade.

748
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:28,972
Scott: I used the pay, you know when you're out at summer camp You always use the payphone to call your parents whenever you're out and about.

749
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:31,867
Scott: so I did and my mom was like Yeah, your bike got stolen.

750
00:43:31,888 --> 00:43:33,579
Scott: I was like fun the fucking side of the house.

751
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:34,603
Scott: What the fuck.

752
00:43:35,326 --> 00:43:35,788
Scott: and that was it.

753
00:43:35,848 --> 00:43:39,723
Scott: and then since then I didn't have a bike again until the one that I have now Which is broken.

754
00:43:39,763 --> 00:43:43,580
Scott: but the bike I had before that one right was stolen.

755
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:57,031
Scott: basically, I was stupid and we were you know, basically I used my bike to go between all different friends houses who lived on the Same street and you know, we'd all ride bikes around and whatnot, you know to play wiffle ball Whatever and I had left it, you know lying on the lawn.

756
00:43:57,813 --> 00:43:58,436
Rym: I always did that.

757
00:43:58,456 --> 00:43:59,540
Rym: There's never any trouble, right?

758
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,471
Scott: So, you know, I was upstairs playing some video games.

759
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:06,100
Scott: It was you know, nice bright, you know, sunny day.

760
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:22,537
Scott: I was you know, and You know, I hear like some, you know kids laughing outside but the only kids on our block are the ones that I know the ones I go to ride bikes with and I look out the window and I see some like, you know three kids I don't know on bikes riding down the hill and I'm like, oh new kids, huh?

761
00:44:22,738 --> 00:44:27,586
Scott: Oh, whatever I'm playing some video games playing some video games Go outside.

762
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:31,607
Scott: eventually, you know after like an hour or so Bikes gone.

763
00:44:32,151 --> 00:44:35,166
Scott: My friend's bike is gone My friend's friend's bike is gone.

764
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:38,840
Scott: Everyone's bikes are gone because everyone had left them lying on their lawns respectively.

765
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:44,080
Scott: It's apparently some new kids came along and stole all our bikes at once the whole blocks worth of bikes.

766
00:44:44,901 --> 00:45:01,400
Scott: Apparently stealing one bike is really not enough to get the police to show up but back in that day and time in the summer In a town where there's not that much crime really when a whole blocks worth of bikes got stolen all at once You know, the police decide to actually come and do something.

767
00:45:01,781 --> 00:45:05,314
Scott: So, but you know, they're actually like three police cars on our street.

768
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:07,060
Scott: Everyone was talking to him.

769
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:12,180
Scott: They were taking statements and asking questions and you know, they had little notebooks writing everything down.

770
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:15,791
Scott: You know, my dad gets in his car and starts driving around looking.

771
00:45:16,252 --> 00:45:20,731
Scott: the police are driving around looking, you know I'm just sitting at home going dum-dee-dum.

772
00:45:20,812 --> 00:45:22,200
Scott: I guess I'll just play more video games.

773
00:45:24,385 --> 00:45:28,260
Scott: Eventually, my dad comes back with my bike and I'm like, whoa, what the fuck.

774
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:35,970
Scott: Apparently as he told it as I remember this is like a long time ago like Almost 20 years ago.

775
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,636
Scott: The way he told it was that he was just.

776
00:45:37,697 --> 00:45:38,520
Scott: he found the kids.

777
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:40,919
Scott: He was driving after him.

778
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:48,679
Scott: He got to like an intersection and cops are coming at him from the other end of the intersection And the kids like bail off into the woods.

779
00:45:49,561 --> 00:45:53,863
Scott: My dad gets the bike back and I guess the police got the kid And my bike.

780
00:45:53,903 --> 00:45:56,233
Scott: I got it back, but they bent the handle handlebars.

781
00:45:56,494 --> 00:45:57,840
Rym: How do you bend the handlebars?

782
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,822
Scott: I don't understand.

783
00:45:58,883 --> 00:46:03,740
Scott: apparently this thing a lot of people do and did is done when they get a bike like bend the handlebars.

784
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,360
Scott: They'll just like go and bend them.

785
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:06,944
Scott: It's like ah So like.

786
00:46:06,984 --> 00:46:09,380
Scott: I sat on the bike and I was like, oh and I put my hands on the handlebars.

787
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,199
Scott: It's like what the fuck like you could tell immediately they were wrong.

788
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:18,329
Scott: So my dad sort of bent him back to where they were but it was like it was not New handlebars.

789
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:19,616
Scott: Yeah, it was a Huffy.

790
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:22,427
Scott: So whatever It was like who gave a shit.

791
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,437
Scott: All right, it was like a $50 bike.

792
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:33,870
Scott: But the point is, you know, they stole it and I used that bike a lot in those days to go around you know to people's houses and It was actually you know what that would.

793
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,220
Scott: that is something that will not happen ever again, you know.

794
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,919
Scott: Police actually like chasing down bike thieves.

795
00:46:39,622 --> 00:46:42,231
Scott: Yeah, all of our bikes were returned and all those kids.

796
00:46:42,653 --> 00:46:47,508
Scott: I saw them sitting in the back of the police cars going Ah shit, nah Juvy to them.

797
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:52,654
Scott: I don't know if they'll go to juvie But they'll probably just get you know a scolding and get sent back to their parents.

798
00:46:52,754 --> 00:46:58,695
Scott: Whatever those kids are now Probably I imagine they are not presidents of large corporations.

799
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,084
Scott: I Would bet on that.

800
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:03,332
Rym: so an assessment of my bike.

801
00:47:03,412 --> 00:47:04,134
Rym: as I get it back.

802
00:47:04,495 --> 00:47:10,605
Rym: the dude had one Poorly tried to disguise it Very poorly like it's like.

803
00:47:10,826 --> 00:47:11,448
Rym: so he won.

804
00:47:11,468 --> 00:47:12,211
Scott: Why is it the bike?

805
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:13,656
Scott: thieves always vandalize the bike.

806
00:47:13,696 --> 00:47:18,940
Scott: if I'm gonna steal a bike Number one, I'll probably do a Rym did I'll just hack saw it in plain sight.

807
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,356
Scott: number two, I'll take it far far away and never go back to where it came from with it.

808
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,915
Scott: and Three I won't do anything to it because it's probably in really good condition.

809
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:29,940
Scott: Why would I ruin it?

810
00:47:30,122 --> 00:47:31,019
Scott: If anything I'll make it better.

811
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:37,725
Rym: Well, because I have an assessment of the person who stole my bike and I think it's pretty accurate I feel that he because he was he looked like he was about 27 28 like about our age.

812
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,960
Rym: Okay, and I'm pretty sure he's a habitual thief of opportunity.

813
00:47:45,702 --> 00:47:51,800
Rym: I have a feeling that this guy will pretty much steal anything that is easily stolen without a lot of risk.

814
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,093
Scott: Why doesn't he robbed like all the stores in town that have no security whatsoever?

815
00:47:55,114 --> 00:47:56,700
Rym: Because that's that's upping the ante.

816
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,731
Rym: There's a lot more risk there, but see like someone leaves a bike out.

817
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:02,400
Rym: someone leaves like a car running whatever.

818
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,851
Rym: I don't know if he'd even steal a car and he's on that level.

819
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,357
Rym: someone leaves something out.

820
00:48:06,418 --> 00:48:08,111
Rym: Just take it you can use it.

821
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:15,026
Rym: and the reason I think this is that it wasn't just a punk kid like I expected stealing it for a jar ride because a punk Kid would have left it in the woods somewhere.

822
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:17,336
Rym: Yeah, or would like I don't sell it.

823
00:48:17,356 --> 00:48:18,280
Rym: They would have done something with it.

824
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,900
Rym: They wouldn't have continued to use it as their mode of transportation.

825
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:27,818
Rym: mmm, and - he knew that you know, there was a danger of being caught.

826
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:43,480
Rym: he Obviously has done this before or at least put enough thought enough pre meditation into his actions after stealing it as a theft of opportunity and To disguise it poorly in order to prevent it from being discovered that he is in fact stolen it.

827
00:48:43,842 --> 00:48:45,959
Rym: So he thought that through to some degree.

828
00:48:47,241 --> 00:48:51,440
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, it's like they know they had to do something, but he thought you didn't do enough.

829
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,420
Rym: Now also to disguise that he cut up the seat as much as he could.

830
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,681
Rym: I don't know how he could ride it though Cuz.

831
00:48:56,721 --> 00:48:59,975
Rym: basically it would shove a spike up your ass if you sat on it.

832
00:48:59,995 --> 00:49:00,718
Scott: He probably didn't sit.

833
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:01,240
Scott: he price stood.

834
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:03,932
Rym: Yeah, push pushing push pushing along.

835
00:49:03,952 --> 00:49:05,680
Scott: Yeah, obviously not a bite expert.

836
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:08,053
Scott: Now please if you're a bike expert you have your own bike.

837
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:09,300
Scott: I don't think you become a bike.

838
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,847
Rym: I don't think he knew how to shift the gears.

839
00:49:11,188 --> 00:49:16,380
Rym: Yeah, because one the gear was in the gear I'd left it in which is a gear you can't really use to ride it.

840
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,297
Rym: It's like the going up a steep hill gear the granny gear.

841
00:49:19,317 --> 00:49:21,372
Rym: Yes Well or the mountain biker gear.

842
00:49:22,037 --> 00:49:22,340
Rym: and two.

843
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:27,380
Rym: I don't think he knew how to shift the front gears because he cut off the front shifter wire completely.

844
00:49:27,482 --> 00:49:28,152
Rym: He removed it.

845
00:49:28,415 --> 00:49:28,639
Scott: what?

846
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:36,700
Rym: Because I think the way the way it was left He probably wasn't strong enough to ride it and he couldn't figure out how to shift it to an easier gear.

847
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:40,096
Rym: So we cut the wire which caused it to default to the easiest gear.

848
00:49:40,116 --> 00:49:43,852
Rym: Yeah So I have to replace like the shifter wire and everything.

849
00:49:43,872 --> 00:49:45,438
Scott: Yeah, I just buy a new one.

850
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,449
Rym: Why this bike is still like the frame.

851
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:50,678
Rym: It'd be like 400 bucks to buy another frame like that.

852
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,946
Rym: Whatever plus.

853
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:57,060
Rym: I mean like I said, I'm gonna keep this as my mountain bike.

854
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,476
Rym: I'm gonna fully refurbish it cuz that's still a lot cheaper than buying a new mountain bike.

855
00:50:00,557 --> 00:50:14,207
Rym: and I prefer I've ridden like the 11,000 $12,000 mountain bikes and I still to this day prefer a hardtail over a full suspension mostly because I don't do the crazy hardcore mountain biking I do like I'm a mid-core.

856
00:50:14,267 --> 00:50:17,220
Scott: I don't think I'll ever need a bike with the rear suspension.

857
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:20,176
Scott: Maybe if I had a motorcycle I would need what?

858
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:21,561
Rym: Something.

859
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:27,264
Rym: and I'm gonna buy a street bike like new like a three or four thousand dollar nice street bike and I'll use that as My street biking around.

860
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:31,480
Scott: but yeah, I'll get a new one in the spring that is appropriate for city bikings.

861
00:50:31,901 --> 00:50:34,129
Rym: But dude, the dude probably maybe even left.

862
00:50:34,149 --> 00:50:43,245
Rym: he had a bike originally that he left behind somewhere because he stole it from the train Station, you know, I left it unlocked with all the other bikes like not obviously Not locked up.

863
00:50:43,265 --> 00:51:01,260
Rym: you would have had to go over and like check and be like hey This bike isn't locked and take it so definitely habitual thief of opportunity Coward because he ran away from me when he could have easily at least from perception You're just looking at me He possibly could have from his perception overpowered being just taking the bike away and then been safe.

864
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:06,419
Rym: But no he ran as soon as there was any thought of the police possibly finding him.

865
00:51:06,962 --> 00:51:13,160
Scott: I mean what you know, it probably you know, either a It was like, you know a repeat offenders.

866
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,489
Scott: So, you know the police it was not gonna be too good.

867
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:19,785
Scott: because I mean really if that's all he'd ever done was stolen that Bike really?

868
00:51:19,865 --> 00:51:20,829
Scott: What's the penalty?

869
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,580
Scott: It's not that bad, you know, what are they gonna put you?

870
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:31,168
Scott: I mean they go to jail really probably for that, you know, and if you do it'll be like for days not for you Know months and months and months like if you would.

871
00:51:31,308 --> 00:51:33,457
Rym: but I just think the psychology I were the reason.

872
00:51:33,477 --> 00:51:40,500
Rym: I think he's a repeat Offender and habitual and all this is just the manner in which he disguised the bike was so premeditated and yet so poor.

873
00:51:41,323 --> 00:51:48,352
Scott: No, that's the thing is like anyone who's actually good at crime Doesn't get caught and is not really considered to be a criminal.

874
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:51,764
Scott: This is what organized crime is all about Even worse.

875
00:51:51,844 --> 00:51:58,007
Rym: anyone who's smart enough to pull off like the crazy crime could probably make more money with a job Exactly.

876
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:00,359
Scott: That's that's another problem Yep.

877
00:52:00,763 --> 00:52:01,991
Rym: So I gotta like repair all this.

878
00:52:02,072 --> 00:52:06,360
Scott: anyone who's smart enough to do Terrorism is smart enough to make a lot of money with being an engineer.

879
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:10,944
Scott: Anyone who's smart, you know, this is the same problem The whole world has all not.

880
00:52:11,005 --> 00:52:21,740
Scott: the vast majority of people with evil intent are also incredibly stupid because anyone who's incredibly Smart can actually get what they want without being you know evil.

881
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:25,860
Scott: It's like if you're really smart, you can get rich just by working.

882
00:52:26,784 --> 00:52:32,439
Scott: The only people who are gonna resort to crime to get bunch of money People were not smart enough to get a good job.

883
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:39,400
Rym: I mean look despite the fact that he disguised the bike as best as his brain could manage He parked it where he stole it.

884
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:47,739
Rym: But again, look he recognized that I'm the whoever he stole it from might see it If he left it with all the bikes like chained up to the bike thing.

885
00:52:48,821 --> 00:52:53,539
Rym: So he parked it like 200 yards up the way like the person wouldn't see it.

886
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:55,205
Rym: But that's on the path.

887
00:52:55,245 --> 00:52:57,692
Scott: You'd have to walk if you went that way anyway.

888
00:52:57,712 --> 00:52:58,374
Scott: Yep.

889
00:52:59,036 --> 00:53:00,420
Rym: It's probably been parked there every day.

890
00:53:00,581 --> 00:53:02,835
Rym: I just never walked that way until that one night.

891
00:53:02,855 --> 00:53:03,720
Scott: It's quite possible.

892
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:12,257
Rym: So that and three he had this crazy chain, right and two locks and the chain was like rafting rafting rafting rafting around the bike and around the tree.

893
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:22,065
Rym: Upon investigation after I came back with a hacksaw the entire thing the entire chaining effort Rested upon one link.

894
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:25,917
Rym: Yeah, so I cut that one link off and the bike was free.

895
00:53:26,298 --> 00:53:30,598
Scott: Yep So, you know chains weakest link and such and such.

896
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:37,275
Rym: yes But you'd think if you had two locks He would have thought that he has to have at least more than one link holding the whole thing together.

897
00:53:37,737 --> 00:53:48,059
Scott: Yep The of course there is an exception to what I was saying before about smartness and criminals is that they're obviously Smart criminals like, you know, say Enron guys are made off guys.

898
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:51,580
Scott: But the thing is you can see that they actually they were very smart.

899
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:57,060
Scott: Look how long it took to get made off, you know, he was really smart about not getting caught.

900
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:03,880
Scott: It's just you know, when people when the scrutiny increases, you know, it's you know, it is very difficult to find them.

901
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:08,560
Scott: It was not very difficult to get someone who's dumb thing is people like that.

902
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:22,258
Rym: It would be easy to get them except that the people they sucker Profit in the short term and thus probably know there's something shady going on But have the cognitive dissonance and decide not to act on that because they're getting too much of a return.

903
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:24,269
Rym: Yep That's the real problem.

904
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:26,320
Scott: It's one of the problems.

905
00:54:27,161 --> 00:54:30,713
Rym: Yeah, so back to the device that my dad gave me as a kid.

906
00:54:30,773 --> 00:54:31,475
Rym: and this was all.

907
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:58,554
Rym: this is also independently advice that was given to me by an unrelated police officer at one point in my childhood and the advice was such if you ever Come into conflict some sort of direct altercation with someone who is not intelligent and of a very low Socio-economic class and I very much I want to stress it has to be both, you know You can't just rag on someone who's poor might not be their fault and being poor sucks.

908
00:54:59,036 --> 00:55:09,294
Rym: But if they're poor and Independently of being poor are stupid You do not want to entangle your affairs with them in any capacity and any.

909
00:55:09,836 --> 00:55:23,917
Rym: any time you need Justice or you need some recompense from someone like that Get it as anonymously and as I guess surreptitiously as possible and never in any way officially engage with them.

910
00:55:23,937 --> 00:55:27,599
Rym: if Possible do not ever let them know who you are or where you actually live.

911
00:55:28,163 --> 00:55:35,716
Rym: Mmm because my experience from living in Suburbs next to suburbs that had very different socio-economic classes.

912
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:47,877
Rym: any time There was a conflict between people in the two different neighborhoods The people from the bad neighborhood would basically just come in the night and vandalize and there was no way to prove They did it or get them back.

913
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:59,227
Rym: Mmm people with nothing to lose who are also stupid and or also vindictive can do a lot of economic harm to people who have assets and have something to lose and There's really no way to stop them.

914
00:55:59,408 --> 00:56:00,453
Rym: She had no way to get them back.

915
00:56:00,754 --> 00:56:01,096
Scott: Shoot them.

916
00:56:01,176 --> 00:56:01,960
Rym: That's not an answer.

917
00:56:02,662 --> 00:56:03,867
Rym: Well, of course that happened.

918
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:12,080
Rym: I mean when I was a kid one of those stupid people His day, you know what the statute of limitations all that his name was Nick.

919
00:56:12,441 --> 00:56:16,699
Rym: Oh the kid who's his mom his mom different shot him and his dad.

920
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:26,587
Rym: After the kid came with the dad after they divorced and tried to set the car on fire Came back to the house set the car on fire Menace the wife.

921
00:56:26,808 --> 00:56:28,319
Rym: So the wife shot the dad and the kid dead.

922
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:40,300
Rym: yeah, and those those sorts of people the feet not the people who would basically come back and Vandalize or you know do the sort of nothing to lose surreptitious economic harm.

923
00:56:40,962 --> 00:56:53,567
Rym: you basically don't want to have any interaction with those people because no legal system justice is going to prevent them from coming back and Putting on to you their socio-economic harm Mmm, so the best really

924
00:56:53,648 --> 00:57:01,059
Scott: is strange in a way that like the person who's got like, you know If you you know, like you see your Bill Gates against homeless bum, right?

925
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,910
Scott: Homeless bum can fucking do all this shit to Bill Gates.

926
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:06,174
Scott: He's got nothing to lose.

927
00:57:06,194 --> 00:57:07,840
Scott: and what can Bill Gates do to homeless bum?

928
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:08,981
Scott: Nothing.

929
00:57:09,021 --> 00:57:10,971
Scott: I mean what if he shoots homeless bum then Bill Gates?

930
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:12,839
Scott: that hurts Bill Gates more than hurts almost bum.

931
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:26,549
Rym: Yeah, well, I would argue Morris the idea that As you have to always bear in mind in general that you shouldn't seek revenge you should really only seek justice in that try to make the world go back to the status quo.

932
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,605
Scott: or What I'm saying is that you know, basically this homeless bum, right?

933
00:57:30,645 --> 00:57:35,984
Scott: He's gonna keep your Bill Gates It's almost bum keeps vandalizing your house keeps terrorizing you right?

934
00:57:36,165 --> 00:57:37,349
Scott: There's nothing you can do to him.

935
00:57:37,771 --> 00:57:41,890
Scott: You can you're never gonna he's never gonna do something so serious to go to jail for a long time.

936
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:49,181
Scott: He'll go to jail for a short time and then he'll come and harass you and the amount of time he's away Does not really help you out much at all.

937
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:50,587
Scott: It just gives you like a short respite.

938
00:57:50,607 --> 00:57:51,250
Rym: So look at the harm.

939
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:51,551
Rym: I mean.

940
00:57:51,571 --> 00:57:58,151
Rym: if I have a nice car and someone like this decides that they want to get me they just key up my you know $40,000 car.

941
00:57:58,191 --> 00:58:00,158
Scott: throw some eggs.

942
00:58:00,238 --> 00:58:01,101
Scott: eggs are real cheap.

943
00:58:01,242 --> 00:58:02,345
Scott: The car is expensive.

944
00:58:02,385 --> 00:58:03,630
Scott: He doesn't have a car for you to egg.

945
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,014
Scott: He's almost bum.

946
00:58:05,536 --> 00:58:08,285
Scott: So what what is Bill Gates supposed to do in that situation?

947
00:58:08,646 --> 00:58:11,717
Scott: You know, it's like, okay He's never gonna go to jail forever.

948
00:58:11,737 --> 00:58:13,323
Scott: He's never gonna move away.

949
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:15,150
Scott: He's never gonna stop harassing me.

950
00:58:15,432 --> 00:58:17,266
Scott: He has no money for us to take away, right?

951
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,415
Scott: There's a restraining order.

952
00:58:19,456 --> 00:58:22,530
Scott: doesn't help because then he just goes to jail for a short time and gets out again to harass me.

953
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,750
Scott: Again, I have all sorts of things that harass.

954
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:28,830
Rym: They gonna say you engage with one of these people anonymously and they are out of kidding with you.

955
00:58:29,612 --> 00:58:35,530
Rym: If you follow up with legal action now, there's a record and he can find out your name and your address and all that stuff.

956
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:40,970
Scott: Yeah, so what can Bill Gates really do if a homeless bum wants to bother him?

957
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:50,467
Scott: You can hire, you know, Bill Gates is so rich that he can have a private security force like bodyguards and stuff And thus he specifically when you're on that level of richness.

958
00:58:50,507 --> 00:58:51,250
Scott: He doesn't have to worry.

959
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:57,370
Scott: But what if you're like say a lawyer just a normal kind of lawyer in a town you make half a million dollars a year.

960
00:58:57,531 --> 00:58:59,379
Scott: You're wealthy, but you're not Bill Gates rich.

961
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,870
Scott: You don't have bodyguards or a private security force.

962
00:59:02,191 --> 00:59:08,218
Scott: You just drive a Porsche and you have a five-bedroom house of the big lawn, man I'm gonna have a five-bedroom house real soon.

963
00:59:08,299 --> 00:59:13,423
Scott: and you got a harsh and you got a homeless bum Fothering you and you have this problem.

964
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:16,233
Scott: I just described with Bill Gates Really?

965
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:19,690
Scott: It's like, you know, you can shoot the bum, you know, obviously that's revenge.

966
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:26,470
Scott: But at the same time that will and is one of the few courses of action you can take that will stop the problem.

967
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:29,390
Scott: However, it's like what else can you possibly do?

968
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,075
Scott: You can't afford private security.

969
00:59:31,496 --> 00:59:35,590
Scott: the legal system will not keep the homeless bum away from you long enough.

970
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:38,742
Scott: You could I guess move which is like why should you move?

971
00:59:38,782 --> 00:59:43,053
Scott: just gives a homeless bum and this sort of Same problem.

972
00:59:43,073 --> 00:59:48,750
Scott: We're like some like illegal immigrant drives a car with no insurance and crashes into you.

973
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:50,381
Scott: You know, it's the same problem.

974
00:59:50,401 --> 00:59:51,449
Scott: It's like what the fuck can you do?

975
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:59,122
Rym: Well, the sad the really sad thing is that I wish I wasn't just speaking from experience But having you know, I was born in downtown Detroit.

976
00:59:59,142 --> 01:00:10,769
Rym: Like I lived in downtown Detroit for a long time which it's always funny like People who don't know me like strangers I bring that up and they always suddenly get this perception that I'm hard somehow.

977
01:00:11,671 --> 01:00:13,600
Rym: Yeah, born in downtown Detroit.

978
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:15,849
Rym: I'm just I'm just some IT guys, right?

979
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,077
Scott: I actually have a solution for this problem.

980
01:00:18,459 --> 01:00:30,101
Rym: because but at the same I just want to point out that you know Having lived there and then having moved to very wealthy suburbs next to very poor suburbs and you know But there are cool people in the nice areas and cool people like.

981
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:32,430
Rym: there were cool people in both classes.

982
01:00:32,722 --> 01:00:41,602
Rym: Yeah but the people who were not cool who were in the lower class were the ones who and they would often come into the Neighborhoods and just wreak havoc and there was nothing that could be done.

983
01:00:41,783 --> 01:00:41,964
Scott: Yep.

984
01:00:42,124 --> 01:00:42,967
Rym: So what's your solution?

985
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:43,690
Rym: sky solution?

986
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:47,770
Scott: So when I went to Israel back in oh, oh, so I depart them to Israel.

987
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:53,875
Scott: No, but you know, they basically told us, you know Don't smoke weed.

988
01:00:53,996 --> 01:00:54,920
Scott: Don't do nothing.

989
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,563
Scott: Good God.

990
01:00:55,663 --> 01:00:56,768
Scott: and we're like, you know, why?

991
01:00:56,809 --> 01:00:57,110
Scott: what are they?

992
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:02,693
Scott: You know, of course, no one did right even though one Israeli guy tried to get us to They.

993
01:01:02,733 --> 01:01:08,850
Scott: basically they were like look if you do it You'll get exiled and you know be allowed back here again and you'll be exiled immediately.

994
01:01:09,091 --> 01:01:14,870
Rym: So where do we exile American citizens to let alone all of the constitutional ramifications of this?

995
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:16,353
Scott: It doesn't matter.

996
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:17,298
Scott: We just exiled them.

997
01:01:17,499 --> 01:01:18,926
Scott: You don't have to exile them to anywhere.

998
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:19,710
Rym: What do you mean?

999
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,469
Rym: So what do you send them into the ocean?

1000
01:01:23,251 --> 01:01:24,619
Rym: It's like you got that's.

1001
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,786
Rym: you might as well just hang him.

1002
01:01:25,806 --> 01:01:26,490
Rym: It's the same thing.

1003
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:28,970
Scott: Well, no, it's the same as like when you're at a bar late at night.

1004
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:31,561
Scott: It's like you don't gotta go home, but you can't stay here.

1005
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:34,995
Rym: So yeah Scott your example of homeless bum He can't afford to go anywhere.

1006
01:01:35,015 --> 01:01:38,130
Scott: That's why exiling is the best cuz he can't afford to come back.

1007
01:01:38,677 --> 01:01:39,490
Rym: So where do you take him?

1008
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:53,405
Rym: I mean how many like there were a lot of places in Detroit were in the Detroit suburbs where there'd be homeless people who'd like Get themselves out to the fancy suburbs and it basically what the police would do is pick them up Drive them to downtown Detroit and just leave them there.

1009
01:01:53,445 --> 01:01:55,174
Scott: That's not far enough But you know what?

1010
01:01:55,334 --> 01:01:56,660
Scott: Actually, that's not a bad idea.

1011
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,363
Scott: Come to think of it.

1012
01:01:57,584 --> 01:01:58,990
Scott: There's no one nice left in Detroit.

1013
01:01:59,071 --> 01:02:00,227
Scott: Let's just send everyone to do.

1014
01:02:00,977 --> 01:02:01,849
Rym: No, I have this crazy.

1015
01:02:02,934 --> 01:02:03,777
Rym: I think what we should do.

1016
01:02:03,797 --> 01:02:06,005
Rym: I want to do a show on this because I want to talk.

1017
01:02:06,045 --> 01:02:07,732
Rym: I want to present my full Idea.

1018
01:02:07,752 --> 01:02:09,360
Rym: take the homeless bums.

1019
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:09,762
Rym: No, no.

1020
01:02:09,802 --> 01:02:10,506
Rym: No, it's actually a real.

1021
01:02:10,546 --> 01:02:11,310
Rym: I think it's a good idea.

1022
01:02:11,752 --> 01:02:18,729
Rym: I want to present this idea to you and to the listeners and I want I Want people to argue against this idea because I think it's something we could debate.

1023
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:25,430
Rym: Imagine if the federal government took over the city of Detroit kind of like Robocop style like Detroit is done.

1024
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:26,739
Scott: Well, you need a Robocop.

1025
01:02:26,779 --> 01:02:30,438
Scott: First of all, well Spitzer listen, I nominate myself.

1026
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:31,723
Rym: You want to be Robocop?

1027
01:02:32,064 --> 01:02:32,285
Scott: Hells.

1028
01:02:32,305 --> 01:02:33,550
Scott: Yeah, I got a gun in my leg.

1029
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,472
Rym: It's pretty easy.

1030
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:38,162
Rym: step one run afoul of like 40 guys with guns.

1031
01:02:38,403 --> 01:02:41,250
Rym: step two get shot for like 10 minutes straight.

1032
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:43,067
Rym: step three Robocop.

1033
01:02:44,172 --> 01:02:45,901
Scott: See, I don't think the step three exists yet.

1034
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:50,460
Scott: Otherwise, I would do the step one And I need a guarantee of the step three.

1035
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,263
Rym: little-known fact.

1036
01:02:51,283 --> 01:02:52,650
Rym: That was the first rated X movie.

1037
01:02:53,173 --> 01:02:54,159
Scott: I don't think it was rated X.

1038
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:54,964
Rym: It was originally.

1039
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:55,729
Rym: they had to tone it down.

1040
01:02:56,392 --> 01:03:00,270
Rym: That shooting scene in the beginning was too hardcore for Robocop was hardcore.

1041
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,558
Scott: I mean that gun just like a blue people's brains.

1042
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:05,930
Rym: Anyway, but the thing is I watched that like oh, no gun.

1043
01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:08,397
Rym: I watched that scene again recently on YouTube.

1044
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,346
Rym: It's pretty tame by nowadays standards.

1045
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:11,808
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1046
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:13,956
Scott: Oh, yeah I mean, well you seen each of the killer.

1047
01:03:13,976 --> 01:03:17,150
Rym: I mean, yeah thing is it's not that far off from each of the killer.

1048
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:22,650
Rym: I know right Jesus, but say we took Detroit and it became a federal city.

1049
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:25,326
Rym: It is no longer under the jurisdiction of the state of Michigan.

1050
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:26,010
Rym: It is a separate.

1051
01:03:26,673 --> 01:03:28,945
Scott: I don't think that's gonna work constitutionally.

1052
01:03:29,608 --> 01:03:29,950
Rym: Why not?

1053
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:31,414
Scott: It's you can't do that.

1054
01:03:31,455 --> 01:03:33,243
Rym: Do you convince Michigan to seed it?

1055
01:03:33,363 --> 01:03:34,830
Rym: seed the land to the federal government?

1056
01:03:35,472 --> 01:03:36,462
Scott: I don't know that's gonna work.

1057
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:37,250
Rym: Why that would work?

1058
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:38,357
Rym: You'd have to bribe the state.

1059
01:03:38,377 --> 01:03:43,905
Rym: just remember back in the day like Michigan Kind of went to war with Ohio and the feds were like you get this land.

1060
01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:44,829
Rym: Ohio gets this land.

1061
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:49,570
Scott: Yeah, but I mean that would be like if they just I don't think that can happen.

1062
01:03:50,332 --> 01:03:51,498
Rym: Basically, I think we could do it.

1063
01:03:51,618 --> 01:03:53,729
Rym: one we could do some sort of martial law thing to do it.

1064
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:54,855
Scott: I don't think they can do.

1065
01:03:54,975 --> 01:03:57,147
Rym: or some sort of eminent domains do it.

1066
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:02,970
Rym: or You just convinced the state of Michigan to sell it to the federal government because the state of Michigan has no money.

1067
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:07,344
Rym: They need money desperately and much of the rest of Michigan does not like Detroit.

1068
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:08,930
Rym: So it would be win-win for everyone.

1069
01:04:09,414 --> 01:04:12,374
Rym: Yeah, we make it a communist city Communist city.

1070
01:04:12,635 --> 01:04:15,286
Rym: the feds take it over and you put out the call.

1071
01:04:15,506 --> 01:04:17,379
Rym: anyone in America No matter what.

1072
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:21,304
Rym: if you move to Detroit We will give you a place to live and a living wage.

1073
01:04:21,405 --> 01:04:22,349
Scott: and who's gonna pay for that?

1074
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:23,494
Rym: Taxpayers.

1075
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:25,904
Scott: and we already don't have any money as it is.

1076
01:04:25,924 --> 01:04:27,992
Rym: We have plenty of taxpayer money Uh-huh.

1077
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:30,618
Rym: We replace most social most.

1078
01:04:30,638 --> 01:04:34,467
Rym: Well, not most social programs, but any social programs we can with the federal city.

1079
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:41,510
Rym: Oh So you saying we should cancel other federal we say no matter how bad your lot is.

1080
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,170
Rym: So you're saying like no more food stamps.

1081
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:46,486
Scott: If you don't even have enough money for food go to Detroit and there you can.

1082
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:47,210
Scott: then you can have food.

1083
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:48,289
Rym: There should still be food stamps.

1084
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:53,290
Rym: There should be a level between I need some help to get back on my feet and I have to go to Detroit.

1085
01:04:53,632 --> 01:04:54,717
Scott: I mean no more welfare.

1086
01:04:54,737 --> 01:04:59,905
Rym: the welfare is now go to Detroit but more like welfare Helps you out in that like welfare is the alright.

1087
01:05:00,005 --> 01:05:00,790
Rym: I live somewhere.

1088
01:05:01,214 --> 01:05:02,669
Rym: I need a little help to get back on my feet.

1089
01:05:03,312 --> 01:05:06,584
Rym: If after an amount of time you can't you still have not gotten back on your feet.

1090
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:08,250
Rym: Alright, no more welfare.

1091
01:05:08,331 --> 01:05:10,349
Rym: You've got to go to Detroit and then we guarantee your job.

1092
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:13,746
Scott: Detroit would just become like even like the worst place in the universe.

1093
01:05:13,787 --> 01:05:14,370
Scott: Maybe not.

1094
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:17,087
Scott: Well, so what are we gonna have those people do?

1095
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:23,390
Rym: Public infrastructure works to start and then from there they live in Detroit and we ship them off with the survey crew.

1096
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:25,419
Scott: Public infrastructure is not an export.

1097
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:26,906
Scott: So basically it's a whole bunch of money.

1098
01:05:26,946 --> 01:05:27,810
Scott: So you have a huge debt.

1099
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:32,214
Rym: So then data entry for the government recodifying the C We.

1100
01:05:32,274 --> 01:05:33,622
Rym: this is one of those grand plans.

1101
01:05:33,903 --> 01:05:35,009
Rym: stage one is set this up.

1102
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:43,876
Rym: Stage two is use this massive pool of cheap labor to do the data entry and the license plate making for my massive Rewriting and codification of US law.

1103
01:05:44,037 --> 01:05:48,630
Scott: I'm sure yeah thing is that requires smart people or well-directed people.

1104
01:05:49,671 --> 01:05:59,870
Scott: Also, you know people move there with their families and then you ship the the people who are who's gonna who's gonna go become like You need thing is you need also smart jobs there too to run things.

1105
01:06:00,393 --> 01:06:02,162
Scott: Who's smart is gonna want to go live there?

1106
01:06:02,384 --> 01:06:03,530
Rym: So here's what'll happen, right?

1107
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:08,854
Rym: So you've got this big city in Detroit and you've got people with guaranteed income Guaranteed jobs.

1108
01:06:08,914 --> 01:06:09,316
Scott: Oh, sorry.

1109
01:06:09,356 --> 01:06:11,426
Scott: So it's really communism those people.

1110
01:06:11,466 --> 01:06:12,210
Scott: Why would they even work?

1111
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:15,045
Scott: I would just sit home and to get the guaranteed income you have to work.

1112
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:15,770
Rym: You don't get the income.

1113
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:19,149
Rym: Yeah, you have to have a job, but I'll just do a bad job.

1114
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:21,958
Rym: Well, maybe then you make less income.

1115
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:22,862
Rym: Maybe we have communism.

1116
01:06:22,903 --> 01:06:24,450
Rym: You could still reward people a little bit more.

1117
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:26,403
Scott: Maybe you remember these people are not these people.

1118
01:06:26,564 --> 01:06:31,390
Scott: the reason that you know At least some of them the reason that they're poor is because they're just not good at things.

1119
01:06:31,952 --> 01:06:37,270
Rym: And the people are good go there get a job and also you offer free education and training in any life's gonna be the educators.

1120
01:06:37,872 --> 01:06:38,434
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

1121
01:06:38,515 --> 01:06:41,326
Rym: at first we offer large subsidies to convince people to move there.

1122
01:06:41,346 --> 01:06:44,550
Scott: Yeah This is sounds like you're just a big money hole.

1123
01:06:44,822 --> 01:06:46,656
Rym: No Cuz here's the thing you realize.

1124
01:06:46,696 --> 01:06:50,470
Rym: surrounding Detroit are some of the richest most prosperous suburbs in the country.

1125
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,413
Scott: Aren't they empty now?

1126
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:55,686
Rym: No, the suburbs are crazy for those people work in Detroit.

1127
01:06:55,706 --> 01:06:56,770
Rym: They just don't live in Detroit.

1128
01:06:57,352 --> 01:06:58,455
Scott: Isn't Detroit crumbling?

1129
01:06:58,655 --> 01:07:05,175
Rym: yes, yeah, but there are still offices down there and public infrastructure and things and also more and more There are businesses around the suburbs.

1130
01:07:05,636 --> 01:07:05,857
Scott: All right,

1131
01:07:06,238 --> 01:07:10,431
Rym: but yeah, those are some crazily economically prosperous places around there Mm-hmm,

1132
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:10,893
Scott: but

1133
01:07:11,255 --> 01:07:18,588
Rym: you basically no one no one from there would want to live in Detroit But they would live next to it and sell services to it

1134
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:19,452
Scott: Mmm,

1135
01:07:19,794 --> 01:07:22,869
Rym: and you basically be pumping money through Detroit and then back into the economy.

1136
01:07:23,852 --> 01:07:30,388
Rym: Cuz think about it right but then you had to get money back the other direction From a really sick cat because then it goes back into the economy and people pay taxes on it.

1137
01:07:30,729 --> 01:07:33,321
Rym: No Yeah, and think about this way.

1138
01:07:33,563 --> 01:07:34,670
Rym: Here's a really cynical thing.

1139
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:37,830
Rym: I'm about to say these kinds of people are gonna end up in Detroit or not?

1140
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,668
Rym: The kinds of people are gonna save that money.

1141
01:07:43,011 --> 01:07:46,790
Rym: But anyway, I actually have a much more detailed and less crazy planned.

1142
01:07:47,112 --> 01:07:56,107
Scott: I think a much less crazy plan would be this if you were to Legalize drugs then you could just say yes drugs are legal, but all drug factories must be in Detroit.

1143
01:07:56,127 --> 01:07:59,558
Rym: Ah Detroit's the special economic zone for hemp production.

1144
01:07:59,598 --> 01:08:04,950
Scott: So they grow all the weed wherever then grow it anywhere growing's, you know Fine, let it let them grow wherever they want.

1145
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:10,490
Scott: But the all the packaging and manual labor must be in Detroit and Detroit will become like the weed capital.

1146
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:12,197
Rym: Ah Detroit weed City.

1147
01:08:12,377 --> 01:08:17,078
Scott: Yep, and then that's actually, you know much better than Manual labor of.

1148
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:18,888
Scott: you know law writing, you know.

1149
01:08:19,374 --> 01:08:25,750
Scott: We could just have people Sticking weed in boxes and then those same people would buy and smoke the weed that they package and they would be fine.

1150
01:08:25,911 --> 01:08:33,560
Rym: that raises ethical questions of getting people addicted to a drug and then making them work to create that drug at a profit for You and then they spend all the money you pay them on the drug.

1151
01:08:34,202 --> 01:08:38,322
Scott: if the person just gonna be a homeless bum forever I think that's better to just live in weed City.

1152
01:08:38,564 --> 01:08:43,648
Scott: Anyway package weed Anyway, so no actually they probably know a lot about it.

1153
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:44,591
Rym: Moral.

1154
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:46,157
Scott: the third they know about computers.

1155
01:08:46,519 --> 01:08:51,073
Rym: aside from you know, not entangling your affairs with people like this Steal bikes.

1156
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:52,278
Rym: It's trivial to steal bikes.

1157
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,161
Rym: No one will stop you.

1158
01:08:53,221 --> 01:08:55,290
Scott: Yeah, why should I even buy a bike in the spring?

1159
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,930
Scott: I'm just gonna like find like a really nice one and steal it.

1160
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:58,455
Rym: I guess you can't.

1161
01:08:58,475 --> 01:09:02,680
Rym: you got to steal it from like Cold Spring You know, that's the sure.

1162
01:09:02,701 --> 01:09:03,770
Scott: I can't steal one from the city.

1163
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:07,684
Scott: I'll have to go like off into the middle of nowhere and steal one of the city.

1164
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:09,149
Rym: There's so many identical bikes.

1165
01:09:10,171 --> 01:09:12,460
Scott: Well, the thing is you get you might get caught there.

1166
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,970
Scott: there's a lot more eyeballs, you know, I gotta find out now.

1167
01:09:15,078 --> 01:09:25,149
Rym: No Emily was telling me that recent an experiment dude would chain a bike up in like Populated crowded parts of the city like Astor place and then come back like a few days later and hacks all the thing off.

1168
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:25,658
Rym: I just take it.

1169
01:09:26,612 --> 01:09:27,537
Rym: No, no one cared.

1170
01:09:27,657 --> 01:09:28,442
Rym: No one even looked at him.

1171
01:09:28,763 --> 01:09:34,470
Scott: Yeah The thing the thing you got to worry about though is like I'm gonna be looking if I'm gonna steal a bike.

1172
01:09:34,894 --> 01:09:36,630
Scott: I'm gonna steal a nice bike.

1173
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:40,644
Scott: I'm not gonna bother going to the effort of stealing for some cheapo crap bike.

1174
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:42,350
Scott: I'm gonna go for like the fancy bike.

1175
01:09:42,856 --> 01:09:46,349
Scott: So if I'm gonna do that The guy who rides it might come back.

1176
01:09:47,335 --> 01:09:48,328
Scott: So I gotta do it.

1177
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,189
Scott: You know one where I know the guy isn't coming in the time.

1178
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,997
Scott: It takes a hexa further moral.

1179
01:09:53,399 --> 01:10:05,610
Rym: if you're gonna chain up a bike that you stole at least To have it not all rely on one link, dude Could we maybe like make like a like a bike chain that actually fucking works and can't be hexa?

1180
01:10:05,912 --> 01:10:07,161
Rym: Anything can be hacksaw.

1181
01:10:07,221 --> 01:10:07,362
Rym: No.

1182
01:10:07,382 --> 01:10:08,309
Scott: No, I mean like.

1183
01:10:09,132 --> 01:10:12,110
Scott: What if you made it out of the same stuff you make a hacksaw out of can you hacksaw?

1184
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:13,980
Rym: Hey, yes, you can act saw hacksaw.

1185
01:10:14,101 --> 01:10:15,047
Scott: What if we made it?

1186
01:10:15,088 --> 01:10:15,430
Rym: you Scott?

1187
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:19,009
Rym: What I will hacksaw through a hacksaw blade if you want, why don't we?

1188
01:10:20,293 --> 01:10:23,155
Scott: Make an electrified Bike chain.

1189
01:10:23,176 --> 01:10:26,948
Scott: So if you try to hack saw it, it shocks you Just have a taser bike.

1190
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:35,415
Scott: Exactly it like right in the middle of the chain is an electric wire as a battery and if you'd hacksaw through the middle It'll just freakin knock you out.

1191
01:10:35,455 --> 01:10:36,358
Rym: So I cut the battery off.

1192
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,485
Scott: first the batteries in the chain.

1193
01:10:38,886 --> 01:10:40,110
Rym: So then I wear gloves.

1194
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:47,410
Scott: Yeah An exploding bike chain if you cut through it is actually just an exploding bike.

1195
01:10:48,853 --> 01:10:49,846
Rym: Steal the bike it blows up.

1196
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:52,649
Scott: How do we put a GPS in the frame?

1197
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,393
Rym: You're gonna spend that much money on a bike if it's a fancy bike.

1198
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:58,017
Scott: It'll be worth it.

1199
01:10:58,057 --> 01:10:59,546
Scott: if you buy like a $1,000 is not a fancy bike.

1200
01:11:02,361 --> 01:11:05,573
Scott: It would be worth it if I had $1,000 bike even though it's not that fancy.

1201
01:11:05,593 --> 01:11:06,195
Rym: that bike is $1,000 bike.

1202
01:11:08,045 --> 01:11:09,640
Scott: They'll be worth it to have a GPS in there.

1203
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,766
Rym: Yeah, you should come to the bike store.

1204
01:11:10,786 --> 01:11:12,092
Rym: If you want to buy a new bike they have those $2,000.

1205
01:11:12,092 --> 01:11:12,716
Scott: I've seen Scott.

1206
01:11:13,761 --> 01:11:16,590
Rym: No, I test rode a $18,000.

1207
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:18,576
Scott: What the hell could it possibly be made of?

1208
01:11:18,797 --> 01:11:19,880
Scott: made of gold penises?

1209
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:20,401
Scott: I don't know.

1210
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,386
Rym: It was made of titanium.

1211
01:11:21,446 --> 01:11:22,088
Rym: It weighed nothing.

1212
01:11:22,129 --> 01:11:25,322
Rym: I could pick this whole bike up with like one finger upside down Uh-huh.

1213
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:27,653
Rym: It was a full-on even with the tires.

1214
01:11:27,874 --> 01:11:30,182
Rym: Yeah with a full suspension Mm-hmm.

1215
01:11:30,443 --> 01:11:36,060
Rym: This was the bike like ride down a ski slope mountain like rocky craziness.

1216
01:11:36,261 --> 01:11:40,160
Scott: You see a lot of the bikes have gimmicks that are just like for yuppies and don't aren't really helpful.

1217
01:11:40,434 --> 01:11:41,885
Rym: No This was a real mountain bike like.

1218
01:11:41,905 --> 01:11:50,055
Rym: it had this system where because you have this problem of loss when you ride a bike with A full suspension where the suspension moves and it takes energy away from your riding.

1219
01:11:50,075 --> 01:11:51,460
Rym: That's why I like to ride a hardtail bike.

1220
01:11:51,501 --> 01:11:55,211
Rym: There's no rear suspension So I have more power to put into my riding.

1221
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:57,740
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I like the feel of it and all that it kind of bounces.

1222
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:10,337
Rym: So if you have a really fancy bike you can have these incredibly complex Systems that will only allow the suspension to engage when there is a movement from the bottom and first on the bottom But not from the top.

1223
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,285
Scott: Mmm, that's real fancy.

1224
01:12:12,305 --> 01:12:16,537
Rym: Yes, and it's like this crazy pneumatic system and that system was like five grand by itself.

1225
01:12:16,817 --> 01:12:19,168
Scott: Whoa Well, I can do mad.

1226
01:12:19,289 --> 01:12:20,335
Rym: Oh, it worked though.

1227
01:12:20,496 --> 01:12:21,200
Rym: I rode the bike.

1228
01:12:21,521 --> 01:12:26,220
Rym: I like rode over like these crazy rocks and didn't even feel him like it was an amazing bike.

1229
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:28,208
Scott: Yeah, you know that like that pride.

1230
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:28,972
Scott: beyond that where is $18,000?

1231
01:12:28,972 --> 01:12:33,894
Scott: obviously not gonna buy it But just imagine like riding around the city and it's like just.

1232
01:12:34,075 --> 01:12:39,193
Scott: it's like you're riding a bike But it's smooth like riding in like a Lincoln town car or a Cadillac.

1233
01:12:39,494 --> 01:12:39,715
Rym: All right.

1234
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:41,400
Rym: Anyway, we've gone on way too long.

1235
01:12:41,601 --> 01:12:42,364
Scott: We needed to go along.

1236
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:43,569
Scott: We haven't done an episode of forever.

1237
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,236
Rym: So let's end this now.

1238
01:12:45,357 --> 01:12:45,959
Scott: It's 2000 forever.

1239
01:12:46,925 --> 01:12:48,999
Rym: So with the moral of this don't lock it.

1240
01:12:49,941 --> 01:12:51,969
Rym: Don't leave your bike on lock as a visual thief up.

1241
01:12:52,009 --> 01:12:53,174
Scott: Don't steal bikes.

1242
01:12:53,455 --> 01:12:54,740
Scott: Don't get your bike stolen.

1243
01:12:55,361 --> 01:12:56,946
Scott: Don't actually shoot homeless people.

1244
01:12:57,487 --> 01:13:01,458
Rym: Yes, don't entangle your affairs with people who are poor and indigent.

1245
01:13:01,819 --> 01:13:04,828
Rym: Yep Poor and no stupid and indigent.

1246
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:07,940
Rym: Yeah, not poor and indigent because they're cool people who are poor and indigent.

1247
01:13:08,121 --> 01:13:11,240
Rym: So stupid and indigent do not entangle your affairs, right?

1248
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:17,067
Rym: And if you are if you confront someone who stole your bike Bluff that you called the police.

1249
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:20,478
Rym: if you have not already called the police, but be ready for dick punching.
