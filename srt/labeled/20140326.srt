1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:24,280
Rym: It's Wednesday March 26th 2014 I'm Rym it's really cold And this is GeekNights tonight warm today, and we're talking about yamishibai Gary urban legend Japanese horror story anime on crunchyroll.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,580
Scott: Not yamishibai, I don't think it's ie I think it's yamishibai yamishibai Yamishibai no jikanda yo.

3
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:43,597
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:45,840
Rym: So yeah, we're back from anime, Boston.

5
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:59,140
Rym: there was a time in an ancient past where we would review every convention we went to but an Average packs is not significantly different enough from the previous packs to say anything at length about it.

6
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,340
Scott: There's not a full episodes worth of things to say that we haven't already said multiple times in the past.

7
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,470
Scott: So you can just go listen to an old episode of any particular convention And you won't have to worry about there not being a new one.

8
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:12,960
Rym: yep like but this pet this anime, Boston.

9
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:13,905
Rym: You know good.

10
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:14,628
Rym: anime, Boston.

11
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,915
Rym: few things were different.

12
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:16,940
Rym: few things were noteworthy.

13
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:21,056
Rym: So as my news talk a little bit about what happened there, so we did our four panels.

14
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:21,658
Rym: They went great.

15
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:27,763
Rym: Interestingly the one that got the biggest line was the not all anime or what they seem Like.

16
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:36,771
Rym: scarily people lined up way in advance for that and they turned a bunch of people away Q of people hanging out outside Trying to get in if anyone walked out.

17
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,200
Rym: It's like why really that's the one they picked.

18
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:45,702
Rym: But the funny thing was unlike our other panels where half the audience is like already knew who we were and they were there just Because of us.

19
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:48,510
Rym: the people in this panel mostly didn't know who we were.

20
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:53,809
Rym: so the power of choosing a provocative title Once again is proven.

21
00:01:54,272 --> 00:02:01,040
Rym: if you want to get people to come to your panel Think was gonna be at that panel that they wanted in so badly not all animator what they seem.

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,408
Rym: Maybe they thought we're gonna talk about anime that look like one thing, but really there's something else Which is kind of what we did.

23
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,180
Rym: kind wasn't much of a bait-and-switch?

24
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:10,556
Rym: Not really.

25
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:17,300
Scott: So yeah this anime Boston notable differences from previous anime, Boston's.

26
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:22,065
Scott: first of all the jam project was the Musical guest.

27
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:25,880
Scott: right yeah, they did like two concerts on Friday night.

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,569
Scott: They did like all jam project together, and then on Saturday.

29
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:31,860
Scott: They did like individual whatever's which is that's new.

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,667
Scott: It's like they did so much concert compared to other musical guests that have appeared in your actions, but We didn't go.

31
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:44,600
Rym: yeah the thing is we thought oh We won't be able to go because we didn't arrive until Friday morning.

32
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:55,040
Rym: Yeah, so we wouldn't be able to get the wristbands, but it was kind of sad that there were staff going around Desperately trying to get people to take the wristbands or whatever to go to the concert.

33
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:56,246
Scott: Yeah, that was a surprise.

34
00:02:56,387 --> 00:03:02,217
Scott: usually you know when you have that kind of wristband situation It's like people will line up like crazy, but I guess they didn't need to.

35
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:03,422
Scott: you know I don't know.

36
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:05,270
Scott: I don't know why they did that.

37
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,660
Scott: It's like they never really had a problem in recent years.

38
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:16,420
Rym: Because for example here's two scenarios you have a good system to deal with a huge crowd and a huge crowd doesn't show up.

39
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,440
Rym: No problem you have a huge system and a huge crowd shows up.

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,952
Rym: No problem a huge crowd shows up, and you don't have a good system.

41
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:24,735
Rym: disaster.

42
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,200
Scott: It wasn't a disaster preview.

43
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,239
Scott: I mean they just lined up and went in the room.

44
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:31,913
Scott: You know I've never seen the concert for anime Boston Phil.

45
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:37,176
Rym: Oh near capacity, so Well that that space is actually pretty big.

46
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,341
Rym: That's what I'm saying I do.

47
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:41,271
Rym: I wish somehow that that space existed inside of the BCE.

48
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:43,980
Scott: see I wish they would remove the seats from that space.

49
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,434
Rym: Yeah, when Pax removed the seats that space held off fuck metric ton of people.

50
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:51,262
Scott: right then you wouldn't need to do any sort of Ridiculous you would.

51
00:03:51,322 --> 00:04:08,800
Rym: you couldn't possibly have a crowd big enough, but basically every year anime Boston since the bombings Has had ridiculous security yeah, and it's gotten to the point that it actually Significantly affected our ability to enjoy the con and our ability to record our panels.

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,079
Rym: So Friday we literally almost missed running our first panel because getting through security was such a hassle.

53
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:17,700
Scott: Well, and the bus was a little bit late.

54
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,925
Scott: Yeah, the bus was a little late, but mostly the bus was late enough But there was a little bit of traffic But that would have been fine.

55
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:26,240
Scott: the bus also decided to stop at a Wendy's for no reason yeah.

56
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,080
Scott: So bolt bus I have to write an email to bolt bus.

57
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:37,650
Scott: I'm gonna say listen There is no reason for pretty much any of the trips between New York and Boston in New York DC or New York To ever stop anywhere ever.

58
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,960
Scott: it was telling those trips in one shot.

59
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,790
Scott: The bus was right through him on the bus.

60
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,020
Rym: the bus was running about 15 minutes late And they stopped at that Wendy's for like 15 minutes, huh?

61
00:04:48,902 --> 00:05:02,279
Rym: And then of course like three people get back on the bus reeking of cigarette smoke so that made it just all the more enjoyable right, and then you know they Yeah, yep, yeah, yep, but the security was bad for a lot of reasons.

62
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,400
Rym: one It wasn't just like last year where they kind of glanced at my bag and walked me through.

63
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:14,307
Rym: They sat there and made me open every individual zipper inside and outside of my bag And they rifled around every pocket.

64
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,815
Rym: it took almost some minutes at one point.

65
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:17,839
Scott: It was so inconsistent.

66
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:27,320
Scott: sometimes They just feel like they'd look and they make I go and sometimes They'd be like hmm I'm gonna pretend to look like I'm looking through everything and then not actually really look through everything.

67
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,386
Scott: So it's it's fake security.

68
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:34,560
Scott: and then of course at like one entrance like the one that goes to the street They've got like metal detecting wands.

69
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,417
Rym: Yeah They did metal detector pat-downs of every single person who walked in through entrance a but not through any other entrance ever.

70
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:42,409
Rym: and when I when I asked the people there.

71
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:47,200
Rym: I asked the security people I think I even got a video of this on my glass cuz I actually recorded video of a lot of the security.

72
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,140
Rym: Do you guys realize that they're not doing this to any of the other?

73
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,642
Rym: Entrances.

74
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:56,985
Rym: and they looked at me, and they looked at each other and they actually look kind of shocked right But nothing changed.

75
00:05:57,165 --> 00:06:03,867
Rym: no also those people I want to point out they rifled through my bag for multiple minutes And they gave me the metal detector pat-down.

76
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:08,998
Rym: the metal detector went off like four times on me And they did not investigate that at any point.

77
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:10,867
Rym: Yeah, in fact it went off on.

78
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:13,900
Rym: what I had in my back pocket was a huge lithium-ion battery.

79
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:17,270
Scott: I don't think they care if you have a battery But they didn't look to see what it was.

80
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,720
Rym: they basically they took the metal detector.

81
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,659
Rym: They waved it around me it went off on a bunch of spots, and they ignored it mm-hmm.

82
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:29,340
Rym: so Like I said on Twitter if you're gonna have security theater at least put some shit backstage guys.

83
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:30,425
Scott: What was the?

84
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,115
Scott: what was the joke right?

85
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:33,040
Scott: What was the well?

86
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,925
Rym: Yeah, I was very proud of this joke.

87
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:35,607
Rym: what?

88
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:36,389
Rym: which theater had?

89
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,596
Rym: the longest lines that anime Boston this year?

90
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:39,619
Scott: the security theater?

91
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,840
Rym: oh So that was bad, but it was manageable.

92
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:50,293
Rym: But as a result once we left the convention center like to get dinner We really didn't want to go back into the con.

93
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:51,340
Rym: so we almost right.

94
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:53,188
Scott: It's like a pain in the ass to go back in.

95
00:06:53,249 --> 00:07:03,260
Scott: so it's like once you're in you're in and once you're out you're out Whereas before I'd be like in and out and in and out So either to carry my equipment with me all day, or does not bring it so we basically stopped videoing our panels.

96
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,940
Scott: Yeah, cuz we have to carry like a tripod and all this shit through the security.

97
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,366
Scott: Yeah, huge pain in multiple bags with a lot of equipment that they're gonna rifle through now apparently right It's like well I just won't carry it in.

98
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:16,663
Scott: I carried in as little as possible But then it got worse.

99
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:23,551
Rym: so on Sunday the line to get in was literally you just couldn't get through it at first Like it was blocking and even go in on Sunday.

100
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:24,878
Rym: Yeah, exactly we didn't go in.

101
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,317
Rym: so The main reason we didn't go in is because you couldn't get in.

102
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:28,900
Rym: with security.

103
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,473
Rym: They wouldn't let people with big bags in at all.

104
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:32,679
Scott: is that what it was?

105
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:35,199
Scott: yes And I thought they just there was a pain in the ass to check them.

106
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:36,082
Rym: No, no So they wouldn't.

107
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,333
Rym: so if you had a big luggage they basically just wouldn't let you in.

108
00:07:38,353 --> 00:07:43,281
Rym: and if you had a luggage that for Whatever reason they would let you in they went through it Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:48,357
Rym: so people had to check their bags the hotel wouldn't let you check directly because I mean anime Boston.

110
00:07:48,497 --> 00:08:03,540
Scott: every year that I've been There has turned the registration room in the hotel into sort of a free bag check room for all the attendees which brilliant Which is great, but the thing is because of the security that room was much more heavily utilized than in past years.

111
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:07,789
Scott: So like to even get into the con on Sunday And there isn't much con on Sunday.

112
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:15,420
Scott: you had to check your bag in there And then get through the unless you're staying in another hotel or something, but even then you're probably checking out on Sunday.

113
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:25,639
Scott: It's not a con where you're gonna check out Monday, so yeah It made Sunday like not worth it to go into the con on Sunday like unless you're like someone who lives in Boston walking off the street.

114
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,587
Rym: So it was unprecedented.

115
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:30,094
Rym: usually we show up at cons Thursday night.

116
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,400
Rym: We leave like late Sunday afternoon.

117
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:37,312
Rym: I don't think I'm ever gonna go to anime Boston on Sunday again like we just won't do panels on Sunday We won't.

118
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:43,380
Scott: yeah It's like we showed up sort of late ish Friday like middle of the day And we didn't do anything at the con at all on Sunday.

119
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:47,559
Rym: So as a result I gave my badge away to our waitress.

120
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:51,780
Scott: I Thought about I was just gonna give her my badge, but you wanted to keep it for.

121
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:56,360
Scott: But then she said then she actually reminded me like doesn't have sentimental value, and I'm like shit.

122
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,813
Scott: I guess I do have every convention badge ever and that will break the streak won't it?

123
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:01,620
Rym: do you have your Ohio con?

124
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,804
Rym: 2002 badge?

125
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:07,183
Rym: probably yeah, I think I do too, so this is the only badge I don't have.

126
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:16,457
Rym: and I took an empty sleeve and I wrote on a piece of paper Gave badge to waitress at Trident cafe, and so I'll remember that that happens.

127
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:17,360
Scott: good enough also.

128
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:18,751
Rym: She knows who we are me.

129
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:24,880
Rym: if she might email us and be like hey I went to the con maybe and if she does then I'll ask her to mail my badge back.

130
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,071
Rym: I'll be like I'll give you a dollar if you mail it back to me.

131
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:28,680
Rym: Yeah, I'll pay for your postage.

132
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,591
Scott: We'll see you next year at the Trident actually will be.

133
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:32,956
Scott: we can go back there during packs.

134
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:33,618
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

135
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:36,932
Rym: yeah We couldn't get a hotel anywhere near packs.

136
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,400
Scott: our hotel is near the tried anything.

137
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:40,760
Rym: Yeah, it's basically the worst possible location.

138
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,114
Rym: That's so the only other bad thing and we're trying to get the bad stuff out.

139
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:46,880
Rym: first because anime Boston was still fun.

140
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,564
Rym: Is that though?

141
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:55,020
Rym: they've always had problems in the connected hotel with the elevators, but it was kind of a party.

142
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:57,379
Rym: It was especially bad this year.

143
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,252
Scott: Boston's fault necessarily is the hotel is bad elevator.

144
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:03,516
Scott: so did that magfest hotel.

145
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,480
Scott: so of a lot of hotels You know they have conventions in them.

146
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,889
Scott: They can't handle people you know they're does?

147
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,602
Scott: they're not designed for all these people to go up and back and forth to their rooms Constantly.

148
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:14,890
Rym: so my advice to all of you.

149
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:18,848
Scott: I'm not gonna tell you our secrets, but actually this is an anime Boston of secrets.

150
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,580
Scott: right we had a secret breakfast.

151
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,684
Scott: We have always been there.

152
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:25,540
Scott: we had a secret entrance to get into the con with a minimal security line.

153
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,195
Scott: Yeah, right we had a secret way to get up and down the building That you know decides waiting for an elevator.

154
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,565
Rym: Yeah, right That was a pretty good way.

155
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:41,125
Rym: that was the only way I was able to get up and down the elevator at the disastrous Anime central.

156
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,513
Rym: what 2003 right 2003 or 2004 that anime central.

157
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:48,233
Scott: good God There are just so many secrets at this anime Boston.

158
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:49,660
Scott: It was the convention of secrets.

159
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:54,783
Rym: It was also the secret of where the fucker Rym and Scott because when we weren't doing our panels We literally just left.

160
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,833
Rym: I went to one event at the entire con.

161
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,157
Rym: that was my tools anime hell.

162
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:00,000
Scott: I went to anime hell.

163
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,546
Scott: So it was hellish.

164
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,113
Rym: good things about the con.

165
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,680
Rym: our panels were very well attended.

166
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:06,526
Rym: The stuff you know.

167
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:21,110
Rym: everything went great on that front other than like weird Contractor running the panel room in the hotel who despite the con and Lou very specifically saying VGA Which is what every projector in the world anywhere uses.

168
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:23,296
Rym: this guy was all super weird.

169
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:23,597
Rym: He was like.

170
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:24,599
Rym: I don't have VGA.

171
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:30,500
Rym: oh I can't run the cable to the table cuz I gotta get out like 50 cables to do that.

172
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:34,811
Rym: Just give me your slides, and I'll use my Mac here to display him.

173
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:36,716
Rym: Oh what you have a PDF.

174
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:37,980
Rym: I don't have PDF reader.

175
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,089
Scott: Well he does it mean it's a Mac has preview.

176
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,722
Rym: Yeah, but he was like really resistant to the PDF He's like.

177
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:44,127
Rym: What do you mean?

178
00:11:44,147 --> 00:11:45,200
Rym: You don't have a PowerPoint?

179
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,839
Rym: But like this guy was just really kind of weirdly.

180
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,985
Scott: I guess for some reason.

181
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:53,540
Scott: in the hotel they have to have union guys do it and in the convention center anime Boston people do.

182
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,976
Rym: Yeah, so we'll talk to the con on the side, but yeah basically pretty sure they can.

183
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:01,680
Scott: it's probably some read rule They can't have the anime Boston people do it in the hotel.

184
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:02,072
Scott: They have.

185
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:02,197
Scott: yeah.

186
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:10,040
Rym: But the trouble is Lou sends out an email that says use VGA You can plug your laptop in on the table unless you're in constitution or in the one of the hotel ballroom.

187
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:13,510
Rym: Yeah, so if you're in the hotel You're basically fucked and got to just bring enough stuff to make do.

188
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,498
Rym: it actually made our panel really hard to do.

189
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:15,919
Rym: you're lucky.

190
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,127
Scott: you Had your laptop had many display for it.

191
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:21,520
Scott: Yeah, which I thought I had regular display for it, but it didn't yep.

192
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:23,147
Rym: But even then like we're also lucky.

193
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:23,910
Rym: I had a clicker.

194
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,059
Rym: Yeah, and we're lucky.

195
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,285
Rym: well We're not lucky the truck.

196
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:34,300
Rym: the main trouble was we plan all our panels Assuming that we'll have a monitor screen to look at on stage.

197
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:35,967
Rym: So we didn't have that.

198
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,880
Rym: so we couldn't read the text easily on our panel.

199
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:43,540
Scott: I had to keep looking up to the left and the whole point and only really mattered for that panel.

200
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,793
Rym: Yeah, the whole point of that panel is that we don't know what's on the slides ahead of time.

201
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:47,094
Rym: right.

202
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:48,580
Scott: so the only panel.

203
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:50,787
Rym: But yeah anime hell was great.

204
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:54,819
Rym: and also Mike tool has inspired us because we used to give everyone.

205
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,165
Rym: we knew I'm a danger.

206
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,048
Rym: We gave everyone.

207
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,780
Rym: Oh my god shake hands with danger danger.

208
00:13:01,262 --> 00:13:10,314
Rym: we used to give everyone an anime con shit for just not having their shit together and Anime hell was literally the cleanest smoothest most polished anime.

209
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,020
Rym: Hell I have ever seen in my life.

210
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:13,219
Scott: Yeah, you played the videos.

211
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,960
Scott: They just played in a row without seeing any wallpapers or backgrounds or fussing with computer.

212
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,306
Rym: Yeah, he had the timing set.

213
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:22,617
Rym: he could pause it and do his commentary in between.

214
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:23,220
Rym: it was brilliant.

215
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:25,049
Scott: Yeah, and it's how it's done.

216
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,396
Rym: He leapfrogged us.

217
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:29,540
Rym: We've said for years We're gonna buy a lavalier system and just bring it to cons.

218
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,162
Rym: You got one.

219
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:33,837
Scott: he bought a lot on Amazon, but he had the receiver and stuff.

220
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:35,906
Rym: so yep And the con let him do it.

221
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:37,474
Rym: so stay tuned.

222
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:42,233
Rym: coming conventions Scott And I might be wearing the same microphones that TED talk people wear.

223
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,137
Scott: They're expensive.

224
00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:46,602
Scott: Oh my god We're gonna spend more like three hundred dollars each And that doesn't?

225
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:47,968
Scott: that only counts the microphone part.

226
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:54,231
Rym: this microphone kit will cost more than the gigantic Mackey we use to do GeekNights cost more than a 4k video camera.

227
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:59,948
Rym: yep, so exciting times there Mike tool You've inspired us and also that was a great anime.

00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:18,356
Scott: I mean it was.

237
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,986
Scott: there was plenty of it right There wasn't definitely not a shortage.

238
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,874
Rym: I think Tony was the majority.

239
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:24,139
Scott: still it wasn't like.

240
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:27,840
Scott: yeah There was a lot of but it wasn't some like ridiculous dominating percentage.

241
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:31,212
Scott: It's not like in the conventions of old like I for some reason.

242
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:35,769
Scott: I didn't count them right so I have no statistics to back This up, but in like the Naruto heyday.

243
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,311
Rym: Oh my god.

00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:37,134
Scott: It felt like.

245
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:40,788
Scott: it felt like a good 25 to 50 percent was Naruto.

246
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:42,876
Rym: I remember and I think I have a picture nowadays.

247
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:43,880

Scott: Yeah, also the The athletic club Elite four guy.

287
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:44,040
Scott: I mean there was at least one or two of him, but that's the least popular Elite four.

288
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:45,720
Scott: Yeah, I apparently.

289
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:49,980
Rym: So we did another thing and we'll have coverage of this later.

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,600
Rym: We did some cool stuff at the con some experimentation for future cons.

291
00:16:52,721 --> 00:17:01,513
Rym: but we asked a lot of people around the con some questions and ConnectiCon as another con they all go to was surprisingly really high on the list.

292
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:01,633
Scott: Well.

293
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:06,972
Scott: It's geographically close it is Players and ConnectiCon has a lot of cosplay.

294
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,050
Rym: so at the same time we talked to one guy And we're like blah blah Connecticut.

295
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,915
Rym: He's like where's that?

296
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,771
Rym: It's on the moon, but we asked people like what anime they're into.

297
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:31,240
Rym: most of the people we talked to Named a wide array of anime except the one guy who was like Solita, Naruto Darker than black blood lad, whatever.

298
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:36,617
Scott: People are all over the map in terms of their favorite animes, but something beautiful happened.

299
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:40,329
Rym: the last question We asked everyone was so what is homestuck?

300
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:47,174
Rym: and without fail every single one of them responded like this Well some people were like I don't know.

301
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:55,660
Rym: some people were like Yeah, it's a webcomic I don't want to explain anymore But there was just this if they if they legit didn't know they said I don't know.

302
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:07,759
Scott: But everyone else even if they said I don't know had this sharp intake of breath Even to even describe what it is is like this labor right and that tells you everything you need to know about what it is.

303
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:15,287
Rym: So the last thing that was kind of funny is that we did our fundamental anime panel Which is basically a recycle of.

304
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:16,552
Rym: we have a format of panel.

305
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:25,046
Rym: That's basically here's a list of anime We want to recommend and we have a generic title for it, so we did fundamental anime Which is to take on anime you should see.

306
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:29,260
Rym: so some website covered it and gave our list which is cool.

307
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:46,280
Scott: Yeah I guess there was someone in the room who writes or submitted to some link bait website that just like you know just tries to get content to get clicks and whatever right and So they did a write-up of that panel, and they it's basically like top ten animes.

308
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,269
Scott: Oh my god, right which is cool.

309
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,817
Scott: Which is why our panel is uh?

310
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:54,435
Rym: It removed some of the nuance of our recommendations.

311
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:57,967
Rym: so for example Yeah, it's like it's someone who said they updated it.

312
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:06,906
Rym: it no longer says started the magical girl genre for antenna Okay, now says galvanized And served as inspiration for count.

313
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:09,112
Scott: okay, so that's 100% sure.

314
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:10,697
Scott: it's better than started.

315
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:11,660
Scott: sure so they.

316
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:19,420
Scott: But it's like someone just sat in the room and just basically paraphrase paraphrased and wrote whatever which is actually a hundred percent cool.

317
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:23,827
Rym: It's fine if they do that I don't give a shit yeah But it was funny that I got a lot of to.

318
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:28,024
Scott: really Rym is like making a big deal out of this and like it's just Some little website.

319
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:30,755
Rym: Why is everyone freaking out who's doesn't make it a big deal about it.

320
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:33,968
Scott: You're talking about it Yeah, because it's not even worth noticing.

321
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:46,246
Rym: It's because it's funny to watch someone paraphrase us and Seeing sort of how the filter breaks down very rapidly or like on the list like for example if you just look at the list Of anime you recommended.

322
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:48,320
Rym: we recommended Domiko dobutsu.

323
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,500
Rym: It's like really that's a fundamental anime.

324
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,100
Rym: And it's not because when we recommended that we recommended it as like.

325
00:19:55,622 --> 00:20:04,700
Rym: This is an example of the short format shows that nobody would think to watch Like this weird stuff kind of like the show we're reviewing today Mm-hmm.

326
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:07,938
Rym: But yeah all in all good panels good con other than the security theater.

327
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:08,360
Rym: bullshit.

328
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:14,039
Rym: If the security continues like if it's it's just as bad next year as it was last year.

329
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:20,558
Rym: Honestly thinking about reconsidering continuing to attend anime Boston because I'm just not cool with what's going down in the

330
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:37,739
Scott: hinds Yeah, I mean, it's like we went and it's like the four panels We did were really good and that whole part was great, but everything else about it was sort of like There's good things going on, but the amount of effort required to go there You know by pay for a hotel room and such it's sort of not necessarily worth it

331
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:38,180
Rym: Yep.

332
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:41,640
Rym: And the security kind of just really pushed it over the line into.

333
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:44,378
Rym: Gotta reevaluate if we're gonna continue to go every year.

334
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:47,852
Rym: But anime Boston has almost no control over that.

335
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,260
Rym: you got to complain to the city of Boston.

336
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,010
Scott: Yeah, we gotta get a right letters to the mayor of Boston.

337
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:56,726
Scott: cuz I point out packs does not have this problem No, and they're in Boston as well.

338
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:57,087
Scott: Yep.

339
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,718
Rym: Also other similarly sized events do not have this problem.

340
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,731
Scott: Nope Okay, so just a quick news.

341
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:05,120
Scott: That is not anime Boston.

342
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:09,814
Scott: The mocha is coming up April 5 and 6 in New York.

343
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:17,414
Scott: We go to that shit every year You know, there's some drama surrounding it since that Society of illustrators acquisition and whatever.

344
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:22,029
Rym: but most people we know who used to go aren't going Anymore, they didn't sell all the tables right away.

345
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,674
Rym: Yeah, I'm really down on it.

346
00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:25,560
Scott: Well, no, none of that stuff matters.

347
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,040
Scott: What does matter is the guest list, right?

348
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:32,232
Scott: And usually the guest list for mocha is like and who?

349
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:32,633
Scott: really?

350
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:34,460
Scott: you know, it's a bunch of indie people.

351
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:38,520
Scott: Maybe some of them are really cool, but they've got like eight panels at this convention.

352
00:21:39,124 --> 00:21:41,540
Scott: It's not a real, you know, it's like what does it guess to me?

353
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,200
Scott: And it means autographs and you see the person maybe you buy their book that just came out something like that, right?

354
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:54,415
Scott: But on the list is a very important person who's hot right now Fiona Staples artist on saga.

355
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:58,015
Scott: Ah So it's like someone who would be at a real comic convention.

356
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,667
Rym: Yeah Better format comic convention, right?

357
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,812
Scott: You can actually go see her.

358
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:06,245
Scott: So it's like yeah, let's Let's do that.

359
00:22:06,547 --> 00:22:08,500
Scott: Yeah somewhat more reason to go.

360
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:09,604
Rym: I'm a comics.

361
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:14,260
Rym: I'm still excited about mocha partly because I just take the subway to it's right there.

362
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:18,700
Scott: I know right what convention is better and you can have a really crappy convention if I can take the subway.

363
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,178
Rym: Yeah, if I can take you out the subway to your con, I'm probably going to your con.

364
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:25,875
Rym: granted I skipped the last recess, but I skipped a lot of recesses.

365
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:26,920
Rym: Yeah you and your netrunner.

366
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:36,056
Rym: So things of the day.

367
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:48,550
Rym: this is a compilation video but is a compilation video of Dogs who have had their beds stolen by cats Reacting to this situation just to hit the cat and then get in the bed.

368
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,650
Scott: Yeah, some of the dogs are not the cat to death and then sit in the bed.

369
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:52,416
Rym: Yeah, so they're nice.

370
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,230
Rym: Like if you're in my bed, am I gonna bite you to death?

371
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,374
Rym: No, I'm gonna be like get the fuck out of my bed But it's market.

372
00:22:57,394 --> 00:22:58,438
Scott: you're real fucking loud.

373
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,823
Scott: If you're still in the bed, then I'll bite you.

374
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,670
Scott: Yep, but it's all you can't really say.

375
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:06,370
Rym: Like one dog is about the same size as the cat and he doesn't want to hurt the cat.

376
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:11,676
Rym: So he grabs the bed and starts like shaking it and roll it around like trying to knock the cat out of it and the Catches like fuck you.

377
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:16,169
Scott: I am he claws into the Latches on with his cat claw.

378
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:18,653
Rym: It's good stuff.

379
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:23,569
Scott: All right, so, you know we rag on soccer a lot and rightfully so.

380
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:30,950
Scott: football It's a broken sport because of many reasons that we have discussed often, but if it was fixed, right?

381
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:32,750
Scott: It could be a great sport.

382
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,047
Scott: It's basically hockey on big grass with feet if you just fucking fix it, right.

383
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:43,409
Scott: so Soccer does have good moments and it could have even more good moments.

384
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:48,468
Scott: But here's an example of one of the great moments of soccer in an awesome video.

385
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:49,590
Scott: Oh my gosh Oh my god.

386
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:55,581
Rym: The only thing that would make this better is if after that that second bit if he just ran over and kicked that guy in The nuts maybe.

387
00:23:55,986 --> 00:24:04,682
Scott: but yeah this is the kind of thing if soccer was always like this and didn't have all of the Diving and penalty kicks and other horseshit.

388
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:06,870
Scott: I would watch it all the goddamn time.

389
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,332
Rym: You know what?

390
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:11,067
Rym: It's like if all of basketball was like the last 30 seconds of basketball.

391
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:18,130
Rym: exactly At a moment the book club book is wool and most of the way through it I finished it a while ago.

392
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:23,009
Rym: Yep All I'm gonna say is I expected it to be X Y & Z and it was.

393
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:27,386
Rym: But it had one one twist that I did not expect.

394
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:28,490
Scott: How far are you along?

395
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,583
Rym: Three-quarters the way through the twist came way before that though.

396
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:45,132
Rym: Yeah, there's a. there's a twist for a guy sees something happen and then goes to react to that in the secret place and what he does to react to it was a. oh This isn't about what I thought it was Like I'd like.

397
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:48,021
Rym: it's about what I thought it was but it's crook slightly.

398
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:49,365
Rym: So yeah direction.

399
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,230
Rym: I literally just did not see coming.

400
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:54,333
Scott: Yeah, I didn't also Didn't think.

401
00:24:55,116 --> 00:24:55,518
Rym: oh, yeah.

402
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:55,960
Rym: Oh, yeah.

403
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,968
Rym: I think I know what your oh is - yeah.

404
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:00,096
Rym: Yeah So I'm enjoying it.

405
00:25:00,277 --> 00:25:01,562
Rym: It's a. it's about it.

406
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:02,345
Rym: It's pretty good book.

407
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:02,847
Rym: It's okay.

408
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:03,710
Rym: You should probably read it.

409
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,213
Rym: It's short.

410
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,158
Rym: You can just blow through it.

411
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,244
Scott: I blew through real fast.

412
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:10,397
Rym: Yeah We did a bunch of panels the anime Boston.

413
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:13,890
Rym: someone uploaded video I'll link to it of one of them just from the audience.

414
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:22,019
Rym: Okay might coordinate with some of the people who videoed it to get the video that other people took and maybe I'll edit it together and Do a ghetto version of what we normally do.

415
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,990
Scott: but video that we took plus their video equals.

416
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:30,610
Rym: But sadly, like I said because of Anna Boston security We did not use any of our high def kit.

417
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:34,845
Rym: So there's gonna be no high quality video of our panel like you're used to.

418
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:39,489
Scott: oh, well, yeah They're mostly panels people have seen before.

419
00:25:40,031 --> 00:25:50,140
Scott: Yeah, you should find us on the internet like our IRC channel or Twitter Facebook Google+ website forum Everywhere that exists on the internet.

420
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,045
Scott: come find us.

421
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:51,487
Scott: We are there.

422
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:54,394
Scott: YouTube twitch Every place.

423
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:54,876
Rym: Yep.

424
00:25:54,896 --> 00:26:03,045
Rym: I'm also gonna take a moment to plug something because if you scroll down through this Kickstarter There's a tiny spot where you'll see my name reference.

425
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:04,816
Rym: Whoa that's.

426
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:08,617
Rym: that's like a Z list celebrity right there.

427
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:10,062
Scott: We're already Z list celebrity.

428
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:10,623
Rym: No, we're like.

429
00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:10,824
Rym: why?

430
00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:11,065
Rym: maybe W?

431
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:15,204
Rym: We're like W at list at this point.

432
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:15,768
Rym: Okay?

433
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:22,503
Rym: But Yeah, the starfighter comic kind of a porny comic.

434
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:25,739
Rym: it's all about a sexual tension and Boys in space.

435
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:34,086
Scott: Yeah If I was a girl, I would be all about it Yep, or the guy who wants to make a comic sexual tension cute girls in space.

436
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:39,568
Rym: I will read that Almost the opposite of space to Andy.

437
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:55,295
Rym: But This Kickstarter is pretty rockin and the kinds of people who listen to Wednesday GeekNights Probably might be interested in this for reasons that will become apparent if you read the Kickstarter if you're the kind of person who watches Boy swimming shows.

438
00:26:55,776 --> 00:27:04,296
Rym: Yeah, if you watch free this or if you like Tokimeki boys side or girl side girl side then Yeah, this is up your alley.

439
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:04,919
Rym: Mm-hmm.

440
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:09,986
Rym: So yeah, we watch this anime Yami shibi yami shibai.

441
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:17,290
Rym: Basically, this is the kind of anime that we would recommend like on our bite-sized anime panel.

442
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,285
Rym: It's one of those short shows not that many episodes.

443
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:23,118
Rym: The episodes are Under four minutes long.

444
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,510
Scott: at least the opener is just ridiculously short.

445
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:32,034
Scott: So it's not a case where the opener and closer are longer than the episode, but the episode is Ridiculously short.

446
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:35,027
Rym: Yep, and the closer is just this sort of forgettable vocaloid songs.

447
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:35,610
Rym: You just skip it.

448
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:36,233
Scott: It's weird.

449
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:37,620
Scott: these vocal I like.

450
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,390
Scott: I noticed I'm like, oh it's weird.

451
00:27:40,213 --> 00:27:44,108
Rym: I would never say that anything about this show is weird except for the show itself.

452
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:46,549
Rym: Yeah Also, I love the crap out of the show.

453
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:47,853
Scott: It's okay.

454
00:27:47,974 --> 00:27:58,003
Rym: Well, so the best way I can describe it is that if you liked folk tales from Japan But you wanted stories where everybody's fucked set in the modern era.

455
00:27:58,604 --> 00:27:59,627
Rym: That's what this show is.

456
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:00,650
Scott: It's pretty much what it is.

457
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:03,230
Scott: Art styles is really interesting.

458
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:15,345
Rym: The art style is based on the this old style of storytelling in Japan where you'd have a stage or like a little tiny stage and you'd have paintings of scenes and you'd pull the cards up or pull the scrolls up and

459
00:28:15,385 --> 00:28:18,901
Scott: that's the guy you see at the beginning is a Guy who does that or you have to do that back in the day.

460
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:20,650
Rym: that dude is sufficiently creepy.

461
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,980
Scott: It's like in the US or wherever they had puppet shows.

462
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,569
Scott: Well, that's what I had in Japan instead of you know, they had that Yep.

463
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:31,270
Rym: So basically this guy appears at a child's or children's playground every day at five.

464
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:35,643
Scott: He tells them a creepy-ass story and that's the episode is the creepy-ass story.

465
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,669
Rym: and these stories are all sort of.

466
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:43,730
Rym: They're either based in Japanese myth or based in Japanese urban legends.

467
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:48,490
Scott: So a lot of them might be more relevant if we knew the urban legends are myths.

468
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,830
Scott: But because we don't like I feel like I'm missing a little bit, but I'm not missing much.

469
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,790
Scott: It's pretty straightforward.

470
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:56,430
Rym: You've seen a lot of anime or know anything about Japan.

471
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:57,313
Rym: You'll cut.

472
00:28:57,353 --> 00:29:02,250
Rym: you'll vaguely recall that a lot of these seem like they're based on something you've heard of before like the Umbrella goddess.

473
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:06,121
Rym: Yeah, who makes possibly the second creepiest sound I've ever heard?

474
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,565
Rym: anything make ever.

475
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:09,210
Scott: I guess rims watched all the episodes.

476
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:14,278
Scott: It didn't take long, but I only watched like half of them and I'm gonna say this still enough It's hard to faze me.

477
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,143
Scott: I'll watch the rest later.

478
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:16,089
Rym: It's hard to scare me.

479
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:27,269
Rym: This show does an amazing job of bringing back that feel when you're a kid And someone's telling you a scary story like a legit scary story for your age.

480
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:36,428
Rym: This show presents that sense of menace and foreboding Better than most things that call themselves horror ever have.

481
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,926
Rym: yeah Didn't watch all of them.

482
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:42,117
Rym: watch Tomonari-kun.

483
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:45,497
Scott: it's very hard to get scared anything But it is what this does.

484
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:51,350
Scott: is you ever be in a situation where like, you know I guess if you have an imagination whatsoever, right?

485
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:59,465
Scott: It's like maybe you'll be in your kitchen downstairs at dark at night and you'll imagine something and it's like you want to actually be Scared but it's like you.

486
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:04,190
Scott: just you know You imagine some creepy shit and of course like maybe a monster in the fridge or some shit, right?

487
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:05,718
Scott: And then you go up in the fridge.

488
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,490
Scott: It's like yeah, it's just the fridge dude, right?

489
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,825
Scott: Well, a lot of these episodes just like what if that thing you imagine?

490
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:13,030
Scott: Nope, it's there every time.

491
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,268
Scott: It's there like you're on whatever that thing you imagine.

492
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:19,770
Rym: Yep It's there like you're on an elevator and it's going down and it stops at a department store.

493
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:20,333
Rym: It stops.

494
00:30:20,373 --> 00:30:34,369
Rym: It's just like an empty weird floor and you're like And everyone else on the elevator gets off on this weird empty floor And then the door closes and it just keeps going down and while you're thinking what the fuck what the fuck?

495
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,139
Rym: The doors just fucking open on hell.

496
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:37,730
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

497
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:39,646
Scott: whatever scary shit you can bet it's.

498
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:47,772
Scott: and Sometimes I guess some of the episodes are like someone did something wrong and it's not necessarily bad just wrong Just wrong.

499
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:55,393
Rym: like like in Tomonari-kun the girl basically her mistake was saying I promise as Opposed to no.

500
00:30:55,714 --> 00:30:57,719
Rym: Yeah, like I'll come back and play with you later.

501
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,750
Rym: I promise the moral is never promise anything creepy anything.

502
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:04,430
Rym: Yep, if something's creepy do not promise it shit.

503
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:16,610
Scott: and then you know, someone does something wrong and then they get haunted or whatever right, but some of them are just like Someone is there and there's a creepy thing and it's like is there really a creepy thing?

504
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:20,536
Scott: Yes, the end Like like I'm late at work.

505
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:22,121
Scott: Let me go use the copy machine.

506
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:23,686
Scott: Oh copy machine.

507
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:25,010
Scott: Something's freaky is happening with it.

508
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,116
Scott: What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

509
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,202
Scott: We should quote Dave Riley.

510
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:27,906
Scott: Oh, it's haunted.

511
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:28,670
Rym: Ah the end.

512
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:35,870
Rym: Yeah, but to go Dave Riley the moral of that one is if creepy shit happens in your copy machine late at night all alone Push that shit out the window.

513
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:37,315
Scott: I know I mean I never.

514
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:41,310
Scott: I can't understand in some of these episodes like why the person does what they do.

515
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:50,685
Rym: I can understand it perfectly because like here's why let's say you are In a situation like that where you're at work late at night, which I can't imagine.

516
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:52,250
Rym: So already that's a weird situation.

517
00:31:52,451 --> 00:32:00,037
Rym: Yeah, let's say you're there for whatever reason like you go to make a copy and weird crap happens The wall part of your brain.

518
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:00,821
Scott: anime character.

519
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:05,950
Scott: Yeah, if I'm an anime character I'm acting completely differently than if I'm in the real world.

520
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:11,530
Scott: These people are acting the way they should in the real world Which is not how you would act if you're an intelligent anime character exactly.

521
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,928
Rym: But in the real world when something creepy happens and you're an adult or you're intelligent you don't immediately go.

522
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:18,774
Rym: Oh my god There's a demon in this copier.

523
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:27,841
Rym: You think that's weird and you're scared a little bit maybe but you don't act like you're scared Like you think what if something's creepy, but you don't think.

524
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:30,030
Scott: is this copier full of fucking hair?

525
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,743
Scott: There's probably like a giant hairball or dead cat in it or something.

526
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:34,110
Rym: Yep, and then you blink and it's gone.

527
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:35,515
Rym: I must have imagined it.

528
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:39,850
Rym: all these stories are when I must have imagined it is not what happened.

529
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,393
Scott: But I know.

530
00:32:40,413 --> 00:32:47,929
Scott: but see being a viewer I know that I'm watching a scary show so you're not just blue I'm not can't disbelieve the Right the actions of the person.

531
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:59,032
Rym: Anyway, yep but the actions of the person like some of them are kind of funny and they remind me of like scary stories to tell in the Dark like zon by episode 2.

532
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:05,650
Rym: Yeah, basically the dude just sees a bunch of people giving him the bonsai cheer and he's remembering it as he's leaving somewhere.

533
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:07,729
Rym: He's like actually come to think of it.

534
00:33:08,512 --> 00:33:15,350
Rym: It's almost like they were doing it backwards Like they were doing it down instead of up and then the cabbie's like what the fuck get the fuck out of my cab.

535
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,176
Rym: Oh my god, you're gonna die real soon.

536
00:33:17,276 --> 00:33:19,323
Rym: at and the episode zon by so like.

537
00:33:19,704 --> 00:33:24,924
Rym: if you give the bonsai chair, that's good But if someone gives you the bot the zon by chair, you're gonna die.

538
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,370
Scott: Why did they give that guy that chair?

539
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,897
Rym: Oh cuz they're assholes.

540
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,010
Scott: Yeah, it's just like he was a guy who got hurt in the woods.

541
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,665
Scott: He went to a hospital and then some old guys at the hospital conspired to curse him for no reason.

542
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:35,849
Scott: Yeah, there's jerks.

543
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,785
Rym: Well, isn't that the moral of a lot of Japanese myth?

544
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:40,850
Rym: you're fucked?

545
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:43,527
Scott: Well, no, it's usually I mean if you watch it.

546
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:47,143
Rym: Oh, yeah, unless you follow the arbitrary rules that you didn't know right?

547
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:55,110
Scott: but then the nice folk tales It's like the evil jerk-off neighbor is the one who gets fucked and then in you the nice person gets rewarded, right?

548
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,981
Scott: But meanwhile here, it's just you're just a normal person.

549
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:58,383
Scott: You're fucked.

550
00:33:59,005 --> 00:33:59,206
Rym: Yep.

551
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:11,170
Rym: Well shit get you You're fucked unless you take the world as you see it and as is presented to you Seriously, so when something actually creepy happens you treat it as creepy.

552
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:16,125
Rym: And if some crazy old lady tells you to follow some rules you follow all of those rules.

553
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:22,719
Scott: and if you don't yeah, I mean there was the episode with the With the family that has to laugh to keep the demon away.

554
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,230
Scott: Yeah, and then they stop laughing and then the demon comes.

555
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:33,989
Rym: They should have told the kid what they were doing and had him laugh with them like right Or the one where they locked the kid in the shed to hide from the Umbrella goddess.

556
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,289
Rym: I didn't like you could have explained to him why you were doing this.

557
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:40,829
Rym: You could have told his friend not to come and fuck it all up.

558
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,081
Rym: Yeah, but you know, these are all gonna be bad endings.

559
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:48,396
Rym: you just like, you know, anytime someone tells you a ghost story It's gonna be a bad ending.

560
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:53,310
Rym: the spoiler of knowing that they're all bad endings almost makes the tension.

561
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,390
Rym: Well, no, it does make the tension way higher than if you didn't know that.

562
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:01,585
Scott: I mean the thing is a lot of them don't even really show the bad ending.

563
00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:04,775
Scott: It's basically just Yep, there's a monster at the end.

564
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:05,196
Rym: Yep.

565
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:18,469
Rym: One of the I think the creepiest one is actually episode 11 or episode 12 video Which is the classic urban legend of kid took a video of a graveyard, but when you watch the video, there's something in the video.

566
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:25,565
Rym: And Yes, I was listen to Dave and Joel and they thought the same thing I did about that episode.

567
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:26,429
Rym: they're like, all right.

568
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:36,490
Rym: So your fucking friend comes over and says hey instead of studying Let's watch this creepy video that kills people and the video is like a VHS wrapped in tape to prevent you from watching it.

569
00:35:37,473 --> 00:35:41,848
Rym: I think Joel was the one who was like, yeah If someone starts unwrapping that video take it from him and just break it.

570
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:48,810
Scott: There was I think I watched Something that was like how it was might have been one of those how movies should have ended or something like that, right?

571
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,115
Scott: Yeah, and someone well, I think it was scream and it was like hey You want to watch that video.

572
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:57,829
Scott: that like you die after you watch it and the guy says sure and he takes the tape He just smashes in a million pieces.

573
00:35:58,952 --> 00:35:59,937
Rym: Who would want to watch that?

574
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:00,299
Rym: Why?

575
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,230
Rym: why did you even take that video done?

576
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:13,242
Rym: But episode 12 Tomanari kun is so close in aesthetic to the scary stories to tell in the dark and Especially because of what Tomanari kun is and looks like.

577
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:31,350
Rym: it's pretty legitimately creepy Because it because that one is the kind of thing that you can almost envision like happening to you like you could see Experiencing something like that and acting exactly the way the girl acts because that's the rational thing to do is act away the girl acts.

578
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:35,346
Rym: But when that fucking shadow appeared in her house, that was actually pretty creepy.

579
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:44,054
Rym: Hmm I really like this show is put out by TV Tokyo by a bunch of people who seem to be pretty not Noteworthy in the anime world.

580
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:47,883
Scott: I mean, I'll probably watch it just because it's so short.

581
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:48,645
Scott: It's not.

582
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:49,688
Rym: why not watch 13 episodes?

583
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:52,296
Rym: They're four minutes long.

584
00:36:52,537 --> 00:36:54,143
Scott: that that includes the opener and the closer.

585
00:36:54,183 --> 00:36:56,150
Rym: that for me who's the opener and not the closer?

586
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,350
Rym: Okay It's four minutes and 30 seconds.

587
00:36:58,691 --> 00:37:05,330
Rym: If you want to do the old RIT anime tradition of watch every opener and closer no matter what sure It won't take you long to watch this thing.

588
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:13,043
Scott: So it doesn't have to be that amazing to be worried like you could watch Like five of these in the time it takes like watch one real anime episode.

589
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:18,001
Scott: so you could watch this whole show in the time it takes to watch two and a half episodes of another show.

590
00:37:18,021 --> 00:37:19,408
Rym: what I would recommend is one.

591
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:22,654
Rym: if you're an anime fan watch it because It's different.

592
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,030
Rym: It's different from a lot of what you watch normally.

593
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:27,550
Rym: It's one of those shows on crunchyroll that almost no one's gonna watch.

594
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:34,190
Scott: But for some reason crunchyroll keeps getting shows like this which makes the crunchyroll subscription kind of worth it.

595
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:43,652
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you have it's like I wouldn't get a crunchyroll subscription to watch this right and it's like I only pay for country roll because there's like three or four shows I'm watching.

596
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:48,430
Scott: right but and if that number goes down, I'll cancel and just use the free crunchyroll again.

597
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,629
Scott: But it's like if you're paying for it.

598
00:37:52,171 --> 00:37:54,258
Scott: You know because of other shows like Kill La Kill.

599
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:58,049
Scott: you might as well watch these shows on there.

600
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:01,870
Rym: Yep, but what I would do if I were you is watch it because it's great.

601
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:14,170
Rym: But if you have non anime friends and you have a Halloween party Like a spooky Halloween party you bust this shit out at night with all the lights off and make people watch a few of them.

602
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,350
Rym: I guarantee you'll have some friends who will be legit scared by this babies.

603
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:28,567
Scott: Yeah, as in a lot of people you'd be surprised how many people like it's like you think like when you're a kid Scary movies are scary for no logical reason.

604
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:30,835
Scott: when you're an adult It's just like what when you're a kid.

605
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:37,885
Rym: non scary movies are sometimes really scary for no logical reason like Beetlejuice is a comedy But a lot of kids that is some scary ass shit.

606
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:38,710
Scott: Yeah, right.

607
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:42,489
Scott: So, I mean their kids are even scared of shit like Sesame Street the movie.

608
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,177
Rym: I'll put it this way this show.

609
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:51,426
Rym: but like I said, I'm not scared by media But this show ratchets up the tension in a way that is palpable.

610
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:53,974
Rym: It's a very well Presented horror.

611
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:56,984
Rym: It's like a good storyteller telling you a good horror story.

612
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:57,426
Scott: It's good.

613
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:58,650
Scott: It's not actually scary.

614
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:02,170
Rym: Anyway, that's not what I said, but I'm very surprised.

615
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:04,503
Scott: I'm very surprised cuz you're a sissy on this.

616
00:39:04,523 --> 00:39:05,710
Scott: I'm surprised on the internet.

617
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:08,059
Rym: I didn't say I was scared by it.

618
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,569
Scott: how many people interpret how many people I mean?

619
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:16,292
Scott: And I see are actually sissies like you think like every adult could just watch scary movies Whatever.

620
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:21,497
Scott: It's actually an I go and I see a lot of people and they're like, yeah I just can't watch any horror movies ever.

621
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:24,570
Scott: It's like they're actually just scared and it's like whoa, really?

622
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:28,903
Scott: There's like a good percentage of adults who are scared for reals.

623
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:30,609
Scott: It's like wow, really?

633
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:37,020
Rym: so yeah, we're back from anime Boston and we We used to review give a full episode to every con we went to but those back when we did four shows a week.

634
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:50,260
Rym: So if you think we're hurting for topics now back then yeah, but it's very rare that one packs is significantly different enough from another packs to warrant a whole show.

635
00:40:57,074 --> 00:41:03,479
Rym: Yep, so the only thing I want to say this is kind of my news is what was different because there were some things that Were different at this anime Boston.

Rym: Yep No, oh your microphone wasn't plugged in.

637
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:11,960
Rym: I'm stupid.
