1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,348
Rym: It's Monday, August 15th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:10,609
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:13,217
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,839
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, the humble home theater PC.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,218
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,390
Rym: I've entered a dangerous part of my life.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,550
Rym: Kind of like when I was young and I realized one day- Nah, not the most dangerous.

8
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:34,349
Rym: I don't think anything I've ever done in my life qualifies to be the MD.

9
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:37,150
Rym: I mean, what could come close?

10
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:41,170
Rym: Maybe that one OhioCon we were edging into MD territory.

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,386
Scott: When you stole your car back from being repo'd.

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,415
Rym: Now, stealing my car back from the guy what stole it from me, even though he kind of legitimately stole it- Legitimately stole it.

13
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:50,829
Scott: You unlegitimately stole it.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,130
Rym: Yeah, but I stole it back and I actually stole it back- You could have gone to jail for GTA.

15
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:57,570
Rym: Actually, I stole it back semi-legitimately.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,587
Rym: The deal was I had already paid what I owed to where the bank was like, "All right, you can have your car

17
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:03,848
Rym: back.".

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:10,890
Rym: But the impound lot wanted to charge me some thousands of dollars to get the car back.

19
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:12,329
Scott: That's how an impound lot works.

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,005
Rym: But they didn't give me any sort of invoice or anything.

21
00:01:15,046 --> 00:01:15,670
Rym: It was just a guy.

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,810
Rym: So I kind of just fast-talked him into like moving the cars that were blocking my car in out of the way because he had one of the keys.

23
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:26,089
Rym: And then he went to get some paperwork and I just drove away because I had the other key.

24
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:30,589
Rym: I was very proud of myself that day, but that was D, not MD.

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,690
Scott: So that guy still has a key to your car that you don't have anymore?

26
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,829
Rym: Yeah, I guess he does.

27
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:43,190
Rym: So, much like when I realized one day that I could buy, you know, pretty much any sword I ever wanted.

28
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,447
Rym: Like if I want a sword right now, I could just buy it.

29
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,990
Rym: But yet, I'm smart enough to not buy swords.

30
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,128
Scott: We've discussed this many times.

31
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:58,050
Rym: So, one thing that came just a little while ago from Fresh Direct, which is why we started the show a little late, is fresh graham crackers.

32
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:01,509
Rym: The other thing that came, vanilla bean ice cream.

33
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,070
Rym: Combining those two is a fresh graham cracker vanilla bean ice cream sandwich.

34
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,350
Rym: And it's really hard to not eat all of them to the exclusion of all other food.

35
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,410
Scott: You would barkel after like three.

36
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:14,769
Rym: Ah, I could eat three.

37
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:15,929
Scott: Oh, really?

38
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,109
Rym: I could easily eat three.

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,676
Scott: You want to?

40
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:18,187
Scott: Let's say it.

41
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,260
Rym: You want to?

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,049
Rym: How much you gonna bet me?

43
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:22,829
Scott: You got to eat three and you got to feel good after.

44
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:24,610
Rym: I would feel great after eating three.

45
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,350
Rym: Now, seven, I think I might not be able to eat because that is approaching the gallon challenge.

46
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:32,244
Scott: I could eat two and then I'd be like, "Uh...".

47
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:33,372
Rym: Really?

48
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:33,856
Rym: Only two?

49
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,670
Rym: You couldn't force the third one down?

50
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,190
Scott: I don't know if I'd barkel or not.

51
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,268
Scott: It's possible.

52
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:41,829
Scott: Or I'd feel real bad if I didn't barkel.

53
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,750
Rym: But at least, you know, I'm an adult.

54
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:48,990
Rym: So, I ate one just now instead of dinner.

55
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,970
Rym: I'll eat dinner later.

56
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,229
Rym: But I had my ice cream first.

57
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,668
Scott: It's not instead of dinner, is it?

58
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,070
Scott: It's just before dinner.

59
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:55,325
Rym: I did once eat...

60
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,250
Scott: For it to be instead of dinner, you would have to not eat dinner.

61
00:02:58,597 --> 00:02:58,682
Scott: Or...

62
00:02:58,932 --> 00:02:59,810
Rym: I could have second dinner.

63
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,186
Scott: You could, I guess, semantically, right?

64
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:03,470
Rym: Have supper.

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,370
Scott: You could eat dinner and say that the dinner was instead of dessert.

66
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,230
Scott: By reversing the order, you could say that each one was instead of the other.

67
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,390
Rym: For my dinner, ice cream.

68
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:13,929
Rym: And for dessert, steak.

69
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,630
Scott: Yes, that's possible.

70
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,430
Rym: You're forgetting, though.

71
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,490
Rym: There's dinner and there's supper.

72
00:03:18,691 --> 00:03:19,247
Scott: They're the same...

73
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:19,730
Rym: No, they're not.

74
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,130
Rym: Yeah, they are.

75
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:20,610
Rym: Not the same.

76
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,026
Rym: Yeah, they are.

77
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:21,650
Rym: Not the same.

78
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,983
Rym: Yeah, they are.

79
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:23,330
Rym: They're not the same thing.

80
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,849
Rym: You're saying that brunch is the same as lunch?

81
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:25,568
Scott: No.

82
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:28,150
Scott: Dinner and supper are the same thing.

83
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:28,608
Rym: No, they're not.

84
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:29,450
Scott: Two words are the same thing.

85
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:30,230
Rym: Not the same thing.

86
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,349
Scott: There aren't two different meals.

87
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,710
Rym: There are, in fact, two different meals.

88
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,248
Rym: You just choose not to eat one of them.

89
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:34,763
Scott: Uh-huh.

90
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:38,170
Rym: Anyway... You look up on Wikipedia, you'll see.

91
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,650
Rym: So, there's a bunch of other tech news, but something kind of blindsided the tech world that I feel like we have to talk about.

92
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,990
Scott: Yep, pretty much the biggest news in a while.

93
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:56,950
Scott: Google buys Motorola Mobility, not all of Motorola, just Motorola Mobility, which is the cell phone part, for a bajillion bajillion dollars.

94
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:57,624
Scott: Many billions.

95
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,749
Rym: Motorola stock went way up.

96
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:02,890
Rym: Google stock dropped a couple percent.

97
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,910
Scott: Well, that's because, you know, so here's the rundown, right?

98
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,044
Scott: Number one, Google paid per share a 63% markup.

99
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,505
Scott: Meaning, if you had a share of Motorola stock, you just made 63% monies.

100
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:18,067
Scott: So, if you had a dollar's worth of stock...

101
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,369
Rym: I really wish I'd known this deal was coming, say, a couple days ago.

102
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,469
Scott: Insider trading.

103
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:24,388
Rym: Yes, it would have.

104
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,129
Scott: Yeah, that's how it works.

105
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:31,130
Scott: But you could have even bought it today, you know, early today, after the news came out.

106
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,548
Scott: If you were quick enough, you probably would have made monies.

107
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:40,110
Scott: Number two, a lot of news articles out there are saying, "Oh, Google's doing it for the patents.

108
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,870
Scott: Google's doing it for the patents," right?

109
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,730
Scott: And I think part of it is Google's doing it for the patents.

110
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,970
Rym: Yeah, but that wouldn't be the only thing.

111
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:48,329
Scott: There's a giant patent war going on right now.

112
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,150
Rym: If they just wanted the patents, they could just license the patents.

113
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:58,150
Scott: Yeah, they could have made a patent deal with Motorola, you know, and given them a lot less than these bajillions of dollars and had the same benefit.

114
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,070
Rym: Yeah, you don't buy a company just for the patents unless they're going all the way down.

115
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,264
Scott: I think clearly...

116
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,710
Rym: Of course, you don't pay a premium for the patents.

117
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:06,097
Scott: No.

118
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,349
Scott: And if you look, right, you know, at the Android... Because obviously it's an Android Play, you know, it's cell phones.

119
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:11,925
Scott: I mean, come on.

120
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,730
Scott: You know, Google is making the Nexus phones with Samsung, but Samsung's kind of weird, right?

121
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:30,790
Scott: Because Samsung is pretty much... They are, I think now, the number one biggest phone maker in the world, and also a significant percentage of like the stuff in an iPhone is Samsung, and Samsung makes like... They make all the screens and they make all the flash memory.

122
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:32,570
Scott: They're really killing it, Samsung.

123
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:39,623
Scott: So even though Samsung made the best Google phone, the Nexus line, you know, it's like, "Well, Google can't buy Samsung.

124
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:39,985
Scott: They're too

125
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:40,227
Scott: big."

126
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:45,029
Scott: And, you know, it's sort of like, "Well, Samsung's got all this other stuff going

127
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,130
Scott: on.".

128
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,010
Scott: Motorola, I don't know if you people know the story, but Motorola used to be the king of cell phones, right?

129
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,870
Scott: They had the StarTAC and the... First of all, they made the first cell phone ever.

130
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:55,270
Scott: They made the StarTAC.

131
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,570
Scott: They made the Razer, right?

132
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:00,309
Scott: The guy who designed the Razer, look him up.

133
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,789
Scott: They literally... This isn't even a joke.

134
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,570
Scott: Motorola literally worked him to death, literally.

135
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:16,409
Scott: Like, he was this great industrial designer, and they pretty much... The company rode his ass so hard, they got mega rich off Razors and stuff, and then he died because they worked him too hard.

136
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:23,369
Scott: But they're making a slight comeback, you know, with the Droid and the Droid 2 and other Droids, right?

137
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:27,510
Scott: And while those aren't quite as good as, say, Nexus, right?

138
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:38,530
Scott: They are pretty much the most popular Android phones, but one of the problems with them really is, unlike the Nexus, they're all infected with all sorts of other bullshit Android, non-Android crap, pretty much, right?

139
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:48,830
Scott: So... And Motorola was really committed to Android, unlike, say, HTC, which sort of makes phones for every OS, and Nokia, which has now gone all in on Windows.

140
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:51,849
Rym: I'm less and less impressed with HTC as time goes on, too.

141
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,466
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

142
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,068
Rym: I used to really kind of...

143
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,190
Scott: HTC was great, say, three, four years ago.

144
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,149
Scott: Now, not so much.

145
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,770
Rym: Yeah, I mean, right now, my Samsung Nexus S is pretty much the best Android phone.

146
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:13,270
Scott: Yeah, but I think what Google gains here, right, in addition to the patents, right, is by owning this Motorola, they can make the droids suck a lot less.

147
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,530
Rym: Yeah, I mean, look at Apple.

148
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,470
Rym: One of the biggest advantages they have is that they have a unification of hardware and software.

149
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:22,670
Scott: And they don't have a unification of everything from the top to the bottom, right?

150
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,610
Scott: They even sell music.

151
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:24,948
Scott: They got the whole thing.

152
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:29,869
Rym: So Google now, they can basically have, like, they know exactly what the hardware will be.

153
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,769
Rym: They could take Motorola's stuff and make just the Google phone.

154
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:41,449
Scott: Yeah, you can definitely predict within a year or so, right, the deal's going to take probably the rest of the year to go through.

155
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:47,630
Scott: If it goes through, even if it doesn't, you'll probably see, like, Samsung Nexus fade on Android.

156
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:56,349
Scott: You'll probably see a lot of people, other companies, maybe fade on Android because, you know, they're like, "How can we sell against the Motorola official Google," right?

157
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:58,489
Scott: It'd be very hard to compete with that.

158
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,530
Rym: I think Google's got a plan there to keep the other vendors in because they want Android to be the commodity OS.

159
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,129
Scott: True, it's true.

160
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:09,330
Scott: You know, people probably still will make Android phones.

161
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,230
Scott: What they could do-- But it will be very difficult to compete, right?

162
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,330
Scott: Imagine if Apple let other people make iOS phones, right?

163
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:24,090
Scott: How many people would buy the, say, Samsung iOS phone versus the Apple iPhone, even if it was possible?

164
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,870
Rym: Those who don't know better and have no idea what all these companies do.

165
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:27,850
Rym: They just want a smartphone.

166
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:29,530
Rym: That's one class.

167
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,149
Rym: That's a big class of people.

168
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:35,770
Rym: You realize how few people care about Google, Android, anything.

169
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,090
Rym: They want a smartphone.

170
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,289
Scott: No, but they'll go into a store that asks for the iPhone.

171
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,042
Scott: They don't ask for-- They don't want some other phone.

172
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:41,690
Scott: that's not the iPhone.

173
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:44,241
Rym: No, no, so they either say-- They go and say, "I want the

174
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:44,650
Rym: Droid.".

175
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,570
Rym: They either say, "I want an iPhone," or they say, "Maybe I want a Droid,".

176
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:51,074
Rym: but they don't know what Droid means other than it's the thing.

177
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:53,410
Rym: that isn't the iPhone that does the same thing.

178
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,489
Rym: Maybe some people want the Pre or the Pixi.

179
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:07,470
Scott: Whatever, the point is, as soon as, you know, the Motorola real Google phone comes out in a year or year and a half, right, it's probably going to be the kickingest Android phone.

180
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,450
Scott: that'll just own everything.

181
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,046
Rym: We'll see.

182
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,270
Rym: Google has really had a long history of getting 80% there on everything.

183
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:22,370
Scott: That's true, but iPhone's not looking so good now, so I got to bail to something, and why wouldn't I bail to the official 100% Google phone if that's an option?

184
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,730
Rym: Oh, so what's bugging you about your iPhone?

185
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,909
Scott: No, it's not so much the iPhone now.

186
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,530
Scott: It's the future of iPhone that is not looking too good.

187
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,490
Rym: You know, the Pre was kind of a mistake on my part.

188
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:39,689
Scott: It still has a better interface than any other smartphone, You know, the Pre would have been fine if they just didn't give up on it.

189
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,930
Rym: I know, they gave up way too quick.

190
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,130
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing actually wrong with it software-wise.

191
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,490
Scott: Hardware-wise, it's some problems, but that was only in the durability department, not in the rest of the department.

192
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,830
Rym: I mean, it wasn't the fastest phone, but the battery lasted for fuck ever.

193
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,070
Rym: It's just that there weren't any apps.

194
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,770
Scott: And it's still the only thing that got the unification of messaging correct.

195
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:58,327
Rym: I know.

196
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,210
Rym: Android, still, it really bothers me.

197
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,030
Scott: Why is there mail and then Gmail separate apps?

198
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,527
Scott: What the fuck?

199
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,430
Rym: Yeah, why is chat and SMS different?

200
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,229
Rym: What the fuck?

201
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:08,748
Rym: Why can't it just be one chain?

202
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,070
Scott: The Pre did it right, and that's years old already.

203
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,548
Rym: I know, and what happened to them?

204
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,608
Rym: Features don't sell.

205
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:18,509
Rym: Well, it's more than that.

206
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,090
Rym: It's that they didn't market it well.

207
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,289
Rym: There wasn't enough hardware for it.

208
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,129
Rym: There wasn't enough buy-in.

209
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:29,930
Rym: There were no apps, which wouldn't have mattered early on, but apps became such a massive commodity to the average user.

210
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:33,210
Scott: It was so much easier to make apps to the Pre than for anything else.

211
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:33,710
Rym: It was.

212
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,950
Scott: You just made them an HTML and JS and whatever.

213
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,850
Scott: I guess the major problem they had there was they didn't get the development tools out fast enough, right?

214
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,787
Scott: The thing is, I didn't need apps.

215
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,310
Rym: I still don't need apps.

216
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,470
Rym: I don't care about apps.

217
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,370
Rym: The only things that are "apps" that I care about are some very fundamental things, like the new Google Maps with the vector-based.

218
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:53,250
Rym: I really need that.

219
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,230
Rym: I like the fact that I can look at Google Maps in the subway.

220
00:10:55,572 --> 00:11:03,490
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is, basically what an app is, really, is the phone doesn't already come with this essential feature, so they make you pay extra for it.

221
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:03,685
Rym: Yep.

222
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,610
Scott: And maybe it's actually beneficial for somebody, because they don't need that extra feature.

223
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,470
Scott: They don't have to pay for it.

224
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,870
Rym: But the only things I needed were the official Google things, and I can't really think of much else.

225
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:15,007
Scott: Some fun games.

226
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:18,150
Rym: Yeah, the only games I own on my phone are...

227
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,650
Scott: Some things that interact with the services that you use that are not Google.

228
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,229
Rym: The Angry Birds.

229
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,770
Rym: That's an alchemy game that I got sick of and deleted.

230
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,149
Scott: Let's see what I got on my phone right now.

231
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,670
Rym: And Eye of Settlers of Catan that I got for review purposes, and I don't really play anymore.

232
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,389
Scott: Here's apps I got on my phone that I actually use.

233
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,209
Scott: Right, so I got a Twitter app, but I won't need that, because the next iPhone will integrate it.

234
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:39,169
Rym: I used the official Twitter app.

235
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,227
Scott: Yeah, so that's an app.

236
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:42,070
Rym: All the Google stuff I have, but duh.

237
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,030
Scott: You know, Beluga.

238
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:44,148
Rym: I have Beluga.

239
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:44,601
Rym: Alright.

240
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,929
Scott: I got Remember the Milk.

241
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:47,069
Rym: I don't use that.

242
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:49,649
Scott: I used that because Google Tasks was not living up.

243
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:53,890
Rym: Yeah, I use Google Tasks a lot more now, but not on my phone.

244
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:54,810
Scott: I used to use Remember the Milk.

245
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,870
Scott: Google Tasks was failing me, so I switched back to it.

246
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,630
Scott: Uh, Spotify.

247
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:58,769
Scott: Got that on there.

248
00:11:59,074 --> 00:11:59,306
Rym: Oh, yeah.

249
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:01,390
Rym: I'm thinking about dropping Spotify, though.

250
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:02,406
Scott: I don't know, I'm...

251
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:03,609
Rym: I paid for it to see.

252
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,850
Rym: It's pretty great, but... I'd say I only have about a 50% hit rate of searching for music.

253
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:10,269
Scott: Eh, I got more than that.

254
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,770
Scott: But it still, it doesn't have any of the weird foreign anything.

255
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,470
Rym: Which is a lot of what I want.

256
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,070
Rym: Yeah, right.

257
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,090
Rym: Because I already have a lot of the other stuff.

258
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:17,488
Rym: I know.

259
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,169
Rym: And you know what's not in there?

260
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:20,990
Rym: All the Meat Loaf stuff I actually want.

261
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,336
Scott: What?

262
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:23,350
Scott: I thought I saw every Meat Loaf album.

263
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,048
Rym: Yeah, not all of it.

264
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,110
Rym: Not all of it?

265
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:25,383
Rym: No.

266
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,046
Rym: What?

267
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,610
Rym: When I searched for Meat Loaf, there's only one album it gives me.

268
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,150
Rym: The rest was all from my own collection.

269
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,710
Scott: Let me search this here.

270
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:33,769
Rym: And a handful of singles is what I saw.

271
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,509
Scott: Let me look.

272
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,270
Rym: Also, you know, no Beatles, no Zeppelin.

273
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,170
Scott: Well, yeah, I mean, it's missing like a few big ones, right?

274
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,187
Scott: Let's see, albums.

275
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,469
Rym: I have searches of Meat Loaf in there.

276
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,630
Scott: Bad out of hell, the very best of Meat Loaf.

277
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,870
Scott: Bad out of hell, bad out of hell 2, bad out of hell 3.

278
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,528
Rym: Are they available to listen?

279
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:51,389
Rym: Or are they just listed?

280
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,970
Scott: Bad out of hell 3.

281
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,630
Rym: Can you listen to them or are they just listed?

282
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,369
Scott: You can listen to them, they're all there.

283
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,090
Rym: Because when I went in before, this is like some weeks ago.

284
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,770
Scott: You know, you seem to have this big fail at searching in general, right?

285
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,390
Rym: No, it listed all the albums, but then I clicked on each album and it had, like, the tracks were all grayed out.

286
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,370
Rym: And if you hover over them, it was like, this isn't available in your region.

287
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,945
Scott: Uh-huh.

288
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,090
Scott: I've seen that happen for some albums, but not for Meat Loaf.

289
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:14,530
Rym: Yep.

290
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,370
Rym: But I don't know, I don't use it enough to be worthwhile.

291
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:21,370
Rym: It also, the caching stuff doesn't work that well.

292
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,650
Scott: Maybe it works for me.

293
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,850
Rym: I have to think way ahead of when, like, Google Listen, for example, just kind of auto-download stuff all the time.

294
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,449
Rym: It just kind of always has stuff in there.

295
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,250
Rym: But Spotify, I gotta, like, make a playlist and designate what I want.

296
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,915
Scott: Well, that's different.

297
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:35,709
Scott: This is RSS, you know, Google Listen is RSS.

298
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,088
Scott: There's a new episode, sure, it could download it, right?

299
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,289
Rym: Ah, yeah.

300
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,269
Scott: But it's just music.

301
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:42,929
Scott: It's like, well, how does it know what the fuck you're gonna listen to?

302
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,270
Rym: Oh, I know, but here's my use case.

303
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:46,130
Rym: This is the fundamental problem.

304
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:52,548
Rym: My use case for music on my phone is primarily, I'm stuck in the subway and I just need something to listen to.

305
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:53,170
Rym: right the fuck now.

306
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,329
Scott: Right, so?

307
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,050
Rym: And I don't go on, really, road trips anymore.

308
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,630
Rym: I don't really need music in any other case.

309
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,650
Rym: And the last time I went on a road trip, I tried to use the Spotify on the road trip.

310
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,128
Rym: You know what?

311
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,850
Rym: It kept fucking up and just, like, not playing or, like, failing or, like, buffer, buffer, buffer.

312
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,830
Rym: It kept losing its signal.

313
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,370
Rym: Even when I had full 4, like, I had full 4G and it just wouldn't work.

314
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:16,550
Rym: It would, like, stop playing songs and it crashed my phone a couple times.

315
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,510
Scott: I only have iPhone 3G and I got no problems.

316
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,430
Scott: Oh, phone crashing?

317
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,450
Scott: Maybe I should stick with iPhone.

318
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:22,210
Scott: I forgot that iPhones don't crash.

319
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,670
Rym: The only thing that has ever crashed my phone is Spotify.

320
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,068
Scott: Oh, maybe I'll stay with my iPhone.

321
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:28,350
Rym: I don't know.

322
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,170
Scott: We'll see how it goes.

323
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,008
Scott: I got time here.

324
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:43,808
Rym: So, anyway, I want to talk about this briefly, but there's a story here about a 20-year-old man in the Britons, Albion, who was arrested for trying to encourage people over Blackberry Messenger to join in a big water fight.

325
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:44,450
Rym: he was planning.

326
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,970
Scott: Nice.

327
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:47,670
Rym: And it links to some other arrests.

328
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,030
Rym: Bitches.

329
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,710
Rym: Some people were arrested for posting inflammatory comments on Facebook.

330
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,030
Scott: How can you be arrested for posting something on Facebook?

331
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,389
Scott: Do they have freedom of speech over there or not?

332
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:56,744
Scott: No, they don't.

333
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,789
Scott: Then why the fuck would anyone live there?

334
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,130
Rym: You realize there is no freedom of speech the way we have it in the US and Britain.

335
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:10,190
Rym: I mean, here, I could right now on GeekNights call all of you to riot illegally, and I could do it pretty seriously.

336
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:19,190
Rym: And you would have to actually, like, really take me seriously and actually, like, make moves to actually riot before they even consider going after me.

337
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,630
Scott: You'd have to make a specific threat that you could pull off and were going to pull off against the person, right?

338
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:24,030
Scott: Yup.

339
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,842
Scott: It's pretty rough.

340
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:34,010
Rym: But, one, I'm interested that they arrested an arbitrary number of people for inciting riots and posting inflammatory comments on Facebook.

341
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,190
Rym: I don't think they've seen the rest of Facebook.

342
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:41,150
Scott: Maybe there's a reason that there's these riots is because you're arresting people for posting shit on Facebook.

343
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:41,726
Scott: No, no.

344
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,902
Scott: If they were arresting people for posting shit on Facebook in the US, you know what?

345
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:47,070
Scott: I might be convinced to riot.

346
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,969
Rym: Scott, the reason there's riots is because it's Chavs.

347
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:57,390
Scott: I know that, too, but the thing is, you know, we lost a bunch of freedom here, but that's crossing a line, I think.

348
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:04,670
Scott: Well, the line that's being crossed, and it really bothers me, is that, one, Britain is seriously- If I go to Britain, even though I'm a US citizen, do I have to deal with that shit?

349
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:05,409
Rym: I guess.

350
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:07,209
Scott: Oh, man, I don't want to go there now.

351
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:14,928
Rym: But, I mean, Britain is seriously, like, they're looking into shutting off IM networks and things when riots and protests happen.

352
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:23,709
Scott: So, San Francisco, the BART trains, turned off the cell phone coverage, and the FCC is going over there and being like, "What the fuck,

353
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,910
Scott: guys?".

354
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,370
Rym: Now, on one hand, they provided that as a service in their own tunnels.

355
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,110
Scott: That's true, but the FCC is still going to check it out.

356
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,517
Rym: Yeah, and I feel like there will be some legislation there, but- I don't think there will be legislation.

357
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,350
Scott: I think there will be an FCC smackdown.

358
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:43,590
Rym: I don't know if the FCC can because of the weird relationship between those providers of cell service, because there was no cell service down there before.

359
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:45,556
Scott: It doesn't matter.

360
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:49,930
Scott: There was no cell service in Manhattan 20 years ago, so we're not allowed to turn it off now.

361
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:57,190
Rym: But, Scott, all that cell service is being provided as cell service by the cell providers, not like repeaters or, like, private connections.

362
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:04,069
Rym: I mean, if I buy a femtocell from, like, Sprint in my house, and I just fucking unplug it one day, am I in trouble?

363
00:17:06,131 --> 00:17:09,690
Scott: Maybe Sprint can get you in trouble, because with Sprint, not with the government.

364
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:13,402
Rym: Yeah, so how come the FCC can- what's the difference between those two situations?

365
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:15,829
Rym: Privately owned, internal use?

366
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,560
Scott: Because I'm pretty sure BART is public.

367
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:18,890
Scott: It's a public transit.

368
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,250
Rym: Yeah, a public place does not necessarily- I mean, what if I invite people over to my house, have a big public party?

369
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,172
Scott: Uh, no.

370
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,823
Scott: As in, BART is a- BART is government.

371
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:28,646
Scott: It's a government train.

372
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:29,128
Scott: I think it is.

373
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:29,690
Scott: I could be wrong.

374
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,070
Rym: Yeah, and how does that exactly affect the situation?

375
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,070
Scott: Because now the government is turning off private cell phone networks.

376
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:45,430
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, they're turning off the private part of the cell phone network they purchased to themselves run for people as an optional, like, extra service.

377
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,976
Scott: It's a municipal cell phone service?

378
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,210
Scott: It's not Sprint or Verizon or something?

379
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:55,710
Rym: You realize the cell services are regulated much in the same way that the telcos were in landlines.

380
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,015
Scott: Buy?

381
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:57,227
Rym: Buy the FCC.

382
00:17:58,073 --> 00:17:58,154
Scott: No!

383
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:58,276
Scott: Okay.

384
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:09,510
Rym: But there is a distinction, Scott, between, for example, a cell tower that's placed by the provider for coverage in a general area versus, like, a repeater or something that is added to an indoor area.

385
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,470
Scott: First of all, I think these trains are outside.

386
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,473
Rym: Not all of them.

387
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:13,377
Rym: They're inside and outside.

388
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,810
Rym: And when they're outside, you get service anyway!

389
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,098
Scott: No, I don't know.

390
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:17,710
Scott: I don't know about that.

391
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,290
Rym: Because you're outside!

392
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,573
Scott: I don't know how this works.

393
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:24,230
Scott: There's not enough details because, you know, freaking news never covers anything in deep technical detail.

394
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:33,010
Rym: From what I read in the articles about this, it said that the only thing they turned off was the repeaters that mattered in the tunnels themselves, even though most of the system was above ground.

395
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:33,708
Scott: Uh-huh.

396
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:35,333
Scott: Why, then?

397
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:39,189
Scott: That's just stupid because it doesn't help you, even if you were trying to crack that.

398
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:52,170
Rym: I think the real issue here is that suddenly there's a bunch of riots, and suddenly the governments of the world are starting to realize that the internet and communication technology allows people to organize things, go to our bed very quickly, and they're panicking.

399
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,997
Scott: Yeah, the thing that bothers me the most is the hypocrisy, right?

400
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:57,543
Scott: It's like, you know, Egypt, Syria, the U.S.

401
00:18:57,563 --> 00:19:00,129
Scott: goes over there and is like, "Oh, you very bad, turning off

402
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:00,550
Scott: internet!".

403
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:02,439
Scott: And then it's like, "Oh, shit, things are happening.

404
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:03,364
Scott: Turn off internet in

405
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:03,866
Scott: U.S.,

406
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:04,630
Scott: Britain!".

407
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,841
Scott: It's like, well, didn't you just tell them not to?

408
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,007
Scott: But it went over here.

409
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:08,470
Scott: It's okay.

410
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,525
Rym: Oh, but Scott, they were clearly very different situations.

411
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,090
Rym: I mean, over--.

412
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,909
Scott: Yes, one had Arab people and one had white people.

413
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:17,641
Rym: Therefore-- Over here, they were rioting.

414
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:18,927
Rym: I mean, what were they doing over there?

415
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:20,358
Rym: They were so ba-- Oh, right, wait.

416
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:21,205
Scott: They were rioting.

417
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:27,769
Rym: In fact, they were rioting for something good, and we were rioting for, I don't know-- Also something good!

418
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,010
Rym: Well, that's debatable.

419
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,950
Scott: Just not as good.

420
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,171
Rym: I don't know.

421
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:37,209
Rym: I feel like Britain especially, they're always on the forefront of panicking about stuff like this.

422
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,670
Rym: And the real question here is, all right, so they got this guy on Blackberry and Facebook, these guys.

423
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:56,910
Rym: That means that either Blackberry and Facebook are colluding with the government directly in semi-real time, or that the government is snooping on this stuff on its own without Blackberry or Facebook's involvement in semi-real time.

424
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:02,809
Scott: There's no way for us to know which one of those is true, but it does mean-- I mean, the guy was messaging about a water fight, right?

425
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,898
Scott: He was like, "Hey, let's go have a water gun fight.

426
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,910
Scott: Super Soakers, water balloons, let's go," right?

427
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:13,830
Scott: That means that someone in the government read that message, whoever they got the message, and actually was like, "We gotta stop this fucking Super--".

428
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,328
Scott: It's like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

429
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:18,407
Scott: You're like, "Oh, we gotta crack down and go arrest the guy who wants to do Super

430
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:18,790
Scott: Soakers.".

431
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:21,121
Scott: What kind of moron is--.

432
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:25,443
Scott: I mean, even the cops in New York would be like, "All right, dude, seriously, water Super Soaker in the park?

433
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:26,368
Scott: You're shooting the old people.

434
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:26,609
Scott: Cut it

435
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:26,750
Scott: out.".

436
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:27,637
Rym: Oh, so you know what?

437
00:20:27,677 --> 00:20:28,826
Rym: Here's why they went after this guy.

438
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,410
Rym: Where is the common sense?

439
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,749
Rym: Scott, here's why they went after this guy.

440
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:37,850
Rym: In 2008, there was a spate of mass water fights in British towns and cities that were organized through social networks.

441
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:39,349
Rym: Most remained peaceful.

442
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:39,572
Rym: So?

443
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:42,230
Rym: So clearly, they have to crack down on that.

444
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,201
Scott: Clearly, we're not allowed to have water fights.

445
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:45,590
Scott: That would be-- oh, god, no.

446
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,230
Rym: In fact, you wanna throw some fuel on the fire?

447
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:56,410
Rym: This month, a water fight attended by thousands of young Iranians attracted the attention of Tehran's morality police and led to a series of arrests.

448
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,126
Rym: So, Britain, way to be just like Iran.

449
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,070
Scott: Yeah, crack down on those peaceful, fun water fights.

450
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,409
Scott: See, now it would be really cool.

451
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,969
Scott: See, if I was the chief of police, you know what I would do?

452
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:07,890
Rym: Join the water fight?

453
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:11,650
Scott: I would show up with the cops like we were gonna bust it up evil.

454
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:13,309
Rym: And then all the cops pull out their water guns?

455
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:13,968
Rym: No.

456
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:16,850
Scott: All the cops are secretly firemen.

457
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,009
Scott: Oh, shit, you're getting wet now!

458
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:20,318
Scott: Yeah, what's that?

459
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:21,065
Scott: Super soaker?

460
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:21,650
Scott: That's a joke.

461
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,648
Rym: Talk about this.

462
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:25,623
Scott: I was gonna make a joke-- Oh, you're drowning?

463
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,150
Rym: Oh, what?

464
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,150
Rym: Scott, I was gonna make a bad joke about how we did that once during the civil rights movement.

465
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,469
Rym: People were really mad about it, so we can't do it again.

466
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:34,393
Rym: Aww.

467
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:36,710
Scott: But I mean, I'd just be having a water fight.

468
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,060
Rym: Yeah.

469
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,970
Rym: So, I don't know, this is a topic kind of for another show.

470
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,507
Rym: I just wanted to call attention to this simmering--.

471
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:50,110
Rym: It's not really a debate, it's just the governments are panicking and starting to realize that-- Like, say we got really mad.

472
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,830
Rym: I mean, in Britain, it's a bunch of chavs and idiots rioting over nothing.

473
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:55,049
Rym: Say a bunch of nerds got mad.

474
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,730
Rym: All right, we're gonna organize via social networks and SMS and everything, and we're gonna use encryption.

475
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:01,509
Scott: Yep.

476
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:03,870
Rym: Of course, BlackBerry's encrypted.

477
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:04,549
Scott: No, it's not.

478
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,090
Rym: Well, it is encrypted, except that BlackBerry can open it up to the government.

479
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,910
Rym: So clearly, BlackBerry is opening it up to the government.

480
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,010
Scott: Now, I mean, technically-- The

481
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:27,706
Rym: implication here is that BlackBerry has opened it up to the government recently as a result of what was happening here, which is interesting because I recall much of the West being up in arms when countries in the more brown parts of the world were demanding that BlackBerry open up to their

482
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:28,029
Scott: governments.

483
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,290
Rym: The point is, right-- It's like the most hypocritical thing that could possibly happen.

484
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:33,250
Rym: You're talking about encryption?

485
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,410
Scott: I mean, technically, I could rot 13-something and send it to you, and that would be encrypted, right?

486
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:44,390
Scott: But it's not really encrypted because anyone could just be like, "A derp, derp, derp," and, you know, crack it.

487
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:49,350
Scott: It only counts as encryption if it's end-to-end, public-private key.

488
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,870
Scott: You can't crack it unless you have a million years in a supercomputer.

489
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:54,490
Rym: I would argue, Scott, that doesn't matter.

490
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:56,208
Rym: It depends on what you're trying to do.

491
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:03,630
Rym: If you need to organize something quickly, it only needs to remain encrypted for however long it takes to organize your event.

492
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,881
Scott: Right, but you could still use end-to-end public-private key.

493
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:08,570
Scott: They would never break it, and it would totally work.

494
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,990
Rym: But that requires a large amount of pre-planning on behalf of everyone.

495
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,183
Rym: All right, so public-private key.

496
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:14,849
Rym: How do--.

497
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,710
Rym: All right, so I want to coordinate with some Joe Schmo out there right now because we're going to have a riot tomorrow.

498
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:21,910
Scott: You have the things set up in advance.

499
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,655
Rym: That's what I said.

500
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:24,649
Rym: It requires coordination and pre-planning.

501
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:30,990
Scott: Here's the problem, right, is that none of the social networking mechanisms, right, have encryption built in.

502
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,756
Scott: You could easily just have--.

503
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:36,690
Scott: imagine if Facebook had a public-key store built into it that was transparent.

504
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,336
Scott: All Facebook could be public-private key.

505
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:39,963
Scott: No one would even have to do anything.

506
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,750
Scott: It would just be perfectly encrypted all the time.

507
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,530
Rym: Yeah, and Facebook and the government don't want that.

508
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:44,708
Scott: Maybe I should make that.

509
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,266
Rym: Yeah, we should add it onto Google+.

510
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:50,888
Scott: I could just plop it on top of SMS or whatever.

511
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:57,210
Rym: Yeah, there'd be still a lot of pre-planning, getting people on board, and people have tried similar things in the past.

512
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,990
Scott: You sign up for an account, it generates a--.

513
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:08,750
Rym: I mean, Scott, to this day, how many people do you know who actually use PGP or GPG to sign and/or encrypt their email and actually use it?

514
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:13,490
Scott: Because here's the thing, is that requires a lot of extra clicks, right, and typing things in.

515
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:15,449
Rym: Come on, we had Fire GPG.

516
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:18,289
Scott: Yeah, it required extra clicks and typing things in.

517
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:25,830
Scott: You could be done in such a way that requires not even knowledge on the user's part that the encryption is taking place.

518
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:27,610
Scott: Yet, it could be fully encrypted.

519
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:36,270
Rym: But that would still require, for example, those people would have to have a key generated for them that is put privately on their side and their public key is put in a repository somewhere.

520
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:36,565
Rym: Yes.

521
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,370
Rym: And there has to be some sort of identity validation so you know whose key you're getting.

522
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:43,530
Rym: That already breaks the chain of trust for most people.

523
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,350
Scott: As long as you trust the centralized public-key repository.

524
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,042
Rym: Yes, I'm going to trust scottrubinsrepo.org.biz.tl.

525
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:52,370
Scott: It's not going to be like that.

526
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,147
Rym: Yeah, it will.

527
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,870
Scott: Plus, if you got the wrong public key, you know what?

528
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:59,130
Scott: Your messages wouldn't decrypt properly.

529
00:24:59,291 --> 00:24:59,850
Scott: They'd be all garbled.

530
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:03,289
Scott: What could possibly-- you're not sending your private key to me.

531
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:12,310
Rym: Well, you realize if I encrypt my message for a public key that's illegitimate, they can decrypt the messages that I directed at them.

532
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:13,933
Scott: That's true.

533
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:17,290
Scott: You could accidentally send your message to the wrong person if you get the wrong public key.

534
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:24,390
Rym: So I would flood your stupid registry with a million names, all slightly crook, slightly so, all going to me.

535
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:26,650
Scott: Sure.

536
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:27,569
Rym: Yeah.

537
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:35,289
Scott: But the thing is, when you add your friend to your buddy list and you start talking to him and he doesn't get the messages, he'll be like, "Hey, you added the wrong guy to your list.

538
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:35,630
Scott: Delete.".

539
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:38,150
Rym: Ah, but it's too late for that when the riot's about to go down.

540
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,386
Scott: Because the first message you sent was, "Hey, let's

541
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:40,769
Scott: riot."

542
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:43,766
Scott: As opposed to, "Hey, what's going

543
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:44,047
Scott: on?".

544
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:48,581
Scott: I imagine-- I mean, people who aren't nerds-- Sign up for a brand new social network.

545
00:25:48,662 --> 00:25:49,327
Scott: First message.

546
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:49,650
Scott: Riot!

547
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:53,490
Rym: People who are nerds don't think about this stuff until it's time to riot.

548
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,755
Scott: I think people will be using--.

549
00:25:55,815 --> 00:26:00,250
Scott: you know, if it's a successful network, people will just be using it over the course of whatever.

550
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,690
Rym: Yeah, and no one's making anything like that.

551
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:03,382
Scott: I could make it.

552
00:26:03,403 --> 00:26:03,650
Scott: It's trivial.

553
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:04,530
Rym: Yeah, yeah, you gotta.

554
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:05,470
Scott: Maybe I will.

555
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:13,190
Scott: That's really-- unlike other things I'm doing that require a lot of time and effort, an encrypted message sending thing is really simple.

556
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,710
Scott: It's like, I actually made one in college.

557
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:17,410
Rym: I remember.

558
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,739
Scott: For like one project in a class.

559
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,370
Scott: I took a day or two with two other guys in Java.

560
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,240
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

561
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,836
Rym: There was that Wheatley puppet that everyone saw on YouTube a while ago.

562
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:37,620
Rym: It was pretty cool.

563
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:42,940
Rym: And here's a nice page of how the girl who made the awesome Wheatley puppet made it.

564
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,279
Rym: And it's actually surprisingly complex.

565
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,620
Scott: Yeah, I noticed that the video of the puppet got around the internet big time.

566
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:56,540
Scott: But the page on her little blog that actually showed all the pictures of the back and all that stuff did not get around the internet nearly as much, which was surprising.

567
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,629
Rym: Because this is the much more interesting part.

568
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,920
Rym: It's surprisingly well done.

569
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:03,220
Scott: And you can learn a thing or two about building stuff.

570
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:03,822
Rym: Yeah.

571
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:09,300
Rym: I mean, she has very detailed pictures of every step, every problem, everything.

572
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,420
Scott: Also, did you know that if Jim Henson went to the University of Baltimore-- oh, no, Maryland.

573
00:27:16,522 --> 00:27:17,190
Scott: It's near Baltimore.

574
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:17,979
Scott: Did you know that?

575
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:18,618
Rym: No.

576
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,500
Scott: Did you know that you could go there and major in puppeteering?

577
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:25,650
Rym: It's like with the printing major.

578
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,680
Rym: Why didn't someone tell me that when I was still in school?

579
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:30,140
Scott: I knew that because I went and I looked at the University of Maryland.

580
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,899
Scott: So how come you're not a puppeteer?

581
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,859
Scott: Because I want computers more than puppets.

582
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,738
Scott: That's why.

583
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:40,817
Scott: I could have gotten the joint computer puppeteer thing and made-- well, that's robots.

584
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:41,440
Scott: Oh, well.

585
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:42,869
Scott: So check this out.

586
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:43,599
Scott: This is real simple.

587
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,360
Scott: I don't know how many people have actually programmed websites, right?

588
00:27:47,560 --> 00:28:00,860
Scott: But if you use something like PHP-- well, actually, if you use PHP, the way it's done in general-- I mean, there are template languages for PHP, but most people, the code of the PHP is mixed in with the HTML.

589
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,498
Scott: That's how it works.

590
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:20,980
Scott: And it makes a big mess, and this is why real programmers-- quote, "real programmers"-- hate PHP, because it makes a big mess, and you could program yourself into a hole, and something that takes a second to do and something that is more well-written and clean in some other language might take hours to do in PHP if the project is already a disaster.

591
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:27,580
Scott: But to do something simple, like a one-page form in PHP, is a lot less work, because you can just slap it together real one, two, three quick.

592
00:28:28,183 --> 00:28:31,640
Scott: But PHP is generally hated among real programmers and programming communities.

593
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:37,798
Scott: So this guy made something that was just a funny joke called Django PHP.

594
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:52,039
Scott: And what this does is you can have a Django app, and in the Django templates, which are separated from the Django code, you could actually put PHP in there, and it sends it to the PHP interpreter where it gets executed, and it comes back.

595
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:55,160
Scott: So you can put PHP in the Django.

596
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,018
Scott: And the best part of this is the FAQ on his page, which is like, "Why would you do

597
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:00,299
Scott: that?".

598
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:02,100
Scott: And the answer is troll face.

599
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:05,278
Scott: It's pretty good.

600
00:29:06,722 --> 00:29:07,800
Scott: It's not something for serious.

601
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,600
Rym: No, but-- I just little.

602
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:10,660
Rym: Anyway.

603
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,419
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book is the ear, the eye, the arm.

604
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,779
Scott: We'll be doing it-- I'm already almost halfway through.

605
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:18,398
Rym: Mine hasn't shipped yet.

606
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:22,460
Rym: Apparently, a lot of listeners ordered it, and it hasn't shipped for them either.

607
00:29:22,683 --> 00:29:23,078
Scott: I got one.

608
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:24,620
Scott: It's what you get for hesitating.

609
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,639
Scott: People don't learn.

610
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,079
Rym: I ordered it before I announced it.

611
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:29,220
Scott: I ordered it after.

612
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,980
Scott: How come I got it already?

613
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:30,376
Scott: I don't know.

614
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:31,459
Rym: I ordered it from Amazon.

615
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:32,980
Rym: It's still like pending shipping.

616
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,319
Scott: Amazon loves me more than you.

617
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:34,939
Rym: I guess.

618
00:29:35,662 --> 00:29:36,598
Scott: Did you order something else with it?

619
00:29:37,323 --> 00:29:37,365
Rym: No.

620
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,600
Scott: I ordered two books.

621
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:39,459
Rym: Actually, no, I did.

622
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:39,999
Scott: Daddy, two books.

623
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:41,379
Rym: I did, and you know what?

624
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:44,620
Rym: All that other stuff, I got the notice where it shipped separately.

625
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:46,319
Scott: I don't know.

626
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:47,019
Scott: I got the book.

627
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:47,577
Rym: I don't know.

628
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:48,519
Rym: It's a short read.

629
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,579
Rym: We will do the book club book after PAX.

630
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,240
Scott: Probably.

631
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,679
Rym: There's no way we'll do it before PAX.

632
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,299
Scott: I'll probably finish it, though, before PAX.

633
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,919
Scott: You won't.

634
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,419
Rym: I won't, unless I get the book.

635
00:29:58,021 --> 00:30:00,459
Rym: Even then, we wouldn't record it before PAX.

636
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,759
Scott: No, not a chance.

637
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,700
Rym: The next book club book is not announced yet.

638
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,620
Rym: We will be at the Penny Arcade Expo, aka PAX, in two weeks.

639
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:09,356
Scott: Yep.

640
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,940
Rym: We're doing a panel on Saturday, Discover the Forgotten Masters.

641
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:19,820
Rym: A little secret for you listeners, so you know what we're doing, because the masses out there won't, talking about some Outlaw.

642
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,580
Scott: I don't think you have to do the whole panel here.

643
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,299
Rym: I'm not doing the whole panel.

644
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,460
Rym: Just saying I'm talking about some Outlaw.

645
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:24,940
Rym: All right.

646
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:25,760
Rym: Maybe some Sopwith.

647
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:27,072
Scott: What else are we doing at PAX?

648
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,144
Rym: From 6 to 8 p.m.

649
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:41,679
Rym: in the workshop tabletop area, we will be doing demos and teaching of Seven Wonders, Carcassonne, Inspectors, and Spotted, and there will be other tabletop workshop stuff going on in those rooms, all con.

650
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,720
Rym: All right.

651
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,900
Scott: Also, you should know, as usual, we are on the internets.

652
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,220
Scott: Internets exist, and we are all over them, internets.

653
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,199
Scott: We're on the Facebooks, the Twitters, our website, our forums.

654
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,216
Scott: We got emails, geeknuts.com.

655
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:01,400
Scott: We got everything, so wherever you are on the internets, you should come and connect with us in the fashion of your choosing.

656
00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:03,680
Scott: iTunes, I don't give a shit.

657
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:04,459
Scott: Do whatever you want.

658
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,560
Rym: So, I very recently built my HTPC, and it's going pretty great.

659
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:12,200
Scott: We did an episode on HTPCs, but it was like a combo episode.

660
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,020
Rym: It was one of those episodes where I look back at it, and I was like, wow, yeah, that was probably a crab people at the last second.

661
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,860
Scott: This is also a crab people at the last second.

662
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:20,400
Rym: I know.

663
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,392
Rym: We came up with this idea almost 24 hours ago.

664
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:24,779
Scott: It was still a crab people.

665
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,671
Rym: It still is.

666
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:36,240
Rym: But also, you know, we haven't, that episode, from what I looked at, we didn't really talk about designing an HTPC or like the uses, pros, cons, all that stuff.

667
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,999
Rym: We pretty much just talked about the HTPC that you would happen to build.

668
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,360
Scott: Well, here's pretty much what it comes down to, right?

669
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:45,240
Scott: I tell this to people all the time, and not enough people listen to me, right?

670
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,020
Scott: You look around the world, and there's so many boxes people connect to their televisions, right?

671
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,940
Scott: They got game consoles.

672
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:52,079
Scott: They got cable boxes.

673
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:53,200
Scott: They got DVD players.

674
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:54,080
Scott: They got Blu-Ray players.

675
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,839
Scott: They got VCRs.

676
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,534
Scott: They got Roku's.

677
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,960
Scott: They got all kinds of ridiculous crap connected to their TVs.

678
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,500
Scott: But the thing is, everybody should, Apple TVs, forget that shit.

679
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:12,640
Scott: Now, everybody should connect a real Windows running desktop computer, you know, to their television, right?

680
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,460
Scott: If you don't care anything about video games, a Mac Mini is okay.

681
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:20,420
Scott: But, if you care about games at all, it has to be a Windows computer.

682
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,199
Scott: The benefits of doing this are ginormous.

683
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,380
Scott: I don't understand how anyone could not do this, right?

684
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,440
Scott: Who cares about, right?

685
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,300
Scott: And then you cancel your fucking cable because you don't need that shit anymore, right?

686
00:32:31,941 --> 00:32:36,539
Scott: Now, you know, you might think, well, I've got, you know, my Netflix on my Xbox, and that's enough for me.

687
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,820
Scott: Well, maybe it is enough for you.

688
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,280
Scott: Maybe all you really do in your life is Netflix and Xbox games.

689
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:51,299
Rym: Ah, but not that long ago, the other night, I was thinking, hey, I should show Emily the Goonies because she's never seen it, and I kind of want to watch it again through adult eyes.

690
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,340
Scott: And it wasn't on Netflix?

691
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,600
Rym: It's not on the Netflix streaming.

692
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,359
Scott: Well, you'd have to get it on a Netflix disc.

693
00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:57,260
Scott: Yeah, but I couldn't have that.

694
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,900
Scott: And your Xbox is a DVD player.

695
00:32:57,981 --> 00:32:59,940
Rym: I could not have that right then.

696
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,060
Rym: I'm sitting in the living room.

697
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,200
Rym: I'm like, hey, the Goonies.

698
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:02,798
Rym: I click.

699
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:04,078
Rym: Not there.

700
00:33:04,562 --> 00:33:10,797
Rym: In the time it would take me to even so much as get up and think about putting something in my queue, I just torrent it.

701
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:11,432
Scott: Yep.

702
00:33:12,722 --> 00:33:15,780
Scott: And you couldn't play a torrent on anything but a real computer.

703
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,880
Scott: And so that's why you have a real computer.

704
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:18,279
Scott: Yeah.

705
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:23,059
Scott: The other thing you can do, right, is a lot of people out there, they're paying money for virtual console games.

706
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:29,620
Scott: They're paying money for all sorts of other, you know, downloaded games that you could just emulate.

707
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,200
Scott: And if you have a real computer connected to your TV, you can run all sorts of emulators.

708
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,360
Rym: I don't even feel bad about the emulating because I owned pretty much all those games.

709
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,620
Scott: Yeah, I mean, technically illegal, but whatever.

710
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:46,438
Scott: I have every Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, MAME, and now I just added N64.

711
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,999
Rym: Ah, don't forget Atari.

712
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:52,139
Scott: I don't have Atari, but you could get Atari games on there, too.

713
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:52,840
Scott: All right.

714
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,440
Scott: You get all those games on one computer, takes up hardly any room.

715
00:33:56,882 --> 00:34:06,560
Scott: If the computer's powerful enough, you get some wireless Xbox 360 controllers with the adapter, and now you can sit all the way on your couch and play these games on your PC full screen.

716
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,920
Scott: On top of that, there's plenty of PC games out there, which you could even acquire legitimately.

717
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:16,159
Scott: Steam has plenty of games that are best played from the couch or the controller.

718
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:22,040
Rym: I mean, I bought Batman Arkham Asylum on Steam because it was cheaper, and my computer is a badass.

719
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,143
Rym: Right.

720
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:33,237
Scott: If you could buy a game on Steam, which is going to be around forever, versus some console, of course you're going to always prefer the Steam version, or at least maybe even a DRM-free version.

721
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,379
Rym: Yeah, because look at Steam.

722
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,100
Rym: All right, so I'm logged into my computer, I log into Steam, all my games are there.

723
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,579
Rym: Go to the HTC PC, log into Steam, all my games are there.

724
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,552
Rym: Go to any computer in the world, log into Steam, my games download, and now they're there.

725
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,080
Rym: Yeah.

726
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:49,279
Scott: So, I guess the same is true for Xbox, kind of.

727
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,679
Rym: Kind of, but not as easy.

728
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:56,639
Rym: How easy is it for me to go to your place, log into your Xbox, and then play my games without messing stuff up?

729
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,340
Scott: Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.

730
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,500
Rym: Or typing passwords in in front of people.

731
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:09,197
Scott: But if you look on Steam, there's plenty of games on Steam that are actually, while they are PC games, because you play them on a PC, they're actually much more suited to television play.

732
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,715
Scott: All right.

733
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:13,040
Scott: For example, right, Bastion, I made a big mistake.

734
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,760
Scott: I didn't think that would come out for PC, so I bought it on Xbox.

735
00:35:15,941 --> 00:35:17,058
Scott: But look, it came out for PC.

736
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:18,539
Scott: Oops, I should have bought it on Steam.

737
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,075
Scott: Right?

738
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:21,700
Scott: Let's see what else is on here.

739
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,260
Scott: Oh, Limbo, which has been on Xbox the longest time.

740
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,780
Scott: Glad I didn't buy it, because now it's on Steam.

741
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,640
Scott: And I could go buy it on Steam instead of buying it on Xbox.

742
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,399
Scott: Also, Xbox Play Scene never has sales or free games, right?

743
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:42,159
Scott: Steam has mega sales, and also PCs in general have tons of free games, and many of which you could play with the controller from your couch.

744
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:42,588
Rym: Yep.

745
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,580
Scott: HDPC can't be beat.

746
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,080
Scott: Also, a lot of people out there going away from the games, right?

747
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,116
Scott: A lot of people out there have TiVo's and shit like that, or DVR's built into the cable box.

748
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,736
Scott: Well, guess what?

749
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:55,900
Scott: A PC can also be DVR.

750
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,080
Scott: You just slap a capture card in there, and you're good.

751
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:16,000
Rym: Well, the thing is, I have, like, my fancy TV actually did come with a sort of, like, internet thing where you can plug an ethernet cable into it, and it says it'll play videos and, like, get stuff from your computers on your local network and get stuff online and some sort of Yahoo thing.

752
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,518
Rym: But it sucks.

753
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:19,020
Rym: It sucks so hard.

754
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,840
Rym: I've never in my life seen a TV that had a reasonable interface for anything.

755
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,500
Scott: Right, so if you get a PC, obviously the interface isn't ideal.

756
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,420
Scott: Using the mouse and keyboard from the couch to go around the Windows desktop is not so great.

757
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,619
Rym: But you can use two things.

758
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,040
Scott: You can use, number one, Windows Media Center, right?

759
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,219
Scott: Which is great, but it only has support for a certain number of things, but the interface is awesome, and it's great at DVR-ing and stuff like that.

760
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:44,840
Scott: And Boxee, which is totally free.

761
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,600
Scott: You don't need a Boxee box, just install Boxee, which is free on a real computer.

762
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,498
Scott: And guess what?

763
00:36:49,640 --> 00:37:08,170
Scott: Now you've got this great interface that you can easily use from your couch or just four arrows and a button like an iPod, sort of, to go look at YouTube, to go look at Crunchyroll, to watch TED videos, to College Humor, you know, watch any video file you've got on any drive on your whole network that's accessible, you know, all kinds of stuff just sitting there.

764
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:10,059
Scott: Netflix is even on Boxee.

765
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:23,039
Rym: Well, it's more, the real selling point is that family, people who don't have a computer hooked up to the TV, don't really experience the kind of interesting communal behavior that we've seen that people who have this sort of setup do.

766
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,940
Scott: Yeah, I think it's one of those things, right, where people don't realize what they're missing because they don't have it.

767
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,339
Scott: And if you try to convince them they need it, they say, "Oh, I haven't had it yet.

768
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:31,173
Scott: Why would I need it

769
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:31,418
Scott: now?".

770
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:34,759
Scott: But once you have it, you realize, "How did I ever live without

771
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:34,900
Scott: this?".

772
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,051
Rym: I mean, the internet is basically my pastime when I'm sitting around in front of a TV where before it would be TV.

773
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:41,295
Scott: Yep.

774
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,899
Rym: Before it was what?

775
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,200
Rym: Before we came to RIT was the last time we had cable.

776
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,120
Scott: Yeah, and every time, you know, look at like Hulu, right?

777
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,780
Scott: Hulu's trying to charge you money to use Hulu on the Xbox.

778
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:53,280
Scott: You can just go to Hulu.com on a real computer.

779
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,660
Rym: Yeah, even Boxee, the Hulu/Boxee thing won't let you watch certain stuff.

780
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:57,779
Scott: Without paying.

781
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,840
Scott: But you can still, the point is, Xbox won't let you watch anything.

782
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:09,880
Rym: Some shows in Hulu are marked as free, but not available on any mobile or TV connected device.

783
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,720
Scott: But you can just watch them in the real browser.

784
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,025
Scott: Yeah.

785
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,120
Scott: Because you have a real computer connected to your TV and not some Apple TV or Xbox.

786
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,640
Scott: You have a real computer, so Hulu doesn't know.

787
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,919
Scott: They think you're sitting at your desk.

788
00:38:22,345 --> 00:38:23,059
Scott: They don't give a shit.

789
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,360
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty much great in every way, but I don't think we need to sell you guys on that.

790
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,360
Scott: Well, the thing is, I had to sell it because so many people are like averse to it.

791
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:29,977
Scott: They're like, "Screw

792
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:30,080
Scott: that.".

793
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,380
Scott: You got to open the HTBC show selling people on it.

794
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,599
Rym: Yeah, you got to have the culture of it.

795
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:42,400
Rym: Our friends come over, we play a board game or whatever, and when the night's winding down, we kind of gravitate over to the TV and it's YouTube Russian Roulette.

796
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:42,805
Rym: Yeah.

797
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,880
Rym: Until Scott Johnson gets the keyboard.

798
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,009
Scott: Yeah, that's the other thing.

799
00:38:46,029 --> 00:38:46,719
Scott: You got to be careful.

800
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,140
Scott: If you got an HTBC that's shared, some people are not so good with the keyboard.

801
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,779
Scott: They're not efficient.

802
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,916
Scott: So everyone's sitting there going, "Oh, come

803
00:38:54,138 --> 00:38:54,219
Scott: on.".

804
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,208
Scott: I don't care if they're slow.

805
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,240
Rym: Here's the problem person.

806
00:38:58,622 --> 00:39:03,299
Rym: The person who really wants to show everybody something and they wrestle the keyboard away, they've got the reins.

807
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,360
Rym: You realize this is the modern equivalent of a drum circle for geeks.

808
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,820
Rym: So they get the drum and they start pounding in some 10-minute video no one gives a shit about.

809
00:39:14,926 --> 00:39:15,800
Rym: You got to have a gong.

810
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,539
Rym: I feel like I want to order a tiny gong and put it next to the TV.

811
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,280
Scott: See, here's my problem though.

812
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:29,156
Scott: Sometimes I'll be like, if your mood, even if you have a good something, something real good, but your mood clashes with the group mood, right?

813
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:37,700
Scott: And it seems like the group mood always trends towards lowest common denominator and shortest attention span all the time as the group size increases.

814
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,600
Rym: I've shown people 30-second videos worth 10 seconds in.

815
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,413
Rym: They're like, "How long is

816
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:41,657
Rym: this?".

817
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,136
Scott: Right.

818
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,260
Rym: I'm like, dude, the guy didn't even get hit in the nuts yet.

819
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,780
Scott: I'll be in a mood for something that's incredibly intelligent that might be 15 minutes long.

820
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:50,580
Rym: Or ponies.

821
00:39:50,942 --> 00:39:51,819
Rym: It's one of those two things.

822
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,319
Scott: Yeah, perhaps a TED Talk, right?

823
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:58,960
Scott: But it's like, they'll just be, you know, I can't, if you try to bring it, you'll get gonged even though it's amazing.

824
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,920
Scott: And sometimes people won't even let you bring it to the table because they're turned away even before you start playing.

825
00:40:04,141 --> 00:40:04,820
Scott: Like, how long is this?

826
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,520
Scott: And I'm like, you know, come on, don't be that guy.

827
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,480
Scott: Don't be the short attention span low intellect guy.

828
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,120
Rym: Sometimes you're not always in the mood for a long thing.

829
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,440
Rym: What if you're in the middle of socializing?

830
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,580
Rym: I mean, you've done this sometimes.

831
00:40:15,922 --> 00:40:17,160
Rym: We're sitting around socializing.

832
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,200
Rym: We're not really watching stuff.

833
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,119
Rym: The TV is just on.

834
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,260
Scott: Then don't have the TV on at all, period.

835
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,400
Rym: No, because interspersed with the socializing, like someone spots in, and then a 30 second pony video comes up.

836
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,620
Rym: We all laugh and then resume talking.

837
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,400
Scott: That's the definition of short attention span that should be avoided.

838
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,340
Rym: No, because the long attention is on the conversation, interspersed with every now and then a short funny thing.

839
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,060
Scott: That's short attention.

840
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,320
Scott: It's not attention if you keep interspersing.

841
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,120
Scott: Attention means do not go away from what you are doing at all.

842
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,720
Scott: Every time you distract, that is the opposite of attention.

843
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,440
Rym: No, but it's not a short attention span because it's not limited.

844
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,319
Scott: The span was short.

845
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,760
Scott: It was shortened because you could not pay attention for a long period of time.

846
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,660
Scott: As soon as you stop paying attention, that is the end of the span.

847
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,162
Rym: But it's got.

848
00:40:58,182 --> 00:41:02,040
Rym: usually the conversation and the media are integrated in some way.

849
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:10,453
Rym: Like we're talking about old movies, and then we keep bringing up the movie trailers relevant to the movies we're talking about, and then out of nowhere, you're like, "Let's watch this half hour TED

850
00:41:10,493 --> 00:41:10,735
Rym: Talk.".

851
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:12,518
Scott: I don't know.

852
00:41:13,342 --> 00:41:13,955
Rym: That's what you do.

853
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:14,918
Scott: That's not what I do.

854
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,516
Rym: That's why.

855
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:18,220
Rym: The other thing is, it'll be the end of the night.

856
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,339
Rym: Time to go to bed.

857
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:23,360
Rym: We're going to watch Hush Not Quiet Now, and then we're going to lay our sleepy heads.

858
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,060
Rym: Everyone's about to leave.

859
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:28,360
Rym: We're going to watch one last thing, like one last nut shot.

860
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,098
Rym: And then you're like, "Oh, I know just what to

861
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:31,380
Rym: watch.".

862
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:32,819
Rym: It's like an hour-long lecture.

863
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,459
Scott: Yeah, to go to sleep.

864
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:38,220
Scott: How else do you want to go to sleep?

865
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
Scott: Something that's exciting in two seconds isn't going to put you to sleep.

866
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,240
Rym: That one XKCD was very, I don't know, illustrative of this whole situation.

867
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,640
Scott: But anyway, let's talk about HTPC hardware.

868
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:52,000
Rym: So you pretty much have three options.

869
00:41:52,981 --> 00:41:58,620
Scott: Well, problem number one, you need your HTPC to be small, quiet, energy efficient.

870
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:02,380
Rym: I'm going to say that quiet matters more than all of those things.

871
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,540
Scott: Quiet does matter the most because you're watching a movie.

872
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,118
Scott: You can't have "zzzz" going on.

873
00:42:07,242 --> 00:42:10,900
Scott: I even turn off my air conditioner if I'm watching a movie because it's too loud.

874
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,659
Scott: Can't hear the movie.

875
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,899
Rym: Yeah, and my real computer, I would not put that anywhere other than my computer room.

876
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,640
Scott: My real computer is also quiet.

877
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,299
Rym: Mine is quiet, except when I'm editing video and then the extra fan kicks in.

878
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,020
Scott: Oh yeah, right.

879
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,560
Scott: So you need it to be small, incredibly quiet, and also powerful enough to push HD videos without lagging or anything.

880
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:31,820
Scott: And also powerful enough to play a bunch of games.

881
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:38,420
Scott: But you still want it to be small and quiet, so it can't be so powerful that it's like this mega-GPU beast.

882
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,959
Rym: Well, you might not need the power, you might just need HD.

883
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,436
Rym: You might not care about playing the game.

884
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:43,880
Rym: Some people don't.

885
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,800
Scott: The thing is, if you don't care about playing the games, Mac Mini, end of story.

886
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:49,347
Rym: As much as I hate-- No, no, no, no.

887
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:50,660
Rym: There are other options there.

888
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,520
Scott: What are the other options?

889
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,420
Rym: Actually, there are some-- I forget what company it was, but they made a little Mac Mini clone.

890
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:57,918
Rym: I think Samsung has one now, too.

891
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,826
Scott: There's a few cut--.

892
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:00,180
Scott: Dell makes a tiny thing, I think.

893
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:00,659
Scott: And you know what?

894
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,480
Scott: Zotac makes a bunch of tiny things.

895
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:06,420
Rym: They're way cheaper than the Mac Mini and just as powerful.

896
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,083
Scott: No, they're not.

897
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:08,352
Scott: They're not just as powerful.

898
00:43:08,413 --> 00:43:09,300
Scott: This is the thing, right?

899
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,760
Scott: The Mac Mini, while it is $600 or $700-- Alright, Scott, let me qualify that.

900
00:43:13,061 --> 00:43:18,240
Rym: Just as powerful if all you want to do is stream HD video from somewhere.

901
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,220
Scott: No, all those little tiny computers that aren't made by Apple, I've looked into this.

902
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,900
Scott: All the Zotacs and things, they're running like Atom CPUs.

903
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,184
Scott: They're like netbooks.

904
00:43:26,224 --> 00:43:27,834
Scott: They can't do 1080p's smoothly.

905
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,338
Scott: The Mac Mini now, I believe, has like an i3 or an i5.

906
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,470
Scott: Yeah, it has an HDMI port in it.

907
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:37,640
Scott: It can push whatever the fuck you want.

908
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,491
Scott: It can do better than 1080p's.

909
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,860
Rym: Scott, the thing is, one, you're probably looking at the low end of these models.

910
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,180
Rym: Because if you go up to the higher ends of these things, they're still way cheaper than the Mac Mini.

911
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,971
Rym: They can push 1080p just fine.

912
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,020
Scott: I'll go look for one while we continue.

913
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,340
Scott: But anyway, you get some-- you know, Ibram is right.

914
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,480
Scott: Get some small, already-built computer if you don't care about gaming.

915
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,148
Rym: But I guess there is a distinction.

916
00:43:58,228 --> 00:44:00,060
Rym: You don't always need the Mac Mini.

917
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,840
Rym: There are options that will work.

918
00:44:01,981 --> 00:44:07,020
Scott: Yeah, you might be so anti-Apple to begin with, but the point is-- I'm only anti the price.

919
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,860
Rym: You realize that the Mac Mini, the cheapest one, is not that great even.

920
00:44:12,544 --> 00:44:13,369
Rym: And it's $600, like minimum.

921
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:22,240
Scott: I mean, I'm just anti OS X, but the point is, if you're on an HDPC and you don't care about games, that's pretty great.

922
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:31,320
Scott: But at the same time-- Well, there is one advantage, though, to the non-Apples that I cannot neglect to point out, is that Apple doesn't even have optical drive anymore.

923
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:34,139
Scott: And, you know, not that you need one.

924
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:37,440
Scott: But the non-Apple stuff, a lot of them have Bure.

925
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,409
Scott: So if you're-- I hate Bure.

926
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:41,300
Scott: I think you're stupid to waste money on Bure.

927
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:44,622
Scott: But if you're, you know, maybe you're so hardcore-- I thought about Bure.

928
00:44:44,663 --> 00:44:46,451
Rym: I built my HDPC and I put a $9 DVD-R.

929
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,029
Rym: Not even on RW.

930
00:44:50,886 --> 00:44:52,040
Rym: And by R, I mean Reed.

931
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,677
Rym: And I looked, I was like, "Oh, maybe I should get the

932
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:56,899
Rym: Bure.".

933
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,149
Rym: And I look online, I'm like, "Huh.

934
00:44:59,149 --> 00:44:59,611
Scott: 60 bucks.

935
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:01,178
Scott: Eh.".

936
00:45:02,087 --> 00:45:02,718
Rym: And I didn't do it.

937
00:45:03,603 --> 00:45:04,570
Rym: I spent the $9 on the DVD-ROM.

938
00:45:07,841 --> 00:45:13,200
Scott: Anyway, so if you, uh, maybe you don't want to get something that's already built.

939
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,778
Scott: You want to build your own something that's going to be a good HDPC.

940
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,360
Rym: Well, then there are still two real options.

941
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,259
Rym: Yeah, the thing is-- Well, no, there's three, but the third option is the ghetto PC.

942
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:29,259
Rym: Which, you know what, if you don't have money, any PC, even if you're connecting it with S-video, is better than no PC.

943
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:30,199
Scott: That's true.

944
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,339
Rym: So if you've got, like, an old tower-- Just get an old, busted laptop.

945
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,780
Scott: Yeah, get an old tower and stick it next to there.

946
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,495
Rym: Maybe it's going to be SD.

947
00:45:37,536 --> 00:45:37,900
Rym: Who cares?

948
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:38,810
Rym: It's still the internet.

949
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:39,480
Rym: It's still video.

950
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,740
Rym: You can see the guy getting hit in the nuts just fine.

951
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,743
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

952
00:45:42,803 --> 00:45:46,480
Scott: I mean, that old Core Solo Mac Mini worked for a long time.

953
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,999
Rym: Hell, before we had the Core Solo, we had this tower PC just sitting next to the TV.

954
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:56,060
Rym: And it was plugged in through an adapter with S-video.

955
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,378
Rym: It barely worked.

956
00:45:59,146 --> 00:45:59,736
Rym: But we used it.

957
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:00,578
Scott: Yeah.

958
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:03,440
Rym: I just suddenly remembered that when we got to RIT, there was no YouTube.

959
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,618
Rym: Times have changed.

960
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:14,100
Scott: So here's a Zotac ZBox AMD E350 APU 1.6 GHz dual-core with HD memory and Blu-ray all-in-one mini PC.

961
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,200
Scott: That could do the trick, but it's still a little bit on the slow end.

962
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:19,854
Rym: It's probably fast enough for 1080p.

963
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,560
Scott: It's probably good enough for most people, and it does have Blu-ray, but 1.6 GHz dual-core is a little on the weak side.

964
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:28,960
Scott: So if you try to push it, you might get some lagging.

965
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:29,949
Scott: But the box looks real nice.

966
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:37,100
Rym: What I'm saying is things like that are fine if the highest you go is playing your Blu-ray video.

967
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,472
Rym: Yeah.

968
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:38,760
Scott: Anyway.

969
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,360
Scott: So if you're going to build something, the first thing you've got to look at, actually, is the case, because there's so few HDPC cases.

970
00:46:46,740 --> 00:47:02,459
Scott: I mean, maybe you don't care that you have something that doesn't look like a piece of home theater equipment, or you don't care if it's just a big mid-tower next to your TV, in which case, just build a computer that has a video card that has an HDMI output on it for whatever you're willing to spend, and you're good to go.

971
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:07,320
Scott: If you do care, there's really not that many cases to go with.

972
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,580
Rym: Yeah, and pretty much they make the only ones that are worth getting.

973
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,779
Rym: Well, unless you already have one option here.

974
00:47:14,621 --> 00:47:19,540
Rym: You have to decide straight up if you're making a real one, like a small HDPC, not just a big tower.

975
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:24,339
Rym: If you're going to go micro-ATX or mini-ITX.

976
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:31,740
Scott: Well, mini-ITX, right, you might as well buy something like this Zotac ZBox, where they've already done it for you, which is even smaller.

977
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,400
Scott: To put together your own ITX computer is a nightmare.

978
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:36,568
Rym: It's not a nightmare.

979
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,140
Rym: It's not nearly as bad as it used to be.

980
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,506
Scott: It's not as bad as it used to be.

981
00:47:39,586 --> 00:47:40,993
Scott: It's still bad, and good luck.

982
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:44,460
Scott: getting the heat not to overheat, and making the fans not loud.

983
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,180
Rym: There are some really nice mini-ITX cases that have really good cooling and are really quiet.

984
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:57,039
Scott: It's a lot bigger pain in the ass than you think, and you won't be able to get the horsepower enough to equal the same price as the already built box.

985
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:57,861
Rym: Well, this is it.

986
00:47:57,901 --> 00:48:04,260
Rym: The only drawback to the ITX, in my opinion now, is that you cannot install a video card.

987
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:07,949
Rym: In pretty much any case you would get that warrants.

988
00:48:09,232 --> 00:48:11,860
Rym: the mini-ITX will not have a video card that will fit in it.

989
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,060
Scott: You're better off if you want something that small, get it already put together by someone else in a box.

990
00:48:17,442 --> 00:48:19,475
Scott: It'll be cheaper, more powerful, better, etc.

991
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:30,039
Rym: There are some really nice cases, though, and you can make one that's way powerful, and in that tiny case, and the only problem there will be that it might be slightly loud.

992
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,900
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, you can go and you can get a micro-ATX case.

993
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:42,015
Scott: Now, if you don't care about how small it is, you can get one that's sort of boxy, not boxy the app, but boxy in shape, right?

994
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:42,980
Scott: Sort of like the shuttle cases.

995
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,100
Scott: And you can just fit a computer in there, no problem.

996
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:56,260
Scott: But if you want something that looks like home theater equipment, something that's horizontal, looks like a DVD player, fits in, is all classy, there's only one case to get the one that we got.

997
00:48:56,701 --> 00:49:04,459
Scott: And all the other ones are all ugly and gamer-y, or got sort of freaky fans and lights and glass on them, and they're all, they look like gamer PCs, and they don't work.

998
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:11,040
Rym: I found a lot of them that looked really good, but they either didn't fit the video card the way I wanted, or they were way expensive.

999
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:19,740
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is that they're gonna, if you get something small, even if it's micro-ATX, it's gonna be low profile, which means you're gonna have to get a video card that's not so tall.

1000
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:26,879
Scott: Now, there are video cards you can get that are not so tall, they're low profile, that are still powerful enough to, you know, do what you need them to do.

1001
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:28,867
Scott: I got one, Rym has one.

1002
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:47,100
Scott: But, if you need, if you want to get a real video card, 'cause you want to play some serious, brand new game, I don't see the point, 'cause most of those games are mouse and keyboard, and you can't use them from your couch, then you need to get something that's not low profile, and they do make some taller cases, there's, you know, instead of being as tall as a DVD player, they're as tall as like an audio receiver.

1003
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:54,360
Rym: Actually, what's cool, Lian Li, we got the PC-C37B, micro-ATX media center, HDPC case.

1004
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:00,280
Rym: They make an identical case that is just bigger, it is ATX instead of micro-ATX.

1005
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,863
Rym: Exactly.

1006
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:03,260
Scott: So you can get that one, but it's big, so make sure you have room.

1007
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,032
Rym: You probably don't need it, because...

1008
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,155
Scott: You can get a pretty good low profile video card.

1009
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:08,860
Scott: that's gonna cover you.

1010
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,460
Rym: Well, the way they work, let's go through all the hardware.

1011
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,380
Rym: So, say, let's assume you're going micro-ATX, because you're gonna build like a default HDPC.

1012
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:17,959
Rym: I'll link to the one I built, 'cause it's pretty good.

1013
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:24,800
Rym: Just go on Newegg, find the best low profile Nvidia card there is, and just buy it.

1014
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,240
Rym: It won't be more than a hundred bucks.

1015
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,900
Scott: I know there's some ATI fanboys out there.

1016
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,246
Rym: Fuck you.

1017
00:50:28,267 --> 00:50:29,000
Rym: You're wrong.

1018
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:30,080
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

1019
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,268
Scott: So wrong.

1020
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,788
Scott: You know, here's the thing.

1021
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:32,900
Scott: Number one, right?

1022
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,000
Scott: I actually have ATI in my HDPC, and it kinda works.

1023
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:36,807
Scott: But you know what?

1024
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:37,619
Rym: Here's some problems.

1025
00:50:39,341 --> 00:50:41,820
Scott: Remember Rym, how you had problems, like the overscan with your Nvidia?

1026
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,979
Scott: You had to work it out.

1027
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:44,999
Scott: The ATI was ten times worse than that.

1028
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:45,289
Scott: Really?

1029
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,220
Scott: Yeah, and it's only 'cause I finally got it configured and never touched it again that it stayed that way.

1030
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:50,779
Scott: It was ten times worse.

1031
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,259
Rym: Yeah, 'cause mine, once I found the menu, was all set.

1032
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,720
Scott: Which you did a very bad job of finding.

1033
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:58,800
Rym: Scott, do you realize how easy it is to troll?

1034
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:08,197
Rym: So whenever Scott's in front of an HDPC, and anyone does something even slightly out of the way, or he sees a config or anything that bothers him, he'll get mad and be like, "Oh, you should change

1035
00:51:08,218 --> 00:51:08,378
Rym: this.".

1036
00:51:09,061 --> 00:51:13,259
Rym: And pretty much everyone in the crew will sit there and be like, "No, Scott, you're

1037
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,480
Rym: wrong.".

1038
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,660
Rym: Just argue with him, troll face, and he doesn't seem to realize we're trolling.

1039
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,939
Scott: 'Cause if you actually are trolling, then that means you know I'm right, which means why wouldn't you want to change it?

1040
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,660
Rym: Because we change it when you're gone.

1041
00:51:26,644 --> 00:51:28,319
Scott: How could you not want to change it immediately?

1042
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,197
Rym: Scott, I had edge enhancement turned off when I first got my TV.

1043
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:32,760
Rym: You know what happened?

1044
00:51:33,462 --> 00:51:35,559
Rym: I updated the firmware and it reset all the settings.

1045
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,858
Scott: Why'd you update the firmware on your TV?

1046
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,600
Rym: 'Cause I had an ass-old firmware.

1047
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:39,740
Scott: What does it matter?

1048
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:41,329
Rym: I just updated it to see.

1049
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:42,720
Rym: I wanted to see how well it worked, actually.

1050
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:43,929
Scott: Anyway.

1051
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:49,360
Rym: Also, it claimed that it would give me a better TV streaming experience if I used the internet.

1052
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:51,700
Scott: Yeah, this is something we should talk about in general, right?

1053
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,760
Scott: Is your TV is also part of your HDVC, right?

1054
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,696
Scott: You can't separate the TV from the computer.

1055
00:51:58,917 --> 00:51:59,420
Scott: They go together.

1056
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,580
Scott: So you have to make sure that all your settings on the TV are correct.

1057
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:13,679
Scott: You want to make sure... See, TVs, you can put them in 16 by 9 mode, but you have to make sure you've got to put it in pixel by pixel mode if you've got the PC connected to it so that all the display is correct, right?

1058
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:22,339
Rym: Well, one, at the very least, we should go through the whole hardware first to get the TV, because the TV really depends on the hardware, which depends on the fact that you're gonna have HDMI.

1059
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:25,327
Scott: Yeah, if you don't have HDMI, give up.

1060
00:52:25,347 --> 00:52:28,380
Scott: You're gonna have a 1080p HDTV with HDMI port.

1061
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,630
Scott: That's what you're gonna have.

1062
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,500
Scott: It doesn't matter which one.

1063
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:30,680
Scott: A

1064
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:42,020
Rym: lot of people don't have the HDMI, or they're afraid of it, because one thing that a lot of people don't realize, normally when you plug a TV into a computer, there's like a VGA port in the back of the TV, and then you plug the sound in separately.

1065
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:42,657
Scott: Yeah, don't use that.

1066
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,700
Rym: Well, HDMI, the sound comes over the HDMI cable along with the video, so...

1067
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,140
Scott: As long as you set your mixer settings, right?

1068
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:54,300
Rym: So before you despair and wonder how you're gonna do that, I will solve the mystery of the ages for all of you.

1069
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:03,140
Rym: Every video card that has HDMI on it, worth a shit, meaning all the Nvidia ones made recently, have a sound card in them.

1070
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:11,460
Rym: So when you install the video card, it installs a video card driver and a sound card driver, and you just use that as your sound card, and it goes to the TV.

1071
00:53:11,741 --> 00:53:17,219
Scott: I've even seen some video cards where you have a little connector that you can connect audio from the...

1072
00:53:18,221 --> 00:53:20,340
Rym: Oh, that's if you have SPDIF, if you're video card cheating.

1073
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,403
Scott: No, not even SPDIF.

1074
00:53:21,423 --> 00:53:22,827
Scott: You know, what's it called?

1075
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:27,720
Scott: The HD audio connector that's usually used to connect the headphones on the front deck.

1076
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,880
Rym: Oh, yeah, I saw a couple with that.

1077
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,542
Scott: I've seen a couple of those.

1078
00:53:29,562 --> 00:53:33,800
Scott: You connect that connector to the video card, and then it pipes that into the HDMI.

1079
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,360
Rym: Seriously, though, the easiest thing to do is just get an Nvidia card that has the sound card in it.

1080
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,431
Rym: Then it'll just work.

1081
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:40,320
Rym: You don't have to do anything.

1082
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:47,380
Scott: Now, if you have a surround sound setup like me, you might need to use some sort of optical audio out going to a receiver or something else.

1083
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,899
Rym: That's way out of the scope of this show.

1084
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,200
Scott: Go listen to a home theater episode or something like that to figure that shit out.

1085
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,080
Scott: I think we did a surround sound episode.

1086
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,250
Scott: We did.

1087
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,278
Scott: It goes into that one.

1088
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,106
Rym: So, power supply.

1089
00:53:57,629 --> 00:53:59,900
Rym: Pretty much get, like, an Antec EarthWatts.

1090
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,568
Scott: Get something, you know, you gotta concentrate.

1091
00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:05,460
Scott: Too many people get too big a wattage on their, you know, power supplies.

1092
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:10,280
Rym: Well, for a non-HTPC, you pretty much go all out on the wattage, because actually...

1093
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:10,823
Scott: Not necessarily.

1094
00:54:10,843 --> 00:54:13,420
Scott: You just need to make sure you have enough wattage for what you're doing.

1095
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:17,516
Rym: Well, Scott, when I say all out, I mean, alright, I need about 500, so I get the 700 one, 'cause whatever.

1096
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,086
Scott: Well, not necessarily.

1097
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:23,340
Scott: You know, you gotta look at how many plugs you need on your video card, right?

1098
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:29,720
Scott: If you're doing, say, you know, one video card that needs two plugs, you could probably get away with 500, 550.

1099
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:35,500
Scott: If you're doing two video cards, you probably need the 700, 'cause that's the only one that's gonna have the four plugs you need for two video cards.

1100
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,200
Rym: Or if you got the ton of hard drives, or you're doing something fancy.

1101
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:42,240
Scott: If you have too many hard drives, you might run out of power connectors, then you might need more wattage.

1102
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:48,360
Rym: But the real key is that, you know, 500 watts or so is pretty much already overkill for your HTPC.

1103
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,160
Scott: Yeah, 'cause remember, you're not getting a crazy video card, you're not getting an i7, you're putting like an i3 in there, right?

1104
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,540
Scott: You don't need the most powerful CPU in the world.

1105
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:03,800
Rym: And more importantly, get an 80+, because that means it's gonna be way efficient, and they tend to be better power supplies.

1106
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,920
Scott: Go for efficiency and quietness above all other factors.

1107
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:11,631
Rym: I highly recommend the Antec EarthWatts series.

1108
00:55:11,711 --> 00:55:14,760
Rym: They are very cheap, they're lacking in the features.

1109
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,779
Rym: They're not like modular or anything, they're really kind of lowball on that front.

1110
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:24,962
Rym: But for the rest of it, they're a fine power supply, with good wattage, good voltage control, and they're 80+.

1111
00:55:24,962 --> 00:55:28,900
Scott: Now, the optical drive, normally you just buy a $20 optical drive, like who gives a crap?

1112
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,239
Rym: You can get it for like 10 bucks now.

1113
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,720
Scott: But, some of them are loud, especially the cheap ones.

1114
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:40,699
Scott: So, most people, right, I imagine, even though I just told you, screw using the Xbox, right, use your, you know, HDBC.

1115
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:53,778
Scott: Well, if you're just watching a DVD, and it's a legit DVD, and you don't need to get, say, you know, region free or anything like that, you're probably just better off playing the Xbox, you know, rather than having the very loud optical drive in your HDBC.

1116
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:59,400
Rym: Now, if you don't have an Xbox, invest the money in a quieter, more expensive optical drive.

1117
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:03,220
Scott: And they actually, as much as I hate the booray, you know, you never know when a booray might show up.

1118
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,846
Scott: Someone might bring one over, right?

1119
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:08,720
Scott: You might, you know, and it's not that much of an investment to get a booray reading drive.

1120
00:56:09,127 --> 00:56:09,600
Rym: Like 70 bucks.

1121
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,082
Scott: Right.

1122
00:56:10,407 --> 00:56:13,220
Rym: So, maybe you can- And they almost all come with the software you'll need.

1123
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,494
Scott: So, if this is going to be your primary optical disc playing drive, you might just want to buy one.

1124
00:56:18,534 --> 00:56:20,780
Scott: that's got everything, that is quiet and awesome.

1125
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,380
Rym: Now, do not get a slot loader under any circumstances.

1126
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:25,379
Scott: Under no circumstances.

1127
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:25,856
Scott: This is fucked.

1128
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,786
Scott: Get a slot loader.

1129
00:56:26,987 --> 00:56:28,840
Scott: Make sure you get the tray loader.

1130
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:36,180
Rym: Not only are they loud, but if you get this Lian Li case, you can't use a slot loader because it's designed to hide your optical drive behind a door.

1131
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,347
Rym: Yep.

1132
00:56:37,368 --> 00:56:38,398
Scott: Gotta pay attention to that kind of thing.

1133
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,061
Rym: Yep.

1134
00:56:39,081 --> 00:56:40,528
Rym: So, hard drive, whatever.

1135
00:56:40,628 --> 00:56:43,040
Rym: Just get the cheapest Western Digital Caviar.

1136
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:43,790
Scott: Well, hold on.

1137
00:56:43,852 --> 00:56:44,158
Scott: Hold on.

1138
00:56:44,981 --> 00:56:51,380
Scott: If you're the kind of person who has a NAS and computers with network shares and things like that, just get whatever cheapo hard drive you can get.

1139
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:56,557
Scott: In fact, I would recommend getting something like, I don't know, a very small and cheap SSD.

1140
00:56:56,557 --> 00:56:56,778
Scott: 16 gigs.

1141
00:56:58,144 --> 00:57:00,137
Scott: You can install Windows in a 16 gig SSD.

1142
00:57:00,197 --> 00:57:00,600
Scott: Do you know that?

1143
00:57:01,203 --> 00:57:02,391
Rym: You know what I can't install, though?

1144
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:03,700
Rym: Any of my games.

1145
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:04,872
Scott: Well, that's true.

1146
00:57:04,933 --> 00:57:05,300
Scott: That's true.

1147
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:07,132
Rym: Or StepMania, even.

1148
00:57:07,273 --> 00:57:08,180
Rym: You know, any of that stuff.

1149
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,127
Rym: Or, say someone brings a video over on a USB stick.

1150
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:10,327
Rym: Now what?

1151
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,280
Scott: Play it off the USB stick.

1152
00:57:14,623 --> 00:57:15,940
Rym: Yeah, that doesn't work so well.

1153
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:16,947
Rym: It works.

1154
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:17,654
Scott: You'd be surprised.

1155
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:18,220
Scott: It works real well.

1156
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:18,736
Scott: Depends.

1157
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:28,300
Scott: Anyway, you could possibly get away, if you have a NAS or something like that, with a small SSD, and that would get you a lot of quietness going on.

1158
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:38,480
Scott: But, if you don't have the NAS and the network sharing, you don't know how to make it work, you don't have gigabit, something like that, just get a terabyte drive and slap it in there and load all the fucking videos in the world on it.

1159
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,360
Rym: Yeah, don't raid, don't anything.

1160
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,811
Scott: Yeah, you know, but the thing is, don't store any data on there.

1161
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:44,299
Scott: that's important, because it's hard to get at.

1162
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:45,042
Scott: Right?

1163
00:57:45,142 --> 00:57:51,559
Scott: If you want to get the data off of there, you gotta either network it, or you gotta go and plug a USB stick and use a mouse and keyboard on a TV screen, that sucks.

1164
00:57:51,920 --> 00:58:03,980
Rym: The one option, because hard drives don't add much loudness, if you don't have a lot of computers, and you want to spend a little more money, get a few hard drives, put them in there, and make it also be your, you know, bootleg NAS.

1165
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,968
Scott: This is something else about the HTPC, right?

1166
00:58:05,988 --> 00:58:08,739
Scott: You're only using the HTPC, when you're sitting in front of the TV.

1167
00:58:09,001 --> 00:58:13,060
Scott: And you're still gonna sit in front of your desktop, or your laptop, or something else, quite often.

1168
00:58:13,181 --> 00:58:15,380
Scott: So, that computer's just sitting there doing nothing.

1169
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,720
Rym: So either, put it to sleep whenever you're not using it.

1170
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,420
Scott: You can A, have it go to sleep and be incredibly power efficient.

1171
00:58:20,941 --> 00:58:26,320
Scott: Two, you can use something like Boink, and have it do some work, you know, at home, do some processing for science.

1172
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,720
Scott: Three, you can have it be like a Counter-Strike server or something, when it's not being your HTPC, right?

1173
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:39,660
Scott: You know, it can be your NAS, it can do all sorts of other things, when you're not watching TV, because it is an extra computer, why waste it?

1174
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:40,202
Scott: Right?

1175
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:44,140
Scott: It can do all sorts of stuff to better your life in computing realms, right?

1176
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,200
Scott: For example, Apple tries to sell you a separate Apple TV and Time Capsule.

1177
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:51,400
Scott: Why not have Time Capsule and Apple TV be the same fucking thing?

1178
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,726
Scott: There's no reason not to, right?

1179
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:57,357
Scott: The Time Capsule's not doing anything if, you know, you're watching TV.

1180
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:01,918
Rym: So, CPU motherboard, get an Intel Core i3.

1181
00:59:03,062 --> 00:59:03,867
Scott: Right, now at least.

1182
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:05,377
Scott: And, you know, if you're listening to this...

1183
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:09,690
Rym: As of August 15th, 2011, the fastest Intel Core i3 is way cheap.

1184
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:19,940
Rym: And you don't need the i5, because all the i5 gives you, for the purposes of this, is more cores.

1185
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:24,780
Rym: You're not going to be multitasking that much, and the i3 already has two cores.

1186
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,900
Scott: That is another thing about an HTPC, is it's almost always single task.

1187
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,291
Scott: You're hardly ever going to be multitasking anything.

1188
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:33,240
Scott: You're going to be watching a video, playing a game.

1189
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,975
Rym: Say I run a Counter Strike server, and I'm watching a video.

1190
00:59:36,276 --> 00:59:36,900
Rym: Two cores!

1191
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,345
Scott: Yeah, you're good.

1192
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,560
Scott: Who's doing more than two things at once?

1193
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,673
Rym: At least on an HTPC.

1194
00:59:42,461 --> 00:59:42,957
Scott: Almost nobody.

1195
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:52,420
Rym: In terms of motherboard, whatever, get some sort of Intel H61 chipset, and make sure you get an LGA 1155.

1196
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,772
Rym: That is actually better than 1156, which is the old out-of-date standard.

1197
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,759
Rym: They made the number go down, I don't know why.

1198
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:02,139
Scott: But anyway.

1199
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,201
Rym: You want LGA 1155.

1200
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:08,420
Rym: RAM, whatever, just get four or six gigs.

1201
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,840
Scott: It's the same rules for just building a computer in general, right?

1202
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:16,600
Scott: Get the fastest RAM that fits in the motherboard, make sure if it's double channel you get two sticks, triple channel three sticks.

1203
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:26,260
Rym: I pointedly only got DDR3-1333, which is actually way slower than what I could have put in, and what I could have put in my other computer, because it doesn't matter for this.

1204
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,080
Scott: That's true, but was it that much cheaper?

1205
01:00:28,261 --> 01:00:31,360
Rym: Yes, this RAM was 30 bucks, or I don't know, 90 to get the other RAM.

1206
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:38,160
Scott: Okay, that's a significant, usually I haven't seen a price difference that significant, but in that case, then absolutely get the $30 instead of the $90.

1207
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,338
Rym: Yep, because I was thinking like, "Oh, RAM's so cheap when I saw

1208
01:00:40,358 --> 01:00:40,439
Rym: this.".

1209
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,240
Scott: No reason to spend 60 bucks for no reason.

1210
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:42,628
Scott: Yeah.

1211
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:48,120
Rym: And you know, there's other little things, like maybe you have some Bluetooth stuff, you can buy like a Bluetooth dongle.

1212
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,780
Scott: Oh, that's a very important thing, we gotta talk about the interface, right?

1213
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:54,180
Scott: So, you are gonna be doing some mousing and keyboarding.

1214
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,619
Rym: Yeah, don't think boxy is gonna be the end-all be-all of your computer.

1215
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:08,100
Scott: You can buy a boxy remote, or you could use things like Logitech Touch Remote, which is an app you can install on your phone, and an app you install on the computer, and allows you to use the phone as a mouse and keyboard.

1216
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,459
Rym: You can also buy these super cheap Chinese, like wireless USB keyboards.

1217
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,800
Scott: Yeah, I used to have one of those before it was stolen, that was pretty good.

1218
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,119
Rym: Because it's a crappy keyboard, really light, that has a touchpad on it.

1219
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:26,700
Scott: Yep, Logitech also makes like a little, you know, there's plenty of devices out there that are like little handheld keyboards and mice-like devices for use on HDVCs.

1220
01:01:27,943 --> 01:01:32,313
Rym: The key here is don't think you can get away with not having a mouse.

1221
01:01:32,353 --> 01:01:35,340
Rym: You're going to need a mouse, and you're going to need a keyboard.

1222
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,146
Scott: Yes, get a wireless Bluetooth mouse, right?

1223
01:01:38,788 --> 01:01:43,620
Scott: Or just a tiny wireless mouse, doesn't have to be Bluetooth, but Bluetooth saves you an extra dongle.

1224
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,817
Scott: Same thing with keyboard, you can get-.

1225
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,500
Rym: Bluetooth doesn't, because not all motherboards have Bluetooth native.

1226
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:53,400
Rym: That's true, but if you do- I mean, I had to spend 15 bucks to get a tiny little Bluetooth dongle.

1227
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,969
Scott: That's true, but you want to basically, you know, just get wireless, tiny mouse, tiny keyboard.

1228
01:01:57,989 --> 01:02:03,500
Scott: You can use the Apple keyboard, the Apple mouse, if you really can use the Magic Mouse without killing yourself.

1229
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:08,960
Rym: Now, the Apple keyboard, if you have to get a keyboard, it's probably the best one.

1230
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,272
Scott: Well, actually, I have the Asus Triple E keyboard, if you can still find one.

1231
01:02:12,332 --> 01:02:14,320
Scott: It's also pretty- just as good as the Apple one.

1232
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:23,320
Rym: Nah, though what you could get away with, though would be annoying occasionally, is have the Boxee Box remote just for the keyboard, and then a little mouse just for the mouse.

1233
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,000
Scott: Yeah, it'd be a little hard though.

1234
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,173
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty much it on the hardware.

1235
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:29,700
Rym: I mean, it's a computer.

1236
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:39,500
Scott: Yeah, but the thing- it's mostly just about, you know, how much your TV living room experience will be revolutionized if you follow this advice, and so few people actually listen to it.

1237
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,383
Scott: They're like, "Oh my god, a whole

1238
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:40,804
Scott: computer.".

1239
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:45,960
Scott: Yeah, well, how much is your cable costing you, so when you cancel it, it'll pay for the computer in less than a year.

1240
01:02:46,482 --> 01:02:47,800
Rym: Alright, and install Windows.

1241
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,340
Rym: Yeah, Linux- You're pretty much best off having Windows installed.

1242
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:54,139
Scott: I mean, you could try to do the Linux MixMyth TV thing.

1243
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:54,936
Rym: It's not worth it.

1244
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,114
Scott: It might work, you might be able to get it to go, but you're gonna have troubles.

1245
01:02:59,134 --> 01:03:00,780
Scott: There's gonna be trouble with the codec.

1246
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,671
Scott: There's, you know, not necessarily codec because you use M-player for everything, but you'll have trouble at some point.

1247
01:03:05,711 --> 01:03:09,860
Scott: If you use Mac, you won't have any trouble, but some games aren't gonna play.

1248
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:14,160
Scott: But if you use Windows, you'll never have trouble unless you install a virus like a doofus.

1249
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:22,980
Rym: So software, install Boxee and play with it, but you're only gonna be able to spend about a half to two-thirds of your time in Boxee because there's too many things that aren't in there.

1250
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,630
Scott: Which is why, which is exactly right, it's the perfect example of why a Boxee box doesn't cut it.

1251
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:32,640
Scott: A Boxee box is like having a computer that's running Boxee all the time and there's things it can't do.

1252
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,641
Rym: Now, Boxee's great.

1253
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:34,964
Rym: I mean, there's a Crunchyroll app.

1254
01:03:35,124 --> 01:03:36,607
Rym: I watch anime on Crunchyroll.

1255
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:43,740
Rym: Oh, but if I watch the anime in the browser, I can turn the volume down when there's ads, and the ads aren't that loud.

1256
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,200
Scott: Well, you can use your TV remote to turn the volume down.

1257
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:48,600
Rym: I can, but I like to just use the Boxee remote.

1258
01:03:49,181 --> 01:03:50,344
Rym: I like to just use one thing.

1259
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:51,627
Rym: I keep fumbling for stuff.

1260
01:03:51,747 --> 01:03:54,474
Rym: And the volume shift time, it takes a while.

1261
01:03:54,534 --> 01:03:57,020
Rym: It's slow to change the volume with the TV remote.

1262
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:01,020
Scott: And plus, not to mention, right, there's some games that like StepMania.

1263
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:14,060
Rym: Yeah, I was gonna get to that, but Boxee, a lot of the apps that are there for like the Daily Show or Crunchyroll or something will play ads and will lock your volume control until the ads are done, and the ads are way louder than the show.

1264
01:04:15,182 --> 01:04:18,979
Rym: I actually kind of stopped using Crunchyroll and we're pirating things again just because of that.

1265
01:04:20,101 --> 01:04:28,920
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, just in general, all those boxes that connect to your TV, Roku's and Apple TV's, they all have these weird Boxee boxes, have weird limitations.

1266
01:04:29,441 --> 01:04:34,100
Scott: And if you just used a regular computer, it wouldn't be that much more money, and all those limitations would go away.

1267
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,143
Rym: Now, this is very important.

1268
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:37,385
Rym: You're using Windows, right?

1269
01:04:38,066 --> 01:04:47,840
Rym: Make an admin account when you make the computer, install all the shit, make another non-administrative account, and make that the one that people log into when you're not home.

1270
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,223
Scott: Yes, remember, this is an HTPC.

1271
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:50,225
Scott: It's in a living room.

1272
01:04:50,565 --> 01:04:57,920
Scott: All kinds of weird people are gonna be using it, so you wanna make sure they use some guest account that has no privileges so they can't install anything or do anything to ruin your HTPC.

1273
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,060
Rym: Yep, I made an account that has a password that is the same as the password for my wireless.

1274
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,534
Scott: Yeah, you don't wanna have no password at all.

1275
01:05:03,575 --> 01:05:04,120
Scott: That's kinda weird.

1276
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,222
Rym: And, you know what?

1277
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:06,945
Rym: Windows is pretty good about that now.

1278
01:05:07,025 --> 01:05:11,074
Rym: Anytime I need to do something that has admin privileges, it just says, "Hey, you need an admin,".

1279
01:05:11,114 --> 01:05:12,637
Rym: and me and Emily both have admin accounts.

1280
01:05:12,657 --> 01:05:14,040
Rym: We type in our password and it does the thing.

1281
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:14,521
Rym: Yep.

1282
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:16,440
Scott: But yeah, gotta watch out for that.

1283
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,720
Rym: Yep, gotta set up your Samba shares to get your stuff.

1284
01:05:18,822 --> 01:05:19,398
Scott: If you wanna do that.

1285
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,179
Rym: Maybe your own BitTorrent on the thing instead of on your own PC.

1286
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,419
Scott: That's also a good idea.

1287
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:23,728
Rym: Yeah.

1288
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,451
Scott: 'Cause then, you know, your own PC won't be clogged down doing the BitTorrents.

1289
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:30,060
Scott: The computer that's actually gonna play the videos will be doing the BitTorrents.

1290
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,139
Rym: Get yourself some emulators, install some StepMania, play some DDR.

1291
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:40,100
Scott: Also, if you follow the home theater advice, right, this thing can also, what I'll do is I've set it up so I can play music while the TV's off.

1292
01:05:40,421 --> 01:05:41,960
Scott: 'Cause I have the optical audio cable.

1293
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:48,840
Scott: So, I'll turn on the TV, open up Spotify or iTunes or whatever, play some music, you know, Last.fm, who knows what.

1294
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,336
Scott: Then turn the TV off and now it's a stereo that gets music from the internets.

1295
01:05:53,959 --> 01:05:54,300
Scott: It's great.

1296
01:05:54,601 --> 01:05:54,882
Rym: Yeah.

1297
01:05:55,584 --> 01:06:00,220
Rym: And your friends won't be asking to use your computer to figure out like their train schedule or whatever or check their email.

1298
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:05,960
Scott: Well, my solution to that is I have a public Chrome OS laptop that I got for free.

1299
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:11,595
Rym: They will also often log into stuff, not log out.

1300
01:06:12,057 --> 01:06:13,120
Rym: Hello, Scojo's email.

1301
01:06:16,781 --> 01:06:23,980
Scott: And also, when friends try to bring files over to your house and you don't trust them, you can have them put all their files in the HDVC where, you know, you can quarantine them.

1302
01:06:24,442 --> 01:06:25,748
Scott: On the rest of your real computers.

1303
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:28,220
Scott: And your friends will never have to touch your real computer.

1304
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,506
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1305
01:06:36,566 --> 01:06:41,520
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1306
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,940
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1307
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,887
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1308
01:06:50,027 --> 01:06:54,620
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1309
01:06:54,981 --> 01:06:58,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1310
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,490
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1311
01:07:02,691 --> 01:07:05,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
