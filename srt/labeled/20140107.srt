1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,181
Rym: It's Tuesday, January 7th, 2014.

2
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:14,580
Scott: Oh my god, you got it right.

3
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:15,339
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:16,160
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,200
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,460
Rym: Scott, I think, was betting with himself on that.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,621
Rym: And tonight, we're talking about the games of MAGFest 11?

8
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,580
Scott: MAGFest 2014.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,540
Rym: The 11th MAGFest.

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,358
Scott: I think it might be more than the 11th MAGFest.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,539
Rym: Maybe the 12th MAGFest.

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,336
Rym: We went to 9, 10-- I don't know.

13
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:34,758
Scott: I think it may have been the 12th.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,000
Rym: The most recent MAGFest.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,727
Scott: 2014 MAGFest.

16
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,138
Scott: Let's do this.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,854
Rym: I'm almost relieved that we don't have any conventions until PAX East.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,239
Scott: You skipped my opening bit.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,240
Scott: You know what my opening bit is?

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,279
Rym: What was your opening bit?

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:46,709
Scott: Woman?

22
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:48,520
Rym: It's warm today.

23
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,240
Scott: It's a little bit warm today.

24
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,099
Scott: We didn't do anything nice.

25
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,379
Scott: Only relatively speaking.

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,199
Rym: Now, I just want to point out that it wasn't that cold in New York.

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,400
Scott: Compared to other places, it wasn't as cold in New York.

28
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,280
Scott: It was still fucking cold.

29
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,520
Rym: But it was not below zero Fahrenheit, because growing up in Detroit-- It came close.

30
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,918
Scott: We were in the single digits Fahrenheit.

31
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:10,679
Rym: We hit four.

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,118
Rym: You know what?

33
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:13,999
Rym: I will admit that four is pretty nippy.

34
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:16,140
Scott: Only pretty nippy?

35
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,100
Rym: Well, it was funny.

36
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:18,700
Scott: It's ridiculously cold.

37
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:21,071
Rym: So I did not-- my life, I think about these things.

38
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,176
Rym: You have hair.

39
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:24,099
Rym: I do.

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,579
Rym: Hair that I wash in the morning so it gets wet.

41
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,119
Scott: Dry it before you go outside.

42
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,160
Rym: That takes too long.

43
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,699
Rym: You know what I did?

44
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,399
Rym: I did not wash my hair in the morning for three days.

45
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:35,060
Scott: Hair makes a big difference.

46
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,000
Scott: I was really cold.

47
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:36,659
Rym: Also hats.

48
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:42,260
Rym: So when I walked outside, one, I didn't get my hair wet, because a group in Michigan went to school in Rochester.

49
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,200
Rym: I've experienced frozen head hair.

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,040
Rym: It's not pleasant.

51
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:49,279
Rym: I get down to the street, and I start walking toward the subway, and there's a cop.

52
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,500
Rym: And he stops a guy who's walking out of his apartment.

53
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:55,279
Rym: And he's like, yo, dog, you should put on a hat.

54
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:57,220
Rym: And the guy's like, what?

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,459
Rym: It's not that cold.

56
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:02,059
Rym: Then he kind of pauses, and the cop's like, you're going to get frostbite.

57
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,540
Rym: And the guy's like, yeah, and he goes back inside.

58
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:09,120
Rym: But there were actually cops going around telling people.

59
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:16,240
Rym: That was the thing I saw people tweeting about, to put on hats, because it was cold enough to get frostbite if you live too far from the subway.

60
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:17,318
Scott: I did not witness that.

61
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,080
Rym: Maybe it was just your neighborhood?

62
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:19,516
Rym: I don't know.

63
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:23,358
Rym: There's a lot more cops in my neighborhood, because there's that bridge thing right there.

64
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,294
Rym: Like, there's the cop every day.

65
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,340
Scott: Forcing people-- No, the traffic cops.

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,800
Rym: Yeah, but they talk to people.

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,575
Rym: Like, they hang out.

68
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,879
Scott: When I bike in the summer, past traffic cops and crossing guards, they talk to you.

69
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:34,494
Scott: They try to.

70
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:36,839
Rym: Try to?

71
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,459
Rym: I imagine, yo, asshole, you're the-- hey, you can't go there.

72
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:41,956
Scott: Something like that.

73
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:43,920
Rym: So yeah, we're back.

74
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:44,340
Rym: We're bad.

75
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,398
Rym: I don't expect there'll be that many interruptions to GeekNights for a few months.

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,798
Scott: PAX East.

77
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,140
Rym: PAX East is in April?

78
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,859
Scott: I thought it was March.

79
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:52,699
Rym: I don't remember.

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,920
Rym: So why-- it's a ways out.

81
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,699
Scott: Anime Boston.

82
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,978
Rym: Anime Boston, still got to submit panels to.

83
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,160
Rym: What else?

84
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,777
Rym: What other cons?

85
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,120
Rym: PAX Prime, I guess.

86
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,739
Scott: When's Zenkai Con?

87
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:04,520
Rym: Sometime in the summer.

88
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,038
Rym: I don't know.

89
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,880
Rym: We're committed to going.

90
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,658
Scott: Are we?

91
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,316
Rym: No, yeah.

92
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,239
Rym: We're doing like four panels.

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,659
Scott: I see a bucket.

94
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:12,980
Scott: Well, I don't see a bucket.

95
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,157
Scott: I see a pail and a word that rhymes with it.

96
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:19,580
Rym: We also-- oh, it's this weekend, maybe?

97
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,071
Rym: I don't know.

98
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:25,477
Scott: Not doing anything this weekend except watching footballs and maybe baking some breads.

99
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:28,000
Rym: You want to do some video or some game streaming?

100
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,580
Scott: Does it involve football or warm bread?

101
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:32,460
Rym: I don't know.

102
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,598
Rym: People really-- the antenna videos are starting to get some views.

103
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:35,118
Scott: Oh, yeah.

104
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:35,799
Scott: We should do that.

105
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:36,700
Scott: But it's cold.

106
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,400
Rym: It's going to be like 50 fucking degrees this weekend.

107
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,417
Scott: It's going to rain.

108
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,100
Scott: It's going to rain.

109
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:42,978
Rym: It is.

110
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,260
Rym: I'm going to bike on Saturday.

111
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,000
Rym: Fuck y'all.

112
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,580
Scott: I saw a dude biking this morning.

113
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:54,900
Rym: Scott, two days ago, I was walking home wearing my heaviest jacket thinking to myself, fuck, fuck, walk real slow.

114
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,219
Rym: Don't let the cold air in.

115
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,039
Rym: I saw a dude wearing tights and a ski jacket running.

116
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:01,380
Scott: Yeah, I see people running a lot.

117
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:02,200
Scott: Running is one thing.

118
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:03,438
Rym: It was six degrees.

119
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,538
Scott: Running heats you up.

120
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,700
Scott: Biking, it's like when you just-- it's like there's a fan blowing on you.

121
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:09,019
Scott: You're creating your own wind chill.

122
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,960
Rym: So Scott, I know you don't ski, but I'll say one thing.

123
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,639
Rym: When I go skiing-- Same shit happens?

124
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,139
Rym: So the temperature on the ground in the wind during the cold snap in New York was about the temperature I experienced on top of the mountains.

125
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,779
Scott: Oh, another reason not to ski.

126
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,055
Scott: Cool.

127
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,398
Rym: So the problem is you get to the top of the mountain and it's that cold and it's windy.

128
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:29,360
Rym: So you start skiing and your face starts to freeze.

129
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,880
Scott: But then you're going down the mountain.

130
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,419
Scott: It's getting warmer.

131
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,279
Rym: So as you're going down, you're getting warmer.

132
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,560
Rym: And you're exerting yourself.

133
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,517
Rym: So by the bottom, you're so hot you want to take your coat off.

134
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:40,779
Rym: Anyway, we're back.

135
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:41,659
Rym: All that stuff.

136
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:43,860
Rym: So I got a Geek Bite.

137
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,679
Rym: I don't know if you have any news or anything.

138
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,278
Scott: I have news.

139
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:49,200
Rym: There's a lot of news, but I'll do my Geek Bite really quick.

140
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,840
Rym: I played The Stanley Parable.

141
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:55,520
Rym: I don't think it's really worth doing a whole show on unless we do a broader topic about that kind of game.

142
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,939
Scott: I played the demo.

143
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,220
Scott: That's the one where you walk around the hallways in the Half-Life engine and it just the guy tells you what to do.

144
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,080
Rym: Yeah, so fuck the demo.

145
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,800
Rym: Play the full game.

146
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,479
Rym: It added a lot and really, really polished it.

147
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:08,800
Scott: Yeah, I played it a long time ago and then it's ignored.

148
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,200
Rym: If I had to summarize this game, and Scott can talk about it because he played the demo, this is just more than the demo.

149
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,340
Scott: It's like Bastion, the FPS, without the action.

150
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,940
Rym: You know what it is?

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,079
Rym: It's what Elevator Source should have been.

152
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,340
Rym: It's the same kind of game as Elevator Source.

153
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,140
Scott: It's an experience.

154
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:25,499
Scott: It's a game.

155
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,660
Scott: It's an entertainment software?

156
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,840
Rym: Yes, interactive amusement.

157
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,340
Rym: I would argue that it fits into our definition of ideal game.

158
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:37,499
Rym: Because you play through the game and your decisions affect your personal outcome.

159
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,499
Rym: Play the game again.

160
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,780
Rym: Different decisions make a different outcome.

161
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,299
Scott: This is only a limited set of outcomes.

162
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:44,039
Rym: Yeah, all games have a limited set of outcomes.

163
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:46,119
Rym: The universe has quanta.

164
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,060
Scott: NetHack has an effectively infinite set of outcomes, as does Dwarf Wars.

165
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,420
Rym: But it is technically limited.

166
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:53,440
Scott: Technically.

167
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,220
Rym: There is a limit.

168
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,620
Rym: The Stanley Parable, Scott, the new version, has more outcomes than you would expect.

169
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:00,380
Rym: And they're subtle.

170
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,140
Scott: Does it have more than Chrono Trigger?

171
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,040
Rym: I'll put it this way.

172
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,060
Rym: I played it for two hours, and I saw all the outcomes I cared to, and at no point did anything repeat.

173
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:22,159
Rym: And what amazed me about this game, or I guess what surprised me, I shouldn't say amazed, is the number and variety of ways the narrator would react to things I did that I did not expect him to react to.

174
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:27,680
Rym: And also the fact that in the kind of remade game, there's a very ominous feeling.

175
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,540
Rym: Like, the game almost feels sinister.

176
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,380
Scott: It felt sinister when I played it originally.

177
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,699
Rym: The directions you take and where you go.

178
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,759
Rym: I don't want to spoil it at all, but it's a game that everyone should experience.

179
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,900
Rym: It is an interactive amusement that is highly amusing.

180
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:49,779
Rym: And the moment that got me, as I walk around, and I'm doing stuff, and basically just this game, you get this experience, and you're walking, and eventually there's a choice.

181
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,397
Rym: There's two doors, and the narrator is kind of describing, "Stanley got up and walked around, "and Stanley decided to go into the door on the

182
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:57,820
Rym: left.".

183
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,199
Scott: - And you don't have to go in the door on the left.

184
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,800
Rym: - And I go into the door on the right, and things go off the rails.

185
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,100
Scott: - Well, just go in the door on the left.

186
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,218
Rym: - Yeah, and if you do that, it's just that.

187
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,200
Rym: So, what surprised me was how reactive the moderator was to me.

188
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,800
Rym: Like, at one point, I walked into a place, and I'm just kind of hanging out in there, looking around, and then the narrator's like, "There's really nothing to do in this room.

189
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,671
Rym: "Stanley really should just get on with his

190
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:20,994
Rym: journey.".

191
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:22,400
Rym: Really?

192
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,898
Rym: You're going to stay in that room?

193
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:25,020
Rym: Well, fine.

194
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:26,439
Rym: Stuff happens.

195
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:34,299
Rym: So, I got to a point where there's a room, and there's a phone, and it's ringing, and it's like, "Stanley was about to embark "on the great journey,".

196
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,739
Rym: and then I understand this long thing.

197
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:43,500
Rym: So, I see there's a cord, so I run around the room, just click on everything, and I click on the cord, and it just unplugs the phone, and it stops ringing, and then the narrator's like, "Really?

198
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,534
Rym: "Really?

199
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:45,865
Rym: "Well,

200
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:46,112
Rym: fuck.".

201
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:48,020
Rym: It's really funny.

202
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,719
Rym: It is as funny as Portal, but there isn't a, there's no skill game in there.

203
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:55,359
Rym: It's Portal without the game part, but with the other game part.

204
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,898
Rym: Because gaming's a lot of things.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,640
Scott: - These people who make these things should stop making entertainment softwares and should just make amusement park places.

206
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,520
Scott: They should just become, what's it called at Disney?

207
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,160
Scott: What's that job?

208
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,259
Rym: - Well, this is that.

209
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,220
Scott: - Imagineers?

210
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,680
Rym: - In fact, if you took, you could make the Stanley Parable.

211
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,620
Scott: - They should just become Imagineers and quit their video game making ways.

212
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,420
Rym: - Now, here's the thing.

213
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,020
Rym: You could not fully make the Stanley Parable.

214
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,498
Scott: - Or, Imagineers should make entertainment softwares just like this.

215
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:26,020
Rym: - The problem with making the Stanley Parable in the real world is that it uses non-Euclidean geometry heavily.

216
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,720
Rym: There's a lot of places where you'll walk around.

217
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,499
Scott: - So does the Haunted High Mansion, so.

218
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,320
Rym: - But it's just, it's tricking you with mirrors and things.

219
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,880
Rym: It's not actually non-Euclidean.

220
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,000
Rym: This is an actually non-Euclidean space.

221
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,000
Scott: - There's plenty of those, every amusement park ride nowadays is just four 3D screens surrounding you anyway.

222
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,160
Rym: - Yeah, you could do it that way, but that's, the Stanley Parable, I laughed out loud a bunch of times.

223
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,340
Rym: It is super fun.

224
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,919
Rym: It is well worth interacting with this thing, this ideal game, this interactive series of decisions that gives you a personal outcome that you can repeat.

225
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:04,159
Rym: And once you've played through and you think you're done, go on YouTube and find the endings you didn't find in the game.

226
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,780
Rym: Don't try to save that fucking baby.

227
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,757
Rym: It's not worth it.

228
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,020
Scott: - So here's the news, right?

229
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,334
Scott: Apparently there was a dude we never heard of until now, named Greg Martin, and he died.

230
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:22,439
Scott: So I wanna give him some extra recognitions 'cause I saw this on the internet, but I didn't see it on enough internet.

231
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,417
Scott: He's one of those guys--.

232
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,480
Rym: - Rockin' gospel blues?

233
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,114
Scott: - No.

234
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,220
Scott: One of those--.

235
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,160
Rym: - That's a football player, rugby player?

236
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,497
Rym: - No.

237
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,747
Rym: - Okay, if you like Greg Martin, I'm finding a lot of Greg Martins that aren't your Greg Martin.

238
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:34,000
Scott: - That's a common name, okay?

239
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:43,399
Scott: He's one of those people that did something really important that you know, but he was unheralded and unrecognized for his great works.

240
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:50,259
Scott: And you know, it's like, well, we should recognize his great works, even though we are too late.

241
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,719
Rym: - Is it this DeviantArt guy?

242
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:52,714
Scott: - No.

243
00:09:55,061 --> 00:10:02,440
Scott: He is the guy who did lots and lots of video game box art in your childhood, and you didn't even realize.

244
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:15,880
Scott: For example, Little Nemo Dream Master NES, Pac-Man Game Boy, Snow Brothers NES, Adventure Island Game Boy, Felix the Cat NES, Sonic 2.

245
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,560
Rym: - Oh man, Sonic 2.

246
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:27,300
Scott: - Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman, DuckTales 2, Flintstones, he did all the art for all these video game boxes.

247
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:41,416
Scott: Pac-Attack SNES, Tengen Pac-Man, NES Pac-Man, Sonic Spinball, a lot of Sonic box art, Bomberman's, Time Gal, Arrow the Acrobat, and there's a whole thread-- - Et cetera.

248
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:54,019
Scott: - Yeah, there's a whole thread here on Nintendo Age Forum that shows all his box arts, and once you see the box arts, you're like, that guy, all those boxes look the same, oh my God, that art.

249
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,860
Rym: - I guess we have to add to the Google juice so that he'll pop up over all these rugby players and things.

250
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,110
Scott: - Exactly, so yeah.

251
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:09,880
Scott: Now the thing is, what this makes me wanna do is not only to recognize and remember him and his great and memorable box art-- - But to figure out other people who do box art?

252
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:21,377
Scott: - To find other video game box art artists from back in the day, or we don't know the Atari guy, I forget his name, right, who did all the pitfalls and all those ones, and then the Breakout guy who did all those ones.

253
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:28,110
Scott: I actually saw, I think I saw a video of that guy doing the super Breakout live sketching or whatever, anyway.

254
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:41,480
Scott: Like yeah, there should be some more recognition of video game box artists from the '80s, '90s, early 2000s, not anyone who's doing it today, they can shove it, they just use their computer.

255
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:43,519
Scott: They can't.

256
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,240
Rym: - So things of the day.

257
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:56,400
Rym: This video is just kind of amazing and so enjoyable.

258
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,719
Rym: I can't, you just all need to watch it.

259
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,800
Rym: This is Story Wars.

260
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:03,738
Scott: It's an animation-- - Sure we didn't already do this?

261
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,699
Rym: - I couldn't find any example of us having done it.

262
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,600
Rym: I've searched multiple times in multiple venues.

263
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:25,320
Rym: So Story War, this is actually on cartoon hangover, and basically this is an animation of the kind of stories that come out of Story War, the game.

264
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:34,048
Rym: And it kind of makes, it's kind of an ad for Story War, but it's a really good ad because it's really funny and I really like the style.

265
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:37,895
Rym: and this is the kind of show that I would watch if it was a show.

266
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,031
Rym: In the being puppy cat, Dr.

267
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:48,439
Rym: Lollipop, bravest warriors, it's in that genre almost, but with a little twist of slayers.

268
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,960
Scott: - Definitely a twist of slayers.

269
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,740
Rym: - This thing is great and you need to watch it.

270
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,020
Scott: - Doesn't make me want to play the game though.

271
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:56,660
Rym: - I haven't actually played the game.

272
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:58,960
Scott: The thing is-- - I'd say it doesn't make me want to play the game.

273
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,399
Scott: - Every-- - I'm not saying the game is bad.

274
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,340
Rym: - Every game that makes stories that I've seen has not been as good as old nanofictionary.

275
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:05,940
Rym: No one talks about nanofictionary.

276
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,076
Scott: - Nanofictionary.

277
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,040
Rym: - Pretty sure we've done a show on nanofictionary.

278
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,253
Rym: - So good.

279
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,079
Rym: - But yeah, watch this thing, it's great.

280
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:14,320
Scott: - So, Space Dandy.

281
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,660
Rym: - Space Dandy.

282
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,400
Scott: - Is gonna save anime, or supposedly is gonna save anime.

283
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,480
Scott: Watch the first episode, not bad, not bad at all.

284
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,900
Rym: - Too late, Kill La Kill already saved anime.

285
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,798
Scott: - Sure, everything that saves anime is saving it with boobies.

286
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:29,920
Rym: But anyway.

287
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,520
Rym: - I love how as the opening, if that keeps going on, the boobies are just boobying and boobying more and more and more.

288
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,099
Scott: - So, you know, Japan gets all the video games we don't get.

289
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,619
Scott: And mostly we concentrate on the unreleased console games that Japan gets that we don't get.

290
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,534
Scott: Especially DS games, and mostly Nintendo games.

291
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,337
Rym: - Yeah.

292
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,180
Scott: - But, Japan actually gets tons and tons of mobile phone games that we never get here ever.

293
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:07,840
Scott: And no one seems to care about that at all, even though some of them are probably really awesome, especially if you care about licensed properties that are Japanese.

294
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,694
Scott: I'm sure there's plenty of crayon shin-chan phone games you could get that we don't have, right?

295
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,579
Scott: But, we're never gonna have 'em.

296
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,459
Scott: So, no elephant dance for us.

297
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:24,400
Scott: So, here's a commercial for one such game, Space Galaga.

298
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:26,890
Scott: Which is Space Dandy?

299
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:28,379
Scott: Galaga for your phone.

300
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,540
Rym: - It looks really stylish.

301
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,380
Scott: - Basically, it looks like Galaga for your phone, but Space Dandy, how come we don't have that here?

302
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:37,879
Scott: Hello?

303
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,020
Scott: This is why you guys in America-- - Well, Space Dandy did just come out.

304
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,140
Scott: - Right, but this is why you guys in America don't make money on the animes, 'cause you're trying to just make money on the animes.

305
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,380
Scott: You gotta bring out every single thing that's related to, that's just how the Japanese-- - More importantly, you've gotta bring it out right the fuck away.

306
00:14:53,080 --> 00:15:01,180
Scott: - I remember when Madoka Magica-- - That's how they're making money on Space Dandy in Japan, 'cause they're putting out phone games and toys and toothbrushes and the whole shitload, right?

307
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,464
Rym: - Even in the

308
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:01,525
Rym: U.S.,

309
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:04,399
Rym: remember way, way back when My Little Pony turned into the big thing?

310
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:09,659
Rym: It was a while before there were things to sell, so you know who makes money off of you?

311
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:17,780
Rym: If you try to make money off of a show and not of the merchandise, people who illegally bootleg stuff with your IP on it in artist alleys.

312
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,120
Scott: - Right, make the shit and bring the shit out immediately.

313
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,085
Scott: Meanwhile, Space Dandy, the first episode aired in the U.S.

314
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:28,080
Scott: first, but they got the Space Galaga already developed, already on their phones.

315
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:31,100
Scott: right the hell now, and people here don't even know that it exists.

316
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,779
Rym: - It's our roles.

317
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,455
Scott: - Yeah.

318
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:41,319
Rym: - So, in the meta moment, thank you all who came to MagFest and the four panels that Scott and I were on, especially the people who showed up at 10 fucking a.m.

319
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:42,860
Rym: for our bad games panel.

320
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,419
Scott: - Seriously, why would you do that?

321
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,640
Rym: - Also, that mage's room was kind of in the back, and on the map, we're like, oh shit, is this tiny fucking room in the middle of nowhere?

322
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:50,863
Rym: But no.

323
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,739
Scott: - It wasn't that tiny.

324
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,140
Rym: - The room was pretty big, and it actually was rocking the entire con.

325
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,278
Scott: - Yeah, people were into it.

326
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:00,218
Scott: It seemed like there were certain people, like that's what they were there for.

327
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,680
Scott: Which was interesting.

328
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,880
Rym: - Notice how the panel attendance has really gone up as they've pushed the academic stuff over the media, guests.

329
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,919
Scott: - Super Art Fight was in a bigger room, and it was really crowded in there.

330
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,640
Rym: - Yeah, MagFest is on the upswing, but I think MagFest is gonna have a cap next year, because-- - We'll see what happens.

331
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,599
Rym: - We'll see what happens.

332
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:22,120
Rym: So MagFest, you were great, everyone who came to see us at MagFest, you were great.

333
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:27,880
Rym: If you wanted to play a game with us, we didn't play a game with you, I'm sorry, I was drunk and wandering around a lot.

334
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:30,718
Rym: I might have said, "Yeah, I'll see you

335
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:30,960
Rym: later.".

336
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,460
Rym: I was probably drunk and I don't remember.

337
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,579
Rym: Also, hot tub party.

338
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:37,488
Scott: So, yeah.

339
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:38,880
Scott: - Any other meta things?

340
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,818
Rym: - The Book Club book is and was.

341
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,788
Rym: - I do.

342
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:42,620
Rym: - I do, we're done with it.

343
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,220
Scott: - I finished reading it like yesterday.

344
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,938
Rym: - Finally, I read two full books since I finished it.

345
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,600
Scott: - All right, we'll see.

346
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:50,079
Rym: - Two more Ian M. Banks books.

347
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,671
Scott: - Oh, okay.

348
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:51,711
Scott: -

349
00:16:51,792 --> 00:17:06,535
Rym: Yeah, so I might, I almost want to make the next Book Club book that wool book that listeners keep giving us copies of, and then we got more copies of at that charity dinner we went to at PAX Prime, because today, the CTO of my company is like, "Oh, hey, we're in,

350
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:06,757
Rym: Bob.".

351
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:13,720
Rym: So there's a book, and I know you really like good sci-fi, that I just read, and it's great, and it was that book.

352
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,307
Rym: - It was wool?

353
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,140
Rym: - Yeah, it was wool.

354
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,711
Scott: - Is it about sheep?

355
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:17,459
Scott: - I don't know.

356
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,839
Scott: - Are androids dreaming of them?

357
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,939
Rym: - I don't know, I've got five physical copies of it, because people keep giving them to me.

358
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:25,920
Rym: One of them is signed by the author.

359
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:26,762
Scott: - Okay.

360
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:31,140
Rym: - So I guess, I don't know, I might make some dry history of my book instead.

361
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:39,979
Scott: - At work, they gave away free copies of Fosse, if you want, which is pretty sure is a biography or something, it's a giant book, I could make that a Book Club book.

362
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,345
Scott: - No.

363
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,620
Scott: - I didn't even take my free copy, because who the hell wants it?

364
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:50,440
Rym: - A company I do business with in Turkey gave me, as a gift, this huge, gigantic history book of a particular city in the old Roman Empire.

365
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,618
Scott: - They know that much history, huh?

366
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,460
Rym: - That book looks really, really good.

367
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:04,774
Rym: And also, Emily's mom gave me a book that is titled Strategy, and so far, it is the kind of book that Scott and I will love and you will all hate.

368
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:05,440
Rym: - Okay.

369
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,580
Rym: - It is, take Characteristics of Games and go way more academic and way more historical.

370
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,100
Rym: It's up our alley, it's also really fucking thick.

371
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,805
Scott: - All right.

372
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:20,360
Rym: - Join our forum, it's awesome, it's rocking again, now that the holidays are over.

373
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,680
Scott: - Think about everything that there is on the internet, every protocol on the internet for communicating, right?

374
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,979
Scott: That you can think of, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, social networks, IRCs, forums.

375
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,158
Rym: - Gopher, what about gopher?

376
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:32,826
Rym: Gopher.

377
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:33,500
Rym: - Not gopher.

378
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,488
Rym: - Gopher, no gopher.

379
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:38,720
Scott: - All right, websites, everything that you, YouTubes, everything.

380
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,700
Scott: We are there, come and find us in those places.

381
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,419
Rym: - We're not on BitTorrent anymore.

382
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,388
Rym: - Steam groups.

383
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:47,578
Rym: - Those old torrents stopped working a long time ago.

384
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,006
Rym: - Right, I mean.

385
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:48,964
Rym: - If you can even find the trackers.

386
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:51,698
Scott: - You can email us, geekknights@frontrecruit.com.

387
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:54,155
Scott: There are so many ways.

388
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:54,820
Rym: - Actually, a listener.

389
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,090
Scott: - To communicate with us and the other people who listen to this show.

390
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,120
Rym: - I have not looked at it yet.

391
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,240
Scott: - You have to take advantage of at least some of them.

392
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,779
Rym: - I have not looked at it yet, a listener sent us a video question once I watched it.

393
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:11,932
Scott: - I watched it, it's the guy from Australia, who is, I already emailed, I answered him in YouTube, but I'll address it anyway.

394
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:14,220
Rym: - Well, I didn't watch the video yet, so you can't, no spoilers.

395
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,700
Scott: - This is a Tuesday show, right?

396
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,715
Scott: - Yeah, no spoilers.

397
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:17,852
Scott: - All right, so it's game related.

398
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:19,549
Rym: - I was gonna do a video answer.

399
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:26,548
Scott: - No, so remember-- in Australia, and we played Blockus and Hanabi-- - Oh, it's the smart couple.

400
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,039
Scott: - Right, yeah, so--.

401
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,126
Rym: - They were really smart.

402
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:34,660
Scott: - The dude, his name's Bane, I guess it's his real name, which is fuckin' awesome, his real name's Bane, hell yeah.

403
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,378
Scott: - Hello, Batman.

404
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,999
Rym: You haven't even seen that movie, you don't know what I'm referencing.

405
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,620
Scott: - I know who Bane is, though, 'cause I watched Batman the Animated Series.

406
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,040
Rym: - Do you know his funny voice?

407
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,748
Rym: I don't--.

408
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,812
Scott: - I thought he talks like the way in the South Park episode, with the--.

409
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:51,045
Rym: - It's hard to describe his accent.

410
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,417
Scott: - You're talking more like Inspector Gadget.

411
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,659
Rym: - That would be, move the clown to the other button.

412
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,754
Rym: - That's what you're doing, right.

413
00:19:58,621 --> 00:19:59,700
Scott: You're not doing a Bane voice.

414
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:10,440
Scott: Anyway, so he made a, he didn't need to make a video to ask this question, basically the question he was asking is, his partner, right, they're playing more games now, since, you know, PAXOS, right?

415
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,450
Scott: More better games.

416
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,117
Rym: - Ooh, steppin' it up.

417
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:20,080
Scott: - But, the games they play, the game he was using, an example is a game called Cuba that we never played, but we don't need to know how to play it.

418
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:39,140
Scott: In Cuba, sometimes, 'cause it's a game, right, you can make a move where you'll get four points, or you can make a move where you'll get three points, but other people might lose points, right, so it's like, you know, and basically, his partner doesn't like games where you attack people.

419
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,671
Rym: - Welcome to the world of direct fucking, AKA highly political.

420
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:46,959
Scott: - So my answer was, I don't know how to change a person's personality, sorry.

421
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:47,896
Scott: The end.

422
00:20:48,620 --> 00:21:02,280
Rym: - The real answer is, if you want to play competitive games and want to get good at them, you have to either only play two player games, or be able to accept that you will lose due to politics.

423
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:08,820
Scott: - No, but it's like, he wants to know how to make her accept that she will lose to politics, and I was like, she won't.

424
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,119
Rym: - I was talking at her, not you.

425
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,528
Rym: I remember our friend Luke, not Luke Crane, different Luke, way back, when we were first getting into German board games.

426
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:16,240
Scott: - But he was the one asking.

427
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,940
Rym: - Yeah, well I'm saying we started playing El Grande.

428
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,959
Rym: Like, that was our first real, real German board game after, like, Settlers and Carcassonne.

429
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:26,320
Rym: Like, that was the first, like, wooden cubes game.

430
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,439
Rym: That's where we went, like, full on after that.

431
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:31,940
Rym: And I remember, there was a moment when I had this realization.

432
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:40,760
Rym: I was playing the game, and I realized, wait a minute, I can do this and get three points, or I can do this, get two points, and deny Luke four points.

433
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:53,960
Rym: Luke is winning by one point, and can get two points on his turn, and I did all the math, and I did the series of actions that was guaranteed to win me the game, and he got really fucking pissed.

434
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,280
Scott: - Right, there's no way to change that person.

435
00:21:57,221 --> 00:22:08,520
Scott: If you are that person, maybe you can change yourself, but as being another person, if you are not that person who is upset at people hurting each other in games, then you can't change someone else's personality.

436
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,719
Rym: You just have to-- - You know how I've gotten around that?

437
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,178
Scott: Play two-player games, because-- - Or don't play with, yeah, but he wants to play the multiplayer games.

438
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,059
Rym: - No, no, you've got to get someone to be able to play those games.

439
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:27,679
Rym: You have to get that person to play two-player games a lot, where there is no difference between getting three points or getting two points and denying one point.

440
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:44,900
Rym: So that will, if you play two-player games a lot, that have direct attacks and aren't just races, and you have that differential, that is the most intuitive way to make it clear that hurting someone else is the same as helping yourself, and you cannot discriminate between the two.

441
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,640
Rym: They're identical.

442
00:22:46,580 --> 00:23:00,219
Scott: - I don't, it's just, I think people, some people have a personality such that, where if someone's points go down, theirs or another's, right, it's like they don't want to see anyone harmed, even within the context of a game where no one's actually being harmed.

443
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,420
Scott: It's like that just upsets them, that there is harm, whether they caused it or someone else caused it.

444
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:13,780
Scott: - But I guess I've seen people-- And they just, those people, I've never seen a person who was that kind of person that didn't like that come around and become a person who likes it.

445
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,520
Rym: - Many of our friends who are women have had that problem in the past.

446
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Scott: - I think most people have this problem, actually.

447
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:25,040
Scott: Regardless of gender.

448
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:42,139
Rym: - But I have seen people get over it, and the best way I can think of, 'cause I don't have a shared way, just based on my experience, if you want any chance at all, you have to play two-player games where both things happen, and that is the only way to reinforce viscerally that, oh, these are the same thing.

449
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,760
Scott: Or-- - I think some people just don't, they have a higher priority than winning.

450
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,859
Scott: They don't care, right?

451
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,757
Scott: - Or, or, or!

452
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,480
Scott: - They just can't make them care about winning as much as--.

453
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,079
Rym: - Here's the other way.

454
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,618
Rym: Play a game like Bonanza.

455
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:56,660
Scott: Because Bonanza is-- - The fucking is concealed?

456
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:12,180
Rym: - Well, it's extremely political, but it's so interactive that it sort of glosses over the fact that it's actually extremely political, and that could also-- - People don't know that they've been harmed, 'cause it's not obvious that you lose 10 points.

457
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:19,039
Rym: - But eventually, if they keep playing, they might start to notice, or start to not notice when it happens more directly in more complex games.

458
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:34,460
Scott: - Another thing is, if you're a game designer, right, and you notice that certain people get upset when someone loses a victory point, you could just renumber your game such that, let's say there's a move I could do where I get five and Rym loses one.

459
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:40,180
Scott: You could just change it so that in that situation, I get six and Rym gets zero, 'cause it's effectively no different.

460
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,420
Rym: - That is complex with multiplayer games.

461
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:50,700
Scott: - Of course, but if you could somehow do, you know, rejigger the mathematics of your game to do that, then no one would get upset because no one's losing points.

462
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:57,340
Rym: - I think they would still get upset because they would start to perceive the direct actions that get a lot of points as being unfair.

463
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,440
Scott: - Yeah, maybe.

464
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,719
Rym: - They would, in fact, I think it would cause almost the same effect.

465
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,340
Scott: - Maybe, but I think there's just something about losing something, right, having your shit messed up.

466
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,280
Rym: - Yeah, well, case in point, you've all gotten zars before.

467
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:11,280
Rym: That's the worst thing in the fucking world.

468
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,518
Scott: - Mario Party the zar.

469
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,579
Rym: - Oh my God, remember the double zar that fucked us in the tournament, lost us the belt?

470
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,210
Rym: - That's right.

471
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:17,560
Rym: - That happens.

472
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,678
Scott: - It happens, okay.

473
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,820
Scott: Let's talk about games we played at MAGFest.

474
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,420
Rym: - All right, MAGFest was four days of gaming, not gonna talk about every game we played.

475
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,339
Rym: - Were you not there?

476
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:28,999
Scott: Why weren't you there?

477
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,608
Rym: - Yeah, seriously.

478
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,138
Rym: - You must suck.

479
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,758
Rym: - Listen, I understand--.

480
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,460
Scott: - There's no other explanation for not being there.

481
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,520
Rym: - I understand if you don't fly from America to PAX Australia.

482
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,260
Scott: - I understand if you don't fly from Mozambique to MAGFest.

483
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,091
Rym: That is acceptable.

484
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:45,520
Rym: - I understand if you don't fly to PAX Prime 'cause you don't live on the West Coast.

485
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,820
Scott: - Well, if you don't have tickets, right, it's understandable.

486
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,968
Rym: - Yeah, I understand if you don't go to PAX East 'cause it's sold out.

487
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:50,879
Rym: - MAGFest is not sold out.

488
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,930
Rym: - MAGFest had no cap.

489
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:54,760
Scott: - And it's four days and it's New Year's, you're on vacation anyway.

490
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:57,571
Scott: And it's not that crowded.

491
00:25:57,592 --> 00:26:00,675
Rym: - MAGFest is the best non-Pax convention ever.

492
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:01,440
Scott: - Period.

493
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:03,780
Rym: - So, MAGFest was awesome.

494
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,799
Rym: We played a lot of games, played a lot of Dig Dug.

495
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,340
Scott: Scott and I were neck and neck on this one machine, but then-- - It only keeps the top five scores and some other dude comes and blows us out of the water.

496
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:14,720
Scott: so we don't know what our scores are.

497
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,759
Rym: - All right, D_T, you had two orders of magnitude higher score than me.

498
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,140
Scott: - I don't know what the hell he's doing.

499
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,627
Scott: - Winning.

500
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,252
Scott: - I'm gonna go practice me some Dig Dug.

501
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:24,389
Rym: - I'm gonna practice some fucking Dig Dug.

502
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:28,060
Scott: - That's some bullshit because I said I was gonna practice Mike Tyson's punch shot, I didn't do that either.

503
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,536
Rym: - Yeah, I did some of the challenges and it was fun.

504
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:32,360
Rym: I played a lot of Dig Dug.

505
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,580
Rym: I played a lot of that weird eyes game that's like Pac-Man was shooting.

506
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,104
Scott: - What?

507
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,139
Rym: - You didn't see that?

508
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,564
Rym: - No.

509
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:40,599
Rym: - You're a floating eyeball on a Pac-Man board.

510
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,758
Rym: There's pills to pick up and you pick them up by shooting them.

511
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:44,320
Rym: There's other eyes flying around.

512
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,419
Rym: If they see you, they shoot at you and you can shoot them.

513
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,599
Rym: You pick up the things by shooting at them.

514
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:50,400
Rym: If the other eyes shoot you, you die.

515
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:56,199
Rym: It's really hard because if there's pills between you and the eye, you shoot at it, you hit the pill, its beam hits you.

516
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,264
Scott: - I played Magical Drop 3.

517
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:00,919
Scott: There were a lot of Magical Drop people there.

518
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,558
Scott: You know what else?

519
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,459
Rym: - The same motherfuckers around the initial D machine the entire con, I didn't even bother.

520
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,537
Scott: - You know what else?

521
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,820
Scott: Apparently, there's a game called Windjammers which is sort of like Frisbee volleyball, Frisbee tennis.

522
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:13,939
Scott: It's for Neo Geo.

523
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,919
Scott: So the Magical Drop machine was frequently a Windjammers machine 'cause it's Neo Geo, right?

524
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:29,538
Scott: But, Giant Bomb, that podcast video show we don't watch and whatever, but we know exists, they have made Windjammers ridiculously popular for some reason.

525
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,900
Scott: So during MAGFest, all these bros are playing Windjammers like crazy and I was like, what the fuck?

526
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,179
Scott: Get away from my Magical Drops.

527
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,360
Scott: We wanna drop some magic balls on your heads.

528
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,157
Scott: Stop throwing the discs.

529
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
Rym: - We never got, there was an Araki table.

530
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:43,940
Rym: we never got a chance to use.

531
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,259
Rym: - Justice.

532
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,880
Rym: - There was an Artemis Space Bridge that Emily and a bunch of our friends played.

533
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,658
Scott: - Yep.

534
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:50,420
Rym: - They got nuked and had some trouble.

535
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:53,418
Rym: I think we're gonna play some of that in the near future with our crew.

536
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:59,539
Rym: But the games we played that we wanna talk about are the tabletop games.

537
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,278
Scott: - That's right.

538
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,580
Rym: - 'Cause there really aren't new console games that we haven't already talked about.

539
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,680
Scott: - So there's one game, the big one, right?

540
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,959
Scott: It's one that I've heard about for many moons but I've never had a chance to play.

541
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:11,980
Scott: but I've heard it oftenly spoke.

542
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:17,299
Scott: It is maybe one of the highest ranking board game geek games I haven't played or, you know, and--.

543
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,580
Rym: - Yeah, it's also a hundred fucking dollars on Amazon.

544
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,760
Scott: - Right, the game is called Hansa to Tonica.

545
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,440
Rym: - So if I had to analogize it after looking at it and learning the rules, wrong twice.

546
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:31,460
Rym: We'll get to that.

547
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,520
Scott: - Talk about getting rules wrong.

548
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,776
Scott: This is the worst case of wrong rule ever, ever.

549
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:47,376
Rym: - I like the point that there were multiple people in one game who were all playing on a radically different assumption because different other sets of people who weren't playing told them wrong.

550
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:49,540
Scott: And all of those people were wrong.

551
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,719
Scott: - One person read the rules, another person super read the rules, right?

552
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,079
Scott: Y'all got it wrong.

553
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,680
Rym: - The game feels a lot like some aspects of Thurn in Texas, some aspects of Web of Power.

554
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,660
Scott: - See, the thing is those are games that I am A+ at and those aspects I did not have in this game.

555
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,280
Scott: - Yeah, this game-- - Partially because of wrong rule.

556
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:22,439
Rym: - Has extremely obscured positional heuristics to the point that it is almost impossible for a novice player to have any concept of how well they're doing until the game ends.

557
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,740
Rym: And they will also not likely see the end of the game approaching.

558
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:28,420
Scott: - Nope, unless it's the victory point kind.

559
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,519
Scott: That one's easy to see.

560
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:35,780
Rym: - Yeah, but even then they might not notice because the victory points seem to not get to that point usually.

561
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:44,520
Scott: - Basically what it is, it's a game where you're basically putting guys on roads similar to Ticket to Ride, but you have to sort of fight to control the roads and some roads are better than others.

562
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,399
Rym: - But controlling a road means you pick up all your guys and then interact with one of the end points of the road.

563
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,060
Scott: - Finishing a road allows you to put a real guy on the board, which is hard, right?

564
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:56,160
Scott: And then the real guys, it would actually matter.

565
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,015
Rym: - But they're limited power grid style in where they can go.

566
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:06,740
Rym: There's multiple kinds of guys and the places they can interact with not only are limited but are radically different.

567
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:10,000
Rym: Like you put a guy in one spot and you control the office.

568
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,999
Rym: You'll get victory points when other people will finish routes that touch that.

569
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:22,318
Rym: Or you can put it on the action thing and then like get more actions, get more workers to place later, or upgrade your bag or upgrade all these things you've got on your little thingy.

570
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,279
Scott: - But really what makes it hard to figure out is the side effects.

571
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,360
Scott: It's like upgrading the book, for example, right?

572
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:32,800
Scott: So if you build a road in a certain place you can upgrade your book, right?

573
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:38,898
Scott: Okay, if you upgrade your book then when you use the airlift action you can airlift more dudes.

574
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:44,538
Scott: But at the same time you also get another merchant 'cause you upgraded your book.

575
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:57,240
Scott: So it's like all these, when you do something it actually has like crazy side effects all over the place and certain things you need really badly that go with other things you don't need so badly and vice versa all over the place.

576
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:02,740
Scott: So there isn't like this clear path of do these things in this order for optimal efficiency.

577
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,479
Scott: It's like, oh I can just go get more, everyone is trying to get more actions 'cause that was so obviously good.

578
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:16,180
Scott: But it's like, wait a minute, if I upgrade my bag that's effectively getting more actions 'cause I'll have to take less bag actions and can do more non-bag actions.

579
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,980
Rym: - But in the game I played--.

580
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,220
Scott: - 'Cause my bag is more efficient.

581
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,860
Rym: - Because of counter attacks I was able to do what I wanted with almost no bagging at any point.

582
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:34,880
Rym: So the game is very reactive in that you can put your guys out on the road but if you have guys out that haven't finished a road other people can spend more guys to displace your guys.

583
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:37,680
Rym: but then you get kinda like double guys.

584
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,840
Rym: So if I displace one of Scott's guys he gets to put two guys on a nearby road.

585
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,140
Scott: - Then I can use the airlift to just move the guys that I've now gotten free extra guys.

586
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:56,460
Rym: - So you see this strategy where people will put a guy in the way of someone else hoping to get displaced and that person might then not displace them because it would displace them somewhere that would fuck up their shit elsewhere.

587
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,279
Scott: - And now your guys are all trapped and shit.

588
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,820
Rym: - Yeah or--.

589
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,800
Scott: - 'Cause they're just hanging out there not being displaced.

590
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,259
Rym: - Or you displace, someone else displace, you have a displaced cascade over multiple rounds because people are getting all these guys on the board from being displaced.

591
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:18,600
Rym: The board can change so radically between one turn and the next that you gotta rethink your whole strategy but the actions you take are extremely simple.

592
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,840
Scott: - Yeah there's only what, five actions you can take?

593
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,440
Scott: Bag, put guys, airlift guys, claim and something else?

594
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,899
Rym: - Something like that.

595
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,120
Scott: - Yeah and then on your turn you get what, two actions?

596
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,299
Rym: - I only played it once.

597
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,020
Rym: I gotta read the rules in detail.

598
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,000
Scott: - It's a game I definitely wanna play again but I think it has a lot of long-term play possibilities.

599
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,293
Scott: - Yes.

600
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,700
Scott: - But I think Tammany Hall, I wanna play again more.

601
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,720
Rym: - I wanna play that too.

602
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,120
Scott: - I wanna play that more than I wanna play Hans Doutanika but I foresee it having less long-term possibilities.

603
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:58,178
Scott: I think it'd be more like fun while it lasts but I think Hans Doutanika could become a game you play for a long time.

604
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:03,638
Scott: But I feel Hans Doutanika felt a lot similar to Brass which I have.

605
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,920
Scott: So it's like I already have Brass, I don't need to buy that one.

606
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,940
Rym: - I would buy Hans Doutanika if they weren't 100 bucks on Amazon.

607
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,560
Scott: - Well I'll go check it at the Strad.

608
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,017
Rym: - That's what I'm gonna do, you never know.

609
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,756
Rym: - You never know, you never know.

610
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:29,459
Rym: This game however, in the early days before we got into German board gaming culture and just played these games on our own, the way we'd learn is we'd all independently read the rule book and then we'd play.

611
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,860
Rym: Then we got into the board gaming culture which is very much a culture of the oral tradition.

612
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,380
Scott: - People don't wanna read rules.

613
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,539
Scott: For some reason reading rules is not fun and people don't wanna do it.

614
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,820
Rym: - So most people learn board games by having someone else teach them.

615
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,140
Scott: - And they get the rules fucking wrong.

616
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,160
Rym: - Yeah, one asshole gets the rules wrong, teaches 100 other assholes and then you'll have an entire generation playing a game wrong.

617
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,399
Scott: - 'Cause of one guy who's illiterate.

618
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,940
Rym: - Nevermind games that have rules changes.

619
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,540
Rym: - Glory, oh not Glory to Rome.

620
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,879
Rym: Seven Wonders has some of that, there's different copies of the rule book that say different things in certain key areas.

621
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,438
Rym: Carcassonne has no less than three completely different ways to score farmers depending on what rule book you have.

622
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,478
Scott: - I've never met a person who is new to Netrunner that plays it properly from the get go.

623
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,580
Rym: - That's just how it goes.

624
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,440
Scott: - They're like, oh if it doesn't have it in the run, do I still have to break this ice?

625
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,599
Scott: It's like no, just keep going.

626
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:25,518
Rym: - I am now going to fully read the rule book of any game, even if someone teaches it to me.

627
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:29,078
Rym: 'Cause there are a lot of games I play that I've never read the rule book for.

628
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,818
Scott: - Oh yeah.

629
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,860
Rym: - Like Eclipse, I've never read it, I've been taught.

630
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,159
Scott: - Yeah, there were games, well I've read the rule book for Eclipse.

631
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,458
Scott: - But not the expansion one.

632
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:40,000
Scott: Yeah, there are games where we've been getting the rules wrong the whole time.

633
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,880
Rym: - Well remember the first time we played Puerto Rico.

634
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:42,820
Rym: we got it way wrong.

635
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,239
Scott: - Wasn't there something we got wrong in Seven Wonders this whole time that we discovered?

636
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,437
Rym: - Now I'm trying to find--.

637
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,280
Scott: - There was some game over the weekend where we discovered we'd always been playing it wrong.

638
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,800
Rym: - Yes, but I found a copy of the rules online at least.

639
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,159
Rym: that says the way we were playing, so I could do some research.

640
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,093
Rym: But the biggest one was Amun-Re, which we got something wrong, we fixed it like a year later, wrongly.

641
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,020
Rym: And then years after that, we were playing with someone at a con and they were like, "What the fuck?

642
00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:16,176
Rym: "That's not how that rule

643
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:16,379
Rym: works.".

644
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,194
Rym: And we all looked at each other and we're like, "What, no, no, no, we looked in the rule book, "no, no, no, we were

645
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:21,417
Rym: wrong.".

646
00:35:22,143 --> 00:35:25,100
Rym: So even the gamer-iest gamers get this shit wrong.

647
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:34,839
Scott: The moral, at some point, even if you've been taught how to play a game-- - Read all the rules, not just the sections that you're shady on, read every word, even the sections you are so sure of.

648
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,040
Rym: - And read it cover to cover.

649
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,140
Rym: - Yeah, every word.

650
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,898
Rym: - And also, if you learn a game like Small World and then someone tries to play Vinci with you, just don't.

651
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,778
Rym: If games are very similar, pick one and never play the other one.

652
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,560
Rym: - 'Cause I still fuck up Small World because of Vinci.

653
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,460
Scott: - Yes, I have a hard time playing Small World.

654
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:54,773
Rym: - Yeah.

655
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,960
Scott: - All right, what else did we play--.

656
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,860
Rym: - So I played this game that friends taught us correctly.

657
00:35:59,142 --> 00:36:01,576
Rym: I have learned which friends are trustworthy and which ones aren't.

658
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:02,999
Rym: Ginkgopolis.

659
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,799
Scott: - Okay.

660
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,700
Rym: - It's hard to explain what's cool about this game, but it works with two players.

661
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:13,300
Rym: It can be played one player, kind of like Agricola can.

662
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:17,460
Rym: I'm really at a loss for how to describe this game.

663
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:25,659
Rym: It's kind of like tile worker placement, but the mechanics are, it has no less than three pretty unique mechanics.

664
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,292
Rym: I really can't, Scott, I bought it, I ordered it.

665
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,139
Scott: - Okay.

666
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,778
Scott: - 'Cause I liked it.

667
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,760
Scott: - You spent all the money you want.

668
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,298
Rym: - It was cheap.

669
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:41,118
Rym: We have to play it and then we have to review it because it's really difficult to explain, one, I don't know if the game's good, but I enjoyed it.

670
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:47,099
Rym: Two, it is very difficult without going into extreme depth to explain this game, it needs an entire show.

671
00:36:48,260 --> 00:37:02,299
Rym: But even if it ends up being bad on multiple playthroughs, Ginkgopolis gets points for being way different from any board game I have ever played, yet using the concepts and mechanics of board games that I'm intimately familiar with.

672
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:06,020
Rym: I like it and I can't explain it until later.

673
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,719
Scott: - Did you play, we didn't play this at MAGFest, we played it at New Year's.

674
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,779
Scott: Did you play Coop, C-O-U-P, Coop?

675
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,980
Rym: - I watched other people play it, but I was involved in something else at the table.

676
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,540
Scott: - Okay, so here's how the game works, right?

677
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:23,819
Scott: It was a game that I've seen around a lot lately, just like I've seen Love Letter and The Resistance around a lot lately.

678
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:31,120
Scott: It's a similar small box game, seemed to be played by the same kinds of groups of people, like that casual board game meetup kind of game.

679
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:33,199
Scott: After playing it, I can see why.

680
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,799
Scott: Here's how it works, real simple game.

681
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,257
Scott: There's a deck of cards, there's different roles, there's two copies of each role in the box, right?

682
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:47,599
Scott: Everyone gets two face down, you look at 'em, but you don't show anyone, 'cause it's a bluffing game.

683
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:51,015
Scott: On your turn, there's certain actions you can do, right?

684
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,480
Scott: Like take monies, kill people, et cetera.

685
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,040
Scott: Killing people I think costs like $7 or something.

686
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:03,880
Scott: There's a limit to how much money you can have, which actually ruined the most obvious strategy that I had.

687
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,780
Rym: - Oh, I have my question and you can answer it after you keep talking.

688
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,520
Rym: Is it just the balloon popping game?

689
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:12,663
Scott: - Similar.

690
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:12,890
Rym: - Okay.

691
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,049
Scott: - Not quite though, right?

692
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,270
Scott: 'Cause it's not about voting, right?

693
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:25,310
Scott: It's you basically can only pop a balloon if you get up to seven, which is hard to do, right?

694
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:32,170
Scott: So it's sort of like, it's like one person can, basically you have to earn a vote first, which is where the game happens, is the earning of the vote.

695
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,849
Scott: Also, let's say there's certain actions you can do.

696
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,850
Scott: Like you can always take one dollar, but if you want, you can try to take two dollars.

697
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,509
Scott: But if someone is the Duke, they can say, uh-uh, you don't get two dollars, you get zero.

698
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,090
Scott: They can cancel your action.

699
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,930
Scott: Now, let's say that happens.

700
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,642
Scott: Let's say it's me, Rym, and Emily, and Emily goes, "Taking two

701
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,086
Scott: dollars.".

702
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:55,509
Scott: And Rym says, "Uh-uh, I'm the Duke, you can't do that.

703
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:56,701
Scott: "I'm gonna stop

704
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:56,823
Scott: you.".

705
00:38:57,732 --> 00:39:03,767
Scott: Emily can either say, "Okay," and put the two dollars back, or could say, "Fuck you, Rym, you don't have the

706
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:04,029
Scott: Duke.".

707
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:08,649
Scott: And if you have the Duke, you turn it over and one of Emily's characters dies.

708
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,510
Rym: - All right, so it's balloon popping game with bullshit.

709
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:18,970
Scott: - Exactly, and if you do have a Duke, I mean, if you don't have a Duke, one of your guys dies 'cause you were lying, right?

710
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,068
Scott: So that's pretty much it.

711
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,849
Scott: Whoever the last person alive wins.

712
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:40,650
Scott: So I realized the game gets really kind of silly and pointless after a few people were eliminated, and pretty much a lot of who wins and loses is determined by who people decide to eliminate early, right?

713
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,910
Scott: It's like if someone decides to kill one of your guys first, well, you're not gonna win now, right?

714
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:51,550
Rym: - Now, see, this is why a lot of listeners always try, like at conventions, they don't listen to the show that often, or they haven't listened to old, old episodes.

715
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:54,660
Rym: They're always like, "Oh, man, you should play "The Resistance, all these

716
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:55,065
Rym: games.".

717
00:39:55,913 --> 00:40:03,670
Rym: And the reason I'm always really down on them is because they're all either just synodels or mafia, so I might as well just play synodels or mafia.

718
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,850
Scott: - Yeah, well, I haven't played The Resistance.

719
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,461
Scott: It's supposedly the better mafia.

720
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,730
Rym: - I played it, it's better in the same way that Eucharonia is better than Glory to Rome.

721
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,869
Scott: - I was afraid of that.

722
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:25,748
Rym: - Like, it's different, it does interesting things, but if I'm gonna play a game that's like that anyway, I might as well, I'd rather play a pure version of that game.

723
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:29,710
Rym: I'd rather just play the purely political, purely psychological mafia.

724
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,570
Scott: - But yeah, if you're that kind of, you know, gamer who's not super serious.

725
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,549
Rym: - I love the way you said that.

726
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,250
Rym: If you're stupid, you're like stupid shit.

727
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,470
Scott: - You're that kind of person that goes to NerdNYC meetup and whatever and enjoys it and loves that kind of stuff.

728
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,490
Rym: - That's my new insult, Scott.

729
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:48,030
Rym: Any time someone likes something that I don't like, I'll be like, "Well, that's a great anime.

730
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:48,703
Rym: "if you're that kind of

731
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:49,029
Rym: person.".

732
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,009
Scott: - You're that kind of person, yeah.

733
00:40:51,354 --> 00:41:01,889
Scott: Then KU is actually, you know, it's just another one of those great games for the people who like games such as Pandemic, The Resistance, Battle of Sargalactica, et cetera.

734
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:04,510
Scott: If those are your kind of game, put KU on the list.

735
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,206
Scott: You'll fucking love it.

736
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,090
Rym: - So speaking of KU, we played at MAGFest.

737
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,929
Rym: We got a bunch of our friends together who they're all like hardcore gamers like us.

738
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,909
Scott: They've never played Citadels.

739
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:15,570
Rym: So we busted it out and played it.

740
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,269
Scott: - We didn't finish it.

741
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:20,390
Rym: - I love my friends because they'd never played this game before.

742
00:41:20,672 --> 00:41:26,650
Rym: We taught them, we started playing, and they did the right thing and ruined the game.

743
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,250
Scott: - And they immediately shuffled the hands.

744
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,590
Rym: - Everyone immediately, the whole game was random.

745
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,550
Scott: - Half the table was randomly choosing.

746
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,990
Rym: - Everyone acted randomly.

747
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,349
Rym: At one point, I arranged the cards and handed them to my left.

748
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,310
Rym: And that person was looking at the cards for a while.

749
00:41:38,591 --> 00:41:39,968
Rym: And then they stopped and they looked at me.

750
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:44,049
Rym: And then they put the cards under the table and shuffled them and put one face up.

751
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:45,310
Rym: It was beautiful.

752
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,049
Scott: - I actually, twice, chose non-randomly to see if that would help.

753
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,670
Rym: - I acted like I was choosing randomly, but decided hoping that at least one of our friends was gonna be stupid.

754
00:41:55,751 --> 00:41:57,229
Rym: And it turned out no one was stupid.

755
00:41:58,112 --> 00:42:00,450
Rym: I was really banking on one person being stupid.

756
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:03,370
Rym: A person, not a particular person, but anyone.

757
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:09,290
Rym: All I needed was a person who was stupid and I could've eked out victory 'cause I basically saw citadels.

758
00:42:09,992 --> 00:42:16,470
Rym: But nope, the game, at one point we were like, is everyone just going to act randomly until the end?

759
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,229
Rym: And they're like, yup.

760
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,270
Rym: And we're like, okay, we're done.

761
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,308
Scott: - I think we just had something else to do.

762
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,329
Rym: - Well, we wanted to play Eclipse.

763
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:22,926
Scott: - That too.

764
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,190
Rym: - I played a little game, Cheaty Mages, that Adam had.

765
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,590
Scott: - Oh yeah, I saw that.

766
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,549
Rym: - It was actually really fun.

767
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:42,550
Rym: So it's this little game and it's gladiatorial arena and you bust out all these gladiators and they're gonna fight like the dragon and the demon and the goblin and your mages and you bet on who you think you're gonna win and it's horse betting.

768
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,987
Rym: So you bet on one guy, two guys, or three guys with lower payout if you bet on more people if one of your guys wins.

769
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,350
Scott: - I would just go all in on one guy each time.

770
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,250
Rym: - Yes, and then you take turns playing cards, basically cheating.

771
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,870
Scott: - To get the odds of your guy winning?

772
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,629
Scott: - So you'll cast spells.

773
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,529
Rym: Some spells are open, like make this guy weaker, make this guy stronger.

774
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,389
Rym: Some spells go face down.

775
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,230
Scott: - Can you bet on the same guy someone else bet on?

776
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:04,750
Rym: - Yeah, it's secret betting.

777
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:05,902
Scott: - This is obvious.

778
00:43:05,943 --> 00:43:06,329
Scott: what to do.

779
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,950
Scott: In the round one, I don't wanna go first, right?

780
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:11,090
Scott: I want someone else to go first.

781
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,128
Rym: - You don't know what people bet on.

782
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:12,815
Scott: - Oh.

783
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:13,708
Scott: - Yeah.

784
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:14,056
Rym: - Oh.

785
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:14,787
Rym: - Yeah.

786
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,670
Scott: - Well then nevermind, I don't know what to do.

787
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,750
Rym: - So to make matters more interesting, here's the catch.

788
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:21,430
Rym: Every battle--.

789
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,190
Scott: - Can I wait to see how they cheat before I bet?

790
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,989
Rym: - Yeah, you bet first and then you go around betting and doing stuff until everyone passes.

791
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,870
Scott: - Oh no, I wanna bet after people do stuff.

792
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,850
Rym: - You get six spells, you can cast as many as you want.

793
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:37,609
Rym: You draw three at the end of the turn with a hand limit of six and you do three turns.

794
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,049
Rym: Like three go-arounds.

795
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:45,609
Rym: The key is that every go-around, you randomly flip over a judge and the judges all have specific rules.

796
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,709
Rym: Like can't cast forbidden spells, can't cast direct spells, do whatever the fuck you want.

797
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:55,069
Rym: And it's just really fun and really quick and really light.

798
00:43:57,211 --> 00:43:58,629
Scott: I think I played another game.

799
00:43:59,010 --> 00:43:59,783
Rym: - Jungle Speed Safari.

800
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,170
Rym: you played.

801
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,250
Scott: - Oh, that's the one I was forgetting.

802
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:07,930
Rym: - So I watched you guys play and when you all went rah, rah, I decided that game looked stupid.

803
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,630
Scott: - It is L-stupid.

804
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,710
Scott: Do not play Jungle Speed Safari, just play Jungle Speed.

805
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:13,408
Scott: - Yep.

806
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,047
Scott: - The end.

807
00:44:14,793 --> 00:44:15,510
Scott: It's a baby game.

808
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,630
Rym: - We played some Jungle Speed, I got cut.

809
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,210
Rym: Like I got cut and bled all over the totem, it was awesome.

810
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:21,787
Rym: - Chia cut me.

811
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,460
Scott: - I think there's one other game we played.

812
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:27,879
Rym: - Oh, we played Eclipse.

813
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,660
Rym: I kind of want to talk about our game of Eclipse.

814
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,900
Scott: - That's what I was suggesting.

815
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,780
Rym: - All right, so before we get to Eclipse, played a lot of Glory to Rome, which Scott is down on.

816
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,100
Scott: - I mean, it's not a bad game.

817
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,000
Scott: It's just you guys play it so fucking much.

818
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,158
Rym: - So I played it a bunch.

819
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,000
Scott: - You played more games of Glory to Rome than I played of Netrunner.

820
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,399
Rym: - So I played Glory to Rome a bunch of times.

821
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,420
Scott: - Played so much Glory to Rome.

822
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:54,460
Rym: - And I put a lot of thought into who was playing with me and why they wanted to play Glory to Rome over other games.

823
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,716
Rym: And I figured it out.

824
00:44:56,561 --> 00:45:03,619
Rym: One, because Glory to Rome is fairly straightforward rules wise, like it's actually pretty easy to teach for as complex as it looks.

825
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:09,739
Rym: Pretty much everyone we know knows the rules, which you can't say about almost any other good game we own.

826
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,716
Rym: Any game, El Grande, Puerto Rico, Teen E.

827
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:13,820
Scott: - You know why?

828
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,259
Scott: Because people play Glory to Rome instead of playing those games and learning them.

829
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,679
Rym: - Two, the game is pretty quick.

830
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:25,360
Rym: Like 45 minutes at most, if everyone knows what the fuck they're doing.

831
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,019
Rym: And three, it is a game of skill.

832
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,959
Rym: - Yeah, and four, no one we know has solved it.

833
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,159
Scott: - You can get a bad draw.

834
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,359
Rym: - Yeah, you can, but I've learned to mitigate that.

835
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:41,079
Rym: So the novel thing is that I played a few games of the Imperium version, which I haven't really played much.

836
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:47,900
Rym: And I really like the Imperium version now because in the normal game, a lot of people follow the leader often.

837
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,619
Rym: In the Imperium version, like I lead a role and most of the time, most people think.

838
00:45:54,662 --> 00:45:57,460
Rym: Like it is way hard to do anything.

839
00:45:58,543 --> 00:46:00,660
Rym: And you can't rely on luck of the draw.

840
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:04,039
Rym: You've got to have a strategy and you've got to commit to that strategy.

841
00:46:05,302 --> 00:46:08,739
Rym: So I'm going to play Glory to Rome only Imperium version for a little while.

842
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:11,920
Rym: And then I'm going to probably write something up about it.

843
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,140
Scott: - I'll play some Imperium version.

844
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,416
Rym: - Well, we'll do it, we'll do it.

845
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,519
Scott: - So we played a game of eclipse.

846
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,560
Rym: - With everything.

847
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,319
Scott: - With every, absolutely every expansion thing there is.

848
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:27,868
Rym: - I liked everything except for the, I think alliances.

849
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:31,840
Rym: just, you cannot play eclipse with the alliance mechanic if you were smart.

850
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,580
Scott: - Yeah, I'm not a fan of the, I'm definitely not a fan of the alliances.

851
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,740
Scott: Not only cause they make the game way, way longer, right?

852
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:42,820
Rym: - We can, we now understand exactly mechanically why it makes the game take longer though.

853
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,920
Scott: - So the reason it makes the game take longer, the first reason is sort of a meta reason, right?

854
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,839
Scott: It's like, let's say you're playing a game, any game.

855
00:46:50,661 --> 00:46:52,859
Scott: And on your turn, you think of what to do and you do it.

856
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:55,520
Scott: And you're good at, you're a fast turn taker, right?

857
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,279
Scott: Doesn't, right?

858
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:56,739
Scott: Any game.

859
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:04,020
Scott: If you have an alliance, suddenly on your turn, you're now discussing with your teammate what to do.

860
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:06,200
Scott: Not like bridge, we're not allowed to discuss, right?

861
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:07,200
Scott: You're discussing.

862
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,620
Rym: - And that happened in our game.

863
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:10,420
Rym: As soon as I was in alliance with the A.

864
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:18,140
Scott: - The act of talking, hearing takes way, way more time than the act of just thinking and deciding.

865
00:47:18,561 --> 00:47:26,039
Rym: - I have to say things like you move your guys there so that when the gray token comes to me, I can build a unit to move it.

866
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:34,420
Scott: - Every single turn, constantly talking, the two allied people took on their turns, Raymond, more time.

867
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,120
Rym: - Three allied people.

868
00:47:35,281 --> 00:47:35,757
Rym: We had Pete too.

869
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,299
Scott: - Pete wasn't really.

870
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,260
Rym: - I'll get to Pete.

871
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:41,739
Rym: I'm going to call Pete out for being shit at eclipse, but we'll get to that.

872
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:49,219
Scott: - Anyway, you know, you just frigging took so long in your turns because you had to physically talk to other people about what you were going to do.

873
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,419
Rym: - There's a secondary problem with the alliances that further exacerbates this.

874
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:56,020
Rym: So with a lot, with I'm playing by myself.

875
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,760
Scott: - This counts for any game of the alliances, but eclipse also.

876
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,738
Rym: - I can use really rough heuristics to follow what's going on in sectors of space that are far away from me.

877
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:12,520
Rym: And I only need to apply complex heuristics to my immediate neighbors or emergent situations that I could affect in some fashion.

878
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,760
Rym: Like I ignore Scott 'cause he's behind Andrew.

879
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,119
Scott: - I'm so far away.

880
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,380
Scott: You can't affect me and I can't affect you.

881
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,748
Scott: So don't even, you don't even need to pay attention to me on your turn.

882
00:48:21,788 --> 00:48:27,320
Scott: 'cause you can't do anything about it unless maybe I'm going to buy a science off the thing, in which case you couldn't stop me anyway.

883
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,179
Rym: - So let's say there's you and me and we're separated by Andrew.

884
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:34,280
Rym: And suddenly I see you move all your ships away from Andrew.

885
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,100
Rym: 'cause you're going to attack Pete.

886
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:37,180
Rym: That might affect my decision.

887
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:39,847
Rym: and now I'm going to go attack Andrew, but notice how.

888
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:41,200
Rym: it's something really broad.

889
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:42,940
Rym: He's moving a bunch of guys away.

890
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,520
Rym: If Chie is next to me, I'll be like, she built that fighter.

891
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,760
Rym: I'm going to walk over to her.

892
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,920
Scott: - It has this equipment in it.

893
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,539
Rym: - I'm walking over and looking at what that ship has and then calculating some odds.

894
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:57,319
Rym: But as soon as I was allied with Chie, I had to look at the whole board now.

895
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:02,580
Rym: And more importantly, I had to look at the other alliance and I couldn't just look at Scott.

896
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:03,819
Rym: I had to look at Scott's ally.

897
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,296
Scott: - I wasn't in an alliance.

898
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,100
Rym: - All right, the other two were in the alliance.

899
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:07,919
Rym: You were by yourself.

900
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,239
Rym: So now I have to look at the other alliance and every alliance.

901
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:19,640
Rym: So if there's an alliance and then two lone wolves and then I'm in alliance, I have to analyze all the other entities every turn.

902
00:49:20,243 --> 00:49:21,620
Rym: I can't ignore anything.

903
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,660
Scott: - You have to play for your whole team basically.

904
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,960
Scott: Everyone on your team has to play for your whole team.

905
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,760
Rym: - And every turn I have to calculate.

906
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,000
Scott: - You're all the quarterback of the whole three team army.

907
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,986
Rym: - And I have to calculate.

908
00:49:32,067 --> 00:49:33,840
Rym: not just will this get me points?

909
00:49:34,022 --> 00:49:40,260
Rym: I have to calculate, does this give my team more average points than it would if I did Y or Z?

910
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,600
Scott: - That's the specific thing to Eclipse that makes it even harder for the alliance.

911
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,630
Rym: - Yeah, and alliance's score is the average of all the members.

912
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,420
Scott: - You're calculating the average of your three guys.

913
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:54,060
Scott: So it's like, well, this is the way I can get the most points but if I did this, our average score would go up more.

914
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,520
Scott: So we should do that instead.

915
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,120
Scott: And suddenly everything takes longer to calculate.

916
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:07,079
Rym: - And luckily, while they're highly political, that is unlike Dune, mitigated heavily by the fact that you can really only ally with people you've gotten into contact with.

917
00:50:08,563 --> 00:50:11,600
Rym: And interestingly, I don't think the alliances are actually political in most cases.

918
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,179
Rym: Like in this game, I did not want to ally with Jie.

919
00:50:15,502 --> 00:50:26,299
Rym: I was forced to because the way the board ended up, we shared a border into the galactic center and then Pete drew tiles that had a wormhole on them and Jie drew a tile that had a wormhole on it.

920
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:31,199
Rym: So there's a wormhole connecting Jie and Pete and I was neighboring Jie.

921
00:50:32,183 --> 00:50:38,340
Rym: We were forced into an alliance because otherwise Pete would have attacked Jie and there would have been this huge cycle of bullshit.

922
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,618
Scott: - But why not have a cycle of bullshit if you can come out on top?

923
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,140
Rym: - Because I didn't think I could come out on top in that situation.

924
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,919
Scott: - Well, then if you don't think you could have, one of those other two people was going to.

925
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:50,874
Scott: Is that not correct?

926
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:51,219
Scott: - Ah, but.

927
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,660
Scott: - So why did that person choose to ally and not just attack?

928
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:03,998
Rym: - So Pete allied because he planned from the beginning to break the alliance and fuck us and the only way to get us to stay away from the wormhole was to be in an alliance with us.

929
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,360
Scott: - Oh, so he wanted to ally to get you to move a certain way and then break it so they get lost.

930
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,979
Rym: - So on the last turn, he's like, I betray you.

931
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,100
Scott: - But you can't break an alliance on the last turn.

932
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:19,159
Rym: - Yeah, so now we had to play the last turn with an ally who tried and could not betray us, who is still in our alliance, we couldn't kick him out.

933
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:19,619
Scott: - Right.

934
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,759
Rym: - Also, he derped around and kind of just fucked up.

935
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,519
Scott: - Well, you allied with someone just because they were touching you.

936
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,480
Rym: - We had to because we had no way to defend ourselves otherwise.

937
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,500
Scott: - Why don't you defend yourself?

938
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,300
Rym: - Yeah, so the alliances ruin Eclipse.

939
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,799
Rym: Do never play with alliances.

940
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:41,900
Scott: - Right, another thing is that there's all the extra stuff in the Eclipse that isn't alliances in the expansion.

941
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,060
Scott: It just gives you more stuff.

942
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,720
Scott: - I disagree.

943
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,660
Scott: - It's not good, it's not bad, but I don't think it really makes a difference.

944
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,420
Rym: It just makes more calculations.

945
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,779
Rym: - Basic Eclipse is super boring.

946
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,240
Scott: - It's not super boring.

947
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,200
Rym: - I think it's super boring.

948
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,240
Scott: - It's not mechanically different.

949
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,120
Scott: You don't make different decisions, it just takes you more time to calculate.

950
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,140
Rym: - No, the galactic center falls basically immediately.

951
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,319
Rym: It's just a race to the center and a race to research and aliens are just victory points.

952
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:16,159
Rym: At least with the strong aliens, it forces you to have a cycle of development and you have to plan between attacking aliens and attacking people.

953
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,180
Scott: - Nah, the aliens aren't that much harder.

954
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,959
Scott: The regular aliens are still on the board.

955
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,660
Scott: The galactic center, I was gonna take it out if you didn't interfere.

956
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,939
Rym: - Your ship sucked ass.

957
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,819
Scott: - My ships are great.

958
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,240
Rym: - Yeah, how come I destroyed your fleet with almost no damage to mine?

959
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,878
Scott: - Because I built galactic center fighting ships, not Rym fighting ships.

960
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:43,820
Rym: - Scott, I said out loud because we're in that alliance, every turn for multiple turns, if Scott attacks the galactic center, I'm sending my glass cannons in to fuck him.

961
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,800
Scott: - Yeah, which is why I thought you weren't gonna do it.

962
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:52,900
Scott: And you also, on the very turn that you did it, you were ho-humming and not so committing to it and I was like, he's not gonna do it.

963
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,840
Scott: - Well, because I could have glass cannon fell.

964
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:55,940
Scott: - That's what I was saying.

965
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,080
Scott: I'm like, he's not gonna do it.

966
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,140
Scott: He's gonna go the other way.

967
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,760
Rym: - Yeah, and then I looked at your ships and your ships were bullshit.

968
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:02,038
Rym: So I attacked you.

969
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,140
Scott: - My ships were great against the galactic center.

970
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,580
Rym: - So were mine.

971
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,780
Scott: - Also, I got fucked by the god of dice.

972
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,359
Scott: But Alia acted.

973
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,700
Rym: - That's your fault for leaning on the table.

974
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,360
Scott: - Scott Johnson led on the table, not Scott Rubin.

975
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,320
Rym: - I'll put it this way.

976
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:23,260
Rym: We can debate about the other parts, like Scott and I don't agree 100%, but we agree, do not use alliances in Eclipse.

977
00:53:24,102 --> 00:53:26,960
Rym: But the parallel turn play actually is pretty great.

978
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,980
Scott: - Yeah, that was the thing I was actually the most skeptical about was the simultaneous turns.

979
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,660
Rym: - You were like, no, you were really mad about it before we played.

980
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,220
Scott: - But it ended up not, and in fact, the only times it mattered, no one else seemed to notice.

981
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:49,419
Scott: There were three times where I held on to the guy and someone else could have forced me to take my turn before they took their turn.

982
00:53:49,762 --> 00:53:54,757
Scott: But I really, really, really wanted them to take their turn first so I could see what they were gonna do.

983
00:53:55,744 --> 00:53:56,840
Scott: And they didn't even notice.

984
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,579
Scott: They just took their turn and passed the thing, and then I took my turn and passed the thing and wiped the sweat off my brow.

985
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,652
Rym: And I'm like, all right, if you're just gonna let me do that.

986
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,660
Rym: - Look at the elegance of the mechanic.

987
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,840
Rym: You don't have to make it an issue unless both people care.

988
00:54:13,841 --> 00:54:15,820
Scott: - But they were stupid not to care.

989
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,360
Scott: Were they not paying attention?

990
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,959
Rym: - Maybe they had other concerns.

991
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,038
Scott: - They must have.

992
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,219
Scott: - So I basically got my way three times.

993
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:31,300
Scott: But if I had been playing with a bunch of Scott Rubins, maybe the simultaneous turn mechanic would not have been so pleasant.

994
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,120
Scott: It's possible.

995
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,460
Scott: But yeah, it was still, in the real experience, it was much better than I anticipated.

996
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,500
Rym: - What game did I play?

997
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,799
Scott: - Would play again with simultaneous turns.

998
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,860
Rym: - I played this game.

999
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,820
Rym: It was at Skelter's party.

1000
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,600
Rym: I don't remember which game.

1001
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:47,700
Rym: Oh, right, it was Homesteaders, where it had that mechanic where basically, everyone does something simultaneously.

1002
00:54:47,862 --> 00:54:51,700
Rym: So we start playing, and I immediately just said, "I'm not taking my action.

1003
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,754
Rym: "till everyone else is taking their

1004
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:53,017
Rym: action.".

1005
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:00,976
Rym: And the guy who talks to the game sighs, pulls out the book and quotes a thing that basically says, "If any player makes an issue of this, "then play proceeds in this

1006
00:55:01,037 --> 00:55:01,239
Rym: way.".

1007
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:02,997
Rym: And he was like, "You're that guy,

1008
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:03,180
Rym: Rym.".

1009
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:03,528
Rym: And I was like,

1010
00:55:03,548 --> 00:55:03,732
Rym: "Yep.".

1011
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,317
Scott: - Yep.

1012
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,359
Rym: - You know what, I really wanna play Eclipse.

1013
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,459
Scott: - All right, let's play it.

1014
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:08,976
Scott: - Like right now.

1015
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,540
Scott: - All right.

1016
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,960
Rym: - Maybe we should play some two player.

1017
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:12,940
Scott: - All right.

1018
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:13,819
Rym: - See how that goes.

1019
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:15,480
Rym: That might be interesting.

1020
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,760
Rym: - Maybe I'll come over this weekend.

1021
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:19,058
Rym: Wanna play Eclipse over footballs?

1022
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,320
Scott: - Buy, oh we don't have a table in my house.

1023
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,280
Rym: - On the floor.

1024
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:23,859
Scott: - And we don't have an expansion.

1025
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,140
Rym: - Kitchen floor, no expansion.

1026
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,920
Scott: - Buy me the expansion.

1027
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,959
Rym: - I thought you hated the expansion.

1028
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,020
Scott: - I thought you wanted the expansion so badly.

1029
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,879
Rym: - I could play without 'em, I just really like 'em.

1030
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:31,396
Rym: - All right.

1031
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,078
Rym: - Maybe there's laughing.

1032
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:36,519
Rym: All right, Magfest was fucking awesome and I think we're done.

1033
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,518
Rym: Any more games, is that it?

1034
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,520
Scott: - I'm sure there might have been, but I wanna go home and eat, I'm hungry.

1035
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,659
Rym: - Yeah, I'm also super hungry.

1036
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:44,759
Rym: So yeah, we're back in town, guys.

1037
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,639
Rym: We're gonna be doing GeekNights again.

1038
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:47,638
Rym: Watch out.

1039
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,180
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1040
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:01,300
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1041
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:06,700
Scott: - Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1042
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,639
Rym: - Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1043
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:14,340
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1044
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,915
Scott: - GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1045
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,200
Scott: - GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1046
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,340
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
