00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,266
Rym: It's Wednesday November 1st.

2
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:14,795
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:16,520
Rym: We review Boku Patiliro.

4
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:23,808
Rym: Let's do this and Thus a successful Halloween.

5
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:31,454
Scott: I neither egged anyone's house nor was my house egged Nor did I toilet paper any houses and my house was not toilet paper.

6
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:33,120
Rym: Have you ever toilet paper to house?

7
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,508
Scott: I toilet paper to tree.

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,038
Rym: Have you ever egged a house?

9
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,066
Rym: No, no, I've never done either.

10
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:45,980
Rym: okay, my pranks were always much more insidious involving butter butter butter.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:46,965
Scott: anyway.

12
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:50,797
Scott: We didn't get any trick-or-treaters.

13
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:53,228
Scott: That's because we turned the light off.

14
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,216
Scott: But also I didn't see any.

15
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:56,120
Rym: I saw a bunch.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,587
Rym: You see you weren't out after dark.

17
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:00,540
Scott: like I was I looked out the window a bunch of time.

18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,850
Rym: Where were you gonna look from?

19
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:03,200
Rym: from one side of the house?

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,349
Rym: You see the car dealerships from the other side of the house.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,460
Rym: see the car dealerships from the other side of the house.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,727
Rym: You see the forest.

23
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:10,034
Scott: I was looking at the street.

24
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:13,830
Scott: if there were trick-or-treaters They would have been walking down the street, um, which street.

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,279
Rym: they wouldn't have been walking down the street with no houses on it.

26
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:23,587
Rym: No the street that we live on the street that we live on all the houses are way away from us and I saw a Bunch of trick-or-treaters over there.

27
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:24,772
Rym: where the houses are.

28
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:26,420
Rym: our house is separate from those houses.

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,704
Rym: uh-huh, in fact as I was driving in I saw a bunch of trick-or-treaters and I thought Huh?

30
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:35,900
Rym: I better not just turn the light off.

31
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,071
Rym: What if they walk over here and I turn it off as they're halfway over?

32
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:41,360
Rym: that'd be the biggest bummer for some little kids ever.

33
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:43,786
Rym: Sorry kids no Halloween for you.

34
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:46,757
Rym: mean old guy over there turned his light off.

35
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:47,480
Rym: You saw you coming.

36
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:52,157
Rym: Yeah, so I waited and they never came and then I turned the light off because I had stuff to do.

37
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,064
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I don't know.

38
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:59,080
Scott: every year we say we're gonna do an awesome Halloween something and we don't do shit at all.

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,063
Rym: What are you talking about?

40
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:06,060
Rym: we had the lat the beginning of season two of GeekNights and we had an interview with Luke Crane.

41
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,567
Scott: Yeah, we didn't do that on Halloween.

42
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,960
Scott: Yeah, and the year before that we just started a brand new podcast.

43
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:15,840
Scott: We didn't trick-or-treat or or anything.

44
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,571
Rym: Well, you know what what we were planning on doing.

45
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:21,526
Rym: the reason we didn't have any other Halloween plans Is that way back.

46
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:25,831
Rym: Penn Jillette said he was gonna do a New York show So we had pretty much banked on going to that.

47
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:31,219
Rym: the show turned into Five people get to go and have a little party with him.

48
00:02:31,962 --> 00:02:35,815
Rym: Yeah, you had to call in live and do all this stuff talk about shit talking.

49
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,179
Rym: There was no way.

50
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:41,655
Rym: Well, the thing is he didn't technically say there was definitely going to be a show.

51
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:44,490
Rym: He just said there's a 99.9% chance there's gonna be a show.

52
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:53,440
Scott: Yeah, I noticed how he mentioned it once when he came up with the idea and then he totally didn't mention it ever again.

53
00:02:53,601 --> 00:03:01,180
Rym: Well by once he talked about it for half an episode Yeah, and then he suddenly brought it up again the day before Halloween when it was too late.

54
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:05,593
Scott: All right, it's anime day and we got some news about anime Expo.

55
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:06,275
Rym: Yeah, we this.

56
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,920
Rym: this is the only anime news out there.

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,631
Rym: We both found it Scott'll use it as his because he said he would and I didn't care.

58
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:14,260
Scott: It's sort of a little complicated news.

59
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:27,659
Scott: Anime Expo put out this press release that has been spreading around various places like sort of a mini wildfire Anime Expos that big big convention out in California if you didn't know.

60
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:33,220
Scott: Anyway, they have announced that they are going to open the anime Expo travel store.

61
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:44,880
Scott: It says in the press release it will provide discounted airfares hotels and auto rentals throughout the US and abroad for travel hungry fans Planning or booking their trips to conventions or personal vacations.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,153
Scott: So wait, wait, it's a travel store opened up by a convention.

63
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:54,440
Scott: now when you hear that Like if I told you Otakon opened up a travel store you would think huh?

64
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,739
Scott: They're gonna make one easy place to get hotels and transportation to Otakon.

65
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:07,587
Scott: Well, this is not a place to get Tickets in hotel rooms for anime Expo.

66
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,400
Scott: It is a completely generic travel store in every sense of the word.

67
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:15,205
Rym: So a travel agency Pretty much.

68
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:32,295
Scott: It's just a website that allows you to purchase Tickets rent cars get hotel rooms anywhere Basically anywhere at any time for any reason even if it's not anime related It's just a travel store with an anime Expo logo on it.

69
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:34,761
Scott: That's all it is It's.

70
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,646
Scott: it's kind of weird now.

71
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:45,839
Scott: then I realized when I looked at the URL that the URL they tell you to go to is Ax travel store.com.

72
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,407
Scott: Yeah, ax travel store.org.

73
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:52,740
Scott: when you actually go there the URL suddenly becomes travel dot.

74
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:54,565
Scott: I a n dot-com.

75
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:55,568
Scott: Well, what's I?

76
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:56,470
Scott: a n dot-com?

77
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:59,900
Scott: the interactive affiliate network a division of hotels?

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,682
Scott: Dot-com is a leading provider of affiliate marketing services and the supported travel affiliate market since 96.

79
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:12,223
Rym: So basically all they've done is contracted out gotten a front end for a thing that is kind of related to them But not really.

80
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:14,032
Rym: and there's probably some money changing hands.

81
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:22,279
Scott: Yeah, basically an affiliate network it on the internet is this new semi popular thing among people trying to make money.

82
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:28,155
Scott: and What they do is you have instead of have let's say new egg wanted to have affiliates, right?

83
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:29,800
Scott: Well new egg is a store.

84
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:40,960
Scott: What they would do is if new egg wanted to start an affiliate network They would allow you Rym to open up rims computer shop a brand new website on the internet that sells computer parts.

85
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:42,044
Scott: Really?

86
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:43,210
Scott: It's new egg.

87
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:50,159
Scott: It just says rims computer shop on it And if you do any business you get some of the money that new egg would have made.

88
00:05:51,103 --> 00:06:01,980
Scott: So all Adam expo did is try to make money By becoming basically a front end or yet another front end for the interactive affiliate network.

89
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:07,567
Scott: And they're passing it off as some sort of special Anime Expo travel store for anime fans.

90
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:14,551
Scott: and really it's just hey, please buy your make your travel arrangements at this Slightly shady website.

91
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,019
Scott: So the anime expo gets money.

92
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:20,440
Rym: Well, you see I don't even care about what's actually going on behind the scenes.

93
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:28,320
Rym: What I would point out is that it's not at all difficult to prepare your travel arrangements for an anime convention.

94
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,769
Rym: You call ahead of time.

95
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,540
Rym: how early you call depends on how big the convention is.

96
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:42,645
Rym: You get a hotel room and then on the day of the con or the day before the con you drive fly or take a Train to the city.

97
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,531
Rym: you check into your hotel room.

98
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:47,320
Rym: You might want to pre-register for the con.

99
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:52,076
Scott: I mean this would at least be a little acceptable if there was special discounts.

100
00:06:52,157 --> 00:07:03,059
Scott: for you know anime Expo but I did a search on their site to get a hotel room for anime Expo the next one and All these hotels are like special deals special deal.

101
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:10,700
Scott: So I searched for a random date to get a hotel room in Buffalo and everything said special deals special deal.

102
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,780
Scott: Ah, it's no different.

103
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:22,276
Scott: It's just a travel site with the anime Expo logo on it and they're passing it off To try to milk anime fans for money who don't know any better.

104
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:38,700
Rym: Oh, well I don't see anyone intelligent using this sort of thing to get to a con because anyone who knows what they're doing or has any level of intelligence just reserves a hotel room at the con rate and then Pre-registers are doesn't pre-register depending on whether or not they want to pre-register.

105
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:39,362
Scott: You know what?

106
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:53,425
Scott: I think we should do is we should just open up an affiliate, you know our own affiliate They're a GeekNights travel center and then we should open up like the GeekNights new egg affiliate and the GeekNights everything affiliate and we buy stuff from Ourselves and get a cut.

107
00:07:54,048 --> 00:08:00,800
Scott: so it's like getting a big-ass sale on everything we buy But we'll get our own hotel rooms through the GeekNights travel center.

108
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:05,014
Rym: Well, anyway speaking of NPR because I didn't have a segue there.

109
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:06,640
Scott: So I thought it was the craziest thing.

110
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,774
Rym: I thought I just kind of jump in with that.

111
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:16,500
Rym: All right There wasn't any other anime news because that stupid travel agency thing was pretty much the only thing out there that you guys would care about.

112
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:18,212
Scott: So there's some licenses.

113
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:19,982
Rym: Oh, whatever Chevalier.

114
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:22,633
Rym: Yeah, everyone knew Chevalier was gonna get licensed.

115
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:38,220
Rym: We all know Nana's gonna get licensed Yeah, but there's been an issue for a long time with XM satellite radio and Sirius to a degree with the fact that Most people who get it don't have a car that can accept an auxiliary input into the radio.

116
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:49,760
Rym: So they end up using a little FM modulator kind of thing Which is basically a tiny FM transmitter that transmits the audio from their series box onto an empty radio station.

117
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:51,159
Rym: Then they tune their radio to that.

118
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:57,240
Scott: Some of them also have a wire that is basically mimics the antenna of a raid.

119
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,790
Scott: You know the radio antenna and plugs into the antenna hole.

120
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,713
Rym: They're identical.

121
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,239
Rym: Yeah, there's no difference between them.

122
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:02,500
Rym: Really?

123
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:15,187
Rym: Yeah, the point is that these things Actually tend to be very very powerful to the point that if someone drives near them and they're tuned to this station Which should be empty, but they can set whatever they want.

124
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,940
Rym: They'll hear Howard Stern instead of whatever radio station.

125
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,094
Scott: This is very annoying because I had an I trip.

126
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:23,160
Scott: I got rid of my I trip.

127
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,328
Scott: I have something much better now.

128
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:25,980
Scott: that was expensive but worth it.

129
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:34,078
Scott: But the I trip followed the law and was as powerful It was allowed to legally be and it would get overpowered by XM.

130
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:43,359
Scott: So if I was using my I trip to listen to my iPod and I drove near someone listen to Howard Stern Howard Stern would overpower my iPod and have to pause the podcast.

131
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:48,500
Rym: now I note that I've never heard anything other than Howard Stern when this has happened to me in my entire life.

132
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:53,300
Scott: I think the only reason people one of the only reasons people buy satellite radio is to listen to Howard Stern.

133
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:54,995
Scott: I don't think there are really any other.

134
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:57,473
Rym: Very few.

135
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,080
Rym: the news Robin.

136
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:03,660
Scott: Yeah There are very very few people who have satellite radio who use it for something other.

137
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,724
Scott: Listening to Howard Stern at least around here I mean he's road.

138
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:15,630
Rym: even when I a few times I rode with a co-worker and For various, you know things I had to do for work and without fail if they had satellite radio They played Howard Stern the whole time.

139
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,274
Rym: We were driving.

140
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:16,737
Rym: Mm-hmm.

141
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:35,900
Rym: but these things are way more powerful than they're legally allowed to be like blatantly and Obviously and there's been a lot of legal disputes between the radio industry Which is a terrible industry that is on his knees and the satellite radio industry, which is doing very well.

142
00:10:36,342 --> 00:10:38,640
Rym: But I'm not particularly a fan of it for a lot of reasons.

143
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:41,288
Scott: Yeah I think the reason they want it to be powerful is twofold.

144
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:47,130
Scott: number one people driving around or randomly hear Howard Stern and maybe Really want to get satellite radio.

145
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,060
Rym: I really doubt that was part of the plan.

146
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,220
Scott: Yeah, but - it's they want satellite radio to sound good.

147
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:59,332
Scott: They don't want it to like cut in and out and they don't want people who don't have Auxiliary inputs to not be able to get satellite radio.

148
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:10,358
Scott: So the solution is to have a really powerful You know RF coming out of there so that it sounds great doesn't get interrupted Doesn't make satellite radio look bad and you can use it in any car.

149
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,212
Rym: now I had the problem with my.

150
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:13,200
Rym: I didn't have an i-trip.

151
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,739
Rym: I bought a nice Belkin transmitter, which is still within the law for my iPod.

152
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:26,479
Rym: But what I did is I mounted it to my dashboard and then I took the antenna off of my car Thus removing all outside interference and now I get great audio.

153
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:38,220
Rym: Yeah, I should have done that but I like my little antenna my car see I don't and I don't care because there is nothing On the radio I will ever care to listen to Unless the nukes fall and I need to find out how to avoid the radiation.

154
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:44,225
Scott: I will use the radio in my car in very few circumstances But there are some.

155
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:50,773
Scott: for example if the nukes fall if the nukes fall if I'm stuck in a traffic for more than an hour.

156
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:51,900
Scott: I got to find out what's up.

157
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:52,423
Rym: You know what?

158
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:54,619
Rym: I found if you're stuck in traffic for more than an hour.

159
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:57,700
Rym: The traffic news will not help at all.

160
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:02,780
Rym: All they'll say is that people are stuck in traffic or they'll say there was an accident.

161
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,387
Rym: They'll never give you any useful information.

162
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:10,996
Scott: or if like I knew there was a big blizzard coming I can find or if I used to use it for a school cancellation.

163
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:13,151
Scott: if I ever have kids That's what I'll use a radio for.

164
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:14,100
Scott: cool cancellation.

165
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,328
Rym: We just use the TV or the school's website.

166
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:18,636
Rym: have a TV or the school's website.

167
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:19,900
Scott: our school didn't have a website.

168
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:21,360
Rym: My high school had a website.

169
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,759
Rym: You could go you had it.

170
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,700
Rym: There's a number at the school you could call and they would have a pre-recorded message that either said there is school today.

171
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:29,748
Rym: There is not school today.

172
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:35,979
Scott: We are not sure if there's school today and If there's a super super important sporting event.

173
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:38,037
Rym: Okay, yeah.

174
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,639
Rym: Anyway, the issue here is that regular radio, you know?

175
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:51,568
Rym: normal old-school broadcast radio has been suing and trying to stop or get Regulations stuck on satellite radio for a long time.

176
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:56,180
Rym: They claim that it's unfair that people can say fuck on satellite radio.

177
00:12:56,883 --> 00:13:00,840
Rym: But but but they can't say it on their radio and that is hurting their ratings.

178
00:13:01,262 --> 00:13:04,640
Rym: So instead of lobbying to be allowed to say the word fuck.

179
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:11,260
Rym: They've been instead trying to make it so you can't say fuck on satellite radio and all sorts of crap.

180
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:24,720
Rym: Now lately the the first challenge that looks like it's actually gonna stick has come from NPR Who has pointed out that all these FM transmitters are in flagrant violation of all sorts of laws.

181
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,749
Scott: They are in flagrant violation of all sorts of laws.

182
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:28,230
Scott: to that.

183
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:28,973
Scott: I must agree.

184
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:44,860
Rym: and furthermore it particularly affects NPR because NPR stations across the United States tend to be in a certain area of frequencies The same frequencies that tend to be used the most often by these FM modulators.

185
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:49,130
Rym: So NPR tends to be blocked or overshadowed more than anything else.

186
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:53,999
Scott: They do sort of have a case.

187
00:13:54,702 --> 00:14:02,812
Rym: Well, no, they have a case in the against the FM modulator manufacturers who are usually Subcontractors of the satellite radio companies who have nothing directly to do with them.

188
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:03,695
Scott: That's true.

189
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:04,358
Scott: That's true.

190
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:22,660
Rym: And also while I agree with all the claims that NPR is making I also generally feel that radio as it is is Silly out of date and dead and I wouldn't care at all if they freed up that bandwidth Over the air for better and greater things.

191
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,100
Scott: Oh, I would be so happy if they freed up the bandwidth because really you don't need that many radio stations.

192
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:32,980
Rym: Well, not only that you could need that many radio stations and I can think of a lot of cool ways to use all that.

193
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:43,319
Rym: the problem is I Mean we live in I mean we live near New York City and there are radio stations that are clear and listenable on every single frequency and sub frequency.

194
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:52,695
Rym: I if you tune point by point there's always a station and Almost all of it is playing the same shit music or FM radio.

195
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:53,979
Scott: They're all playing the same radio.

196
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:56,810
Rym: It's crazy conspiracy theory Monday.

197
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,337
Scott: crazy conspiracy theory.

198
00:14:58,337 --> 00:14:59,080
Scott: 2 a.m.

199
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,440
Rym: Yeah, and of course you've got the morning wacky wavy inflatable arm flailing tube man.

200
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,087
Rym: Crazy radio guys saying crazy stuff.

201
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:14,640
Rym: I can't believe he's saying these crazy things on the air, but oh, he can't say fuck.

202
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:19,120
Scott: Yeah, there are really only two radio stations that I would even consider listening.

203
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,490
Scott: Well, maybe three because a pen radio.

204
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,988
Scott: if I had the chance I might listen to pen radio I would accept the couple times I did.

205
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:26,991
Rym: there were these ads.

206
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:31,586
Scott: Yeah, that's the only reason I want the other two stations I would even consider listening to on the radio.

207
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:39,779
Scott: and this is if there was absolutely necessary your 880, which is pretty much Constant monotone news and nothing else.

208
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,723
Rym: Yeah I'm sure our listeners care about the frequency on a.m That you listen to.

209
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:53,380
Scott: that is only available in a small portion of the United 80s in CBS radio and in New York is like one of the loudest most powerful stations in the country.

210
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,325
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

211
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,702
Rym: Most of our listeners probably can't get it But I probably can't.

212
00:15:58,103 --> 00:16:02,356
Scott: and 660 which is all the New York sports all the teams.

213
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,634
Rym: I'm fan of which again I'm sure no one cares about.

214
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:06,460
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

215
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,112
Scott: That's the only thing I consider listening to to radio station.

216
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:13,860
Rym: when the CD player in my car started going I started listening to NPR a lot and I like NPR.

217
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,960
Rym: I listen to NPR podcast almost as much as I listen to any other podcasts, but regardless we'll see where this goes.

218
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:24,540
Rym: I kind of hope that radio just loses at every turn and eventually gets dismantled.

219
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:31,000
Scott: I kind of hope they both lose like I want them to have to make RF modulators that follow the law.

220
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,659
Scott: But at the same time, I don't know if I like that law.

221
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,811
Scott: The RF modulator shouldn't be illegal.

222
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:37,320
Scott: to have a powerful RF modulator.

223
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:45,287
Rym: The RF modulator thing is totally moot and doesn't matter at all because modern Car stereos are just gonna come with auxiliary inputs.

224
00:16:45,348 --> 00:16:46,691
Rym: Like they should have ten years ago.

225
00:16:47,092 --> 00:16:47,493
Scott: Yeah.

226
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:48,115
Scott: Yeah.

227
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:49,920
Scott: I don't know it all sucks.

228
00:16:51,120 --> 00:17:00,555
Rym: Go podcasting things of the day.

229
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:01,316
Scott: Oh, man.

230
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:02,337
Scott: This is a Larry's video.

231
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:05,166
Rym: I gotta tell you I got a video That wasn't so hilarious.

232
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,675
Scott: No, not hilarious.

233
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:07,519
Rym: Not at all.

234
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,233
Rym: In fact, it's kind of an offbeat thing of the day here, but it is animated.

235
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:12,258
Rym: So I'm gonna run with it.

236
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:21,980
Rym: You remember the Simpsons every year on Halloween would have the treehouse of horror Where they did a kind of a sketch show about Halloween scary kind of things.

237
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,935
Scott: Well, the best Simpsons episode ever is in fact a treehouse of horror episode.

238
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:26,880
Rym: you want to get sued.

239
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,944
Rym: That's really it's time.

240
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,506
Scott: Yeah.

241
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:36,430
Rym: Yeah, probably the most quotable episode of the Simpsons ever and I defy anyone to argue Otherwise, no beer no TV.

242
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,340
Scott: make Homer something something feeling fine.

243
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:55,859
Rym: Anyway Now the Simpsons has been going on for a long time and I stopped watching it pretty much right after I got to college When I just didn't watch TV anymore since I had too much other fun stuff going on in my life didn't even own a TV.

244
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,860
Scott: That's also when I stopped watching TV and the Simpsons.

245
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:04,200
Scott: I watched the Simpsons right up until the end of high school and then got to college didn't watch it anymore.

246
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,643
Scott: I mean maybe a few times it would be on because Simpsons is a popular thing to be on a random TV At college.

247
00:18:09,724 --> 00:18:11,980
Rym: Oh, yeah, we would watch daykillers a lot.

248
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:18,905
Scott: I mean if I was you know walking around and the Simpsons were on TV and there was a TV on Somewhere at the college.

249
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:22,520
Scott: odds are the Simpsons was on it, but I didn't watch TV.

250
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,791
Scott: I didn't have time to sit there and watch a whole episode.

251
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:26,439
Scott: So that was pretty much the end of it for me.

252
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:31,493
Rym: Yeah Now the treehouse of horror was almost it was the closest thing to religion my family had.

253
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:37,514
Rym: we would get a gather round and watch This thing every year as a family event because they were always hilarious.

254
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:39,100
Scott: Well, you want to hear something scary.

255
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:40,942
Scott: What?

256
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,287
Scott: what season the Simpsons is it?

257
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:42,989
Rym: Why?

258
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:51,868
Rym: this is the 17th treehouse of horror Which when Scott again Scott asked me this question He said I got a thing to show you.

259
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:58,009
Rym: and he shows me the most recent treehouse of horror that was on Yesterday Halloween, which is my thing of the day.

260
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:58,671
Rym: I've linked to it.

261
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,859
Rym: You can watch it on the internet for free.

262
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:11,377
Scott: It's actually some preview copy that wasn't meant, you know for people that someone got in trouble probably for sharing this Definitely or someone stole it which would be okay.

263
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:14,392
Rym: now He says to me how old do you think this is?

264
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:15,116
Rym: What sees?

265
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:16,040
Rym: how old do you think we are?

266
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,365
Rym: What season was this from?

267
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:20,237
Rym: I was like 17 out of the blue and I got it, right?

268
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:22,768
Scott: Yeah I think you saw the Roman numerals.

269
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:25,360
Rym: No, I cuz I was a big Simpsons fan.

270
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:28,540
Rym: I watched it from the beginning until I went to college.

271
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,920
Scott: Anyway, that's not the important part.

272
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:39,880
Rym: the important part is a lot of people have said that the Simpsons isn't funny anymore and that it's just really kind of lame and Poorly-written and slow and blend, you know, he's kind of ignored him because I didn't care and I didn't watch it.

273
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:40,879
Rym: I figured they were just haters.

274
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:49,048
Rym: We have a lot of theories as to why a show that once was super popular like Family Guy Suddenly people don't like it in its modern form.

275
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:53,580
Scott: Yeah, I mean we hadn't watched the Simpsons so we couldn't give the real answer.

276
00:19:53,741 --> 00:20:01,020
Scott: But like at one time I thought well Maybe it's just because they seen those old episodes so many times that they've discovered all the jokes.

277
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:05,400
Scott: You know now when they see a new episode they don't see all the jokes right away.

278
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,450
Scott: But as the episode gets old it sort of gets better over time.

279
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:13,120
Scott: like wine does well good wine does yeah saw debatably.

280
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,754
Scott: Yeah, yeah, we don't actually know the real answer.

281
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:17,020
Scott: That was just a hypothesis.

282
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,911
Rym: So now having actually watched a recent episode of the Simpsons.

283
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:24,080
Rym: I gotta say that show shouldn't still be on the air anymore.

284
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,944
Scott: It's not funny.

285
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:26,752
Scott: No, why is it still out there?

286
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:30,124
Scott: I mean there was a God the store.

287
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:31,528
Rym: the stories don't go anywhere.

288
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:33,432
Rym: they start and they don't finish.

289
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:35,458
Rym: the it's just it's not.

290
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:36,219
Scott: even that was my.

291
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,424
Scott: well There were two problems.

292
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:44,032
Scott: number one is that it was obvious when they were making a joke But only about 25% of the jokes are funny.

293
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:48,338
Scott: back in the day the Simpsons glory I'd say slightly more than half of the jokes are funny.

294
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:58,457
Scott: the second thing the biggest problem was that there were three short segments because it's a treehouse aha and None of the segments had resolutions.

295
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,520
Rym: they just stopped.

296
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:09,595
Scott: It's like it's like you're watching an episode and they they do a joke they do a joke they do a joke they do a Joke and then after one of the jokes that just randomly it's over and a new one starts

297
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:13,480
Rym: and the jokes weren't even funny They were just really forced and bleh.

298
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:22,518
Rym: Even worse the third segment was probably the most ham-fisted social commentary I've ever seen.

299
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:27,217
Rym: Yeah, aliens invade earth whatever and then it cuts to.

300
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:37,900
Rym: like three years later The aliens are having a rough time and they say basically Man, it sure was a bad idea to try and occupy these humans.

301
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,929
Rym: Yeah, hearts and minds blah blah blah.

302
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:42,754
Rym: Yeah, blah blah blah.

303
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:44,900
Scott: and you know now that I think about it.

304
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,040
Scott: I think someone was trying to be ham-fisted on purpose thinking that would be funny.

305
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,623
Scott: But guess what?

306
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,086
Scott: It wasn't.

307
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:50,991
Scott: it was lame.

308
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,199
Scott: Really really lame.

309
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:56,736
Rym: I don't think that they were that smart because all the other jokes were equally ham-fisted.

310
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:58,881
Scott: Yeah, I Don't know.

311
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:03,498
Rym: but but then not only is it ham-fisted but the ham fist is holding ham.

312
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,532
Scott: I was gonna have best hold a because it doesn't have fingers.

313
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:12,753
Scott: cuz at the end it's like Man, bacon tentacles holding on to another hand.

314
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:13,496
Rym: They're like man.

315
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:18,050
Rym: This is bad Dot dot dot just like Iraq's gonna be.

316
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:20,136
Scott: and then it was taking place in the olden days.

317
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:21,580
Rym: and then the episode ends.

318
00:22:22,723 --> 00:22:33,640
Scott: It was pretty pretty bad like two-fisted ham technique I mean, it's got to the point where the Simpsons comic books are funnier than the Simpsons cartoon.

319
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,371
Scott: I mean, I'm using only one episode to judge by you don't know.

320
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:40,200
Rym: know that we're perfectly justified in using one.

321
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:47,180
Rym: We are perfectly justified using one episode because it was the treehouse of horror which has always been the pinnacle of the Simpsons.

322
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:48,406
Scott: That's exactly right.

323
00:22:48,506 --> 00:22:49,993
Scott: I just you know, I got to point it out.

324
00:22:50,093 --> 00:22:51,540
Rym: All right, so let's get off of this.

325
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,994
Rym: I don't want to sidetrack the show cuz we got a fucking animator review.

326
00:22:55,055 --> 00:22:57,785
Scott: I tell you what, holy shit Do we have an animator review?

327
00:22:57,805 --> 00:22:58,808
Rym: this is our.

328
00:22:58,828 --> 00:22:59,570
Rym: you're my hero.

329
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:06,800
Scott: Yeah, but first before we review the anime I do have a thing of the day that I almost forgot cuz I was so excited about the anime.

330
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:08,059
Scott: I gotta keep this short.

331
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:11,113
Scott: Back in the day people were stupid.

332
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,700
Scott: Do you think people are stupider now?

333
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,885
Scott: You think people are stupider now.

334
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:15,548
Scott: they used to be.

335
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:16,150
Scott: you're wrong.

336
00:23:16,673 --> 00:23:17,657
Scott: You're you're absolutely wrong.

337
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:18,320
Scott: Here's the evidence.

338
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:28,264
Scott: This is a video of a Canadian daredevil named like Kenny Powers or something like that and he tries to jump a car Over the st.

339
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,352
Scott: Lawrence River, isn't that over a mile?

340
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:32,340
Scott: It's pretty damn far now.

341
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:34,629
Scott: Not only that but the car.

342
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:39,467
Scott: it's like a jet engine powered I think he says a Lincoln Continental.

343
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:43,460
Scott: I don't remember two little wing-a-lings with two little wing-a-lings on it not wings.

344
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,142
Rym: These aren't wings.

345
00:23:44,162 --> 00:23:45,687
Rym: These are like f1 wing-a-lings.

346
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:46,831
Rym: They're like a footlong.

347
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:47,172
Scott: Yeah.

348
00:23:47,252 --> 00:24:00,332
Scott: Now if you look at the headline of this video It's exactly what I was thinking before I read the headline and it says back before physics existed Daredevil's performed any stunt they wanted without knowing any better.

349
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:02,880
Rym: now, I think we shouldn't ruin what happens.

350
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,000
Rym: Let's let the the listeners see this stunt and see how it unfolds.

351
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:12,920
Scott: Yeah, all I can say is that it's obvious that this stunt is physically impossible.

352
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:17,572
Scott: It is not possible to jump a jet-powered car.

353
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:18,053
Rym: You know what?

354
00:24:18,274 --> 00:24:19,617
Rym: over a mile, you know what.

355
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:25,720
Scott: you could Theoretically turn the car into a plane in which case you could fly a mile.

356
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,281
Scott: Maybe.

357
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:29,166
Rym: all right, you know what?

358
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:29,728
Scott: What?

359
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:32,936
Rym: I don't think he thought his clever plan all the way through.

360
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:38,980
Scott: Oh Didn't any physicist tell this guy what he was doing?

361
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:43,263
Rym: I don't know if I was a physicist and a guy was like I'm gonna jump my car You know what?

362
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:47,579
Rym: It's like it's like that Monty Python sketch for the guys Like I'm gonna jump the English Channel.

363
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:53,239
Rym: And then he goes out and he jumps like two feet and lands in the water, yeah, that's exactly what it is.

364
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:57,079
Rym: alright, so Nobutaka Nishizawa.

365
00:24:57,822 --> 00:24:58,122
Scott: Great.

366
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:11,400
Rym: Nobutaka Nishizawa is is known for a number of shows that he's directed over the many years such as slam-dunk and Mazinger Z the movie Dragon Quest a crying Freeman.

367
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:12,663
Scott: Well, I'm not.

368
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:17,680
Scott: if I'm not mistaken anime world order refers to him as the niche Nobutaka Nishizawa.

369
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,985
Scott: It might be some other niche.

370
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:22,478
Scott: We it might be some other niche that they call the niche, but I don't know.

371
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:23,884
Scott: You'll have to ask them.

372
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:26,092
Scott: They'll probably listen to this episode and tell us.

373
00:25:26,473 --> 00:25:26,734
Rym: Yeah.

374
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:28,260
Rym: No, I wonder if they've seen this show.

375
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:35,632
Scott: I do wonder if they've seen this show because this show You see shows today, you know, there's a genre of anime.

376
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:38,120
Scott: That is the crazy wacky comedy.

377
00:25:38,644 --> 00:25:52,706
Scott: you know the Excel sagas the Elf-princess rain the galaxy Fraulein Una I don't know any other ones freaking chromati All those.

378
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:58,747
Scott: this is a really really old one Really old.

379
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:04,940
Rym: so the show we're talking about today is called Patiliro Patiliro or Patariro.

380
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:27,697
Scott: I think it's kind of weird because in the title everyone seems to call it Patiliro Patiliro P a ta ll i r o. But in the show the character Patariro looks at his watch on his wrist and in the watch It says P a ta r i r o two R's.

381
00:26:27,757 --> 00:26:29,804
Scott: so Patariro I don't know.

382
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:33,295
Scott: It's that Japanese LR mix-up that happens all the time now.

383
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:42,740
Rym: the premise of this show Is that there's a little little short son or prince of a dictator of some oppressive country.

384
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,550
Scott: Yeah, some Eastern European nation most likely.

385
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,957
Rym: I generally get the North Korea feeling from it But that's probably just because this is the era I live in.

386
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:55,279
Rym: yeah, but Imagine that it's like Kim Jong-il as a kid.

387
00:26:55,842 --> 00:26:57,066
Rym: that's what this show is about.

388
00:26:57,488 --> 00:27:03,265
Rym: and he goes off on diplomatic missions as a little prince and Hilarity ensues.

389
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:10,369
Rym: and by hilarity, I mean horrible pedophilia Homosexuality a lot of homosexuality go.

390
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:10,790
Scott: Yeah.

391
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:15,887
Rym: Now anyone who knows us knows that we are in no way Offended by homosexuality.

392
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:17,512
Scott: No, they're not this show.

393
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:18,857
Rym: All right go.

394
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:28,420
Rym: before we describe the plot I just want you to go to the link that we have put in the show notes You know to the anime news network encyclopedia and it shows a bishonin looking guy about to kiss this girl.

395
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:45,860
Rym: nope, nope, it shows a bishonin looking guy about to kiss another bishonin looking guy and the main character the little Patilero seems to also like the guy and Or the other guy and that everyone in the show wears mascara and yet no one in the show is female.

396
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:49,672
Scott: Yeah, let me sum up this plot of the first episode a little bit God.

397
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:56,953
Scott: The dictator is coming to France I don't remember and he's supposed to be on some diplomatic thing or something.

398
00:27:57,214 --> 00:27:59,300
Scott: The other prince is coming to France not the dictator.

399
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:00,380
Scott: Yeah dictators is dead.

400
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,606
Rym: He's the little dictator.

401
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:08,579
Scott: little dictator is coming to France on some diplomatic mission But really he's going to steal a painting because someone lied to him.

402
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,290
Scott: Well, you don't know about the lie yet.

403
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,517
Scott: You find out the lie at the end.

404
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:12,000
Scott: big deal.

405
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:13,272
Rym: Yeah, now don't get us wrong.

406
00:28:13,293 --> 00:28:14,040
Rym: The show is hilarious.

407
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:17,820
Scott: Yeah, it is freaking you just for the craziness.

408
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:18,922
Scott: The

409
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:32,235
Rym: opening scene is there's all these diplomats and police like standing out of runway waiting for a plane to land the planes coming in and after about 30 seconds of this Scott says oh the show looks really boring and not at all what I thought and he's about to turn it off.

410
00:28:32,255 --> 00:28:38,758
Rym: and then we point out that The plane veers way to the left and then it cuts to the crowd and they all turn their head to the left.

411
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:55,049
Rym: and then It the plane veers way to the right and the crowd all the way to the right and then they realize that the planes coming Straight for him and they panic and run away And then it cuts to the inside of the plane and this little dictator is just attacking the pilot for no reason and like tickling Him or something.

412
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:57,436
Scott: Yeah He was fucked up.

413
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:04,004
Scott: anyway, he comes to France is gonna steal a painting and With the little dictator.

414
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:05,509
Scott: He has these onion head guys.

415
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:08,900
Scott: The onion head guys are the generic henchmen of the little dictator.

416
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,929
Scott: They show up whenever he needs henchmen.

417
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,079
Scott: Yeah other North Korea all looks the same.

418
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:17,955
Scott: There is this guy, I don't know what the guy's name is I don't remember anyone's.

419
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:19,120
Rym: it was a ban koran.

420
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:21,424
Rym: It doesn't matter.

421
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:23,130
Rym: Yeah, no one's names matter.

422
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:23,993
Rym: Don't even worry about it.

423
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:26,582
Scott: Yes, but dude looks like a lady All right.

424
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:30,895
Rym: It's this tall thin the shonen guy with long black hair who wears eyeliner.

425
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,305
Scott: Oh, no, that's not the guy I'm talking about.

426
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:38,468
Rym: Oh, you're talking about the other tall Long haired guy who wears eyeliner.

427
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:38,850
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:29:39,412 --> 00:29:41,840
Scott: Well, they all wear eyeliner even a little dick to you.

429
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,364
Scott: Yes, lots of it.

430
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:46,031
Rym: No, we're not talking like they just look like they have.

431
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:50,043
Rym: no they they have eyeliner on really poorly done Eyeliner.

432
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:54,060
Scott: Yeah, like a whore or those girls in that district of Japan

433
00:29:54,802 --> 00:30:14,280
Rym: Now they call well, alright, so the little dictators sitting there at this table and he's got this woman, but it's actually a dude Attending to him and I you get the impression almost that there's some kind of romantic tension there Which the tension is explained later is something else and you wouldn't think it was romantic until you see what follows.

434
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:21,580
Rym: Yeah for this other guy who's tall with long black hair and eyeliner comes in and he's the what?

435
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,409
Rym: Bishonen killer or something like that.

436
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,680
Scott: Yeah, apparently the guy's nickname is Bishonen killer.

437
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,206
Scott: He's always like a detective or an.

438
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:31,034
Scott: oh, he's an mi6 agent.

439
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:32,480
Scott: He's like James Bond, right?

440
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,740
Rym: Yeah, he's gonna be a bodyguard for the little dictator while he's in town to prevent a diplomatic incident.

441
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:48,413
Rym: Yeah But really he's the Bishonen killer because apparently young boys fall in love with him in a very homosexual way And he's not the Bishonen killer as in.

442
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:50,120
Rym: I am a Bishonen who kills the ladies.

443
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:54,780
Rym: He's the Bishonen killer as any causes, but the Bishonen to go crazy?

444
00:30:55,241 --> 00:31:03,499
Rym: Yeah, even though he's a dude and right away the attendant to the little dictator Blushes and gets all meek and totally wants it.

445
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,906
Scott: The attendant is the first person I was trying to talk about.

446
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:12,832
Scott: so it's a dude who looks like a lady Who's a bit gets all blushed from a dude who looks like a lady.

447
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:15,459
Rym: This show is the opposite of brother dear brother.

448
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,054
Scott: Yet the dudes who look like a lady cannot get together because this is really annoying.

449
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:26,780
Scott: little dictator in the way.

450
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:31,620
Rym: Yes, and the little dictator decides this is where the show goes really off the rocker.

451
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:33,400
Scott: It makes no sense.

452
00:31:35,225 --> 00:31:40,117
Rym: So he's planning it and the the bodyguard is like, I know you're planning something.

453
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:41,300
Rym: I'm not stupid.

454
00:31:41,862 --> 00:31:43,729
Rym: I better keep an eye on you.

455
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,700
Rym: The only way to do that is to sleep with you tonight.

456
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:59,080
Scott: So they share a bed and the little dictators all like, ooh, I love you Bishonen killer and he keeps hitting on him Even the little dictators also a dude who doesn't look like a lady but does wear lots of eyeliner.

457
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:04,453
Rym: Yeah Yeah, yeah and it goes off from there.

458
00:32:04,694 --> 00:32:05,900
Rym: the plot doesn't really matter.

459
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:12,160
Scott: Yeah, there's an interesting bit where you see how little dictator actually pulls off the heist of stealing the painting.

460
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:16,600
Scott: But right after that, it's back to the Bishonen action.

461
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:24,808
Rym: Yeah, then the episodes over you get the sense that the little dictator and this guy are beginning to fall in love Which is kind of scary.

462
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:27,760
Rym: It wouldn't be that scary except that the little dictators like five.

463
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:31,293
Scott: Yeah, it's like this little tiny tiny kid.

464
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:32,860
Scott: Well, it doesn't even like a pet.

465
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:37,819
Rym: Oh in the opener, he has this magical cat that we haven't seen really yet.

466
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:56,892
Scott: Yeah I look at the anime news network encyclopedia entry and there's only like seven characters in this show and considering the little dictators from a country far away and The Bishonen killer is from Britain, I guess You gotta wonder how are they gonna physically get back together.

467
00:32:56,932 --> 00:33:03,219
Rym: since well we saw the episode two thing We're apparently the little dictator comes back on another mission because he wants to see this guy again.

468
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:07,739
Scott: It's just gonna constantly keep flying over to Britain and France to see this guy.

469
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:08,543
Rym: You know what?

470
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:12,197
Rym: That would probably make more sense than anything else in this godforsaken show.

471
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,747
Scott: god damn This show is crazy this show.

472
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:16,194
Rym: Don't watch it alone.

473
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:17,660
Rym: Get a big group of people.

474
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,694
Scott: Oh, if you watch this alone, something is wrong with you.

475
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:20,579
Scott: You know, I know you're gay.

476
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:28,866
Rym: You watch you watch Pata lira alone, but seriously get a group of friends and watch this show especially if you want to have some fun.

477
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:46,800
Rym: get all your friends like anime and get that one friend who doesn't like anime and Then corner him and sit down have a grand old party and watch this show because I'd like to see how normal people react to this because at least Haven't seen a lot of anime and being in that whole anime culture a show like this is just hilarious.

478
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:56,840
Scott: Huh, I see a story on anime news network that was posted in March of 2005 Wow a long time ago and it says Maya Mineo.

479
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:05,542
Scott: However, you say that Pata lira sayuki is to be made into a TV series scheduled to air June this year on kids Station.

480
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:13,933
Scott: the manga was previously animated as Boku Pata lira Broadcast on Fuji TV in 82. the one we're talking about is Fuji TV.

481
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:18,645
Scott: Yes, ooh, so there might be a newer one But that you know can be seen.

482
00:34:18,826 --> 00:34:23,217
Rym: well, all right how many episodes of this anime do you think there are?

483
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:25,088
Scott: It says right here.

484
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:29,847
Scott: There are 49 49. oh, I see what happened.

485
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:33,878
Scott: the original manga right was for is the?

486
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:35,344
Scott: that's the show We're talking about.

487
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:39,139
Scott: the original manga was turned into an anime called Boku Pata lira.

488
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:46,100
Scott: Oh, and it was 49 episodes in 1982 and the genres listed are adventure comedy and romance.

489
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:56,088
Scott: Pata lira sayuki is the story of you know sayuki and Goku and all that junk Told with the Pata lira characters.

490
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,420
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's where I screwed up because that's listed here as a link not as alternative time.

491
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:07,500
Scott: That's a 26 episode show from 2005 of the genres adventure fantasy and shonen.

492
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:09,659
Scott: I don't know how it's not also comedy.

493
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:11,833
Rym: Well, I guess we'll have to see it.

494
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:18,660
Rym: Yeah We're reviewing now Boku Pata lira, we'll have to watch Pata lira sayuki before we could pass judgment.

495
00:35:19,142 --> 00:35:20,245
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

496
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,108
Rym: I don't think it matters.

497
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:22,553
Scott: It really doesn't matter.

498
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:24,720
Scott: It's all the same crazy bad shit.

499
00:35:25,662 --> 00:35:32,495
Scott: Yeah, I mean if they suddenly make Excel saga sayuki I don't think it's gonna be that much different.

500
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:37,860
Rym: now We we could just make fun of the things that go on in this show more.

501
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:43,339
Rym: But just watch it cuz you can't make in front of a show like this is like beating up a dead guy.

502
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:48,031
Scott: Yeah, we basically just be repeating ourselves at infinitum.

503
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:49,655
Rym: Yeah now in terms of everything else.

504
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:52,918
Rym: The animation quality is pretty bad.

505
00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:54,285
Scott: Well, it's 1982.

506
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,731
Scott: So for 1982 I say this is run-of-the-mill.

507
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,867
Scott: You know, this is as old as we are this show.

508
00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:08,179
Rym: Yeah, there is a lot of Boys stand around looking at each other.

509
00:36:09,182 --> 00:36:10,999
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there's not a lot of colors.

510
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:22,760
Scott: it's pretty much solid colors everywhere and Nothing really moves fluidly and a lot of things are sometimes drawn in a scary way like oh, I don't look at that.

511
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:23,741
Rym: Yeah It does.

512
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:30,025
Rym: you remember I would run in stinky when you were a kid watching right in stinky the old red and stinky when you Wasn't allowed to be disgusting.

513
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:33,300
Rym: not the new terrible red and stinky where suddenly out of the blue.

514
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:41,008
Rym: Sometimes he just show this still zoomed in frame of like Ren's Pus-filled oozing sore.

515
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:44,180
Scott: Yeah, it's cuz he couldn't animate like a high-definition painting.

516
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:46,839
Scott: He would just paint a still frame and then zoom in on it.

517
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:56,585
Rym: This show does that with a little dictator like turning his face and his mascara and eyeliner and everything becomes super super Like out there.

518
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:57,368
Rym: and it's like.

519
00:36:57,388 --> 00:36:58,772
Rym: I can't describe it.

520
00:36:58,813 --> 00:36:59,776
Rym: You just got to watch this show.

521
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:09,300
Rym: Yeah Yeah, Boku Patiliro is a scary scary show That is hilarious to watch one episode of and I pity the fool who watches more than one episode.

522
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:17,649
Scott: Maybe if you were drunk and you had a bunch of people at your house and you were looking for something crazy Like hey, man, check out this crazy shit.

523
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:20,640
Scott: Yeah, you would show two or three episodes of Patiliro.

524
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:32,825
Rym: apparently the show was moderately well known or at least Finally remembered because when we had the first episode laying around and we started to put it on and asked Emily what it was And she knew immediately But she hadn't seen it.

525
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:41,080
Rym: So when we told her that it was about what we just said it was about She kind of flipped and we still have to show her to her to prove it.

526
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:52,940
Rym: I don't think many people we've shown we've talked about the show with have actually believed us as to the sheer level of Homosexuality and sexual tension that is present between these three characters.

527
00:37:53,622 --> 00:38:02,277
Scott: Yeah, I don't know any more about the history of the show or the manga or anything like that but I do know that.

528
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:05,888
Rym: What do you know, you don't know nothing.

529
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:08,697
Scott: I do know that I'm not watching anymore of it.

530
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,169
Rym: See here's the thing I kind of want to watch.

531
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:13,020
Rym: Oh god a few more.

532
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:14,103
Scott: I know you're gay.

533
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:14,645
Rym: now.

534
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:24,710
Rym: that the reason is that I want to see if the show Changes at all or goes in other directions or if it's just 49 episodes of that.

535
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:34,616
Rym: I I submit to you Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball star.

536
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:44,149
Scott: Yeah, but when you find out why he's trying to get steal this painting I think that's the tiny thing that ties into the other.

537
00:38:44,169 --> 00:38:50,531
Rym: he's trying to learn about his daddy and where he came from Being a little dictator in some weird country somewhere.

538
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,740
Scott: Yeah, I think that's that's the real plot.

539
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,306
Rym: That's speaking of Dragon Ball.

540
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:57,720
Scott: You mean the thin plot that ties together a whole shit ton of comedy.

541
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:07,248
Rym: But speaking of Dragon Ball apparently the episode director of this was none other than dice K Niccio who's responsible for Dragon Ball.

542
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:08,411
Rym: Dragon Ball GT.

543
00:39:08,652 --> 00:39:09,635
Rym: Dragon Ball the movie 1.

544
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:10,838
Rym: Dragon Ball the movie 2.

545
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:19,238
Rym: Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball Z the movie 1 2 3 5 6 the Dragon Ball Z special 1 and the Dragon Ball Z special 2 in addition to one piece.

546
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:24,137
Scott: So the guy who did Dragon Ball learn the ropes on Patilero.

547
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:24,920
Scott: Is that what you're saying?

548
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:31,392
Rym: I'm not making any sort of correlation of Effect study or anything here.

549
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:32,480
Rym: I'm not gonna make any claims.

550
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,799
Rym: I'll just note that this guy worked on more Dragon Ball than he worked on anything else.

551
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:40,700
Scott: Well, I mean if you work on Dragon Ball, it's hard to have time to work on anything else.

552
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,839
Rym: Yeah, so I'm sorry if we didn't review this show to the standard where we normally review shows.

553
00:39:46,744 --> 00:39:49,980
Scott: The show is kind of hard because the show's whacked out and crazy.

554
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,800
Rym: I mean we watched the whole first episode and immediately forgot every character's name because it totally didn't matter.

555
00:39:56,262 --> 00:40:03,278
Rym: yeah, and I don't know what else I could say just watch this show and Tell us what you think about it.

556
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:04,437
Scott: Yeah Really?

557
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:13,630
Scott: I think the main reason we reviewed this show is just to get someone else to watch it to make sure that we're not insane And hear what someone else has to say.

558
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,580
Rym: Yeah, I'd like someone to point out that they're not really Homosexual pedophiles.

559
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:25,120
Rym: It's actually this blah blah blah some sort of artistic thing that symbolizes the inner struggle between a child looking for a father figure.

560
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:27,387
Scott: No, it's just a bunch of dudes who look like ladies.

561
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:30,637
Rym: Yeah shooting guns at each other and being all dramatic.

562
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:36,351
Scott: Yeah smoke bombs going off Paintings getting stolen but not Lupin style.

563
00:40:36,492 --> 00:40:38,320
Rym: Yeah, but still in a fairly clever way.

564
00:40:38,481 --> 00:40:43,360
Rym: Yeah, pretty clever and I got to say I laughed out loud when the little dictator starts running away with that painting.

565
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:50,704
Scott: Yeah, little dictator is layers cuz he's little and cartoonish Despite also wearing mascara.
