00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,280
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 1st, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,500
Rym: Tonight we'll be covering the controversy surrounding the policy changes for Otakon's artist alley.

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,358
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,640
Rym: Man, I about fell asleep at work today.

5
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:23,520
Scott: I would have if I wasn't at a new office.

6
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:37,879
Rym: Well, I had to sit in a conference call with a bunch of idiots, and I almost fell asleep during it, and I had the phone on my ear, and I'm sitting there, and I'm just, like, I'm kind of ignoring them because I don't really need to babysit them so much, and I started to fall asleep.

7
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:42,300
Rym: And then I heard my name in the phone, and for a second I forgot that I was on the phone.

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,114
Rym: I almost just hung it up.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:44,825
Scott: Hilarious.

10
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:45,680
Rym: Yeah, it was great.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,020
Scott: I had trouble using the phone today because I don't use the phone at work so much, but today I had to call more people than I've called perhaps in the past year.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,637
Scott: And people were calling me while I was on the phone in a different line, and I didn't know what to do.

13
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:00,080
Scott: Because I don't know how to use the phone.

14
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:04,559
Rym: I've just been having all the issues with trying to set up, doing remote interviews.

15
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:05,960
Rym: We thought it'd be so easy.

16
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,180
Rym: We discovered that Skype is kind of worthless.

17
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,471
Scott: Especially with Linux.

18
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:10,259
Scott: Yeah.

19
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:12,340
Scott: Well, mostly because of recording.

20
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:14,159
Scott: If you don't want to record, it's fine.

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,540
Rym: Yeah, but if you want to record, even on a good PC, you need two computers, basically.

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,205
Scott: Yeah.

23
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:23,800
Scott: So, it's a good thing my work has this nice teleconferencing bridge we're going to use.

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,131
Rym: Yep, so we'll get to see.

25
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:29,719
Rym: And once again, we apologize for the audio quality of the interview bit.

26
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:32,299
Rym: That's as good as the cell phones can do.

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:40,400
Rym: But anyway, in the news, Wired is running a story about people who, using very little technology, track America's spy satellites.

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,419
Rym: And apparently they've been doing this for the last ten, twenty years.

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:44,904
Scott: Wait, wait.

30
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,028
Scott: So, were they just looking at it with a telescope?

31
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:52,460
Rym: Yeah, basically, the US, when they launch a spy satellite, do it kind of surreptitiously.

32
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:58,709
Rym: They'll often announce a launch of something, but they'll launch it at a different time, or a different trajectory, or from a different site.

33
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:04,720
Rym: And basically, the entire system of US spy satellites is secured only through obscurity.

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,599
Rym: I mean, the satellites are painted certain colors and designed in certain ways to be hard to spot, but obscurity is really the only thing they've got going for them.

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,099
Scott: You know, if you paint it completely black and non-reflective, you can't really see it.

36
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:17,640
Rym: Because of, you know, space.

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,240
Rym: One, they couldn't do that, because it needs to be reflective to reflect things like heat, and it needs solar panels and such.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,900
Scott: You could face the solar panels away from the Earth.

39
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:37,937
Rym: Two, more importantly than that, even a completely black object can be seen in space, because it stands out from, say, background radiation, or other brighter things that it blocks when it passes them.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:39,620
Rym: Yeah.

41
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:47,700
Rym: So basically, these guys, and they work all over the world, and there's a lot of groups like Heavens Above and C-SAT-L are the two mentioned.

42
00:02:48,501 --> 00:03:01,311
Rym: They just kind of watch for them in the sky, and they all correlate their data, and once they get enough spottings of an individual satellite, or an individual object, they can usually do enough math to accurately predict the satellite's trajectory.

43
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,545
Rym: And they've made big maps of all the spy satellites they've spotted out there.

44
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:13,231
Rym: Now, the US doesn't like this so much, and they've been summoned and subpoenaed and told to shut down lots of times, but technically what they're doing is not at all illegal.

45
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:14,140
Scott: No, it's not.

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,959
Scott: And I don't know, if a judge said they were guilty of something, and there wasn't a new law saying you couldn't do that, I'd be pretty pissed off.

47
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,799
Rym: Yeah, well, even the most asinine thing is that, say the government is angry about this, you know, hey, they're telling everyone where our spy satellites are.

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,779
Scott: So now astronomy will be illegal?

49
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:41,859
Rym: I submit that if a bunch of guys with some pieces of paper and binoculars and some telescopes can do this, I wouldn't put it past the foreign services of every other nation on this Earth to do the same thing.

50
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,679
Scott: Yeah, the thing is, what do these spy satellites even do?

51
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,528
Scott: All they can do, really, is take pictures and transmit data.

52
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:50,345
Rym: Yeah, taking pictures is key.

53
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:54,850
Rym: That's how the US does most of its ops when it comes to wartime, at least as far as I know.

54
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:57,720
Scott: Well, yeah, taking pictures is key, but anyone can take freakin' pictures.

55
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,139
Scott: You can take pictures of the spy plane, you can take pictures of anything, you know.

56
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,891
Rym: No, spy planes are, you know, they can be shot down, they can be noticed, they're more expensive to use.

57
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:07,920
Scott: Yeah, but here's the thing.

58
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:16,386
Scott: I submit to you that a spy plane has more actual security than the spy satellite does if you take away the obscurity.

59
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:21,980
Scott: Because a spy plane, alright, the only thing you can really do to a spy plane is maybe shoot it down, right?

60
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:23,899
Rym: Like when we got our U-2 shot down.

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,484
Scott: Right, but you know, they're really, really hard to shoot down, the spy planes, 'cause they go really, really fast and they're really, really high up.

62
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:35,596
Scott: So, that's not, that'll happen sometimes, but not often enough to be.

63
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:50,665
Rym: Well, the thing, from what I've read, the spy planes we have and all of our stealth bits are only effective against effectively third world nations, and Britain or France or any modern industrialized nation with a real military can just see all of our spy stuff.

64
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:51,332
Rym: Oh, yeah.

65
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:55,960
Rym: We've just never spied on anyone who had the capability to shoot us down or was willing to risk an international incident.

66
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,948
Scott: Well, we do spy on them.

67
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:59,639
Scott: We spy on them the old-fashioned way with James Bond and such.

68
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,100
Rym: Yeah, we mostly just have satellites.

69
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:02,862
Scott: Yeah.

70
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:11,780
Scott: Still, the satellites, anyone can point a dish at them and, you know, collect the encrypted data and then see what it is eventually.

71
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:13,260
Scott: It's not really so secure.

72
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,737
Rym: That's not, they don't care at all about that.

73
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:18,260
Rym: They care about people knowing when the satellites are passing over.

74
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:23,208
Scott: Oh, so they don't actually care if someone knows the useless information of where the satellite is.

75
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:24,905
Rym: Well, no, here's the thing.

76
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,159
Rym: Say you know where the satellite is.

77
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:35,391
Rym: Alright, then you know that spy satellites pass over your country X, Y, and Z, and there's a period of three hours every four days where no satellites can see you.

78
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:38,319
Rym: That's when you have all the trucks with the uranium drive around.

79
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:39,979
Scott: You know what?

80
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,009
Rym: That's happened to the U.S.

81
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:41,392
Rym: before.

82
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:43,048
Scott: India did it, I think.

83
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,825
Rym: Yeah, when they were developing their nuclear program.

84
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,108
Rym: You know what?

85
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:50,703
Scott: If India knows when the spy satellites are coming over, then the spy satellites are pretty much useless.

86
00:05:50,744 --> 00:05:53,759
Scott: We should stop wasting money on them and stop pestering these guys who see them.

87
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,370
Scott: I think that's the best idea, because that means they're pretty much useless.

88
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:08,420
Rym: Luckily, the article on Wired, it doesn't seem like they've been pestered a lot recently, so because I've known about this for a long time and it looks like the government's starting to realize that this isn't going to work so well.

89
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,240
Rym: Either that or it's all a giant conspiracy and the real spy satellites are actually completely undetectable in magic.

90
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:14,968
Scott: Could be.

91
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:15,473
Scott: You know what?

92
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:16,180
Scott: I got a better idea.

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,400
Scott: Let's say they're not magic or undetectable.

94
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,420
Scott: Just put up so many that there's always one passing over everywhere.

95
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,616
Scott: That way, even if they know where they are, they can't really do anything about it.

96
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:34,080
Rym: Well, China, not too long ago, asserted it's right that if it so desired, it could shoot down satellites.

97
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,693
Scott: Oh, right, right, right.

98
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,956
Rym: But then again, that was in retaliation to the U.S.

99
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:39,128
Rym: saying the same thing first.

100
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,159
Scott: Yeah, but seriously, shooting down a satellite is not easy.

101
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,471
Scott: I mean, shooting down a satellite is harder than putting one up.

102
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:46,765
Rym: Well, consider this, though.

103
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:51,915
Rym: Putting one up, usually the thing you're putting up is extremely delicate and fragile and you have to be very careful with it.

104
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:53,009
Scott: And you have to use a rocket.

105
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:53,759
Rym: Yes.

106
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:58,563
Rym: If you want to knock a satellite out of the sky, you don't need to shoot up a complex piece of equipment.

107
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:03,028
Rym: You shoot up a rocket with a weight on it, and you just ram it into whatever you're shooting at.

108
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,008
Scott: Yeah, but the rockets are expensive.

109
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,594
Rym: The satellite costs four or five times more than the rocket.

110
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:08,260
Scott: Really?

111
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,906
Rym: If not more.

112
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,708
Scott: Well, some satellites cost more.

113
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:11,599
Scott: Some satellites are cheap.

114
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,473
Scott: You know, it depends on the satellite.

115
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:15,191
Scott: Like, a TV satellite is kind of expensive.

116
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:15,918
Rym: Keep in mind that...

117
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,948
Scott: But just like a camera and a solar cell isn't so expensive.

118
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:22,826
Rym: Keep in mind that even a tiny tiny glancing blow will just destroy a satellite.

119
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:23,799
Scott: Oh, of course, of course.

120
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:27,573
Scott: But the point is that the rocket expense is equal either way.

121
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:34,525
Scott: So if I was going to destroy a satellite, I would always, you know, have my rocket expenses and put one up whenever I destroyed one.

122
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:37,028
Rym: Ah, yeah, because you're a rocket scientist.

123
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:38,159
Scott: I could be.

124
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:45,248
Rym: Lucky, I just thought this was cool, and props to these guys for doing this awesome hobby.

125
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,018
Rym: It's kind of like trainspotting, only not as dumb.

126
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:48,685
Scott: Alright.

127
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,814
Scott: Well, there's this girl named Inga something.

128
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:52,986
Scott: I don't know her last name.

129
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:58,049
Scott: And she, I think she was an intern, or... Nope.

130
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,784
Scott: She actually had a job as a legal clerk at a medium-sized intellectual property law firm in Midtown New York.

131
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:05,491
Rym: Alright.

132
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:09,512
Scott: And she wrote an article for The Village Voice called Code Warriors.

133
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:17,168
Scott: And it talked all about the free culture movement, specifically the NYU group that, you know, involved in that sort of thing.

134
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:19,899
Scott: And you know how DRM sucks.

135
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:21,895
Rym: Alright, something we can all agree on.

136
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:22,260
Rym: Yep.

137
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:29,918
Scott: And she was fired from her job at the IP law firm for holding views contradictory to what the firm does.

138
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:40,741
Scott: And it was weird because apparently the firm, like, overemphasized her right to express those views, but then it still fired her.

139
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:42,155
Rym: Uh-huh.

140
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:44,033
Scott: It's like, "Oh, you can keep saying this.

141
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:44,761
Scott: We have no problem with

142
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:44,902
Scott: that.".

143
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:45,468
Scott: But you're fired.

144
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:50,640
Rym: See, it's technically, it's a gray area there, but it, well, one, they're lawyers.

145
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,529
Rym: They probably know what they're doing, but it looks like it's technically legal.

146
00:08:54,135 --> 00:09:02,699
Rym: Because in the United States at least, and in states that are right-to-work states, which New York is, you can hire and fire some people for any reason at any time with no warning.

147
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:03,588
Rym: Perfectly legally.

148
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:06,919
Rym: The only things you can't discriminate against are protected classes.

149
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,189
Rym: Things like race, religion, gender.

150
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:11,900
Scott: Sexuality.

151
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,486
Rym: Yeah.

152
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,692
Rym: Actually, that one's still hotly debated.

153
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:16,320
Rym: Yeah, that sucks.

154
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,030
Rym: Because it should be protected.

155
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,879
Scott: It should be on the list.

156
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,920
Rym: And a lot of other things should be on the list, too, but they aren't.

157
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,402
Scott: Yeah.

158
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:22,314
Rym: But anyway.

159
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:23,448
Scott: You know what shouldn't be on the list?

160
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,056
Rym: Huh?

161
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:24,380
Rym: Wait.

162
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:33,019
Scott: Alright, so, um, the point is, is that however, uh, legal this is, it still smells real bad.

163
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,240
Rym: Yeah, I would definitely call, it's one of those situations that I would describe as legal, but unethical.

164
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:37,929
Scott: Yeah.

165
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,680
Scott: There are a lot of things that are legal that are just no good.

166
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:44,352
Rym: Yeah, like all the bribery in Congress, uh...

167
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:49,000
Scott: It's like, and the thing is, is she really wants to be an IP lawyer, and she still plans to be one.

168
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,384
Scott: That's like what she wants to be with her life.

169
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:57,646
Scott: And that's, she was working there seriously, but she just happens to have a different view on IP lawyer-ness.

170
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:04,420
Rym: So it's kinda like, Now, was it for her views on IP itself, or just for her views on DRM specifically?

171
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,459
Scott: It was because of this article she wrote that was published in the Village Voice that was anti-DRMs.

172
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,112
Rym: Alright, now, I submit that an IP law firm would have a vested interest in wanting DRM to go away.

173
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:26,279
Rym: Because without DRM, the laws are still in place, but now it's a lot easier to infringe, and thus they'll have a lot more business helping companies sue people.

174
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:27,168
Scott: Mmm.

175
00:10:27,955 --> 00:10:38,237
Scott: The other thing is, um, I think the line that got them was, "Oh, if there's a law, if there are laws I believe are wrong, I will break

176
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:38,398
Scott: them.".

177
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,420
Scott: And that's what the girl said in the article.

178
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,034
Scott: So I'm like, "Oh, I say the same

179
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:42,216
Scott: thing.".

180
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:44,240
Scott: But apparently lawyers don't like that.

181
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,279
Rym: Uh, I guess I can understand that.

182
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,193
Scott: Uh, we can't have any, you know, civilly disobedient lawyers.

183
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:55,672
Rym: There's always that funny poster that's on FARC whenever something like this comes up.

184
00:10:56,056 --> 00:11:00,319
Rym: It's a picture that says civil disobedience is still disobedience and it's just a cop beating the hell out of someone.

185
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:18,039
Rym: [laughter] So, my thing of the day, it's not particularly a new thing, but it amused me to great lengths while I was on that conference call I spoke about earlier at work today.

186
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:22,665
Rym: It's an archive of the endings of a whole bunch of video games.

187
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,433
Scott: Did they have the ending to Silver Surfer for the NES?

188
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:26,928
Rym: Uh, I don't believe I saw it.

189
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:27,494
Scott: Damn.

190
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:34,868
Rym: But I watched the ending to Shadowrun because as much as I love that game, I don't have, you know, a year of my life to beat it again.

191
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:34,969
Rym: Yeah.

192
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:41,093
Scott: All those games that just are not worth it, the endings online are pretty good.

193
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:42,990
Rym: [laughter] And it works really great.

194
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:45,220
Rym: Just a flash site and it just plays the ending in a loop.

195
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,726
Scott: Eh, not bad.

196
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,299
Rym: I don't know what else I can say about it.

197
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:51,007
Scott: Any, uh, particularly interesting games in there?

198
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:52,463
Rym: Uh, actually no.

199
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:53,898
Rym: It's pretty much really generic.

200
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:55,580
Rym: There's nothing off the wall or anything.

201
00:11:56,387 --> 00:12:00,710
Scott: Uh, see that would have made it really priceless if it was like game endings you've never seen.

202
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:02,226
Rym: No, they were all game endings.

203
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,207
Rym: either I've seen or I don't care about.

204
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:05,300
Scott: Uh, that sucks.

205
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:12,690
Scott: So, uh, animals doing funny things is pretty much one of the most, uh, greatest things you can capture on video.

206
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:14,003
Rym: Yeah, I could say so.

207
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:14,832
Scott: Like, you know.

208
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:19,460
Rym: We're not going to get into it, but we saw a funny animal doing a funny thing at our New Year's party.

209
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,688
Scott: Cat attacks kid.

210
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,296
Scott: [laughter] This is, you know, cat vs.

211
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:23,680
Scott: cat.

212
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:24,467
Scott: Yeah.

213
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:25,880
Scott: Dog chasing cat, yeah, okay.

214
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:34,447
Scott: So, uh, two of the best animals are actually in this new video, or semi-recent or recently discovered, I'm not quite sure I don't really care.

215
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:37,438
Scott: A spider and a snake.

216
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:38,966
Scott: Snake.

217
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:39,799
Rym: Uh, no badgers?

218
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:41,599
Scott: Nope, just a spider and a snake.

219
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,419
Rym: Alright, and what do they do?

220
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:44,711
Rym: Are they lovers?

221
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:45,280
Rym: They fight.

222
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,384
Rym: Fight?

223
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:47,320
Rym: As in to the death?

224
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:48,205
Scott: Yep.

225
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:49,299
Scott: And you know who wins?

226
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:56,487
Rym: I'm gonna get, wait, I would guess the snake, but because you asked me, it's gotta be fucked up, so I'm gonna have to go with the, uh, spider.

227
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,192
Scott: The spider does indeed beat the snake.

228
00:12:59,536 --> 00:12:59,900
Rym: Damn.

229
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,123
Scott: Basically, it looks like the snake must have been in a tree or something, I don't know.

230
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:09,080
Scott: And it looks like he got caught in the spider's web, which a snake can do if it falls out of a tree.

231
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:14,425
Scott: It's a little tiny snake though, but relative to snakes, I'd say it's about a foot long maybe.

232
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:15,112
Rym: Alright.

233
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:15,658
Rym: I don't know.

234
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:17,339
Scott: But just a nice little normal snake.

235
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:20,547
Scott: And it's like a deadly fucking Black Widow spider, right?

236
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:26,912
Scott: And it looks to me like the snake was trapped in the web and the Black Widow came along and gave it a little poison?

237
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,104
Scott: A little venom?

238
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:32,700
Scott: A little instant complete snake paralyzation?

239
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:39,460
Scott: And then it proceeded to, uh, web the snake into a little ball, which I guess it later ate.

240
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:41,279
Rym: Yeah, that's what spiders do.

241
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:50,518
Scott: Yeah, so, uh, if you have a deadly deadly spider and a deadly deadly snake, well let's just say this, if you have a spider problem, snakes are not your answer.

242
00:13:53,206 --> 00:14:04,505
Rym: And I just for the record would like to say that my thing of the day yesterday was the Dorodongos, which as Scott pointed out, I was so incensed in our argument that I, uh, kinda didn't even talk about it at all.

243
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:08,667
Scott: So could you say it's your, um, thing of the not day, or?

244
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:10,263
Rym: Uh, that wasn't funny at all.

245
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,455
Rym: I don't know where you're going with that.

246
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,687
Scott: Not so much thing of the not?

247
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,000
Rym: Nah, nah, you really got nothing.

248
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,434
Rym: There's not even a joke there.

249
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:16,769
Rym: You lost the opportunity.

250
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,860
Scott: Well you were the one who's got nothing.

251
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:19,251
Rym: Yeah, well you know what?

252
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:21,132
Rym: I thought oh, I'll just talk about it today.

253
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,760
Rym: And I looked at it again and I've lost interest completely.

254
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,060
Rym: So you're on your own on Dorodongos.

255
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,789
Scott: Take, take mud, make a shiny ball.

256
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:29,559
Scott: The end.

257
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:38,160
Rym: So as we mentioned at the start, today's show is going to be about Otakon and the, I guess, hullabaloo around their new pending, uh, artist alley policy.

258
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:53,840
Scott: For those of you who might not be informed, the policy is referring to the sale and I guess also the display of fan art or, you know, reuse of copyrighted characters from anime and manga in the artist alley of Otakon.

259
00:14:54,501 --> 00:15:03,377
Rym: Now, basically what happened was, on a Wednesday I believe, in a thread titled official changes to Otakon's artist alley policy or something like that.

260
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:04,388
Scott: On the Otakon forums.

261
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:11,357
Rym: Yeah, on the Otakon forums, they made an announcement as to all the changes to the artist alley and things like tables are six feet wide now and all this other stuff.

262
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:17,419
Rym: But tucked away in there, number five, after a large, bold thing that says this is the big one, is the following policy.

263
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,732
Rym: Otakon's artist alley will be actively disallowing the sale of unlicensed copyrighted materials.

264
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,509
Rym: If you own it, you can sell it.

265
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:26,569
Rym: If you have a license to it, you can sell it.

266
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,134
Rym: But if it has material, images, sounds, etc.

267
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:35,196
Rym: in whole or in part, in which you do not have permission to sell, then that material will not be allowed in the artist alley.

268
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:38,569
Rym: Anyone found a violation will lose their space, blah blah blah blah blah.

269
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:46,598
Rym: And then an addendum, the policy for display of unlicensed copyrighted material provided that it is not for sale is currently under review.

270
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,579
Scott: Now this is such a big deal because

271
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:50,548
Guest: while

272
00:15:50,690 --> 00:16:17,111
Scott: artist alley at Otakon and many other conventions has plenty of original artwork such as web comic artists and people making their own print comics and all sorts of other original works of art, much of it and much of the money is in the sale of fan art which is basically you take existing characters that you did not create and you draw them or write them or whatever into new

273
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:17,737
Rym: stories

274
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:19,534
Scott: or pictures or whatever.

275
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:25,378
Rym: Now bear in mind that fan art, while it's a word that we all use, is not a legal definition by any means.

276
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:34,340
Rym: And the people who are responsible for this decision and most of the people in the debate are very strongly urging that people shouldn't use that word and they should use more defined terms.

277
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,087
Scott: Yeah, I guess fan art could just mean art created by a fan.

278
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:45,369
Scott: I mean you could have a spinning blades somehow making art and you know call that fan art.

279
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:54,965
Rym: Now they made this announcement in the forums and without much fanfare and within hours to put it bluntly there was a shit storm on the internet about it.

280
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:57,209
Rym: I mean we found out about it.

281
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:58,380
Scott: Would you say the shit hit the fan?

282
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:07,509
Rym: Yes, we found out about it because one of our listeners posted a notice about it in our forums and we saw it and I saw what she posted and I thought, no way.

283
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:08,842
Scott: At first I pooh-poohed it.

284
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,268
Scott: I was like, oh it's just one of those things I have to write.

285
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:12,358
Scott: It's not actually a big deal.

286
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,280
Scott: And then I thought, oh wait, they're serious.

287
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,792
Rym: Now the thread where they announced it got longer and longer and longer.

288
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,005
Rym: It got locked a bunch of times.

289
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:20,419
Rym: People started flaming each other.

290
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:27,756
Rym: There were people who obviously have never been in the forums before who made accounts just so they could post their anger and outrage about it.

291
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,387
Rym: And it started out, and here's the tricky part.

292
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:34,680
Rym: It started out that this was announced and then there's this whole rigamarole.

293
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:39,043
Rym: and shortly after that, Anime News Network picked up on it.

294
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,780
Rym: And all this happened within a thread that's titled Official Changes.

295
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:58,160
Rym: Immediately after the Anime News Network article picked it up Jim Vowles, the head of Otakon, posted in the forum of Anime News Network clarifying that it's not in fact a done deal and it's not an official change and it's all pending.

296
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,123
Scott: Alright.

297
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:00,155
Scott: That's kinda fishy.

298
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:09,125
Rym: So we're not sure exactly what's going on at this point, but we have a lot of quotes from various staffers about the issue.

299
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:11,086
Scott: And we have a special guest to help us.

300
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:12,120
Rym: Yes indeed.

301
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:20,860
Rym: So without further ado, you might remember him from his famous Politics and Anime panel at Otakon and his upcoming Otaku Romance panel at Anime Boston.

302
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:23,670
Rym: And many people know him as The Jewish Wolfwood.

303
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,517
Rym: We've got Mike Pfeffer here with us.

304
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:27,559
Rym: So it's good to have you on the show.

305
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:29,256
Guest: Thanks, great to be here.

306
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:35,380
Guest: I've never done anything like this, so I'm still kind of, wow somebody actually wants me around.

307
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,895
Guest: I'm not throwing myself upon them.

308
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:36,976
Guest: Woo!

309
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:41,880
Rym: But I gotta say, I mean, we saw you did a cosplay way back and it was awesome.

310
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:46,328
Rym: And then we saw you when you did your Politics and Anime panel at Otakon.

311
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,699
Rym: And I gotta say, it was a really well done panel and we were impressed.

312
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,470
Guest: Thank you.

313
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,086
Guest: That was just, you know, that's actually something I just did for fun most of the time.

314
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:59,260
Guest: I mean, my senior thesis, you know, when I was a political science major, I did it on East Asian international relations.

315
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:08,599
Guest: And the fact that I had, like, four slides on that one manga that nobody had ever heard of, Kuniga Moiru, was because it gels with my thesis topic.

316
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,020
Guest: And I was just hammering that down, yet nobody knew what the hell I was talking about.

317
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:15,419
Guest: So it was just kind of like a logical extension, you know.

318
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:22,571
Scott: Yeah, I remember at that panel I was expecting you to talk about sanctuary and then at the end, some other guy yelled out and recommended it.

319
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,618
Scott: Did you ever actually get around to finding it or reading it?

320
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:33,037
Guest: Oh my god, after that panel I had about 20 people corral me and I had no clue about what to do next so I didn't have a chance to write down too much.

321
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:34,877
Guest: But, yeah, well, good job of that.

322
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,640
Scott: Yeah, there's this terrific manga called Sanctuary.

323
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:43,400
Scott: It's about a mafia guy and a guy trying to be the prime minister working together.

324
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,420
Guest: Wait, is that the one that's all black?

325
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,800
Rym: With the guy with the yellow cover?

326
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:49,540
Guest: I know exactly what you're talking about.

327
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:51,357
Guest: I can't find that anywhere, man.

328
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,330
Guest: I've got all of it and I've got all of Eagle.

329
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:57,839
Rym: So maybe I'll let it to you sometime.

330
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,678
Rym: You don't live far away.

331
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:01,439
Guest: Oh my god, that would make my day.

332
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:05,440
Scott: Also, you said you would go to New York City easily.

333
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:08,097
Scott: If you go to Midtown Comics, they have all of it.

334
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:09,959
Scott: That's right, they have all of it.

335
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,740
Guest: You know, I think I've really been there a couple times.

336
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,219
Guest: They have two branches.

337
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,860
Scott: One branch is near Times Square and one is on Lexington near Grand Central.

338
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:21,340
Guest: I think I've probably been to the one near Times Square.

339
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,300
Guest: I think I might have just been there once or twice.

340
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,500
Guest: Back then I was just trying to find the original Nadesko novel, the large print one.

341
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:31,439
Guest: This was before they reissued it and I was looking everywhere.

342
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,640
Guest: Nobody knew anything about it.

343
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,659
Guest: These guys had volume one.

344
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:35,859
Scott: Yeah, they have everything there.

345
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,880
Scott: But I think if you go to the Lexington branch, I'm pretty sure you'll have good luck finding volumes of Sanctuary.

346
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:44,200
Scott: All of it, if not at least a good portion.

347
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:45,320
Guest: Excellent.

348
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,260
Guest: I always like to try just hunting to get my hands on it before I resort to the Internet, because that's like using a cheat code if you've just got to find it online.

349
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,433
Scott: Yeah, I know.

350
00:20:54,562 --> 00:20:56,080
Scott: I know exactly what you're talking about.

351
00:20:57,661 --> 00:21:02,740
Rym: But basically, we've already introduced the topic at hand, the Otakon Artist Alley issue.

352
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:12,499
Rym: And considering that we saw you in the community about it and we know you to be generally articulate and interesting, we figured you would be a good person to ask about this.

353
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,144
Rym: Okay.

354
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,120
Rym: So tell us a bit about this Save Artist Alley live journal community.

355
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:23,480
Guest: Well, before I begin, I just want to state that most of this is just coming from my personal opinion, you know, standard disclaimer stuff.

356
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,799
Guest: I am not an Otakon staffer.

357
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:33,160
Guest: I have never been part of the running of Otakon, blah, blah, blah, not a law student nor an artist, just, you know, concerned Joe citizen here.

358
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:55,100
Guest: But from my understanding, the community that we formed, Save Artist Alley, is a community dedicated to getting people involved with returning Artist Alley to what we've known it to be, a place where people can gather and show what they've created, any creative works that might represent any sort of anime, manga, video game, any sort of topic or property they care to present.

359
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:11,600
Guest: And we're centered around the idea that – and this is just roughly me quoting since I'm not really in charge of the community or anything – we're centered around the idea that the spirit of the law is conflicting with the letter of the law and Otakon is taking overzealous steps in order to preserve the letter.

360
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:31,120
Guest: Now, we feel, mostly, and I'm not sure if there's any real single line that everybody's trying on here, but I think that what we're really going for is the idea that fan art, as an institution, as a creative work, is a protected form of expression.

361
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,640
Guest: I mean, I could draw a parallel for you.

362
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:44,919
Guest: Now, what this would go on with would be, let's say, I'm an artist and as part of my education, I paint a copy of Van Gogh's Starry Night, you know, the famous painting, right?

363
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,318
Guest: Now, let's say I paint this and it's a good replica and somebody's interested in buying it.

364
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:56,328
Guest: And it is clearly marked Starry Night, as interpreted by Mike Pfeffer, you know, 10 bucks.

365
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,201
Guest: So they give me the $10.

366
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,126
Guest: I give them the painting.

367
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:02,659
Guest: I've just made money off of Vincent Van.

368
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:02,860
Guest: Gogh.

369
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:05,271
Guest: Now, is Vincent Van Gogh going to sue me?

370
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:06,456
Guest: Can he sue me?

371
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:07,220
Guest: Or his estate?

372
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,905
Guest: Can his legal representatives collect damages or criminal penalties from me for doing this?

373
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:25,920
Guest: I say that with American copyright law, and to a lesser extent, international treaty, does not cover this effectively to the point where Oticon needs to take such draconian measures in order to enforce their policy.

374
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:40,840
Rym: - Well, I can say that I've got a large compilation of various quotes from staffers on this, because Jim Valls, the head of Oticon, pretty much put a moratorium on the staff commenting on this issue in light of the, well, flame wars that have appeared on their forums.

375
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:47,320
Guest: But it appears-- - You know, when you think about it, Jim Valls is really just trying to do some effective damage control.

376
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:48,254
Guest: I don't think he's involved.

377
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:48,478
Rym: - Oh, yes.

378
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:57,439
Rym: I definitely don't blame him for what he did, because honestly, their forums exploded and Anime News Network reported on it, and then he corrected them when they apparently made a mistake.

379
00:23:58,023 --> 00:24:08,380
Rym: But apparently, as far as I can tell, and this is based on my analysis of things the staff has said, they have not stated to me directly what has happened, but there's no legal pressure.

380
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,840
Rym: There's been no--like, a lot of people have speculated that maybe one of the anime companies cracked down on them, or maybe the dealers are complaining about competition.

381
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:29,319
Rym: But Rachel Ann, who's the head of Artist Alley, said, and I quote here when she was asked why this suddenly became an issue after 10 years of it being a non-issue, quote, "I'll take the blame credit for that.

382
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:35,836
Rym: "It was my decision to act on this for Otakon 2006, "and I thank our presidente and the Otakon staff for supporting

383
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:35,937
Rym: me.".

384
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,259
Guest: - Okay, I remember seeing that quote, and I also remember some of the surroundings, some of the actual other things she said concerning that.

385
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,340
Guest: You know, just to paraphrase Rachel Ann, I have nothing against her.

386
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:47,610
Guest: I don't know who she is.

387
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,520
Guest: I've never met her before.

388
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,200
Guest: Apparently, she encountered some sort of violation of an intellectual property that she herself had created.

389
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:57,620
Rym: I think it was some sort of play or puppet show.

390
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:22,600
Guest: Now, I understand that if she's coming from a perspective of a chairperson in charge of a department, let's say, just to back into more organizational terms, if she, acting as a chair of the department, had some sort of input in order to formulate a better policy, and this is just, you know, how to craft something together, I think that what might have happened here was that she used this policy as a little bit of an overzealous personal example.

391
00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:26,980
Guest: Now, this is not something that you need to rule out entirely, don't get me wrong.

392
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:35,260
Guest: Personal experience can help a great deal in making policy, in making rules and regulations, even for an organization like Otakon.

393
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:53,038
Guest: However, I think that what might have happened, and I really would have loved to see the minutes, the logs of that meeting where this policy was formulated, I think what happened was just a battle of here is what could happen, here's where I'm coming from as a creator, here's how I feel, and here's what we need to do to take steps against that.

394
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,120
Rym: And for what I see, that seems like it's a very good idea as to what happened.

395
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:11,840
Rym: I mean, looking at the conversations that took place before Jim Voll has kind of stepped in and started speaking for Otakon, Rachel Ann very specifically clarified the policy and did clarify it to be a very draconian thing.

396
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,080
Rym: She said that chibi art or chibi art would not be okay because it's not considered parody.

397
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:25,580
Rym: She said specifically that yaoi of characters is not parody, but rather exploitation of a licensed copyright character and will not be allowed.

398
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:26,983
Guest: I see.

399
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:33,919
Guest: That's where – I just want to state that I'm not a yaoi fan, and believe me, my little talk today is going to be full of disclaimers.

400
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,262
Scott: Neither are we.

401
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,259
Scott: We're fans of making fun of yaoi, not actually enjoying it.

402
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:41,383
Guest: Exactly.

403
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:44,251
Guest: But to each their own, I say.

404
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:50,580
Guest: And if it's going to be a form of exploitation, then they're going to have to define the exploitation that's happening here.

405
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,896
Guest: If somebody wants to draw as horrible as I feel using this example, Ed, Al, yaoi, come on.

406
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,466
Guest: That's not going to be great.

407
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:01,719
Guest: It's not really my cup of tea.

408
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,571
Rym: Oh, I've seen worse.

409
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:04,440
Rym: Have you read Death Note?

410
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:06,747
Guest: Oh, I've heard of it.

411
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,460
Guest: And believe me, I go on image boards, man.

412
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,909
Guest: I know about half of the yaoi that goes on the entire internet.

413
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,331
Guest: It's horrible.

414
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,245
Guest: And it's out there.

415
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:20,580
Guest: And it is used, and it does fall back under the same thing.

416
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:33,454
Guest: Even if you're drawing just Ed, Al hanging out, getting his automail fixed, if something's going on that is part of an intellectual property, even if it's not yaoi, it's still under Rachel Ann's definition of the phrase

417
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:34,258
Guest: "exploitation.".

418
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:41,119
Guest: If you want to go through a dictionary definition of exploitation, it's going to fall under a very different flock of geese here.

419
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,325
Guest: We're not exploiting.

420
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:48,360
Guest: This is basically expression that's really coming into question.

421
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,360
Guest: How does an artist express themselves with an established object?

422
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,760
Guest: How does an artist bring this about?

423
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,900
Guest: And there's a lot of legal definitions that I'm not sure have fully been addressed here.

424
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:02,919
Guest: I'd like to hear what the Oticon legal staff has to say about this.

425
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:05,165
Scott: Yes.

426
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:18,470
Scott: When at first I thought this might have been something the Oticon lawyers had come up with and told them to implement, but then when you noticed they didn't do anything about the cosplay or the AMVs, I said, "Oh, maybe they

427
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:18,711
Scott: didn't.".

428
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:22,738
Scott: And it turns out that as of now, they haven't actually talked to the lawyers yet.

429
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:30,200
Rym: Well, apparently the lawyer was sick, and they had a horrible flu for the past week, and that's the only reason he hasn't reviewed this policy.

430
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:42,979
Rym: But regarding the anime music videos and the cosplay, I do know that Oticon pays ASCAP license fees or something along those lines in order to be able to use the music for the AMVs, and they get the blessing of the industry to show them.

431
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,824
Rym: And as for the cosplay, their insurance policy, as far as my understanding goes, once again, I'm not Oticon's staff either.

432
00:28:50,845 --> 00:29:00,615
Rym: Their insurance policy covers public performances of arts, and selling an art is not considered a public performance.

433
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:03,688
Rym: It's considered a paid performance or a paid what you call it.

434
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:06,399
Rym: So it's not legal covering for the other two.

435
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:23,298
Rym: But when it comes to artist Allie, I actually pointed out to them, and Rachel Ann actually thought about it, and she's considering asking the lawyer about it, that by actively pursuing a policy of cracking down on copyright law, Oticon is actually opening itself up to liability as opposed to closing it.

436
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:28,980
Scott: There's also the issue that in artist Allie, they're selling things to profit.

437
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:36,372
Scott: You've got fan art, and you're trying to make money off of it, whereas the AMVs and the cosplays is just entertainment value.

438
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:38,260
Scott: You're not actually selling anything to make money.

439
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,243
Guest: Well, that's true.

440
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:47,860
Guest: And I do think that it is necessary for copyright holders to act on that infringement, but however, that's in the hands of the copyright holder to engage in.

441
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:50,910
Guest: For example, I heard that this is completely anecdotal.

442
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,880
Guest: I could be way off base or even completely wrong.

443
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Guest: At Katsu 05, and I know at Oticon 04, there was a table in the artist Allie that was selling hats, hand-made little hats, and among those hats were interpretations of characters from FMA.

444
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:07,651
Guest: He had a little Ed and Al hat.

445
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:09,600
Guest: It was cute if you like that sort of thing.

446
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:27,346
Guest: Funimation found out about this, and they had the person who was making them cease and desist, but in another wonderful twist of fate that could just be internet lies or complete utter truth, I think that Vic Mignogna himself will put in the rover for a couple of hats, just a personal commission

447
00:30:27,386 --> 00:30:27,909
Rym: from the

448
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:29,656
Guest: artist.

449
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:40,190
Guest: This could be completely wrong, but in this case, I don't see this, the artist Allie, and I could be legally incorrect, I don't see artist Allie as a public performance.

450
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,240
Guest: I don't see it as an art presentation.

451
00:30:43,461 --> 00:30:45,590
Guest: I don't see it as a viewing of artworks.

452
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:58,119
Guest: I see more of a commercial enterprise, but in this commercial enterprise, when you're dealing with something that is not necessarily the exact item that is under copyright protection, that is where the big question comes up.

453
00:30:58,581 --> 00:31:08,479
Guest: Is fan art an actual commercial profit off of an intellectual property, or is it simply an interpretation of an intellectual property as viewed through the eyes of artist X?

454
00:31:09,062 --> 00:31:22,900
Guest: And when you take away that interpretation, when you take away that ability to create, and then to distribute that creativity, and yes, we're talking about for money here, but we are talking about for works by artist X, not by Funimation, not by ATB Films.

455
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:26,600
Guest: Yes, they own the copyright, but are they selling copies of the DVD?

456
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:29,740
Guest: Are they selling cells that were made in the animation?

457
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,440
Guest: Are they selling official merchandise that's been bootlegged?

458
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:41,860
Guest: What I think this new policy is doing is equating the bootlegged anime that we see in the dealer's room to fan art, to individually created works of art.

459
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,559
Guest: I mean, even if we're just talking – I mean, just last year I got a pin of Haro from Gundam C, which I think is totally awesome.

460
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,529
Rym: I bought a little one.

461
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,699
Rym: Washcloth for my girlfriend, and she loved it.

462
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:58,025
Guest: Those are just totally great.

463
00:31:58,386 --> 00:32:02,040
Guest: And here's just an individual piece of creative art.

464
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:02,924
Guest: This is a button.

465
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:03,729
Guest: Look at the pins.

466
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:05,820
Guest: Somebody with a pin press adds anime bits.

467
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,243
Guest: It's got Haro on it.

468
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:07,665
Guest: Yes.

469
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,150
Guest: Is Bandai making this?

470
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:09,792
Guest: No.

471
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:11,398
Guest: Is it being marketed anywhere?

472
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:11,458
Guest: No.

473
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,566
Guest: Is this a Bandai product that is produced under license of Bandai under their sole control to distribute as they see fit?

474
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:19,289
Guest: No.

475
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,980
Guest: Is this something that one person sat down and made?

476
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,297
Guest: Is this something that one person has interpreted from their intellectual property?

477
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:26,940
Guest: Yes.

478
00:32:27,502 --> 00:32:34,446
Guest: Is it harming Bandai by producing this, which they do not have any production of or verifiable interest in?

479
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:36,674
Guest: As far as we can tell, no.

480
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,400
Guest: It does not harm the individual company.

481
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:40,564
Rym: On that point, I agree with you.

482
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:47,684
Rym: And I guess that kind of shows the point that this is a very legal gray area, as you elaborated.

483
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,900
Rym: And I feel that it's not Otakon's place to try to enforce it.

484
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:55,427
Rym: But Otakon should obviously comply.

485
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:03,600
Rym: If a dealer or a producer actually wants to stop someone and they have the legal right to do so, then they can deal with it on their own.

486
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,524
Rym: Otakon should help them.

487
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:07,660
Rym: But I don't think Otakon should be enforcing a policy on their own.

488
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:08,922
Guest: Exactly.

489
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:11,070
Guest: Look at the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

490
00:33:11,111 --> 00:33:13,380
Guest: This is big news for a lot of tech people.

491
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,883
Guest: And it takes.

492
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:22,276
Guest: every now and then, there's some big bust that involves an ISP having to turn over server logs to somebody that's using Kazaa or something else like that.

493
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:24,847
Guest: You know, "Oh my God, they're still using the old version of Napster

494
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:25,409
Guest: Nodes.".

495
00:33:26,012 --> 00:33:32,936
Guest: Well, what happens with the DMCA is that the government or the complainant in the party has to deliver a subpoena.

496
00:33:32,956 --> 00:33:37,671
Guest: They have to get on the record and put in the complaint to the ISP, who then provides the logs.

497
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:43,633
Guest: The ISPs are not responsible for patrolling these networks, although most of them do, just on their own.

498
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:46,584
Guest: They are not responsible for handing things over.

499
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:52,703
Rym: And in fact, that is the liability I was speaking about when I talked about Otakon opening themselves up.

500
00:33:53,967 --> 00:34:00,165
Rym: ISPs have common carrier status, meaning that they are not actually responsible for what goes over their wires.

501
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:15,360
Rym: However, if they choose at any time to actually invoke control over what goes over the wires, they have now legally opened themselves up to the fact that they can be held responsible for failing to act in a specific situation, because they've shown that they can act.

502
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:25,014
Rym: And by Otakon actively enforcing this, they're saying that they can act, and thus they can be held legally helpable if they do not act, which I could see them not acting.

503
00:34:25,054 --> 00:34:27,719
Rym: if there's eight staffers trying to police three to a hundred artists.

504
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:38,795
Guest: Well, I think that even with just those eight staffers, they can at least do something if they are forced to do so, if they're subpoenaed, if they are legally given a cease and desist.

505
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:43,011
Guest: That's why a company cannot just march in and say, "Hey, you're being sued for distributing this,".

506
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:45,380
Guest: and they're not properly wanting the artist.

507
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:52,882
Guest: I mean, let's say ADV doesn't like the fact that I'm selling Excel Saga, what sort of Excel Saga merchandise can I think of?

508
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:54,507
Guest: Excel Saga lunchboxes.

509
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:04,980
Guest: They don't have Excel Saga lunchboxes, fresh Menchie involved, but I don't think they have any on their sale roster.

510
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,068
Guest: And if they don't, what if I want to make them?

511
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:09,460
Guest: And they just march in and say, "No, you can't do this.

512
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,163
Guest: You're being

513
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:10,706
Guest: sued.".

514
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:12,113
Guest: Here I am saying, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

515
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:13,600
Guest: I didn't know you had an interest in this.

516
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,524
Guest: I know you own Excel

517
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:14,986
Guest: Saga.".

518
00:35:15,027 --> 00:35:17,720
Guest: Yeah, but you don't own any Excel Saga lunchboxes.

519
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,937
Guest: Without any proper oversight, then, ADV can just handle it down no matter what.

520
00:35:23,118 --> 00:35:23,500
Guest: I like ADV.

521
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:31,920
Guest: Dave Williams is a good guy coming out to cons and doing all this good stuff, despite what I have against the voice actors at some points, but that's another podcast entirely.

522
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:33,743
Rym: Yes.

523
00:35:33,763 --> 00:35:34,767
Rym: So here's a question for you.

524
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:38,500
Rym: Suppose the policy goes into play as it is written now.

525
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,520
Rym: What do you think will be the effect on Artist Alley this year?

526
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,791
Guest: Well, for one thing, the spirit is going to be different.

527
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:49,768
Guest: I can't really say about the actual numbers, but it's going to be fundamentally altered.

528
00:35:50,350 --> 00:36:00,280
Guest: I say, for one thing, that we're talking with First Amendment territory here, wherein the right to express is being basically taken down, and how many Otaku have the funds to fight this?

529
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:02,831
Guest: How many people have the time and effort to do so, even more?

530
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:20,270
Guest: If you just walk into Artist Alley, and you have – I always perennially think of just the kid who's 14, 15 years old, no real resources, finally managed to come to his first Otakon, and he or she wants to pick up his or her favorite drawing of character.

531
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,295
Guest: They like Winry.

532
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:22,580
Guest: They want their Winry drawing.

533
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,223
Guest: And it's not there.

534
00:36:24,564 --> 00:36:25,427
Guest: You can't buy this.

535
00:36:25,648 --> 00:36:41,640
Guest: You cannot go into this one area where individual artists who get no real exposure in any other mass form, unless you go around deviantART for fun, they don't really have the chance to market their wares, to show their skills in a way that's applicable to Otaku.

536
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:46,660
Guest: I mean, there are some incredibly talented artists down in the alley.

537
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,932
Guest: I mean, there's this one guy who I idolize.

538
00:36:48,952 --> 00:36:50,400
Guest: He does fantastic megadrawings.

539
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,520
Guest: I bought a fine printer from him of an arm sleeve from Full Metal Panic.

540
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:57,953
Guest: I fully intend to get one when he starts doing some Gundam scene work.

541
00:36:58,737 --> 00:36:59,480
Guest: What if he's not there?

542
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,095
Guest: What if he's just drawing generic Megabot 2000s?

543
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:07,053
Guest: That's all well and good, but I don't want generic Megabot 2000s.

544
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:08,479
Guest: I want my fucking arm sleeve, you know?

545
00:37:08,781 --> 00:37:09,022
Rym: Yeah.

546
00:37:09,203 --> 00:37:16,060
Rym: Well, I looked through my pile of art I bought for the last four years at Otakon, and there's a bunch of dozens and dozens of little prints and crafts I bought.

547
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:23,200
Rym: And of all of them, not a single one didn't include licensed characters in some pseudo-legal way.

548
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:24,983
Guest: Exactly.

549
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:28,700
Guest: And what that does in spirit, you know, we'll get onto practicality in a second.

550
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,400
Guest: In spirit, that takes away the entire reason for having an artist's alley, for having a gathering of people.

551
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,760
Guest: I mean, the whole purpose of a convention is to gather with like-minded people.

552
00:37:38,243 --> 00:37:40,636
Guest: It's not really to go and attend panels.

553
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:49,100
Guest: Yeah, you can do that, but isn't the real purpose of being here to do something you normally can't, to be an otaku amongst otaku, to be amongst your own people?

554
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,760
Guest: And yet here we are in a state where our own people are being repressed from within.

555
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:57,200
Guest: I hate using words like that, but it's no less true.

556
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:05,860
Guest: The powers that be have taken it upon themselves to impose restrictions on something that they are supposed to be supporting and defending.

557
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:11,351
Guest: I'm not saying that it is our fundamental right for an artist's alley, but as part of Otakon, it's integral.

558
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:13,400
Guest: It's like trying to live without a liver.

559
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:15,379
Guest: You can do it, but it ain't going to be fun.

560
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:26,460
Rym: Well, I guess since we want to wrap this up at some point, I'd like to ask you in regarding the Save Artist Alley live journal community, what can we do?

561
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:35,120
Rym: What can concern fans who want to express similarly their disagreement with Otakon's policy or any sort of disagreement with this in general?

562
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,067
Rym: So what can they do?

563
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:37,840
Rym: What is Save Artist Alley doing?

564
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,680
Guest: Well, first of all, Save Artist Alley has a couple of things going on at this time.

565
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:48,566
Guest: We are trying to get together a sort of modus operandi, who we are, what we really want to do, and how we are going to go about it.

566
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:56,040
Guest: I suggested a couple of things including, first off, trying to engage Otacorp Incorporated as paying members.

567
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,920
Guest: When you sign up for Otakon, you are not just signing up for an event.

568
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,380
Guest: Under the regulations of the Baltimore Convention Center, we are members of Otacorp.

569
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:04,667
Guest: We are coming for a big meeting.

570
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:12,852
Guest: And as shareholders, if you want to use that term, we have a right to understand what is going on with our Board of Directors, and we have a right to make changes, appeals,

571
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:13,415
Guest: etc.,

572
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:14,200
Guest: as we see fit.

573
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:33,600
Guest: What I want them to see with Save Artist Alley is an organized rational place where people can come together and assess their own abilities to put pressure on Otacorp, on the Board of Directors, on the Artist Alley people, in order to effect the change to restore Artist Alley to the state that it was in before this all came down.

574
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,152
Guest: What we are doing is setting up a single point of contact.

575
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:41,448
Guest: There is nothing really concrete as of yet, but we are getting petitions going.

576
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:47,031
Guest: We are even considering contacting the public relations groups for the industry in case this does come to it.

577
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:54,102
Guest: The last thing we want to do is call down thunder upon ourselves, but if it comes to it, we may very well need to go up to Funimation, a.d.v.

578
00:39:54,122 --> 00:40:06,451
Guest: Jimmy Onn, and say, "Hey, we would like for you to grant a license for anyone in this area of Otakon to make use of your intellectual property in the way that we see fit as artists, and we will engage the following conditions.

579
00:40:06,591 --> 00:40:08,220
Guest: We won't sell any of your stuff.

580
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,865
Guest: We are just going to do our own drawings,

581
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:10,287
Guest: etc.,

582
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:10,728
Guest: etc.".

583
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:22,294
Guest: If necessary, Save Artist Alley will become, and this is what I hope against, it will become a bulwark to where people can gather and actively put pressure on the powers that be.

584
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:23,318
Guest: I like Jim Bolz.

585
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,828
Guest: I like what he is doing to at least get things in line.

586
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:34,660
Guest: I don't believe he has anything to do with this policy decision, and I believe what he can do is understand that we are your people, Jim.

587
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,334
Guest: We are the ones that want to put money in this con's pockets.

588
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,740
Guest: We want to keep it strong.

589
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:45,380
Guest: We want to keep it fun, and we want to keep it the way it has been, because there has not been any reason to change.

590
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:50,339
Rym: A speech totally befitting of a member of the Communist Party of Anime.

591
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,780
Guest: Be well and everyone with your own, comrade.

592
00:40:54,161 --> 00:41:03,459
Rym: On that note, I'll say to all of our listeners out there that we are going to put a link to the Save Artist Alley Live Journal community in today's post, and thank you, Mike, for being here with us.

593
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,032
Guest: Guys, thanks for having me.

594
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:05,640
Guest: It's been a pleasure.

595
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,100
Rym: Alright, now that the audio quality is back to normal, I'd like to thank Mike for being with us.

596
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,120
Rym: I thought that was a very interesting interview, and we'd like to have him on the show again.

597
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:17,200
Scott: Yeah, that went a lot better than I could have possibly imagined.

598
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:26,007
Rym: Actually, if all of you have never tried this, it's very difficult to have a conversation with more than two people over a phone, because there's just so little audio bandwidth.

599
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:31,399
Rym: It's really hard to hear when someone's talking or interrupting, and it was kind of a challenge for us.

600
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:38,260
Scott: Yeah, but it wouldn't have even been possible without the use of the teleconferencing bridge that my company owns.

601
00:41:39,222 --> 00:41:42,100
Scott: It's very cool and has a web interface and all kinds of other cool stuff.

602
00:41:42,462 --> 00:41:44,960
Rym: Yep, though in the long run, we'll look into better ways.

603
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,700
Rym: Like, if we ever interview Mike again, he doesn't live that far from us, so we'll go do it live.

604
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:56,960
Scott: Yeah, and maybe if we call the bridge with Skype and microphones, instead of using everyone on their cell phone, it could work out a lot better.

605
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:05,980
Rym: Yeah, you can hear, I filtered what we did heavily, but my phone clips my voice out a lot harsher than his phone does.

606
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,840
Rym: I guess it speaks for the quality of a good cell phone.

607
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,620
Scott: Yeah, the raw recording was Rym real loud, Scott real loud, Mike real quiet.

608
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:15,360
Scott: And in the original recording, Mike sounded real good, and we sounded like ass.

609
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,680
Rym: So we still sound like ass, but at least it's quiet ass now, and you can actually hear what Mike's saying.

610
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,260
Scott: Yeah, that's what's important, because he was far more interesting than either of us.

611
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,700
Rym: Yeah, though we have some just final thoughts here and some bits that we wanted to talk about in some detail.

612
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:32,080
Rym: that would probably require you actually being able to hear my voice.

613
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,160
Rym: But we're not sure where this is going to go with Oticon.

614
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:49,878
Rym: I mean, this is all preliminary, and it exploded, and Jim made a statement very recently, I think it was this morning, saying that, basically, this is the end, no more debate, stop talking about it, we're going to release the official Oticon policy soon, and then you can debate it.

615
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:59,500
Rym: And the post, I'm not going to read the whole thing, it's kind of long, but he starts off by saying that Rachel Ann and I have both admitted that the way things were initially presented was confusing.

616
00:42:59,962 --> 00:43:01,430
Rym: Clearly a lot of people misread it.

617
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:03,280
Rym: If we had to do it over again, we'd have done it differently.

618
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,640
Scott: I don't know, I think they did some pretty good clarifications along the way.

619
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,724
Rym: Yeah, well here's the thing.

620
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:16,700
Rym: He says, and no offense to him, I think he's an awesome guy, but we are not banning all fan art at Oticon, not even within the artist alley, period.

621
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,700
Rym: And another staff member, JK, the Treasurer, says Oticon is not banning fan art.

622
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:32,540
Rym: And Rachel Ann, actually, in one of her later posts, says that, basically, she says that the rule was put in place.

623
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:39,760
Rym: so they can say that's the rule, legal, whatever, but wink, wink, nudge, nudge, it's only going to be enforced for egregious offenders.

624
00:43:40,581 --> 00:43:43,656
Rym: If you look in the threads, I don't want to really read all the quotes from her.

625
00:43:43,696 --> 00:43:46,104
Rym: I have that support this, but that's what she basically said.

626
00:43:46,164 --> 00:43:51,960
Rym: She listed eleven, I guess, things that are more important than enforcing this rule.

627
00:43:52,401 --> 00:44:08,180
Rym: And then she said, well we officially have to enforce copyright trademark laws, remember, I have to say this, and this list will probably give you an idea of, well, more clearly, give you an idea of where we'll be focused in terms of what we're going to enforce.

628
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:18,520
Scott: That sounds like a change of tune, because if you read the early posts, I mean, sure, okay, I can understand that, her saying that, if the only place that they said no fan art was the original statement.

629
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:23,900
Scott: But she went on in multiple posts afterwards, saying all kinds of things.

630
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,354
Rym: Yes, I mean, here she clarified what would be allowed.

631
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:28,520
Rym: Here's one.

632
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:34,056
Rym: Say I have placed a character in a different pose/background/situation than he would be found elsewhere.

633
00:44:34,478 --> 00:44:35,100
Rym: Not allowed.

634
00:44:36,642 --> 00:44:39,913
Rym: Uh, images copied directly from another source, not allowed.

635
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:41,880
Rym: Just a list of things that are specifically not allowed.

636
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:54,828
Scott: Now, if your stance was actually that you just had to say this and you weren't actually going to enforce it, and you just had to say it, then why would you have clarified with a specific list of things that are not allowed, including the things you said you weren't going to enforce?

637
00:44:54,848 --> 00:45:01,020
Scott: You would only have written that in the original and public policy, and not in many, many private messages in the forums.

638
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:05,620
Rym: Another one, chibis would not be allowed, they wouldn't be considered parody.

639
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,520
Rym: So if I take a character and draw him all cute, it says specifically that would not be allowed.

640
00:45:10,881 --> 00:45:17,120
Rym: The yaoi thing, like I mentioned we were talking to Mike, yaoi is not parody, but rather exploitation of a licensed copyrighted character.

641
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:17,722
Rym: You know what?

642
00:45:18,023 --> 00:45:22,080
Scott: I actually wouldn't mind if there was some sort of no yaoi rule.

643
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,751
Scott: Or at least some sort of yaoi restriction.

644
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:26,300
Scott: A yaoi restriction I think would be good.

645
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,127
Rym: Well, how about just a yaoi section?

646
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:33,246
Rym: Like, have an area of artist alley where you can say, "My art is explicit, I would like to be

647
00:45:33,286 --> 00:45:33,426
Rym: there.".

648
00:45:33,446 --> 00:45:37,520
Rym: Don't make it, like, don't enforce it as a rule, but make it an option.

649
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:46,440
Rym: Because, I mean, yaoi people and the people who are into it, they're usually really cool people, and they would probably want to put themselves in the yaoi section, if for nothing else, so the fan girls can find them.

650
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,940
Scott: In the art auction, they put the nasty stuff behind the barriers, hidden away, right?

651
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:59,313
Scott: Why don't they put the people with, you know, the artist alley tables that have that sort of thing in a different section, behind some walls or something like that, you know?

652
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:00,480
Scott: It's like, they're in with everyone else.

653
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,631
Scott: I'll be looking through people's art books, and I'll be like, "Yay!

654
00:46:03,651 --> 00:46:03,711
Scott: Yay!

655
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:04,353
Scott: Oh god!

656
00:46:04,454 --> 00:46:04,514
Scott: Oh

657
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:05,196
Scott: god!".

658
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,200
Scott: And that's right next to someone who's, like, got cute thingies for kiddies, you know?

659
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,411
Scott: They should separate the tables as well as the auction, I think.

660
00:46:13,993 --> 00:46:15,700
Scott: That would be an okay policy that I could live with.

661
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:24,240
Scott: Yeah, I think they're actually, they're being smart now that they realize they messed up, and I think they're gonna go ask the lawyer, and then that'll be that, whatever the lawyer says.

662
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:25,381
Rym: Yep.

663
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:44,960
Rym: So, I wouldn't be surprised if this policy gets reworded or completely thrown out or something, because honestly, it's my opinion that if Otakon goes forward with this as it's written, or in a similar form to as it's written, artist alley is not really going to exist as in a form that I really care about anymore.

664
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:57,160
Rym: So I guess the last thing I have to say here is that this is going to be an ongoing debate, and as I request in the forums, if any of you have anything to say about this, please send us audio feedback, email, post in the forums, something.

665
00:46:57,461 --> 00:47:01,500
Rym: We're going to do another episode on this where we'll take comments from anyone who's involved.

666
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,179
Rym: We want to get some comments from the Otakon staff if they have anything to say, from any artists out there.

667
00:47:06,882 --> 00:47:08,539
Rym: We really just want to hear what you have to say about this.

668
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,889
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

669
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,500
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

670
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,299
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

671
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,495
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

672
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:29,279
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

673
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:33,259
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

674
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,947
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

675
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,400
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

676
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,320
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

677
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,200
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
