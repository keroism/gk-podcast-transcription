1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,817
Rym: It's Thursday April 27th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,800
Rym: tonight We are going to discuss the Nintendo announcement that we just couldn't resist talking about.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,544
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:24,800
Scott: I like to personally thank Nintendo for making today's episode so easy.

5
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:30,020
Rym: Yeah, I mean there's really nothing else we could possibly do than talk about what we're about to talk about.

6
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:33,108
Scott: We really need a little counter in the bottom left.

7
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:37,380
Scott: for how many times we're gonna say the bottom left of what our video?

8
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:43,409
Rym: But yeah, yeah We've got some actual news.

9
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:45,238
Rym: news that isn't just.

10
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:54,092
Scott: you know Yeah, what the main topic of today's episode has to be by law yeah something We couldn't really wait until next Tuesday to talk about.

11
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:57,288
Rym: nope nope nope Yeah, so anyway.

12
00:00:57,328 --> 00:00:59,439
Rym: We'll try to get through this with this minimal.

13
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:05,784
Scott: You open the can of worms All Right.

14
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:14,133
Rym: so uh Yesterday on slashdot there was the thing about spyware and your spyware IQ and there's a little test where they would give you a bunch of sites.

15
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:20,950
Rym: you have to figure out which ones have spyware and which ones don't and The billing of it was that oh a lot of people can't tell the difference.

16
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,740
Rym: even techies are getting some of them wrong and who?

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:33,245
Rym: spyware is really bad and even if you're a professional you can't always pick it out I Pretty much complete bullshit.

18
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:35,395
Scott: Yeah, I mean what it does.

19
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:59,859
Scott: I took it this morning I think and it basically gives you a choice of two different websites similar websites that both provide a similar service and one of them always looks really snazzy and one of them always looks kind of like homegrown crap from like 1990 something and it says which one is spyware and which one is safe and One of them is spyware and one of them is safe.

20
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:05,773
Scott: But it's stupid because Only an idiot would go to either one of the sites.

21
00:02:06,054 --> 00:02:07,400
Rym: Yeah, I mean all the sites.

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,740
Rym: They pose their things like get free screen savers or freeware applications for your computer.

23
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:22,300
Scott: Yep, and while some site fonts that offer free screen savers are not spyware You should never go to a stupid website giving free screen savers.

24
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:31,350
Rym: Yeah if you're going to a website like that spyware or not you deserve spyware and you're probably gonna get it because 99% of sites like that are spyware sites.

25
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:37,520
Scott: Yeah, so I mean I was ready to be like I don't trust either one of these sites and there was not an option.

26
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:54,700
Rym: Yeah I'm reasonably certain that this whole thing about the quiz is part of a run-up for an advertising campaign trying to Get people to buy various anti spyware applications when in reality All you have to do is either one not use Windows to at least not use IE or three not go to bad websites.

27
00:02:55,541 --> 00:03:00,240
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing was given by like McAfee, what do you want?

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,513
Rym: I mean, what's with people going to those crappy websites?

29
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:03,660
Rym: I can't believe there's still people.

30
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,547
Rym: I mean, it's like people who go to I don't know.

31
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:08,278
Scott: anime wallpapers calm and all papers that comes.

32
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:11,791
Rym: Okay It's alright, but if you ever been there without full of ads.

33
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,280
Scott: Yeah, if you don't go with an ad blocker you're in for trouble.

34
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:19,238
Rym: Yeah, or like anime cubed or all those sites that just have pictures from anime.

35
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,799
Rym: Mm-hmm I'll give you a little hint here Google Images.

36
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:24,951
Rym: Yep, you'll find the same thing.

37
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,620
Rym: In fact better two more two more.

38
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:39,684
Scott: Okay, so I'm not gonna go through all the details of this incredibly stupid news story that's been going around today But I want to talk about it only because I want to talk about something else related We we.

39
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:44,220
Scott: there's a guy who got in big trouble for hacking into the government computers.

40
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,158
Scott: Apparently it was some big hack job like the biggest ever and there are all these windows boxes that were completely unsecured, etc, etc.

41
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:59,366
Rym: Yep, and I mean I would like to say that if he were looking for some information that was more relevant to the world or some Sort of good thing.

42
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,157
Rym: I would have been much more in favor of him.

43
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,824
Scott: Yep He was looking for information about aliens and shit because he's a nutcase I'm gonna say right now.

44
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:12,300
Rym: It is possible that there is life out there somewhere in space in fact probable.

45
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:16,559
Rym: However, they are not coming to earth and abducting you.

46
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:18,310
Scott: No, no, they're not.

47
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:25,153
Rym: if they were someone would have noticed I mean Someone would have a picture of a spaceship.

48
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:26,400
Scott: That wasn't blurry.

49
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,543
Rym: Yeah, I mean think about it way back when the UFO craze started which incidentally was right after work right around right after World War II.

50
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:36,298
Scott: I mean think about this.

51
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:42,600
Scott: I was into the UFO thing when I was younger so was I and then I realized oh, this is just stupid.

52
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:50,820
Rym: Well what it came down to the fact that all right a long time ago There not many people had good cameras and cameras were shitty and it was hard to disseminate that sort of information.

53
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:58,997
Rym: nowadays Everyone in this civilized world has a camera with them or near them or someone near them as a camera.

54
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:00,040
Rym: their cameras everywhere.

55
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,560
Rym: The cameras are high quality.

56
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:07,099
Rym: There are lots of people all over the place yet the only people who ever get abducted by aliens are crazy people.

57
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:14,780
Scott: Don't you think that you know news stations have had cameras in trucks high quality cameras and trucks with live broadcast?

58
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,830
Scott: Capabilities for over three decades, I think.

59
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:25,795
Scott: oh and let me tell you and they have never ever Taken a video of an alien or UFO or anything like that.

60
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:39,260
Rym: and if you think it's some sort of conspiracy I can tell you right now that any one of those reporters would kill Absolutely kill to have video of a UFO and no amount of conspiracy BS would have stopped them.

61
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:53,312
Scott: Yeah, if you're the local TV station schmuck who manages to drive out into the woods and catch the alien You know eating some cows On your camera and you broadcast it on live TV.

62
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:53,794
Scott: Guess what?

63
00:05:53,834 --> 00:06:02,117
Scott: tomorrow you're in New York, so Everyone wants to videotape aliens and they haven't there aren't any if you believe in them.

64
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:03,240
Scott: You're a nutcase.

65
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:04,679
Rym: Yeah, well, no, they might be out there.

66
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:16,942
Scott: But yeah if you believe they're coming here and fucking with human if you believe they're a little green men and that alien abduction video is Real and that there was something crazy in Roswell besides weather balloons and Air Force projects Etc.

67
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,426
Scott: You got a problem.

68
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:25,460
Rym: Yeah, also note that a quote alien sightings have been decreasing as communication and technology have increased.

69
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,482
Scott: huh.

70
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:41,840
Rym: Also, I actually Bill Cosby did a good bit on this in the 80s in his stand-up really where he talked a lot about UFO Sightings and he said something along the lines of you never run into you know, a businessman or a scientist who saw an alien.

71
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:46,820
Rym: Yes, I was sitting there drinking my martini with my wife and I saw an alien.

72
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:49,699
Rym: They came down and they said hello to me and then they left.

73
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:53,860
Rym: It's always some redneck or some crazy, dude.

74
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:55,685
Rym: Yeah, I have to.

75
00:06:55,725 --> 00:07:00,076
Rym: I had like nine beers and then I got abducted by an alien.

76
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,384
Rym: They gave me some chicklets It's true.

77
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:03,650
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

78
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:05,600
Rym: and then they gave me a chicklet.

79
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:11,540
Rym: If I can find it because I got a cassette tape of it somewhere I'll play it on the air.

80
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:12,782
Rym: Right be damned.

81
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:13,885
Scott: All right.

82
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:14,326
Scott: All right.

83
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:19,440
Scott: So yeah this guy I say give him the full brunt of the hacking punishment.

84
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:22,613
Rym: Yeah, it's not like he was doing anything good like trying to expose.

85
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:24,039
Rym: Hey, look the war was a sham.

86
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:24,721
Scott: now Here's the thing.

87
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:28,813
Scott: The guy had some pretty specific claims say about alien information.

88
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:31,500
Scott: He found either a he's lying.

89
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:38,540
Scott: B there's some stupid people in the government posting that sort of stuff and it's not true, which I wouldn't surprise me at all.

90
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:45,987
Scott: See he misinterpreted it, you know, there's a whole bunch of possibilities But I really don't think any of them are.

91
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,111
Scott: oh my god, there's aliens.

92
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:49,540
Scott: even the comments on dig there.

93
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,991
Scott: I don't think there was a single comment that was like yeah, there's aliens.

94
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:55,600
Scott: This guy is totally gonna bust open the conspiracy.

95
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,144
Rym: Oh my god, well look at our government.

96
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:01,356
Rym: our government couldn't handle the disaster relief of one city in New Orleans.

97
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:04,428
Rym: I don't think they could.

98
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,156
Rym: for over a period of more than 50 years.

99
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:10,593
Scott: They couldn't keep their evil prison camps in Europe a secret.

100
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,560
Scott: They couldn't keep Guantanamo Bay a secret.

101
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,660
Scott: They couldn't keep anything a fucking secret.

102
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:22,386
Scott: They're not gonna keep the fucking aliens from outer space that you can't possibly miss and have laser beams and abduction Technologies a secret.

103
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,370
Scott: there's no way.

104
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,912
Scott: you know why?

105
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:24,615
Rym: wait, you know what?

106
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,020
Rym: a lot of people have telescopes.

107
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:31,220
Rym: A lot of people are looking for stuff telescopes like the Hubble telescope.

108
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,460
Scott: Yeah, if there were aliens they would have seen it.

109
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,616
Scott: They had that SETI thing which is actually not the worst thing in the world.

110
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:39,926
Scott: if there were aliens They would have fucking found them.

111
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:43,698
Rym: Yeah, or they're too far away for us to really care other than knowing that they're there.

112
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,013
Scott: Yeah, so

113
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:58,487
Rym: honestly It's my belief or at least my opinion that I wouldn't be surprised if we discover intelligent life out there possibly with our lifetimes You know with SETI and all that but at best it would be a the best we could get is yes There is intelligence out there.

114
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,279
Rym: It is too far away to ever reach.

115
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:10,257
Scott: Yeah, the fact that we haven't encountered some sort of Intelligent life yet tells me one of two things.

116
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:19,673
Scott: one The universe is so incredibly vast that the odds of anyone finding us is like one in a trillion jajillion years or even the odds Of anyone finding anyone.

117
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:27,529
Scott: Yeah - there really isn't possible to make some sort of transportation technology akin to hyperspace.

118
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:27,750
Scott: or.

119
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:35,089
Scott: Three the universe is really so young that we're like the first intelligent race and the other ones haven't come around yet.

120
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:45,970
Scott: I always read like sci-fi stories about the precursors that were like the earliest race that had the best technology And then all the other races came way after we could be the precursors for all we know.

121
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:54,480
Rym: It's like episode one of Futurama where the cities get destroyed by the aliens and then castles get rebuilt And then the castles get destroyed by the aliens and then cities get rebuilt.

122
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:55,222
Scott: Yep.

123
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:56,145
Scott: Yeah.

124
00:09:56,506 --> 00:10:09,014
Scott: All right, so aliens crazy I Alright.

125
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:12,290
Rym: so Scott you can do your thing of the day first since mine is ancient and relevant.

126
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,522
Scott: Yeah, and as soon as my thing of the day is done.

127
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:20,322
Scott: We're gonna open up a big can of Keep that can close for now.

128
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:21,390
Scott: We why?

129
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,490
Scott: Why?

130
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:24,612
Rym: My why?

131
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:25,415
Scott: All right.

132
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:28,430
Scott: So there's a cool blog I discovered today.

133
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,906
Scott: It seems a pretty old blog but it also seems to be a frequently updated blog.

134
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:32,649
Scott: So it's all good.

135
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:41,071
Scott: the blog puts up clips from YouTube and Google video and whatnot of Japanese TV shows.

136
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:43,477
Scott: and wow Japan.

137
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:48,368
Scott: yeah Wow like I've seen some Japanese TV.

138
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:51,961
Scott: like you know some morning Musume about Takashi's castle.

139
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:53,949
Scott: yeah I've seen some stuff around.

140
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,037
Scott: you know mostly anime but other stuff also.

141
00:10:56,719 --> 00:11:07,022
Rym: this guy finds the best of the best clips from stuff like if you thought morning Musume versus the lizard was funny or weird that's got nothing on some of this.

142
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:14,208
Scott: yeah if you thought that like Yatta was like the be all end all yeah yeah you got nothing.

143
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:17,304
Scott: compared to the things this guy is finding on a daily basis.

144
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:19,977
Rym: what was the one you watched just before we did the show about Chucky.

145
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:21,263
Scott: it was just.

146
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:22,107
Scott: it was just.

147
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:33,149
Scott: someone came out of a booth doing a poor impersonation of Chucky while they were basically like jittering like someone with that disease that makes you jitter all over the place.

148
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:39,063
Scott: Wow and I was just like what the hell is going on here.

149
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:47,980
Scott: so if you would like to laugh at funny Japanese TV you should probably subscribe to the RSS feed for this blog and check out all their stuffs.

150
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:52,740
Rym: yeah I'll warn you that this site may become a future source of possible things of the day.

151
00:11:52,760 --> 00:12:05,736
Scott: yeah that's I decided to use it as the thing of the day as opposed to picking out one or two things because then I would just for the next like year just pick out yeah that guy's blog would be basically the thing of the day.

152
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:08,946
Scott: blog wouldn't be good all right.

153
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:13,387
Rym: so today we're going to talk about the Wii and my thing of the day.

154
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:14,434
Rym: I had this other thing of the day.

155
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:19,260
Rym: I've said a couple times about some World War one stuff but whatever this thing of the day is ancient.

156
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:21,509
Rym: I mean ancient ancient.

157
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,572
Rym: this is an ancient ancient ancient I want to keep saying ancient part of internet history.

158
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:35,450
Rym: we found it under the pyramids this is and next to the temple in Israel this is so old that I had not actually heard or seen it in at least three years.

159
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:44,323
Rym: yeah despite this it was the first thing the very first thing that came to my mind when I heard what Nintendo called the revolution.

160
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:51,512
Scott: you were not alone as there are links abound in every thread I saw any place the comments could be posted about.

161
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:55,142
Scott: I saw the link posted to the old.

162
00:12:56,545 --> 00:13:02,151
Rym: so I'm not going to assume that you've all seen this because I realized that we're kind of the old man of the internet.

163
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,615
Rym: now mm-hmm.

164
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:09,451
Rym: so gonads and strife gonna tend to lightning gonads in the rain.

165
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:11,535
Scott: all right it's a video somewhat of a video.

166
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:12,837
Rym: it's more like a flash.

167
00:13:12,878 --> 00:13:33,865
Rym: it's in the all your base or whatever the hell that was and it appeared a long long time ago and it was one of those things that you'd like go to new grounds and watch back with like stick death that kind of internet humor.

168
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:46,515
Rym: e bombs world stylin yeah old e bombs world like back in the day yTMD and I'm surprised that everyone in the world seemed to remember it suddenly when the name of the revolution was announced.

169
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,514
Scott: I wonder how many people today discovered this for the first time ever.

170
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:57,965
Rym: yeah in fact tell us if if you had never seen the gonads and strife video until I linked to it tonight I talked.

171
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,472
Rym: tell us I really want to know.

172
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:00,823
Rym: maybe we'll make it a poll or something.

173
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:03,820
Scott: tell us what you think about it because this is like ancient.

174
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:07,457
Scott: there would be no things of the day if it weren't for things like this back in the day.

175
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:09,284
Rym: a good way to put it.

176
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:13,011
Rym: so without further ado let's talk about the we.

177
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:33,439
Scott: for those of you who do not know the Nintendo revolution is not going to be called the Nintendo revolution.

178
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:36,779
Scott: we have known and have always known that is only the code name.

179
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:40,644
Rym: yes there but there's been a lot of speculation as to what it was actually going to be called.

180
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:42,677
Rym: some people said was going to be called the revolution.

181
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:46,133
Rym: anyway some people said the Nintendo go was a good idea.

182
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:49,767
Scott: some people came up with a bunch of random ideas all over the place.

183
00:14:50,510 --> 00:15:04,650
Scott: whatever today it was we're a hundred percent sure because I went to the official Nintendo website before it was down and I went to the official Nintendo Japanese website just before the show and checked to make sure we weren't insane.

184
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,491
Scott: the Nintendo revolution is really going to be called the Nintendo we.

185
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:23,030
Rym: now there was some debate initially as to whether it was pronounced why or we why to which I say if you think it was pronounced why why you're dumb yes it was called.

186
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,012
Scott: it is called we.

187
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:31,290
Scott: why as in you and me or Rym and I we?

188
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:38,918
Rym: yeah now the thing is Nintendo really gave a whole bunch of clever answers like oh we'll see we look two eyes.

189
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:49,049
Rym: it's like two people sitting there playing the game but it's also we as in we are going to enjoy the game together and and all these sorts of you know very Japanese type ooh look clever wordplay.

190
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,745
Scott: the eye looks like the controller but it can also be a person but it can't.

191
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:53,909
Scott: oh look at that.

192
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:57,421
Scott: ooh this and I see why they picked we.

193
00:15:57,502 --> 00:16:02,118
Scott: it's because number one a lot of things have the letter I in them.

194
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:04,385
Rym: I Mac Wi-Fi did that.

195
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:10,521
Rym: if I thing if I buy whatever the hell it was if I was just DRM.

196
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:13,871
Scott: yeah so the letter I is real popular.

197
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:28,644
Scott: iPod yes and Nintendo is trying to sell this product not to the people who are PlayStation Xbox II but to everyone else and things with names like this TiVo seem to be selling to just about everyone.

198
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:29,851
Rym: yes this strategy.

199
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:30,796
Rym: we talked about it before.

200
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:34,437
Scott: they call it blue water and that well they called it the blue ocean strategy.

201
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:42,504
Scott: I think we're gonna change the yellow ocean strategy but we all right in French when you want to say yes you say we we.

202
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,368
Rym: you gotta be kidding me.

203
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:47,395
Rym: oh my god that is hysterical.

204
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:53,752
Rym: what do you say for no doo-doo I'll be right back.

205
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:54,755
Scott: I gotta go take a wicked.

206
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:57,104
Scott: yes there goes the what there goes.

207
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,357
Scott: one joke off my little list of jokes I wrote today.

208
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:05,849
Rym: oh my god I couldn't talk about this with my co-workers because not only would they not have understood but I probably would have just been annoying.

209
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:12,259
Scott: yes so the reason I think Nintendo picked is because it's such a flexible idea.

210
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,354
Scott: the problem with the idea is that it's not inspiring.

211
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:18,281
Scott: like you could sit around going.

212
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,113
Scott: yeah I'm gonna get the revolution all right.

213
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:21,339
Scott: you can't sit around going.

214
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:23,146
Scott: yeah I can't wait to get the Wii.

215
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,134
Scott: it just doesn't is?

216
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:27,564
Scott: it doesn't have passion behind the name.

217
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:29,131
Rym: yeah I mean I had.

218
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:36,945
Rym: I just had these visions of when the revolution of like a kid Che Guevara style holding the controller over his head as other kids rush forward.

219
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:38,834
Rym: but now I don't get that with Wii.

220
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:46,089
Scott: yeah the problem is is that even if we got revolution revolution doesn't really appeal to anyone but us cool gamer types.

221
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,000
Scott: yeah my mom doesn't want to buy the revolution.

222
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,364
Scott: my mom might buy the Wii.

223
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:51,808
Scott: you know it's.

224
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,716
Scott: it's a brand that what they?

225
00:17:55,639 --> 00:18:07,842
Rym: the brand sacrifices the passion of the gamer for the acceptance of more people which is possibly okay because it's kind of like the story of capstone at RIT little geek fable.

226
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:21,697
Rym: here there were a whole bunch of apartments that they're building nice ones at our campus and they were still constructing them while we went there and the year before we attended RIT they were like a twinkle in some fat old man's eye and they didn't say what they were gonna be called yet.

227
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:27,225
Rym: but there were these construction crews building them and the construction company was called capstone mm-hmm.

228
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:30,678
Rym: so everyone called the new apartments the capstones mm-hmm.

229
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:38,190
Rym: then the apartments were unveiled and they were called University Commons and for many people called them capstone.

230
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:47,504
Rym: yes everyone who was old enough to know better or new people who were old enough to know better called them capstone and you could tell the people who were kind of out of the loop socially because they called it University Commons.

231
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:53,969
Scott: yes also at RIT the group that performed maintenance was known as physical plant.

232
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,235
Rym: that's a very nice name.

233
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,486
Rym: I like names like that physical physical plant.

234
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:59,255
Scott: that's an awesome name physical plant.

235
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:07,290
Scott: then like our last year there or the two years before I graduated they changed the name to what FMS facilities management.

236
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:08,957
Rym: yeah I actually forgot what it was.

237
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:09,017
Rym: it

238
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,440
Scott: doesn't matter I kept calling them physical plant and whether they liked it or not

239
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:27,796
Rym: yeah they didn't like it because I often had to interface with various people on campus you know requesting services and all that and I'd always ask for a physical plant stuff and they'd give me this glare like physical plant doesn't exist anymore and I'd stare him right back down can't?

240
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:29,041
Rym: does I need a freaking janitor?

241
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:37,585
Scott: janitors from physical plant not maintenance laborers from facilities management services?

242
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,474
Rym: yeah yeah physical plant.

243
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:41,638
Rym: we go on and on about that.

244
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,688
Rym: but I see that happening with the revolution.

245
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:49,457
Rym: I think a lot of people at least hardcore Nintendo fans are going to continue to call it the revolution forever.

246
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,775
Scott: it's weird because they've had code names for every system so far.

247
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:58,884
Scott: we had dolphin dolphin the ultra 64 and people just gave up the code names and a lot of them are forgotten.

248
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:01,399
Scott: I don't think the revolution name is going to be forgot.

249
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,320
Rym: I think part of it was that every other system Nintendo released I mean dolphin.

250
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:09,581
Rym: the GameCube was the first one where it was widely known before the system came out.

251
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:18,820
Rym: before then the internet wasn't so ubiquitous and like when the SNES came out no one in America knew what the code name was for it except some developers.

252
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:20,365
Scott: no one really cared either.

253
00:20:20,826 --> 00:20:23,596
Rym: yeah and even the n64 no one knew.

254
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:24,960
Rym: revel our GameCube.

255
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,796
Rym: people started to know but they heard GameCube before they heard dolphin.

256
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:29,759
Scott: mm-hmm.

257
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:31,410
Scott: I heard dolphin before I heard game.

258
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,000
Rym: yeah but most people didn't hear dolphin.

259
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,784
Rym: dolphin wasn't.

260
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:34,911
Scott: dolphin was the thing.

261
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:43,612
Scott: dolphin was the thing you hear if you read video game magazines and video game website yep which many people don't revolution they use that name a lot more.

262
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:47,891
Scott: in fact there was like a revolution link at the top of the Nintendo website plus.

263
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:52,834
Rym: Nintendo talked about the revolution a lot I mean before the n64 was really announced.

264
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:54,863
Rym: they didn't talk about it much at most.

265
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:57,796
Rym: they'd mentioned you know a new console is coming someday.

266
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:03,040
Scott: yeah there wasn't really a whole lot of Nintendo wasn't generating buzz about the dolphin.

267
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:12,964
Scott: they were just saying you were coming up with a new console the code name is dolphin and then they didn't generate buzz until they actually had you know the GameCube.

268
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:14,351
Scott: then they started generating buzz.

269
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:24,849
Scott: Nintendo here has been generating buzz about the revolution for so long and now they changed the name to Wii right before they announce it.

270
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:33,100
Scott: whereas you look at Microsoft or PlayStation they had their names set in stone long before their big reveals.

271
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:37,704
Scott: well ps3 still hasn't been revealed but like PlayStation portable they had the name right away.

272
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:40,943
Scott: there was no code name for that because their names are just straightforward and stupid.

273
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:45,197
Scott: but Xbox 360 like right away Xbox 360.

274
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:54,569
Rym: I mean I guess my only real fear here of the Wii Wii is not our silliness because this is what you would expect from you know Nintendo fans.

275
00:21:55,313 --> 00:22:01,826
Rym: I worry that the word just doesn't really seem to resonate with American sensibilities and American speaking patterns.

276
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:05,342
Scott: it all depends on their marketing because oh it does heavily.

277
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:13,739
Rym: but I just I note that revolution is a word in English that just feels good to Americans yeah but it doesn't really feel good to grandma.

278
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,442
Rym: no it doesn't.

279
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:23,962
Rym: but at the same time or mommy I just I see that Americans tend to not like words that sound foreign or different or look weird or spelled weirdly.

280
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:32,592
Scott: yeah well there's an interview and we link to with we public relations guy for Nintendo and the game informer.

281
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:35,022
Scott: people actually seem to have some balls in this interview.

282
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:39,075
Rym: yeah they basically asked so uh we we we P?

283
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:41,201
Rym: yeah what's the deal?

284
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:48,168
Scott: so the guys like plenty of people have things named like TiVo and Napster and all sorts of weird names.

285
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:53,186
Scott: Nestle yeah and those all things get credit and credibility.

286
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,356
Scott: Virgin Airlines no one makes jokes about that.

287
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,448
Scott: you know Virgin Mobile caterpillar.

288
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:01,157
Rym: how could you make fun of caterpillar?

289
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:01,800
Scott: I don't know.

290
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:03,428
Rym: there's no naked juice.

291
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,137
Scott: there's naked juice you buy in the store.

292
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:06,804
Rym: I made fun of that the first time I saw it.

293
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,430
Rym: yeah in fact it was at Otakon.

294
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,237
Scott: Yahoo you know.

295
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:14,579
Scott: he uses all these examples of other companies with weird names and how.

296
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,640
Scott: no one really makes fun of those once they validate themselves in the marketplace.

297
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:31,170
Scott: yeah and he's probably right that eventually the Wii jokes will run out but not for a while not on your life.

298
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,697
Scott: but Nintendo was smart in that.

299
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:38,696
Scott: the reason they announced the Wii now as opposed to at e3 is that way.

300
00:23:38,716 --> 00:23:42,634
Scott: at e3 people are concentrating on the names the games and not the names.

301
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:46,070
Rym: yeah I really still expect them to drop some sort of bomb at e3.

302
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:50,008
Scott: oh man they're gonna be Bob arms with parachutes all over the shizzy.

303
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:50,269
Rym: I could.

304
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:52,860
Rym: just I can imagine what I really know.

305
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:04,315
Rym: I can't imagine what kind of announcement they would make but there's got yes connection God and holy crap because there's got to be at least one more like secret that we don't know about the revolution.

306
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:10,630
Scott: I guarantee there's like a whole shit ton of secrets and they're gonna bust them all out like in a row and whoever's there is gonna be like.

307
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,545
Scott: they're gonna say one thing oh my god another thing oh my god.

308
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,381
Scott: and then at the end they're gonna say oh we forgot to say this.

309
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:20,511
Rym: I mean like in the interview.

310
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:24,744
Rym: it was great because they at one point the guy asks.

311
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:35,595
Rym: so we heard a rumor that the one of the secret features coming that's going to be announced is that the nunchuck part of the controller is also a motion sensor and the guy answers with really that's interesting.

312
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:40,513
Scott: yeah we've heard a lot of speculation some of it true some of it not.

313
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:47,003
Rym: I remember when the GameCube was coming out and people were speculating whether or not it would come with a holographic projector.

314
00:24:47,504 --> 00:24:56,912
Scott: oh yeah yeah oh no I think that was original revolution before we even knew it was a controller.

315
00:24:56,932 --> 00:24:58,198
Rym: that was a long time ago.

316
00:24:58,218 --> 00:24:59,083
Scott: yeah that was.

317
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:04,486
Scott: that was original revolution speculation actually not GameCube speculation if I recall correctly.

318
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:07,555
Rym: yeah IIRC.

319
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:12,412
Scott: but I'll repeat something I also saw in many forums you know arose by any other name.

320
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:19,709
Scott: the name we which we can talk about for now until the end of time does not diminish the awesomeness that the revolution will undoubtedly be.

321
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,634
Rym: no it does not.

322
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,146
Scott: it's funny because I'm referring it to his revolution now.

323
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:27,625
Scott: and so is the Nintendo guy like he didn't actually say we.

324
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:30,260
Scott: he said once you touch the revolution this will make more sense.

325
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,360
Scott: well shouldn't he have said once you touch the we this will make more sense.

326
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,890
Rym: because he asked them to touch his we he might go to jail.

327
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,902
Scott: I know it's so terrific about this thing.

328
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:52,851
Rym: so uh Scott when it comes out you want to stay in our house and play with our we all day you kidding I won't be going anywhere without my we all right let's start talking about.

329
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:54,417
Scott: there's my list of things here.

330
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:55,865
Rym: oh yeah Scott made a list.

331
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:58,057
Rym: I was doing work at work and apparently Scott wasn't.

332
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:01,468
Scott: every time something new came to my mind about the we I wrote it down.

333
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:11,444
Rym: well there are the nights who say we we Xbox alright.

334
00:26:12,386 --> 00:26:16,216
Scott: so first of all where do you think they came up with the name we?

335
00:26:16,276 --> 00:26:17,804
Scott: well according to the interview whatever.

336
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:23,247
Scott: but I think that some guy was playing picto chat with his DS and he got a message.

337
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:26,924
Scott: you know the typical message you get on picto chat and he said that's it.

338
00:26:27,728 --> 00:26:29,397
Scott: in fact that's what we'll call the next system.

339
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:30,502
Rym: that's beyond.

340
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:34,339
Rym: I mean that's like since an ACK ACK in CCP IP.

341
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:36,729
Rym: that's like the standard greeting of two guys with DS's.

342
00:26:37,151 --> 00:26:38,637
Rym: it's the DS comes on.

343
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:41,289
Rym: you have joined picto chat a picture of a penis.

344
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:44,321
Rym: I must respond with a better picture of a penis and then you can talk.

345
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:50,454
Scott: yep that guy must have realized but everyone was doing a picto chat and he said I know people love penises.

346
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,383
Scott: we'll use penises to sell our system.

347
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:53,167
Scott: we'll call it the we.

348
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:55,298
Rym: well the controller is shaped rather fallically.

349
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,414
Rym: it is granted I hate people who say something's a phallic symbol because I'll note that many things are vaguely cylindrical.

350
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:05,278
Scott: you know if you take the lowercase I and turn it upside down it looks like a penis with one nut.

351
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,214
Rym: if you turn it right side up it's an ejaculating penis.

352
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:10,442
Scott: whoo all right.

353
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:15,197
Scott: secondly you know how for the DS they come up with games like Mario DS Tetris DS.

354
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:26,866
Scott: we're gonna get Mario we princess between huh Tetris with that controller Wario we Tetris Wario we Kirby we.

355
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:29,614
Scott: it's like a cong we.

356
00:27:30,237 --> 00:27:32,587
Rym: somewhere on FARC someone referred to all will rights.

357
00:27:32,788 --> 00:27:40,136
Rym: P alright P on us will right?

358
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:40,919
Rym: yeah oh.

359
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:54,815
Scott: I wanted to point out also how while the name may not be a good name you know in terms of many things at least in terms of the fact that it didn't immediately like resonate with the masses there it does have an advantage.

360
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:56,825
Scott: that is rather obvious now.

361
00:27:56,905 --> 00:28:00,306
Scott: if they would have just said we're gonna keep the name revolution everyone would have gone.

362
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:01,757
Scott: yeah they're keeping the name revolution.

363
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:02,301
Scott: that would have been it.

364
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:07,232
Scott: if they would have said we're gonna use Nintendo go everyone would have said yeah they picked the one that we liked.

365
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:13,938
Scott: we're good because they picked we which wasn't something that people like really like to ride away.

366
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:19,398
Scott: it caused an internet explosion and I think Nintendo knew that right out.

367
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:24,420
Scott: that's why they did it because they knew it would cause an internet explosion right before e3.

368
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:26,470
Scott: they did it on purpose and it worked.

369
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:28,458
Scott: no press is bad press.

370
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:30,225
Rym: yes all publicity is good publicity.

371
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:36,855
Scott: why do you think the Nintendo PR guy was ready with an interview with Game Informer on the same damn day.

372
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:38,520
Scott: come on people.

373
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:41,088
Scott: they did it on purpose and it's working.

374
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:47,501
Scott: the fact that we're doing a whole podcast about it and we're not being paid by Nintendo shows that it's working really really.

375
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:49,732
Rym: you should have heard us when we came home from work.

376
00:28:49,893 --> 00:29:03,565
Rym: I walked in the door and I heard we and I walk upstairs and I go and I ran into a house and there's a guy all right.

377
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:08,179
Scott: secondly a lot of people were saying okay it's only the name in Japan.

378
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:09,627
Scott: well no it's the name everywhere.

379
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:16,957
Scott: in fact the Japanese website has the exact same flash video that the American website has yep.

380
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:26,542
Rym: and now they even said that part of the reason they picked this name is that it's language neutral and that you can call it the same thing worldwide and it's going to be part of a global branding campaign.

381
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:31,467
Scott: that's good because previous Nintendo things did not have the same brand globally.

382
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:36,725
Scott: I mean the DS and the GameCube did but not the Famicom or the Super Famicom.

383
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:40,822
Scott: yeah it's really a new thing to have the same name globally for Nintendo.

384
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:51,706
Scott: I mean some Nintendo games don't even have the same name on both sides of the world so giving their system the same name on both I mean mother earthbound yeah yeah.

385
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:54,944
Scott: so giving it the same name everywhere is really gonna help them out.

386
00:29:54,984 --> 00:29:58,983
Rym: speaking of which isn't mother three out in Japan it's out for the GBA in Japan.

387
00:29:59,003 --> 00:29:59,766
Rym: it's not fair.

388
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:10,728
Scott: ah you bastards yeah so I just noticed though if they're gonna use the same name worldwide that's fine but the name has different meanings worldwide.

389
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:12,717
Scott: in France it means a wee wee.

390
00:30:13,722 --> 00:30:23,149
Scott: well no it means yes but and in Ireland and Scotland it means oh it's a wee leprechaun.

391
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:28,312
Scott: you got there huh what that was a nice mixture of Scottish and Irish I know I know I went for it.

392
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:30,399
Rym: huh Willie's got a wee.

393
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,710
Scott: Willie as a wee bit a gaming console.

394
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,291
Scott: you got there.

395
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:41,330
Rym: okay anywhere anyone else you want to make fun it's a wee wee I got.

396
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,373
Rym: anyone else you gonna make fun of here.

397
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:51,986
Scott: okay so yeah do we?

398
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:54,572
Rym: I'm not sure what I think yet

399
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:58,787
Scott: I think that's the idea is that they want you to think

400
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:12,762
Rym: yeah if anything they threw me off guard because I saw the earliest earliest like cutting bleeding-edge news if it's gonna be called the Wii and it says something that usually when I get cutting news like that you can't you have this bullshit filter of alright

401
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:16,605
Scott: that immediately I thought it was bullshit because I first saw it at an unreputable source.

402
00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:20,142
Scott: yeah and I went straight to nintendo.com and clicked revolution.

403
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:24,984
Scott: and there it was and I was like well now it went from 0% true to 100% true in about 30 seconds.

404
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:29,854
Rym: usually I'm really good about that like I'll see a story and I think all right this is obviously bullshit.

405
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:36,767
Rym: I'll wait for someone to retract it or I'll wait for someone to prove this wrong or debunk it or I'll see something all right.

406
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,697
Rym: that's probably legitimate this one.

407
00:31:38,718 --> 00:31:43,765
Rym: I immediately there's no way that could be true I thought wow someone just made up a funny word and tried to make a rumor.

408
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,837
Scott: within one minute it was verified as 100% true.

409
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,165
Scott: one minute I want to.

410
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,012
Scott: that's something else I was talking about.

411
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:58,240
Scott: how you know this created a lot of buzz my Google News RSS feed which has one entry for video games.

412
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:07,388
Scott: when I looked at that RSS feed about an hour after the Wii was announced it had four separate blocks of Wii stories.

413
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:08,291
Scott: four of them.

414
00:32:08,312 --> 00:32:13,273
Scott: that's more blocks of stories than there have ever been for a single topic ever.

415
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:16,787
Rym: Fark had the topic immediately and it filled up.

416
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:19,135
Rym: slashdot had it a bit later and it filled up.

417
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:23,169
Scott: yeah it it exploded all over the internet.

418
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:36,707
Scott: so you might not like the name Wii but if you like what the system is which you should because you know again a rose you should be glad that it exploded.

419
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:40,762
Scott: it's exploding a lot more than Xbox or PS2 did.

420
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:43,472
Scott: they must Reggie's doing his job really really well.

421
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:51,672
Rym: now one thing that I wonder because we obviously take we it's the secret word.

422
00:32:51,692 --> 00:33:07,223
Scott: but I wonder because I saw initially the the topics and the forums where people were talking about it start.

423
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:08,872
Rym: basically the trend was they started with.

424
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:10,156
Rym: that's not true.

425
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:11,481
Rym: that can't be true.

426
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:14,010
Rym: it is true that's stupid.

427
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:15,617
Rym: Nintendo sucks.

428
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:21,904
Rym: no one would buy something that called the same thing as pay and I just wonder what I mean.

429
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:25,681
Rym: obviously over time people are going to take a shot into it or people like us will go.

430
00:33:25,822 --> 00:33:27,994
Rym: I will see what happens or I see why they did that.

431
00:33:28,637 --> 00:33:33,460
Rym: I wonder if Nintendo is going to respond to the significantly negative that response they've gotten to this.

432
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:36,172
Scott: they did in the interview that we just read.

433
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:41,946
Rym: oh yeah but I mean in general it seems at least that maybe it's because people like us don't post so often on forums anymore

434
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:49,321
Scott: things because the people posting on forums are the ps2 Xbox types and all the Nintendo people even the ones who don't like the name are like.

435
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:50,306
Scott: I'm buying it anyway.

436
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:59,468
Scott: you know it's all about what it is and the only reason they date because the brand matters to people who don't know about what it is true it's like.

437
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:00,432
Scott: look at an iPod.

438
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:09,027
Scott: if you actually know about digital music players you probably don't buy an iPod even though I did but you know there are many other players out there.

439
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:15,353
Scott: iPod sells because of its brand and style to people who don't know about digital music players.

440
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,360
Scott: they're trying to do the same thing.

441
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:25,487
Scott: the other the game consoles sell to people because of the company and the games and such.

442
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,658
Rym: yeah though these days I think it's a lot.

443
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:38,188
Scott: it has a lot to do with the exclusive games more than anything yeah but if Nintendo is trying to sell to people who don't know about game consoles they need to sell a brand to those people.

444
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:43,193
Scott: and Revolution is not a brand you can sell to people who don't know about game consoles.

445
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:46,328
Rym: well possibly I could see a lot of ways you could spin the marketing.

446
00:34:46,348 --> 00:34:48,719
Rym: I mean revolution could be revolution.

447
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:52,599
Rym: games are different now games are for everyone or some sort of campaign.

448
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,058
Rym: yeah but the thing is they could do the same kind of campaign with any name they pick.

449
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,507
Rym: yeah the campaign.

450
00:34:57,547 --> 00:34:59,213
Scott: they could have picked a different brand.

451
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:03,646
Scott: besides we like we isn't the most ins they.

452
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:11,529
Scott: the problem I we is that while it's good for so many reasons it's not inspiring at all.

453
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,593
Rym: it didn't resonate it.

454
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:20,123
Scott: it could have picked something that was both inspiring and useful in all the same ways and I guess they just didn't.

455
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,535
Scott: yeah I mean it's too late to turn back.

456
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:27,321
Rym: we'd have a very different conversation if it was a word that just really really kind of clicked with us.

457
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:31,632
Scott: but can you think of a word revolution?

458
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:34,439
Scott: yeah but a word that you can easily sell to everyone.

459
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:46,280
Rym: all right okay well I'm surprised we tapped it so quickly but we really don't have much else to say about the we until e3.

460
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,200
Scott: yeah I guess you know I had all this stuff written down and I lost the stupid text file.

461
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:53,948
Rym: but yeah well we were planning.

462
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:58,837
Rym: I mean originally we figured whenever this news came out we'd wait until the Tuesday and talk about it.

463
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:06,914
Scott: but it exploded so much we had to talk about it today yep and it was gonna take a lot more than just the amount of time for news to talk about.

464
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:09,926
Scott: so we made the whole episode about the Wii?

465
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:17,587
Rym: yeah there's really no other way because if we hadn't we would have had nothing but a flood of emails from all of you saying why didn't you talk about the Wii?

466
00:36:17,828 --> 00:36:18,672
Rym: what's up with the Wii?

467
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:19,977
Rym: you guys hear about the Wii?

468
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:27,826
Scott: yeah trust me we heard about the Wii a minute before or after anyone else actually heard about it.

469
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:33,151
Scott: a minute after some people because instead of a minute before because I was doing some other shit.

470
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:40,988
Rym: the best thing was I heard it right and I went to our forums at the GeekNights forums because I was going to type to everyone hey guess what?

471
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:49,039
Rym: and someone had already posted it and all I could think was yes yes followed by the person is just as fast as we are and tapped into the new.

472
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:49,501
Rym: who was it?

473
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:49,721
Rym: anyway?

474
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:57,711
Rym: I don't know I whoever whoever posted it first in the forums gets a prop not props.

475
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:58,795
Rym: just one prop cuz it was cool.

476
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:04,174
Scott: ooh yeah is that prop like a fake chair with a broken leg?

477
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:07,628
Rym: or it's gonna be a duck like a bowling pin trained duck?

478
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:21,817
Rym: all right yeah but like we said in previous days we have promised a few various people various generally crap o prizes in the forums which will be coming as soon as we have some merch mm-hmm.

479
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,901
Rym: so just don't be impatient because we've got stuff coming and we got stuff in the works.

480
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:26,525
Rym: we got a hopper.

481
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:34,340
Scott: yeah and if you think it's annoying hearing us go all the time during this episode don't worry we decided that because this is the Wii episode.

482
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:39,704
Scott: we're not really gonna make fun of the Wii and go any more after this episode.

483
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,838
Scott: we're just gonna refer to it either as the revolution or the Wii.

484
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,246
Rym: yeah I mean seriously.

485
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:48,885
Rym: there was at least a 15 minute period when every time I said the word we I said it we.

486
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:51,595
Rym: I was like hey what are we going to eat for dinner?

487
00:37:51,615 --> 00:38:03,423
Scott: it was bad it's real bad but by next week we should be all good and we will refer to it as the Nintendo Wii or the Nintendo Revolution normally without joking without squirrels.

488
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:07,177
Rym: I've heard some people call it the we evolution already.

489
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,249
Rym: oh yeah that might catch on.

490
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,999
Scott: wait a minute wait a minute evil.

491
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:18,485
Scott: yeah I like weevils the lesser of two hahahahaha.

492
00:38:24,294 --> 00:38:25,908
Scott: Darwin who was in that movie oh my god.

493
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:26,351
Rym: oh.

494
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:29,770
Scott: the guy who operated on himself pick a who took a bullet out of his own gut.

495
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,036
Rym: the guy who wasn't really Darwin.

496
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:32,524
Scott: the guy who was Darwin.

497
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:38,424
Rym: yeah he's a Jonah that one alright in another in another stupid quiz fashion.

498
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:41,395
Rym: this is not open to anyone who knows us personally.

499
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,226
Rym: what movie were we just talking about?

500
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:45,933
Scott: oh it's so freaking easy.

501
00:38:45,953 --> 00:38:48,162
Rym: you never know you guys.

502
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:51,841
Rym: well I was up here recording some or doing stuff with the podcast or fiddling around.

503
00:38:52,224 --> 00:38:57,048
Rym: I remember you were all sitting downstairs and you came up and you're like there's a trade in this book.

504
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:58,997
Rym: he's a Jonah you know what that's from.

505
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:02,434
Rym: and I said fuck it I'll ruin it never mind forget the contest.

506
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:05,650
Rym: I said master and commander yeah and you guys said what.

507
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,373
Rym: how'd you know that?

508
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:07,478
Scott: I didn't know.

509
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:12,984
Scott: I just like the burning wheel book has a lot of references to things and I didn't know what any of them were mostly.

510
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:17,104
Scott: and but he's a Jonah that one I don't remember that from the movie at all.

511
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:19,815
Scott: and then we had like there's another one.

512
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:21,281
Rym: and yeah white gold wielder.

513
00:39:21,301 --> 00:39:30,825
Scott: yeah yes the thing Evan had read the sci-fi the fantasy book that went with that and he knew exactly what the hell it was and no one else knew.

514
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,052
Scott: cuz no one else had read those books.

515
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:41,733
Rym: yeah at least I can say sometime coming up we're gonna do a burning wheel episode like we said we do since we're actually going to put together a game game of it sometime soon at least within the next month.
