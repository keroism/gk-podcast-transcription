1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,366
Rym: It's Thursday, August 11th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:10,547
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,635
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,589
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,599
Rym: Tonight, Play Dead.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,978
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,933
Scott: Hey Rym, I am not a lawyer.

8
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:28,459
Scott: Did you know that?

9
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:29,227
Rym: Uh, you know what?

10
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:30,220
Rym: I am also not a lawyer.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,900
Rym: Nothing ever said on GeekNights should be construed to be legal advice of any kind.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,340
Scott: Hey Rym, do you want to give me some non-legal advice?

13
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:37,020
Scott: Perhaps.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,658
Scott: I want to read some law to you.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,150
Scott: Uh oh.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,440
Scott: This is from the back of my lease renewal.

17
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:42,216
Rym: Oh no.

18
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:47,900
Rym: I love how my lease renewal has, it says "you cannot sublet" and an asterisk.

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,960
Rym: And then there's a separate thing included by the city that is like, regardless of what your lease says, you can sublet.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,199
Scott: According to these restrictions.

21
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:56,677
Scott: Yup.

22
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:57,311
Scott: And whatever.

23
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:57,619
Scott: Anyway.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:22,560
Scott: If the owner offers a renewal lease less than 90 days prior to the expiration of the existing lease, the lease term selected by the tenant shall begin at the tenant's option either (1) on the date a renewal lease would have begun had a timely offer been made, or (2) on the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days after the date that the owner does offer the lease to the tenant.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,160
Scott: So, this lease was offered, the date on, it says dated July 26, 2011.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,373
Scott: Uh huh.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,178
Scott: My rents are due on the first of the month.

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,280
Scott: Therefore, 90 days from that is like October 10th-ish, something like that.

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:46,360
Scott: Meaning, that if I chose option (2) on the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90, no less than 90 days after the date the owner does offer the lease to the tenant.

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,520
Scott: So, the rent, the lease expires September 30th, 2011.

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:02:00,979
Scott: Which means, the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days after the owner does offer the lease to the tenant would be November 1st, and not October 1st.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,563
Rym: Ah.

33
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:18,160
Scott: The guidelines rate applicable for such a lease shall be no greater than the rate in effect on the commencement date of the lease for which a timely offer should have been made, and the increased rental shall not begin before the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days after such offer is made.

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,520
Rym: So, I feel like you could get away with having one more month of the previous rent.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Scott: That is my reading as well.

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,607
Scott: My rent is going to go up by $57.52 per month if I choose a one-year extension.

37
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,757
Scott: Which means I think I should be paying the old lower rent in the month of October and not have to pay the extra $57 until the month of November.

38
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:41,740
Rym: I would, however, run that by a lawyer.

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,826
Scott: So, I gotta call a lawyer for $57.

40
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:45,614
Scott: It's going to cost me more than $57.

41
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:46,940
Scott: It's not until a lawyer.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:04,480
Rym: The problem here is that there's so much weird legality around rents and leases, partly because tenants get fucked if they're not well-regulated on one side, and landlords get fucked if they're not well-regulated on the other side, and I don't think there is a middle ground that is good for everybody.

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:13,040
Scott: Well, I think I'm going to call the State of New York Division of Housing in something something here, or there's like a rent panel or something.

44
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,600
Scott: Yeah, you may file a complaint with the DHCR if you have something.

45
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,988
Rym: I hope my rent doesn't go up that much.

46
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,335
Rym: It only went up like $20 last time.

47
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:28,880
Scott: But anyway, I'm going to call up, because there's a new management company and I couldn't find their phone number.

48
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,920
Scott: I found out they're actually two management companies with different names, but they're the same company.

49
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,631
Scott: So, I was able to find the other company, call him up.

50
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:36,817
Scott: I found the right guy.

51
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:37,440
Scott: I talked to him.

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,637
Scott: He seemed like a nice enough guy, but when I confronted him with this question, he was like, "Uh...".

53
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:45,329
Rym: Yeah, mine is like all business.

54
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,115
Rym: It's like a call center.

55
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:48,078
Rym: It gets outsourced.

56
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:48,680
Rym: I don't even know.

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,735
Scott: But then I also asked him, he was like, "Is there anything wrong with the

58
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:52,056
Scott: building?".

59
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:52,740
Scott: He was trying to be nice.

60
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,768
Scott: And I was like, "No, the building's

61
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:54,031
Scott: good.".

62
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:55,120
Scott: And you know, he's chatting.

63
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,480
Rym: Except when my apartment got robbed.

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,386
Scott: Well, no, but then I was like, "Wait a minute.

65
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,911
Scott: There is one thing.

66
00:04:01,272 --> 00:04:03,059
Scott: Can I get some fucking Fios up in this

67
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:03,340
Scott: shit?".

68
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,482
Scott: Right?

69
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:08,978
Scott: And he's like, "Call Verizon, and then if they need something from me, call

70
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:09,118
Scott: me.".

71
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:10,868
Scott: I'm gonna call them and do it.

72
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:12,216
Scott: Why not?

73
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:12,760
Scott: It doesn't hurt.

74
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,440
Rym: It's sad that you have to come over here and ration your BitTorrents if they're big enough.

75
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,466
Scott: Uploading is the main thing.

76
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,839
Scott: It doesn't hurt to fucking call, so I'm gonna.

77
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,520
Scott: But I'm also gonna call someone about my... I'm not gonna get a lawyer for $57.

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,247
Scott: If I need to fight to get $57, and it costs money to fight...

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,420
Rym: See, that's why I wouldn't go for it.

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,260
Scott: I mean, going to small claims court is $50 already, right?

81
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:36,979
Rym: That's why I wouldn't go for it.

82
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,957
Scott: But if I can do it for free...

83
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,178
Rym: Even if you're right, and you do it for free, they'll probably fight because economy or scale...

84
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,134
Scott: If they want to fight, let them fight.

85
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:46,800
Scott: That's fine by me.

86
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,039
Rym: But then you'll have to fight back.

87
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,200
Scott: It won't cost me anything to fight back.

88
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,040
Scott: I'm just showing up and filling out papers.

89
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,319
Rym: No, no, so here's what would happen.

90
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,620
Rym: Here's my expectation if they wanted to fight.

91
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,945
Scott: For $57 and 52 cents.

92
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,594
Rym: How do you go about paying the lower rent?

93
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:04,520
Rym: You just pay the lower rent?

94
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:11,860
Scott: Well, first of all, hopefully, I would call someone else, and then they would send me a rent statement for the lower amount.

95
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,578
Rym: They won't do that.

96
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,768
Scott: So I'll send them a check in October.

97
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:16,637
Scott: that is $57 and 52 cents under what they're asking for.

98
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,740
Rym: And you know what I would do if I were the landlord?

99
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,359
Rym: I just wouldn't say anything.

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:29,820
Rym: Your next rent bill would say current rent due X, past due from previous rent Y, and I would just bill you for it.

101
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,519
Scott: I would just keep paying whatever I was owed properly.

102
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,659
Rym: I would keep accruing interest on that and eventually send a collections agency after you.

103
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,719
Scott: I would go...

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,980
Rym: Then you're going to have to fight and pay money.

105
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:42,886
Rym: You're going to do that?

106
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,400
Rym: You're going to pay the $57.

107
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,431
Rym: Now, plus interest.

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,678
Rym: Also, they would have ammo if they wanted to kick you out.

109
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Scott: The thing is, I would take care of it before it got to the collections agency.

110
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:57,780
Rym: But they probably wouldn't say anything.

111
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,911
Rym: Or maybe they'd call you one day and be like, "You owe us

112
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:01,701
Rym: $4,000.".

113
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,796
Scott: I'd be like, "Fuck, no I

114
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:03,019
Scott: don't.".

115
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:05,279
Rym: I don't know.

116
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,120
Scott: I'm just going to see if I can call someone and get it sorted out for free.

117
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:10,079
Scott: Here's the trouble.

118
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:15,040
Rym: They don't know if they're obligated to do this or not.

119
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:16,538
Rym: And you don't know.

120
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:19,259
Scott: I'm going to call someone and find out.

121
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:21,280
Scott: Who are you going to call?

122
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,500
Rym: The city's not going to tell you.

123
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,120
Rym: I'd call 311.

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,960
Rym: Those city hotlines, Scott, are not allowed to give you legal advice.

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,160
Scott: No, but I can call the Division of Housing and whatever.

126
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,900
Rym: Yeah, and I've called places like that before.

127
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,438
Scott: For administration.

128
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:37,660
Rym: Emily, her old landlord, which was also our old landlord, never gave her a security deposit back.

129
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:42,840
Rym: She actually had no... At least we put a hole in the ceiling and we left some messes behind.

130
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,739
Rym: So I don't feel that bad.

131
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,811
Scott: Even though he said, "That's

132
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:45,176
Scott: fine."

133
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,200
Scott: We just never asked for it.

134
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:49,834
Rym: I didn't want to fight too hard.

135
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:50,380
Rym: Just a pain in the ass.

136
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,860
Rym: But Emily's fighting and it's really hard to learn what the law really is without a lawyer.

137
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:02,639
Rym: Because any city agency you call will be like, "Uh, we can't give you advice, so..." Click.

138
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,506
Scott: That's bullshit.

139
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:08,260
Scott: The city should... It's like, I'm asking the government for what the law is.

140
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,440
Scott: They should have to fucking tell me.

141
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:13,760
Rym: Scott, I got an assessment of the property lines of that house I was going to buy in Beacon.

142
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,013
Rym: You realize any question I asked anyone was responded to with, "We cannot give you advice on

143
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:21,254
Rym: this.".

144
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,669
Rym: And I was like, "So, what?

145
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:27,078
Rym: Is this a form I should fill out to get an

146
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:27,519
Rym: assessment?".

147
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:28,872
Rym: "It says assessment form.

148
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:29,297
Rym: Is this the

149
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:29,499
Rym: form?".

150
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,529
Rym: They're like, "We can't give you

151
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:30,913
Rym: advice.".

152
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:36,339
Rym: I'm like, "So I'm going to fill this form out and I'm going to give you a

153
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:36,580
Rym: check.".

154
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,608
Rym: "Because it says you need like

155
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,281
Rym: $100.".

156
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:42,557
Rym: "Will an assessment form come out of you after I do

157
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:42,798
Rym: this?".

158
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:44,699
Rym: And they wouldn't tell me.

159
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:46,820
Scott: Well, they should have to tell you.

160
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:47,500
Scott: I know they should.

161
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:55,705
Scott: There's a difference between giving legal advice, obviously this isn't what it is, but legal advice should be like, "Okay, look.

162
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:56,809
Scott: I have a business.

163
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,634
Scott: Some guy did something.

164
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,139
Scott: Should I sue him or

165
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,400
Scott: not?".

166
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,090
Scott: "Is it a good

167
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:01,618
Scott: idea?".

168
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,694
Scott: "Could I sue him for this?

169
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,379
Scott: Could I sue him for

170
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:04,560
Scott: that?".

171
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:06,627
Scott: "I was accused of a crime.

172
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:08,052
Scott: Should I plead guilty?

173
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:08,615
Scott: Should I

174
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:08,936
Scott: settle?".

175
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:11,151
Scott: "What should I do?

176
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:11,657
Scott: I don't know what to

177
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:11,758
Scott: do.".

178
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,277
Rym: Legal advice should be, "What is the

179
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:14,660
Rym: law?".

180
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,501
Rym: Every time you get a new job, what do you do?

181
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,466
Rym: You fill out your W-9s, W-4s, or I-9, W-4s.

182
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:21,427
Rym: Anyway, so the W-4.

183
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:28,880
Rym: Every HR person I've ever talked to, which interestingly has always been a lady in my entire life, has said, "No, wait.

184
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,384
Scott: No, not

185
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:29,687
Scott: true.".

186
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:32,407
Rym: "I've never had a non-female HR

187
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:32,749
Rym: person.".

188
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:32,972
Scott: "I

189
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:33,135
Scott: did.".

190
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:35,583
Rym: But they will always say,

191
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,107
Rym: "Alright.".

192
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,248
Rym: Especially to young people, "This is the form where you pick how many exemptions you

193
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:40,470
Rym: have.".

194
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:42,267
Rym: "I can't give you any

195
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:42,490
Rym: advice.".

196
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:44,743
Rym: And it even says on the form, "They can't give you any

197
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:45,049
Rym: advice.".

198
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:48,903
Rym: And then they always pause and say, "You pretty much want to write either 0 or

199
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,031
Rym: 1.".

200
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,124
Rym: "Unless you know why you need to write a different

201
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:52,406
Rym: number.".

202
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,689
Rym: I feel like that should be okay to say.

203
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:01,210
Rym: I don't think it is actually okay to say, though.

204
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,563
Scott: But it's like you're reading the form, and you see what the form... I looked at this paper.

205
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,270
Scott: I have a lease here.

206
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,219
Scott: I read what it says.

207
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:13,372
Scott: In plain English, that tells me I do not owe them that $57.52.

208
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:17,164
Scott: But then I ask someone, "I just read this, and that's what I think it

209
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:17,567
Scott: says.".

210
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,035
Scott: It almost 100% clearly says that.

211
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,369
Scott: Does it indeed say that?

212
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,501
Scott: "You need to get a

213
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:24,828
Scott: lawyer.".

214
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,759
Scott: It's like, "What the fuck?

215
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,224
Scott: Just tell

216
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:26,346
Scott: me!".

217
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,019
Scott: "You wrote the form!

218
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:28,905
Scott: You can tell me what that

219
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:29,308
Scott: means!".

220
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:38,710
Rym: I will, however, look into this because my lease renewal came like three weeks before we had to renew last time.

221
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,070
Rym: And I'm kind of thinking about moving.

222
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:45,510
Scott: What's wrong with this building?

223
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,680
Rym: This building's okay, but I got a lot of money.

224
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:51,789
Rym: When we moved in here, I made way less money than I do now.

225
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,950
Scott: So you had to move into an even fancier building?

226
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,490
Scott: Is that just it?

227
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,421
Scott: I would move into a similarly fancy building.

228
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,970
Rym: I basically want the same apartment just in a nicer neighborhood.

229
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,211
Rym: Like, literally, I want to go two to three stops closer to Manhattan on the 7.

230
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,609
Rym: Or a little more north toward Astoria near you.

231
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,170
Scott: You can cut this fancy building across the street from me.

232
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,229
Rym: There are, but Vernon Jackson is really nice.

233
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:19,109
Scott: Anyway, I'm gonna call up this other place here.

234
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,830
Rym: So, we talk a lot about trolls and hacking and all that stuff, and usually when someone trolls someone, it's on the internet.

235
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,988
Rym: Usually when they hack something, it's on the internet.

236
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,290
Rym: But occasionally you have the person who hacks a physical thing, hacks a person, trolls a person in real life.

237
00:10:36,414 --> 00:10:38,537
Rym: All three of these things came together in Germany.

238
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:44,722
Rym: I can't believe I never thought of this, though there is a precedent in The Simpsons for this very thing happening.

239
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:48,536
Scott: So, some people made a t-shirt.

240
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:58,290
Rym: The t-shirt quotes the so-called design of a skull and right-wing flags with the words "Hardcore

241
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,154
Rym: Rebels."

242
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,649
Rym: This was aimed at neo-Nazi skinhead dickwads.

243
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,669
Scott: So they gave them all free t-shirts that they would like.

244
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,256
Rym: Yep, you go to a skinhead concert and you're like, "Check out this skinhead t-shirt.

245
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:10,902
Scott: Totally

246
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:11,185
Scott: free.".

247
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:21,550
Rym: Turns out, when they get wet, or you wash them, all that design disappears and now it's an anti-racism t-shirt.

248
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,172
Scott: Nice.

249
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,030
Rym: I think that's pretty great.

250
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:32,089
Scott: Let's give out free t-shirts to fanboys and anime cons that have perverted moe girls on it, and then when you wash, they'll never wash them.

251
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:37,669
Scott: So, basically in the heat, as opposed to in the water, because they're never going to touch water.

252
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,590
Rym: Now, what do you want it to turn into?

253
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,517
Rym: Because I think...

254
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,901
Scott: I'm a perverted fanboy.

255
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:43,849
Scott: Don't come near me.

256
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:44,867
Rym: No, no, no, no, no.

257
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:48,107
Rym: I would simply have it turn into the Forever Alone face.

258
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:50,738
Scott: That's just insulting.

259
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:51,829
Rym: They mean the same thing.

260
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,960
Rym: I'm just... I don't know.

261
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:56,577
Rym: I love stuff like this.

262
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:57,810
Rym: I mean, one, I love pranks.

263
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,921
Scott: Or it could start out as like a cute little girl and then when it gets hot, it turns into porn or you go to jail.

264
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:04,927
Rym: Scott, you know what would scare those guys the most?

265
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:05,089
Rym: Trust?

266
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:09,249
Rym: If it's a cute little girl, it turns into a sexy adult girl.

267
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:09,695
Scott: No.

268
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:13,250
Scott: I love pranks.

269
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,906
Rym: I love hacking things.

270
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:15,999
Rym: I love hacking people.

271
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,090
Rym: I love messing with people.

272
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,837
Rym: I love trolling.

273
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:23,046
Rym: So, this is pretty much a perfect storm and I really want to come up...

274
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:23,470
Scott: Is this a news?

275
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,784
Scott: It sounds like a thing of the day to me.

276
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:28,609
Rym: It's a news because I feel like we need to use this to greater effect.

277
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:31,530
Rym: Who could we target that would have the most impact?

278
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:33,030
Scott: Who do we like the least?

279
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:40,018
Scott: But the thing is it's like, okay, we could give them to corrupt politicians, but they don't want free t-shirts.

280
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:40,970
Rym: They don't wear t-shirts.

281
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,513
Scott: Right.

282
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:46,323
Scott: It has to be someone we don't like that also likes free t-shirts and will wear them.

283
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:46,890
Rym: Tea party.

284
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:49,979
Scott: Are they going to wear the free t-shirt and give them immediately?

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,449
Rym: The only trouble with the tea parties is you're going to have to get from.

286
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:55,090
Rym: your sizes are pretty much from XL up.

287
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,629
Scott: Let's just get into religious people.

288
00:12:59,027 --> 00:12:59,090
Rym: Oh.

289
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,009
Rym: That's the way to do it.

290
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:05,070
Rym: When I talk about pranks, my favorite kind of prank is the subtle prank.

291
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:08,182
Scott: Or we can give them to randy type people.

292
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:12,949
Scott: It's like a pro-fake medicine shirt and then it's like science is king.

293
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,149
Scott: Sciencebasedmedicine.org.

294
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,828
Rym: You just give them homeopathic shirts.

295
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,029
Scott: Here's one Rym.

296
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:23,860
Scott: You're wearing it.

297
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,990
Rym: I am indeed.

298
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,949
Rym: Scott Johnston has a non-homeopathic sweater.

299
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,790
Rym: Let's say you want to get religious people.

300
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:42,930
Rym: You have a really religiously nice Jesus doing something shirt and you make it change very subtly when it's washed.

301
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,690
Scott: To make them believe that something magical happened?

302
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,889
Scott: Stigmata appear.

303
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:48,345
Scott: Oh yeah.

304
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:55,970
Scott: If you could develop an even better science to where multiple washings causes more changes.

305
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:57,089
Rym: It's like a gobstopper.

306
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:00,718
Scott: It's perfectly synced up chemically.

307
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:00,961
Scott: One wash.

308
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,230
Scott: Second wash, something else happens.

309
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,909
Scott: Third wash, something else happens.

310
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:13,068
Rym: If we had better technology, you'd pull a Batman where the shirt is fine until a particular gas is in the room and then oh shit.

311
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:16,789
Rym: Then you get everyone at once changes.

312
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:25,230
Scott: You give out the shirts in winter but then the shirts have to get hot before they change.

313
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,678
Rym: I feel like I want to figure out exactly how they did it.

314
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:29,569
Rym: See if it works.

315
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:35,009
Scott: I think they just did a one time thing where they basically had a dissolving pigment on the shirt.

316
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,533
Scott: You could just silkscreen it with something that dissolves in water and then when you wash it, it goes away.

317
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:44,986
Rym: I want to figure out how to do this if it can be made better and then I want to come up with a really good way to use this.

318
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,029
Rym: Because I really don't like Illinois Nazis.

319
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:48,792
Scott: No.

320
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:49,689
Rym: Really.

321
00:14:51,642 --> 00:15:01,069
Scott: So London Riots, I don't want to talk about the London Riots themselves but I do want to talk about this article on the MSNBC World Blog.

322
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,540
Rym: I am going to make a prediction.

323
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:06,150
Rym: This article is grossly uninformed and you're mad about that.

324
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,797
Scott: No, not at all.

325
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,830
Scott: Actually, this is like the only article that I think is approaching this story the right way.

326
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:16,355
Scott: It's very short and it's pretty much like the title is "The Sad Truth Behind London

327
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:16,679
Scott: Riot."

328
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,349
Scott: And I'm only going to read a couple paragraphs here.

329
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:32,038
Scott: "As political and social protests throughout the Middle East are growing in Europe and a riot exploded in North London this weekend, here's the sad truth expressed by a Londoner when asked by a television reporter, 'Is rioting the correct way to express your

330
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:32,665
Scott: discontent?'.

331
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,989
Scott: 'Yes,' said the young man.

332
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,817
Scott: 'You wouldn't be talking to me now if we didn't riot, would

333
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:38,021
Scott: you?'.

334
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:43,770
Scott: The TV reporter from Britain's ITV had no response so the young man pressed his advantage.

335
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,570
Scott: 'Two months ago we marched a Scotland Yard, more than 2,000 of us, all blacks, and it was peaceful and calm.

336
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,256
Scott: And you know what?

337
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:51,669
Scott: Not a word in the press.

338
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:55,022
Scott: Last night, a bit of rioting and looting, and look around

339
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:55,204
Scott: you.'".

340
00:15:55,971 --> 00:16:13,729
Scott: Alright, so basically I think this angle, that this is the only article I've seen taken this very intelligent angle, is the press basically is blaming itself for rioting by not covering the things that people actually care about.

341
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:14,578
Scott: Right?

342
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,790
Scott: The press is actually causing the people to be angry.

343
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,370
Scott: I mean, they already don't have bread in circuses, but even when they didn't have bread in circuses they still didn't riot.

344
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,222
Scott: It's because their peaceful means didn't work.

345
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:37,489
Scott: If the media is only going to pay attention to sensationalist things, that is encouraging attention-seeking people in society to do sensationalist things.

346
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:45,330
Scott: If the media would pay attention and give screen time to things that were less sensational- Ah, ah, ah, ah, but here's the rub.

347
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:50,090
Rym: Their ratings may go down, but- Not only would their ratings go down, Scott, but I don't think anyone would watch anymore.

348
00:16:50,550 --> 00:17:04,150
Scott: Possibly, you are correct, but at the same time if they paid attention to non-sensationalist, non-violent, non-crazy things, it would actually cause society to become less sensational.

349
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,756
Scott: Like, if you didn't pay attention- It's like the same thing with the policy we have with a guy running on the field at a baseball game.

350
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:11,848
Scott: You don't get on TV.

351
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,221
Scott: All the TV cameras cut away when you run on the baseball field.

352
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:17,401
Scott: I know the soccer field, they do something different.

353
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:19,583
Scott: They let the naked guy on TV, maybe, I don't know.

354
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:20,190
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

355
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,059
Rym: You gotta make something happen or no one's gonna watch soccer.

356
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:35,867
Scott: But in the United States, if you run on the field of a professional, nationally, or even just state locally televised professional, or even like college sporting event- You're lucky if a single frame of you even approaching appears on live TV.

357
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,310
Scott: You will not be on television, period.

358
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:42,110
Scott: The cameras will cut away, nobody will see you except the people at the stadium.

359
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,764
Rym: Now granted, they're going apeshit.

360
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:48,613
Scott: But the people at the stadium will also be pissed that you're basically just delaying the game and being a jerk.

361
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:49,643
Rym: I've never seen that.

362
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:53,765
Scott: Every time I've seen this happen at a game- I've only seen people cheer if the guy gets away.

363
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,199
Scott: One time, a guy ran across the field, jumped up into the outfield, and got out.

364
00:17:57,502 --> 00:17:58,108
Scott: Oh, man.

365
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,724
Scott: That they cheer for, right?

366
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:04,552
Scott: But if you just run on the field and get tackled like a doofus, people aren't that pleased with you.

367
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:09,563
Scott: I think we need that same policy, basically for any morons.

368
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:13,849
Scott: You can say dude ran on the field, but you can't show the dude who ran on the field, right?

369
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:19,967
Scott: And it's like, it's kind of tough though with rioting, because it's like we need to see the rioting, right?

370
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,189
Scott: But, by showing the rioting, you're causing riots.

371
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,069
Rym: But, like you just said, if we don't show the rioting, they'll riot again.

372
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:29,336
Scott: Well, no.

373
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:33,727
Scott: If we would have showed the non-rioting in the first place, they wouldn't have rioted.

374
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,690
Rym: But, non-rioting, not difficult.

375
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,429
Rym: How many non-riots are there in a given day?

376
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,350
Scott: Yeah, but I mean 2,000 people doing a peaceful protest I think is worthy of news.

377
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:47,525
Rym: It's got 2,000 people in a major city is nothing.

378
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:51,590
Rym: More people are like taking the elevator up to my part of my building.

379
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:58,495
Scott: Right, but I'm saying is that a 2,000, while not that big, you know, in the old grand scheme, is a pretty significant protest.

380
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:05,849
Scott: Most days, I mean, I saw an NBC union protest this morning at Bike Pass outside 30 Rock and it was like 10 union guys.

381
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,649
Scott: That doesn't need to be on the fucking news.

382
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,900
Rym: Here's the other question.

383
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,840
Scott: 2,000 people I think could get a news clip.

384
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:11,789
Rym: Riddle me this.

385
00:19:12,371 --> 00:19:14,766
Rym: What were those 2,000 people marching for?

386
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:17,850
Scott: Uh, it doesn't say in the article.

387
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:19,260
Rym: Huh, huh.

388
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:21,424
Rym: What were the rioters rioting for?

389
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:23,109
Scott: They're pissed off because they're poor.

390
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:26,050
Rym: Alright, so we know they're pissed off because they're poor.

391
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:26,999
Rym: There's no jobs.

392
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:27,910
Rym: There's no jobs.

393
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,329
Scott: And the police are abusing them.

394
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:38,670
Rym: So, what sort of non-violent protest in a modern democracy could possibly make more jobs appear?

395
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,390
Scott: All the people, see the thing is, people don't really, you know, they're like children.

396
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,090
Scott: Everyone's like children, right?

397
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:45,462
Scott: Right?

398
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:55,611
Scott: People really, all people, even if you don't actually solve their problem, if you just make them believe, like really believe you're helping them and working on it, right?

399
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,855
Scott: It's like when you go to the bullshit randy doctor, right?

400
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:01,690
Scott: They might be giving you some fake medicine, homeopathy, that doesn't actually cure your disease.

401
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:06,784
Scott: But you like them better than the real doctor, because the real doctor is like here's some medicine, get the fuck out.

402
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:07,693
Scott: You know, I'm reading this book.

403
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:14,137
Scott: Even though the medicine works, but if you go to the fake doctor, the fake doctor won't help you cure your disease, you're gonna still go home and die.

404
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,792
Rym: I'm reading a book right now set in kind of a pseudo-bizantium, right?

405
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:19,190
Rym: And the emperor just died.

406
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,390
Scott: But they make you believe they're helping you and they care.

407
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:28,077
Rym: So the senate is, you know, the fake senate that doesn't do anything, is convening to nominally decide who the next emperor will be.

408
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:29,895
Scott: But they already know who the emperor is gonna be.

409
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:30,703
Rym: Well, they don't yet.

410
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:32,137
Rym: They're sure someone will tell them.

411
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:38,323
Rym: But a mob forms and bursts into the senate chamber, like just riotous mob ready to go.

412
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:38,709
Rym: Alright.

413
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:48,609
Rym: So the mob stops for a second because the chamber is so grandiose, and a senator stands up and says, "Yes, people of the city, we are going to choose your next emperor.

414
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,849
Rym: We need your help.

415
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,101
Rym: Tell us the people you think are worthy of being the next

416
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:55,525
Rym: emperor.".

417
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,737
Rym: And the whole mob kind of diffuses into people shouting names.

418
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:00,515
Rym: They write them all down dutifully.

419
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,586
Rym: Everyone's happy.

420
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:02,132
Rym: They all go home.

421
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:02,960
Rym: They throw all the names away.

422
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:03,970
Scott: That's exactly right.

423
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:09,709
Rym: I don't think Egypt would even have happened had they just let the protest happen and fizzle out.

424
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,830
Scott: Well, I mean, it's just act like you're paying, you know, act like you care.

425
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,910
Scott: Like, you know, be like, "Oh, you're protesting.

426
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:16,593
Scott: Alright.".

427
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:21,527
Scott: You know, and the thing is they put on like, you know, the obviously fake propaganda bullshit.

428
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,081
Scott: It's like, "No, actually, just take the people in.

429
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:24,151
Scott: Talk to them

430
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:24,737
Scott: seriously.".

431
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:28,274
Scott: You know, don't be like just, "Oh, we're just talking to you for show.

432
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,244
Scott: I'm just going to let you sit

433
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:29,506
Scott: there.".

434
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:30,577
Scott: But you don't actually do anything.

435
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:31,809
Scott: Just actually talk to the person.

436
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:36,170
Scott: Actually make it seem like you're actually caring and considering them.

437
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:44,520
Rym: So Scott, you're asking politicians and city officials to act like politicians and city officials as they were intended to be.

438
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:44,969
Scott: Yes.

439
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:48,050
Rym: I don't think that's possible.

440
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:48,836
Scott: Why can't they?

441
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:49,444
Scott: I'm not asking.

442
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:54,291
Scott: I'm not even asking for what I really should be asking for, which is actually do that, right?

443
00:21:54,332 --> 00:21:55,725
Scott: But to just act like it.

444
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,040
Scott: They can't even act?

445
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:57,809
Scott: Really?

446
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,710
Scott: It's like, you know, an acting job could quell the riot.

447
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,062
Scott: You know, actually not acting and doing it sincerely would be even better.

448
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:06,737
Scott: I would much rather have that.

449
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:09,370
Scott: But you're telling me you can't even act and pretend?

450
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,323
Scott: Have faux sincerity?

451
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:12,252
Rym: So you want to know why?

452
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:16,839
Rym: The spark of the protest was a young man who was shot by the police.

453
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,990
Rym: One of those whole things.

454
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:34,534
Rym: But the media, the Fox News equivalents over there and a lot of the rightish leaning media are talking about it this way are selling the whole riot thing as being caused by urban youths rioting about some gang banger who got shot.

455
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:41,019
Scott: Well, that's why the police, right, were always, you know, so you know, being so brutal and inappropriate.

456
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,899
Scott: I mean, the UK has a long history of that anyway, especially against youths, right?

457
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:52,049
Scott: The police versus youths is like the biggest, you know, like, I think social conflict they have over there, at least judging by the media that gets over to us.

458
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:58,638
Scott: You know, it's pretty much police versus youths and poor people in the UK is the wrong.

459
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,110
Scott: I'm like hot fuzz.

460
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:02,672
Scott: It's like that whole town is like the hoodies, right?

461
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:09,169
Scott: It's, you know, it's symbolizing that, you know, UK wide, you know, authority versus youth battle.

462
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:19,543
Rym: Except really, it's just like the whole thing is just feeding into whatever narrative is politically expedient and sensationalism just happens to be a big part of that sensationalism.

463
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:23,563
Rym: and then fear of whatever is being sensationalized followed by a paternal.

464
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:28,594
Rym: We will stop that from happening when in fact they're the ones who actually indirectly caused it.

465
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:29,527
Scott: You made it happen, yes.

466
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:30,812
Scott: Ah.

467
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:41,174
Rym: So things of the day.

468
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:44,385
Rym: When I was a kid, an African Grey, my mom still has this African Grey.

469
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,020
Scott: That's a parrot for those of you who don't know.

470
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,646
Rym: They are.

471
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,013
Scott: I only know because talked about this a whole bunch.

472
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:52,649
Rym: I wouldn't have known are probably the smartest of the birds.

473
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:54,367
Rym: And they're generally there.

474
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:54,690
Rym: I don't know.

475
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:57,960
Scott: I thought like most parents, you imagine like the green parrot, right?

476
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,605
Scott: It wouldn't.

477
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,780
Rym: That's that's on Amazon.

478
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,973
Rym: They're actually kind of derpy compared to other parents.

479
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:04,387
Scott: But the African Grey is grey.

480
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:07,540
Scott: The grey parrot is smarter than the stereotypical green one.

481
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,113
Rym: The grey parrot is the smartest.

482
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:09,335
Rym: They.

483
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:22,059
Rym: I've read real people who know about these things saying that above average intelligence, African Grey can achieve the same level of self awareness and communication as a two to three year old human child.

484
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:22,968
Scott: Oh, two to three.

485
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:24,647
Scott: OK, so we can't learn the alphabet.

486
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,566
Rym: They kind of can't read.

487
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:27,557
Rym: They can't read.

488
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:30,970
Scott: No, but like a kindergartner who's five can learn the alphabet.

489
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:34,280
Rym: Yeah, but like they can learn words and use them contextually.

490
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,203
Scott: But if you made it like watch Sesame Street, would that help?

491
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,154
Rym: Maybe.

492
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:37,640
Scott: Maybe.

493
00:24:38,002 --> 00:24:39,817
Scott: Like you can't give it books.

494
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,606
Rym: She learned all the different kinds of food she liked and had names for all of them.

495
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:49,759
Rym: Some of them were the names we gave them, but things we had not named for her, she made up her own names.

496
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,840
Scott: So how did you know, though, that's what she was talking about?

497
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:53,114
Rym: It was pretty apparent.

498
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:57,299
Rym: For example, one day she started asking, she started saying cookie nut.

499
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,846
Rym: Cookie nut.

500
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,971
Rym: Because we'd given her cookies and nuts before, and she started saying cookie nut, cookie nut, cookie nut.

501
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:08,760
Rym: We eventually figured out that what she wanted was one particular nut, the almond.

502
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,100
Rym: So when she'd ask for it, and if we gave her something else, she'd throw it to the ground and go, uh oh.

503
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,179
Scott: I threw it on the ground.

504
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,539
Scott: You can't trust the system.

505
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,917
Rym: Anyway, parrots are really smart, and this is a parrot who really does not want to be pooped on.

506
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:42,506
Rym: This is obviously one of those cases where the people who own this parrot are constantly yelling at it for pooping on things, so it is decided to say those things back because that is obviously what people say most of the time.

507
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:44,625
Rym: Like, he thinks, "Don't poop on

508
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:44,828
Rym: that.".

509
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:45,212
Rym: It's like,

510
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:45,858
Rym: "Hello!".

511
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:47,552
Scott: Okay.

512
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:55,334
Scott: I don't want to get a parrot because they're expensive or take care of it because it's a pain in the ass, and it might fly around the apartment and cause mayhem.

513
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:57,620
Rym: But a talking animal, you want to teach it to say funny shit?

514
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:03,540
Scott: I just want to see what happens if you have a parrot from when it's a little... Can you get one that's in an egg and it hatches?

515
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,479
Rym: You want to start a little past that.

516
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,239
Scott: Well, who takes care of it first?

517
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:09,139
Rym: Uh, the mom.

518
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,159
Scott: Oh, yeah.

519
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,722
Scott: Anyway.

520
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:12,288
Rym: I mean, it depends.

521
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,532
Rym: I don't want to get into the breeding of parrots.

522
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:16,558
Scott: The point is I wanted to watch Sesame Street and see what it says.

523
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:20,753
Scott: If it grows up on Sesame Street, specifically.

524
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:21,763
Rym: Scott, Google around for it.

525
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:22,753
Rym: Forget the parrot's name now.

526
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:23,500
Scott: Sesame Street parrot?

527
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:32,491
Rym: There's one particular African gray parrot who was exceptionally intelligent, and there are tons of videos of this parrot being surprisingly coherent and chill.

528
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:34,389
Scott: No, but see, I don't want to see the smartest parrot.

529
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,357
Scott: I want to see specifically the Sesame Street parrot.

530
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:37,981
Scott: Right?

531
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:40,285
Scott: That is pretty much lived with the Cookie Monster.

532
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:42,853
Rym: Well, we know Sesame Street is not suitable for children, so...

533
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:43,399
Scott: I know.

534
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:44,407
Scott: Yeah, and that's the thing.

535
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:45,094
Scott: Maybe get two.

536
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,580
Scott: One new Sesame Street, one old Sesame Street.

537
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:48,970
Rym: One, uh... And Mr.

538
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,719
Scott: Rogers is the control group.

539
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:53,780
Scott: See what happens.

540
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,533
Rym: Alright.

541
00:26:55,602 --> 00:26:56,477
Scott: Oh, thing of the day, right?

542
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:56,660
Scott: Yeah.

543
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:00,549
Scott: So you remember, uh, was it PAX East?

544
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,893
Scott: I think it was the last PAX West a year ago.

545
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:03,763
Scott: I'm not 100% sure.

546
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:06,365
Scott: I'm pretty sure it was PAX West.

547
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:13,560
Scott: Um... Gabe and, you know, Mike and Jerry and also Scott Kurz announced a new comic.

548
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:17,965
Scott: As in, they're gonna keep doing Penny Arcade and something else.

549
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:18,737
Scott: Oh, yeah.

550
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:23,520
Scott: And that was called The Trenches, and basically, it's about game testing.

551
00:27:23,783 --> 00:27:30,205
Scott: And the difference between this and Penny Arcade is that, number one, there's a third person working on it, so it's two artists and, you know, three writers.

552
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:35,960
Scott: Um... And also, it's gonna be sequential, as in, there's a story.

553
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,000
Scott: It's not topical, where, you know, so you get to read it from the beginning, like other webcomics.

554
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,030
Scott: It's a serial story.

555
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:42,285
Scott: It's called The Trenches.

556
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:43,520
Scott: It's about game testing.

557
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:45,920
Scott: And they stop shit talking.

558
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:50,751
Scott: It's every Tuesday and Thursday, and it's Thursday today, so the second comic strip is up today.

559
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:51,379
Rym: Oh, shit.

560
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:52,346
Scott: It's pretty good.

561
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:53,960
Scott: I added it to my webcomics queue.

562
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,946
Rym: Oh, man.

563
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:56,179
Scott: Uh, how could you not?

564
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:58,566
Rym: It's rare that I add a new webcomic to the queue.

565
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:02,648
Scott: But now, think about, you know, Mike and Jerry are making five comics a week, though.

566
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:04,102
Scott: I guess that's good.

567
00:28:04,122 --> 00:28:06,022
Scott: They're earning their... Right?

568
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:07,340
Scott: 'Cause they're basically working three days.

569
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:15,257
Rym: Granted, a sequential comic that has a story, like, you can chart it out, I feel like it's easier to keep the momentum going than every other day.

570
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:19,680
Rym: Alright, we need one joke that will carry an entire day's comic.

571
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,529
Scott: Yeah, exactly, right?

572
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,400
Scott: So, you think about it.

573
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,280
Scott: It's like, you know, the South Park syndrome.

574
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,469
Scott: What are we gonna do this episode?

575
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:28,953
Scott: Ahh... But if you do a two-parter, well, now you knock two out of the park.

576
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:35,319
Scott: Well, if you do an infinite-parter that just keeps going, you just look at the previous comic and you know what the next one's gonna be.

577
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:37,860
Rym: What has the bonds not yet jumped over?

578
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,953
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you just, you know, as long as you've mapped out a significant portion of it, you don't have to map it out to the end.

579
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,305
Scott: You know, you can just keep going and keep going and keep going.

580
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:54,991
Scott: You know, not saying it's easy, but what you get is you don't have that problem that we have with GeekNights, which is, what do we do the show on today?

581
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:55,435
Scott: Right?

582
00:28:55,455 --> 00:29:00,159
Scott: Your problems are all the specifics of, you know, what exact, what's the exact wording gonna be.

583
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:06,929
Scott: and then, you know, that stuff, as opposed to, you know, the general, you need a general idea, you know, a blank slate every fucking day.

584
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:07,840
Scott: It's a huge pain in the ass.

585
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:16,545
Rym: Of course, at the same time, with Penny Arcade, they just have to go to, you know, whatever gaming blog they happen to look at and see, you know, what just got talked about.

586
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:21,655
Scott: Listen to those fourth panels, the old podcast and the PATV where they make comics.

587
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:23,575
Scott: They have the same problems that we have in South Park.

588
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,827
Rym: Everyone has those problems.

589
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:27,251
Scott: They got crab peoples, they got everything.

590
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:28,786
Rym: Yep, and you know what everyone needs?

591
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:30,036
Rym: Writers retreats.

592
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,539
Scott: South Park didn't have one, this.

593
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:34,808
Scott: I know.

594
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:39,151
Rym: So, briefly, in the meta moment, the Book Club book is The Ear, The Eye, The Arm.

595
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:40,140
Rym: It is my book.

596
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,189
Rym: The previous Book Club book, Isaac Asimov's Foundation.

597
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,280
Scott: Where's that episode, Raymond?

598
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,032
Rym: It'll be up tonight.

599
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:46,930
Rym: Yesterday, you were here.

600
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:47,740
Rym: What was I doing?

601
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,351
Rym: Playing games with you.

602
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,238
Scott: I told you to put it up.

603
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:50,944
Rym: Yeah.

604
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:51,430
Rym: And you didn't.

605
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:53,009
Rym: And everyone left late.

606
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,778
Scott: You said you did.

607
00:29:54,381 --> 00:29:55,129
Rym: You said you would.

608
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:56,989
Rym: I said I would put it up at some point.

609
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:57,718
Rym: And you didn't.

610
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,038
Rym: I didn't say when I'd put it up.

611
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:00,180
Scott: Uh-huh.

612
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,148
Scott: Well, you didn't yet.

613
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:02,846
Rym: I know, but I did not say when.

614
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:04,060
Rym: I'll probably put it up tonight.

615
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:04,663
Rym: Uh-huh.

616
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,967
Rym: There's no reason why I shouldn't put it up tonight.

617
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:07,492
Scott: Nah.

618
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:09,579
Rym: We'll have to record the other one.

619
00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:11,979
Rym: So, I ordered The Ear, The Eye, The Arm a while ago.

620
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:13,997
Rym: Still hasn't shipped from Amazon.

621
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:14,502
Rym: I don't know what's up.

622
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,167
Scott: I ordered it from Amazon.

623
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:15,490
Scott: It shipped.

624
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:16,297
Rym: Mine didn't.

625
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:17,389
Rym: Good job.

626
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,858
Rym: The fuck?

627
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,543
Scott: It probably might be there when I get home today.

628
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:23,574
Rym: We will be at the Penny Arcade Expo on Saturday at noon.

629
00:30:23,634 --> 00:30:28,765
Rym: We will be doing Discover the Forgotten Masters on Saturday from 6pm to, I believe, 8pm.

630
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:36,058
Rym: We will be in the tabletop workshop area teaching people how to play Seven Wonders, Carcassonne, Spotted, and Inspectors.

631
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,067
Scott: When's our panel?

632
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,250
Rym: Noon on Saturday, like I just said.

633
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:42,140
Scott: So everything is Saturday.

634
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,542
Scott: Yes.

635
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:46,886
Scott: Alright, so I declare Friday to be Day of Gaming.

636
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:51,046
Scott: After that keynote and Q&A, non-stop gaming.

637
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,110
Rym: On Friday, I'm going to pause the gaming to eat dinner at Von's.

638
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,860
Scott: Well, obviously.

639
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,654
Rym: And I'm also going to, I might go to the concert.

640
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:03,233
Rym: Because one main event is in the fucking Paramount.

641
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:03,680
Rym: Eh.

642
00:31:04,684 --> 00:31:05,896
Scott: I've had enough of Pac's concerts.

643
00:31:05,956 --> 00:31:06,279
Rym: No, no, no.

644
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:09,129
Rym: I've seen many of the Saturday concerts.

645
00:31:09,654 --> 00:31:12,280
Rym: I have skipped more of the Friday concerts.

646
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,279
Rym: I kind of want to go to the Friday concert.

647
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:16,259
Scott: What Friday concert do you want to see?

648
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:17,268
Scott: I don't know.

649
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,533
Scott: The only new group is Super Commuter.

650
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:21,210
Scott: And actually, Super Commuter is pretty good.

651
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:23,169
Scott: It's hip-hop over 8-bit backbeats.

652
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:24,380
Scott: I went to their website.

653
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,736
Scott: I dig what they were doing.

654
00:31:25,777 --> 00:31:29,840
Scott: But, I don't really need to skip hours of awesome gaming.

655
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,250
Rym: You seem to think that I'm going to go to the entire concert from the beginning.

656
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:42,140
Rym: I'm going to do what we did at our first Pac's, which was walk into the concert a little late, and leave the concert when I've gotten my fill.

657
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:47,130
Scott: I'm gonna get my fill at the from Friday.

658
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:49,271
Rym: Well, the JoCo Mini Cruise.

659
00:31:49,412 --> 00:32:01,126
Rym: So, if you want to hang out with me and Scott, in a place on a boat in New York next Friday, if tickets aren't sold out, we will be there.

660
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:01,591
Rym: You know what?

661
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:05,049
Rym: There's nothing to do on that boat, but listen to JoCo and hang out.

662
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:05,959
Scott: Hang out on a boat.

663
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,655
Rym: Play some Spotted on that boat.

664
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:08,767
Scott: Fucking mermaid.

665
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:09,899
Rym: Shit on Debra's desk.

666
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,818
Scott: No, wrong song.

667
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:14,894
Scott: Uh, what else?

668
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,924
Scott: That's it.

669
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:18,070
Scott: No, this board game night is this Friday.

670
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:18,514
Rym: Oh, yes.

671
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:26,916
Rym: Tomorrow we will be at Think Coffee on Mercer Street for NerdNYC board gaming, which has had a surprising number of GeekNights listeners showing up.

672
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:28,700
Scott: It's getting a much bigger turnout over time.

673
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Rym: It's getting to the point to where I almost feel like we need to get all the GeekNights people and have a separate gaming night that's offset from the NerdNYC.

674
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,434
Scott: Yeah, also, I just want to remind you that...

675
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,392
Rym: I had a sunflower received, like, in my throat.

676
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:40,614
Rym: Good.

677
00:32:40,694 --> 00:32:54,050
Scott: We are all over the internets on the Facebooks and Twitters and our official website and our forum and everything, so you should come and participate with us on the internets and every place that we are on the internets, because the internets work like that.

678
00:32:54,312 --> 00:32:56,311
Scott: And if you like us, you should like us on the internets.

679
00:32:56,776 --> 00:33:02,639
Rym: And one last thing, we have put up two of our Penny Arcade Expo East 2011 panels on YouTube.

680
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:05,039
Rym: You should probably watch them.

681
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:10,757
Rym: You'll notice I put up that Enforcer shoutout where we talked about how great the Enforcers were.

682
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:18,920
Rym: Notice how if you watch Game Mechanics and Mechanism Design, it starts this video with riotous applause.

683
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,979
Rym: And then we introduce ourselves.

684
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,246
Rym: It cheated.

685
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:29,439
Rym: Those riotous applause were, in fact, for the Enforcer shoutout a moment before and not, in fact, for us coming up on stage.

686
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:31,220
Rym: You see what I did there?

687
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,220
Scott: But you pulled a Scott move in admitting what you did there.

688
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:42,539
Scott: The Rym move would usually be to let the secret technique and deception lie as it stands.

689
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:46,776
Scott: It's the Scott technique to expose the deception.

690
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,520
Rym: Here is a question.

691
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,840
Rym: How is it deception to show the unedited fact of a situation?

692
00:33:56,268 --> 00:34:06,700
Rym: There's video, which includes 20 minutes of us just setting stuff up on stage and ends with 10 minutes of us taking questions and cleaning up the room and everything.

693
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:10,639
Rym: And I just picked an arbitrary point of that and showed it uninterrupted.

694
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,002
Scott: Uh huh.

695
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:13,080
Scott: See, that's the Rym move.

696
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,132
Rym: Where's the deception?

697
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:14,719
Rym: Where's the lie?

698
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,031
Scott: That's the Rym move right there.

699
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:17,908
Rym: How have I deceived by showing truth?

700
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:20,458
Scott: You have obviously not turned into Scott.

701
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:22,839
Scott: And you have just proved it.

702
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:31,867
Scott: So, you know, I follow a lot of people on Twitters and occasionally, you know, people say things and you see them and you go, "Oh, I should check that

703
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:32,130
Scott: out.".

704
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,139
Scott: You forget to check that out.

705
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:41,625
Rym: Yeah, I made a thing that will, it scrapes my Twitter, the things coming at me that I'm subscribed to, for links and puts them in a feed that I can then consume.

706
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:42,089
Rym: Yeah.

707
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:44,572
Rym: And I even then forget to check on things.

708
00:34:44,654 --> 00:34:49,100
Scott: But sometimes, someone will re-mention something enough times that you won't forget it.

709
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,029
Scott: It'll stick in your brain.

710
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,969
Scott: Hey, marketers, that's the secret repetition.

711
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,192
Scott: Head on.

712
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,540
Rym: Apply directly to the forehead.

713
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,484
Scott: Gavo.

714
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:55,971
Scott: Gavo.

715
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:56,498
Scott: Gavo.

716
00:34:57,523 --> 00:35:08,840
Scott: So, one thing that I kept seeing come up over and over again and mentioned by many different people I follow on Twitter such as Neil Gaiman and Penn Gillette and Teller, who was involved in this thing, was Playdead.

717
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,068
Scott: And it just so happened.

718
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:17,463
Scott: Playdead was an off-Broadway production made by Teller and also Todd Robbins and a bunch of other people.

719
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:19,887
Scott: that was in New York City.

720
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:22,754
Scott: So, it was like, "Hey, that sounds like a good thing to

721
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:22,915
Scott: me.".

722
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,645
Scott: And, you know, people who went to see it would tweet and be like, "Oh, man, that was so

723
00:35:27,766 --> 00:35:28,089
Scott: awesome.".

724
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:29,909
Scott: And so I'm like, "I'm going to check this thing

725
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:30,091
Scott: out.".

726
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:38,679
Scott: So, you know, I told my mom about it and told a whole bunch of other people and then, you know, my mom was like, she wanted to see it because that's her kind of thing, you know.

727
00:35:39,162 --> 00:35:42,252
Scott: I didn't know anything about it other than it was an off-Broadway show.

728
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:48,780
Scott: Teller was involved and it was called Playdead and the logo had like a skull on it.

729
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:49,464
Scott: I was like,

730
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:49,727
Scott: "Ooh.".

731
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:56,676
Rym: Well, notice, now that I look at it, it's a skull coming out of the smoke of a broken light bulb, which is very important to the show.

732
00:35:56,736 --> 00:35:57,019
Rym: It is.

733
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,844
Scott: I think that's actually a more recent logo.

734
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:00,330
Scott: I'm not sure.

735
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:00,715
Scott: I don't know.

736
00:36:00,735 --> 00:36:06,068
Scott: Regardless, I went with my family to see it because my mom really wanted to see it and she says, "Hey, are we going to go see that

737
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:06,311
Scott: thing?".

738
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:09,360
Scott: And it actually got extended a whole bunch, so we were able to go see it.

739
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:10,591
Scott: You know, it wasn't sold out.

740
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:11,743
Scott: It was in a very tiny theater.

741
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:14,959
Scott: You just walk up, buy some tickets, walk right in, sit wherever you like.

742
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,159
Scott: You know, it's all good.

743
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,815
Scott: And I saw it and I was very surprised.

744
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:24,086
Scott: Well, I mean, I expected it to be good, but it was actually quite excellent.

745
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:25,863
Scott: I enjoyed it very much.

746
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:27,600
Rym: Yep, it wasn't the greatest thing ever.

747
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,207
Scott: No, I mean, Book of Mormon is the greatest thing ever.

748
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:30,914
Scott: Stage shows.

749
00:36:30,995 --> 00:36:33,258
Rym: I've seen, I mean, I've seen a lot of stage shows.

750
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:34,248
Rym: I can tell by the pixels.

751
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:34,835
Rym: Yeah.

752
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:36,651
Rym: So, Scott was like, "Hey, it was pretty good.

753
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:37,076
Rym: You should see

754
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:37,157
Rym: it.".

755
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:38,289
Rym: My mom liked it, too.

756
00:36:38,451 --> 00:36:39,825
Rym: So, I forgot.

757
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:44,995
Rym: And then one day, I look and it's going to end, like the run's going to end, like, that weekend.

758
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:45,621
Rym: And I'm like,

759
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:46,571
Rym: "Alright!".

760
00:36:46,632 --> 00:36:48,855
Rym: And I bought tickets that morning and Emily and I went to see it.

761
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:49,118
Rym: Yep.

762
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:51,014
Rym: And it was pretty good.

763
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:54,368
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, Book of Mormon is the greatest show there is.

764
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:57,600
Scott: Well, the thing is, but this is still, it's like totally worth seeing.

765
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,307
Rym: I think the main reason I liked it is something very specific in the beginning.

766
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:05,985
Rym: That, you know, we sit in and there's this warning that the lights will go out completely.

767
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:07,136
Rym: Like, "It's got to be dark.

768
00:37:07,156 --> 00:37:09,036
Rym: If you can't handle that shit, well, don't come in

769
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:09,197
Rym: here.".

770
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,280
Rym: And, you know, the lights go dark right away during the play.

771
00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:15,318
Rym: And the exit signs are still on.

772
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:17,723
Rym: And I'm like, "Ah, it's always like

773
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:18,046
Rym: that.".

774
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,803
Rym: And I know everyone was thinking that.

775
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:24,388
Scott: And then the guy on stage is like... Well, I mean, you're in a basically, a completely pitch-back room except for exit signs.

776
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,680
Scott: It's the only thing there is to look at.

777
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,904
Scott: Of course, everyone is looking at it, right?

778
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:30,816
Scott: That is the magic the teller brought to this show, right?

779
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:34,611
Scott: Is that magician's knowledge of knowing where you're going to look at all times.

780
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:35,923
Scott: What you're going to pay attention to.

781
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:37,134
Scott: All that kind of stuff.

782
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:38,651
Rym: And then when the guy's like, "Oh, hold on a

783
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:38,873
Rym: minute."

784
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:40,672
Rym: And then he turns off the exit signs.

785
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,943
Rym: That's when I knew I was, I did not expect that.

786
00:37:44,065 --> 00:37:45,216
Scott: Yeah, I did not expect that either.

787
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:48,635
Scott: But the fact that the exit signs actually turned off and stayed off, I was like, "Fuck

788
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:48,898
Scott: yeah.".

789
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:55,845
Scott: But basically, you know, in short, Play Dead is a haunted house where you, well, a haunted show.

790
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:56,713
Scott: One man show.

791
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:57,945
Scott: Mostly one man.

792
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:01,117
Scott: And it actually sort of works on adults.

793
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:08,187
Scott: It's like even though you know, right, that they're not actually ghosts coming through and possessing or whatever the fuck they're going to do.

794
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:09,360
Scott: Or people getting killed.

795
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:11,020
Scott: You know, all the blood is fake.

796
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:12,592
Scott: You know all that.

797
00:38:13,118 --> 00:38:16,632
Scott: And it usually, when you go to a cheesy haunted house it's like, "Frankenstein's Haunted

798
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:17,340
Scott: Mansion.".

799
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:20,106
Scott: It's like, "Okay guys, seriously lol.

800
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:22,086
Scott: Put your hands in the bowl of

801
00:38:22,106 --> 00:38:23,157
Scott: spaghetti.".

802
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:23,761
Scott: It's like, "Yeah,

803
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:24,064
Scott: great.".

804
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:28,431
Scott: But this is all, this is basically like, you know it's fake but it happens and you're like,

805
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:28,531
Scott: "Woo.".

806
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,470
Scott: And then you're like, "Oh, they just threw some rice at me.

807
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,500
Scott: Okay, whatever.

808
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:34,766
Rym: Woo.".

809
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:40,390
Scott: Because it's, you know, it's constructed in such an awesome way that it totally works.

810
00:38:40,592 --> 00:38:50,170
Rym: It was cool that it was part like history lesson, part stage show, like straight up magic, part haunted house, and I really like the history part.

811
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,544
Rym: Like I knew about Albert Fish.

812
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:56,519
Rym: I think anyone who gets bored at work eventually hits Albert Fish's Wikipedia page.

813
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,659
Scott: You've got to be really bored to end up there.

814
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:06,131
Rym: It's pretty easy to get there because a lot of pages end up going to Serial Killer and from there it's a short step to Albert Fish.

815
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:08,253
Scott: Wow, what are you reading on Wikipedia?

816
00:39:08,273 --> 00:39:10,595
Rym: Apparently Albert Fish and Serial Killers.

817
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:11,655
Scott: Yeah, I guess so.

818
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,988
Rym: But, and then I knew about him, but I didn't know about all those mediums.

819
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:19,625
Rym: I really like the sexy medium.

820
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:20,333
Scott: Yeah, right.

821
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:21,545
Rym: That was kind of funny actually.

822
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:24,592
Scott: But basically, so I don't want to spoil the show, right?

823
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:29,039
Rym: Especially because as we just learned, it's getting a revival already, like a second run.

824
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,857
Scott: Well, that's another thing I was going to say, right?

825
00:39:30,898 --> 00:39:32,938
Scott: So you might be like, "Why are you telling me about this show?

826
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:33,322
Scott: I can't

827
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:33,666
Scott: see.".

828
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:40,572
Scott: Well, even though the show ended, if you go to the official website, it says there's not much information, but it says "Rising for Halloween.

829
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:42,552
Scott: Performances start October 7th.

830
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:44,069
Scott: Stay connected with Facebook and Twitter.

831
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:44,453
Scott: Join our

832
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:44,917
Scott: newsletter.".

833
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:51,540
Scott: So it is very likely that this will appear again and you will be able to see it depending on your geographic location.

834
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,724
Rym: It's also, it's got a healthy dose of sideshow because Todd Robbins, he eats a lightbulb on stage.

835
00:39:57,885 --> 00:39:59,017
Scott: He's really eating a lightbulb.

836
00:39:59,118 --> 00:39:59,300
Rym: Yeah.

837
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,887
Scott: And it's funny, I guess That's his thing.

838
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:11,459
Rym: I realize that because we listened to Penn Radio for so long, I think we know, like, it surprises me how much I know about the stagecraft of, like, sideshows and things.

839
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,865
Scott: Well, yeah, that's, you know, that's what happens.

840
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:15,424
Rym: But, I mean, the average person doesn't.

841
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:18,476
Rym: Like, the people in the audience walking around like, "No, here, check it

842
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:18,638
Rym: out.".

843
00:40:18,658 --> 00:40:20,374
Rym: He's like handing people the broken glass.

844
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:21,646
Rym: They can't figure it out.

845
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:22,838
Rym: They're like, "Oh, it's got to be a trick.

846
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:23,161
Rym: Ah, I

847
00:40:23,222 --> 00:40:23,464
Rym: can't.".

848
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,059
Rym: He's not just eating a lightbulb.

849
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,826
Rym: Who would do that?

850
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:27,179
Scott: He's eating a lightbulb.

851
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:29,199
Rym: It's not that hard to eat a lightbulb.

852
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:30,331
Scott: I wouldn't do it.

853
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:31,000
Scott: I wouldn't do it either.

854
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,807
Scott: But that guy can do it.

855
00:40:31,868 --> 00:40:32,655
Scott: It's doable.

856
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:33,544
Scott: It is indeed.

857
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:42,412
Scott: Anyway, so the structure of the show, I don't want to actually go into any specific things that might, you know, you know, ruin the show.

858
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:54,109
Scott: Because it is, you know, I do often say when it comes to spoilers, like, look, if something depends only on the element of surprise, and thus it can be completely spoiled just by knowing information, how good is that thing really?

859
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:55,846
Rym: But, I mean, a haunted house boo show.

860
00:40:56,028 --> 00:41:00,189
Scott: But this isn't, this isn't a matter of spoiling in terms of surprise.

861
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,825
Scott: Like, oh, the surprises won't work.

862
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:06,840
Scott: This is a matter of, you know, behind the curtain, you know, Wizard of Oz situation.

863
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:08,820
Scott: Which is a different sort of spoiler.

864
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,583
Rym: Here's an example of something, I can spoil what happens, but yet it won't actually ruin the event.

865
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:20,817
Rym: So when the lights are totally off in the beginning, he just starts talking about how in the darkness people can do whatever the fuck they want, and you don't know who did it.

866
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:26,372
Rym: And, pretty much, he knew, and it's true, that this will always happen.

867
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:28,292
Rym: People in the audience start fucking with each other.

868
00:41:28,312 --> 00:41:29,200
Scott: Yeah, that's intentional.

869
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,129
Scott: Yeah, like, some stranger just, like, will be in the back of the head.

870
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:34,452
Scott: It is completely pitch black.

871
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:35,967
Scott: You can see nothing.

872
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:38,959
Scott: It is black black, not a photon in the room.

873
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,330
Rym: None more black.

874
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:47,460
Scott: They make you turn off every light emitting device that you might bring with you, be it, you know, glowy wristwatch or cell phone.

875
00:41:48,045 --> 00:41:52,735
Scott: So there is nothing, you cannot see a thing without some sort of light source.

876
00:41:52,937 --> 00:41:59,199
Rym: But it's interesting how little prompting it takes to get people to basically just start fucking with strangers in the dark.

877
00:41:59,442 --> 00:42:02,575
Scott: Yeah, well, you're probably most likely to fuck with the people you know.

878
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:05,215
Rym: No, it's the guy behind me just, like, grabbed my hair, like,

879
00:42:05,235 --> 00:42:05,436
Rym: "Woo!".

880
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:10,151
Scott: He probably was looking at your hair the whole time and was like, "I gotta touch that

881
00:42:10,212 --> 00:42:10,395
Scott: hair.".

882
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,100
Rym: It's such good stagecraft.

883
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:15,160
Rym: I don't want to spoil the thing, but it's got the crow.

884
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:16,105
Scott: Yeah.

885
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:16,632
Rym: Yeah.

886
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:18,068
Rym: Every time I looked at it, I'm like, "Wait a

887
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:18,311
Rym: minute.".

888
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:24,979
Scott: But basically, the structure of the show is you have this one guy, Todd Robbins, and he's sort of like your host for the evening.

889
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:31,400
Scott: And he basically presents to you these dead people that he has in these boxes.

890
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:41,256
Scott: And he tells a story about each dead person, and then the stories sort of unfold into things that happen.

891
00:42:41,276 --> 00:42:41,337
Scott: Yep.

892
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,569
Rym: And some of them are like, "Oh, here's the history lesson about sideshows.

893
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:52,325
Rym: Oh, I love how he does two different mediums, and how the one who is sexy is portrayed kind of like this funny, kind of cool

894
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:52,628
Rym: thing."

895
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:58,273
Rym: Like, you can see, like, obviously these were just a bunch of people in Boston looking for an excuse to have some sexy time.

896
00:42:58,435 --> 00:42:58,699
Scott: Yep.

897
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,391
Rym: And yet, the other medium...

898
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,805
Scott: The fat, bitchy Italian one?

899
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:04,435
Scott: Yeah, that he portrays as an evil bitch.

900
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:10,145
Rym: As a horrible, evil bitch, even though she didn't murder anyone compared to Albert Fish, who murdered a whole bunch of people.

901
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:14,044
Scott: Yeah, I would definitely say Albert Fish's worst, not to say that the fat Italian lady wasn't.

902
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:17,320
Rym: But notice how he doesn't call Albert Fish evil.

903
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:23,180
Rym: He calls him lots of things and goes into the horrible things he did, but he reserves that word for the other lady.

904
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:23,665
Rym: Yeah.

905
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,966
Scott: Well, I think it's Albert Fish most likely wasn't, you know... He wasn't evil, he was crazy.

906
00:43:27,987 --> 00:43:30,330
Scott: Yeah, he wasn't consciously malicious, right?

907
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,967
Scott: He wasn't on purpose hurting people.

908
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:35,765
Scott: I mean, he was on purpose hurting people because he was nuts, like, he couldn't control it.

909
00:43:35,805 --> 00:43:40,840
Scott: Not because he was trying to actively scam people, you know, consciously.

910
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,331
Scott: There's a difference, right?

911
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:43,300
Scott: Anyway.

912
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:43,912
Scott: Anyway.

913
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:46,840
Scott: So, what else do you say about the show?

914
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,735
Rym: Well, I mean, it just kind of goes from there, and it's, like I said, it's not the greatest stage show.

915
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:52,459
Rym: Don't buy the expensive tickets.

916
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:54,960
Scott: Is there a difference between the expensive tickets?

917
00:43:55,381 --> 00:43:56,555
Rym: You sit closer.

918
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:56,979
Scott: That's it.

919
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,008
Scott: You don't need to sit closer.

920
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:01,320
Scott: The place that it was in, at least before, I don't know if it'll be in a different place in the future.

921
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,419
Rym: No, they do involve the audience.

922
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:03,768
Scott: Quite a bit.

923
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,800
Scott: My brother went on stage.

924
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,202
Rym: Really?

925
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,213
Rym: Which one was he?

926
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:06,780
Scott: The Ouija board.

927
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:08,491
Scott: Not that exciting.

928
00:44:08,572 --> 00:44:11,140
Rym: The thing is, the Ouija board, I was like, okay, I see what's going on here.

929
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:14,779
Rym: But then, the table, I wasn't really sure how they did it.

930
00:44:15,063 --> 00:44:15,957
Scott: I could tell you how they did it.

931
00:44:15,997 --> 00:44:16,099
Scott: No.

932
00:44:16,962 --> 00:44:18,896
Rym: I really liked the contrast.

933
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:25,519
Rym: I think we talked about this when we mentioned the show briefly, where he acts like he's gonna murder the rat, and the audience flips out.

934
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,086
Rym: And then he totally fucking murders the person, and no one cares.

935
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:28,672
Rym: They're laughing.

936
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:30,127
Rym: Like, haha, you killed that guy.

937
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:33,500
Scott: Yeah, it's full of that dark humor kind of joke, right?

938
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:47,060
Scott: It's that weird, it's like, humor plus horror at the same time, plus thrills and chills, and also, you know, illusion, all mixed into one, you know, thing together.

939
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:48,860
Rym: There is also some sexy time.

940
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,900
Scott: Yeah, it's like this, it's this combination of many things boiled into a pot.

941
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,554
Rym: I love his presentation, too.

942
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:57,060
Rym: Todd Robbins is just, he's great at that.

943
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,108
Rym: Yeah, high skills.

944
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,375
Rym: Well, cause he plays the very, like the white suited gentleman.

945
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:00,759
Scott: Yep.

946
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,358
Scott: And then, before he wipes blood all over it.

947
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,159
Rym: Yeah, all over.

948
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,619
Scott: It was good times.

949
00:45:08,145 --> 00:45:17,100
Rym: In general, I don't know, any of you out there, listeners, who live in a city of any size, I mean, even Beacon had a pretty thriving theater community.

950
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:25,584
Scott: Yeah, it's like, even if you're in some middle of nowhere, right, there's always gonna be some tiny community theater that puts something on.

951
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:27,866
Scott: In fact, remember, we went up and saw... Even if it's just like a Shakespeare.

952
00:45:27,886 --> 00:45:31,220
Rym: Our good friend Kate and the front row crew was in a play up in Albany, we went to see it.

953
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,865
Scott: I didn't go see it.

954
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:33,180
Rym: Oh, you didn't, everyone else did.

955
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,460
Rym: It was pretty damn great.

956
00:45:35,423 --> 00:45:38,071
Scott: We saw, like, RIT players at RIT.

957
00:45:38,212 --> 00:45:40,353
Rym: Oh yeah, they did Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

958
00:45:40,393 --> 00:45:41,140
Scott: They did a pretty good job.

959
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,229
Scott: Yeah.

960
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,949
Scott: My high school did pretty good plays.

961
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:44,799
Scott: Mine did.

962
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,584
Scott: What did they do?

963
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,603
Scott: What's the one where you shuffle off to Buffalo?

964
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:48,270
Scott: That's the one they did.

965
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:49,320
Scott: I forget what that's called.

966
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,017
Scott: With the boat.

967
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,251
Rym: Shuffle off to Buffalo?

968
00:45:52,272 --> 00:45:52,960
Rym: That's the song.

969
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,660
Scott: What the fuck is that?

970
00:45:55,944 --> 00:45:56,249
Scott: 42nd Street?

971
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:56,980
Scott: I think that's what it is.

972
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,119
Rym: We did Chicago, but I didn't bother with it.

973
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:06,673
Rym: And we did Damn Yankees, which was... I kind of like Damn Yankees as a kind of dopey, old style musical.

974
00:46:06,714 --> 00:46:08,575
Scott: Yes, it's 42nd Street is the one we shuffle off to Buffalo.

975
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:09,787
Rym: I've never seen 42nd Street.

976
00:46:09,928 --> 00:46:10,271
Scott: It's okay.

977
00:46:10,715 --> 00:46:11,846
Scott: My high school did a pretty good job.

978
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:17,639
Scott: It's basically like if the high school had upgraded, like two steps, it would have basically been a Broadway show that had a low budget.

979
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:21,020
Rym: But go to local theaters.

980
00:46:21,422 --> 00:46:22,250
Rym: It's so cheap.

981
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:25,400
Rym: It's like five bucks in some towns to see a live play.

982
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:25,945
Rym: And you know what?

983
00:46:26,573 --> 00:46:30,170
Rym: Even the crappiest live play, unless it's in middle school, is pretty good.

984
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:36,720
Scott: Yeah, because I mean the people who do these things, the people who really care about it and really try, and it's very rare that it's going to be painfully bad.

985
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:43,541
Scott: And the thing is, the fact that some of the worst shows you can see are usually like Spider-Man, right?

986
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:47,399
Scott: It's a big, big production that just happens to suck, that someone invested a lot in.

987
00:46:47,921 --> 00:46:54,579
Scott: You know, the local community is probably doing some tried and trusted play that you know is good.

988
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,168
Scott: That's very old and in the public domain or something like that.

989
00:46:58,431 --> 00:47:00,009
Rym: Or especially things that are really good.

990
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:00,759
Rym: Like a Shakespeare or something.

991
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,617
Rym: But you probably haven't seen or read.

992
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:04,613
Rym: Like, I went to see with Emily a few years ago.

993
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:05,723
Rym: Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?

994
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:07,140
Rym: Just in the city, off-Broadway.

995
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:08,700
Rym: It was great.

996
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,047
Scott: Yeah, of course it's great.

997
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:11,420
Rym: Yeah, well it's a great play anyway.

998
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,240
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

999
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:17,380
Rym: In general, I've always been a huge fan of one-room acts, like one-room plays.

1000
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,490
Scott: Oh yeah, you can go see Glass Menagerie or Death of a Salesman.

1001
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:23,500
Scott: I think Death of a Salesman has two rooms, because there's an outside the house.

1002
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,490
Scott: Yeah, technically.

1003
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,593
Scott: I don't know, but yeah, it's mostly one room.

1004
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:31,720
Rym: The thing is, the way I've always seen it done, is the outside is in a set... Through the window?

1005
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,793
Rym: Yes, through a screen.

1006
00:47:32,915 --> 00:47:34,579
Scott: I've seen through the window trick before.

1007
00:47:34,983 --> 00:47:45,469
Rym: Noises Off is interesting, that it's a one-room play, but the movie shows you the front, you know, where the audience can see, but then it also shows you the back, where the audience can't see.

1008
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:48,759
Rym: But the play in the play, Yo Dawg, is a one room.

1009
00:47:50,964 --> 00:47:54,719
Rym: Oh man, Glass Menagerie, I'm suddenly like, I suddenly want to go see a play, like right now.

1010
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:56,400
Scott: Go see the Book of Mormon.

1011
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:58,658
Rym: I saw it.

1012
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:00,899
Scott: I'd go see it again, if I could.

1013
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,469
Rym: Yeah, well, there are tickets free in February.

1014
00:48:04,056 --> 00:48:04,239
Scott: Free?

1015
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,832
Rym: As in, you can buy them.

1016
00:48:05,852 --> 00:48:07,407
Scott: Oh, yeah, you should do that.

1017
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:07,852
Rym: I should.

1018
00:48:08,075 --> 00:48:08,540
Scott: Right now.

1019
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,266
Rym: I probably will.

1020
00:48:09,326 --> 00:48:12,315
Scott: Otherwise, you're probably not going to see the original cast, though.

1021
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:13,062
Rym: I don't care.

1022
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,052
Scott: Who knows at this point?

1023
00:48:14,355 --> 00:48:15,243
Rym: I've learned in my life.

1024
00:48:15,304 --> 00:48:18,400
Scott: Actually, February's getting pretty close, and I'm pretty sure the original cast is still there.

1025
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,871
Rym: Yeah, but like, Les Miserables had like a million different casts.

1026
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:27,932
Rym: It doesn't matter for some plays, because if a play is that big, they're going to get people who are good enough to where you won't notice.

1027
00:48:27,993 --> 00:48:31,167
Scott: I'm sure, I mean, they're already going to do Book of Mormon in London and all these other places.

1028
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:36,277
Rym: Well, Scott, like springtime for Hitler, Matthew Broderick was off of that for a long time, and it was still super good.

1029
00:48:36,418 --> 00:48:42,660
Scott: Right, but the point is, like, you know, having seen the Book of Mormon, it's like I just couldn't imagine it with someone else, right?

1030
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,811
Scott: Because I saw the original one.

1031
00:48:43,832 --> 00:48:44,660
Rym: Scott, I had that problem.

1032
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,287
Rym: I saw Les Miserables with like the international touring cast, where they sounded like it was the CD.

1033
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:50,420
Rym: Like, it was perfect.

1034
00:48:51,123 --> 00:49:07,610
Rym: And then I saw it years later, you know, kind of like a revival thing, and it was a totally different cast, and the only time it stood out like that it was different, like where I was like, ah, was there was one song near the beginning where like the cadence was a little different, but otherwise it was great.

1035
00:49:07,671 --> 00:49:07,933
Rym: It was fine.

1036
00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:11,406
Scott: Actually, you're right, because I did, I heard the Les Mis CD before ever seeing it.

1037
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:12,980
Scott: Actually, dual cassette tape.

1038
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,238
Rym: Oh, shit, son.

1039
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:14,340
Scott: Shit.

1040
00:49:14,562 --> 00:49:17,612
Scott: And I did go to see it on Broadway, right?

1041
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:30,359
Rym: See, I saw the, because interestingly for shows like that, you sometimes get a better performance outside of New York just because the best cast does the world tour of like one weekend in every city.

1042
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,940
Scott: Sometimes, sometimes not.

1043
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:39,529
Scott: But it's like, I did see it on Broadway and it was definitely not any of the original people, but I didn't notice a fucking difference.

1044
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:39,772
Rym: Yeah.

1045
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:52,180
Rym: I must have been in high school, middle school- Oh, the only other difference I noticed is the, when they're doing the song with cassette, the actor started to say Colette and corrected himself, but obviously- I make that mistake.

1046
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:56,500
Rym: Yeah, but it was obviously on purpose because it was played up for a laugh and there were canned responses.

1047
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:08,014
Scott: Plus, the other thing is, right, when I went to see it, even though it was not the original cast, there's always, even if it's not the original cast, there's always going to be someone who brings something special, right?

1048
00:50:08,095 --> 00:50:11,369
Scott: When I saw it, the master of the house was the best.

1049
00:50:11,672 --> 00:50:16,260
Scott: He was like this unbelievably odd, like he was born to be the master of the house.

1050
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:19,774
Scott: But at the same time- People applauded for him more than anyone fucking else.

1051
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:21,530
Scott: It was just like, "Oh my god, that guy was so

1052
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:21,874
Scott: great.".

1053
00:50:22,015 --> 00:50:24,398
Rym: I've actually seen Les Miserables three times.

1054
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:28,119
Rym: One time I got to go for free, like shortly after I'd seen it, so I just went again.

1055
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:33,410
Rym: Yeah, because in high school I went to a million fucking musicals in like the- But in Detroit, though.

1056
00:50:33,676 --> 00:50:33,819
Scott: Yeah.

1057
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:37,840
Rym: But they were all like the touring musicals coming into the Masonic temple or whatever.

1058
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:45,451
Rym: And all three times, two different masters of the house got the most applause every time.

1059
00:50:45,795 --> 00:50:46,300
Rym: Same deal.

1060
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,833
Rym: I think it's just that role is great.

1061
00:50:47,853 --> 00:50:49,999
Scott: No, but the guy was just so good at it, though.

1062
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:51,653
Scott: It can't be easy to do.

1063
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,500
Rym: I couldn't do it.

1064
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,740
Rym: Come on, isn't it worth me to spit?

1065
00:50:55,715 --> 00:51:01,760
Scott: No, but I mean it was actually, he was funnier, you know ours is a song, but the guy has actual lines outside of the song.

1066
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,495
Rym: People always seem to, a lot of people I've met who don't go to see musicals.

1067
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:09,354
Scott: And his physical comedy, he was almost Kramer level.

1068
00:51:09,556 --> 00:51:09,920
Rym: Oh man.

1069
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,160
Scott: And he had that same build as Kramer.

1070
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,060
Rym: I have met multiple people in my life, Scott.

1071
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:16,239
Scott: And the costume with the funny shoes.

1072
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:23,639
Rym: Who didn't realize there were acting scenes between the musical parts of musicals.

1073
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,660
Scott: Okay, listen, it's a musical, it's not an opera.

1074
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,640
Scott: Operas are singing a hundred percent.

1075
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,943
Scott: Musicals, they do things between the singers.

1076
00:51:29,964 --> 00:51:30,959
Scott: Yeah, there's a story.

1077
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,600
Scott: It's a play, and then a song, and then a play, and then a song.

1078
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:34,715
Scott: That's a musical.

1079
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:34,939
Scott: Yep.

1080
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:38,025
Scott: If it was just singing the whole time, it would be called an opera.

1081
00:51:38,872 --> 00:51:39,660
Scott: That's how it is.

1082
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,979
Scott: I'm not even a theater person.

1083
00:51:41,622 --> 00:51:42,559
Rym: Perhaps a review.

1084
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,863
Scott: Well, a review I don't think has a story, right?

1085
00:51:45,924 --> 00:51:46,105
Scott: No.

1086
00:51:46,307 --> 00:51:49,518
Rym: It's just a bunch of unrelated songs, or loosely related songs.

1087
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,654
Rym: You'll get some sort of like Appalachian melodies or something.

1088
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:56,449
Scott: It's like, here's twenty song and dance numbers that are loosely related in an order.

1089
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:56,833
Rym: Yep.

1090
00:51:56,975 --> 00:51:57,338
Scott: Let's do them.

1091
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,920
Rym: Or go see a cabaret.

1092
00:52:00,101 --> 00:52:01,866
Scott: Or you can go see cabaret.

1093
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:02,454
Scott: Yeah.

1094
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:02,839
Scott: Period.

1095
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,027
Rym: Which is not the same as a cabaret.

1096
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:08,855
Scott: Actually, if you want to see cabaret, the movie is actually fantastic.

1097
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:09,179
Scott: It is.

1098
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,212
Rym: Actually, a lot of those, like Chicago was a pretty good movie, too.

1099
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:12,599
Rym: Pretty good.

1100
00:52:13,084 --> 00:52:13,326
Scott: Yeah.

1101
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,118
Scott: Actually, Chicago is still playing like right across the street from my work.

1102
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,760
Scott: And it's kind of weird because I'm like, you know, I could go see it anytime I wanted, basically.

1103
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,408
Scott: But it's like, all they really do with Chicago is they keep cycling out famous people.

1104
00:52:25,488 --> 00:52:31,245
Scott: It's like, the sign outside is always like, this is the famous person who's currently playing the main girl in Chicago.

1105
00:52:31,265 --> 00:52:32,276
Scott: Well, come see it.

1106
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:34,460
Scott: And it's always they change it like every few months.

1107
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:39,912
Scott: And it's like, guess some out of work Hollywood person needs something to do before their next movie deal.

1108
00:52:39,953 --> 00:52:45,850
Scott: So they go to Chicago and that lets them bring in some extra ticket sales because the fans of that person come in.

1109
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,779
Rym: I would wager.

1110
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:51,386
Rym: what's going on there is that I think a lot of people have never seen a musical.

1111
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:53,104
Rym: They don't really like know what a musical like.

1112
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,478
Rym: They don't really know what they're like.

1113
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:55,023
Rym: Yeah.

1114
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:59,793
Rym: So famous person in Chicago is just to trick some tourists into coming and seeing a musical.

1115
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:00,520
Scott: Yeah.

1116
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:00,982
Rym: Yeah.

1117
00:53:01,528 --> 00:53:02,135
Rym: And I think that's it.

1118
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:04,740
Scott: Anyway, but that's that seems to be the way that they roll.

1119
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,660
Scott: Every every show seems to roll differently.

1120
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,651
Scott: You know, there's the shows like Rock of Ages of the Beatles show.

1121
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,571
Scott: I think the Beatles show closed or is closing.

1122
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:16,156
Rym: I haven't seen like Joseph the Technicolor Dreamcoat was like forever and I don't see it anymore.

1123
00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:21,752
Scott: No, but shows like that is what they do is they use music people are already familiar with.

1124
00:53:22,055 --> 00:53:23,388
Scott: So it's like going to see a concert.

1125
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:26,559
Scott: It's like we're going to sing a bunch of 80s rock tunes that you already know.

1126
00:53:26,963 --> 00:53:28,699
Scott: So it won't be unfamiliar or weird to you.

1127
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,788
Rym: That Beatles one.

1128
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:32,257
Rym: I'm not I don't I'm not feeling that.

1129
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:32,317
Scott: No.

1130
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,177
Scott: But, you know, of course, the thing is those things don't actually win.

1131
00:53:36,217 --> 00:53:43,469
Scott: The only one of those I see around that's actually like still kicking is Mamma Mia, which is all the Ava songs.

1132
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:44,500
Scott: And then The Lion King.

1133
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:46,340
Scott: does that really count in that category?

1134
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:46,883
Scott: Kind of.

1135
00:53:47,246 --> 00:53:47,570
Scott: Right.

1136
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,640
Scott: Lion King is weird.

1137
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,843
Scott: I think I don't know if Mary Poppins is still over there.

1138
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:51,571
Scott: I think it might be.

1139
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:52,380
Rym: It comes and goes.

1140
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:53,732
Scott: I'd imagine.

1141
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:54,682
Scott: I haven't paid that.

1142
00:53:54,803 --> 00:53:55,793
Scott: I work at Broadway.com.

1143
00:53:55,814 --> 00:53:56,844
Scott: I haven't paid that much attention.

1144
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:57,450
Rym: There's the other.

1145
00:53:57,895 --> 00:54:07,994
Rym: To this day, a special place in my heart exists for Moulin Rouge because it's like a musical that was designed to be a movie like it couldn't be performed on a stage.

1146
00:54:08,055 --> 00:54:10,846
Scott: The point is Book of Mormon is the best I've ever seen.

1147
00:54:10,866 --> 00:54:14,679
Scott: And also, you should go see Playdead if it comes back.

1148
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:16,280
Scott: And it looks like it's gonna.

1149
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:16,763
Rym: You know what?

1150
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:23,004
Rym: Playdead is a great thing to bring a significant other to if you're a young punk kid.

1151
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:25,550
Scott: Especially if they are easily timid.

1152
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:25,995
Scott: Yes.

1153
00:54:26,237 --> 00:54:26,560
Rym: Yes.

1154
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,834
Rym: It is also great to bring your parents to.

1155
00:54:29,854 --> 00:54:29,935
Rym: Yeah.

1156
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:31,671
Scott: If your parents are cool.

1157
00:54:31,691 --> 00:54:36,622
Rym: Even if they're not cool, it's hard to not chuckle at what's going on.

1158
00:54:36,683 --> 00:54:37,834
Scott: Also, cool grandpa.

1159
00:54:38,036 --> 00:54:38,904
Scott: Cool grandpa would love it.

1160
00:54:39,086 --> 00:54:42,320
Rym: Oh, cool grandpa is the one who will take the kid to it without the mom knowing.

1161
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:45,632
Scott: I could see totally cool grandpa and grandson going to this.

1162
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:46,400
Scott: Totally awesome.

1163
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:46,801
Rym: Yep.

1164
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:47,751
Rym: Grandson's like, "Don't tell your

1165
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:48,236
Rym: mom."

1166
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,059
Rym: Grandpa, not grandson.

1167
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:51,391
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

1168
00:54:51,411 --> 00:54:52,280
Scott: Give him the old wink.

1169
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:55,351
Scott: Oh, the Prairie Bible Fellowship comic with the porn behind the stove.

1170
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,060
Rym: Oh my god.

1171
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:56,975
Scott: That's what it is.

1172
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:07,060
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1173
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,371
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

1174
00:55:12,573 --> 00:55:17,624
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1175
00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:20,552
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one but four different shows.

1176
00:55:20,673 --> 00:55:25,219
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1179
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,220
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
