1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,432
Rym: It's Monday October 30th 2017.

2
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:14,434
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:20,227
Rym: Yeah, and this is a very terrifying episode of GeekNights because we are.

4
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:30,099
Rym: it is the premiere of GeekNights Eve because Halloween is when GeekNights first aired back in.

5
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,259
Rym: Some of you were not even born then.

6
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,999
Scott: And if that's true, are you saying there's 11 year olds listen to eat man.

7
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:41,432
Rym: I am confident there's at least one 11 year old listening.

8
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:42,014
Scott: You're less than 12 years old.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,068
Rym: This probably should not be listening to our show.

10
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:46,515
Scott: This show is not appropriate for you.

11
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:47,137
Scott: Stop listening.

12
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:49,183
Rym: Fuck Fuck fuck.

13
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:52,734
Scott: That's not what makes that's appropriate for all ears and is my opinion.

14
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:54,440
Scott: There are other things that make it not appropriate.

15
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:58,852
Rym: We might be providing wisdom to a child who will then come.

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,795
Rym: school doesn't matter.

17
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:02,863
Scott: That's why yeah Grades don't matter.

18
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:04,709
Scott: unless you want to be a doctor a lawyer some shit.

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,619
Rym: your grades matter in so much as you need to Manage them to game the system to get out of school.

20
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:19,160
Rym: But yeah, we've been already people in this chatter like you're actually gonna talk about batteries this time because we have gone down this road before.

21
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,640
Rym: Yes, we were talking about batteries, but first.

22
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:30,206
Rym: So I got an open event Sure for the 12th anniversary episode of GeekNights because you remember the other day while ago we had a chili party And I made that chili.

23
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:31,960
Rym: that was better than anyone expected.

24
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:34,124
Scott: So a long time ago, right?

25
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:41,287
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, I've been experimenting with chili since and I had an idea and other people I'll enter a chili contest.

26
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:46,448
Rym: No, no, no, no, but I wanted to make a chili Where the base was not onion.

27
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:48,353
Rym: as I typically do I do onion based chilies.

28
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:49,857
Rym: Usually is like my core stock.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,844
Rym: I Use celery.

30
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:52,808
Scott: Okay.

31
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,780
Rym: Let me tell you it was real goddamn good.

32
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,819
Rym: Okay, like real good.

33
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:04,847
Rym: so take any chili recipe and just replace the part where it says onion with a 50/50 split of onion and celery.

34
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:09,929
Rym: if you're not adventurous, but if you're a if you're a maverick, oh all celery You will not be disappointed.

35
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:19,363
Rym: Uh-huh You got you got to add some cumin or something to bring back that sort of tangy oniony character actual flavor I got.

36
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:24,707
Rym: so the other remember when I make a chili the other thing I do is I put like Five cloves of garlic in there.

37
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,733
Rym: Yeah independent of everything else.

38
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:27,415
Rym: Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:31,368
Rym: Also the kidney bean Not that pinto bean kidney bean.

40
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,634
Scott: I'm I'm still black bean.

41
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:35,700
Scott: I like black bean I don't know for a chili black bean.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,689
Rym: But so the recipe I based this on.

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,920
Rym: I did not do because this recipe went a little overboard.

44
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,880
Rym: It wanted the kidney bean the black bean and the pinto bean.

45
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:47,931
Rym: It also wanted both ground beef and ground sausage.

46
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,740
Rym: I want just ground beef and just kidney bean.

47
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:52,566
Rym: But again, I'm experimenting.

48
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,392
Rym: I'm broadening my chili horizons.

49
00:02:54,934 --> 00:03:00,889
Rym: And if you don't think beans belong in Chile I don't know how you found GeekNights or why you're still listening.

50
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:04,456
Scott: Anyway, I went to cafe my so I give you a cafe Maya.

51
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:07,465
Rym: I Miss that kind of Mexican food.

52
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:07,987
Rym: Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,415
Rym: So you got some news on this Monday.

54
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,399
Rym: This is Monday.

55
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,885
Scott: I do have a news.

56
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:13,608
Scott: what the hell was it?

57
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,296
Rym: the surge of sites.

58
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,220
Scott: and oh, yeah.

59
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,190
Scott: So here's the thing, right?

60
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,428
Scott: It's bad enough that when you go to a website That you got all these ads popping up.

61
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:23,493
Scott: Of course, you got ad blocker.

62
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:24,940
Scott: So you're all good, right?

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:33,680
Scott: Yeah, and if you don't have an ad blocker get an ad blocker, yeah and way back in the day, you know There was JavaScript they added to browsers because HTML wasn't enough.

64
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,066
Scott: It wasn't just enough to have a website.

65
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:38,420
Scott: show you something and then have you click links to go to other sites.

66
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,740
Scott: They need to have sites do things that were interactive.

67
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:55,300
Scott: so you needed some way to code and somehow if you can read about the history yourself JavaScript became the language that's in the browser and In the day people use JavaScript pretty much just for evil like make shit blink and annoy the fuck out of you and make pop Ups and do all sorts of evil with it.

68
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,180
Rym: Like most people who were smart the kind of people who blocked ads either just blocked JavaScript.

69
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,024
Scott: Yeah, people just turn JavaScript off because it was only used for evil nonsense And all these.

70
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:08,893
Scott: pretty much everyone was like, oh good web developer.

71
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:10,297
Scott: Don't use any JavaScript.

72
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:10,959
Scott: Just don't use it.

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,270
Scott: Yeah, do not use.

74
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:16,392
Scott: but then over time People just couldn't help themselves and they had to use it.

75
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:32,200
Scott: and there were ways and our ways to use JavaScript for good and just about any website you go to these days is using it many ways for good to make the web experience better right and whatnot, but Over time JavaScript is all still been used for great evil.

76
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:35,850
Scott: And there's one great evil that it is being used for now.

77
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:42,800
Scott: see for the most part that even though JavaScript can do all sorts of stuff It can't really do anything like outside the web page.

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:53,080
Scott: Browsers have these controls in them such that the JavaScript running on a page can only do certain things and if it tries to do Other things the browser will say no, I'm not gonna let you do that.

79
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,196
Rym: Yeah, and unless there is a separate exploit like in the browser or something You're not it's not gonna break out of that box.

80
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:03,577
Rym: right now There are exploits like that, but it's not really what we're talking about here.

81
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:10,699
Scott: now It's like, you know It just so happens that there is one very evil thing that it can totally do within the box.

82
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:16,494
Scott: Because I mean if you visit a website The JavaScript has to be able to get information from the website and send it to you.

83
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:18,682
Scott: and get information from you and send it To the website.

84
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,770
Scott: that's basic obvious functionality.

85
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,720
Scott: You can the JavaScript can communicate with the website you're visiting.

86
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,610
Scott: It's like duh it needs to do that.

87
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:33,720
Scott: Well, someone's like well Let's see what evil can be done with just that seemingly perfectly safe and secure technology.

88
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,715
Rym: Do external I/O and access processing cycles.

89
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:37,640
Rym: That's what I got to work with.

90
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:42,480
Scott: It basically means that well, there's no limits on how much of your CPU it can use.

91
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:43,182
Scott: So

92
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:43,423
Rym: there's a

93
00:05:43,483 --> 00:06:02,219
Scott: lot of websites these days unbeknownst to you that if you visit them without correct blocking and such The JavaScript will completely without you knowing unless you know It wanted to your CPU cycles and notice that when you visit that site your CPUs getting used a whole bunch Start mining some coins and then if any coins get mined by you.

94
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:03,503
Scott: Well, guess what?

95
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,706
Scott: You don't get no coins.

96
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:06,210
Scott: the first website you're visiting.

97
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:13,413
Scott: you're sending all the coins to them whether they be bitcoins or Ethereum's or whatever the fuck coins people using these days doge coins.

98
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:14,095
Scott: I don't fucking know.

99
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,400
Scott: fuck all them coins.

100
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:20,122
Scott: and that on the one hand is Great evil.

101
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:24,240
Scott: you basically stealing my electricity my CPU cycles ruining my computer.

102
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:28,460
Scott: I didn't give you explicit permission for this except maybe in the site's terms of service.

103
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:34,856
Rym: You're being all shady which you know About that because of one of the or one of the group one website that is doing this.

104
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,525
Rym: we have some more info about Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,393
Rym: But anyway go on.

106
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:40,650
Scott: Yeah So on the one hand that's bad, right?

107
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,140
Scott: We don't want that and if anyone's doing that you should block them.

108
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,262
Scott: But on the other hand Right.

109
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:49,480
Scott: It's like I don't believe in these coin nonsense blockchain bullshit, right?

110
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,480
Scott: That's a bunch of get-rich-quick shady scam artists business.

111
00:06:54,464 --> 00:07:02,940
Rym: There are legitimate Interesting uses for blockchain and blockchain like technology, however Cryptocurrencies themselves have fundamental flaws.

112
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:10,985
Scott: Back in the day people would just be running like affiliate scams making websites full of casino ads trying to make money for without doing Work on the internet.

113
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:13,620
Scott: Yeah today those same people are doing coin shit.

114
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:21,385
Scott: Which is it's like this huge amount of people who are just like I need to make money for without doing a lot of work Website.

115
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:35,195
Rym: I did this when I saw when I was in like late middle school early high school There's this thing where you use this special web browser and they would pay you like a penny an hour or so But they'd show you ads constantly while you were using the internet.

116
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:38,954
Scott: No, no, this is see People using that browsers.

117
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:40,100
Scott: I might be able making that bro.

118
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:50,790
Rym: Oh, yeah But I tried to exploit that browser and I ran a bunch of them on different accounts and had a script that would move my mouse a little bit Anyway, but I made like a couple bucks people all.

119
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:56,908
Scott: if there's any way to try to make real money without doing anything Just by having computers do stuff people will get.

120
00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:03,912
Scott: this is class of people that get all over it and those people are currently Keeping the coin business afloat.

121
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:04,595
Scott: That's what they're.

122
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:05,458
Scott: that's what they're doing.

123
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:14,980
Scott: Anyway And if you actually insert real money into that system, you are the mark Yeah, then they are all competing with their computers to take your real money.

124
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:21,840
Rym: Now if you say but I made tons of money on cryptocurrencies Yeah, a lot of people near the top of a pyramid scheme make a lot of money anyway.

125
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:34,740
Scott: but one Possibly good like aspect of this that I hadn't thought of until someone pointed it out is like well We do have this fundamental problem and that people make content put it online.

126
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,455
Scott: Some people are making legit content and they have trouble making money.

127
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:39,840
Scott: They got a deal with bullshit YouTube.

128
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:41,308
Scott: They got to put ads.

129
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,232
Rym: I mean case in point.

130
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:51,419
Rym: the only reason they got a patreon GeekNights is free because we have money To have covered this shit for so many and it's not that expensive true for us.

131
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:52,243
Rym: But that's cuz.

132
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,194
Rym: we can do a lot of the expensive stuff ourselves with our brains.

133
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,596
Rym: Yes.

134
00:08:55,937 --> 00:09:06,038
Scott: Anyway, um What is it what if we live in a world where you go online and there's just no ads and there's no?

135
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:20,700
Scott: but everything's great Because everyone is mining coins while you're consuming their content Like you're watching a video on Netflix and while you watch it You know It's happening and Netflix is just mining you and that's how you're paying and that's in Netflix will cause zero.

136
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:26,860
Rym: Arguably, that is how we pay for a lot of for example, Google services in that they're mining data from us.

137
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Rym: They're not mining bitcoins or whatever, but they're getting data about what we do and that's the actual product.

138
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,864
Rym: That's how we pray Google.

139
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:38,540
Scott: but see but date mining data about you has like all these privacy implications, right?

140
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:49,452
Scott: It actually wouldn't be harmful to you really except your electric bill Which is where you'd end up paying which for them to just use your CPU cycles And then that's how you pay them, which is not nothing.

141
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:51,500
Scott: However, because I'm nothing it's not free.

142
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,274
Scott: It's not actually free but you'd be paying for it in a different way.

143
00:09:55,294 --> 00:10:01,611
Scott: That would actually a It could be good for the environment because you'd you'd be.

144
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:10,575
Rym: we manufacture all these CPUs and a lot of them are going underused Because modern CPUs clock down and don't like they use less power when they're not fully utilized.

145
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:18,998
Scott: Yes, but it would still Manufacturing, you know resources of making the CPUs right the silicon and the factory is polluting, right?

146
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:28,500
Scott: You know Google would end up buying less CPUs for their mainframe, you know They're big data warehouses and whatever because they just be using yours, right?

147
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:30,550
Scott: I'm just saying it's just.

148
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,840
Scott: that's at least a little something.

149
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,760
Rym: So right that is because coin hive is apparently the big one in this.

150
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:36,943
Scott: Yeah I've is me.

151
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:44,220
Scott: coin hive is a company that makes a thing where if you're a website maker or owner You can just get coin hive code and put it on your website.

152
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,129
Scott: Well, and now people visiting your site will mine coins for you And I guess coin hive is getting money.

153
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:55,748
Rym: to quoting this Ars Technica article coin I've presented service as a white way and users can support sites without viewing online ads.

154
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:04,434
Scott: Mm-hmm Consents yes, you don't know that you're doing this.

155
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:05,640
Scott: just how how you visit a website.

156
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:13,606
Scott: they could be showing you ads and using your computer to mine for them and - I Really don't think that Legitimate websites are using this.

157
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:16,576
Rym: I would bet that it's mostly scammy websites that are using this.

158
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:17,880
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's just a guess.

159
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:23,902
Rym: oh, yeah, and malware blockers have already started just blocking coin hive outright saying yeah We don't care.

160
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:27,880
Rym: if you think you have a legitimate business you have a quote unquote legitimate business.

161
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,364
Scott: Oh, yeah, but at least there is.

162
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:54,077
Scott: it's like it's illegitimate because the cryptocurrency stuff is all shady bullshit Right, but the fundamental the lower fundamental idea just on its own taking away the sleaziness of bitcoins and whatnot is Hey pay for things by letting the thing the person that created the content that deserves to be paid in some way Borrow your CPU cycles to use them for me.

163
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:56,586
Scott: But then you're not fucking using them.

164
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:59,214
Rym: they are actually directly charging you that.

165
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:09,100
Rym: the amount of money that electricity costs Which is gonna be more than people will expect it will be more than you expect Will actually be quite reasonable if you consider how much content you consume.

166
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,100
Rym: Ah, but why in directly like that?

167
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:18,151
Scott: If I read a webcomic and I end up paying like ten cents on my fucking electric bill for the time It took me to read the webcomic.

168
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:18,939
Scott: That's a bargain.

169
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:27,132
Rym: Oh, no, so already I'm pretty sure that a lot of these keep running constantly after you visit them Can't have JavaScript running once you close a tab.

170
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:27,735
Rym: I rise.

171
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:28,720
Rym: I was skimming this article.

172
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,047
Rym: I said something about hidden browser window.

173
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,293
Scott: Well, that is shady as fuck.

174
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:34,697
Scott: Yeah, can't be doing that.

175
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:45,099
Scott: But also if Most people only use the internet on their phones Yeah, that's a problem because your phone CPU you'd kill your battery, right?

176
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,568
Scott: And well, it's not a good deal.

177
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:48,280
Scott: a lot of people and some phones.

178
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,820
Rym: It does not make their phone battery running out before they get home might as well be a death sentence.

179
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,944
Scott: Yeah, that's not cool.

180
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:57,579
Scott: Right because there's a battery situation also and there's not much CPU.

181
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,330
Scott: to mine That's a weak-ass CPU even in a high-end phase.

182
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,480
Rym: just kicks a more fundamental problem down the road.

183
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:06,244
Scott: I found X is really fast but it's not as good as even like an i3.

184
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:17,080
Rym: the fundamental problem this kicks down the road is That the social that we lack a social contract for how media should be funded in society.

185
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:25,347
Rym: So the right way to do it now would be for people to pay some token amount directly for their content or to have some other system in place.

186
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:39,888
Rym: the idea of Quietly using a resource people don't understand causing a bill They don't pay attention to to go up by the amount that they would have just paid directly Removes the visibility to those people.

187
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,720
Rym: the fact that there still is a social contract that is funding content.

188
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:49,181
Rym: It hides from them the real cost of content and as long as you hide it from them they will never care about it Right.

189
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:53,000
Scott: I think the way to do this is obviously you have to let the person know that it's happening.

190
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,575
Scott: They can opt in or out and have some other payment method and you know such and such right.

191
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:06,862
Scott: but there is and the other Question is how do you without sleazy coins convert the person CPU cycles into actual money to pay like into my rent if I'm an Artist

192
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:25,949
Rym: also, I would argue that for a lot of P I mean PCs are already not much of a market like that, but between laptops and PCs at least Causing a CPU to clock up and stay clocked up for a while and a computer that is probably not well built or well dusted But it also goes hardware failures and such.

193
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:30,911
Scott: Well, I mean don't have any computer you'll take care of yeah, but again also don't push.

194
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:40,482
Scott: yes, I'm talking about an ethical and Reasonable way of doing this because obviously the only people are doing it right now are doing it evilly and unethically and yeah Fuck them.

195
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:51,780
Scott: I mean, I feel like I'm saying there is a whole a small Hope in this story of evil doing of hey Maybe we can solve this problem somehow by mixing this up and changing in this way.

196
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:54,436
Rym: I feel that direct microtransactions are better.

197
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:59,379
Rym: indirect Microtransactions just reek of abuse and reek of scams.

198
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:05,540
Scott: sure But what if there is an honest way of you know, somehow turning CPU cycles into fair real money.

199
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,443
Scott: That's not bullshit.

200
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:16,106
Scott: and people who say teenagers who don't have money in credit cards can say yes You know, I agree that this thick cut, you know This video site is YouTube video.

201
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:20,400
Scott: I'm watching can borrow some CPU cycles to pay for me watching this video.

202
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:22,408
Scott: I'm not using my computer.

203
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:25,020
Rym: There's an economy if you talk about the environmental cost of that.

204
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:46,404
Rym: There is an economy of scale in Real supercomputers that if you're distributing that load to a wide array of much shittier machines that are maintained to dubious degrees May end up drawing more energy out of the system than the centralized ones would thus having an indirect and negative Environmental impact.

205
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:47,810
Rym: Yeah kind of like how

206
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,975
Scott: but you know, but while

207
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:49,858
Rym: there are efficiency

208
00:15:49,899 --> 00:16:01,068
Scott: losses It's tough to measure the environmental impact because it's like, you know People always talk about like all the environmental impact of driving a shitty car, but it's like versus the cost of Manufacturing an electric car.

209
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,940
Scott: Yeah, it's like you're better off using the used car that spewing out, you know gas.

210
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,819
Rym: Well, that's the whole conversation of electric cars.

211
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,502
Rym: They have more.

212
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:14,686
Scott: so it's like alright is running this CPU for and making some heat right and using some Electricity that the CPU already exists.

213
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:19,240
Scott: How does that compare to making a new CPU at the fab, right?

214
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:25,012
Scott: I don't know the numbers on this But I'm just saying there's a potential there at least to investigate maybe as good maybe as bad.

215
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,055
Rym: Yeah, I'm just.

216
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:30,109
Rym: I am so Highly dubious of all of that.

217
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,614
Rym: I'm also increasingly dubious of the.

218
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:35,690
Scott: I mean, yes right now I'm just talking about potential features right now.

219
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,156
Scott: Fuck anyone who does this.

220
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:46,291
Scott: block them all And also fuck your coins, yeah There's a reason I don't have any fucking coins and hands off my CPU.

221
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,475
Scott: That's the story today.

222
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,020
Scott: That is the story today.

223
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:50,058
Scott: No buts about it.

224
00:16:50,240 --> 00:17:04,760
Rym: So in a much shorter news because I don't want to get too much into the specifics of Portugal But it appears that at least one Portuguese ISP is Doing the exact thing that all the nerds were warning would happen if net neutrality is not protected by governments.

225
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:10,136
Rym: They're literally selling packages of oh, you want to watch YouTube videos.

226
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:16,527
Rym: That's another five currency units a month, ah, you want to watch YouTube videos and Netflix videos.

227
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:24,140
Scott: Well, you got to get the premium package So you got to pay your ISP and then you got to pay Netflix our YouTube or whoever also because they're not giving out.

228
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,775
Rym: Yeah, and I don't want to get into the details.

229
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:32,940
Scott: this article The actually the thing that we were worried they would do is try to charge Netflix, but they're not doing that.

230
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:40,725
Scott: They're just charging the customer saying oh you pay for us as ISP You're paying your ISP bill then you pay Netflix themselves But then you got to pay us.

231
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,480
Scott: if you want to add Netflix to your is piece you getting doubled booked.

232
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:55,077
Rym: Yep, now the real problem with this is that shift is moving from fighting against an entity that has resources to fight back on an Equal level because Netflix can say go fuck yourself.

233
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:59,460
Rym: Mm-hmm Some random dude in Portugal does not have the power.

234
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,940
Scott: I don't know if Portugal has the local monopolies on the internet a service provider.

235
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,466
Rym: That's why I don't want to get into the details.

236
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:10,213
Rym: not because I have some higher motive because I don't fucking know anything about Portuguese ISPs.

237
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:18,357
Scott: no But like in the United States at least if someone were to do this like say I have Time Warner I don't really have much of a choice of anyone to switch to right.

238
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,139
Scott: It's like that's the only one that's connected to my building.

239
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:25,557
Scott: So I can get I guess shitty DSL from Verizon over the phone line.

240
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:26,260
Scott: fuck that noise.

241
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,218
Rym: But the higher-level problem and this is why net neutrality is so important.

242
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:29,560
Rym: and why?

243
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:36,872
Rym: You as a nerd who's listening to the Monday episode of GeekNights Which I assume is the least popular episode of GeekNights.

244
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:37,293
Scott: I don't know.

245
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,578
Scott: It's the hardest episode to do.

246
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:55,979
Rym: Yep But when we care the least about the reason normal people need to care about net neutrality Is that the only reason the cool shit that happens on the internet is happening is because the pipes are neutral So anyone can try to sell a cool service or thing.

247
00:18:56,403 --> 00:19:05,458
Rym: Netflix could not have begun Without net neutrality because Netflix needed to assume the pipes are there and get to everyone to then try to offer a service on top of those pipes.

248
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,993
Rym: It's a series of tubes and we need to protect that.

249
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:10,520
Rym: everyone has access to those tubes.

250
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,188
Scott: This is a common business model.

251
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:20,120
Scott: actually even forgetting the internet just in Technology and other businesses also in general is you make something new and you got to compete.

252
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,319
Scott: You gotta they got to compete with something that's entrenched or you're new to market and you're brand new.

253
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:33,334
Scott: But what you do is you make your product open and relatively free for everyone and it gains Popularity and then once you're big enough you lock that shit down and everyone's locked in.

254
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:35,380
Rym: but locking down the internet locks down.

255
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:43,652
Scott: We had this open internet and all these companies were able to use it to get real big Amazon Google Facebook Twitter everyone and now Netflix.

256
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:51,610
Scott: it's like oh well now we're big, you know Let's lock it down and now we'll stay the Kings forever because you know We already got on top of the hill and it's very telling.

257
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,344
Scott: let anyone new in the same gate that we use to get up To the top.

258
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:56,080
Rym: there is an opposite direction.

259
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:12,180
Rym: This could go in that the big companies that have already succeeded in the previously neutral environment if they were evil They would actually be against net neutrality Because a loss of net neutrality locks new competition out of ever competing with them at least in internet businesses.

260
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:26,908
Rym: yeah, so the fact that even the big a like a Moral giant internet companies are also against very very against it because the ISPs will have power over them because of the monopolies ISPs have.

261
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:38,799
Scott: if ISPs didn't have a monopoly the Google's of the world would love to get rid of net neutrality And I think ISPs should be basically destroyed and regulated like power companies are.

262
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,573
Rym: yes They should be utilities providing a service.

263
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,934
Rym: That is a Ostensible right to all citizens and at a reasonable and highly regulated price.

264
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:47,837
Rym: and SLA.

265
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:48,238
Rym: Mm-hmm.

266
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:49,700
Rym: But yeah.

267
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:58,400
Rym: So the this is one more example you can use to terrify your muggle friends about why they should at least Occasionally call their senator and say the words net neutrality.

268
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:06,652
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

269
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,540
Rym: Scott's got a Monday relevant thing of the day.

270
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,000
Rym: So I will go first with my much less inspiring not Monday related thing of the day at all.

271
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:18,420
Scott: So obviously I got to start by saying that I admit I do not have a lot of knowledge on this topic.

272
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:21,234
Scott: I only know what you learn about DNA in like high school.

273
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:24,699
Scott: I Only remember most of it and not all of it.

274
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:25,844
Rym: I took more.

275
00:21:25,904 --> 00:21:34,400
Scott: something about the helix splits apart and then the RNA comes along and copies and makes the other half and they got Two DNAs right something like that and this ACGT and they match up.

276
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,140
Scott: Yeah, and there's some like polymerase enzyme and some other one.

277
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,717
Rym: I'm just saying proper nouns and linking them to those are definitely the right proper nouns.

278
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:43,380
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

279
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,159
Rym: Do you remember what the nucleotides are?

280
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,568
Scott: Yeah, ACG and teeth.

281
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:55,650
Rym: so ending guanine cytosine Yeah, I mean, yeah, you know, which one is not in RNA?

282
00:21:57,142 --> 00:21:58,628
Rym: No, it's replaced by uracil.

283
00:21:58,648 --> 00:21:59,793
Rym: I I've heard it.

284
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:05,756
Rym: so whatever the point is I just said bounced off of the near bottom of what I remember about biology rice.

285
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:25,058
Scott: Anyway, here is video of video right video of real-time DNA replication like you see these like lines going across its DNA growing in real time Like you're watching this shit happen Like photons are bouncing off the DNA and hitting this microscope camera.

286
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:27,426
Scott: I presume Right and you're watching it go.

287
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:28,270
Scott: It's like holy shit.

288
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,909
Scott: And what they learned from this video is that Shit is not like they thought it was.

289
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,280
Scott: it has something to do with like how the strands coordinate.

290
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:43,840
Scott: I don't completely understand it But basically a lot of stuff that they thought and taught you in high school or college or ever is not a hundred percent, right?

291
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,567
Rym: So I took AP bio in 1998 and also it just I mean fuck.

292
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:54,140
Scott: whatever the information is that I understand and probably won't matter to me anytime soon.

293
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,249
Scott: But holy shit, it's a video of DNA replicating.

294
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:00,017
Scott: They predicted something they couldn't see and then they saw it.

295
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:01,080
Scott: That's so science.

296
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:06,824
Rym: I still have my AP bio textbook from 1998 and It's half wrong now.

297
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:09,414
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz I watch SciShow so I get a lot of like.

298
00:23:09,474 --> 00:23:10,920
Rym: here's a current thing about science.

299
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:19,640
Rym: Holy shit, have we discovered a lot about cellular biology since 1998?

300
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:27,220
Rym: Holy shit has a lot changed To the point that I Highly dubious that I know anything about how cells work anymore.

301
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:29,980
Scott: No, but if you want to see DNA with your eyeballs check out my thing a day.

302
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:30,422
Scott: That's pretty.

303
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,410
Scott: you know about biology and DNA.

304
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:32,972
Scott: I'm sorry.

305
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,317
Scott: I don't know as much as you do.

306
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:39,160
Scott: Don't hate me I'm admitting that I don't know and I'm wrong and you'll still love this fucking video.

307
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:48,575
Rym: So if you are much lower brow and that and that thing of the day terrifies you I just got some YouTube live streamer guy but the lowest brow.

308
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:53,032
Rym: so I Stumbled upon this channel in this video just kind of randomly.

309
00:23:53,052 --> 00:23:57,284
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it was legit Really funny.

310
00:23:57,304 --> 00:24:01,120
Rym: and it wasn't just me because I played it again for Emily and it was legit funny.

311
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:04,960
Rym: And then I played it for a bunch of other people and it's legit funny.

312
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:12,413
Rym: And then I figured some stuff out about this, dude This dude has been this kind of crap since the early Newgrounds days.

313
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,720
Rym: Okay, so he's like he's in our clade.

314
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,508
Rym: He's more old-school like he was making.

315
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:19,803
Rym: you know, those like fuck his head like those nonsense videos We used to watch.

316
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:20,043
Rym: Mm-hmm.

317
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,171
Rym: This dude was doing that stuff back then.

318
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:23,776
Scott: and is who is the dude?

319
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:24,298
Scott: What's his name?

320
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,266
Rym: Uh, Video game donkey.

321
00:24:26,286 --> 00:24:27,211
Scott: Okay.

322
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,100
Scott: Is he like a gamer gate or a bad person?

323
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,335
Rym: No, he seems like a perfectly fine person with a vaguely Brooklyn accent.

324
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,962
Scott: Oh, that's my kind You're.

325
00:24:33,983 --> 00:24:34,626
Rym: you'll hear some.

326
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,414
Rym: some hints of.

327
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:40,920
Scott: you can't hold 10 Pokemon But those are Jersey kids if I'm not mistaken.

328
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:43,916
Rym: Yeah, but see I can't tell those accents apart.

329
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:44,640
Rym: a group in the Midwest.

330
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:53,602
Rym: But this video is just a collection of stuff things that happened in Breath of the Wild and One.

331
00:24:53,623 --> 00:25:00,999
Rym: if you haven't really explored the crazy nonsense You can pull off in Breath of the Wild like making airships or bringing chickens with you.

332
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:14,099
Rym: It gives you a lot of ideas of crazy crap you can do in this game because the game lets you do a lot of crazy crap like What if you knock the weapon out of a bokoblin's hands and give him a Korok leaf and he tries to kill you with it?

333
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:17,854
Rym: Is it even possible for him to hurt you with that Korok leaf?

334
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:19,280
Rym: And the answer is pretty funny.

335
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:28,505
Rym: So this video is pretty good and I guarantee you will laugh at least once during it and it's only like six minutes long And then at a moment.

336
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:30,936
Rym: the book club book was the fifth season by N.K.

337
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:31,278
Rym: Jemisin.

338
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:31,660
Rym: We did it.

339
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,164
Rym: We done it.

340
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:33,092
Rym: We did a show on it.

341
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:33,999
Rym: You can listen to it.

342
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,332
Scott: Oh, you didn't choose a new book club book during that episode.

343
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,240
Rym: I did not and I will choose it very soon.

344
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,664
Scott: It's not the Count of Monte Cristo.

345
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:47,239
Rym: Now, the Count of Monte Cristo is held out solely as a punishment if I ever get displeased by your book club choice.

346
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:50,540
Scott: Meanwhile, you seem to like my book club choices better than yours.

347
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:53,128
Rym: I think my book club choice has been pretty good, too.

348
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:53,550
Scott: Uh-huh.

349
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:55,959
Scott: Let's have a poll whose book club choices are better.

350
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,047
Rym: We finally got the archive with book club books.

351
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:01,620
Scott: Also, I'm pretty sure the last book club book you chose was a stolen choice from me.

352
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:02,804
Rym: Let's see.

353
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:03,469
Rym: Let's see.

354
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:04,395
Rym: We did the Prince of Nothing.

355
00:26:04,415 --> 00:26:08,775
Rym: That was both of us Uh Snow Crash Earthsea.

356
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,666
Rym: Then I picked a Fair World Arms.

357
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:11,890
Rym: You did Cavalier and Clay.

358
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,893
Rym: I did Steppenwolf.

359
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:16,541
Rym: You did Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mm-hmm.

360
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:20,131
Rym: I did Locke Lamora, and I think I skipped one.

361
00:26:20,252 --> 00:26:20,733
Rym: I can't tell.

362
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:23,622
Rym: I don't remember who picked what in these old episodes Uh-huh.

363
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:25,792
Rym: I picked the Ear of the Eye and the Arm.

364
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:26,375
Scott: Okay.

365
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:27,218
Rym: That was really good.

366
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:31,759
Rym: That's okay Yeah, but anyway, I will pick it soon, but I'm already mostly done with the second book.

367
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:34,550
Scott: I gotta get started on that.

368
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:39,359
Rym: Yeah, I know a lot about the moon now and I'm very pleased with some things that I learned.

369
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:43,834
Scott: and The only thing that surprised all those people who smacked down the second book are wrong.

370
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:56,640
Rym: Uh, I can see why they would say the things they said about the second book so far because some Fundamental truths were revealed very directly and I can see why some people would be disappointed by that.

371
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:59,936
Scott: But no, I like that as long as there's another terrible secret of space.

372
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:13,975
Rym: at the same time I was not disappointed by that at all because I Learned to think about the moon and I was a hundred percent right about almost everything I thought about it, but then I learned about the other moon.

373
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:15,160
Rym: That's a very different moon.

374
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:20,306
Rym: Anyway, so I got this Technology control room and it's good shit.

375
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:27,752
Scott: this Saturday October 4th and also 5th is Gamer X East, G-A-Y-M-E-R-X East.

376
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:34,800
Scott: obviously, even though this is a convention That is mostly for L-G-B-Q-T all the letters.

377
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:41,079
Rym: I'll be honest I say all the people just because I don't want to get into the argument of how many more letters all the letters.

378
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,023
Rym: I include Everyone.

379
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:44,416
Rym: L-G-B-T dot star everybody, right?

380
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,503
Scott: It's meh, but you can come even if you're like us just a cishet boring white dude who sucks Still go.

381
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:57,420
Scott: I guess if you're a homophobe you might not want to go but I mean you're still probably welcome there.

382
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:01,819
Scott: Yeah, especially if you're in New York City and you like games is a good place to go.

383
00:28:02,562 --> 00:28:05,334
Scott: This weekend Saturday and Sunday is gonna be awesome time.

384
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:06,620
Scott: You can get the info on their website.

385
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,720
Rym: Yep, we will be there Saturday most of the day just hanging out playing games.

386
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:15,295
Rym: Yeah, like if you want to play a board game with us, we're just gonna be hanging around this.

387
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:18,243
Scott: Friday and Saturday is Blizzcon.

388
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,216
Scott: if you care about any games that Blizzard makes.

389
00:28:20,518 --> 00:28:24,760
Scott: oh, yeah There's gonna be championships of all those like Hearthstone world championship and such and such.

390
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,139
Scott: Also Saturday and Sunday if you care about netrunner is the netrunner world championship so you can just stream that shit on Twitch.

391
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:35,270
Scott: So, you know, you can watch around.

392
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:46,540
Scott: you can watch if you're not a gamer X. You can switch between the first rounds of the Swiss rounds of Hearthstone and the final rounds of heart Net runs start of netrunner and the end of hearthstone and then on Sunday watch the end of netrunner anyway.

393
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:52,053
Scott: Also on Sunday is the end of daylight savings time in the stupid place.

394
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:54,200
Rym: We live daylight saving time.

395
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:58,987
Rym: There's no s on the end of whatever TP I know about daylight saving time.

396
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:00,632
Scott: Anyway, it's fast fucking bullshit.

397
00:29:00,752 --> 00:29:03,380
Scott: It's gonna be dark at like 5. fuck that nonsense.

398
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:10,340
Scott: Also, that is gonna be the New York City marathon, which we don't give a shit about because you shouldn't run marathons.

399
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:11,687
Rym: Yeah, I run marathons.

400
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:16,791
Scott: I ran one Saturday before the marathon starts There's an opportunity if you have a bicycle to bike.

401
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,096
Scott: Oh bicycle Michael.

402
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:22,614
Scott: I'll bike Michael Yeah on the marathon route before people start running and doing stuff.

403
00:29:22,754 --> 00:29:25,129
Scott: if you want to do that ending on the weather I may do that.

404
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:25,938
Scott: I did it last year.

405
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:29,820
Rym: Yep I did it last year except I bailed at the Queensborough because I didn't want to be trapped in Manhattan.

406
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,914
Scott: I use the Roosevelt Island sky car to get back.

407
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:35,650
Scott: I could also use a subway to get back Yeah, like an F train or something.

408
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:39,849
Rym: So I'll see but a Google, you'll find it's pretty easy to do.

409
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,220
Rym: like you might wonder like oh, well, where do I meet?

410
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:47,520
Rym: Just like look on reddit and head vaguely where the start is and you'll see a bunch of other bikers.

411
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:52,840
Scott: But it's not or it's way down south in Brooklyn close to the Verrazano.

412
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:59,291
Rym: The only thing I'll warn you about because it wasn't we were I wasn't clear on this last year There will still be cars on the route just way less.

413
00:29:59,331 --> 00:29:59,452
Scott: Yeah.

414
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:00,074
Scott: No, it's good.

415
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:01,480
Scott: The roads aren't closed yet.

416
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,531
Scott: That's why you can do this.

417
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,440
Scott: They're partially closed.

418
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:08,720
Scott: They'll be barricades up in some places But now the roads are technically still open because the marathon hasn't started yet.

419
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,112
Scott: But they're all setting marathon shit up and there's not a lot of cars out at y'all.

420
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:17,799
Scott: crackety crack crack as a dawn on Sunday, especially not when there's a marathon going on.

421
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,720
Scott: Yeah, right.

422
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:24,221
Scott: So there's very few cars and you can just bike along the route and so you get to the part that's actually closed near the Finish line.

423
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:24,543
Scott: anyway.

424
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:38,240
Scott: other things the week before Thanksgiving we're talking about November 16 salt 17 18 19 is PAX Unplugged in Pennsylvania which sucks but it's packed some plug which is great.

425
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,044
Rym: We will be there.

426
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:40,190
Rym: we will be enforcing.

427
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,600
Rym: we will be doing a two-hour event Where we're gonna teach a bunch of people how to play Carcassonne.

428
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:56,993
Rym: we're gonna teach them how to be ruthless monsters at Carcassonne and then we're gonna put them all in a Basically pub G equivalent Carcassonne tournament last man standing in a single elimination To see what happens when you make monsters and make them fight each other.

429
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:58,600
Scott: tomorrow is Halloween.

430
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:11,501
Scott: Good, you're probably listening to this on Halloween the 12th anniversary of GeekNights and in the beginning of January It's gonna be magfest on the 4th 5th 6th and 7th and then PAX South on the 12 13 14.

431
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:13,329
Rym: Oh my god, it's gonna go boom packs.

432
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:16,702
Scott: It's gonna go magfest packs out 1 2 1 2.

433
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:21,715
Rym: Also, if you've been wondering why a lot of our side content hasn't been bustling so much.

434
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:25,210
Rym: It's because of all these conventions I've had to organize and deal with our panels.

435
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:26,558
Scott: for all this shit's going down.

436
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:32,115
Rym: meeting into January stuff will really calm down and all our side projects will probably pick up.

437
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:33,859
Scott: you can't do any of these events.

438
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,306
Scott: you Should still follow us everywhere on the internet.

439
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:37,650
Scott: We got two youtubes.

440
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,613
Scott: We got twitches.

441
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,097
Scott: We got twitters.

442
00:31:40,137 --> 00:31:40,980
Scott: We got Facebook's.

443
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,803
Scott: We got instagrams.

444
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:45,295
Scott: We got everything that people have on the internet all those evil places.

445
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:46,560
Rym: We even got a g-plus.

446
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:51,600
Scott: Yeah, go to all those places and follow us and you can follow along with all this shit.

447
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
Scott: That's going down and I'm like streaming Mario Odyssey.

448
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:59,539
Scott: Okay, all kinds of contents that you can see there because you're not gonna see any content anywhere else.

449
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,681
Rym: So yeah Batteries.

450
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:05,213
Scott: so how many times have you tried to do a battery show?

451
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:06,499
Rym: so only one.

452
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,858
Rym: well So I don't think we've ever done it before.

453
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:10,704
Rym: I Looked I couldn't find it.

454
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:21,520
Scott: I feel like we tried to do a battery show way back in 2000 beacon days and It might have either been lost or was part of another show and probably called the battery show.

455
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,520
Rym: There are some early old episodes of GeekNights where we literally like blew a load and reviewed like five great board games in one show.

456
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,000
Rym: So we're gonna probably redo a lot of those in the future.

457
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:39,659
Rym: But when it comes to this stuff there are Two episodes of GeekNights ever that were lost to time because I don't remember what they were about.

458
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,082
Rym: neither Do I. so there are two shows that we've recorded and then either my computer crashed or I fucked Anytime.

459
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:49,920
Scott: Rym has a show idea that I felt like we did already, but I can't find in the archive.

460
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:53,080
Scott: I either believe he deleted it or is one of those shows they got lost.

461
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,723
Rym: You know that's like.

462
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:57,060
Rym: that's like how I'm still spending that money from when we won in Atlantic City, right?

463
00:32:57,283 --> 00:33:06,960
Scott: Batteries are one of those shows And we tried to do a battery show when recently and we failed for some reason we came up with a better idea at the last Second, okay, but the stream still said batteries.

464
00:33:07,081 --> 00:33:11,403
Rym: So all of you were coming into the stream being like I thought this is batteries WTF All right.

465
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:14,800
Scott: So the other thing is that I actually don't know that much about batteries.

466
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:17,213
Scott: I don't know how good a show I can do on them.

467
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:21,260
Rym: I Think we can talk one, but there's such an important.

468
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,079
Scott: There's such an important thing for all technologies that it's they're kind of worth doing a show on

469
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:27,763
Rym: Your camera,

470
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:28,325
Scott: okay,

471
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:41,938
Rym: so but also we can talk at a high level in the sense that it's very easy, especially for some of you who are younger to Underestimate how ridiculously important modern batteries have been to almost everything you do.

472
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:49,740
Rym: Mm-hmm because when we were growing up The batteries that you are used to today that you just plug into a USB and they just kind of work did not exist.

473
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,497
Scott: right when I was a kid and it wasn't because I only had kids toys to put batteries in it's cuz.

474
00:33:54,537 --> 00:34:00,980
Scott: no literally those are Batteries you could get even like adults of boomboxes had a bunch of fucking D and C batteries to my keyboard.

475
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:02,943
Rym: I had a keyboard like that I would play on.

476
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:07,480
Rym: it took eight D batteries and those bet that lasted like a day.

477
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:11,580
Scott: Yeah Rechargeable batteries were didn't show up till later in my life.

478
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,179
Scott: Childhood like middle and high school in high school is when he had Rayovac renewal batteries and they were garbage.

479
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:20,760
Rym: They were garbage power a game gear for like 10 minutes.

480
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:31,277
Scott: I used them in our TI 80 calculators, right and I would keep we constantly be recharging them Like every teacher had multiple Rayovac rechargers and was constantly charging all the bad.

481
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:35,161
Rym: high school They were like if you use rechargeable batteries, you're on your fucking own I know right.

482
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:42,056
Scott: it was like they gave everyone real bad little batteries and then he could buy Double-a batteries in class.

483
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:44,126
Rym: Oh, wow We're like a dollar each ever.

484
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:47,940
Scott: they gave everyone one full set when they bought their calculator if you bought it from the school.

485
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:52,777
Rym: But I bought my calculator at the store the store as did I because the store was like $40 cheaper.

486
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,353
Scott: And I got it and I got an 86 instead of 83 like everyone else.

487
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,700
Rym: Yeah, everyone got an 83 but because I came in from another school district I went online.

488
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:01,800
Rym: I was yet alive.

489
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:10,226
Rym: I got the 85 because it was superior in literally every six is even more superior in so in many aspects anyway But its memory was actually slower.

490
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:12,011
Scott: Anyway, it was we had more of it.

491
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:13,636
Rym: It did have a lot more of it.

492
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:23,470
Scott: Anyway, so The point is I got the rate the same rechargeable batteries that everyone else had because that was convenient and then I bought even more Of them and during high school.

493
00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:28,078
Scott: I used those exclusively until I got to RIT and I didn't use the calculator anymore really.

494
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:38,898
Rym: but Batteries like buying batteries putting them in devices and replacing them was a huge part Like of the like daily use of basic technology.

495
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:45,260
Scott: Yeah They did not have devices that you plugged in and charged themselves with their built-in rechargeable batteries.

496
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,429
Scott: That was very rare.

497
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,558
Scott: Very very rare.

498
00:35:49,140 --> 00:36:07,035
Scott: Rechargeable batteries period were rare and it was only you know Later on like when laptops were actually some of the first things that like had their own cells Attached to them that you could like swap out and such yep, and that was like the first thing that was using like lithium-ion batteries as laptops.

499
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:14,077
Scott: and then you started seeing like iPods were actually one of the earliest things that charged themselves up right and that was you know, early 2000s.

500
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:15,069
Rym: Yep.

501
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:18,271
Rym: So all those batteries that are not rechargeable.

502
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:19,074
Scott: people were actually like.

503
00:36:19,114 --> 00:36:23,653
Scott: I remember in the earliest days of iPods People were like why the fuck does this iPod not?

504
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,100
Scott: let me like swap out the battery.

505
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:26,865
Scott: Yeah Bones were also.

506
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:34,130
Scott: the earliest flip phones were some of the things that had their own batteries And you could swap those out on the earliest phones now.

507
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:41,480
Rym: part of that was the expectation that up until that point The idea of an embedded battery was not a thing to most people.

508
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,271
Scott: So you assume people would be upset by it.

509
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:49,191
Scott: people want to be able to swap out the batteries All right, because any other battery technology was so shitty.

510
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:51,380
Scott: it would die and take a long time to recharge.

511
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:54,114
Rym: Yep, and also batteries especially back then.

512
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,760
Scott: and if the battery died You didn't want to have your whole expensive electronic device be dead.

513
00:36:58,121 --> 00:36:59,947
Scott: You wanted to just swap out the battery and be good to go.

514
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,817
Rym: and the kinds of rechargeable batteries back then.

515
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:08,371
Rym: and we're not gonna get into the difference between like Nycad batteries which were in early because we don't know.

516
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,583
Rym: I know a little but it's not relevant Mm-hmm.

517
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:17,160
Rym: I part of the reason I do a little was that I was really into like tape mixing and mixtapes and nonsense.

518
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,733
Rym: So I had a lot of portable cassette audio devices.

519
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:22,876
Scott: all mine took double-a's.

520
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:24,119
Scott: even my dis man had double-a's.

521
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:24,556
Rym: Yep.

522
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:32,273
Rym: So I actually started getting different kinds of rechargeables for those because they had a physical motor that had to turn Actually needed a lot of power.

523
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,560
Scott: Yeah, that's one of the other things.

524
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,500
Scott: I was using my ray of X and was that dis man?

525
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:50,551
Rym: Yep But I think one thing well that I remember this very specific moment in my life because as a kid got a game gear And I didn't know a lot about batteries obviously But the game gear took six double-a's and that would last like three or four hours.

526
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:56,107
Scott: Maybe yeah Gameboy GBA Gameboy color They all took double-a's.

527
00:37:56,147 --> 00:37:59,298
Scott: the DS was the one that you would first one that had its own battery.

528
00:37:59,358 --> 00:37:59,920
Scott: That was different.

529
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,906
Scott: You could swap it though.

530
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:01,388
Scott: I did.

531
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:08,320
Scott: I did swap the battery in my original DS But I think you can even swap the DS light battery and maybe even the 3ds better.

532
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:11,231
Scott: I don't know about that But those are the ones where you started to charge itself.

533
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:14,204
Scott: GBA took two double-a's and as a kid I don't know the SP.

534
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:16,210
Scott: I think you charge the yeah.

535
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,417
Scott: Yeah, you didn't have two double-a's.

536
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:19,180
Scott: the GBA you did.

537
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,223
Rym: I never had an SP's.

538
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:20,926
Rym: I don't really remember.

539
00:38:20,946 --> 00:38:21,648
Scott: I have one now.

540
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:32,415
Rym: Yeah in the in the drawer somewhere, but so My parents being a kid who didn't have any money They took issue with the fact that I ran these batteries out.

541
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:35,840
Rym: every time we drove anywhere I basically went through six double-a batteries.

542
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:43,240
Rym: Yeah, so they want they searched and they found you could buy this like I think it was official this rechargeable battery kit.

543
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,397
Scott: Oh, yeah, a lot of people had that what it was even bigger.

544
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:49,700
Rym: it looked I was about to say it looks like a phone receiver like a phone.

545
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,494
Scott: It was like two big wings coming off the side of the game.

546
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:54,359
Rym: No, no the side one That's not what I had.

547
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,620
Rym: I had this one that looked like the receiver on a telephone which is also as I went across the middle.

548
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:00,928
Rym: Yeah, it hung from the bottom of the game gear.

549
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,200
Rym: it weighed as much as the game gear by itself.

550
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:10,660
Rym: It took like eight hours to charge it if I plugged it in and it powered the game gear for like three hours.

551
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,800
Scott: Couldn't you just plug into the lighter on the in the car to keep your game gear going the whole time?

552
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,279
Scott: I know lots of my friends did with it.

553
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:22,236
Rym: Yeah So here is the problem the the actual device to plug that to plug into the game gear.

554
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:26,020
Rym: cuz remember devices back then Didn't have a standard power input.

555
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:32,960
Scott: No It had a interface that basically Mimicked the shape of all the six double-a batteries and went right in there and pretended to be bad.

556
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:34,505
Rym: There was an AC adapter.

557
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:36,071
Rym: Okay for the game gear.

558
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:37,235
Rym: I think the Gameboy had one too.

559
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:38,198
Rym: Oh, yeah, there was.

560
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:41,600
Rym: yeah When I was playing at home, I just plugged in with the AC adapter.

561
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:54,767
Rym: But the thing that cut the AC adapter plugs into the wall and or into the car Cigarette lighter which is extra funny because that interface stuck around even though that is not used as a cigarette lighter By anyone.

562
00:39:54,787 --> 00:40:00,700
Rym: it hasn't been for a long time Yeah, but and it was just a convenient source of powers like a hack back in the day.

563
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,669
Scott: These cars these days have USB in them a lot Yeah But they usually still have the old cigarette lighter port.

564
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:10,314
Rym: because I'm gonna say some of them do but some because there's so many devices That use that socket.

565
00:40:10,395 --> 00:40:10,557
Rym: Mm-hmm.

566
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:31,620
Rym: But the plug that you plugged into your device because your device took AC or took DC usually The only devices that are AC were like even older devices that were just motors basically Would have a proprietary connector That would not plug in anything else and took a particular voltage and had particular parameters.

567
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:42,478
Rym: So as a result, you usually had to buy either a first-party car adapter That was often not cheap or you had to buy a bootleg one which before Amazon kind of hard to do.

568
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:50,840
Scott: actually Yeah, imagine with no internet, you know e-commerce trying to buy like a Gameboy car adapter thing.

569
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,624
Scott: It's like you.

570
00:40:51,644 --> 00:40:54,900
Scott: better hope the one toy store has them somehow in stock.

571
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,579
Scott: Yeah, I mean you're getting a first party order from a Nintendo catalog and hope you actually get it.

572
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:00,724
Scott: Who knows what.

573
00:41:00,904 --> 00:41:02,029
Rym: and thus the problem.

574
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:03,435
Rym: I had the game gear.

575
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:04,520
Rym: my brother had the game boy.

576
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,227
Rym: Which one of us gets to plug into the car?

577
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:09,220
Scott: right anyway, so more battery stuff, right?

578
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,899
Scott: So that eventually right phones iPods laptops.

579
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:15,400
Scott: That's when the rechargeable battery started to really be in everything.

580
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:24,650
Scott: Lithium-ion battery was invented and you finally had enough power density a good recharge time That obviously improved over time and also a battery life cycle.

581
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:33,580
Rym: previous rechargeable batteries the more you cycled them And there's details as to what kind of cycling damaged them the most they wear out they get less and less.

582
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:42,129
Scott: Yeah, those rail vac ones I was using the TI calculator you recharge and recharge and recharge and recharge them and then eventually they'd last like 10 minutes and Throw them out even though they're rechargeables.

583
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:43,596
Scott: you can recharge them forever.

584
00:41:43,616 --> 00:41:44,540
Scott: a lithium-ion.

585
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,220
Scott: You can recharge a ton of time and thus this is why ever but a ton of time.

586
00:41:49,280 --> 00:42:01,654
Rym: This is why modern devices have an embedded usually not replaceable battery Mm-hmm because that way they get whatever that whatever the battery is You shouldn't care if it's lithium-ion or some other kind.

587
00:42:02,196 --> 00:42:03,779
Rym: you shouldn't care What?

588
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:10,924
Rym: Particular method of cycling it or how much ambient power to leave in it if it's not used for a long amount of time and Shoot you deep cycle.

589
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:15,000
Rym: that is wizard nonsense that no one should need to deal with in the modern era.

590
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:22,920
Rym: So there is a circuit where the device knows how to manage its own battery to maximize its usability and longevity.

591
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:24,540
Scott: You would hope you would hope so, right?

592
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:25,441
Scott: It's like, you know I plug.

593
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:33,552
Scott: I pretty much believe things plugged in even if they're 100% like a whole all the time and I trust that those devices Are smart enough to manage their own batteries intelligently.

594
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:34,696
Rym: and kids in the old days.

595
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:38,128
Rym: That was not true No, and the only rechargeable devices that game gear thing.

596
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:42,120
Rym: It said when the light turns green fucking unplug it or it might catch fire.

597
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:58,221
Scott: Yeah, and it's like they're all sorts of like, okay, if you want the laptop even like think pads They'd be like, all right You know the all the always you would have spread rumors around like if you want your ThinkPad battery last the longest you got To let it drain down to 30% then charge it back up to 100 and then let go down to 30.

598
00:42:58,221 --> 00:43:06,360
Scott: Don't leave it plugged in when it's 100 and then once every few months Let it go down to zero and then all the way down to zero like a hundred percent dead and charge it up again.

599
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,585
Scott: It's like what the hell.

600
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:08,127
Scott: why do I got?

601
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:12,826
Scott: shouldn't I just want to plug it in all the time whenever I can and only Unplug it when I have to?

602
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:17,728
Scott: so I use you know minimal battery power Yeah, and I want everything to be good now.

603
00:43:17,748 --> 00:43:21,501
Rym: So in my current laptop now, it's just Windows 10 Like.

604
00:43:21,722 --> 00:43:25,277
Rym: I wiped all the stuff but when I first got it, it had some like IBM stuff on it.

605
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:39,535
Rym: The battery management software that came with it actually exposed all those details and you basically would choose Whether you wanted the battery to last longer in any given use like how long will the laptop run?

606
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:41,200
Rym: and you could make it?

607
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,236
Rym: Run a lot longer, but then the battery itself would have a shorter lifetime before it just stopped working.

608
00:43:47,477 --> 00:43:53,740
Rym: Mm-hmm and Most devices favor the battery lasting as long as the device is expected to last.

609
00:43:54,585 --> 00:44:10,080
Scott: So during college for a short period of time I had a job working somewhere and one of the things that they made one of the things that they made there Was military like military batteries like batteries that military people actually use like they had a big charger on the back of their Humvee or whatever.

610
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,393
Scott: And if these enormous friggin batteries used to power who knows what?

611
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:16,500
Scott: or I guess I don't know power suits or whatever.

612
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,740
Scott: And you know, they made like the recharging software and some of the hardware for these batteries.

613
00:44:23,023 --> 00:44:23,931
Scott: So they had them around.

614
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:27,520
Scott: I wasn't working on them But my friend James did and I think he still works on batteries.

615
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:28,264
Scott: I guess he.

616
00:44:28,284 --> 00:44:31,320
Scott: well you can't be on the show to tell us all his battery knowledge.

617
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,096
Scott: He's probably so mad if he listens to this at our lack of battery knowledge.

618
00:44:35,357 --> 00:44:38,530
Rym: I remember You and him from RIT.

619
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:44,740
Scott: those batteries were big Heavy and they lasted a long time and gave a lot of power.

620
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:46,586
Rym: So everything we just talked about.

621
00:44:46,606 --> 00:44:51,299
Rym: there's a fundamental thing that you really need to know and this is why this is kind of an interesting topic.

622
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:57,160
Rym: The better a battery is The more energy it holds per unit mass.

623
00:44:57,501 --> 00:45:03,480
Rym: Yeah, the more energy it holds for unit mass the more closely it resembles a hand grenade, right?

624
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,736
Rym: I mean because there's more energy in a smaller space right thing about.

625
00:45:06,756 --> 00:45:15,137
Scott: it's like, okay No matter what battery technology it is chemicals or solid-state or who know whatever it is Whatever mechanism you have for holding energy, right?

626
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,216
Scott: Electrons don't weigh nothing.

627
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,204
Scott: We don't weigh nothing.

628
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:24,860
Scott: well and if protons weigh even more right and so this you gotta have the protons any electrons in there.

629
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:32,135
Scott: Uh, and if you want a battery lasts a long time Right, you got to have you know, a lot more energy in there.

630
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:33,720
Scott: energy is mass.

631
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:34,459
Rym: I'm shit.

632
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:53,699
Rym: I make no statement as to everything you just said and I'm going to simplify that to simply say that the more energy density something has the more catastrophic a Rapid uncontrolled release of that energy would be case in point You take that old shitty battery pack for my game gear and shove out an iron spike through it.

633
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:55,339
Rym: It'll probably go play.

634
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:03,262
Rym: Well, look at how many people shove an iron spike through like just a raw modern lithium-ion cell full energy and it'll kill you All right.

635
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:05,520
Scott: Look how many people I got my got my cell phone exploded.

636
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:11,245
Scott: It's like yeah, cuz you have a battery and there were the insane amount of energy in it And they actually can.

637
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:23,344
Scott: there is technology out there to make some kinds of batteries that are better in terms of you know Energy than the ones we have but you're not allowed to use them or they won't like people won't mail them and stuff because it's like Well, they're super dangerous.

638
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:26,573
Scott: There's a lot of energy in a space or they have other trade-offs.

639
00:46:26,593 --> 00:46:32,540
Rym: They're very expensive manufacture very heavy They take a long time to recharge or a lot of them act more like primary cell.

640
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:42,000
Rym: Like if you have a battery that is not intended to be rechargeable There are ways to make very long-lasting batteries, but then they run out Yeah, and then you gotta get another one and give you an extreme.

641
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:43,611
Scott: Oh, they don't go nicely into.

642
00:46:43,672 --> 00:46:47,497
Rym: inside of an iPhone case There is actually the concept of a nuclear battery.

643
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:56,760
Rym: now These are not commonly used except in space and like old Soviet era like remote unmanned lighthouses.

644
00:46:57,362 --> 00:47:07,000
Scott: But a nuclear battery is a battery that weighs more than you can imagine, but it's relatively small Because it's got you know radioactive elements which tend to have really high numbers and are thus heavy.

645
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,632
Rym: But it also needs shielding because it's radioactive.

646
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:12,558
Scott: Yes is led in the radioactivity is.

647
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:18,440
Rym: Well, basically, usually they're actually just generating ambient heat which is then some sort of Peltier device.

648
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:24,735
Rym: there's a lot of ways to get a nuclear battery, but They these are a battery that if you had one it'll output.

649
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:31,987
Rym: however many volts it outputs You know how much energy it you it provides for like 20 years Depends on the half-life, but yeah fucking long-ass time.

650
00:47:32,027 --> 00:47:43,559
Rym: You have a battery that will last consistently 20 years of constant use Mm-hmm, but if you break that battery open It'll kill you and a lot of other people nearby.

651
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,556
Rym: They'll get the cancer and it'll also way too much to put in.

652
00:47:46,596 --> 00:47:56,295
Scott: say a car Yeah You're not putting even like even it was like a flake imagine like a cornflake worth of radioactive material Right and then putting a whole battery around that and somehow getting that in your phone.

653
00:47:56,315 --> 00:47:59,629
Rym: It's like no Regulators might have a big issue with.

654
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,759
Scott: but even half a cornflake is too much.

655
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:02,923
Rym: So think of these.

656
00:48:03,003 --> 00:48:08,660
Rym: this is the the boundaries of the idea of a battery and a portable energy or semi portable energy repository.

657
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:13,376
Rym: You can go from a nuclear battery that lasts forever to a tiny flake that will kill anyone.

658
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:27,890
Rym: It looks at it crosswise Mm-hmm, and it's just a matter of use cases material science Chemical science and it's a field that needs to evolve further to do the kinds of things We want to do with technology that we can't do today.

659
00:48:28,192 --> 00:48:29,820
Rym: the Tesla like those electric cars.

660
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:34,020
Rym: It is amazing that there are batteries that can hold that much power.

661
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:35,024
Scott: Well, there's a also.

662
00:48:35,044 --> 00:48:39,080
Scott: you just use a lot of batteries and it somehow manages to not be too heavy.

663
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,340
Rym: So the motor can actually push the car, but there is a huge number of batteries in there.

664
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,959
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's like a whole tray of them, right?

665
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:52,751
Rym: But when you we already you're already breaking down the I how many cells comprise a battery Doesn't really matter to a modern person.

666
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:54,500
Rym: No, I'm working in the technology.

667
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:57,273
Scott: Yeah, you don't realize it but like okay you open up your iPhone is it?

668
00:48:57,293 --> 00:48:58,840
Scott: there's like a rectangle battery in there.

669
00:48:59,463 --> 00:49:01,050
Scott: The battery is not a rectangle shape.

670
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,376
Scott: batteries are cylinder shaped.

671
00:49:02,396 --> 00:49:04,620
Scott: if you open that up There's a ton of little cylinders in there.

672
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,119
Scott: You don't care how many or whether they're in series or rows or anything, but that's that's how it is.

673
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:10,448
Rym: So not all of them are.

674
00:49:10,468 --> 00:49:11,900
Rym: there are other shapes of batteries.

675
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:23,150
Rym: But the point is unless you work on the internals of batteries specifically the beauty of the modern world is that there is circuitry and electronics Intelligence between you and all that bullshit.

676
00:49:23,532 --> 00:49:29,440
Scott: Yeah, so you don't need to know what's actually going on But yeah, most batteries are actually a whole bunch of smaller batteries combined.

677
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:31,509
Scott: Yep, right because it's like it's cheaper.

678
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:42,170
Scott: right you can instead of making some custom battery You can just buy these stock cells and just arrange them to get the voltage you need and the life you need Right and then encase them in something and put a connector on the end.

679
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:44,960
Rym: So in terms of practical example, it's kind of interesting.

680
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,487
Rym: Remember I bought that weird phone.

681
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:49,480
Rym: like everyone else has a normal Android phone or an iPhone.

682
00:49:49,562 --> 00:49:50,340
Scott: Are you the Sony thing?

683
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,540
Rym: I have the weird Sony thing and the real deal with the Sony thing is the battery lasts twice as long as any other phone.

684
00:49:54,641 --> 00:50:01,678
Scott: Well, cuz it's not as powerful as the other phones Like the Samsung galaxies are like ridiculous CPU ridiculous screen ridiculous GPU.

685
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:05,146
Scott: Oh my gosh Yours is much more reasonable like iPhone 5c.

686
00:50:05,187 --> 00:50:09,820
Rym: the batteries we put in phones all pretty much have the same energy density.

687
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:18,178
Rym: So the only factors in terms of how long your cell phone's battery last can last How big it is how heavy it is and how much your phone uses.

688
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:30,474
Rym: Yep And thus there's an interesting situation where a larger phone will have a much larger screen that has to be lit very brightly But can also have a much larger battery in it.

689
00:50:30,715 --> 00:50:30,856
Scott: Yeah.

690
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:31,900
Scott: Well, you need it to accommodate.

691
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:39,962
Rym: My tiny phone actually does not have a lot of room for battery But at the same time it also has a much smaller screen with many fewer pixels and a slower processor Right.

692
00:50:40,043 --> 00:50:46,300
Scott: So the other thing is that when you if you're thinking about saving battery life on your phone Keep the screen off the screen uses the most energy.

693
00:50:46,481 --> 00:50:55,460
Rym: That is why we talk so much about how smartwatches are so great because if you have a smartwatch You're not gonna turn your phone screen on as much you'll be shocked at how much longer your phone's batteries last.

694
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,633
Scott: Yeah, because the Bluetooth uses a Bluetooth is very low energy depending there.

695
00:50:59,674 --> 00:51:01,058
Rym: They well, it should be.

696
00:51:01,098 --> 00:51:04,246
Scott: there's also Specifically NFC and Bluetooth.

697
00:51:04,286 --> 00:51:11,734
Scott: low energy is actually a protocol that exists is different from Bluetooth and if you use Bluetooth low energy It's way less energy than turning on your screen.

698
00:51:11,975 --> 00:51:15,490
Rym: Yep, way less So in terms of practical battery stuff.

699
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:19,666
Rym: modern laptops, you don't need to worry anymore Like I think Lenovo.

700
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:24,020
Rym: you can still buy like you pick which got the batteries just like they do.

701
00:51:24,562 --> 00:51:26,528
Scott: They do sell as far as I know.

702
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:31,706
Scott: like you can buy a bigger battery pack because I bought what they're like six cell And nine cell ones you can.

703
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:34,494
Scott: you can buy a battery that was bigger heavier and lasted longer.

704
00:51:34,514 --> 00:51:38,646
Rym: Yeah, my x230 I bought the Six cell one.

705
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,500
Rym: there was a four cell I think and I forget you bought the new one.

706
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:44,079
Rym: Yeah, I didn't buy the biggest one because it was really big.

707
00:51:44,482 --> 00:51:47,420
Scott: Oh, I had a normal one and I had one that was big and stuck out the back a little bit.

708
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:55,451
Rym: Yep So the one I bought sticks down a little bit and the bigger one Sticks down more and also sticks back and weighs so much.

709
00:51:55,471 --> 00:51:56,374
Rym: like I went lifted one.

710
00:51:56,394 --> 00:51:57,698
Rym: I didn't get that one.

711
00:51:57,718 --> 00:51:58,260
Rym: It was too much.

712
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:02,135
Rym: but Where was I going with that?

713
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:08,120
Rym: Alright modern laptops unless it's one of those weird laptops like it like it just has a battery.

714
00:52:08,282 --> 00:52:09,998
Rym: Just use your laptop and don't think about it.

715
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:10,421
Scott: now.

716
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:20,560
Scott: the one last thing you I think about here is for a lot of things and this is I've encountered this a lot with cameras is People companies want to sell you their specific battery, right?

717
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,705
Scott: So you look at my camera.

718
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:24,600
Scott: is Panasonic Panasonic sells a battery for it.

719
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,896
Scott: That battery costs a lot of money like 70 bucks or like a tiny like 40 to 60 bucks.

720
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:36,480
Scott: Alright now they're nice in that they've what they've done, you know Some of the companies do nice things and not nice things, right?

721
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,293
Scott: One of the nice things they did is the gh3 the gh4 and the gh5.

722
00:52:40,594 --> 00:52:44,409
Scott: if you keep using their camera system They all use the exact same battery.

723
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:46,860
Scott: They haven't changed the battery at all, right?

724
00:52:47,763 --> 00:52:49,580
Scott: So you can you know, they've had the same battery.

725
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,760
Scott: They've been made and it's good for them too because they just keep manufacturing the same battery.

726
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,520
Scott: You don't have to redesign it or anything, right and it's got enough power.

727
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,100
Scott: It lasts a hell of a long time longer than a lot of batteries and other cameras.

728
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:05,380
Scott: But anyway, the thing is that battery is expensive like 40 to 60 bucks depending on where you get it if you get an official one.

729
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,870
Scott: So maybe you want to get a cheaper one.

730
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,320
Scott: plenty of other people make the same exact battery.

731
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,448
Scott: It's just not the official battery.

732
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:14,175
Scott: It's made by like wasabi Co.

733
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:21,060
Scott: which is somewhat legit Yeah, but it's not obviously not official or even shady your bootleg one that says pass anonic on it.

734
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:29,000
Rym: Yeah, I bought a variety of non first-party batteries over the years with a wide array of effects.

735
00:53:29,322 --> 00:53:32,160
Scott: Sometimes you buy a third-party battery, right?

736
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:40,180
Scott: And that third-party battery lasts five seconds or explodes or sets on fire or is useless or who knows what or?

737
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,920
Scott: Some some devices these days even have like DRM and are like, ah, I see that that is not an official battery.

738
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:50,956
Scott: I refuse to turn on even though I would otherwise be able to work because I want.

739
00:53:51,117 --> 00:53:53,752
Scott: I want you to buy the $50 battery, but it's interesting.

740
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,820
Rym: my old Panasonic camcorder.

741
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:58,942
Rym: I have two official batteries and I have like six bootleg batteries I got from.

742
00:53:59,784 --> 00:54:01,951
Rym: I get them from anyway somewhere.

743
00:54:02,252 --> 00:54:12,020
Rym: the bootleg batteries all worked at first just fine But then over time one by one they stopped working and the camcorder would be like this is not an official battery.

744
00:54:12,494 --> 00:54:16,833
Rym: Yeah I've had but I didn't have any firmware update and I figured out what actually was happening.

745
00:54:17,113 --> 00:54:21,709
Rym: is those batteries the bootleg ones were just pieces Of shit and their voltage was fluctuating too much.

746
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:22,030
Scott: Yeah.

747
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:31,091
Scott: Now the wasabi batteries I have are actually, you know they're so cheap compared to the the official ones and Occasionally very occasionally you'll get a message.

748
00:54:31,131 --> 00:54:35,139
Scott: That's like I see that battery is not legit But then you just restart the camera and it works.

749
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,920
Scott: Yep, and it's like it's like that small hassle is worth it, right?

750
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:46,280
Scott: You're only gonna pay if you are so important Whatever you're shooting with your whatever your door your whatever device you're using camera or otherwise.

751
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:50,260
Scott: If it's so important that it works perfectly then pay for the official battery.

752
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:59,938
Scott: If you absolutely cannot deal with an exploding battery and you're so nervous by the make sure you're getting the official one and not a bootleg that looks like the official one or really on Amazon.

753
00:55:00,238 --> 00:55:06,200
Rym: if you Cannot afford to have something go tragically wrong with an expensive piece of electronics that you saved up for.

754
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,838
Rym: Don't if you bought a thousand dollar camera, don't try to save 40 bucks on a battery, right?

755
00:55:11,878 --> 00:55:16,557
Scott: It's like, okay I understand that you don't have a lot of money and you saved a long time for this thousand dollar camera.

756
00:55:16,577 --> 00:55:23,400
Scott: because you don't have a lot of money Save even more money for the good battery because if the thousand dollar camera goes down you're going down.

757
00:55:23,561 --> 00:55:24,668
Rym: I'm like this LED panel.

758
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,318
Rym: I got here that I paid like 20 bucks for.

759
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:36,469
Rym: I Bought a bunch of cheapo bootleg batteries for those things because if these LED pay if every LED panel I own broke today because the batteries exploded.

760
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:40,040
Rym: I'm not out that much money because I don't buy good light panels.

761
00:55:40,221 --> 00:55:48,852
Scott: So the new camera I got came with a legit battery and what actually I've been doing is I've been treating it like That battery is actually an internal non-removable battery.

762
00:55:48,872 --> 00:55:59,440
Scott: I just plugged the camera into micro USB at night Right, but I did buy two wasabi batteries for it, which were ridiculously cheap and they work just fine perfectly.

763
00:55:59,862 --> 00:56:07,800
Scott: So that if I'm ever in a situation where I'm out so long that the battery dies I can swap those bad boys in right because and they just they totally were great.

764
00:56:08,141 --> 00:56:09,206
Scott: It was like wasabi.

765
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:09,910
Scott: is this brand?

766
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,412
Scott: and I'm not.

767
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:10,693
Scott: I'm not.

768
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:13,078
Scott: I guess I am shilling for them But they didn't pay me for this.

769
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:18,295
Scott: I've honestly just like a happy customer of a bootleg battery that you can buy.

770
00:56:18,315 --> 00:56:23,194
Scott: an Amazon that I've had good Experiences with doesn't works almost all the time.

771
00:56:23,274 --> 00:56:24,600
Scott: I've had a lot of recharges.

772
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,113
Rym: I've had good and bad with wasabi, but I've never had exploded bad.

773
00:56:28,173 --> 00:56:30,120
Rym: I've only had it just doesn't work anymore.

774
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,586
Scott: But I've never had doesn't work anymore.

775
00:56:31,606 --> 00:56:32,750
Rym: Like oh my god works.

776
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,220
Rym: They're sitting right there cuz I just haven't dealt with them yet.

777
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:39,515
Scott: All right, but they always give you a charger and they're so cheap Like you don't even feel bad if they don't work.

778
00:56:39,555 --> 00:56:44,945
Rym: as well as the yeah Charges I've had a couple of their chargers that make Terrifying noises sometimes.

779
00:56:45,065 --> 00:56:48,797
Rym: I haven't had that either but then again some of my light panels make terrifying noises.

780
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:53,840
Scott: cuz they're yes Yes, I've had those yeah Anyway, but yeah, it's a little shaky.

781
00:56:54,001 --> 00:57:02,840
Scott: Like you hear stories about battery setting on fire and stuff and those are real stories, you know Cuz there's so much energy in the little battery and if it's not well made its bootleg, you know.

782
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,825
Scott: Then they could happen.

783
00:57:03,845 --> 00:57:06,278
Scott: and official batteries, you know that you get from the.

784
00:57:06,419 --> 00:57:11,840
Scott: you know Full price for they're gonna be more expensive But they're gonna be work and they're gonna have a much better chance of being safe.

785
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:14,451
Scott: Not a guarantee of being safe, but pretty rare.

786
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:20,880
Scott: It's gonna be unsafe, but Even if you have money, it's just not worth it to buy the official batteries.

787
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:26,600
Scott: You can get pretty good third-party ones that are good enough now regardless of whether or not as a first party.

788
00:57:27,163 --> 00:57:40,180
Rym: You should definitely treat your batteries with respect In the sense that old kinds of batteries even rechargeable ones They really wouldn't do anything too bad if you disrespected them or were careless with them.

789
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:47,214
Rym: Mm-hmm, but like if I drop a lithium-ion cell like a big one not the tiny ones But like the ones that are on the back of my camera.

790
00:57:47,234 --> 00:57:53,452
Rym: if I drop one one I don't Immediately retrieve it just to make sure it didn't have a problem.

791
00:57:53,814 --> 00:57:58,680
Rym: Like I give it a few seconds like okay It didn't explode and then just inspect your batteries.

792
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,087
Rym: Like if you if something happens to one of your battery if it's inflating a little bit if it inflates even a little bit Like take it outside.

793
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:06,040
Scott: I have some GoPro batteries didn't play a little bit.

794
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:12,980
Rym: Yeah If that happens just get them out of your house as soon as possible and put them somewhere Where if they start a fire, it won't burn anything.

795
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:20,040
Rym: Mm-hmm, cuz that is sign number one that a modern rechargeable battery might be about to catch fire and hurt you very badly.

796
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:28,100
Rym: Oh, yeah, if your phone starts to expand a little bit That means the foil that the cells are in is expanding and you are fucked.

797
00:58:29,004 --> 00:58:30,791
Rym: Take the phone out of your pocket and put it outside.

798
00:58:30,932 --> 00:58:39,923
Rym: Yeah, um if you get them wet Especially dropping them though because dropping them especially a big battery can very often cause a problem More.

799
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:46,369
Scott: this is why the GoPro batteries had the problem because you know GoPro the action camera It's getting jostled quite a bit.

800
00:58:47,032 --> 00:58:47,473
Scott: Yep.

801
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:48,899
Scott: Yeah, have a careful.

802
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:52,830
Scott: There's one more thing I want to say.

803
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,239
Rym: do you remember what it was?

804
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,231
Scott: Oh, yeah, so a lot of people out there like in my work.

805
00:58:57,272 --> 00:59:02,590
Scott: I have this problem a lot of People not recharging the batteries properly, right?

806
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:07,968
Scott: So when you get a battery as rechargeable, you know It's designed to go with a particular charger.

807
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:11,140
Scott: the people who made the charger designed it with a particular battery in mind.

808
00:59:11,702 --> 00:59:14,491
Scott: You can't just go putting like eneloop's in the energizer charger.

809
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:16,658
Scott: No, also people at my work.

810
00:59:16,698 --> 00:59:17,260
Scott: They so dumb.

811
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:22,569
Scott: They're taking batteries that aren't even rechargeable and just like shoving them in a charger It's like what the hell are you doing?

812
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,339
Scott: That's battery's not even rechargeable.

813
00:59:24,781 --> 00:59:26,448
Rym: So the worst part is there are.

814
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:28,718
Rym: I remember when I was a kid there were cut.

815
00:59:28,738 --> 00:59:34,932
Rym: you could buy Things that ostensibly would recharge a non rechargeable battery.

816
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:38,100
Rym: knew those things were bad fucking news.

817
00:59:40,303 --> 00:59:40,966
Rym: So what I did?

818
00:59:40,986 --> 00:59:43,355
Scott: luckily the eneloop charger is smart enough to like.

819
00:59:43,396 --> 00:59:47,160
Scott: not mess around but yeah Recharge batteries in the charger that came with it.

820
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,364
Scott: I'll even have like.

821
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:53,080
Scott: I have wasabi batteries and official batteries and then I have a wasabi charger and an official charge.

822
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:53,911
Rym: I don't mix the two.

823
00:59:53,972 --> 00:59:54,560
Scott: I don't mix them.

824
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:05,420
Scott: I use the wasabi charger and the wasabi batteries and the regular batteries and the regular charger and I don't cross them because you know The charger was designed to recharge that battery and you don't want to confuse it.

825
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:10,680
Rym: I have occasionally put the bootleg battery in the real charger because the chargers what has the logic?

826
01:00:10,921 --> 01:00:14,580
Scott: I would I usually I might do that, but I will go the other way.

827
01:00:14,801 --> 01:00:18,176
Rym: I will never put a legit battery in this like cheap plastic wasabi.

828
01:00:18,196 --> 01:00:20,826
Scott: That's even scarier Yeah, but I don't.

829
01:00:20,886 --> 01:00:21,851
Scott: I try not to do either.

830
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,519
Scott: but yes one is better than the other.

831
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:28,217
Rym: Yeah If you have to so for my own personal batteries because remember we could.

832
01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:28,780
Rym: there's sort of two.

833
01:00:29,081 --> 01:00:31,708
Rym: There's three types of batteries kind of the thing we can end on.

834
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:35,499
Rym: there's portable power bank that has USB holes in it.

835
01:00:36,242 --> 01:00:40,060
Rym: Mmm, I think everyone should own at least one small one because you can recharge your cell phone.

836
01:00:40,342 --> 01:00:42,232
Scott: I have I have one that's like the energy.

837
01:00:42,253 --> 01:00:43,540
Rym: It's nothing so ancient.

838
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:47,615
Scott: It's so ancient, but it has plenty of energy can recharge my phone several times.

839
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:48,860
Scott: It can recharge lots of stuff.

840
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:51,266
Scott: It has enough cables.

841
01:00:51,346 --> 01:00:54,820
Scott: It can recharge almost any device ever has plugs for everything.

842
01:00:55,661 --> 01:00:56,444
Scott: It's not USB.

843
01:00:56,545 --> 01:00:57,690
Rym: my little anchors cuz one.

844
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:00,080
Rym: my anchor just has a couple of USB holes in it.

845
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,365
Scott: Yes I have a tiny anchor.

846
01:01:01,405 --> 01:01:02,389
Scott: There's like a little cylinder.

847
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:03,554
Scott: That's one USB.

848
01:01:03,695 --> 01:01:04,940
Scott: It'll try my phone up once.

849
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:06,970
Scott: It'll charge my phone up like two or three times.

850
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:07,954
Rym: Oh, you got the bigger one.

851
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:09,120
Scott: No, I got a free one.

852
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,120
Scott: They sent me for being a good customer.

853
01:01:11,786 --> 01:01:13,399
Scott: I just keep it in my bag at all times.

854
01:01:13,721 --> 01:01:17,960
Scott: Yeah, and if my phone I can always bring it out if I ever need a phone charge and it's rare.

855
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:18,903
Scott: But it I have it.

856
01:01:18,963 --> 01:01:19,666
Rym: so I have that too.

857
01:01:19,766 --> 01:01:23,900
Rym: I also have a big one that will recharge an iPhone like four times.

858
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:39,093
Rym: but I only use that for like plugging devices into or Powering my phone if I'm doing GPS tracking over like a really long hike in the wilderness Or like I brought that on the Holland Valley Railroad as my power in the tent.

859
01:01:39,635 --> 01:01:39,795
Scott: Mmm.

860
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:41,520
Rym: So that's a use case.

861
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:44,753
Rym: So just you should own one of those if you don't know which one to get.

862
01:01:44,793 --> 01:01:47,629
Rym: just buy like whatever the cheapest anchor branded One is they're fine.

863
01:01:47,649 --> 01:02:05,779
Rym: Uh There's the specialized batteries Which is what we've been mostly talking about just now like the ones you use on an expensive camera or an LED panel And we've talked of that enough for Batteries that are the shape of a double or triple-a battery to use with any old device Which I feel like is increasingly an obsolete use case.

864
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:10,396
Rym: I mean the only devices I have that use those today are 9 volt batteries.

865
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:12,085
Rym: go to my smoke detectors Mm-hmm.

866
01:02:12,247 --> 01:02:13,679
Rym: Fuck that that is such a pain in the ass.

867
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:15,508
Scott: I have a whole bunch of 9 volt.

868
01:02:15,548 --> 01:02:19,241
Rym: The only other thing 9 volt batteries seem to be used for is Microphones.

869
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:30,800
Rym: more wireless microphone devices also non wireless but true pretty much any microphone that needs a battery seems to use 9 But increasingly people seem to be moving toward double-a in there because 9 volt is just an annoying form factor.

870
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:35,859
Scott: I got a 9 volt in the microphone that goes on top of my camera and I bought a whole pack of them from Amazon basics

871
01:02:36,104 --> 01:02:36,613
Rym: yep, and

872
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,542
Scott: Back

873
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:37,943
Rym: of them - I

874
01:02:38,224 --> 01:02:43,764
Scott: accidentally left the microphone on overnight and I've used it a whole bunch and I used it like all day At the fucking review.

875
01:02:43,784 --> 01:02:45,673
Scott: con like, you know, it's like and you know what?

876
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,240
Scott: It's still on the first 9 volt.

877
01:02:47,554 --> 01:02:57,569
Rym: Yep I bought a pack of those same 9 volt batteries because all the smoke detectors in our apartment when the 9 volt bed They're powered by real power They have wires But they also have a 9 volt battery.

878
01:02:57,629 --> 01:02:59,899
Rym: as the backups of the powers out the smoke detector still works.

879
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:11,900
Rym: if a smoke detectors battery fails, it'll make it a really high-pitched annoying chirp at Really short intervals forever and there's no way to stop that short of replacing that 9 volt battery.

880
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:23,639
Rym: Let me tell you when that starts happening at 3 in the morning and you do not have another 9 volt battery Welcome to hell Especially when the rabbits hear it and they you cannot explain to them.

881
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:33,973
Rym: So I basically use antelopes now and the inter only Sanyo Panasonic antelope is the best.

882
01:03:34,415 --> 01:03:37,349
Scott: double a triple a CD rechargeable battery.

883
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:39,440
Rym: if you need C's or D's the fuck is wrong with you.

884
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:43,640
Scott: What they do if you need C or D is actually these plastic cylinders.

885
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:49,540
Scott: And you put your double-a antelopes into the plastic cylinder and now your double-a fits into the C or D hole.

886
01:03:51,044 --> 01:03:52,849
Scott: They don't actually make C and D batteries.

887
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,716
Rym: I kept the D hole like the shapes.

888
01:03:55,977 --> 01:03:57,160
Scott: I kept them but I've never used them.

889
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,180
Rym: I got rid of the C's cuz I don't own anything that could take a C bad.

890
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,667
Scott: You never know when you'll find something.

891
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:03,290
Scott: It doesn't.

892
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,878
Rym: what about a single a or a B?

893
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:13,923
Scott: Actually the stylus that comes with the Microsoft Surface Pro that I have at work what has a Quadruple?

894
01:04:14,104 --> 01:04:14,625
Scott: a bad.

895
01:04:14,786 --> 01:04:16,171
Rym: I've seen those around.

896
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,476
Scott: I've never seen one before in my life.

897
01:04:17,516 --> 01:04:18,620
Scott: I was like, what the fuck is this?

898
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,758
Scott: Where the hell do I get another one when this dies?

899
01:04:22,061 --> 01:04:24,930
Scott: You don't recharge it like you do with the Apple magic pencil.

900
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:27,277
Scott: You had to buy a new battery for it Wow.

901
01:04:27,718 --> 01:04:38,420
Rym: Yeah But With antelope, there's the normal ones, but they actually have two Weird use cases and three different antelopes, but and there's different generations of antelope.

902
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:44,320
Scott: But it's hard to tell the difference between the generations and as far as the users concerned the difference in the generations doesn't really matter.

903
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:46,734
Rym: But there's normal ones and normally we'll use those.

904
01:04:46,794 --> 01:04:47,780
Rym: Yeah, I want to point out noise.

905
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:48,342
Scott: You're curious.

906
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:54,080
Scott: if you don't if you don't know better just take the normal white and loops if you somehow really know what you're doing.

907
01:04:54,401 --> 01:05:01,580
Scott: They have the el cheapo antelopes, which are light don't last as long but are way cheaper and they're way lighter.

908
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,205
Rym: Yes, they weigh a lot less.

909
01:05:03,446 --> 01:05:11,696
Rym: So this is where you like you're putting a camera on a drone and like every ounce counts Yeah, or you know that the device you're putting the batteries.

910
01:05:11,736 --> 01:05:12,800
Scott: It doesn't need a lot of energy.

911
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:18,964
Scott: It's a really low drain device like a portable radio or something and you want it to be lighter and you know Save some money or whatever.

912
01:05:18,984 --> 01:05:23,060
Scott: You can get the cheapo antelopes that are light and I guess more efficient and whatever.

913
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:28,155
Rym: There's also an aloo pros and I have eight a double-a and aloo Pro cells.

914
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:30,000
Rym: They cost way more than a regular one.

915
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,065
Scott: Yeah, they're way heavier.

916
01:05:31,085 --> 01:05:31,808
Scott: Yeah,

917
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:45,760
Rym: like if you hold a regular one and one of these like it is Interesting how much heavier the the pro one is and also I didn't measure this to be sure They're a little bit bigger like they're skirting the line of actually being a double-a

918
01:05:46,202 --> 01:05:50,544
Scott: Big as a double-a as you can fit into a thing if it's one of those Battery holder mine

919
01:05:50,565 --> 01:05:54,620
Rym: are scraped to fucking hell because they barely fit in the Marantz.

920
01:05:55,423 --> 01:05:57,431
Rym: Like I have to shove them into the Marantz.

921
01:05:57,592 --> 01:06:04,120
Scott: I mean while the regular and loop slides in just fine I use the eneloop pros mostly for not for gaming controllers for those uses regular and loop.

922
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,320
Rym: Yep, I love those for a camera flashes.

923
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,420
Rym: I use the pros for camera flash and I use the pros for the Marantz audio recorders.

924
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,633
Rym: We have hmm, which I have three of them.

925
01:06:13,714 --> 01:06:14,740
Rym: I found another cheap one.

926
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,198
Scott: I use them for things that Can only be double-a.

927
01:06:18,801 --> 01:06:20,546
Scott: Yeah, I absolutely need them to.

928
01:06:20,766 --> 01:06:25,700
Scott: I need to like be guaranteed that they're not gonna like turn off right like a recording device.

929
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:30,233
Rym: But even then these are not like pay for these expensive batteries and your thing lasts twice as long.

930
01:06:30,273 --> 01:06:33,466
Rym: it lasts like 10 to 20% Longer, yeah, it's not.

931
01:06:33,506 --> 01:06:35,840
Scott: they're not that much better than the regular ones.

932
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:41,380
Scott: But you only get them if you really have a situation where you must have the more power.

933
01:06:41,821 --> 01:06:42,543
Scott: It's a high-powered.

934
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:44,228
Scott: but what I would recommend now?

935
01:06:44,308 --> 01:06:47,196
Rym: this might have changed and so you can double-check.

936
01:06:47,256 --> 01:07:00,669
Rym: but I bought several of the eneloop pro Charger because the old regular eneloop charger had a thing where you had to put two batteries in at a time Minimum and it would charge them in groups of two.

937
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:01,110
Rym: Mm-hmm.

938
01:07:01,552 --> 01:07:03,740
Rym: The pro one charges every cell individually.

939
01:07:03,901 --> 01:07:08,500
Scott: Yeah, as far as I can tell all it was just an upgrade of the charger model.

940
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:15,011
Scott: Yep, so like even if you go today to buy white eneloop and it comes with the white charger It's the same actual model as the charger.

941
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:18,979
Scott: The clearly charge your pro battery - I don't know They're all it's the exact same model number.

942
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,740
Scott: It's just if you buy the white one of the black one that the plastic is white or black.

943
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:25,129
Scott: But it's actually the same exact charger.

944
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,660
Scott: There's a okay old one is actually a different model.

945
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,606
Scott: It's way back.

946
01:07:28,626 --> 01:07:30,377
Scott: It's like there's something something 17 or who knows?

947
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:36,940
Rym: I bought the pros actually a long time ago and it's kind of amazing that these cells still work great so many years later.

948
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:40,833
Scott: Yeah, I have not had a single eneloop battery ever.

949
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:43,020
Scott: like not be able to recharge and keep working.

950
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:43,928
Scott: That's how good they are.

951
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:44,331
Scott: Of course.

952
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,179
Scott: I do have a ton of them.

953
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:48,492
Scott: Yeah, I mean I I don't need to buy any more ever because I have so many.

954
01:07:48,713 --> 01:07:49,476
Rym: I have 24 double A's.

955
01:07:50,641 --> 01:07:52,207
Rym: I have eight pro double A's.

956
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:53,814
Rym: I have four triple A's.

957
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,040
Rym: cuz I really don't need those anymore.

958
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:58,475
Scott: I use them pretty much in game controllers and camera flashes.

959
01:07:58,515 --> 01:07:58,756
Rym: Yep.

960
01:07:58,877 --> 01:07:59,580
Scott: That's pretty much it.

961
01:07:59,721 --> 01:08:04,369
Rym: I use them for a little while because my bike has lights on it But now I just use primary cells in my bike lights.

962
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:06,520
Scott: all my bike lights now are USB charged.

963
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:09,151
Scott: No, I still have one bike light that takes double a.

964
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:21,169
Rym: still my take double or triple a. yeah And primary cells are just better for that kind of purpose because there's a lot of primary cells are pretty rugged compared to Rechargeable cells and they will survive things better.

965
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:21,651
Rym: Hmm.

966
01:08:21,971 --> 01:08:22,273
Scott: Whatever.

967
01:08:22,292 --> 01:08:22,755
Scott: All right.

968
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:23,417
Scott: I think we're done.

969
01:08:23,457 --> 01:08:23,858
Scott: I'm hungry.

970
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:24,340
Scott: batteries.

971
