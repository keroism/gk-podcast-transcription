1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,811
Scott: It's Wednesday, July 5th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:15,720
Scott: Tonight, we talk about Master Keaton.

3
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,298
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:29,480
Rym: Well, to make up for the fact that I had to go to work on Monday, they've given me Friday off, which I appreciate the gesture, but I really don't have any reason to take Friday off.

5
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:30,273
Rym: Yeah.

6
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:35,740
Rym: I mean, I guess I could go to ConnectiCon early, but I don't have a hotel room, and I'm sure they're sold out.

7
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:39,160
Scott: Yeah, probably sold out, and who knows what the hotels are like over there.

8
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:41,075
Scott: It's not the greatest hotel area.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,437
Rym: I mean, granted, I could just drive over and then drive back, but...

10
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,259
Scott: And then drive back in the next day?

11
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:47,872
Rym: I'll drive back with you the next day.

12
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:48,560
Rym: It wouldn't be so bad.

13
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:50,040
Scott: Eh, I get it.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,684
Rym: I've done that before.

15
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:53,680
Rym: I considered going to UberCon on two separate days by driving.

16
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,140
Scott: Yeah, I think this next UberCon, we're just gonna stay the whole time.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,420
Rym: Yeah, at least the second one.

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,260
Scott: Yeah, we should probably reserve that.

19
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,759
Rym: Yeah, I'll take care of all that soon.

20
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:03,540
Rym: In the very least, we'll stay the whole time at the second UberCon.

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,459
Scott: Yeah, that's for sure.

22
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:08,060
Rym: But yeah, we actually have some listener feedback.

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,160
Rym: I've noticed we get the most feedback for the most off-handed comments we make.

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,386
Scott: I don't know what's up with that.

25
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:18,720
Scott: Maybe we should only make off-handed stuff, and the main topics of shows, pretty much no one cares about.

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,315
Rym: Yeah, like that one time when I said something like, "Blah, blah, blah, antiperspirant," and people were like, "Well, what's wrong with

27
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:24,960
Rym: antiperspirant?".

28
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:28,759
Rym: In fact, that was on our question and answer show.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,397
Scott: Yeah, it was.

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:37,199
Rym: But also, I'm very pleased with this email, because for the longest time, we never got anyone ever writing in to disagree with us.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,100
Rym: And finally, someone has written in to the show to disagree with us.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,280
Rym: I mean, a few people have done it before.

33
00:01:42,883 --> 00:01:45,480
Scott: Well, my problem is it's not... I wanted a hate mail.

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,051
Scott: Like, "You guys suck, evil

35
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:47,838
Scott: blaaah.".

36
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,440
Scott: But we never got one.

37
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:50,199
Rym: We never get that.

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,160
Scott: This is an intelligent disagreement.

39
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,080
Rym: Yep, and I'll say right now, we're not going over this in detail, because we're going to do a whole show on this in the future.

40
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,880
Rym: So I'm going to greatly paraphrase the email.

41
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:02,840
Rym: And this is from Kyle in Vermont.

42
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:06,235
Rym: "Just wanted to make a couple comments about your speeding ticket and jury

43
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:06,658
Rym: discussion.".

44
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,257
Rym: Let's see, blah blah blah blah blah.

45
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,280
Rym: "Scott stated that he is guilty until proven innocent with traffic tickets.

46
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,540
Rym: This is simply not true.

47
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,155
Rym: You can regress to hearing, police officer, deposition, blah blah

48
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:17,477
Rym: blah."

49
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:22,678
Rym: To which I say, "Yeah, I disagreed with Scott on this too, and you should have heard the argument we had off the air about

50
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:22,759
Rym: it.".

51
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:23,316
Scott: You suck.

52
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:26,700
Rym: I mean, the cop has evidence to prove that you're guilty.

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,280
Scott: I didn't say that you are guilty until proven innocent.

54
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,560
Scott: I said you're effectively guilty until proven innocent.

55
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:38,660
Rym: Well, no, because there was a blank slate, and then the cop presented numerous bits of evidence to show that you did something.

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,880
Scott: Yeah, the problem is, if that evidence is fake, you got nothing.

57
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:44,260
Rym: So you're saying that the evidence was fake?

58
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:45,555
Scott: No, but I'm saying if.

59
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:47,119
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

60
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:49,680
Rym: If someone fakes evidence, you're pretty much screwed no matter what.

61
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:50,759
Rym: It doesn't matter.

62
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,779
Scott: Yeah, but that's my point, is that, you know, whatever.

63
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:55,340
Rym: What would you suggest?

64
00:02:56,503 --> 00:03:08,600
Scott: Uh, see, the real problem I have here, sure, technically you're innocent until proven guilty, but the way I see it, it should be more like, they should have to work extra hard to put me in.

65
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,760
Scott: I shouldn't have to work extra hard to get me out.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,979
Rym: But Scott, he's already, I mean, he's got technology that shows you were speeding, he's got his own assessment of seeing you speed, and he's got his following you for a mile or two, watching you speed and going the same speed as you.

67
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,820
Scott: That's not enough.

68
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:24,740
Rym: Oh, that's plenty.

69
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,440
Scott: That's not enough.

70
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:29,225
Rym: That's plenty by any, I don't care how, like, solipsistic.

71
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:31,100
Rym: the world doesn't exist, your philosophy is.

72
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,019
Rym: That's enough evidence.

73
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,440
Scott: That's not enough evidence.

74
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:38,420
Rym: But yeah, as you can all tell, we disagreed about this point for quite a bit.

75
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,240
Rym: And also, the fact remains that you were in fact speeding.

76
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,400
Scott: I wasn't going 81, that's for sure.

77
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:44,878
Rym: Eh, I don't know, you might be.

78
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,057
Scott: Nah, I don't think so.

79
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:52,000
Rym: And then the last bit I really want to get to is, lastly, your discussion of jury nullification was just plain scary.

80
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,058
Rym: In almost every state, juries are instructed that they must not base their verdict on sympathy, prejudice, etc.

81
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:03,499
Rym: A jury is only supposed to decide the facts, with the exception of serious felonies, where they have input in sentencing as well.

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,379
Rym: Let me tell you what happens when jury nullification is used.

83
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,400
Rym: White people get acquitted in the South.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Rym: Rich people get off serious crimes because they can hire a good lawyer.

85
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,220
Rym: A judge can dismiss a case if it is in the interest of justice.

86
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,959
Rym: The difference is that a judge is accountable for their decision, a jury is not.

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,277
Rym: We spent decades trying to overcome sexism, racism, etc.

88
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:22,760
Rym: in our courts.

89
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,720
Rym: Jury nullification was one of the biggest reasons these problems existed in the first place.

90
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:31,220
Rym: If you're ever on a jury, just decide the facts because you clearly haven't thought this through.

91
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,120
Rym: Love the show, Kyle in Vermont.

92
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:40,240
Scott: Alright, well, on the second point, rich people get off because they can hire a good lawyer, that happens with or without jury nullification.

93
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,899
Scott: So let's just wipe that one away right there.

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,800
Rym: Yeah, now in terms of the white people getting acquitted in the South, I'm very well aware of this issue, and in fact I wrote a paper on it in school.

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:00,759
Rym: And the long story short is that civil rights people and black people, and basically undesirables, were being murdered in the South, and then white juries refused to convict the people who did it.

96
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:09,740
Rym: And I guess my first point is that as a libertarian with a lowercase l, any freedom or any right comes with associated risks.

97
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:19,000
Rym: So, like, the freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, but it comes with the risk of hateful speech, annoying speech, dangerous speech, and you have to accept that risk to have the freedom.

98
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,320
Rym: And free speech can be used for good and for evil.

99
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,920
Rym: With jury nullification, I feel it's the same way.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,300
Rym: Jury nullification can be used to overturn unjust laws.

101
00:05:27,784 --> 00:05:29,639
Rym: It can also be used to do corrupt things.

102
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:40,180
Scott: Yeah, so sticking with the civil rights, let's go to the days of Martin Luther King when they would throw black people in jail for sitting in the front of a bus, or sitting on the stool in a Walgreens.

103
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:48,079
Scott: If someone jury nullified that and let them off the hook for doing something, you know, for drinking at the wrong water fountain, then it would be great!

104
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,959
Scott: You know, and it's always better to see the guilty men go free than the innocents put in jail.

105
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,619
Scott: So, jury nullification really doesn't have people being found guilty so often for doing things that aren't bad.

106
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:06,379
Scott: It's usually people, you know, getting not-guilties for doing bad things.

107
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,879
Scott: So I say let the guilty guys go free.

108
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:21,100
Scott: if it means, as law- you know, it's worth it to let those white people in the South not go to jail if we can also keep the black people from going to jail when they're breaking the evil laws.

109
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:26,016
Rym: Yeah, now I also- I would submit that one, the racism, sexism, etc.

110
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:26,580
Rym: in our courts.

111
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:34,439
Rym: that's a problem of society and they're really, like, not letting people nullify laws is really, at best, a band-aid.

112
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:35,177
Rym: Yeah.

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,560
Rym: Plus, I mean, it's still trivial for a jury to just vote not guilty anyway and just not say they're nullifying.

114
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,577
Scott: That is true.

115
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:50,660
Rym: And second, regardless of what anyone feels about the issue the fact remains that it is perfectly legal to nullify laws.

116
00:06:50,941 --> 00:07:00,900
Rym: There is a wide body of common law precedent dating back to before America was even formed in British common law and there's substantial American common law.

117
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:09,140
Rym: right up until the Constitution, everything was codified whereupon numerous court decisions and all levels have affirmed the right to jury nullification.

118
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:19,600
Rym: And, in fact, the most recent decision I think it was in 2000, I don't remember offhand basically decided that, one, you can't tell jurors about nullification in a trial.

119
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:24,200
Rym: But, if they do nullify you can't overturn their verdict.

120
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:28,800
Rym: The best you can do is investigate and see if it was overturned by nullification.

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,560
Rym: They can also compel jurors who think that another juror is nullifying to report it to the judge.

122
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,899
Rym: But even in that case, there's almost no way short of having a hung jury to stop this.

123
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,400
Scott: There's also evidence-- And a hung jury is, you know, as good as a not guilty.

124
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:51,780
Rym: There's also a lot of evidence from various activist groups showing that a large number of trials in the U.S.

125
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,380
Rym: are ending in hung juries and they believe that this is a result of the spreading of the idea of jury nullification.

126
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:58,199
Scott: Awesome.

127
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:06,200
Rym: In fact, there are a number of organizations that specifically advocate it in the cases of drug laws or anti-sodomy laws and things of that nature.

128
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:07,340
Scott: Yeah, think about that.

129
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,540
Scott: If someone, you know, there is a law like, I mean, what states have these sodomy laws?

130
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,720
Scott: Like, if you're caught having some gay sex you could go to jail, you know, in some places.

131
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:24,160
Scott: And if someone jury nullifies that and lets the gay people out, you know, keeps the gay people from going to prison, that's fantastic.

132
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:27,380
Rym: Now, there's a lot of emails.

133
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,058
Rym: We argue back and forth all while I was at work and I really can't go over all of it without devoting a whole show to it, which, again, I will.

134
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:40,799
Rym: But as the argument went on, basically, it's true that this is all right and it can be done from a legal perspective.

135
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:44,320
Rym: And I agree with all of his arguments because they're very good.

136
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:56,397
Rym: The arguments he makes from this point on are that by nullifying, you are circumventing the democracy that we have in place and that if a law is unjust, it is our duty to vote against that law or vote against the people who passed it.

137
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,519
Scott: Yeah, that's all true.

138
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:07,339
Rym: Now, while I agree with this, and the fact that this is your argument, Kyle, I will note that the current laws allow me to nullify.

139
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:14,279
Rym: So, it is your duty as a citizen to vote against that and get the legislature to pass laws prohibiting me from doing so.

140
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:26,780
Scott: Yep, and the other thing I want to say about this particular argument is that, you know, if a government worked the way it's written on paper and all the ideals of democracy in our country held true, that would be just fine.

141
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,740
Scott: The problem is that democracy really isn't working.

142
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,440
Scott: The gears aren't turning so well.

143
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,440
Scott: In fact, they're turning backwards at this point.

144
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:42,800
Scott: You know, like, people in this country are in favor of net neutrality and against the broadcast flag, yet which one passes committee?

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,958
Scott: Huh, I don't know.

146
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:47,640
Rym: I mean, regarding the net neutrality thing, it is not a disputed fact.

147
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:56,760
Rym: There is no one, no one in this country who is in favor of abolishing net neutrality Except for the telecos.

148
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,840
Rym: Except for, not even just the telecos, only the people in charge of the telecos and the shareholders of the telecos.

149
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,480
Rym: That is, like, less than 1% of the population of this country.

150
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:18,160
Rym: And my final point is that I fully agree with you, Kyle, that in many ways, this does, in fact, circumvent our democracy and the will of the people, and I submit that a lot, I mean, there is democracy and there is justice.

151
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,400
Rym: And sometimes democracy and justice are right in line.

152
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,939
Rym: Sometimes democracy and justice are at odds.

153
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:30,140
Rym: As me, personally, I will always side with justice, even if that means abridging democracy.

154
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:30,904
Scott: Mhm.

155
00:10:31,188 --> 00:10:37,479
Scott: Because the fact is, you know, democracy means in a country full of stupid people that stupid things get done.

156
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:42,579
Scott: And, uh, justice means the right thing gets done, no matter what you think that is.

157
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:55,220
Rym: I would also argue that, in fact, jury nullification is the last bastion of democracy, because jurors, at least currently, cannot be punished or reprimanded in any way for the decisions they make in a jury.

158
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,660
Rym: Thus, no matter what, no matter how bad things get, you can always nullify.

159
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,578
Rym: The people can always say, no matter how many bad laws are passed, we won't stand for this.

160
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,780
Rym: And while that power could be used for bad, I think that in most cases it would not.

161
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:12,340
Rym: Especially nowadays.

162
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,039
Rym: I can't think of many people who would seriously try to nullify murder cases.

163
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,180
Rym: Except maybe one of those he-had-it-coming cases in Texas.

164
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,176
Scott: [laughter]

165
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:39,840
Rym: My main point is just that we really flippantly went over the issue, and I'd like to do a whole episode on it, because jury nullification is an issue that I've put a great deal of thought into for many, many years, and I have a very complex opinion that I think warrants further discussion.

166
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:42,660
Scott: Maybe one day we'll be on juries.

167
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:43,648
Rym: You know what?

168
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,740
Rym: In the current system, it is impossible for me to get on a jury without lying.

169
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,498
Scott: Yeah, probably me too.

170
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:49,720
Scott: Depending on what they ask.

171
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,579
Scott: If they ask really dumb questions, I can maybe-- No, no, remember James Randi?

172
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,659
Scott: Yeah, but the judge knew who he was.

173
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,120
Rym: Yeah, they wouldn't let him on a jury because he was smart.

174
00:11:58,421 --> 00:11:59,680
Rym: That was the only justification.

175
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,476
Scott: Yeah, the judge basically said something like, "Oh, aren't you James

176
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:04,720
Scott: Randi?".

177
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,391
Scott: He's like, "Yes, I

178
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:05,472
Scott: am.".

179
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:24,040
Scott: He's like, and he says to the lawyers, I'm trying to remember, this story's coming from memory, so it's not 100% accurate, but the judge said something to the effect of, "That man there is likely to jury based on only the evidence, and not on your lawyerly

180
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,289
Scott: doublespeak.".

181
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:36,200
Scott: And the lawyers literally just immediately-- The lawyers made kind of grumblies and frowny faces and started to hem and haw a bit, and Randi was like,

182
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,503
Scott: "Yep.".

183
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,420
Scott: And then the judge was like,

184
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,203
Scott: "Oh.".

185
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:54,239
Rym: The other problem I have with juries in general, I'll get off of this topic after this, is that currently there is no incentive other than doing your civic duty to be on a jury, and in fact, for many people, being on a jury hurts you because companies really don't accommodate you.

186
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,270
Rym: I mean, they'll give you time off, but they're not going to pay you.

187
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:00,844
Rym: So a working mother who's called in for jury duty, she can't do it.

188
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:02,380
Rym: If she does, she's screwed.

189
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,160
Rym: But if she doesn't, she gets in trouble.

190
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,049
Rym: I mean, yeah.

191
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:11,027
Rym: We won't talk about this further, but we will in the near future do a Thursday episode on it.

192
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:15,960
Rym: So anyone who has an opinion on jury nullification, get in those forums now and start arguing.

193
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,579
Rym: We will take choice excerpts from all of your arguments in our show.

194
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,379
Rym: And Kyle, I've got your emails, and I'll go over all of your points in the show.

195
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:27,596
Rym: And if we ever get Skype and everything working, maybe we'll try to get you on the show.

196
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:32,340
Rym: Because I will say that the reason the argument was so interesting to me is that Kyle is in fact a prosecutor.

197
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:37,734
Scott: Yup, but I don't think anything he says counts as legal advice, because then he gets in trouble.

198
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:39,369
Rym: Oh, no, no, no.

199
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:45,369
Rym: I just have to say for GeekNights' perspective that nothing we say should ever be construed as legal advice.

200
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:45,895
Scott: Yes.

201
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:46,924
Rym: We are not lawyers.

202
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:47,771
Rym: Not lawyers.

203
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,447
Rym: We are just opinionated assholes.

204
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:52,620
Scott: But if it comes to computers, then you can take our advice.

205
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:56,200
Rym: Well, Penn Jillette, we're the nuts, and we take the nut position.

206
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,680
Scott: Well, actually, on computers, we have the professional position.

207
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,320
Rym: Well, yeah, we can be, you know what?

208
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,466
Scott: About anything else?

209
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:03,992
Scott: Nut position.

210
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,208
Rym: Anything we say about computers, you can take that as professional advice.

211
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:07,819
Rym: Yup.

212
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:09,245
Scott: It's free.

213
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:10,256
Scott: Free of charge.

214
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:11,710
Scott: Usually, we charge a lot of money for that.

215
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:15,528
Rym: Yeah, my consulting rates vary depending on what mood I'm in.

216
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:16,579
Scott: And what you're asking for.

217
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:17,082
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:19,507
Scott: Hey, consult me on some embedded Linux stuff.

219
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,124
Scott: Sure, I'll do that for ten bucks an hour.

220
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:25,650
Scott: Hey, consult me on some Apache shit on Windows.

221
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:28,015
Scott: Yeah, that's gonna be a hundred bucks a minute.

222
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,592
Rym: If someone tries to get me to work on a weekend, I don't think anyone in the world could afford that.

223
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,158
Scott: A thousand bucks a second.

224
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:37,793
Rym: Personal ball washer.

225
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:39,187
Scott: Personal ball washer.

226
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:39,511
Scott: Alright.

227
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:41,190
Rym: Alright, anyway, we got some news.

228
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:42,040
Scott: Yup.

229
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,540
Rym: Now, we were just talking about juries and democracy.

230
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,287
Rym: And part of that, we were talking about net neutrality.

231
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:52,986
Rym: Well, Google hasn't fired the big guns yet, but they've loaded the big guns and rolled out the battleship.

232
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,812
Rym: Google is just waiting for the shit to hit the fan.

233
00:14:56,175 --> 00:15:02,740
Rym: They basically said today that if the ISPs decide that they're going to go this route, Google is going to wait.

234
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:09,225
Rym: And the moment they do anything bad, Google is going to let fly with the lawyers and the antitrust suits.

235
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:10,235
Rym: Hooray.

236
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:11,550
Rym: Like before you can blink.

237
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:31,549
Scott: See, what people have to realize is that companies like telcos and record companies and movie companies and all these guys doing all the evil things getting laws passed in Washington, all these companies are getting laws passed in Washington because A, they're very old companies who haven't upgraded to deal with the new world.

238
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,840
Scott: B, because of that, they're not making a lot of money.

239
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,760
Scott: They're not huge in the megabucks.

240
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,420
Rym: But they have a lot of experience.

241
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:42,114
Scott: And C, they have a lot of experience in lobbying.

242
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:43,912
Scott: They know how to get laws passed.

243
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:47,509
Scott: They don't know how to do business in the new world, but they know how to make laws.

244
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:54,132
Rym: They also have senators and representatives and lobbyists that they bought and paid for way back when they did make a lot of money.

245
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,274
Rym: And those people haven't been bought again.

246
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:57,406
Rym: So they're still in Congress.

247
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:02,520
Scott: Now you got people on the other end like Google and Microsoft and Yahoo.

248
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,059
Scott: and who else?

249
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:05,366
Rym: All the big ones.

250
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:06,113
Rym: Verizon.

251
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:07,426
Scott: Verizon's a telco.

252
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:08,680
Scott: They're on the bad side.

253
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,497
Rym: But Verizon hasn't said much about net neutrality.

254
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:11,285
Scott: Actually they have.

255
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,519
Scott: They don't want net neutrality.

256
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,123
Scott: Really?

257
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,012
Scott: Yes, they're fuckers.

258
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:14,982
Rym: I didn't catch that.

259
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:15,447
Rym: I've been seeing.

260
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,466
Rym: most of the stuff I've been seeing has come from like Comcast.

261
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:21,446
Scott: See, the reason that those companies don't want net neutrality is this, right?

262
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,539
Scott: They don't want to be just a provider of bits.

263
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:28,660
Scott: If you're just a provider of bits, you're not going to make a lot of money.

264
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,194
Scott: It's the same thing with cell phones.

265
00:16:30,476 --> 00:16:32,153
Scott: You don't make a lot of money, you're just providing bits.

266
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:38,700
Scott: You have to provide all these services on top of those bits, like your ringtones and your game downloads and all that jazz.

267
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,225
Rym: Now you know what?

268
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:41,063
Rym: It's the same way with electricity and water.

269
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:45,792
Rym: The electric company here that we use, they make dick.

270
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:48,299
Rym: They barely break even.

271
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:53,330
Rym: They make enough money to pay all of their employees and get electricity and gas to us.

272
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,795
Rym: And I hate to break it to the telecos, but data is now a commodity like that.

273
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:01,855
Rym: Data is just a resource.

274
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,168
Rym: It is nothing special anymore.

275
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:04,723
Scott: And you're going to have to make dick.

276
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,925
Scott: That's what you're providing.

277
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:13,250
Scott: The thing is, people like Verizon want to make a lot of money by providing services on top of their bits.

278
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:20,035
Scott: They want you to use Verizon's version of YouTube, Verizon's search engine, Verizon's this, Verizon's that.

279
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:23,894
Scott: They don't have all those things, but they have a lot of online services.

280
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:32,120
Scott: They want you to use their services instead of other services like Skype or anything like that, which is why net neutrality is something they don't want.

281
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:40,340
Scott: Because if there was net neutrality, you can use other services just as easily as you could use Verizon services if you're a Verizon customer.

282
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,805
Scott: But without net neutrality, they can make it so that Verizon services work faster and better if you're a Verizon customer than Skype or YouTube.

283
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:54,360
Scott: Or they can make it so you can't use Skype at all and you can only use Verizon's equivalent.

284
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:57,149
Rym: Some IPs have already begun doing this with Skype.

285
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:58,927
Scott: In Canada, it's big.

286
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:02,846
Scott: The Canadian ISPs are big on blocking stuff and making you use their stuff.

287
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:03,411
Rym: Yep.

288
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:09,170
Scott: It's going back to the days of AOL where you were walled off from the real internet and you were forced to just use AOL's shit.

289
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:13,253
Rym: Yeah, which was actually great because it kept all those people away from me and Usenet.

290
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:13,960
Scott: Yeah.

291
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:21,414
Scott: I think what might end up happening is there'll be some real ISPs and then fake ISPs and people like us might pay for the real ISPs, the premium money.

292
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:23,595
Rym: Well, alright, here's rumor mill time.

293
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:27,737
Rym: Even though this has been kind of a not really, no one really knows exactly what's going on.

294
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:28,647
Scott: Google with the dark fiber?

295
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:31,515
Rym: Yeah, Google bought up all the dark fiber.

296
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,252
Scott: But they've been buying it for a long time.

297
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:38,180
Rym: And they've got this massive, supposedly still unused network of fiber.

298
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:43,251
Rym: And they've also acquired many IPv6 addresses and all sorts of things.

299
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:48,160
Rym: It's not out of the realm that Google would just make an ISP and give the giant finger to everyone.

300
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,716
Scott: Yeah, Google might just like turn on the GoogleNet, which is IPv6 and make it fast.

301
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:54,709
Rym: You mean Skynet.

302
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:55,519
Scott: Exactly.

303
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:56,888
Scott: Exactly.

304
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,412
Rym: The other thing, Google didn't say this.

305
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,420
Rym: This is me speculating.

306
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:04,000
Rym: But I think the antitrust suits are only the first salvo.

307
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:10,018
Rym: I think if like Comcast or Verizon said, "Google, pay us more or we won't allow people to go to

308
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:10,220
Rym: Google."

309
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,794
Rym: Google would say, "You know what?

310
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,280
Rym: Let's see how your customers feel if they can't get to Google anymore.

311
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,046
Rym: Have fun.

312
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:15,532
Rym: See

313
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:15,755
Rym: ya.".

314
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:38,924
Scott: No, see what I think is, back to my original point, is that while all these companies like Teleco's record and movie companies are doing all these evil laws and not making a lot of money, but are good at lobbying, the tech companies like Google and Microsoft and all of them are not good at lobbying, but they are good at lawyers and they have much, much more money.

315
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:41,089
Rym: I've got a 17 in lawyer.

316
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:41,880
Scott: Exactly.

317
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,926
Scott: They're loaded.

318
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:49,556
Scott: Google and Microsoft combined could buy Verizon and BellSouth with lots of money left over.

319
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:53,873
Scott: Google is bigger than Verizon by a lot.

320
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:55,148
Scott: Billions upon billions of dollars.

321
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:56,786
Rym: It's the same thing with all the DRM stuff.

322
00:19:56,846 --> 00:20:00,460
Rym: I mean, Microsoft could just destroy the entire recording industry if they wanted.

323
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,002
Scott: Yep.

324
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:03,006
Rym: They could just buy it and give away all the music.

325
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:04,160
Scott: But they don't.

326
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,458
Rym: Yeah, not yet.

327
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,747
Scott: But they could.

328
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:14,442
Scott: So these companies, you know, if Google doesn't want something to happen and we don't have to really worry about it.

329
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:19,413
Scott: So as long as Google doesn't turn evil and they haven't yet, except for the China stuff.

330
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,960
Rym: And even then, Google's been the least evil of everyone.

331
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:22,464
Rym: Yeah.

332
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:28,623
Rym: I mean, I really have lost a lot of what little respect I had left for Yahoo after what's been going on.

333
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:29,451
Rym: Yeah.

334
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:31,882
Rym: Yahoo was awesome in 1994.

335
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:36,323
Rym: But as long as That was 12 years ago.

336
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:37,172
Rym: Oh, my God.

337
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,930
Rym: I feel so old.

338
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,496
Scott: As long as Google is still there with its mad money.

339
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:43,940
Scott: 12 years.

340
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,585
Scott: That's half my life.

341
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:47,819
Scott: Net neutrality isn't a worry because Google will just blow it away.

342
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:48,932
Scott: So, hooray.

343
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:52,673
Scott: All right.

344
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:56,588
Scott: So, Nintendo, who doesn't have as much money as Google.

345
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,326
Rym: But they have a lot of freaking money.

346
00:20:58,347 --> 00:20:59,258
Scott: Yeah, they do.

347
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:03,280
Scott: It's President Bush's 60th birthday today.

348
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,978
Rym: We're gonna leave the politics out of it.

349
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:08,273
Rym: I think you all know our feelings on our wonderful leader.

350
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,127
Scott: Nintendo sent him a birthday present which is a DS Lite and brain training.

351
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:18,650
Scott: Now, on the one hand, you say, oh, that's good.

352
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:23,763
Scott: Now he'll understand about video games if he actually plays it or actually looks at the gift or anything like that.

353
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,715
Scott: But on the other hand, aren't they kind of insulting him?

354
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,839
Scott: Like, here, you kind of need some brain training.

355
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:36,776
Scott: Yeah, and a lot of people on the internet made a bunch of jokes about it and, like, yeah, they should have sent him this back in '91.

356
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,169
Scott: He needed this a while ago, et cetera, et cetera.

357
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:45,665
Rym: Now, we've had an idea for a long time, not for a long time, for at least months that we've been ruminating about.

358
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:46,554
Scott: Maybe in a couple weeks.

359
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:47,846
Rym: Yeah, we've had it for a while.

360
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:48,796
Scott: Not that long.

361
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:49,866
Rym: Yeah, it's been a while.

362
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:57,662
Rym: The idea is that what if we put together a fund to raise the money to buy a DS and two games for every member of the Senate?

363
00:21:58,107 --> 00:22:03,844
Scott: Yep, that's a hundred DS lights, which is, what, $13,000-something dollars?

364
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,845
Rym: Eh, the point is just that you think that would work.

365
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:15,805
Rym: I mean, people did that with the iPod back in the day, and it seemed to have a fairly big impact on what senators thought about music online.

366
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:23,784
Scott: So, if we send them all DS lights with, you know, brain age and, I don't know, what's another good one?

367
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:26,531
Rym: Uh, Nintendogs would probably be good for that kind of purpose.

368
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:32,410
Scott: Yeah, Nintendogs, you know, will they change what they think about video games and stop trying to do evil video game laws?

369
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:33,420
Scott: Maybe.

370
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:38,188
Rym: Yeah, but we'll talk about that on a gaming day, because it's not gaming day, it's anime day.

371
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,899
Scott: Maybe we should send one to Jack Thompson.

372
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:42,691
Rym: He'd probably just kill us.

373
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:43,520
Scott: Maybe.

374
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:58,795
Rym: Alright, we went on for a long time there, but it is anime day, and we will be talking about anime after we talk about things that possibly exploded.

375
00:22:58,815 --> 00:23:01,790
Rym: My thing of the day is something exploding.

376
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:02,895
Scott: Agree.

377
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:06,210
Rym: It's one more final firework thing of the day, and then I'll be done.

378
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,950
Rym: I've got it out of my system, but this is a fireworks factory that had an accident and exploded.

379
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:30,450
Rym: There's a dude on a roof filming it, and it includes the choice moment where he realizes this might be dangerous and starts running away while he's filming it, and then there's a big explosion that kind of, like, knocks him down a little bit, and then he's laying there, obviously cowering, as debris and shrapnel and explosions fly everywhere.

380
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:34,735
Scott: Yeah, I wish I would have seen this yesterday.

381
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:36,430
Scott: I think I dug it a while ago.

382
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,909
Scott: I just didn't remember it till now, but wow.

383
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:47,570
Scott: This is, if you thought the bottle rockets or the firecrackers were big, this is a whole fireworks factory.

384
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,082
Rym: Yeah, this is awesome.

385
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:51,562
Rym: This is insane.

386
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,925
Rym: Now, the guy doesn't get hurt, so don't worry about anything like that.

387
00:23:53,985 --> 00:23:54,752
Rym: Just enjoy the boobs.

388
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:56,570
Scott: No, he's lying there dead with the camera rolling.

389
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,529
Scott: Some guy picked up the film and popped it on the net.

390
00:23:59,170 --> 00:23:59,707
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure.

391
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:01,969
Rym: All right, what you got?

392
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:09,789
Scott: So, this is video going around, and it's not really a typical thing of the day.

393
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,802
Scott: It's this guy, and he's sort of, we call him Belly Man.

394
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:18,010
Scott: That's been his nickname on the net, is Belly Man, because he has a large belly.

395
00:24:18,812 --> 00:24:20,049
Rym: A beer gut, if you will.

396
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:21,223
Scott: A little bigger than that.

397
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:21,769
Rym: If I may.

398
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:30,758
Scott: It juts out quite much, so that his shirt is hanging over the end of it, and not returning to his waist.

399
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,621
Rym: I'm surprised he didn't belly buster those kids.

400
00:24:32,682 --> 00:24:33,210
Scott: I'm surprised.

401
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:34,498
Scott: He tried to.

402
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:43,589
Scott: Anyway, he's standing around with his two little daughters, and he looks kind of like one of those dads carrying dad shit, like a fanny pack and all.

403
00:24:44,654 --> 00:24:46,609
Scott: It looks like one of those little family dad guys.

404
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:51,880
Scott: And there's three young, teenage kids skateboarding.

405
00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:53,679
Scott: Happily skateboarding.

406
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,396
Rym: Seriously, they're not doing anything wrong.

407
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:58,164
Scott: They're just minding their own business skateboarding, right?

408
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:02,930
Scott: And sure, it might be an area in which skateboarding is not allowed, but that's not the point.

409
00:25:03,391 --> 00:25:04,950
Rym: And there don't seem to be signs or anything.

410
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:06,769
Scott: Yeah, there are no signs that I can see.

411
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,255
Scott: And one of the skateboarding kids, obviously, is a video camera.

412
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:18,850
Scott: Now, the video starts out where this guy comes over to the kids, and he's like, "I'm gonna go get the manager and tell them to make you

413
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,092
Scott: leave.".

414
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:26,769
Scott: And they're like, skateboarding kids are like, "Alright, if we're not supposed to be skateboarding here, then you go do that, and the guy will come to tell us to leave and we'll leave.

415
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,527
Scott: And until then, we'll just stay here and skateboard while we wait for

416
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:30,628
Scott: you.".

417
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:36,809
Scott: Now, the guy gets all pissed off and all in the face of this little kid who's like, must be 13 or something.

418
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,639
Rym: Yeah, maybe.

419
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,469
Rym: These kids are young.

420
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:43,230
Scott: These kids are 13, 14, maybe 15, but I'm thinking 13, 14.

421
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,669
Rym: And this is a big adult.

422
00:25:44,952 --> 00:25:50,889
Scott: This is like a 40-year-old dad with his two little, like, six to eight-year-old daughters standing there.

423
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:56,929
Rym: Now, the presence of these six to eight-year-old daughters does not prevent him from saying the word "fuck" a whole bunch of times.

424
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:57,735
Scott: Yeah.

425
00:25:58,322 --> 00:25:59,801
Scott: He's just like, you know, "You have trouble

426
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:00,187
Scott: listening.".

427
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:07,073
Scott: Like, this guy's not these kids' parents and he's talking to them like he's some sort of, you know, like he must, I don't know.

428
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:12,569
Rym: Like, he was acting like he's an authority figure that they have to listen to when, honestly, he's just a dude.

429
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:15,700
Rym: He's not affiliated with this plaza they're skateboarding on.

430
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:18,590
Scott: He's not a, he might live there, but he's not a police officer.

431
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:24,470
Scott: He's not their teacher in school, which really would be the same thing, but he's nothing to these kids.

432
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,910
Scott: He's a complete stranger.

433
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,438
Scott: If, you know, if kids listen to their parents, you don't talk to strangers, let alone do what they tell you to do.

434
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:32,932
Rym: And the kids play it real cool.

435
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:34,202
Rym: They're just like, "Alright, man, whatever.

436
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:34,625
Rym: Just leave us

437
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:34,987
Rym: alone.".

438
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:35,674
Rym: Yeah.

439
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:37,153
Rym: And then he attacks them.

440
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,790
Scott: Well, no, he goes away, and then you see this kid skateboarding a little bit.

441
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:45,618
Scott: But obviously this guy, after walking away, noticed that the kids are still skateboarding.

442
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:49,719
Scott: So he runs up and grabs one of the kids' skateboards and starts running away.

443
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:54,609
Scott: The kid runs over, tries to grab it, and basically this guy fights with this little kid.

444
00:26:56,117 --> 00:27:00,209
Scott: The 40-year-old man is like beating on a little 12-year-old, trying to steal his skateboard.

445
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,930
Rym: Now, this is what's wrong with American society.

446
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:12,323
Scott: This is like a little one-half-minute video that shows everything that is wrong with the world today.

447
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:13,415
Rym: Almost everything.

448
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:15,434
Scott: Everything is wrong with our society today.

449
00:27:15,454 --> 00:27:20,110
Scott: I mean, you've got people who can't mind their own business.

450
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,589
Scott: They're bothered by what other people are doing that has nothing to do with them.

451
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:27,616
Rym: I mean, the guy keeps making it like he's yelling like, "This is dangerous.

452
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:28,343
Rym: My daughters are

453
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:28,504
Rym: here.".

454
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,585
Rym: But they were nowhere near this guy.

455
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:32,670
Rym: They were skateboarding on the other side of this park.

456
00:27:33,072 --> 00:27:33,537
Scott: Yep.

457
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:48,690
Scott: It shows parents setting bad examples for their children and blaming other things like skateboarding kids and video games and such for the ails of their children, when in fact the ails of their children are by shitty parents who beat up kids in front of their little daughters.

458
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,142
Rym: Yeah, seriously.

459
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:54,770
Rym: Beating up a kid in front of your own kids is... I don't know what to say.

460
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,911
Rym: If I had seen... If I had been there and I had seen this, I would have attacked the guy and called 911.

461
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:02,869
Scott: Yeah, see, like, I'm not a violent dude.

462
00:28:03,913 --> 00:28:08,910
Scott: And, you know, these kids are way cooler than us because they handle it so well.

463
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,099
Scott: Like, the kid says, you can hear him in the video, like, "What are you, nuts?

464
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:13,515
Scott: You're attacking a little kid.

465
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:14,930
Scott: He's just a kid, man.

466
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,717
Scott: What's wrong with

467
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:15,960
Scott: you?".

468
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:17,394
Scott: And that's exactly right.

469
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:18,223
Scott: What is wrong with him?

470
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:19,516
Rym: Of course, that just makes the guy matter.

471
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,374
Scott: Yeah, but he's real... You know, he's got a lot of gall to attack little kids.

472
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:28,269
Scott: If those guys were 20-year-old skateboarders, he wouldn't have done shit.

473
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:31,313
Scott: He would have been all scared and not gone anywhere near the thing.

474
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:35,940
Rym: Now, to paraphrase Jerry Seinfeld, one of his bits a long time ago, "What is wrong?

475
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:39,741
Rym: What is going on in your life that would make you do something like

476
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:40,006
Rym: that?".

477
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:49,070
Scott: Yeah, this guy is real lucky there was no one like us nearby because he would have been, had the shit kicked out of him in front of his daughters.

478
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:50,890
Scott: And then they would have learned a lesson.

479
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:58,261
Rym: And also, I don't know, I'm going to try to follow up on this because I sincerely hope that charges are pressed against this guy.

480
00:28:58,584 --> 00:28:59,210
Scott: Oh, seriously.

481
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,650
Rym: I mean, this video is all over the internet.

482
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:02,043
Rym: These kids aren't stupid.

483
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,429
Rym: I'm going to try to track them down and see if I can get them on the show.

484
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,114
Scott: I mean, people get in trouble for impairing the morals of kids and stuff.

485
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,901
Scott: You should be in trouble for impairing the morals of his daughters.

486
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:14,609
Rym: Yeah, the exact phrase is "contributing to the delinquents of a

487
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:14,993
Rym: minor.".

488
00:29:15,135 --> 00:29:36,184
Scott: Yeah, and I mean, if if it was really against some sort of rule or the kids are trespassing or something and not allowed to skateboard there, or if somehow their skateboards were damaging something and it could be vandalism of some sort, why didn't he just go and get the police or the landlord or the superintendent or the security guard or whoever and let them handle it?

489
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:36,910
Scott: No.

490
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,629
Scott: He's on some crazy.

491
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,225
Scott: he's got some psychological problem.

492
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:45,741
Scott: He's got to go and be some sort of, you know, vigilante big man guy, which is wrong.

493
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:49,195
Rym: I mean, I could see if it was his property and they were scuffing it up.

494
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:51,781
Scott: Yeah, if it was your house, then it's okay.

495
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:57,699
Scott: You know, if some kid is on your lawn doing stuff that is damaging... Get off my lawn, you damn kids.

496
00:29:57,902 --> 00:30:01,556
Scott: Yeah, you know, as much as get off my lawn, you damn kids is, you know, cliche.

497
00:30:01,576 --> 00:30:02,870
Scott: There's nothing wrong with that.

498
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,173
Scott: It's your lawn, you know, that's what you can do.

499
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:06,950
Scott: This is some sort, it's not.

500
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:13,295
Scott: it doesn't look like a public place, but it's definitely some sort of apartment building is nearby.

501
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:13,699
Scott: You know what?

502
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,890
Rym: It's the kind of place I used to hang out in Rollerblade when I was a punk kid.

503
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,859
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

504
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:18,709
Rym: And you know what?

505
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:20,649
Rym: Old men never tried to beat me up.

506
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:22,281
Scott: That's right.

507
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:25,558
Rym: Yeah, once I was chased by the police, but I was doing something else at the time.

508
00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:38,060
Scott: At least it shows that the kids, you know, are usually the more sane than the adults, and we really, you know, need to stop persecuting kids so much and let them have the say because they're smarter than most of us.

509
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:40,444
Rym: Now, again, this does not apply to all kids.

510
00:30:40,565 --> 00:30:41,030
Scott: No, it doesn't.

511
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:44,122
Rym: And by nannies, we're not saying that all kids...

512
00:30:44,970 --> 00:31:00,501
Scott: The problem is, is that in general, our society tends to give adults rights and, you know, give you adults opinions, and kids have much fewer rights and are sort of oppressed by adults, and I think that's wrong.

513
00:31:00,622 --> 00:31:05,189
Rym: I mean, there are certain situations where that's perfectly justified because kids are young and they don't know things.

514
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,990
Rym: I mean, there are things that I did when I was young that were stupid.

515
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:09,997
Rym: There sure were.

516
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:13,410
Rym: And if I saw myself doing them now, I'd say, "What the fuck are you doing?

517
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,116
Scott: Stop right now!

518
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:14,642
Scott: Oh my god!

519
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:15,229
Rym: Aww!".

520
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:15,996
Rym: Stop that!

521
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:17,570
Rym: You're about to break your face!

522
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,030
Scott: Exactly.

523
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:19,998
Rym: But you know what?

524
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:26,047
Rym: I mean, kids need to do some things like that to be able to test the boundaries and learn what works and what doesn't.

525
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:30,369
Rym: Like, I jumped off the roof of my house once when I was a little kid.

526
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:35,068
Scott: Oh, we used to jump, like, off of, you know, second story porches to the ground.

527
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:35,511
Rym: Yep.

528
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:40,990
Rym: And I didn't hurt myself severely, but it hurt a lot, and I learned, "Alright, I can't jump that far without hurting

529
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:41,435
Rym: myself.".

530
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,629
Rym: And I never did it again.

531
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:43,122
Scott: Yep.

532
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:45,247
Scott: So, yeah.

533
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:52,289
Scott: There are a lot more things this video illustrates, but I don't want to go on and on forever, because that's not what this episode is about.

534
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,289
Scott: But, uh, yeah.

535
00:31:55,031 --> 00:32:01,576
Rym: So, uh, if you're an old, scary anime guy, and you're at a con, and you see kids goofing off, just let the kids goof off.

536
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:03,979
Scott: Yeah, or else, you know, think about it.

537
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:16,910
Scott: If you're the kind of guy walking around, and you see some, uh, people doing something in an anime con that you don't like, and you really feel like hitting them, like, you know, it would feel good, and you think they deserve it, watch this video.

538
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:18,589
Scott: You're the old guy.

539
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:23,334
Scott: Don't be that guy, because then guys like me, seeing you do that, will kill you.

540
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,142
Rym: Yep.

541
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:26,009
Scott: Or, bring you severe bodily harm.

542
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:32,790
Rym: Yeah, in fact, I remember a moment at, uh, an amazement where someone complained, like there was some kids being loud near the artist alley.

543
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,329
Rym: They were yelling and doing something fun.

544
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:40,770
Rym: And some artist in the room says, "Uh, sir," because, you know, I'm a security, "those kids are loud and annoying.

545
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,253
Rym: Stop

546
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:41,495
Rym: them.".

547
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:47,498
Rym: And I walk over, and the kids are just having fun, and no one complained but this one person, so I walk back, and I was like, "Eh, they can do what they

548
00:32:47,538 --> 00:32:47,740
Rym: want.".

549
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:48,789
Scott: There you go.

550
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:51,437
Rym: And, you know what, she didn't run over and try to hit him.

551
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:55,316
Scott: Yeah, and if she did, you would have been all security on her.

552
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:55,861
Rym: Yep.

553
00:32:56,387 --> 00:33:04,427
Rym: Now, the thing is, the kids were annoying me, too, and after another hour of this, I was thinking of shutting them down, but then the head of the con himself was like, "Eh, let him be kids.

554
00:33:04,447 --> 00:33:05,942
Rym: They'll tire themselves out, and they won't bother us

555
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:06,326
Rym: tomorrow.".

556
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:07,015
Scott: Huh?

557
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:07,603
Rym: Alright.

558
00:33:07,806 --> 00:33:08,009
Rym: Yeah.

559
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:19,962
Scott: I mean, if kids are making noise, you know, it's like, alright, but if they're doing, if their physical doings are troublesome, you know, and skateboarding is not troublesome, unless you're a crotchety old guy.

560
00:33:19,982 --> 00:33:23,336
Rym: Yeah, or unless, I mean, there are skateboard punks who do bad things.

561
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:29,620
Rym: They break property, they get in the way, they skateboard places they really shouldn't, they do things dangerously, but these kids were not doing any of those things.

562
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:30,590
Scott: Oh, another thing.

563
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:42,041
Scott: this illustrates that, the last thing I want to point out about it is, you know, some people who can't have fun, who have miserable lives, just can't stand to see other people having fun, and it pisses them off.

564
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:53,249
Scott: You know, like this guy, I don't imagine his life is too good, I mean, he has to deal with two daughters, he's dealing with all his dad shit, he probably has a shit job, he's living in some apartment complex thing.

565
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,590
Rym: No, no, to his credit, maybe, when he was young, a roving band of twelve-year-old skateboarders killed his parents.

566
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,334
Scott: Maybe.

567
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,921
Rym: And now he's on, now that was his anime moment.

568
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,579
Scott: But, if that was true, then why is he beating up twelve-year-old kids?

569
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:08,750
Scott: He should've become the Batman and beat up, like, forty-year-old villains.

570
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:10,909
Rym: Maybe those twelve-year-old kids are actually ninjas.

571
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:18,409
Scott: Uh, if those twelve-year-old kids are ninjas, that explains their high level of intelligence, and their worthiness of our respect.

572
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,530
Rym: It also means that that man is already dead.

573
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:24,009
Scott: Yup, which means, uh, we're never gonna hear from him again.

574
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:37,010
Rym: Yeah, but I'm really gonna try and follow up with this, and if, somehow, no one has followed up, like, if this guy hasn't been caught in any way, I'm gonna see if I can somehow get this video into the hands of people who would care.

575
00:34:37,915 --> 00:34:42,866
Scott: Yeah, I mean, we have no idea where this was, when it was, anything, we got nothing, so.

576
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:45,978
Rym: Yeah, but I've got a lot of means at my disposal.

577
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:47,029
Scott: Yeah, we'll try.

578
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,202
Rym: Like Google, and, and, yeah.

579
00:34:50,243 --> 00:34:50,529
Scott: Yeah.

580
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:52,150
Rym: Maybe some 4chan action.

581
00:34:53,936 --> 00:35:03,070
Rym: Anyway, anime day, we're gonna talk about Master Keaton, which is probably one of the most underrated anime to come out in the last decade.

582
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:03,955
Rym: Mm-hmm.

583
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,919
Rym: I mean, I had barely heard of it, no one I know had watched it, except the guys in Anime World Order.

584
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,314
Rym: We finally decided to pick it up, mainly because we got it for $40, all of it.

585
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:16,210
Rym: And it's badass.

586
00:35:17,651 --> 00:35:28,199
Rym: But before we talk about it, I just want to give a quick nod to the fact that, uh, and I only do this because I know people don't listen to all the days, but Scott and I appeared on GeekSpeak, talking about anime conventions not too long ago.

587
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:35,316
Scott: Yeah, so if you're interested in hearing us talk even more about anime conventions, if our episodes, what, three episodes about anime conventions?

588
00:35:35,336 --> 00:35:37,518
Rym: Yeah, not counting the coverage of each con we've gone to.

589
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,769
Scott: Yeah, it's not enough for you.

590
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,478
Scott: You can go to speakgeekspeak.com and get another episode of us talking about anime cons.

591
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:53,155
Rym: Though there are some interesting questions there, because it's, he kind of interviews us and he asks us a lot of questions about things that we probably wouldn't have thought to say anything about otherwise.

592
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:58,929
Scott: Yeah, I think that's, uh, real useful, 'cause, you know, the thing about this show is that we have lots of knowledge.

593
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,870
Scott: Lots of knowledges.

594
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,929
Scott: We're not omniscient.

595
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:05,557
Rym: But... Well, you're not.

596
00:36:06,002 --> 00:36:06,710
Scott: You're not either.

597
00:36:08,054 --> 00:36:10,829
Scott: But we do know a fuckton of stuff.

598
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:22,450
Scott: And just talking to each other, since we've said most things, and since we both know that we both know things, we don't really say those things, 'cause it's sort of, like, understood.

599
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:34,129
Scott: So having someone interview us is really the only easy way, or one of the only easy ways, for a lot of the information within our bodies to be communicated to the world.

600
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,703
Rym: Hence the episode "Ask Us Any

601
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:37,066
Rym: Question."

602
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:41,033
Rym: Yep, which went really well, and we're probably gonna have more of those in the future.

603
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:46,305
Scott: Yep, as soon as we get a lot more listeners so that we can get a lot more new questions of different varieties.

604
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:50,143
Rym: Yep, even though the graph of listenership is still somewhat exponential.

605
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:51,881
Scott: Yep, which is all good.

606
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:53,436
Rym: Yep, just wait 'til Otakon.

607
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,770
Rym: I think that's gonna be a big breaking point.

608
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,490
Rym: Not just for us, but for a lot of podcasters.

609
00:36:57,495 --> 00:37:02,450
Scott: Yeah, I mean, Anime Next had a crap ton of podcasting going on relative to the size of the convention.

610
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,410
Scott: I can only imagine how Otakon's gonna be.

611
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:09,137
Rym: I mean, Otakon has really had no podcasting presence before, at least no noticeable one.

612
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:15,137
Scott: Because podcasting really took off, you know, in the years since Otakon, you know.

613
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:20,270
Rym: Yep, and happily, we're going to be the ones to break podcasting out there with our giant panel.

614
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,149
Rym: But we'll talk about that more and more as Otakon comes up.

615
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:25,929
Rym: Today, Master Keaton.

616
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:27,016
Scott: Alright.

617
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:30,190
Rym: Now, we've only watched the first three episodes.

618
00:37:30,652 --> 00:37:32,877
Scott: And they were all completely different.

619
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,594
Scott: It's an episodic show so far.

620
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:40,796
Rym: Yep, but I mean, the first three episodes very much seemed to serve to enlighten us as to who is Master Keaton?

621
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,350
Rym: Why is he a master?

622
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:44,090
Rym: Why is his name Keaton?

623
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:45,249
Scott: What is the show about?

624
00:37:46,552 --> 00:37:51,201
Rym: And I've heard the show described to me in a bunch of various ways that didn't make much sense.

625
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:53,141
Rym: So I basically had to watch the show.

626
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:58,290
Scott: Yeah, people would say, "Oh, it's an archaeology something terrorist something

627
00:37:58,432 --> 00:37:58,695
Scott: show.".

628
00:37:58,715 --> 00:37:58,999
Scott: And I'm like,

629
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,322
Scott: "What?".

630
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:01,870
Rym: Yeah, one guy said it was Indiana Jones versus the terrorists.

631
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:03,670
Scott: And I was like, "What are you talking about?

632
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,139
Scott: Insurance agent?

633
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:05,846
Scott: What the

634
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:06,068
Scott: hell?".

635
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:10,190
Rym: Yeah, and it is very much all of those things and more.

636
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:11,282
Rym: Yep.

637
00:38:11,344 --> 00:38:13,787
Rym: I mean, everyone's seen Master Keaton.

638
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:14,878
Rym: It's in every anime store.

639
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,777
Rym: You see stuff from Master Keaton everywhere.

640
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:20,230
Scott: There's not really stuff for it, but the DVDs are widely available.

641
00:38:20,513 --> 00:38:21,464
Rym: And I've seen wall scrolls.

642
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:23,119
Rym: It's just, it's a dude.

643
00:38:23,382 --> 00:38:24,594
Rym: A normal looking dude.

644
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:25,502
Rym: He's very...

645
00:38:25,643 --> 00:38:29,077
Scott: He's not even that... The art is actually not spectacular.

646
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,005
Rym: I like it though.

647
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:30,449
Rym: I like the style.

648
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,810
Scott: It looks kind of like the second Lupin series with a bit of extra shininess.

649
00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:36,979
Rym: The guy is very much an oop-de-doop-de-doop guy.

650
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,250
Rym: And I guess... With a big nose.

651
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:38,854
Rym: You know what?

652
00:38:38,894 --> 00:38:44,390
Rym: We'll spoil the first episode because that's a great way by going through the episode to kind of explain what this show is about.

653
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,088
Scott: Yeah, also since it's episodic there's no major plot spoiler.

654
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:49,970
Scott: by explaining the first episode.

655
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,590
Scott: It's like if I told you the first episode of Cowboy Bebop.

656
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:57,408
Scott: I might spoil that episode because it sort of has a slightly twisty ending.

657
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:58,514
Scott: You know?

658
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:02,469
Scott: But it doesn't really spoil the show of Cowboy Bebop.

659
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,808
Scott: So, let's see.

660
00:39:04,372 --> 00:39:05,569
Scott: First episode of Master Keaton.

661
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:07,221
Rym: It starts with this guy.

662
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,230
Rym: This normal looking guy.

663
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,090
Rym: And it's kind of like the Indiana Jones where he's a teacher at a high school.

664
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:13,256
Scott: Yep.

665
00:39:13,276 --> 00:39:16,089
Scott: And he's teaching about archaeology of Greece.

666
00:39:16,513 --> 00:39:17,079
Scott: Ancient Greece.

667
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:20,546
Rym: Now, of course, just before this they show some guy falling to his death over a cliff.

668
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:28,229
Rym: And now you've got this guy teaching archaeology and he seems like a cool but very kind of nonchalant silly dude.

669
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,078
Scott: Yeah, like he's completely nondescript.

670
00:39:31,098 --> 00:39:33,808
Scott: Like usually you see a character and you know what kind of character they are.

671
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:40,654
Scott: Like the badass looks like a badass and the hot girl looks like a hot girl and this guy looks like generic dude.

672
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:43,482
Rym: I would call him a proto-Kaji or a proto-Hughes.

673
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:46,470
Rym: He's kind of that kind of character but much more subdued.

674
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,805
Scott: And much more clean shaven.

675
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:48,109
Scott: Yes.

676
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:50,088
Scott: And a bigger nose.

677
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,807
Rym: But, I mean, they, and right away they're dropping all these hints.

678
00:39:53,867 --> 00:39:59,603
Rym: Like he comes in and the headmaster of the school yells at him like, "Eh, your page slip came back.

679
00:39:59,623 --> 00:40:00,107
Rym: You must have moved

680
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:00,734
Rym: again.".

681
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:01,220
Rym: He's like, "Oh,

682
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:01,584
Rym: whatever.".

683
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:04,755
Rym: And he looks at it and he kind of groans at the meager pay.

684
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:09,563
Scott: And then he also, you know, as he leaves class he's like, "Oh yeah, no class next week

685
00:40:09,684 --> 00:40:09,906
Scott: either.".

686
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,999
Rym: And his students are like, "He always does this.

687
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:16,029
Scott: They're like, "We keep skipping cancelling class.

688
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:16,473
Scott: We want it.

689
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:18,575
Scott: We're paying a lot of money for this and you keep cancelling.

690
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:18,797
Scott: Screw

691
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:18,979
Scott: you.".

692
00:40:20,332 --> 00:40:23,060
Rym: But then it turns out he got a phone call from Lloyd's.

693
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:24,050
Scott: Lloyd's of London.

694
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,644
Scott: The giant insurance place.

695
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:29,929
Rym: And the show even goes to a somewhat decent pain to explain what Lloyd's of London is.

696
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:35,770
Scott: Because a lot of people don't exactly understand the difference between Lloyd's of London and your local insurance agent.

697
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,454
Rym: Yeah, they're, they're, we're not going to get into it.

698
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:38,999
Scott: No, we're not.

699
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,281
Scott: Lloyd's of London is basically the king of insurance.

700
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:41,989
Scott: That's all you need to know.

701
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:45,970
Rym: Just think big insurance company, like There isn't really a bigger insurance company.

702
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,830
Scott: They insure everything fancy.

703
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:54,336
Rym: If Trigun were a real world they're the ones who would have sent Millie and Merrill out to handle all that business with Vash.

704
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:55,110
Scott: Exactly.

705
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,394
Rym: So, he's called by them to go do something.

706
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:01,549
Rym: So he takes time off work and goes off to investigate this thing.

707
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:04,536
Rym: Which involves some sort of insurance scandal.

708
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,162
Scott: Yep.

709
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:12,330
Scott: Now, the insurance scandal that happens is the guy who was pushed off the cliff at the beginning of the show had life insurance.

710
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:20,150
Scott: The life insurance is going to not his long time woman, but to the Ox Art Company.

711
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:21,178
Rym: Yep, Ox Bear.

712
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:25,421
Scott: Ox, and the guy who owns the Ox Art Company is Ox Bear.

713
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,480
Rym: He is a shady looking dude.

714
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,804
Scott: He is a very looking shady evil dude.

715
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:31,745
Scott: And they make that pretty clear right away.

716
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:32,230
Rym: Yep.

717
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,109
Rym: So, and she lives on like this peninsula.

718
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:37,745
Scott: Well, his woman lives on this peninsula of Greece somewhere.

719
00:41:37,907 --> 00:41:38,635
Rym: And that's where he died.

720
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:39,770
Rym: It's an ancient village.

721
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:46,210
Rym: And now the funny thing is he makes a point like they mention multiple times that it's a windy island.

722
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:47,865
Rym: And that's important.

723
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:51,910
Rym: In fact, one thing I've noticed about the show is that anything and everything that happens is important.

724
00:41:52,332 --> 00:41:54,696
Scott: It's sort of like Scooby Doo, but not visually.

725
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:57,785
Scott: You know in a Scoo- I always say Scooby Doo a lot.

726
00:41:57,866 --> 00:42:11,180
Scott: I don't know if everyone understands this, but if you watch an old episode of Scooby Doo, and you look at the image, in those days the coloring on the cells of animation would be really bright and stand out from the background.

727
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:17,481
Scott: So, you could tell if something was going to be animated because it would have to be on the cell.

728
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:21,643
Scott: And you could tell if something wasn't going to be animated because it would be in the background.

729
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:27,299
Scott: And the one example I always remember is that Scooby and Shaggy were standing next to this well with a bucket.

730
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,783
Scott: You know those wells they always have in cartoons.

731
00:42:29,823 --> 00:42:30,066
Scott: Yep.

732
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:31,823
Rym: That don't exist anywhere really anymore.

733
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:32,954
Scott: Exactly those.

734
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:34,611
Scott: And they were standing next to it.

735
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:36,830
Scott: And the well was this brighter color.

736
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,590
Scott: It stood out from the background.

737
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:44,529
Scott: It was on the cell, which means you knew they were going to fall into the well or that a ghost was going to come out of it.

738
00:42:45,172 --> 00:42:46,851
Scott: It's just obvious because it stands out.

739
00:42:46,871 --> 00:42:49,378
Rym: Like they're walking down a hallway and there's a bunch of lockers during the school.

740
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:51,175
Rym: And one of the lockers is all bright.

741
00:42:51,357 --> 00:42:53,238
Rym: That locker's going to pop open or they're going to open it.

742
00:42:53,643 --> 00:42:54,130
Scott: Exactly.

743
00:42:54,691 --> 00:43:01,056
Scott: So, when something is Scooby Doo, that means it stands out from everything else and is obviously important.

744
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,849
Scott: Now, the thing- Without it being said, this is an important thing.

745
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,570
Rym: Now, the things don't seem obviously important like way back when the payslip thing.

746
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:09,538
Rym: And they're like, "Give us your new

747
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:09,902
Rym: address."

748
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,640
Rym: And he's writing it down and he rips these to paper.

749
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:14,590
Rym: And the guy hands him some tape to tape up the paper.

750
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,330
Rym: And he just kind of pockets it and walks away.

751
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,053
Scott: And the guy's like, "Hey, Keaton stole my tape.

752
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:20,488
Scott: That's a Scooby Doo

753
00:43:20,508 --> 00:43:20,670
Scott: thing.".

754
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,378
Scott: It stands out and it becomes important later.

755
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:31,717
Rym: So, he gets to the island and sure enough, right away he sees these insurance guys and they're very thuggish, threatening the woman.

756
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:33,433
Scott: Well, they're not insurance guys.

757
00:43:33,474 --> 00:43:35,450
Rym: They're the Ox Bear Art Company.

758
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,579
Rym: And they're threatening this woman about something.

759
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:46,182
Scott: And at first, the first time I watched it, because I've seen the episode twice, I thought that the woman might also be in on some sort of scam.

760
00:43:46,202 --> 00:43:47,838
Scott: I didn't know who was the bad guy.

761
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:49,130
Scott: The Ox Bear Art Company or the woman.

762
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:50,201
Scott: Or both.

763
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:50,730
Scott: Or neither.

764
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,706
Rym: Now, this is the point at which the show- This is when the show really took a turn and we started figuring out what was going on.

765
00:43:56,787 --> 00:44:02,889
Rym: Because the situation's going on and Keaton drops some garbage over the edge.

766
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:04,750
Rym: Just as they're about to shoot this woman.

767
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,059
Rym: And then he leans over like, "Oi!

768
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:07,755
Rym: I dropped that!

769
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,402
Rym: Sorry!

770
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:09,250
Rym: Nah nah nah nah nah!

771
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:10,119
Rym: I'm just some dumb

772
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:10,402
Rym: guy.".

773
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:14,302
Scott: And then he comes down to pick it up and the Ox Art guys walk away.

774
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:16,947
Rym: Because, you know, they're not going to shoot in front of this person.

775
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:17,736
Rym: They don't know what's going on.

776
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:18,910
Rym: They're just going to wait for another time.

777
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:25,109
Scott: Yeah, I mean, this village is empty because it's one of those seasonal places where people only come in a certain time of the year.

778
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:33,756
Scott: And this time of the year, the only people there are the woman, the guy who fell off the cliff, and these Ox Art guys, and Master Keaton who came to investigate.

779
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,179
Rym: Now, at this point, I wasn't sure of something.

780
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:46,530
Rym: Because for any of us who've seen Trigun, for much of the early part of the show, you're wondering if Vash is actually awesome or just an idiot.

781
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:48,950
Rym: And Master Keaton had that same feeling.

782
00:44:49,571 --> 00:44:53,958
Rym: We had a debate while we were watching the episode of "Alright, is he an idiot or is he badass?

783
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:56,526
Rym: And if he's badass, how badass is

784
00:44:56,647 --> 00:44:56,789
Rym: he?".

785
00:44:57,498 --> 00:44:58,490
Scott: I knew he was badass.

786
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:03,432
Scott: He's the main character in the show, and you know that he's going to come out on top at the end of this episode.

787
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:05,757
Rym: But he might have been like a Captain Tyler badass.

788
00:45:05,797 --> 00:45:06,161
Scott: Exactly.

789
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:09,010
Scott: Well, I don't think he was a Captain Tyler badass because he wasn't goofy.

790
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,230
Rym: No, no, but he might have been.

791
00:45:10,892 --> 00:45:13,090
Scott: My question was, how badass is he?

792
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:18,729
Scott: I mean, does he get out of situations with clever stuff that doesn't involve violence?

793
00:45:19,813 --> 00:45:22,608
Scott: Or, can he take out a gun and kill everyone when he needs to?

794
00:45:23,073 --> 00:45:26,670
Scott: You know, what's his level and type of badassness?

795
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,919
Rym: Because they haven't told you really anything about him yet.

796
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:37,659
Scott: Yeah, you don't have his background, you know nothing except that his name is Master Keaton, he teaches archaeology, and Lloyd's of London hired him to do something.

797
00:45:37,962 --> 00:45:40,249
Rym: Now I'm going to say right now what level of badass he is.

798
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:47,389
Rym: He is the badass wherein if he goes to a gunfight and everyone else has guns, he doesn't need a gun.

799
00:45:48,632 --> 00:45:58,809
Scott: Yeah, in a world where no one has superpowers, Master Keaton is the most dangerous, most badass motherfucker on the earth, if there are no weapons also, I guess.

800
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:03,476
Rym: Yep, even though he's the most normal looking, doo doo kind of guy.

801
00:46:03,517 --> 00:46:09,314
Scott: And he's all, and usually his demeanor really doesn't match his badassness level at all.

802
00:46:09,335 --> 00:46:12,550
Scott: He's all smiley and friendly and cool.

803
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,284
Scott: You know, he's not torn by war or anything like that.

804
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:18,324
Scott: He's just a happy friendly teacher-y guy.

805
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:26,975
Rym: And in fact one thing you notice is that as you watch more of the show, it's obvious that every single thing he says and does is 100% calculated.

806
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:29,980
Rym: Like if he just makes an offhand...

807
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,850
Scott: At least when he's on a mission.

808
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,790
Rym: Yeah, if he just makes an offhand comment, he did that for a reason.

809
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,179
Scott: Absolutely.

810
00:46:36,442 --> 00:46:46,950
Rym: And the other thing is that the moments where the badass comes out, like the moment when action happens and there's a sudden fight, one the action is over almost immediately.

811
00:46:47,132 --> 00:46:48,390
Scott: Yeah, take that Naruto.

812
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:51,857
Scott: You know, friggin' 10 episodes of a fight.

813
00:46:51,938 --> 00:46:55,209
Scott: Master Keaton uses like 10 seconds and he takes everyone out.

814
00:46:56,093 --> 00:47:03,030
Rym: Two, the smile goes away and he just has this like the coldest like "I am a badass" looked about his face.

815
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:07,839
Scott: And a lot of times you don't even see the action involving Master Keaton himself.

816
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:08,870
Scott: You just kinda.

817
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,677
Scott: they kinda show you enough so that you know what he did.

818
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:14,148
Scott: And they show you the results of what he did.

819
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:19,548
Scott: But they never actually show you in full animation him doing everything badass.

820
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,009
Scott: I think I saw him kick a guy once.

821
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,289
Rym: Well, in this first episode he does a bit.

822
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,410
Rym: But, you know, he goes back, talks to the woman.

823
00:47:26,714 --> 00:47:27,929
Rym: they basically resolve the plot.

824
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:33,118
Rym: The evil oxbearer guys realize that "Alright, he's here to talk to this woman.

825
00:47:33,824 --> 00:47:35,097
Rym: Let's just go kill them both.

826
00:47:35,138 --> 00:47:35,481
Rym: There are no

827
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:35,926
Rym: witnesses.".

828
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:43,190
Rym: Now, Master Keaton is talking to the woman and suddenly he's like "Huuuuh" and he looks out the window and he sees these guys coming.

829
00:47:43,951 --> 00:47:47,910
Rym: And at this point the full badass comes out and you really start wondering "How is he this

830
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:48,515
Rym: badass?".

831
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:50,493
Rym: They explain that as well, but I'll get to that.

832
00:47:50,554 --> 00:47:55,605
Scott: Yeah, he reaches over, he's in a little tiny cottage and he goes to get a wooden spoon.

833
00:47:55,787 --> 00:47:56,840
Rym: He grabs a wooden spoon.

834
00:47:57,367 --> 00:47:59,949
Rym: Also, he asks the girl if there's a back way out.

835
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,949
Rym: She says "Yes" and he says "Wait a minute" and he's fiddling with things.

836
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:07,623
Rym: And all the while he's explaining like "They've got

837
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,128
Rym: guns."

838
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:09,542
Rym: And he explains why.

839
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:10,755
Rym: he knows they've got guns.

840
00:48:10,815 --> 00:48:18,717
Rym: Because they're wearing sport coats but the sport coats are buttoned and they're holding their right arms away from their body which means they've got a left mounted weapon.

841
00:48:19,503 --> 00:48:21,199
Rym: And it's pretty realistic stuff.

842
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:23,869
Rym: I could see detectives using similar deductive methods.

843
00:48:24,811 --> 00:48:25,338
Rym: Well, yeah.

844
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:34,613
Rym: Anyway, and then they run off and the guys see him and they shoot at him and he's running away and you're wondering "Alright, how is he going to resolve

845
00:48:34,654 --> 00:48:34,816
Rym: this?".

846
00:48:35,018 --> 00:48:36,089
Rym: He's got a spoon.

847
00:48:36,852 --> 00:48:38,530
Rym: He's also got some tape if you remember.

848
00:48:39,474 --> 00:48:44,344
Scott: And also earlier in the episode there was another Scooby Doo moment where he says "Oh, this keystone is

849
00:48:44,385 --> 00:48:44,627
Scott: loose.".

850
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,034
Rym: Yeah, like there's an arch and a keystone is loose.

851
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:48,973
Rym: And also the island is very windy.

852
00:48:49,842 --> 00:48:51,196
Rym: Now how does all this come together?

853
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:54,490
Scott: Well, he runs away a lot with the girl.

854
00:48:54,970 --> 00:49:00,650
Rym: And he gets to the area he wants to be and he gets to a point where they see him and start running after him shooting.

855
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:08,729
Rym: He ducks around the corner, takes a stick, jams it into the unstable earthworks, and knocks over this giant wall, taking two of the guys out.

856
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,135
Scott: Yeah, the rocks fall on their head and they're gone.

857
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:21,904
Rym: Then the rest of the guys come around the corner, guns drawn, and he's made basically a sling kind of device out of this spoon and the tape and a stick.

858
00:49:23,331 --> 00:49:26,894
Rym: Yeah, and he rips these rocks at the guys and takes them all out except the head guy.

859
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:35,820
Scott: He throws two rocks, obviously rocks from the crumbled wall, and he hits two of the guys in the head, square in the front of the head with flying rocks.

860
00:49:35,841 --> 00:49:36,850
Rym: Like they're down.

861
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,197
Scott: Yeah, only Ox Beyer is left.

862
00:49:39,862 --> 00:49:41,681
Rym: And they're standing there confronting each other.

863
00:49:41,702 --> 00:49:48,290
Rym: And now I'll note that when Ox Beyer first saw Master Keaton, he thought that guy looks kind of familiar.

864
00:49:49,275 --> 00:49:55,135
Rym: And also, when Master Keaton was first given the picture of Ox Beyer, he thought, "I know this

865
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:55,559
Rym: dude!".

866
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,377
Rym: But he didn't say how he knew him.

867
00:49:57,397 --> 00:49:59,014
Rym: He made it obvious that he knew him.

868
00:49:59,035 --> 00:50:01,197
Scott: Well, he saw the picture and he said, "Ox Beyer!

869
00:50:01,217 --> 00:50:01,822
Scott: I know

870
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:02,104
Scott: him!".

871
00:50:02,306 --> 00:50:03,897
Rym: But he didn't say how or why.

872
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:04,763
Rym: He's just like, "I know this

873
00:50:04,783 --> 00:50:05,024
Rym: dude!".

874
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:09,839
Rym: So now, Ox Beyer's got a gun, and Master Keaton's standing there with his sling.

875
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:13,576
Rym: And Ox Beyer just reaches for the gun, aims up, and fires.

876
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,970
Rym: And it cuts to Master Keaton, and he's just standing there.

877
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,909
Rym: He doesn't even flinch, and the bullet misses him.

878
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:20,408
Rym: It barely misses him.

879
00:50:20,991 --> 00:50:24,304
Rym: And then he flings the rock and takes the Ox Beyer guy out.

880
00:50:24,628 --> 00:50:27,274
Rym: Then he walks over with a badass look on his face.

881
00:50:27,295 --> 00:50:33,209
Rym: He's standing over him, and he says, like, the guy's whole name, blah blah blah, Ox Beyer.

882
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:37,409
Rym: And then you have this flashback of Ox Beyer is like, "Huh?

883
00:50:38,131 --> 00:50:38,759
Scott: I know you

884
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,145
Scott: now!".

885
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:39,814
Scott: "You're the

886
00:50:39,935 --> 00:50:40,482
Scott: master!".

887
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:41,473
Scott: "The

888
00:50:41,815 --> 00:50:42,460
Scott: master!".

889
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:45,790
Rym: It cuts to SAS Survival Training.

890
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:49,890
Rym: That is the German equivalent of the SWAT team times a million.

891
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:55,140
Scott: I thought, no, I thought the SAS was the special air service.

892
00:50:56,072 --> 00:50:57,049
Rym: All the Counter-Strike names.

893
00:50:57,756 --> 00:50:59,270
Rym: The SAS are badasses.

894
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:00,440
Scott: They're badasses.

895
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:04,221
Rym: And it cuts to this flashback of Ox Beyer going through Survival Training, and he's copying out.

896
00:51:04,282 --> 00:51:08,263
Scott: And, you know, it's the typical walking through the mud with a very heavy backpack.

897
00:51:08,688 --> 00:51:10,122
Rym: And he's failing.

898
00:51:10,162 --> 00:51:10,970
Rym: Like, he's falling over.

899
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:15,818
Scott: Yeah, like, Ox Beyer's walking in the dark with, in the mud, heavy backpack, and he falls over tired.

900
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:23,838
Scott: And then you see Master Keaton standing there with the same heavy backpack, completely unphased and untired, going like, "Eh, get up.

901
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,222
Scott: We'll

902
00:51:24,242 --> 00:51:24,364
Scott: see.".

903
00:51:25,071 --> 00:51:28,850
Rym: Yeah, and it's apparent that Master Keaton is in fact the instructor.

904
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,424
Scott: And not, he wasn't in training with Ox Beyer.

905
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:35,129
Scott: He was TRAINING Ox Beyer.

906
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:44,504
Rym: And then he says very clearly, like, "If you'd remembered your lessons, firearms are not as useful as an improvised sling weapon in windy

907
00:51:44,585 --> 00:51:45,069
Rym: climates.".

908
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,209
Scott: Yeah, heavy rock won't get blown around by the wind, but a bullet will.

909
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:51,129
Rym: And then Ox Beyer's like, "Ah, son of a bitch.

910
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:51,975
Scott: You're the

911
00:51:52,016 --> 00:51:52,541
Scott: master.".

912
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:55,190
Rym: And that's pretty much the first episode.

913
00:51:55,390 --> 00:52:00,058
Rym: And actually, we really explained all the stuff we needed to explain without actually ruining the plot.

914
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:05,649
Scott: Yeah, because the second and third episodes, which are the only ones we've watched, had the same formula.

915
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,050
Scott: There's a situation involving insurance somehow.

916
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,138
Scott: They send Master Keaton to take care of it.

917
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:13,510
Scott: He's the master.

918
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:14,867
Scott: The end.

919
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,541
Scott: But it's awesome because you see how he does it each time.

920
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:21,230
Rym: Yep, and it's very realistic in most cases.

921
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:22,647
Scott: And it's also very varied.

922
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:27,025
Scott: It's not always a similar case, you know, where like, "Oh, some guys are troubling a

923
00:52:27,065 --> 00:52:27,328
Scott: woman.".

924
00:52:27,752 --> 00:52:31,529
Scott: It's all sorts of different cases involving different insurances on things.

925
00:52:32,434 --> 00:52:33,939
Scott: And it can get pretty crazy.

926
00:52:33,959 --> 00:52:40,017
Rym: And also, for the first three episodes at least, they keep dropping little hints into, like, Master Keaton's life.

927
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:42,037
Rym: And bit by bit, we learn more and more about him.

928
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:44,159
Scott: And how masterful he is.

929
00:52:44,179 --> 00:52:44,241
Scott: Yep.

930
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:48,826
Rym: Like, there's a point where one guy in the second episode we watched, right?

931
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:49,472
Rym: Yeah, the second one.

932
00:52:49,735 --> 00:52:52,199
Rym: Where they, Master Keaton's doing all this badass stuff.

933
00:52:52,259 --> 00:52:53,815
Rym: So the guy's like, "Do a background check on this

934
00:52:53,855 --> 00:52:54,118
Rym: guy.".

935
00:52:54,663 --> 00:52:58,159
Rym: Then at the end of the end, like near the end of the episode, they're reading the background check.

936
00:52:58,179 --> 00:52:59,028
Rym: And they're like, "Whoa!

937
00:52:59,311 --> 00:52:59,715
Rym: This guy's a

938
00:52:59,755 --> 00:53:00,422
Rym: badass!".

939
00:53:00,502 --> 00:53:04,724
Scott: Yeah, 'cause in that episode, they kept talking about who was the professional and who was the amateur.

940
00:53:04,744 --> 00:53:07,956
Scott: And they were like, "Uh, at the end, they were finally like, we were the amateur.

941
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:09,350
Scott: He was the professional.

942
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:10,395
Rym: Ah."

943
00:53:10,456 --> 00:53:10,659
Rym: Yep.

944
00:53:10,882 --> 00:53:12,885
Rym: But don't think that this show is cliched at all.

945
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:14,399
Rym: This show is really kinda unique.

946
00:53:14,661 --> 00:53:18,320
Rym: In that it's episodic and it's, I would liken it a little bit to Lupin.

947
00:53:18,603 --> 00:53:25,229
Scott: Both in the style and just in how much- It just doesn't- It's like Lupin without goofiness if Lupin was on the side of good.

948
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:25,310
Rym: Yep.

949
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,543
Rym: Like, take Golgo 13, which is just badass dude killing people.

950
00:53:28,563 --> 00:53:33,310
Scott: And take out like, the hardcore sex and the incredible violence.

951
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:33,652
Rym: Yep.

952
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:38,970
Rym: Then take Lupin and take out the silliness and mash them together and at Indiana Jones and terrorists.

953
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:39,793
Scott: Yeah.

954
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:41,109
Rym: That's what Master Keaton is.

955
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:44,768
Scott: It's like if Indiana Jones is just a friendly guy and not a greedy dude.

956
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:51,263
Rym: Also, aside from the actual show itself, which one I love, but the animation's pretty good.

957
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:52,394
Rym: Especially for when it was made.

958
00:53:52,516 --> 00:53:56,390
Scott: Yeah, I think it's not the greatest, but it fits what's going on.

959
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:57,462
Rym: It's definitely passable.

960
00:53:57,563 --> 00:53:58,150
Rym: It's typical.

961
00:53:58,772 --> 00:54:01,309
Rym: I really like the music except for the closing song.

962
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:07,303
Rym: The closing song is just kind of like pop-ish crap, but the rest of the music is just very good and atmospheric.

963
00:54:07,586 --> 00:54:10,636
Scott: I just don't really notice the music, you know, going on so much.

964
00:54:10,717 --> 00:54:16,010
Scott: Like, you know, there's some animes that have like a soundtrack that stands out like a sore thumb.

965
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,465
Rym: Like a noir.

966
00:54:17,607 --> 00:54:18,596
Scott: Or like hack sign.

967
00:54:18,657 --> 00:54:19,101
Scott: Yeah.

968
00:54:19,444 --> 00:54:21,243
Scott: But this show is just one of those...

969
00:54:21,263 --> 00:54:28,475
Rym: In fact, I would submit that hack sign wasn't worth watching except for the fact, like, it was a mediocre show.

970
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:31,427
Rym: The music alone pushed it above the mediocre line.

971
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:31,770
Scott: It's true.

972
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:32,561
Scott: In my opinion.

973
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:39,342
Scott: It's true, but no, in Master Keaton, the music is sort of an instrumental atmospheric background music.

974
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:40,495
Scott: It doesn't stand out.

975
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:41,730
Scott: I don't really notice it.

976
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,529
Scott: In fact, I couldn't think of any of the songs in my head or sing any of them in my head right now.

977
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:46,884
Rym: See, I can remember just that.

978
00:54:46,965 --> 00:54:50,436
Rym: it really doesn't stand out, but it's really good and I like it.

979
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:51,610
Rym: It's the kind of music that I like.

980
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,699
Scott: I just don't even notice it.

981
00:54:52,962 --> 00:54:54,835
Scott: It's so... I don't know.

982
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,405
Rym: And also, the opener has a good song.

983
00:54:57,506 --> 00:55:04,740
Rym: And the opener itself is... It's not like revolutionary or anything, but it is atypical of a lot of the shows from that era.

984
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:09,249
Rym: It's not just the fast cuts to action, fast cuts to action J-pop song.

985
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:19,629
Rym: It's very much a good song and just kind of this not really epic, but very atmospheric almost moving thing that ends with a very poetic scene.

986
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:22,177
Scott: Eh, it's just an opener.

987
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,126
Scott: It's not really a special... I wouldn't put it on the list of best openers or the list of worst openers.

988
00:55:27,227 --> 00:55:29,428
Scott: It's just... It seems standard to me.

989
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:30,679
Rym: I liked it.

990
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,460
Rym: I would put it a little bit above the pack.

991
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:38,825
Rym: Because remember, in that era, most shows... Of course, even today, most shows... Well, now it's J-rock instead of J-pop.

992
00:55:39,189 --> 00:55:42,401
Rym: But most shows back then were generic J-pop.

993
00:55:42,623 --> 00:55:44,470
Rym: Often, it was Megumi Hayashibara.

994
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:47,634
Rym: And just a bunch of cuts from the show.

995
00:55:47,654 --> 00:55:50,869
Scott: I don't know what era you think Master Keaton is from.

996
00:55:52,476 --> 00:55:53,070
Rym: Very broadly.

997
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,555
Rym: I'm thinking '90s.

998
00:55:56,274 --> 00:55:58,157
Scott: Let's go actually find out where it was from.

999
00:55:58,238 --> 00:55:59,978
Rym: Yeah, what year was Master Keaton actually made?

1000
00:55:59,998 --> 00:56:00,769
Scott: I'm almost there.

1001
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,410
Rym: Alright, I'm not gonna edit this out, so I'll just keep talking.

1002
00:56:05,414 --> 00:56:08,669
Rym: We found Master Keaton mostly because Anime World Order yelled at us to watch it.

1003
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:09,115
Scott: '98 and '99.

1004
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,864
Rym: Wow, it's a lot later than I expected.

1005
00:56:11,965 --> 00:56:15,929
Scott: Yeah, I thought this was gonna be a much earlier show, but actually it's a very recent show.

1006
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:26,390
Scott: It's actually kind of weird because then that means that it was using sort of an older anime style in a later time.

1007
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,965
Rym: Yeah, because I really would have pegged it for a lot earlier than that.

1008
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:31,076
Rym: Like, five or six years.

1009
00:56:31,197 --> 00:56:32,470
Scott: Yeah, this thing has an opener.

1010
00:56:32,571 --> 00:56:36,710
Scott: that's sort of like a '70s, '80s style.

1011
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,045
Scott: may even, you know?

1012
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:39,601
Rym: Yeah, disregard all my J-pop stuff then.

1013
00:56:39,824 --> 00:56:42,450
Scott: Or like a late '80s, you know, those kind of shows.

1014
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:46,350
Scott: But no, actually it's a much later show using a sort of an old style.

1015
00:56:47,052 --> 00:56:48,490
Rym: I guess I really like that.

1016
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:53,868
Rym: I mean, it seems like a lot of shows will go with whatever the prevailing style of the times is.

1017
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:55,328
Rym: Usually crap shows.

1018
00:56:56,392 --> 00:56:58,550
Rym: But this show really seems to buck that trend.

1019
00:56:59,090 --> 00:56:59,176
Scott: Yeah.

1020
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,649
Rym: All in all, it's an excellent show.

1021
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,990
Rym: You can get it pretty cheap, I imagine.

1022
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:07,130
Rym: You can get it on Netflix easily.

1023
00:57:08,031 --> 00:57:10,176
Rym: I highly, highly recommend it.

1024
00:57:10,216 --> 00:57:11,489
Rym: from the three episodes I've seen.

1025
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:12,900
Scott: Here's something.

1026
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:19,917
Scott: The guy who directed Monster, the TV shit, the anime, also directed Master Keaton.

1027
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:25,110
Scott: And also directed some movie that I never heard of, and whatever.

1028
00:57:25,731 --> 00:57:29,589
Rym: See, I can kind of see that, but then again, I didn't like Monster, the anime, at all.

1029
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:31,110
Scott: Yeah, who knows.

1030
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:32,079
Rym: Well, now I'll qualify that.

1031
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,609
Rym: I liked Monster until it just got so implausible I couldn't deal with it.

1032
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:37,896
Rym: Kind of like Noir.

1033
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:40,403
Rym: Noir started out so awesome.

1034
00:57:40,788 --> 00:57:42,949
Rym: Like, this is gonna be an awesome show.

1035
00:57:43,411 --> 00:57:47,650
Rym: And in the course of five more episodes, it turned into, like, the crappiest show I was watching.

1036
00:57:50,311 --> 00:57:52,829
Scott: Anyways, yeah, that's Master Keaton right there.

1037
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:53,734
Rym: Yeah.

1038
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:57,374
Scott: Definitely the five dollars per DVD is worth it.

1039
00:57:57,656 --> 00:58:09,150
Scott: And later in the series, you know, it definitely, like, I can tell from looking at the back of the DVD cases that plot, some sort of longer plot develops and is concluded in the final episode.

1040
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:13,859
Scott: And you'll get, like, some three part stories, maybe even a five part story.

1041
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,789
Scott: I don't even, I don't even know.

1042
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:15,838
Scott: I have to go look, but.

1043
00:58:16,181 --> 00:58:16,343
Rym: Yep.

1044
00:58:16,646 --> 00:58:17,898
Rym: Now, we'll cover the show again.

1045
00:58:17,979 --> 00:58:21,129
Rym: Once we've seen all of it, we'll do our typical GeekNights final thoughts.

1046
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:27,959
Rym: So if anyone wants to listen to that and is interested in the show, I'd recommend in the next couple months watching all of Master Keaton.

1047
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:30,605
Rym: I say couple months because it's gonna take us a while.

1048
00:58:30,646 --> 00:58:36,330
Rym: We're watching a whole bunch of shows, and we have lives, and we have podcasts, and we have conventions.

1049
00:58:37,212 --> 00:58:38,410
Scott: And this weekend we have a convention.

1050
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:40,810
Rym: Yep, and we're done with Master Keaton.

1051
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:45,820
Rym: But also, this weekend, we will be at ConnectiCon for in the very least Saturday.

1052
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:45,901
Rym: Yep.

1053
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:52,830
Rym: If you want to see us go, we're not doing anything official because I never bothered to talk to the ConnectiCon people, but we'll be there interviewing.

1054
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,510
Scott: ConnectiCon is in Hartford, is in or near Hartford, Connecticut.

1055
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,850
Scott: I think in the Connecticut Convention Center, I could be wrong.

1056
00:59:00,132 --> 00:59:04,908
Scott: Just go to, just search for ConnectiCon on the Google, and you'll find it.

1057
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:05,592
Rym: Yep.

1058
00:59:06,058 --> 00:59:08,670
Scott: But it is a big webcomic convention.

1059
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,637
Rym: Yeah, if you like webcomics, well one, go to the Mocha Art Festival.

1060
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:13,395
Rym: But two, go to ConnectiCon.

1061
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:22,359
Rym: One, if you are a webcomic artist, the barrier to entry of being a guest or a panelist there as a webcomic artist is ludicrously low.

1062
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:26,710
Rym: You can just go, they are so open and awesome to the webcomic community.

1063
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:27,842
Rym: It's really kind of a cool thing.

1064
00:59:28,287 --> 00:59:28,490
Scott: Yep.

1065
00:59:29,492 --> 00:59:36,544
Scott: And, you know, a lot of webcomic people from wide, far away places come to ConnectiCon.

1066
00:59:36,564 --> 00:59:37,130
Scott: Like, the guy who does.

1067
00:59:37,231 --> 00:59:39,616
Scott: real life comics comes all the way from the west coast.

1068
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,262
Scott: Yeah.

1069
00:59:40,362 --> 00:59:42,524
Scott: And Brian Clevenger comes, who does 8-Bit Theater.

1070
00:59:42,544 --> 00:59:43,675
Scott: I don't know, isn't he from Florida?

1071
00:59:43,695 --> 00:59:45,434
Rym: I don't remember, but he's an awesome dude.

1072
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:47,984
Rym: He was at UberCon last year, two years ago.

1073
00:59:48,105 --> 00:59:49,096
Scott: Yeah, he's gonna be there.

1074
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:51,075
Scott: All kinds of webcomic people.

1075
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:52,915
Scott: Most of them I don't read, but I know they're cool.

1076
00:59:52,935 --> 00:59:54,148
Rym: Yeah, I read a lot of them.

1077
00:59:54,168 --> 00:59:56,410
Scott: Or they're cool people at least, whether I like their comics or not.

1078
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:59,460
Rym: Though, I gotta say, uh, real life, I got some words.

1079
00:59:59,703 --> 01:00:02,049
Scott: Yeah, well, we'll give him what for.

1080
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:05,870
Rym: Yeah, real life was one of my favorite comics, and now I don't even really read it anymore.

1081
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:12,895
Scott: I still read it, but it's sort of out of habit, and it just takes me about a year to stop reading a comic out of habit once it's bad.

1082
01:00:12,915 --> 01:00:17,217
Rym: Oh god, we read the bad boys of computer science for months after the website was gone.

1083
01:00:17,237 --> 01:00:18,813
Scott: When it was a 404, we read it.

1084
01:00:18,995 --> 01:00:22,813
Rym: I would just click on it every day, and then That's how good your comic is.

1085
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:28,207
Scott: If you can make a comic that's really good, you can tell how good it is by stop updating.

1086
01:00:28,268 --> 01:00:30,814
Scott: Don't do anything and see how long I keep visiting.

1087
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:36,169
Rym: Well, case in point, Emily did a webcomic a long time ago, like a short one, and she just kind of stopped doing it.

1088
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,875
Rym: And she still has fans, like, bothering her about it.

1089
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:42,470
Rym: Our friend Ido did a really, really popular webcomic.

1090
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,733
Rym: Well, I say did, but she hasn't stopped it.

1091
01:00:44,773 --> 01:00:46,067
Rym: She just hasn't updated it in a long time.

1092
01:00:46,871 --> 01:00:50,833
Rym: And she has a lot of fans that are rapid and follow her around and bother her.

1093
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,861
Scott: Like, imagine if Penny Arcade stopped updating.

1094
01:00:54,205 --> 01:00:54,690
Scott: You know what?

1095
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:57,864
Scott: I would be checking Penny Arcade daily for years to come.

1096
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:58,330
Rym: You know what?

1097
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:01,560
Rym: Hacks would probably still happen, even if Gabe and Tycho were dead.

1098
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,812
Rym: Haha, it's true.

1099
01:01:03,115 --> 01:01:06,550
Rym: I can see it's just happening, and then people wouldn't even realize they were gone.

1100
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,944
Rym: They just wouldn't even think about it.

1101
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:10,230
Scott: Speaking of which, I didn't read Penny Arcade today.

1102
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:12,710
Rym: Uh, uh, you'll read it.

1103
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:13,609
Rym: I'm not going to say anything.

1104
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:14,937
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

1105
01:01:15,683 --> 01:01:17,770
Rym: But suffice to say, Master Keaton is awesome.

1106
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:19,309
Rym: We will be at ConnectiCon.

1107
01:01:22,651 --> 01:01:23,428
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

1108
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:31,770
Rym: And, uh, also unrelated, get us your jury nullification feedback.

1109
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,369
Rym: Some Thursday coming up, we'll do a show on it.

1110
01:01:34,993 --> 01:01:35,970
Rym: We'll try to get some guests.

1111
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:44,668
Rym: I think this will be our first well-researched with feedback from listeners show, as opposed to our "we rant about something for an hour" shows.

1112
01:01:46,171 --> 01:01:48,075
Scott: Oh man, this is a great comic.

1113
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,854
Scott: Haha, I guess.

1114
01:01:50,522 --> 01:01:51,250
Rym: Alright, we're done.

1115
01:01:51,653 --> 01:01:52,410
Rym: We'll see you tomorrow.

1116
01:02:00,372 --> 01:02:02,493
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1117
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:05,181
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

1118
01:02:05,585 --> 01:02:09,909
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

1119
01:02:10,617 --> 01:02:13,085
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

1120
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:13,914
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com and if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

1122
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,096
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight Monday through Thursday.

1123
01:02:28,702 --> 01:02:31,954
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

1124
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:35,788
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
