1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,888
Rym: It's Wednesday February 14th.

2
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:12,610
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:14,838
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,431
Rym: tonight We talk about what we like in an anime convention.

5
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:20,439
Scott: It's a total cop-out.

6
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,717
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:29,600
Rym: Well we just spent the last hour digging our cars out of our driveway.

8
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:33,800
Scott: Yeah, the snow finally stopped, and I happen to notice as soon as it happened.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,780
Scott: I just looked out because I've been looking out the window like every hour You know and I'm like whoa no snow, so he ran outside.

10
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:47,107
Scott: I was wearing two pairs of pants and zero underwears when I ran outside and Unshoveled the car.

11
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:59,740
Rym: see now very serendipitously Emily had helped me rearrange one of my closets that she could store a bunch of stuff in it temporarily and During all of that we pulled out two giant cardboard boxes full of as far as I can tell garbage.

12
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:12,900
Rym: however however now that I had to go outside and shovel a foot of snow off of my car and off the driveway and Realize that in one of those boxes was none other than my ski pants that I have not worn since the last time I went skiing

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,026
Scott: Wow, that's that's a long time.

14
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:17,029
Scott: It's like a decade.

15
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:20,100
Scott: I put on my boots that I didn't wear at all this year.

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,573
Scott: I haven't worn them since last year and last year.

17
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:23,779
Scott: I only warm a few times.

18
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:36,577
Scott: I'll probably buy new ones the next time like if it snows before like in December next year I'll buy new ones, but yeah boots crazy, so we two pants now.

19
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:43,996
Rym: the best part is we spent You know all this time digging out the car so that we could then Walk to the Chinese place right next to our house to get some Chinese food.

20
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,072
Scott: yep And it's good though because now we don't have to shovel the cars out.

21
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:52,513
Scott: tomorrow morning when we have to go to a convention We'll just be able to throw our shit in the car and go.

22
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:57,778
Rym: yeah speaking of which This weekend we're going to be in Washington DC at the Omni Shore Motel.

23
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:04,600
Rym: start Yeah, we'll be there like tomorrow night Thursday night for Katsucon one of our at least one of my favorite anime convention.

24
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:10,560
Rym: Scott's never been to it before so we can't say it's his favorite yet, but no I'm pretty sure it's gonna be a good convention.

25
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,900
Scott: It's one of the top ten conventions in the United States in terms of attendance.

26
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,620
Rym: Yeah, at least anime conventions and the previous two years have been great.

27
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:21,454
Scott: Yeah, and we're going and we're gonna do a bunch of awesome stuff there.

28
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:36,100
Rym: Yep, and if nothing else We're doing our famous anime match game Which if any of you went to sita khan which there weren't many of you there, then you've seen most of the questions I'm gonna ask because I'm lazy, but I'm gonna reuse most of them because it's a tone.

29
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,574
Scott: Yeah, so few people who were at sita khan will also be at Katsucon.

30
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,102
Scott: Let's see you me Corbin.

31
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:43,326
Rym: yeah, so great.

32
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:44,851
Rym: I'll send the con chair of sita khan.

33
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:47,600
Scott: Yeah, so yeah, we can reuse the same question.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,022
Scott: You know what?

35
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:52,258
Rym: Corbin wasn't actually there for all of the match game because he had khan business to attend.

36
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,336
Scott: ha ha awesome.

37
00:02:55,701 --> 00:03:01,746
Rym: However, this will put us in a bind because if oda khan asks us to do the anime match game Then we're gonna have to come up with all new material.

38
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:07,382
Scott: I have to write new material which is oda khan and Katsucon have the same Attendees mostly.

39
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:13,420
Rym: there's also the problem that I haven't written new material for this since pretty much the second time we ran it.

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,059
Scott: Well, I just came up with a new one like a few minutes ago.

41
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,094
Rym: Yeah, mostly to make fun of one of our celebrity panelists.

42
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:20,220
Scott: Well, you know what?

43
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:24,960
Scott: If people want to help us write the anime match game of the future.

44
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:28,797
Scott: All you got to do is make a little thread on the forums and you have to say stuff like.

45
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:33,018
Scott: I mean a lot of These we've covered but it's got to be stuff like a funny anime.

46
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:36,897
Rym: Yeah, you see scary and I write all the flavor text.

47
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:37,560
Rym: We don't need that.

48
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,185
Rym: I could write flavor text all day long.

49
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:43,478
Rym: what we need are the actual distill down questions like name.

50
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:44,842
Rym: a sad Anime.

51
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:46,808
Rym: an anime that made you cry.

52
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:49,717
Rym: an anime that fucked with your head an anime.

53
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:50,600
Rym: That was bad.

54
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:53,120
Scott: Yeah, I just came up with on a few minutes ago was an anime.

55
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,115
Rym: No one can pronounce the name of ha ha way to reveal our one trump card.

56
00:03:58,236 --> 00:03:58,857
Scott: I know right?

57
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:05,180
Rym: Yeah, luckily I don't think any rit anime people will be at Katsucon either so we can get away with totally reusing old material.

58
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:05,864
Scott: Yep.

59
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:06,650
Rym: All right.

60
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:08,240
Rym: Yeah, but Katsucon is gonna be great.

61
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,175
Rym: Check us out in the video game room where we will be guests.

62
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:14,754
Rym: slash staff 24/7 give or take for the entire con.

63
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:16,716
Scott: Oh, this is gonna be great.

64
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:18,380
Scott: Also, I need to go to sleep.

65
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,021
Rym: There's a good chance if you're there tomorrow night, you'll see us in the lobby playing German board games Or DS.

66
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:31,442
Rym: Yeah, or just talking something like that, you know talking the thing we do every day a lot Right.

67
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:39,439
Rym: So in the news, I just want to bring this up not so much because it's happening again But because I don't think a lot of anime fans really know about this.

68
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:48,700
Rym: But Japan one of their primary exports to the world is Culture and entertainment and it's not like this is just some way it is.

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:58,219
Rym: But it's actually the fact that the Japanese government works very hard to make this reality Promotes this sort of thing and it's definitely part of Japan's kind of grand plan.

70
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:03,480
Scott: I mean think about Japan is a little tiny island, you know, and they mostly buy stuff from other people.

71
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,799
Scott: Well, they got to give stuff, you know somehow to give away or else economics don't work.

72
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:14,130
Scott: So the only stuff they really have to give away is Brains, you know things that they can do with their brains.

73
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,716
Scott: They design awesome stuff.

74
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,060
Scott: They invent awesome stuff.

75
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,640
Scott: They make really efficient factories.

76
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,920
Scott: So they buy raw materials and then put stuff together and sell that and they also create arts and entertainment.

77
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:36,320
Rym: So on February 9th, the Japanese government announced their second five-year plan For the promotion of Japanese culture as I have just stolen almost verbatim from the anime news network.

78
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:39,951
Scott: Yep, the I guess the other five-year plan it just finished.

79
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:42,439
Rym: Well, we know how well five-year plans tend to go.

80
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,651
Rym: Lol, I just I don't really have much to say about this other than that one.

81
00:05:48,691 --> 00:06:08,931
Rym: It's smart on Japan's part - Part of this seems to come out of the fact that anime and manga have as far as Japan can tell or is concerned It's doing really well in America and in other parts of the world and they realize that Exporting it is a good thing and they want to increase this or possibly With other aspects of Japanese pop culture.

82
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,060
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you think about it this way, right?

83
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Scott: Japan is just one country pretty, you know, it's an important country in the world.

84
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:20,660
Scott: It's Western and modern and has a lot of people but it's not very big.

85
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,820
Scott: It's not more important than France or Britain or any of those other countries.

86
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,025
Rym: Well, I don't know.

87
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:28,901
Rym: you could argue about France maybe in the last 10 to 15 years Yeah,

88
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:42,319
Scott: but I mean if you look at the mind share that Japan has worldwide, you know in terms of arts and entertainment and culture It seems a lot bigger, especially in geek type communities than like say Spain

89
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:42,640
Rym: God.

90
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:50,180
Rym: Well, look at us, you know me and Scott I'd say that a good 60 to 70 percent of our total entertainment comes from Japan.

91
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:52,226
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

92
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:59,252
Scott: So obviously their five-year plans are working and if other countries were smart they would Copy what Japan is doing.

93
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:05,060
Scott: I mean, you know France makes a lot of art Italy makes a lot of art Greece makes art.

94
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:06,890
Scott: How come they don't export that stuff?

95
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:17,244
Rym: now the question just becomes is Japanese pop culture doing so well in the world because they're working to promote it or is it because of some inherent aspect of Japanese pop culture?

96
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:20,778
Scott: that is a good question that I do not know the answer to.

97
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:26,100
Rym: yes And I hope that we will get some interesting feedback about that in the forums because I don't really know.

98
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:31,113
Scott: I think we need to talk to someone who's very smart and knows the answer already.

99
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:33,300
Rym: Yes, and hopefully no one who will beg the question.

100
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:37,469
Scott: Oh Anyway All right.

101
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,505
Scott: I got two Anime iTunes related news's.

102
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:48,457
Scott: first of all and a US anime company has made a little store on iTunes, can you guess what company it is?

103
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:50,303
Rym: Not really.

104
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:50,504
Rym: No.

105
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:54,640
Scott: Well, I thought it was gonna be Viz because Viz has those rights to Death Note.

106
00:07:54,861 --> 00:08:00,140
Scott: Yeah, so it makes sense for Viz to open up a store on iTunes and start selling anime, but it's not Viz.

107
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:02,733
Scott: No, it's not it's it's Funimation.

108
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:03,597
Rym: Funimation.

109
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:11,693
Scott: you say yep If you go on iTunes in the United States iTunes store Remember you can change what iTunes store you're in by going to the bottom and choosing a country.

110
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:20,660
Scott: you can buy all 24 episodes of desert punk all 26 episodes of samurai 7 and 20 out of 24 episodes of speedgrapher.

111
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,670
Scott: I guess the final four episodes of speedgrapher aren't out yet.

112
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:26,460
Scott: All three of these are gonzo shows great.

113
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:30,780
Rym: Yeah, well no that's fine cuz you don't need to buy the end just buy the first two and stop.

114
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,400
Scott: Well, I guess when the final speedgrapher DVD comes out, I assume those four episodes will go up on iTunes.

115
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,004
Scott: They're all you know.

116
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:45,004
Scott: in the standard iPod video h.264 format I assume they look pretty good because it's not hard to make Anime look good.

117
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:49,420
Scott: and you know digital video formats if you know how to set all the encoding options properly.

118
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:53,520
Scott: But one interesting thing is you know, this is Funimation.

119
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:57,080
Scott: They operate pretty much in the US in terms of distributing anime.

120
00:08:57,822 --> 00:09:02,357
Scott: So unless you have a United States billing address, you can't actually buy any of this stuff.

121
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,160
Rym: great.

122
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:07,779
Scott: And also, you know, it's got the usual Apple DRM encumbrings double great.

123
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:14,850
Rym: Yeah, maybe it's just me but in terms of how I consume anime and acquire anime in general There are only two ways.

124
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:21,800
Rym: I want to get it either I want it as it's coming out in Japan in which case I would pay for that But I can't pay for that.

125
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,385
Rym: So I watch the fan subs instead.

126
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:31,900
Rym: and then if I didn't want to watch it as it came out episode by episode I don't really care when I see it and I'll just get the DVDs from Netflix.

127
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:41,768
Scott: Yeah, if I don't if I'm not watching a show as it comes out in Japan, you know with subtitles exactly as it is I want to watch the whole thing at once.

128
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:44,720
Scott: I want the whole thing real quick like in a box set.

129
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,471
Scott: I don't want to get one DVD at a time every month or two.

130
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:53,979
Scott: Yeah, it's either got to be an episode a week Or it's got to be the whole show for Netflix or in a box set.

131
00:09:54,019 --> 00:10:03,080
Rym: God I remember back in high school, but our D&D group, you know Ken was buying Escaflowne every month when it came out and every time we said let's watch one episode a week.

132
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:10,603
Rym: That way we'll finish it and then the next week the next tape will come out and we won't have these binges and then these Horrible withdrawals.

133
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:21,359
Rym: Yeah, and every beginning of the month we'd watch the first episode we'd sit there We'd pause it like alright We're gonna stop watching and then we'd unpause it and watch the rest of the tape.

134
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:26,480
Scott: That reminds me of the time when I bought the Matt cross box set and then I watched one episode every day.

135
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:27,524
Scott: That was good times.

136
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:30,719
Rym: I remember that because I come home and I'd watch about half of them with you.

137
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:33,178
Rym: Yeah, I watched all my favorite episodes at least.

138
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:37,334
Scott: Yeah, anyway, I got another iTunes related anime news.

139
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:38,820
Scott: It's sort of a combo news, right?

140
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:49,480
Scott: Apparently the big-time pros are gonna come down and compete with the likes of you and me and Anime world order and Dave and Joel and all those other anime podcasters.

141
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:57,552
Scott: There's going to be a new anime Podcast video show called anime TV.

142

Scott: Well, it doesn't it.

Scott: The only thing it says is that Johnny Young Bosch is the host.

Scott: Ah It is produced by bang zoom entertainment who I've never heard of and it has actual sponsors.

Scott: you ready for the sponsors?

Scott: The sponsors are as follows glyco Wait, wait, wait, wait, right.

Rym: All right, that's good.

168
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:05,890
Rym: I like that stuff Sacco.

169
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:06,392
Scott: What the hell.

170
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:07,796
Scott: Sacco birdhouse.

171
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:09,020
Scott: I don't know birdhouse is either.

172
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:14,135
Scott: You can get a sneak peek of the set at some URL Whatever.

173
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:16,946
Scott: And their first show they're gonna review.

174
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:17,568
Scott: Hari.

175
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,972
Rym: All right, I don't know.

176
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:22,865
Rym: this has the all the trappings of Commercial products.

177
00:12:23,486 --> 00:12:30,512
Scott: is definitely feels like someone's trying to move into our game But they're gonna be at all pros.

178
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:32,400
Scott: styling and not a good job.

179
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:44,622
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I I'm not gonna disparage it cuz I've hung out with Johnny before and he's a cool guy Yeah, but I get the feeling that this is going to be a lot like g4 TV in terms of how relevant it is to that actual.

180
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:45,986
Scott: that's the feeling I'm getting.

181
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:52,787
Scott: it's like, you know, the way g4 TV reviews a video game is the way that This show is gonna review an anime.

182
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:55,517
Scott: I'm pretty sure I might even watch the first episode tomorrow.

183
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:56,260
Scott: I mean, it's free, right?

184
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,489
Scott: I just had to deal with these sponsors ads.

185
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,474
Rym: When are you gonna watch it?

186
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:00,560
Rym: We're gonna be at Katsu Kan.

187
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,951
Scott: Oh, I'll watch it when we get back from Katsu Kan.

188
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:04,400
Rym: Yeah, cuz we also have Monday off work.

189
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,004
Scott: It's not like.

190
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:06,292
Scott: it's a streaming video.

191
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:11,129
Scott: It's a. it's a video podcast Yeah, but yeah, that's gonna be on iTunes and everything.

192
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,593
Scott: So I figured a combo news.

193
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:14,779
Rym: Yeah, I'm curious to see what this will be.

194
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,277
Rym: I'm as leery of it as I tend to be leery of just about anything in the world.

195
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:21,040
Rym: So don't take that.

196
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean there is already an anime video podcast that I think is really good.

197
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,380
Scott: We're just anime podcast net which is I guess they pronounce it right pawn.

198
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:35,700
Scott: That's the way they pronounce their show but they they don't seem to make shows too often.

199
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:43,760
Scott: But like when there's a convention in the Northeast area They usually do video interviews with all the Japanese guests and then they put those up.

200
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:48,380
Scott: So I imagine maybe after Katsu Kan me if they're there, maybe they'll put up some shows or something.

201
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,328
Rym: Hey, maybe we'll get them on our show and interview him.

202
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:51,132
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

203
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:52,879
Rym: yeah, I mean, we'll have all our stuff set up.

204
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:54,225
Scott: They're pretty smart people.

205
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:58,180
Scott: what you know, it's considering they speak fluent Japanese to talk to these guests.

206
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:03,360
Scott: It's actually pretty cool because the video podcast they interview the Japanese guest in Japanese and they have subtitles.

207
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:09,200
Scott: Ooh, it's much better that way because whenever you interview a Japanese guest you have the translator there.

208
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,500
Scott: It's all annoying because it takes twice as long to hear the interview Because they say stuff in Japanese and then you hear the person in English afterwards.

209
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:24,669
Rym: No There's a very easy way around that and most podcasters who record stuff at cons and most press people who aren't professional Just don't do it that way because they don't know how whatever.

210
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:28,936
Rym: but if we interview any Japanese guests with the translator It might suck for us to do it.

211
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,520
Scott: But you take the Japanese person's voice and make it quiet and put the translators voice over it.

212
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,952
Rym: Yeah, you do the BBC thing or the NPR thing.

213
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:39,140
Scott: The thing is a lot of people don't do that, especially.

214
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:44,555
Scott: Yeah, I know that's why I remember I would listen to interviews from e3 with Nintendo people and you.

215
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:49,580
Scott: they would just give you a video of What went on in the interview room and you like ah this takes forever.

216
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:51,952
Rym: See, that's why we had GeekNights here.

217
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:52,876
Rym: wouldn't do that.

218
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:53,580
Scott: No, he wouldn't.

219
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:03,550
Rym: All right Things of the day.

220
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:08,463
Rym: OMG, so there's this show called balls of steel.

221
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,530
Rym: don't care where it came from or anything.

222
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:22,130
Rym: but they did this bit and this bit involves getting a bunch of people who are recognized experts in various fields and Tricking them into thinking that they're on a quiz show where they'll be quizzed about their expertise.

223
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:26,544
Scott: Oh, so that's like bringing me on a show and asking me about computer stuff.

224
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:27,427
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

225
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:35,268
Rym: and Now they got these experts on and they ask him a few softball questions like one guy was an expert on and Frank and You know that sort of thing.

226
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:37,919
Rym: so they asked the first few questions.

227
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:44,359
Rym: the guy gets him right obviously and then they ask a question and The guy answers obviously correctly.

228
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,596
Rym: and they the buzzer goes and they say sorry that was incorrect the correct answer was blah.

229
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:58,310
Rym: and they start off where they're only kind of slightly off and By the end they start doing just absolutely crazy like so stupidly wrong.

230
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,524
Rym: You want to cry a Rym?

231
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:06,770
Scott: Name a popular robot anime series directed by Hideaki Anno.

232
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:07,673
Rym: Oh, I don't know.

233
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:09,660
Rym: that would have to be a Shinseki Evangelion.

234
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:10,423
Scott: I'm sorry.

235
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:11,066
Scott: It's wrong.

236
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:14,175
Scott: It's actually Robot fighter.

237
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,863
Scott: go go go see now.

238
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:20,980
Rym: This is a lot like that except It's funny and the questions are well done.

239
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,490
Rym: Yeah, but no the end Frank guy starts getting a little perturbed.

240
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,193
Rym: It is just.

241
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:31,289
Rym: it's a good watch and that's really all I can say about it because I haven't even watched it.

242
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,410
Rym: I can't see anything because some of the times when they ask a question like you can see a situation where?

243
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:42,727
Rym: You know the answer to a question But you're not like because they said you're wrong and you're being recorded now.

244
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,876
Rym: You're thinking wait a minute Am I sure?

245
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:45,721
Rym: am I sure?

246
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,450
Rym: and it's almost like I might be worth it.

247
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,104
Rym: Just let it go because you don't want to look like a total tool.

248
00:16:50,164 --> 00:17:02,756
Scott: if I was in a game show I wouldn't call him on it right there, and then unless I was a hundred percent sure and If I you know and even if I wasn't a hundred percent sure I would go and look it up immediately after the show And then call him on it

249
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:08,602
Rym: though when I was in quiz bowl in high school And you know the varsity quiz bowl team which I got a letter for.

250
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:10,888
Rym: that says a lot about how my high school was.

251
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:15,867
Rym: yeah But a lot of times quiz bowl because they're just run by college punks.

252
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:24,308
Rym: usually They'd have just incorrect questions Or they'd screw something up, and we would call him on it immediately loudly even if we weren't sure.

253
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:29,690
Rym: sometimes We'd challenge things where we had no idea what the answer was just to win on a technicality.

254
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:39,329
Scott: Well there is an advantage in that real game shows at least the United States Are governed by so many laws that if they mess up you can totally get them.

255
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:49,309
Scott: Yeah It's like so if you get all the questions right on Jeopardy and Alex Trebek just keeps telling you you're wrong And you don't get any money on the show and at the end of the show they say sorry you lose.

256
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:54,543
Scott: if You actually were right then the game show authorities.

257
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,609
Scott: I guess will come and make sure you win.

258
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,075
Rym: Anyway, this is worth a watch.

259
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:02,427
Rym: So are you continuing your thing of the day theme week?

260
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:05,877
Scott: I am and Basically what I got here.

261
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:08,210
Scott: I went around that looked I found a bunch of videos.

262
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:11,790
Scott: I was because there was so much awesome jazz action on YouTube.

263
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:12,856
Scott: I didn't know which one to pick.

264
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:15,090
Rym: Did you find any videos of Buddy Rich drumming?

265
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:16,097
Scott: I didn't even try.

266
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:19,276
Rym: that's something on the side Totally outside of all this.

267
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:19,978
Rym: you ever get a chance.

268
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:21,584
Rym: try to find a video of Buddy Rich.

269
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:26,098
Rym: actually you know the drums Yeah, the hitting instruments.

270
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,448
Rym: No no cuz he does something cool anyway.

271
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,328
Scott: anyway What I found that was pretty cool.

272
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:54,729
Scott: if you remember my thing of the day for Monday the Dave Brubeck Quartet playing take 5. yeah, I can the ancient times I found another video of the Dave Brubeck Quartet playing take 5 in the 70s really in color and It's pretty cool to see the same guys only Way older playing the same exact thing.

273
00:18:55,693 --> 00:19:03,510
Rym: I had a friend who saw Maynard Ferguson playing when he was quite old Yeah, and frail old man could still really jam.

274
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:09,681
Scott: I actually read some stuff about the Dave Brubeck Quartet on the wikipedia's and That saxophone guy is dead.

275
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:18,803
Scott: he died like in the late 70s I think but Dave Brubeck is alive, and it's always been his quartet And I guess they still play in places, and they're pretty awesome.

276
00:19:19,164 --> 00:19:24,047
Rym: jazz musicians live forever Yeah, except that saxophone guy.

277
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,658
Scott: Obviously well, I think he might have died of smoking.

278
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:31,048
Rym: I'm not sure yeah, because jazz players never smoke or drink.

279
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:40,730
Rym: nah Yeah, yeah alright, so We kind of wanted to cop out so we could get this show done and pack up all the equipment for katsu kans.

280
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,241
Scott: Yeah, we're in a rush to do this show.

281
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:44,346
Scott: We don't really care about it.

282
00:19:44,386 --> 00:19:45,029
Scott: that much so.

283
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:50,087
Rym: Well also we you know we really want to review tank police dominion tank police.

284
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:51,112
Scott: we do We.

285
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:54,550
Rym: the only reason we put it off now is that like initial D or utana?

286
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,289
Rym: It's one of those shows that we don't want to do half acidly.

287
00:19:57,992 --> 00:20:10,760
Rym: And I have to get a lot of examples of the audio from the sub and the dub because the differences between them and The good things they did and the bad things they did are very important to the understanding of the wonderfulness That is dominion tank police.

288
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:12,089
Scott: that is too true.

289
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:18,989
Rym: I fucking love that anime, but anyway tonight since we're going to an anime con And we realized what I don't think we've ever actually talked about this.

290
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:20,557
Rym: Now we've talked about.

291
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:23,250
Rym: we did a whole series on how to go to anime cons.

292
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,190
Rym: We've talked about how to run anime cons.

293
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,217
Rym: We've talked about being guests at anime cons.

294
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:29,325
Rym: We've talked about how to do panels at anime cons.

295
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:30,630
Rym: We've reviewed anime cons.

296
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:36,409
Rym: We've never talked about what we personally like in anime cons like what we're actually looking for.

297
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:47,309
Scott: yeah Well, I think this show is gonna have quite a bit of overlap with the how to run anime cons Because when we tell you how to run an anime con we're basically gonna say hey do the stuff we like?

298
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:52,830
Scott: Yeah, yeah pretty much, but I do think there is you know definitely something.

299
00:20:53,372 --> 00:21:03,762
Scott: There's definitely not exactly the same show because there are things you have to do to run an anime con these days and make it Successful that we may not necessarily be fans of or care about yep.

300
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:13,126
Scott: in other words the perfect anime con That is designed only for Scott Reuben is Nothing like a successful anime con with 20,000 people at it.

301
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:20,188
Rym: Yeah So I don't expect anime con chairs to take what we are saying and try to turn that into a con.

302
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:21,896
Scott: because well No, please do that.

303
00:21:22,017 --> 00:21:23,365
Scott: It'll be the con just for me.

304
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:24,210
Scott: It'll be great.

305
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:33,129
Rym: It would basically be Rym aka hedonism bot surrounded by cadres of cat girls voice actors Yoko Kanno playing a piano.

306
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:39,270
Scott: Sounds good to me except replace the Rym with the Scott and the cat girls with the non cat girls.

307
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:46,309
Rym: see it'd be a lot like cinecon actually because you know that video game pianist and Entertainment system and the set the concert late at night.

308
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:52,930
Rym: Basically we were sitting like in the middle during the practice like it was a private concert for the two of us that we were.

309
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:55,157
Rym: Yeah, all right, but first.

310
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:59,130
Rym: I mean I guess the most important question is just why do we go to anime cons?

311
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,170
Scott: for fun The same reason we had to take the guest stage.

312
00:22:06,652 --> 00:22:08,939
Rym: No, I mean our first anime con ever.

313
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,329
Rym: we went for very different reasons than why we go to anime cons.

314
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:14,780
Rym: now We're in college we're freshmen.

315
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:18,192
Rym: we I mean we'd all we Freshman.

316
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:25,881
Rym: I didn't even fully grasp the concept of an anime can either and I remember our friend Luke one day It was like hey, let's all go to Ohio con.

317
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:26,423
Rym: Where is it?

318
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:30,659
Rym: We asked, Ohio He said and then like oh I get it.

319
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:32,526
Scott: Yeah, it's a pun.

320
00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:33,530
Rym: so we go to the website.

321
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,356
Rym: It lists like oh, they've got some guests.

322
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:38,124
Rym: They've got some events listed a video game room.

323
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:38,927
Rym: It's in a hotel.

324
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:43,284
Rym: It's in Ohio and I know we're really not sure what to expect.

325
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:44,470
Rym: I mean I'd been to gaming cons.

326
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:45,950
Rym: I've been going to gaming cons for a long time.

327
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,142
Scott: Yeah, I've been to a gaming con or two.

328
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:48,564
Scott: mostly.

329
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:49,690
Scott: I went to a magic tournament.

330
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,160
Scott: Yeah, yeah, pretty much just like a gaming con only with one game.

331
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:53,842
Rym: Yep.

332
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:56,330
Rym: We got we should do a Sean magic someday.

333
00:22:56,531 --> 00:23:01,154
Scott: Oh, God all that money money the way Magic the gathering.

334
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:02,037
Scott: no sorry it's money.

335
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:04,927
Rym: the wasting all right, so I knew what a gaming con was.

336
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:05,790
Rym: you go to play games.

337
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,618
Rym: I was like what at an anime con.

338
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,824
Rym: Do you go to watch anime?

339
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:09,668
Rym: that seems stupid.

340
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:10,070
Rym: yeah, man?

341
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,823
Scott: I could watch anime on my own or a gaming con.

342
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:14,370
Scott: you can see the purpose.

343
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:15,053
Scott: It's like aha.

344
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:17,705
Scott: I can't play this game unless there's someone else there.

345
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:23,069
Scott: playing with people I don't know is actually interesting as opposed to playing with people I play with every day now.

346
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:30,454
Rym: Then I could have seen the you know going to an anime con to watch anime because back then especially in high school a lot Of anime was hard to come by.

347
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:33,265
Scott: that is true, but you see yes, I did.

348
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:34,409
Scott: it's hard to come by.

349
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:36,556
Rym: yes Yeah, I didn't mean to like.

350
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:38,944
Rym: that was an unintentional poorly executed pun.

351
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:45,840
Scott: all right, so Let's just go to the con and forget this episode.

352
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:46,904
Rym: Let's power through.

353
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:56,246
Rym: we can do this all right, so Power through what I had something I was gonna say our back on track.

354
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:58,736
Rym: I'm not gonna edit this at all I'm just putting it up as it comes.

355
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,868
Rym: okay, but we were at RIT already.

356
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:06,525
Rym: Oh my God We were members of the biggest anime club in the country.

357
00:24:06,565 --> 00:24:11,726
Rym: they had every anime We could ever want to see in a library that we could check tapes out of for free.

358
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:12,630
Scott: that was true.

359
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:14,828
Rym: so you know like why should we go to this anime con?

360
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:23,930
Rym: and The the people who are older and wiser than us who were I'd lived a lot longer than us and seen a lot more anime Who were kind of spearheading our going to this con?

361
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,850
Rym: Kind of sat us down and explained what an anime con was and the way they explained it was basically all right.

362
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:45,118
Rym: so you go to a hotel and You're surrounded by nothing, but anime fans most of whom are Girls your age who are as geeky as you and are dressed up like cat girls and anime characters And I was like you know that's nice and all.

363
00:24:45,880 --> 00:25:02,010
Scott: it's obvious why that's nice, but I had been to many youth group conventions in my high school days, which is you know all sorts of Exactly your age girls and in a hotel for a whole weekend, so I was like been there done that what else he got for me?

364
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:09,716
Rym: Yeah, and then they basically said oh, yeah, and everyone gets laid at anime cons all the time not true Yeah, not the same thing.

365
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:11,201
Scott: They said about the youth group cons.

366
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:11,683
Scott: That's the same.

367
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:15,886
Scott: while there was much laying going on Not everyone gets laid.

368
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:18,293
Rym: you know I'm gonna quote now.

369
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:19,557
Rym: This is not me speaking.

370
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:23,628
Rym: This is the disembodied spirit of the average RIT student speaking.

371
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,848
Rym: ah That's what they said about college.

372
00:25:26,113 --> 00:25:29,722
Rym: Ah But no and you know.

373
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:34,970
Rym: they said oh well There's video game tournaments, and there's art people with art alley and blah blah blah.

374
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:39,818
Rym: I kept explaining you know all this stuff that goes on And I still really wasn't sure to what to expect.

375
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:44,033
Rym: so just all crammed into cars and drove to Ohio Which yeah.

376
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:50,410
Rym: now the problem is we went to a shit anime con that we did, Ohio con 2.0 was shitty.

377
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,410
Scott: I don't know about Ohio con now, but Ohio con 2 was ass.

378
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:57,388
Rym: It was still to this day the worst con I've ever been to.

379
00:25:59,314 --> 00:26:00,098
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

380
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:04,602
Rym: so I can't think there have been cons that were close But they never quite reached that level of.

381
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:10,461
Rym: not only was it bad But I'd paid for a badge And I didn't even need a badge because they didn't have any security.

382
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:19,930
Scott: we played settlers with a midget whore And that we played settlers of Catan with a midget whore and that is not an exaggeration at all.

383
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:28,870
Rym: That is the cold raw truth, and not not only was that not the only midget We encountered, but it was not the only whore we encountered.

384
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:35,909
Scott: we could have played settlers of Catan with the transvestite transsexual sailor Neptune.

385
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:38,334
Scott: What's the blue one?

386
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:39,778
Scott: Oh is the blue one Neptune?

387
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:40,440
Scott: did I get it right?

388
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,546
Rym: you you asshole?

389
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,890
Rym: I forgot about that.

390
00:26:43,991 --> 00:26:46,348
Rym: I seriously didn't remember that until just now.

391
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:49,137
Rym: oh That was the worst con ever.

392
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:55,037
Rym: yeah, it was yeah, but anyway What makes a con bad for us is real easy.

393
00:26:55,057 --> 00:27:10,768
Rym: if the con is unorganized at all if I go in and it's not immediately Obvious where I can get a badge Where all the stuff is or at least where I can find out where all the stuff is if I don't see staffers Periodically if there's no one checking my badge which means I didn't need to buy one to get in

394
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:12,796
Scott: Yeah, that'll piss me off.

395
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:20,888
Scott: if I don't need my badge to actually get in and I bought one Girl, I could have snuck into this con you better check it if you make me buy it.

396
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,550
Rym: yeah I mean, I I don't think I saw I don't think half the people at that, Ohio can't even had badges.

397
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:28,849
Scott: I know they definitely stopped checking them.

398
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:29,756
Scott: It's rich.

399
00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:31,330
Scott: only the video game room checked.

400
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:31,896
Scott: And you know what.

401
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:38,304
Scott: that video game room was weak And it was the only thing going on there that video game room was not as well equipped as our house.

402
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:41,054
Scott: No no it's not God.

403
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:44,290
Rym: hey, so yeah, I mean we basically number one.

404
00:27:44,651 --> 00:27:49,486
Rym: We want a con that is organized so that we don't have to worry about anything.

405
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:53,659
Rym: if we want to do an event We just look on the schedule show up at the event and the event will happen.

406
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,170
Scott: yep, and you know even the smallest bit of Disorganization can bother us.

407
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,750
Scott: I mean when we went to Kinetic Con and they didn't have five dollar bills when they were charging what?

408
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:13,384
Scott: $35 for a bad yeah, and they knew everyone in the world would have 20s And they didn't take credit cards, then you should know that you should have five dollar bills.

409
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:26,404
Rym: not having them girl Yeah, and they seem kind of angry at us that we were standing there You know waiting for our badges and not getting out of line and then yet There's nothing we could have done to rectify this situation.

410
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,936
Rym: we both had $20 bills.

411
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:31,707
Rym: even if we pooled our efforts they didn't have any $10 bills either.

412
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:36,081
Rym: Nope of course, then I wonder how would how is everyone?

413
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:36,482
Rym: I don't know.

414
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:36,884
Rym: I don't know.

415
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:38,790
Rym: I don't care that con is past.

416
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:46,834
Rym: We'll cover Kinetic Con next time yep, but I mean we went to the Oricon next which made us realize What cons are all about.

417
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:51,830
Rym: and for this day forth or from that day forth every con we go to we go primarily?

418
00:28:52,450 --> 00:29:00,013
Rym: Because our culture the culture that we are part of could be described generally as geeks Mm-hmm.

419
00:29:00,436 --> 00:29:07,230
Rym: and while we get along fine with non geeks Yeah, if you're with people who are like-minded and with similar interests you can generally have a better time.

420
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,754
Scott: Yeah, I mean out on the street I might see some.

421
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:21,170
Scott: you know there's a bunch of normal people, but I can't really like just spontaneously You know have a discussion with anyone in a restaurant about an anime or a video game or anything.

422
00:29:21,513 --> 00:29:26,866
Scott: I mean someone might look like a gamer But I'd have to go and meet them and find out what they're interested in.

423
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:33,665
Scott: and you know It's not easy to just have fun out with random people at a conventions.

424
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:37,577
Scott: You know special an anime convention People ever.

425
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:39,590
Scott: everyone there likes the same shit.

426
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:51,626
Scott: You could just immediately like whip out a DS and say who wants to play some Mario Kart and ten people be like me me Me yep, or I remember when we went to Otakon after the Leroy Jenkins thing had appeared.

427
00:29:51,646 --> 00:29:52,950
Rym: We're just out of the blue.

428
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:58,510
Rym: We were walking to the con and I think one of us just yell Leroy Leroy and half the con yelled Jenkins right back.

429
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,067
Rym: And then there was a tiny ruckus.

430
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:07,870
Rym: Yep It's very fun to be surrounded by like-minded people and we have friends that we only know from conventions.

431
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:09,397
Rym: And yet we're very good friends with them.

432
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:11,930
Rym: We see them every year at at least one con.

433
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:13,757
Rym: We're good friends forever.

434
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:16,690
Rym: and yet we know him only because we went to these anime cons.

435
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:20,299
Scott: Yeah, I mean it would be one thing.

436
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:26,370
Scott: if you know all the like-minded people lived in the same place Then a convention wouldn't really be necessary.

437
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:30,865
Scott: You know like if our culture was not geek culture, but popular culture.

438
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:32,430
Scott: What do we need a convention for?

439
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:33,454
Rym: Yeah, just everyone.

440
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:35,304
Scott: everyone is interested in the same stuff.

441
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:40,345
Scott: if you like sports and TV shows and reality shows go to a bar.

442
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:41,290
Scott: There's people there.

443
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:47,367
Scott: It's like a little convention every night But if you like geeky stuff you have to you know, you can't go to a bar.

444
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,190
Scott: There's no geek bar.

445
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:48,572
Scott: Oh, yes.

446
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,766
Scott: There's a few geek bars in the world, but not many.

447
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:59,392
Scott: Yeah You live in like San Francisco or like Toronto has that one Linux bar and maybe a couple other places But that's it.

448
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:04,550
Rym: Well like in Rochester of several times we decided to try and check out the nightlife of Rochester.

449
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:12,030
Rym: we went to a bunch of dance clubs over the years and Most of them sucked but that was mostly because Rochester's nightlife is pretty much non-existent.

450
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:18,879
Rym: Yeah, but - even when we found clubs that had people in them The music was just not music we cared about.

451
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,247
Rym: it wasn't even like good techno or good mod.

452
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:22,230
Rym: It was just nothing.

453
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:30,275
Scott: Yep I mean the only place you could really go for entertainment on a consistent regular basis was the gaming store Which wasn't open at night.

454
00:31:30,315 --> 00:31:33,230
Scott: it was open during the day and there would always be gamers there.

455
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:36,669
Rym: so now we go to a con and they've got the rave or the dance or whatever.

456
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:41,683
Rym: and Not only is it usually good music or at least good enough music usually.

457
00:31:41,704 --> 00:31:43,670
Scott: yeah, I'm cons are no good Oda kana.

458
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,211
Rym: God.

459
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:49,382
Rym: actually Katsucon has as far as all the cons.

460
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:51,470
Rym: I've been to some of the best dances ever.

461
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:53,176
Scott: Yeah, well, we'll see when we go there.

462
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,786
Rym: Yep, especially since last time or two times ago.

463
00:31:55,806 --> 00:31:59,117
Rym: They had 80s night Which made me feel very much at home.

464
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:00,541
Scott: It doesn't make me happy.

465
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:01,604
Rym: Yeah, mr.

466
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:09,216
Scott: Never heard of karma chameleon But supposed to know what the crap is.

467
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:15,490
Rym: and also the front row crew was formed at this point and you know It's modified change grown slightly over the years.

468
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:29,626
Rym: But even back then there was something about getting the whole crew together going to a foreign land like Chicago or Baltimore and Setting up our little encampment and then venturing out to recruit new people or to attack.

469
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:35,190
Scott: Yeah, depending It's mostly just a social a unique social experience.

470
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,709
Scott: That is the number one reason for a convention of any kind of any geek convention to exist.

471
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:45,530
Rym: So so I guess aside from that to not beat around the bush anymore in terms of the con itself.

472
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:48,830
Rym: So we can also end this episode and I can pack all my stuff together.

473
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,306
Scott: Yeah, I gotta go pack some clothes and my toiletries and shit.

474
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:58,249
Rym: Yep Yep, but in terms of the con itself the material of the con our perfect con generally is large.

475
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,338
Rym: my large I mean at least 5,000 people.

476
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:05,949
Scott: Yeah, if there aren't enough people there I mean sure with a maybe a thousand people you can have some fun.

477
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:11,650
Scott: But eventually you walk around the con and you keep seeing the same faces that you've seen already.

478
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:14,249
Scott: The same cosplay walks by again.

479
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:24,869
Scott: Yeah You know a con like that with so few people only needs to last one day just because or it needs to have so much Quality programming which is not easy.

480
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:31,590
Rym: So because not all programming appeals to all people plus smaller constant have less programming anyway, that's exasperating the problem.

481
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:37,365
Scott: Yes so if you're gonna have a Exacerbated you need a lot of people so that I can keep meeting new people.

482
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:38,670
Scott: the percentage of cool?

483
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:41,700
Scott: Well, the percentage of cool people will probably be the same at any con.

484
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:45,102
Scott: the total number of cool people will be greater at a Bigger con.

485
00:33:45,225 --> 00:34:05,518
Rym: Yes And that is key because it seems to me that in anime cons and gaming cons and all this All the cool people at a con tend to kind of form into one or two globs like all the cool people keep running into Each other and eventually like there's this giant mass of interconnected cool people totally separate from the seething teaming masses of

486
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,169
Scott: fat fans.

487
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,121
Scott: Well everyone at a convention is not.

488
00:34:09,183 --> 00:34:10,889
Scott: everyone at a convention is sociable.

489
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:22,458
Scott: the thing is there are enough sociable people that their awesomeness can occur and There's a critical mass, you know, it's like let's say I'm just making up numbers 15% of people at a convention are cool.

490
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,889
Scott: Well, if the convention is a hundred people, it's 15 cool people.

491
00:34:26,071 --> 00:34:27,475
Scott: The convention is a thousand people.

492
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:29,621
Scott: That's a hundred and fifty cool people.

493
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:34,310
Scott: if the convention is 10,000 people That's you know, yes, you get the idea.

494
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,161
Rym: Yep, and also aside from all that con has to be organized.

495
00:34:38,522 --> 00:34:41,009
Rym: con has to be in a convenient location.

496
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:43,629
Rym: by convenient I mean a major freaking city.

497
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:55,099
Scott: Yeah, well the thing is it's got to be near a lot of hotels But It also has to be in a nice Convention center of some sort or a nice hotel.

498
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,550
Rym: the con has to be on an interstate or I'm probably not gonna come to it.

499
00:34:58,678 --> 00:35:03,024
Scott: Yeah It has to be easy to get to but it doesn't necessarily have to be in a big city.

500
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:10,770
Scott: if there was somehow a really nice hotel Just outside of a big city as long as it was easy to get to it would be cool.

501
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:19,910
Rym: And in terms of programming I don't know what we want in terms of panels is barely achievable by the masses as far as I can tell.

502
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:40,550
Scott: Yeah, we want professional freaking amazing presentations at every turn like, you know listen to like the Byzantine twelve emperors rulers podcast, right and You're basically listening to an amazing lecture where someone who's a genius Informs you about these amazing things that you've never heard before.

503
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:51,826
Rym: Yeah and it's so ludicrously interesting that that you can't believe or listen to a stand-up comedian who has Well put together jokes and he's just telling to you in rapid succession.

504
00:35:52,027 --> 00:36:12,736
Scott: Yep, or You're going and you hear like two or three people who are like super important people in the industry who know their shit like like the back of their hand and They have a discussion and you're like a fly on the wall during this amazing discussion of all this interesting shit that you know people hardly ever talk about.

505
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:15,106
Scott: that's the kind of panel you have to have.

506
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,799
Scott: any other panel is Completely uninteresting.

507
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,378
Rym: I've seen maybe Eleven good panels in my entire life.

508
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:22,743
Scott: I don't know how many maybe three.

509
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,208
Rym: Well, I've been to more cons.

510
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:27,557
Rym: Yeah Yeah, yeah, and let's see.

511
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:30,930
Rym: I want a video game room to exist and I don't really care beyond that.

512
00:36:31,552 --> 00:36:35,570
Rym: I used to worry about playing DDR cons, but now I can play DDR whenever I want.

513
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:39,839
Scott: Yeah, if you have a game room, you're only really gonna get me in there

514
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,187
Rym: if we're guests at the game room

515
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:52,695
Scott: or if the game room has some sort of games that I really can't play anywhere else that I really want to play and that there's not gonna be a Way for me to play them in the future.

516
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:56,670
Rym: Yeah, last concert gone had that retro arcade, which was most fantastic.

517
00:36:56,991 --> 00:37:03,053
Scott: Yeah, I mean like back in the day dance dance revolution not easy to find a machine at the you in the u.s At the time.

518
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,910
Scott: not easy or cheap to get the home version at the time, you know.

519
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:13,766
Scott: So if a convention had the game available to play that was way cool And you would totally wait in line to play.

520
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:17,990
Scott: now I could go and there's three machines and Wildwood and I have pads in my house.

521
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:18,493
Scott: so who cares?

522
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:19,560
Rym: terms of showings?

523
00:37:19,982 --> 00:37:22,494
Rym: all I want is Horribly violent.

524
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:26,006
Rym: East Asian low-budget cinema prefer preferably live-action.

525
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:32,657
Scott: I agree That is the only thing I also want because if it's anime It's gonna be on DVD or fansub.

526
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:33,299
Scott: I can watch it.

527
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,986
Scott: if it's live-action air Asian cinema.

528
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:37,510
Scott: It's probably rare.

529
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:39,638
Scott: it's not easy to get it in the u.s.

530
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:46,270
Scott: Especially if it's unedited and subtitled and I've probably never heard of it and wouldn't know how to find it.

531
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:53,370
Scott: Your convention needs to have someone who knows about that shit can go out and find it can get it and then show it.

532
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:59,408
Rym: The only other thing I could see now now that I think about it is what if I can't like, you know Oh to con is that like the giant showing room?

533
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,498
Rym: What if they showed something like a door you die?

534
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,830
Rym: So sassen just as a super big showing.

535
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,504
Rym: So now you have the opportunity to watch something like that with a gigantic crowd.

536
00:38:09,524 --> 00:38:10,368
Scott: I'll be awesome.

537
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:10,870
Scott: I totally go.

538
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:13,163
Rym: Yeah, maybe I'll try to propose something like that.

539
00:38:13,183 --> 00:38:14,370
Scott: That would be so cool.

540
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,818
Scott: Yeah, the other thing convention I like it.

541
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:21,351
Scott: conventions is certain kinds of guests I like and certain kinds of guests I don't like.

542
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:29,978
Scott: like it doesn't matter if it's someone cool or someone not it matters if it's someone who will Entertain me at the convention.

543
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:34,616
Scott: For example, you might get Let's see.

544
00:38:34,736 --> 00:38:36,385
Scott: Let's try to think of someone like here.

545
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:39,058
Scott: Rintaro Was that anime next right?

546
00:38:39,238 --> 00:38:41,769
Scott: and we saw him at that panel where barely anyone was at?

547
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:47,010
Rym: And I don't know why no one was at that panel, yeah, but anyway Rintaro was way cool.

548
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:49,478
Scott: Hey, you know, he's a way cool guy.

549
00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:57,230
Scott: He's way awesome makes awesome stuff and his panel was okay But his presence wouldn't get me to a convention because what's he gonna do there?

550
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,985
Scott: He's gonna talk in Japanese about some stuff.

551
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:00,829
Scott: He's made that I've seen.

552
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,850
Rym: I mean granted that panel could have been a lot better.

553
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,290
Rym: It could have been a lot if the moderator had actually screened the questions from the audience at all.

554
00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:17,410
Rym: yeah, cuz half those questions were just I Expound for five minutes about how erudite I am when it comes to anime and I want to impress Rintaro.

555
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:23,880
Rym: And now I finish this long Rambling rant with a totally inane stupid question.

556
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,798
Scott: the whole separate GeekNights episode is how to ask a question at a panel that he's Always got feeding you up.

557
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:29,564
Rym: God.

558
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:35,746
Scott: We hate everyone No, but let's say you get someone like like muck.

559
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:37,050
Scott: muck was at Otakon, right?

560
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:40,401
Scott: They're just a myspace j-rock band.

561
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:41,003
Scott: there's really.

562
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:43,009
Scott: that's the truth, but you know what.

563
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:48,670
Scott: I Didn't go to the con for them, but I went to their whole concert and it was still awesome.

564
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:50,490
Rym: It was a great hard concert.

565
00:39:50,597 --> 00:40:03,810
Scott: Yeah Cuz I mean someone who's putting on a concert is able to provide me with like Oh hours of entertainment at a convention Whereas someone much more awesome than muck like Rintaro is not really an entertaining guy.

566
00:40:03,914 --> 00:40:16,109
Scott: I mean Maybe if I was staff or if I was another guest at the con and I was gonna spend a lot of time hanging out With Rintaro behind the scenes at the con then his presence would you know make me see

567
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:18,807
Rym: see now That's why you should be staff and an amazement with me.

568
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:20,697
Scott: Yeah, that amaze me.

569
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:24,212
Scott: if it wasn't so far away and I wasn't starting this new job I probably would.

570
00:40:24,252 --> 00:40:29,689
Rym: yeah cuz an amazement honestly has some of the best guests especially considering how large how small the con is.

571
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:36,988
Rym: Relative to other cons They get some guests that you really wouldn't expect and being staff is so awesome to hang out with those people at all.

572
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:47,418
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but yeah, generally a musical act I care about a lot and like the Laraku concert at Otakon a few years ago It was abso-fucking-lutely amazing.

573
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,302
Scott: Yeah, it has to be.

574
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:52,557
Scott: your guests have to provide Entertainment in order to make me happy.

575
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:57,890
Scott: It can't be someone who's gonna sit there and go like, you know, like oh We've got a voice actor.

576
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,799
Scott: I'm like voice actors.

577
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,750
Scott: don't entertain people.

578
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:08,950
Scott: All they do is say some things in their characters voices and make a few fangirls go Except the one god, I forget his name now, but I really like him.

579
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:15,225
Rym: He played a bunch of stuff in Urusayatsura But he was at an amazement and he put on an amazing freaking panel about how to voice act.

580
00:41:15,245 --> 00:41:16,910
Rym: That was absolutely awesome.

581
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,736
Scott: Oh, see, that's good.

582
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:18,521
Scott: You know, it's it.

583
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:22,701
Scott: the thing is if you You know just having them there isn't enough.

584
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:24,630
Scott: you have to find some way to make them entertain.

585
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,570
Scott: You know for most cases avoid that voice actor is not gonna entertain that much but you can get them to.

586
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:37,577
Scott: You know, like if you bring an artist right and you just have the artist give a panel, you know Whatever, you know what they drew whatever.

587
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:41,770
Scott: but then anime artists to like do some sort of art competition.

588
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:52,279
Rym: well I was about to say anime central did iron guest every time I went and They take like two famous artists like two of their guests Give them a topic and they do iron chef.

589
00:41:52,520 --> 00:42:05,202
Rym: only they both had to draw the topic in a half hour And then like they had the judges panel vote on it and they had a camera on both of their hands showing him as they drew And the guy went back and forth the interview and it moves super double awesome.

590
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:21,755
Scott: Yeah, you've got to make Something that entertains me for me to go to it because if there's nothing entertaining going on in the programming I'm gonna walk around to the dealer's room and the artist alley and the hallways and wherever and if I don't find anything to do I'm gonna be bored.

591
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:23,764
Scott: I'm not gonna be happy in a perfect world.

592
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:24,708

630
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:04,469

631
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:08,605

Rym: Yeah cosplay I don't care about as long as it's there Cuz one.

633
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:19,275
Rym: it means that all the cosplayers will come and I like to look at their costumes and it always adds something to The con to all.

634
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:24,010
Rym: those people are not removed from the convention for four hours so I can run around and make mischief.

635
00:44:24,612 --> 00:44:28,025

636
00:44:28,045 --> 00:44:32,479

637
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,590
Scott: They really wish they could make a con like that.

638
00:44:34,991 --> 00:44:36,335
Scott: The problem is a con like that.

639
00:44:36,997 --> 00:44:44,861
Scott: So few people would come, you know compared to another con and It just there wouldn't be stuff happening.

640
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:46,408
Scott: It would just be like people sitting around going.

641
00:44:46,428 --> 00:44:55,190
Rym: Hey Hey, I think we're just gonna stop here because I mean we could talk about dealers room and artists alley But I think I can sum it up very briefly in terms of both of those.

642
00:44:55,270 --> 00:45:01,090
Rym: We just want Otakon because no con comes even close to Otakon when it comes to an amazing artists alley.

643
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,243
Scott: I want a dealers room that has stuff for sale.

644
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:07,836
Scott: that is out of the ordinary Stuff that I can't find anywhere else.

645
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:12,733
Scott: if I walk around the dealers room and I see stuff that I've seen everywhere else I don't care.

646
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:15,204

Scott: I walked around.

649
00:45:17,196 --> 00:45:17,781
Scott: then I was like, huh?

650
00:45:17,943 --> 00:45:18,690
Scott: Look at all this shit.

651
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:29,550
Rym: I didn't expect this but with anime central being a close-up a distant second Otakon is the only con where I actually really enjoyed the artist alley and artists alley is really all about.

652
00:45:29,991 --> 00:45:31,556
Scott: You know quantity and quality.

653
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:34,907

655
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:40,390

656
00:45:40,692 --> 00:45:51,970
Scott: If there's you know a hundred artists I'm gonna spend a lot of time in there because I want to check out every single artist that's going down and you know Get sketches and commissions and buy things
