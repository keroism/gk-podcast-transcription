00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,872
Rym: It's Wednesday January 22nd 2020.

2
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:12,253
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,459
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:23,180
Rym: tonight We are talking about something that I can't believe we have never talked about on GeekNights beat-ass Batman the animated series.

5
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:26,818
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:41,260
Rym: so I moved into this building a decade ago and when I moved in the literal first thing I did was like walk around the apartment like look at stuff and the second thing I did was the Verizon FiOS to come install itself.

7
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:41,863
Scott: That's right.

8
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:43,430
Scott: So installed itself.

9
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:49,286
Rym: Well someone came and back then like FiOS was a lot harder to get installed than it is now.

10
00:00:49,747 --> 00:01:08,730
Rym: They put this gigantic fucking box like in the wall of my apartment filled with like a giant battery and all this crap and all these things for like phone service that I didn't need and I've had the router that they gave me and that box just running as is for a decade.

11
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:27,390
Rym: like I have this ancient ancient plan that's like 60 up 60 down and I randomly logged into the site the other day and just like looking at the account because occasionally I like log into accounts I have and make sure there's nothing new we're doing and They had a thing where I could basically get more speed because the plans are so different now from a decade ago.

12
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:31,164
Scott: Our plan is like three or four hundred up and you know, like that.

13
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:35,999
Rym: So I'm paying now like $25 a month less to get from 60 to 100.

14
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:47,130
Rym: Mmm, and I think they incentivized it because They came and in the Mimi room in the building They like replaced a bunch of Verizon like shit down there and then they pulled that entire box out of my wall.

15
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:55,442
Rym: And now in the giant compartment where that box was there's just one Tiny little o-nt just hanging out there with the fiber terminating in it.

16
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:56,124
Scott: Yeah.

17
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:57,850
Scott: I mean, that's ten years of advancement.

18
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,520
Rym: Yeah, the new router they gave me actually works way better.

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,450
Scott: That router looks enormous and doesn't look at all like the one I got.

20
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,944
Rym: Oh, yeah, the router is enormous, but it has modern like really good Wi-Fi.

21
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:08,229
Rym: The old router was real old.

22
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,483
Scott: Yeah, I mean the one they gave me has really good Wi-Fi.

23
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:14,622
Scott: I just don't like the The the UI when you go to its web interface.

24
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:16,130
Rym: Yeah, the UI is not great.

25
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,589
Scott: It has a surprising number of features, but not as many as you know, like a gear router.

26
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:24,241
Rym: But I can do like full port forwarding.

27
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:24,904
Rym: I could set up DMZ.

28
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:28,318
Scott: Yeah, you can do all that kind of stuff I got routing rules DHCP configuration.

29
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,350
Scott: It's just really hard and annoying to do anything like that.

30
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,790
Rym: Yeah, but so the funny thing is I learned something kind of sad about everyone in this building.

31
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:44,394
Rym: Apparently I was the rising guy said I was literally the last person to have the old busted files Like ancient files shit.

32
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:52,544
Rym: So when he came in he goes to replace it and he tries to put the router in the front closet Like by itself, there's no ethernet cables or anything over there.

33
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,628
Rym: and I was like, whoa Whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34
00:02:55,092 --> 00:03:00,478
Rym: No, you got to get that into my computer room like the last guy did and he's like well Do you have you think I run it over there?

35
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:09,711
Rym: And of course I don't because this building There's no way to get ethernet over there because the cable path to get to my closet goes outside of my apartment into like building infrastructure Mm-hmm.

36
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:16,314
Rym: So basically I was like, oh I already got it set up and he comes in and he's like, oh you're using the coax Mm-hmm.

37
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:18,910
Rym: You'd I've never seen someone actually get that going.

38
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,572
Rym: How'd you do it?

39
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:30,770
Rym: And I thought back and I remembered something I'd forgotten when the first Verizon guy came ten years ago He went to set up all my crap and I was like I'm gonna cancel this unless you can get this thing into my computer room.

40
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:32,576
Rym: Like I'm not using wireless only.

41
00:03:32,616 --> 00:03:33,720
Rym: this is 2010.

42
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,024
Rym: It's a modern era.

43
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:35,987
Rym: I want wired internet.

44
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:41,363
Rym: So We start fucking around and there's all these ethernet like ports in our apartment.

45
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:42,667
Rym: as far as we can tell.

46
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,268
Rym: they just go to hell Like they don't go anywhere.

47
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,438
Scott: But yeah, I see some right there.

48
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,450
Scott: Those definitely look like they go to the telephone.

49
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,842
Rym: Yeah, one's one's an rj-50 like a telephone and one's an rj-45.

50
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:53,870
Scott: really is a cable in there.

51
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,103
Scott: Yeah the top one does look a little bigger.

52
00:03:55,123 --> 00:04:02,003
Rym: so He gave me his toner and I like went around like trying to figure out where these cables go and they just go Nowhere, they go to the abyss.

53
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:02,650
Rym: They're gone forever.

54
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:08,510
Rym: But there is a coax network in my apartment that goes to every room.

55
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:09,233
Scott: Yeah, it's man.

56
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,343
Scott: It's probably cuz time Warner was also in this building.

57
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:11,906
Scott: I've seen.

58
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:12,810
Scott: I've seen them in the lobby.

59
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:22,947
Rym: That's for cable television and I toned it and one of the ports in the bedroom and the living room and the computer room Was also live in the front closet near the FiOS box.

60
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:26,180
Rym: Mmm So I so I was like will this work?

61
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:29,850
Rym: and he put a tight like he did a signal tester and he was like There's nothing else using it.

62
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:39,175
Rym: I'm pretty sure there's a like an Unterminated coax cable in the basement of this building in the meet-me room just like plugged into nothing and that's where the other shitty service Would go if I use them.

63
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,822
Scott: Well, yeah this what it is.

64
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:44,253
Scott: if because I've seen in my previous Apartment, right?

65
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:48,890
Scott: It was only Time Warner and basically what they have in the basement is this block, right?

66
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:58,185
Scott: Oh that building had 12 apartments and in the block there were 12 Places to hook up cable that is and then there were 12 wires with stickers on them.

67
00:04:58,205 --> 00:04:59,470
Scott: that said which apartments they were?

68
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:08,930
Scott: Yeah, and if you didn't pay they just unplugged your wire From the thing and then they it was in a metal box of the lock on it So you'd have to bust it open to give yourself cable.

69
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,130
Rym: Yeah Our building is like a full-on meet-me room for all the equipment in there and they did there was there's already.

70
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:15,397
Scott: This is in the laundry room.

71
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:27,514
Rym: Yeah, this is like like in the basement of the building But they have they run fiber of a bunch of different types and coax and it looks like Ethernet, too every apartment mmm, so That's all set up now.

72
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,606
Scott: My new apartment just has Ethernet in the wall and it just works.

73
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:34,782
Rym: I didn't have to do anything Yep, but the guy was basically like seems like you know what you're doing.

74
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:38,118
Rym: That's pretty clever using the coax And he was kind of excited about it.

75
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:39,325
Rym: So we hooked it all up and it worked fine.

76
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:47,464
Scott: So My internet wonder if because it's coax if it might be like your max if you want it So coax your max speed might be lower coax.

77
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:51,438
Rym: My max speed is Around a hundred no matter what I do.

78
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:51,960
Scott: See they try.

79
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,084
Scott: you can buy like.

80
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,610
Scott: we got what we chose the plan.

81
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,058
Scott: That was like three or four hundred ish.

82
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:58,030
Rym: Yeah, I could write that there was a higher plan.

83
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,650
Scott: That was gigabit and it's like, you know, ten fifteen twenty, maybe twenty dollars on that.

84
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:04,717
Scott: It's like with the speed.

85
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,307
Scott: we've never used all that we've got with the three hundred four hundred.

86
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:08,689
Rym: if I bought gigabit You know what I would do.

87
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,898
Rym: I think we could know why I would sell.

88
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,316
Rym: I would just be a fake like bootleg ISP and sell internet to everyone Our friends who live in the same building.

89
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:18,429
Scott: they got the gigabit and I'm like why you're spending like a thousand dollars a year.

90
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,601
Rym: Perspective we're streaming GeekNights live right now.

91
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,329
Rym: You know how much that's using six.

92
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:24,534
Scott: Yeah, we're streaming.

93
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:28,248
Scott: 1080p content up takes six six megabits per second.

94
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:28,650
Scott: That's right.

95
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:39,030
Rym: So I got a hundred now and I tested it and despite the coax being the limiter I get about 98 down reliably and I get about a hundred and forty up which is fascinating.

96
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:43,190
Rym: But I think we did an ancient show about like wires and stuff.

97
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,630
Rym: I think we explained coaxial cable and like why that is a limitation, but that's neither here nor there.

98
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:51,160
Rym: I got a whole new digital pipeline for GeekNights.

99
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:51,944
Rym: I got all new internet.

100
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,430
Rym: the computer rooms like nicely cleaned up.

101
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:54,775
Rym: I got a brand new bed.

102
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:55,779
Rym: I got a brand new armoire.

103
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,827
Rym: This is the shit that you get excited about.

104
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:57,948
Scott: it.

105
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:58,470
Scott: all his money.

106
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:00,196
Scott: Yeah, he's getting in line for that.

107
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:04,230
Scott: Yo, he really went first class on the flight to to and from Pac South.

108
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,098
Scott: Well, he's the one if you got.

109
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:08,147
Scott: if anyone out there is setting up their guillotine.

110
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:08,549
Scott: I got.

111
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:11,774
Rym: you know This is not first class.

112
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,899
Rym: Like you get a little room or a bed.

113
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:21,380
Rym: This is The American domestic first-class meaning the seats slightly wider and they give you food cause way more money than in the back.

114
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:22,847
Rym: Yeah, but I did not pay that money.

115
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,375
Rym: I got the upgrade on the way.

116
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,320
Rym: They're three names.

117
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:26,478
Scott: He did not pay all that money.

118
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:31,218
Rym: Dude business travel gives you status on like every airline and they'll just give you free upgrades.

119
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,686
Rym: the flight There was not sold out.

120
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:36,645
Rym: So I got like trivial just free upgrade On the way back.

121
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:39,859
Rym: the flight was definitely gonna sell out and was already pretty crowded.

122
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,426
Scott: Amanda An empty seat next to her.

123
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,154
Scott: so it was me only ninety nine point.

124
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:44,460
Scott: nine nine nine percent sold out.

125
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:52,205
Rym: So I was not willing to pay extra money for first class on a domestic flight because it would have been like several hundred Dollars, it's not worth it.

126
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:59,440
Rym: The flight was our base right was only two or three hundred up But I have a shit ton of points and miles on Delta.

127
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:03,578
Rym: So I spent miles to upgrade to first class which basically cost me almost nothing.

128
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:09,733
Rym: Mm-hmm I had to pay like a $20 fee To use the miles, but that also paid for the flight.

129
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:10,737
Rym: so I got the flight free.

130
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:11,380
Rym: Mm-hmm.

131
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,546
Rym: So just the.

132
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:19,400
Rym: if you fly a lot just try to always fly like the same airline and you'll just automatically get a bunch of free stuff anyway.

133
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,806
Rym: So it's Wednesday.

134
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:22,349
Rym: We're back.

135
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:22,931
Rym: We're bad.

136
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:24,599
Rym: We had a lot to talk about.

137
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:27,550
Rym: Still can't believe we didn't talk about B tasks and we'll get to that.

138
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:29,658
Rym: but there is a bunch of anime animation news.

139
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:36,722
Scott: first off I didn't even know this movie was coming the me not until today cuz I was looking if you don't know Weathering with you.

140
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:39,633
Scott: the new Makoto shinkai joint like just came out.

141
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:41,480
Scott: It's currently in theaters in the u.s.

142
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,248
Rym: It's breaking by his record.

143
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,111
Rym: They had to.

144
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,116
Scott: they had two nights.

145
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:46,100
Scott: Well, that was a while ago.

146
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,789
Scott: They had two nights of like fan preview screenings.

147
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,719
Scott: And then after that it was just regular screenings, you know.

148
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:54,248
Scott: So this is the Makoto shinkai who you know.

149
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:56,294
Scott: did you know your name?

150
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,037
Scott: and whatnot, right?

151
00:08:57,117 --> 00:08:57,819
Scott: Oh cloud, man.

152
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,768
Rym: Please promise no early days, right?

153
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:00,852
Scott: That's where we met him first.

154
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:05,753
Scott: Anyway, uh This is new movie and It's I know we are weathering you.

155
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:06,440
Rym: we'll talk about first.

156
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:07,288
Scott: I've been trying to.

157
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,420
Scott: I've been trying to like, you know Get everyone together to go see it and the movie theater here has been showing it but at weird times.

158
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,646
Scott: So I'm just like I fuck it.

159
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:16,716
Scott: I'm gonna see it tomorrow with or without anyone else.

160
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:18,345
Rym: Yeah, I'm Emily I already saw it.

161
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:19,291
Rym: So we're good there.

162
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:23,980
Rym: I Won't review it right now because we're obviously gonna review it on GeekNights.

163
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:30,116
Rym: But to give you a geek bite what I will say about it is that it is the most Makoto shinkai in terms of.

164
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:31,687
Scott: I mean This is a guy who is just.

165
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:32,049
Scott: he's like.

166
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:35,608
Scott: he knows what his thing is and rather than like Try to go out of his box.

167
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:37,479
Scott: He just goes more and more in his box.

168
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:39,005
Scott: This was like, all right.

169
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:39,868
Scott: Now we're gonna make it.

170
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:43,240
Scott: every movie I've ever made is actually secretly about clouds.

171
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:48,260
Scott: I'm just gonna make a movie weathering with you literally directly up in your face with the class.

172
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,954
Rym: Yes, not to spoil anything, but it's kind of a lot of girl.

173
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:51,839
Rym: It turns into a cloud.

174
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,675
Scott: Yeah, that's the most Makoto shinkai thing I've ever heard.

175
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:59,553
Rym: also about climate change Yeah, you don't say and it's also about lovers separated by space and time.

176
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:00,416
Scott: you mean everything.

177
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:01,339
Scott: go to shinkai movie.

178
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:01,740
Scott: that's about.

179
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:07,019
Rym: Yeah, but I will say I don't think it's his best movie.

180
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:11,010
Rym: I think your name is a much better tighter movie.

181
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:14,219
Rym: I enjoyed weathering with you a lot, but it has a few.

182
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,005
Scott: Was there that one he made?

183
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:17,168
Scott: that was real man.

184
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:19,475
Scott: The one we saw at New York Comic Con.

185
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:20,578
Rym: Oh children who.

186
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,040
Rym: so it's funny.

187
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,345
Rym: I was talking to Emily and I was like I think this is his worst movie after weathering with you like there's still a high bar But I think it's his worst one.

188
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:29,380
Rym: and Emily was like, what about children who chase lost voices?

189
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:32,204
Scott: Was not good?

190
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,020
Rym: children who chase lost voices is basically just like an air sats Ghibli movie.

191
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,208
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what the hell that thing.

192
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:43,880
Rym: I remember seeing it and not getting And remove the environmental storytelling and replace it with a plot that goes nowhere.

193
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:45,875
Scott: Maybe I should watch it again just to see what the hell is.

194
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,844
Rym: it's pretty weathering with you.

195
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:55,606
Scott: I put it in the same bucket as the the the Ghibli You know, oh the Ghibli.

196
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:56,389
Rym: Yeah.

197
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,097
Rym: Yeah, we will not speak of Goro's bad movie.

198
00:10:59,238 --> 00:10:59,760
Scott: Yeah that one.

199
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,120
Rym: But the one thing I'll say about weathering with you without spoiling anything that the two things that disappoint me is one.

200
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:10,092
Rym: There's one reading of the movie that is about relationships.

201
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:11,055
Rym: That's a pretty good like.

202
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:12,540
Rym: there's a good message there.

203
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,548
Rym: There's a good theme there.

204
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:18,655
Rym: that's told pretty well to the story but there's a much more direct reading.

205
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:22,999
Rym: that is Kind of a problematic message about climate change.

206
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:29,225
Rym: now Maybe you shouldn't try that hard to try to stop it really like just live with it like weather it out Like it's hard to uh-huh.

207
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:30,409
Rym: You'll see when you watch it.

208
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,380
Rym: anyway, I mean with it it involves a gun.

209
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:34,562
Scott: Okay.

210
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,148
Scott: Well Japan, you know a gun is a big deal.

211
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:38,055
Rym: Yeah, the guns a weirdly big deal.

212
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:46,000
Rym: in the movie like Without the gun things don't work out that I did not expect him at this movie to have that gun.

213
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:54,373
Scott: Anyway, so while I was you know arranging right, you know this movie I was like, well, you know my friends We can't see this anime movie together.

214
00:11:54,393 --> 00:12:00,340
Scott: We'll see it separately Yeah, but I'm sure there will be another anime movie soon for us to watch because they just keep coming right?

215
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,765
Rym: Oh, and I went I just keep coming.

216
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:06,626
Scott: Mamoru Hosoda has been reliably doing one movie every three years So he's not coming back till 2021.

217
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,337
Scott: Yeah, right wolf walkers is coming this year.

218
00:12:09,377 --> 00:12:11,365
Rym: That's not oh fuck I forgot about that entirely.

219
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:13,113
Scott: That's not anime, but whatever.

220
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:13,836
Rym: I'm still into it.

221
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:17,569
Rym: It's probably better than it Trigger BNA like we didn't know that much about it.

222
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:21,121
Rym: Yeah, there's so much in the pipeline and then suddenly you awesome Right.

223
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:28,368

224
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:28,809

Rym: You got everything sinks about Japan, but Japan sinks.

233
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,509
Rym: Apparently he's also directing.

234
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,925
Rym: Keep your hands off a Zouken Super Shiro ride.

235
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,772
Rym: your wave is the one we're about to talk about.

236
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:59,067
Rym: devil man cryberry the crybaby the show Lu over the wall, which we just reviewed.

237
00:12:59,067 --> 00:12:59,970
Rym: 2017 also 2017 the night is short.

238
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:05,789
Rym: walk on girl Which is one of my favorite goddamn anime movies ever right?

239
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:07,775
Scott: So this guy's cranking out like to a year.

240
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:10,685
Scott: Yeah, right Man it was.

241
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:14,900
Scott: it was where his hosted is doing one every three, of course what hosted as late as Mirai?

242
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:15,688
Scott: That was way good.

243
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:22,280
Rym: Yeah, man We're living in a golden age of just anime and animation like this is good time to show Mirai, right?

244
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:23,588
Rym: I don't think so.

245
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:24,474
Scott: We saw it.

246
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:26,265
Rym: Yeah I'll double check.

247
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:28,576
Scott: you saw right with the in the weird architect house.

248
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:35,720
Rym: Yeah, okay We uh, although we gotta look at all the anime we've seen that we just haven't in inexplicably if not reviewed like BTS.

249
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:47,030
Rym: The first episode anyway, so ride your wave seems to also have themes of Water as metaphor for death and or transformation.

250
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:51,623
Scott: Well, didn't the vampire dog movie also have that Lu over the wall.

251
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:51,984
Rym: Yeah.

252
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:53,228
Rym: Yeah Lu over the wall.

253
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:57,077
Rym: I feel like water was definitely a metaphor for death or loss.

254
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:00,646
Rym: Maybe transition like.

255
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:04,160
Rym: arguably this one seems like it's more about transition, but could also be about death and or loss.

256
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:09,218
Scott: Who knows but this is coming to theaters next month, but February something I mean.

257
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:11,359
Rym: All I'll say is that so far?

258
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,428
Rym: Masaki Yuasa is basically patting a thousand with me and I'm just gonna keep riding this train as long as it goes trains gonna go Straight into the water.

259
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:17,791
Rym: Mm-hmm.

260
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:28,568
Scott: So in some other news, oh, yeah So long ago in the days when like vertical comics was like at their peak of bringing you over Tezuka mangas and all that biz, right?

261
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:29,853
Scott: Yeah, and and they were.

262
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:33,293
Scott: they were the hot shit, you know You would see them at conventions all the time.

263
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:39,640
Scott: I'd be like, hey They would ask people like hey, what manga do you want us to bring to the u.s?

264
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:47,866
Scott: They would actually put out surveys to find out what manga's they fans in the know knew about because there's so many Yeah that we could bring over.

265
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:55,759
Scott: obviously you just think the only rule was you couldn't mention any mangas that were obviously unavailable From like, you know shonen jump company Shueisha or whatever, right?

266
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,226
Scott: But any other company was totally fine because they could license from them and I would always say hey we want to get st Young men that's the comic we want.

267
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:04,851
Scott: bring that shit over in English.

268
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:11,919
Scott: and they would always tell me because they were so honest and Cool, they'd be like look that one is like basically number one on our list as well.

269
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,680
Scott: Yeah, right, but the problem is is the person who made it, you know, the actual creator is like.

270
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:19,546
Scott: Right, they're very.

271
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:20,752
Scott: they got issues, right?

272
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:21,334
Scott: They don't want to.

273
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,259
Scott: they don't want to let us do it.

274
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:23,206
Scott: So it's we did.

275
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:23,830
Scott: we can't do it.

276
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:33,915
Scott: All right, so Lo behold look through the comic book catalog recently and there I see it Saint young men volume 1 and I ordered that shit and I got it.

277
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:34,880
Scott: I'm about to read it.

278
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:42,140
Rym: I didn't read it yet But I mean I've read it before mister who might be too young to have listened to us talk about this a long time ago.

279
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:42,765
Rym: What is st.

280
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:43,914
Rym: Young men about st.

Scott: Young men?

282
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,270
Scott: The name it's weird cuz like it's those.

283
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:49,320
Scott: you hear the name and you're like, what the hell is that about?

284
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,805
Rym: That sounds like generic.

285
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:53,957
Scott: Then once you hear what it's about the name, it makes perfect sense.

286
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,967
Scott: It is about Buddha literally Buddha.

287
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:02,944
Scott: Yeah Buddha and literally Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Christ The crown of thorns.

288
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:05,130
Rym: He's just wearing the crown of thorns all the time.

289
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,806
Scott: Oh, yeah, they're young men in Japan Modern Tokyo.

290
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,874
Scott: Well modern day is the time of the writing of the comic.

291
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:16,288
Scott: Yeah, and they are roommates Yep, living out their life being tourists.

292
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:21,060
Scott: I feel like I need to read taken everything taken a vacation from being gods or whatever.

293
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,197
Rym: There are Saints living in Tokyo, Japan Buddha the enlightened one and Jesus son of God.

294
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:41,600
Rym: Yeah After successfully bringing the previous century to the clothes to a close that you share an apartment in Tachikawa While enjoying some well-earned time off down on earth Buddha pinches pennies like a typical neighborhood housewife while Jesus is prone to making impulse buys.

295
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:45,459
Scott: This comic is way good.

296
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:50,292
Rym: I've seen like bits of it like scans lated and it was pretty funny.

297
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,740
Scott: I read a chat few chapters of it way back.

298
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:53,779
Scott: That's how I knew about it.

299
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:02,979
Scott: But you know now finally it's coming out in print and I think actually a whole bunch of it is available if you do Kindle comics ology Chats like present day present time.

300
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:09,375
Scott: But if you want the the actual physical versions legit in English available.

301
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:12,644
Scott: volume 1 now volume 2 soon I'm into it.

302
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:13,145
Scott: Mm-hmm.

303
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,513
Rym: So in some other I would do a brief geek bite.

304
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:17,160
Rym: cuz I like the dragon Prince.

305
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:23,940
Rym: It's out and it's either done or the first arc is done and it'll get picked up for like a new arc.

306
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:26,713
Rym: But the three seasons completed right we watch.

307
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:28,098
Scott: I've only seen two season.

308
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,991
Scott: So I watch the third season.

309
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:31,339
Rym: third season is real good.

310
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,680
Rym: It rushes a little bit in a few parts.

311
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:38,620
Rym: But all I will say without spoiling anything is that the ending is really good.

312
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:40,709
Rym: It wraps up enough to where.

313
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,860
Rym: if there weren't more I'd be okay with that.

314
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:46,580
Scott: So they they reveal the dead bird that everyone knows since episode one.

315
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:48,689
Rym: So the dead bird does not get dealt with.

316
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:50,838
Scott: well, fuck that then it can't end.

317
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:57,951
Scott: Yeah I'm not because I don't know not because I need that reveal cuz I know But because I just need I need that to go somewhere.

318
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:01,348
Scott: I need for anyone to Be like.

319
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,154
Scott: see I told you.

320
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:05,852
Rym: so yep I uh, but everything else resolves really well.

321
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:07,880
Rym: the stuff that happens in the end is good.

322
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:14,907
Rym: But the thing I'll point out in particular is that there's a romantic subplot that once it gets introduced They just fucking like me.

323
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:15,510
Rym: I cuz I'm homie.

324
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:15,952
Rym: We're done.

325
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:16,555
Rym: They're dating.

326
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:17,077
Rym: Let's go.

327
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:17,740
Rym: Let's move on.

328
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,731
Rym: It doesn't turn into a typical thing.

329
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:20,716
Rym: It works.

330
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,291
Rym: and two There's a big battle.

331
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:35,598
Rym: in the last episode the battle is Really really well choreographed Better than any big fantasy battle I've seen in most animated shows ever.

332
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:36,862
Rym: Mm-hmm It's just.

333
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:39,854
Rym: it's a. like the fight choreography of this battle

334
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:43,484
Scott: cowboy bebop episode one or Like Lord of the Rings

335
00:18:43,604 --> 00:18:44,186
Rym: like

336
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:44,266
Scott: III

337
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:54,476
Rym: I would say that the fights at the end of some armies facing off has better Massive mass fighting fight choreography than any Lord of the Rings movie

338
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:55,599
Scott: like five deadly venoms.

339
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:56,663
Rym: Not that level.

340
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:59,069
Rym: zoom down zoomed out level of like.

341
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,359
Rym: there is a real battle and tactics and strategies and a shield wall Total war video games.

342
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,439
Rym: Yeah like imagine one of those total war video games like.

343
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:11,200
Rym: It avoids the problem of there's a big generic battle and a few main characters and stuff.

344
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:11,802
Rym: Then they win.

345
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:17,340
Rym: it really focuses on like the ebb and flow of a real battle in a very satisfying way.

346
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:24,219
Rym: Like the battle stood out to me and it only has one silly kid thing I haven't auctioned shows up at one point in the battle.

347
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:25,579
Rym: No gang so watch for that.

348
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:28,129
Rym: But the show is deeply satisfying.

349
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:34,030
Rym: if you're holding out like to decide if Dragon Prince was good before you watch it It is super worth episode on Dragon Prince already.

350
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,857
Rym: Yeah, but now it's over.

351
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:44,600
Rym: It's great things Of the day what he got for me.

352
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:48,890
Scott: So when I was at mag fest I went and did something on the schedule.

353
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:52,910
Scott: There was a little like a little tabletop game jam and it was only two hours.

354
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:59,091
Scott: Oh, yeah, followed by a 90-minute play test and I was like damn that is not a large time investment for a four-day 24/7 con.

355
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:00,656
Scott: no, right.

356
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,422
Scott: I will go there and see what's up.

357
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:05,010
Scott: So I went there sat at a table with three other nerds.

358
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:11,966
Scott: We made a as much of a game as you could make in two hours is a good game You know, it wasn't the worst, right?

359
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:17,063
Scott: Anyway, you know and then we sort of play tested one game.

360
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:21,919
Scott: Maybe they played, you know, whatever You know, it was a slight.

361
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,150
Scott: it was someone else's game that was slapped together in two hours.

362
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:27,714
Scott: So funnily enough hard to figure out, you know What was going on without.

363
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:33,430
Rym: I missed that session not because I didn't want to go but because I stopped to play someone's game.

364
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,510
Rym: They were demoing their indie tabletop game in tabletop and they were also gonna go to the game jam.

365
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:41,089
Rym: But they got so into teaching me the game that they were like.

366
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:50,575
Scott: I want to skip the game jam so I can teach you this game anyway, so Afterwards, I was just chatting with one of the people I made a game with and I was like, you know Everyone has a nerdy thing.

367
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:56,988
Scott: one guy who I made a game with was like a twitch streamer or something Right and everyone everyone has their thing, right?

368
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,850
Scott: So the guy I was talking to he said yeah, I make this like video series, right?

369
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:07,250
Scott: It's sort of like, you know, it's sort of like an SCA kind of deal, right?

370
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,330
Scott: Basically, it's you know a live-action, you know fictional video series.

371
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,470
Scott: That's you know, some fantasy fairytale kind of thing.

372
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:26,730
Scott: It looks like you know, some SCA people recording a movie in the woods some larpers in the woods You know with a thing right and I was like, okay, so I had really low as expectations.

373
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:36,770
Scott: Yeah Right from what amounts to SCA Larpers in the woods recording a short fictional video series not unwarranted, right?

374
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,800
Scott: So I watch you know, the first episode.

375
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:41,145
Scott: once I see that it's so short.

376
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:43,393
Scott: I'm like, okay, whatever I got nothing to lose.

377
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:44,938
Scott: This only has like a few hundred views.

378
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:48,170
Rym: Maybe not even right on the 20th person to like it.

379
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:49,315
Scott: Yeah, not a lot.

380
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:52,190
Scott: All right, so I'm like, is this actually gonna be good?

381
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:52,773
Scott: And you know what?

382
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:54,445
Scott: It's not gonna blow your mind.

383
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:58,267
Rym: with his goodness I was waiting for you to be like, it's amazing.

384
00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:03,370
Scott: No But it was vastly exceeding my extremely low expectation.

385
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:07,650
Scott: All right, right like I kind of your new listeners coming from Scott.

386
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,236
Rym: That is a weirdly high compliment.

387
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:11,524
Scott: like I started I started watching it and I was like, huh?

388
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:13,150
Scott: The acting isn't awful.

389
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,376
Scott: It's like community theater level acting.

390
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,181
Scott: maybe maybe a little better right.

391
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:20,730
Scott: the videoing, you know, not the worst, right?

392
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,970
Scott: You know, it's like there's nothing really mind-blowing about it, but it's like, okay, I can see what's happening.

393
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:26,569
Scott: The audio sounds good.

394
00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:28,073
Scott: You know.

395
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,522
Scott: the sets, you know are what they are.

396
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:38,990
Scott: They look like some nerds left them together But and the actual fairy tale was you know, somewhat moderately compelling like I wanted to know what happened.

397
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:40,730
Scott: All right, it's about this fair.

398
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:41,192
Scott: You know This.

399
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:53,877
Scott: this lady is on a you know Walking through the woods to visit her friend who lives in the woods house And she passes a fairy tied up to a tree in the woods and starts bargaining with it But not like a moron getting fooled by it.

400
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:56,206
Scott: Yeah, and that was pretty pretty good.

401
00:22:56,667 --> 00:23:02,210
Rym: Yeah, there you go It's tough because I feel like any magical creature I'd be easily tricked by because I just be hoping they teach me magic.

402
00:23:02,392 --> 00:23:08,230
Scott: This is basically yeah, it's like, you know It was like that common setup of magical creature in the woods trying to fool you.

403
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,337
Scott: I mean, I'm not gonna listen.

404
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,390
Scott: who's actually smart and won't be fooled by it?

405
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:23,490
Rym: This is why our friend scojo has put me on his list of people who cannot ever be allowed to make a deal with Satan Devils of any kind because if I'm walking through the woods they bump into like some sort of like fantasy creature.

406
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:24,876
Rym: That's like yo dog.

407
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:26,684
Rym: I'll give you power if you help me out.

408
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:27,910
Rym: I would probably help him out.

409
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,225
Scott: So it's called far from the path a fairy tale web series.

410
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:37,601
Scott: I've only watched segment one So I but I presume the further segments are similar in nature.

411
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:38,102
Rym: Yeah.

412
00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:38,884
Rym: All right, I'm game.

413
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:54,765
Rym: So we were having a conversation I don't know if even if this was on GeekNights or just in our life about Complicated rhythms in songs a little while ago and I mentioned that I just seen a really good video That's really recent where this dude David Bennett.

414
00:23:54,825 --> 00:24:01,790
Rym: It was a good YouTube channel Actually explains in detail with specific examples and they play songs.

415
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,753
Rym: You can listen to it.

416
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:08,590
Rym: what polyrhythm and complex rhythm really is means how it works why it's so hard for humans.

417
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:13,229
Scott: Oh now that I see the image on your screen now, I understand why the fuck that problem is.

418
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:14,390
Rym: Yeah Oh good lord.

419
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:20,655
Rym: There's a great video where it shows trying to get a group of people one of them's gonna clap Rhythm a and one of them's gonna.

420
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:21,779
Scott: that's the tiny box.

421
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:26,530
Scott: Yeah polyrhythm be a tiny desk tiny desk Yeah anyway.

422
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,322
Rym: so This but the cool thing is what it shows like.

423
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:42,210
Rym: this is the stuff that I kind of miss when I didn't go into music Like as a profession, but what I used to study it that you think classical music is very like complicated But like popular music people kind of just sing and play unless it's electronic music.

424
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:42,771
Rym: But

425
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:43,593
Scott: even

426
00:24:43,634 --> 00:25:01,250
Rym: a lot of really pot like Zeppelin used polyrhythm more often than you realize like polyrhythm is actually more common in Popular music and rock and metal than it is in like classical or symphonic music Mm-hmm, and it's also in a lot of songs that you wouldn't know unless you were a music person you were listening for it.

427
00:25:02,112 --> 00:25:07,570
Rym: It also shows sometimes people write music naively like really good music, but they didn't study a lot of music theory.

428
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:09,550
Rym: They just write something that sounds good and complicated.

429
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:14,958
Rym: But then if you try to write the sheet music for that You gotta end up writing fucking polyrhythms.

430
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:18,930
Rym: because they made something that cannot be expressed easily the way most music is expressed.

431
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:22,410
Scott: Right because they weren't locked in with that mentality of notes.

432
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:29,815
Scott: They just sort of played whatever with whatever tiring and rhythm and just sort of playing notes and it's like, okay Well now we have to take that.

433
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:36,106
Scott: whatever notes they played, you know off rhythm and there, you know They mess they didn't place that you didn't keep the beat steady.

434
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:40,126
Scott: Yeah, right Okay, well now write exactly what though what they played actually sounds good.

435
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:47,490
Scott: We don't want to change it We don't want to cram it and fit it in the box of four four Oh, we're gonna use a 16 three times signature and right there we go.

436
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:53,590
Scott: We ought to express it using this existing language of written music without inventing a new system that no one will ever understand.

437
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:55,556
Scott: Yep, so we got to do crazy shit.

438
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:58,706
Rym: So this video explains that in change the timing every measure.

439
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:01,449
Rym: Yeah It's way worse than that.

440
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:14,250
Rym: The funny thing is of like random aside if you ever run in like a busker in the street like anyone who's kind of Just like drumming around if you can pick out like natural or intuitive rhythms from polyrhythms or complex rhythms.

441
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:25,148
Rym: That is how to tell if someone actually like has been trained in music or not because very rarely will someone who is just picking out music natively invent this kind of music.

442
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:35,410
Rym: Mmm In the meta moment we are back freshly from PAX South 2020. the video of our panel will be on YouTube like this weekend.

443
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:37,016
Rym: Also, we will link to.

444
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:40,770
Rym: we've linked to video of the other similar panel that talks about 40 different games.

445
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:42,890
Rym: We're linked to the slides from magfest.

446
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:47,010
Rym: We did a panel on the real harm of games and it wasn't just me and Scott talking out of our butts.

447
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:53,070
Rym: We had a doctor sitting next to us who made sure we weren't talking out of our butts and she was fantastic.

448
00:26:53,451 --> 00:27:03,024
Rym: And the slides from that panel with all the citations about how video games aren't bad except in the context probably of Gambling and loot boxes, which probably should be banned.

449
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:07,770
Rym: those slides You can just click here and see the slides and all the citations and read all that research.

450
00:27:08,631 --> 00:27:18,250
Rym: We will be live pretty soon at PAX East 2020. it's like a month away and We'll be doing a repeat panel.

451
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,075
Rym: So if you've seen it before you don't need to see us there at PAX East But it'll be all new to a lot of people.

452
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:27,010
Rym: we were doing take your fucking turn which is a real fun panel to run.

453
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:30,245
Rym: Otherwise the GeekNights book club book is the tale of Genji.

454
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:31,110
Rym: I'm reading through it.

455
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:38,278
Rym: I feel like at some point before the end of the end of like the first quarter of the year We'll do a checkpoint episode on the tale of Genji.

456
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:38,699
Rym: Mm-hmm.

457
00:27:39,342 --> 00:27:41,469
Rym: I got some things to say about Genji.

458
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:43,846
Rym: Yeah, so leave it at that.

459
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:49,990
Rym: So when I was a kid, I uh, I liked Batman but I didn't read Batman comics.

460
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:55,390
Scott: Well, I mean so like I never read a Batman before you talk about before you talk about Batman, right?

461
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,389
Scott: I just got to say I we just look to make sure we never did a show on this and we're surprised We hadn't done a show on it.

462
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:05,394
Scott: But I think what we did do is maybe we did a show on like Cartoons.

463
00:28:05,414 --> 00:28:07,870
Scott: we watched when we were a kid and talked about this extensively.

464
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:11,905
Scott: There is no way we have never mentioned this on GeekNights before at best.

465
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:13,370
Rym: We probably did like cartoons.

466
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,239
Rym: We liked in middle school something like that.

467
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,390
Scott: Anyway, this show is worthy of its own episode.

468
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:23,189
Scott: So yeah when I was a kid much like Rym, I didn't buy a Batman comic, but I watched the Batman movie.

469
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:25,534
Rym: and Which one Michael Keaton?

470
00:28:26,016 --> 00:28:26,236
Rym: Yeah.

471
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:26,577
Rym: Yeah.

472
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:33,905
Scott: Well all the ones I think all the ones that came out during my the 90s Yeah, right, but the only ones I liked were the two Michael Keaton one.

473
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:34,949
Scott: I like the Jim Carrey one.

474
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:45,302
Scott: Okay, anyway, okay And the point is right did not is like the the one with Robin No, or the Arnold Schwarzenegger one.

475
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:45,644
Rym: Yeah.

476
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:51,830
Scott: Yeah anyway The point is that you know, we ever get me kind of like that movie.

477
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,099
Scott: You say what are your favorite things?

478
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,329
Scott: Batman would never make the list?

479
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,255
Rym: It was weird though because I liked Batman.

480
00:28:56,295 --> 00:29:00,130
Rym: I knew what Batman was, but I never consumed any Batman media.

481
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,360
Rym: It's like until I saw Michael Keaton.

482
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,549
Scott: Oh, I watched Adam West Batman before I watched this.

483
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,650
Rym: Oh, I did see Adam West Batman, but I didn't my kid brain like that.

484
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,650
Rym: I always treated that as a different Batman.

485
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,745
Scott: Well, yeah, but the point is is that it was one of those things where it's like.

486
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:14,810
Scott: I like this thing.

487
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:16,192
Scott: I watched this thing.

488
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:19,779
Scott: I didn't read Batman comics, but you know, I've read spider-man's or other things.

489
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,500
Rym: I read x-men's.

490
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:21,733
Scott: I wouldn't.

491
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:25,389
Scott: if you ask me things that I liked it would never occur to me to mention it.

492
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,610
Rym: You know, I would mention Batman.

493
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:27,192
Scott: I would never.

494
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:31,229
Scott: if I went to the Toys R Us to buy toys, I would never buy a Batman thing.

495
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,985
Rym: Well people ask me what superhero things I liked.

496
00:29:34,025 --> 00:29:34,206
Rym: I would.

497
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:34,850
Rym: I was a little kid.

498
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,947
Rym: I would always say I like x-men and Batman like x-men and spider-man.

499
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:42,789
Scott: Yep Batman I wouldn't mention it.

500
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:52,035
Scott: But I sure as hell if Adam West Batman was on TV when I was a kid I would watch it and not want to stop watching it though one thing as a little kid It's totally inside.

501
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:53,040
Rym: but Adam West Batman.

502
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,879
Rym: when I saw the movie Much like with the project a co as a kid.

503
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,766
Rym: I treated like a serious movie.

504
00:29:59,786 --> 00:30:00,890
Rym: I was like, oh shit that bomb.

505
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:01,592
Rym: Oh, no.

506
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:02,977
Rym: Oh, no, there's nuns.

507
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:03,659
Rym: Oh, no.

508
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,200
Rym: Yep.

509
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:05,745
Rym: Like I did not get that.

510
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:06,809
Rym: It was supposed to be a comedy.

511
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:08,678
Scott: Yep Yep kid brain.

512
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:17,630
Scott: anyway point is is that BTS Batman the animated series right was on like constantly on television.

513
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,398
Scott: Yeah in the 90s and basically you get home from school.

514
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,083
Scott: It would be on usually.

515
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:24,370
Scott: it would be on like right before dinner.

516
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,098
Rym: Yeah, I would I watched.

517
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:28,650
Scott: it'd be like watch BTS BTS and eat food.

518
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:33,002
Rym: I'm sure I've seen all or nearly all episodes of this multiple times.

519
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:35,630
Scott: I'm sure I've seen close to all of them.

520
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:35,892
Rym: Not seen.

521
00:30:35,912 --> 00:30:40,052
Rym: there's 85 episodes Okay.

522
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:44,770
Scott: Yeah, it did get to a point on TV where I was watching syndication and I never was not seeing new episodes.

523
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,861
Scott: Yeah, maybe one I missed but you know, who knows.

524
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:53,600
Scott: anyway, so I would you know Purposefully go out of my way to watch other shows.

525
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:54,282
Scott: Yeah, right.

526
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:55,085
Scott: There were certain shows.

527
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,590
Scott: It's like oh, I gotta see that, right?

528
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:02,741
Scott: That's like, you know, I'm fighting to see those shows and if you ask me what I was into it Those are shows to be at like a Voltron right something like that.

529
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:07,050
Scott: Yeah, but if BTS is on And watched it, right?

530
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,797
Scott: I was a little more be just sort of like.

531
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:09,379
Scott: oh it's on.

532
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,870
Rym: BTS is one of those shows that was in my schedule of.

533
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:12,738
Rym: It's on at this time.

534
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:13,748
Rym: I'm going to watch it.

535
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:16,986
Rym: Or I would set my VCR to record that.

536
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,334
Rym: my own VCR Like.

537
00:31:18,394 --> 00:31:20,889
Rym: I would record it and then watch it later if I couldn't watch it.

538
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:21,511
Scott: He's like.

539
00:31:21,652 --> 00:31:24,300
Scott: I would watch it if it was on but it wasn't like.

540
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:27,770
Scott: must watch right, but it's sort of like in hindsight.

541
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,553
Scott: I like.

542
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:32,570
Scott: I didn't realize how much I liked it just like every other Batman thing.

543
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:37,750
Scott: I liked it so much without the self-awareness that that was a thing that I was into.

544
00:31:38,352 --> 00:31:42,149
Scott: So I wasn't taking actions to see more of it.

545
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,739
Scott: Right because it wasn't conscious liking.

546
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:47,469
Scott: but when it was there it would entrap me.

547
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:48,333
Rym: But it tried.

548
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:54,398
Scott: only later in life did I realize oh shit that thing was fucking great And I just didn't realize how great it was at the time.

549
00:31:54,518 --> 00:32:00,645
Rym: like I would say that it is the best incarnation of Batman in film or television.

550
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:07,067
Rym: clearly like The the the best Batman movie is Mask of the Phantasm, which is the BTS movie.

551
00:32:07,107 --> 00:32:16,145
Rym: basically yep The best Batman show is BTS and the best Batman comic I guess is comic adaptation of BTS.

552
00:32:16,245 --> 00:32:29,444
Scott: yeah Yeah, but yeah, so this show if you don't know right It was pretty much as far as I can tell the first show to have that Animation style which was then later used on some other shows.

553
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:33,635
Scott: I think there was a Superman that sort of had that.

554
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:38,648
Rym: yep well remember well a bunch of the show was outsourced to anime studios.

555
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:43,810
Rym: right and Especially watch the first episode again because I never saw the first episode until way later.

556
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:49,061
Rym: But as it like when I was older when we were living in Beacon I just watched the first episode of it randomly.

557
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:56,103
Rym: the first episode of it is some Anime feeling shit like right down to like the banter between characters.

558
00:32:56,444 --> 00:32:58,248
Rym: it feels so much like a 90s anime.

559
00:32:59,472 --> 00:33:03,890
Rym: But they outsourced a whole bunch of the animation to a bunch of studios including sunrise.

560
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:05,377
Rym: There's a whole list of them.

561
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:07,109
Rym: you can read Wikipedia about that kind of stuff.

562
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:12,511
Scott: Yeah, but if you look like you know the main guys are like Bruce Timm Paul Dini Whatever.

563
00:33:12,552 --> 00:33:17,350
Scott: Bruce Timm is like the guy who was credited with like that art character design.

564
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,181
Scott: Yeah, right, and if you look at the other stuff.

565
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:24,485
Scott: He worked on like if you look for him It'll be like oh look a whole bunch of other stuff that looks like you know.

566
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:28,810
Rym: BTS yep But why do we like this Batman so much like if we had to go a really high one?

567
00:33:29,613 --> 00:33:33,710
Rym: It isn't like the grim dark modern Batman that no one.

568
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:42,982
Scott: But it was set in a you know retro future Visually dark right art deco Gotham City.

569
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:49,942
Rym: now listen if there's things I like on this earth It's visually dark film noir style art deco like.

570
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:55,156
Scott: it's already my jam right much Much like animes right?

571
00:33:55,396 --> 00:34:00,613
Scott: it did not you know Talk down to children and that did not dumb itself down.

572
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:01,156
Scott: it you know.

573
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:03,005
Rym: it was like yeah I'll be like it would.

574
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:10,420
Rym: it wouldn't like a lot of people wouldn't get killed outright They just get poisoned or something, but it was still pretty dark, and there was a threat of death, right?

575
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,204
Scott: It was still like an appropriate.

576
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:17,217
Scott: You know for children's cartoon thing, but you know the storytelling wasn't?

577
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:17,737
Scott: you know like?

578
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,712
Scott: lame-o Kind of storytelling like you know Golden Age comic.

579
00:34:22,732 --> 00:34:25,542
Rym: there were a lot of twists there were ambiguous Characters.

580
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:30,478
Rym: most of the villains in BTS were sympathetic like most of them.

581
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:32,811
Scott: If you look at like you know.

582
00:34:32,891 --> 00:34:44,534
Scott: for if you look for another show Right that had the same kind of storytelling going on you don't see them really come until you know like a generation After with like say a samurai jack or something like that.

583
00:34:44,755 --> 00:34:50,974
Scott: yeah in terms of American You know kids TV shows with that kind of storytelling also had a lot of multi-episode arcs.

584
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,260
Rym: it also built upon itself as time went up.

585
00:34:53,661 --> 00:35:03,720
Scott: It introduced characters to Batman's canon yep and many existing Batman characters who appeared were Significantly different and you know because they were new renditions.

586
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,744
Scott: Yeah, it was almost like.

587
00:35:05,005 --> 00:35:16,099
Scott: not only were there new characters like Harley Quinn or whatever, but there were also remixes of existing characters that were sometimes Close to or nothing like the you know previous ones.

588
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:20,354
Rym: This is my favorite Joker by far - yeah, it was just you know.

589
00:35:20,374 --> 00:35:21,237
Scott: It's just a crazy dude.

590
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:22,080
Rym: How's the Mark Hamill?

591
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:30,958
Rym: Though Nowadays like poison ivy was right and Batman was wrong to stop her and almost everything she tried to do.

592
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:43,429
Scott: yeah Also, you know because it was a cartoon There was a more sort of like You know sort of supernatural Superpowered element cuz Batman doesn't have superpowers right now.

593
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:51,612
Scott: his superpower in this show is money and being smart right but a lot of the villains Right if you want if you need a DC comic especially like say a Justice League.

594
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:54,020
Scott: right the superpower people everywhere, right?

595
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,113
Scott: You know it's ridiculous, but the ones in BTAS were all more.

596
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,060
Scott: You know not outright.

597
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,582
Scott: There was like.

598
00:36:00,622 --> 00:36:02,549
Scott: Superman doesn't show up in BTAS right.

599
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,975
Scott: It's not in DC Universe.

600
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:06,884
Rym: It's Batman only yeah Which is so hard why it's great.

601
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:10,073
Scott: so when the villains have some kind of super thing going on.

602
00:36:10,153 --> 00:36:14,728
Scott: It's usually actually more of a sci-fi Kind of deal right?

603
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:15,009
Scott: wasn't?

604
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:15,210
Scott: like?

605
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:21,940
Scott: I don't freeze science accident right I was in clay face also some kind of science thing yeah to face accident.

606
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,100
Scott: Not that I know the real stories behind those in the quote canon stories of the original characters.

607
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,773
Rym: Yeah, right, but then like Harley Quinn brand new character.

608
00:36:30,195 --> 00:36:31,681
Scott: Yep, but yeah There wasn't.

609
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:38,799
Scott: you know a lot of any super powered people with like you know DC style Superman superpower that I remember.

610
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,255
Rym: right There were some moments that edged into that.

611
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:48,375
Scott: but usually There was definitely fantastical Non-real elements yeah, but most of it was sci-fi like the most memorable.

612
00:36:48,817 --> 00:36:55,062
Scott: there are two episodes I remember the most even this far late in my life when I haven't seen this show in forever Right.

613
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:58,535
Scott: one of them was the one where Batman fights the ninja and the volcano.

614
00:36:59,277 --> 00:36:59,859
Scott: you remember that one?

615
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:05,779
Scott: yeah Batman is praise and it was clearly an homage to likes old kung fu movies, right?

616
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,365
Scott: It's like a lot of men is practicing like the touch of death on this dummy Oh my god.

617
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:12,677
Rym: in his hotel room, and then he puts the armor played.

618
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:16,280
Rym: yeah I remember I would I was the kid I remember that episode and he got hit with the touch.

619
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:18,188
Rym: I was like oh shit Batman's dead.

620
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,614
Rym: I was like really yes.

621
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:25,599
Scott: He's fighting this ninja guy Hey on who's like volcano rocks right it likes floating in lava or whatever.

622
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:38,540
Rym: But it also the show was really kind of brooding and atmospheric and I had a lot of like long Establishing shots and just like slow movement, and I did a lot of the things that I liked in anime at the time.

623
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:41,893
Scott: The other episode that I remember at our deck two part.

624
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:42,295
Scott: Oh of course.

625
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:42,717
Scott: It's hard.

626
00:37:42,737 --> 00:37:43,179
Scott: Yeah, of course.

627
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,396
Rym: It's hard I know you right.

628
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:56,576
Scott: It's all about the this giant evil computer That's so big and is a lot like a giant vacuum tube computer But it actually is so powerful has an AI a real AI right and the computer can't even fucking move.

629
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:57,699
Scott: It's just a giant computer.

630
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:04,440
Scott: It's sort of like the computer in Evangelion right or the three computers in the Evangelion if they were just one computer yep, right?

631
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,539
Scott: And somehow that's a villain in a Batman series, and it makes sense.

632
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:13,343
Scott: That's a good set up, and then I think it was actually a set of episodes That was like a sequel.

633
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:16,013
Scott: cuz Hardak was such a good good good idea.

634
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:17,800
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I came back.

635
00:38:18,302 --> 00:38:19,989
Rym: I feel like I gotta rewatch the show.

636
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:22,800
Rym: just cuz I haven't seen most of these episodes since I was in like middle school.

637
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:24,627
Scott: Yeah, of course.

638
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:26,154
Scott: You know the song right.

639
00:38:26,214 --> 00:38:27,479
Scott: That's the Batman song.

640
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,182
Scott: yep It wasn't.

641
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:30,289
Scott: it wasn't originally the Batman song.

642
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:36,500
Scott: right if you could play that song for someone on the street Who's never seen the show and say oh, what's this song?

643
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,544
Scott: They're like oh, it's Batman.

644
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:40,017
Scott: so I'm kind of like gee I wonder where the hell that came from?

645
00:38:40,037 --> 00:38:41,503
Scott: yep This show.

646
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:42,185
Scott: it didn't exist.

647
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:43,027
Scott: before this show.

648
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:44,331
Rym: there's two Batman songs.

649
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:45,715
Rym: There's the silly one and this one.

650
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:47,180
Rym: there's one spider-man song.

651
00:38:47,301 --> 00:39:00,380
Rym: Yeah, the Batman song before this one That used to be the Batman song and all this show came around like if I was walking in the street And I heard you something that even just was the chord structure of the Batman song my brain would just say Batman.

652
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:01,824
Rym: Yeah, where's Batman?

653
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:03,508
Rym: that's right this Batman coming on.

654
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:10,388
Rym: so the music was originally to Danny Elfman because that is who did the Tim Burton Michael Keaton.

655
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,316
Rym: people are giving me shit on the stream.

656
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:13,360
Scott: well cuz they this came.

657
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,388
Rym: I don't call them the Tim Burton Batman movies.

658
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:17,215
Rym: I called him the Michael Keaton Batman movies.

659
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:23,458
Scott: anyway the point is yeah But I mean this was made around the same time as those right when did the first episode of B test came out?

660
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:24,662
Scott: 92 Right.

661
00:39:24,722 --> 00:39:33,230
Scott: so at the time the Batman that was most in people's minds was the Tim Burton Batman Which was also a pretty good bet like and this came out.

662
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:34,194
Scott: this was okay though.

663
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:36,422
Scott: kids went to the movie to see Tim Burton Batman.

664
00:39:36,663 --> 00:39:37,486
Scott: we got to have.

665
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:40,579
Scott: this is the cartoon has got to be close to that feel right.

666
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:42,705
Scott: So that's why you got that.

667
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:46,080
Rym: yep, but it's if I have this anecdote.

668
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,028
Rym: I just remember when I was a kid because my parents when the Michael Keaton Batman movie was out my parents were like I don't Know if this is okay for the kids to see like.

669
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:53,933
Rym: we should check it out.

670
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,280
Rym: so my dad went to see it.

671
00:39:56,523 --> 00:39:59,603
Rym: He came home, and I remember my mom was like so uh How was it?

672
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:03,798
Rym: and he was like it was dark and which makes sense, and she was like who?

673
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:09,603
Rym: really well What if he was the kids like no no no like it's dark, but also like it's actually dark like I couldn't see a lot Of what was going on.

674
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:10,808
Scott: yeah, it was dark.

675
00:40:10,928 --> 00:40:11,390
Rym: It was super.

676
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:13,700
Rym: It was directly dark and metaphorically dark.

677
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:15,206
Scott: It's like when you watch B test.

678
00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:16,451
Scott: It's like it's always night.

679
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:18,720
Scott: It's basically rarely ever is Batman.

680
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:26,191
Scott: I mean it happened sometimes, but rarely is Batman or any scene out in the sunlight during the day Maybe like at the end of an episode.

681
00:40:26,211 --> 00:40:27,660
Scott: It'll be like ah daylight to be like that.

682
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:34,527
Scott: And you know the episodes over but most of the time they're either in a cave in a dark building Out in a dark street.

683
00:40:34,627 --> 00:40:35,872
Scott: It's just dark all the time.

684
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,740
Scott: You know and everything around is dark.

685
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,298
Scott: There aren't brightly colored flowers or anything except for contrast yep.

686
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,180
Rym: So overall like this show holds up crazy.

687
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:50,573
Rym: Well like if it came out today It would get a claim like it was.

688
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:55,153
Rym: this was like Batman the animated series coming to Netflix, and it never existed before.

689
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,237
Rym: and you'd like none of that.

690
00:40:56,317 --> 00:40:57,080
Rym: none of this existed.

691
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,734
Rym: I think it would be one of the top shows right also.

692
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:05,932
Scott: It's like you look at other You know adaptations of things into kids cartoon.

693
00:41:05,952 --> 00:41:17,420
Scott: You know and it's like they tend to do every other superhero Cartoon that I can think of that was a dad different comic book like there isn't a good spider-man cartoon.

694
00:41:17,702 --> 00:41:18,468
Rym: No like.

695
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:20,039
Scott: is there a good Superman cartoon?

696
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:20,546
Scott: It's like.

697
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:25,919
Rym: I don't think there is the one Like this, but I remember watching a couple episodes and just not being in.

698
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:30,053
Scott: yeah Even the other Batman cartoons like there's a Batman Beyond and stuff like that.

699
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:30,475
Scott: It's like.

700
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:31,920
Scott: there's so many of them.

701
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,940
Scott: I think there's like maybe like a Justice League cartoon.

702
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,603
Scott: I don't fucking know.

703
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:37,173
Rym: there is one good x-men cartoon not the Fox one.

704
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:38,720
Rym: that one was only good when I was a dumb kid.

705
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:40,084
Rym: Not actually good.

706
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:44,339
Rym: the point is there's so many but Wolverine in the x-men was actually like legit.

707
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:48,615
Scott: good All right, there are many that are you know good or not so good, but there's none.

708
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:49,920
Scott: even close to this level.

709
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,560
Scott: This is like an extreme level of greatness that is like not been replicated ever.

710
00:41:56,021 --> 00:41:59,953
Rym: Beach-ass is the goat Batman like for real like.

711
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:01,739
Scott: there might be an argument to even say like.

712
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:06,132
Scott: would Batman even be a popular thing today?

713
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:14,260
Scott: if be if not for these this cartoon I can it did Batman like have not been continued would not have carried its popularity forward.

714
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,966
Rym: Yep, I feel like if beat as had not existed as a kid I would have.

715
00:42:19,227 --> 00:42:20,838
Rym: Batman would have just been Adam West to me.

716
00:42:21,482 --> 00:42:29,872
Scott: And I think if this had been a crabby cartoon that ended quickly and wasn't Resindicated and re-shone and so great and remembered where would Batman be now?

717
00:42:29,952 --> 00:42:32,660
Scott: would they have gone into that pool again?

718
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,980
Scott: So frequently for all those other movies that carried it through today?

719
00:42:37,381 --> 00:42:39,990
Rym: But most of those movies like not to get on a change about Batman.

720
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:42,760
Rym: most Batman movies aren't that great?

721
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:49,750
Scott: So if it wasn't for this cartoon carrying it forward they weren't making those, you know It's like they made a bad movie and then they made another bad movie.

722
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:52,580
Scott: Well because of this cartoon there were still Batman fans.

723
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,373
Scott: Yeah, it was only those movies and then there was a first bat.

724
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:56,960
Scott: bad movie would have been the end of it.

725
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,804
Rym: I feel like I would.

726
00:42:57,824 --> 00:43:02,525
Rym: Batman would have been Adam West to me and then Michael Keaton and then after Michael Keaton I would have thought Batman was dumb.

727
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:05,959
Rym: then I would have read Frank Miller's comic and they're really into it because that was good.

728
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:14,897
Rym: But then I would have seen that every other Batman after that is just crying to like ouch Grimdark the Frank Miller Batman comic and then I wouldn't have been into it.

729
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:26,060
Rym: Mm-hmm So B TAS is the greatest Batman has ever been and possibly the greatest Batman ever will be And I feel like we shouldn't talk about mask of the phantasm because that deserves its own like.

730
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:27,105
Scott: Maybe that is the.

731
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,674
Scott: maybe we did do an episode of Master.

732
00:43:28,714 --> 00:43:29,779
Rym: the Phantom couldn't find it.

733
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,062
Rym: I got.

734
00:43:30,082 --> 00:43:32,180
Rym: I'm gonna look for I'm gonna feel like we definitely did.

735
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:37,535
Scott: Anyway, the point is, you know Batman is a character was like reinvented several times right?

736
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:54,540
Scott: is the original detective II Batman Right, then you get the sort of Cartoony Silver Age Batman that you see in comics and also Adam West show Right, and then you get the Neil Adams Batman right who then gets even darker into the Frank Miller Batman, right?

737
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:01,500
Scott: That man has been redone in different ways so many times Right, and it is still being redone.

738
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:07,220
Scott: But you know those first few redoings were like major redoings, right?

739
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:22,691
Scott: It was like they were trying to find what Batman should be and they sort of fell on deciding like okay Batman is like extra dark somewhere right James Bond sort of but also You know really creepy and messed up.

740
00:44:23,475 --> 00:44:35,156
Scott: It's somewhere in there Yeah, and that they sort of Batman I feel like has stayed in this one spot for a long time And hasn't moved a bunch and I would really like to see another Batman redoing, right?

741
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:40,916
Scott: So it needs a new Take that's as wildly different from the current take as the.

742
00:44:41,237 --> 00:44:51,814
Rym: you know Adam West take was from the V test and there is precedent for that because spider-man into the spider-verse I Think is the best spider-man movie ever made.

743
00:44:51,894 --> 00:44:53,020
Rym: bar none Oh movie.

744
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,415
Scott: Yeah, sure show thing is spider-man has actually lots of great spider-man coming.

745
00:44:57,455 --> 00:45:04,920
Rym: Yeah comics are more complex But other than comics I think the hint of the spider-verse is the best non comic spider-man that has ever been made.

746
00:45:05,582 --> 00:45:11,400
Scott: I mean any any video or TV because there's a lot of spider-man things but none of them are that great now.

747
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,618
Scott: It's not a good one.

748
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:21,640
Rym: I feel like you can reinvent Batman To get it away from its current state by just making Batman the animated series.

749
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,467
Rym: There's make more in that style.

750
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,471
Rym: don't even change anything.

751
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:24,913
Scott: Oh, it's hard.

752
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:25,575
Scott: It's hard to do.

753
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:31,344
Scott: Yeah, right It's easy to be like I'll make more of the same but they can't and that's why you know This is.

754
00:45:31,404 --> 00:45:33,299
Scott: this is actually something I was thinking of the other day.

755
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,080
Scott: Sort of looking end the show on this crazy thought, right?

756
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,639
Scott: All right, so we've been watching lots and lots of link to the best randomizer, right?

757
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:41,841
Scott: Why?

758
00:45:42,383 --> 00:45:43,448
Scott: why does that really?

759
00:45:43,488 --> 00:45:45,880
Scott: why are people playing these randomizers and keep playing them?

760
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,708
Scott: It's because they want more of a thing.

761
00:45:48,728 --> 00:45:53,584
Rym: Yeah, right if there was a fin advance Wars randomizer That'd be the end of my.

762
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:54,187
Scott: exactly.

763
00:45:54,207 --> 00:46:04,396
Scott: you want more of a thing and they're not making more of that thing right, so we found a way to To use technology to make more of the thing we want right.

764
00:46:04,516 --> 00:46:07,419
Scott: and it's like, you know You go to a restaurant and you eat steak.

765
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:15,628
Scott: Well, you can always eat more steak because it's not like you're eating the exact same experience every time but when you watch a movie It's literally the exact same movie.

766
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,033
Scott: every time you're rewatch B test.

767
00:46:17,053 --> 00:46:21,674
Scott: You're rewatching the same exact thing Pixel by pixel second by second.

768
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:22,780
Scott: it doesn't change at all.

769
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:27,737
Scott: So you run out eventually and it gets old and you can't get more right.

770
00:46:27,777 --> 00:46:31,420
Scott: that randomizer Allows you to get more linked to the past.

771
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,989
Rym: Yeah, lots and lots more but it is diminishing.

772
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:37,000
Scott: return the same way that you don't get bored of eating ice cream.

773
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:43,960
Scott: You won't get bored playing, you know linked to the past randomizer because it's you're freshening it, right?

774
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:44,907
Scott: it's not the same.

775
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:53,991
Scott: every time as Technology advances we should be and the randomizer You should be able to develop right.

776
00:46:54,011 --> 00:47:04,917
Scott: you see lots of things now where it's like aha Used you know machine learning to read a bunch of books and then write a new book in the same style and it's kind of Silly and not there yet, right?

777
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,480
Scott: There will I think in our lives?

778
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:17,218
Scott: You know, you might probably won't get to download our brains into a computer or ghost in the shell or you know travel You know super far in space really fast or anything like that.

779
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:27,837
Scott: but if we survive we should be able to develop a technology that can just spit out B test episodes that are legit and also new.

780
00:47:27,857 --> 00:47:30,822
Rym: I Await that day.

781
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:39,740
Rym: Yeah, this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

788
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:12,798

789
00:48:12,818 --> 00:48:16,190
Rym: are Alan Joyce hiding behind a little just like a dude?

790
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:20,304
Rym: guys art option link a G the thirst for hydrated Ganon Chris mink.

791
00:48:20,384 --> 00:48:26,626
Rym: if my state e.com J band Shawn Yeager Nicholas brand out you hold the Kray to my heart Or to one.

792
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:37,992
Rym: creations started making trouble in my neighborhood Trevor Don't harl Superboy Clinton Walton Ren from New Zealand Ryan parent drew up and Lander Finn Dread Lily Tenebrae Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas on.

793
00:48:38,453 --> 00:48:42,565
Rym: if anything sounds hinky about this episode of GeekNights Like be sure to let me know.

794
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:48,204
Rym: I threw a pretty primitive pipeline together Still playing around with this.

795
00:48:48,264 --> 00:48:50,191
Rym: This is a full digital pipeline.

796
00:48:50,211 --> 00:48:51,556
Rym: I have no analog compression.

797
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:52,820
Rym: No inserts nothing anywhere.

798
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:59,920
Rym: So I'm working from raw Microphone signals and I'm also Setting up some some sidechain stuff.

799
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:13,179
Rym: I got a bus that's doing a more of a standard broadcast limiter and I'm trying to Bring the production time of a new episode of GeekNights down from five minutes to about one minute Not counting the time it takes to record this bit.

800
00:49:13,671 --> 00:49:20,879
Rym: So yeah If anything sounds good bad weird give me some feedback on the audio in Particular and I'm gonna keep tweaking this pipeline and once it's good, we'll be good to go.

801
00:49:21,281 --> 00:49:25,700
Rym: I also want feedback on how the stream sounded if one of us was too loud or quiet or whatever.

802
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:27,084
Rym: Since it's all digital.

803
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:28,869
Rym: I can't rely on the analog compressor.

804
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:29,912
Rym: I used to use for OBS.

805
00:49:30,253 --> 00:49:36,611
Rym: So I'm instead relying on the Kind of limited compression compression feature that is built into OBS.

806
00:49:37,112 --> 00:49:39,358
Rym: But anyway now I leave you with.

807
00:49:48,971 --> 00:49:50,393
Scott: It's October 31st, 2005.

808
00:49:50,393 --> 00:49:53,616
Scott: This is GeekNights with Rym and scope.

809
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:56,480
Scott: Let's do this.

810
00:49:57,525 --> 00:50:01,196
Scott: Leeroy We should probably put leeroy in there whatever.

811
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,243
Scott: Doo doo doo doo.

812
00:50:03,745 --> 00:50:07,840
Scott: No, I got before you start the news like doo doo doo doo doo doo, but not the noise.

813
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,523
Scott: Doo doo me going.

814
00:50:08,544 --> 00:50:10,534
Scott: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

815
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:11,720
Rym: You want to do that originally?

816
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:21,339
Rym: We're gonna have the So, uh, I guess we could do that or I could make that sound.

817
00:50:22,902 --> 00:50:27,394
Scott: I think this copyrighted or patented by whatever news will just make it something else.

818
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:28,196
Rym: It's just Morse code.

819
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:29,580
Rym: We'll make it say something geeky.
