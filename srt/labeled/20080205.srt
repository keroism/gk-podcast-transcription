1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,688
Rym: It's Tuesday February 5th.

2
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:12,571
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:17,659
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight Advance wars days of ruin.

4
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:25,147
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:31,789
Rym: Well, it's a super Tuesday.

6
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:36,158
Scott: Yeah, yeah super because parades.

7
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:37,321
Rym: well because I've.

8
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:46,650
Rym: actually the parade was kind of not awesome for me because I get on the Train to go home right and it's full of drunken college kids in Giants jerseys.

9
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:54,650
Rym: The best part is While they were all rowdy and whatever for some reason they seemed really afraid to sit next to people.

10
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:57,630
Rym: So they were all sitting on the floor even though there were plenty of seats.

11
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,075
Rym: They just had to ask people to move over.

12
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:09,284
Rym: that that's so everyone is on the train had nothing to do with those people in particular yeah But I'd like I didn't see a single one of those people Sitting in a seat because they all got to the train at the last minute.

13
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:10,770
Rym: the trainers already full of businessman.

14
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:12,371
Scott: It's.

15
00:01:12,693 --> 00:01:18,010
Scott: uh, they're not so good at training talking to anyone who's not also wearing a uniform.

16
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:27,599
Rym: But despite Scott's complete lack of interest in politics and thus no right to complain when things go to hell No, right to complain.

17
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:28,403
Scott: I vote that's it.

18
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,087
Scott: That's all I can do.

19
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:29,570
Scott: that matters.

20
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,695
Rym: It didn't vote the primary which matters more than the election this time.

21
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,318
Scott: I'm not gonna join a party.

22
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:37,019
Scott: that that's that's Doing something.

23
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:40,400
Scott: I'm having my say by saying I don't think that we should have a party system at all.

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,530
Scott: So I don't I don't participate and I'm independent.

25
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:43,434
Rym: I don't know.

26
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:46,184
Scott: That's kind of saying I should go against my principles to gain power.

27
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,696
Scott: Yes Oh, no, very much.

28
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,405
Rym: So because the principle there is no big deal.

29
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:54,050
Rym: Look I joined the Democratic Party.

30
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,210
Rym: It's all about principle.

31
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,375
Scott: That's what democracy is about.

32
00:01:56,456 --> 00:02:02,521
Scott: everyone follows their principle and thus with the most popular Principle is the one that wins out if everyone goes against their principle.

33
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,990
Scott: That's why we're entrenched in the stupid two-party system.

34
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,784
Scott: We're always voting for the worst of the world.

35
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:07,510
Rym: I don't think that's it.

36
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,142
Rym: I think that a lot of people who vote don't have any principles to begin with.

37
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:11,690
Scott: that is also the problem.

38
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,479
Rym: I think the primary problem is single-issue voters.

39
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:15,563
Scott: that too.

40
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:17,410
Scott: But anyway a lot of problems.

41
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,016
Rym: This is my Super Bowl today.

42
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,364
Rym: Scott had his Super Bowl on Sunday, but tonight is my.

43
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,552
Scott: I don't think I understand the Super Bowl.

44
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:26,402
Scott: the real one lasts for 365 days.

45
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,954
Scott: Aha, uh-huh.

46
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:33,228
Rym: You're not gonna be talking about the Super Bowl a month from now.

47
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,169
Scott: Giants will remain world champions until the next Super Bowl and maybe even then if they win again, it could be even longer.

48
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:47,830
Rym: but in much more important news, I uh, I We're gonna talk about this a lot more later in the episode there in the show.

49
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,297
Rym: But I beat advanced wars on the train this morning.

50
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:50,739
Rym: Finally.

51
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:53,146
Scott: Mm-hmm pretty much advanced or is ds2.

52
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:58,350
Scott: Yes One finally Wow, I beat that game long time ago.

53
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,515
Rym: I don't even know where my copy is.

54
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:04,819
Rym: once they got an S in every single mission in the hard campaign and the war room I just kind of stopped playing that one.

55
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:05,482
Scott: I got mine.

56
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:06,730
Scott: I got all my games.

57
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,131
Scott: I never.

58
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:08,597
Scott: I never lose a game except one.

59
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:10,463
Rym: I got him but they're in a box somewhere.

60
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:14,497
Rym: No, but uh I was kind of disappointed in.

61
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:20,159
Rym: I mean in one hand the game was great and it's much more of a war game But at the other hand I was sad.

62
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,470
Scott: why are you using up the main bit in the open event?

63
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,770
Scott: I got to do that.

64
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:30,721
Rym: I was saddened by the fact that with the exception of one mission The game was easy to the point of being laughable.

65
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:32,688
Scott: The game is pretty easy every mission.

66
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:42,237
Scott: so far I mean I didn't beat it yet just because you know lack of playing and I'm in mission 20-something and Every mission so far except for this one team mission Which I sort of gave up on.

67
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:44,650
Rym: but I'll go back the one that Alex and I both beat in one.

68
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,361
Scott: No, I beat that one the one with the bikes and whatever.

69
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:48,687
Rym: Well, yeah, that one's easy.

70
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:49,510
Scott: It's a different one.

71
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,777
Scott: I just haven't really tried it but any mission I've actually really tried to win I've beaten pretty handily.

72
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:59,990
Rym: the thing is that last mission is a fucker and it took me a bunch of tries.

73
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:08,510
Rym: but at the same time That last mission wasn't even like a fifth as difficult as the last mission in the hard campaign of the first two advanced wars.

74
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,290
Scott: No, the first two all because I think it's a different kind of game and I'm saving all my talking for the real main bit.

75
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:17,089
Rym: So we don't waste it all now, but suffice to say I beat the game.

76
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:20,952
Scott: Yeah, suffice to say everyone says if I say what I do Yeah, I'm doing that.

77
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:22,962
Rym: suffice to say I also have some news.

78
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:24,609
Rym: The news is not related to video games.

79
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:34,066
Rym: But so this kind of fell off my radar because I Pretty much gave up on Dungeons & Dragons right about when 3.5 edition came out.

80
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:42,050
Rym: Yeah, something like that, which was coincidentally around the time when I started really learning more and more about burning wheel.

81
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:43,270
Scott: Now that is a coincidence.

82
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,789
Rym: But really the thing was it's not like I found burning wheel and I suddenly hated D&D.

83
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,087
Rym: It was more than I kind of always hated D&D.

84
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,236
Scott: Yeah, I also kind of always.

85
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,570
Scott: but at the same time parts of D&D were great and parts were not so great.

86
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:09,185
Rym: I guess it was just that I was always vaguely dissatisfied with Dungeons & Dragons and most other role-playing systems I played and I never really was sure why I always think whatever.

87
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,210
Rym: I just gloss over it.

88
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,790
Scott: I think the most D&D players are always dissatisfied.

89
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:18,090
Scott: That's why they're always coming up with house rules and changing things and trying to buy more books to get different rules.

90
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:19,375
Scott: I think people are.

91
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:25,650
Scott: it's a game where people really want to play it for certain aspects But they're constantly dissatisfied with it And you know.

92
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,870
Scott: That's why they just keep trying to change it or fix it or do something different and but no one ever thinks play different game.

93
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,119
Scott: That's as you know, like burning wheel.

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,690
Rym: Well, I think part of it's the one D&D has such a mind-share.

95
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,050
Rym: I mean Dungeons & Dragons is the role-playing game.

96
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,770
Rym: I mean god today we've been playing burning wheel for a long tabletop role-playing game.

97
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:55,087
Rym: We've been playing burning wheel for a long time now relative to how long we played other games years, but at the same time When we invite everyone over or we talk about our most recent gaming session we still call it D&D.

98
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:57,900
Rym: Yeah, it's like yeah, we're playing D&D this weekend.

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,869
Rym: We haven't played D&D in a long time.

100
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,436
Scott: They have played D&D like three years.

101
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:02,942
Rym: That's just how much mine.

102
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:03,644
Scott: Oh, no way.

103
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:04,869
Scott: Yes, we have but we haven't.

104
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,897
Rym: Yeah, well, there was the online game, right?

105
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:07,358
Scott: Right, right.

106
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,366
Rym: Yeah that I was not really in.

107
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:10,490
Scott: no not so much.

108
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,243
Rym: That's how my game kind of sucked.

109
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:18,030
Rym: Yeah, okay Oh you admit because I remember I got a lot of flack when I complained about that game on a daily basis.

110
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,230
Scott: Okay, it wasn't like a terrible game.

111
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:20,740
Scott: I just a yeah.

112
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,092
Rym: Well, I think part of it was that most of the fun of D&D was taken away by playing it in a forum something like That.

113
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:27,910
Scott: I'm not big on the forum games.

114
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,216
Scott: I think the forum games are just sort of like.

115
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:39,025
Scott: they provide like one fraction of the experience of real tabletop role-playing but it's you know when a man in the desert will go to.

116
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,770
Rym: Yeah, actually, I think forum role-playing is really great.

117
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,610
Rym: The problem is you can't play forum role-playing with D&D rules.

118
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:51,149
Scott: I don't think any sort of rules will work so well.

119
00:06:51,431 --> 00:07:00,609
Rym: Well, you what you use is you use some of those dice lists or really really simple conflict resolution rules And you pretty much just take turns kind of taking control of the narrative.

120
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:03,279
Scott: Yeah, but that's not really a tabletop role-playing game.

121
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:06,390
Scott: That's more of a a role-playing collaborative storytelling.

122
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,127
Scott: You could just set up a wiki and write a novel together.

123
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:09,650
Rym: There's a fine.

124
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,450
Rym: I mean, there's this long gradient between one end of the role-playing spectrum, which is just playing roles.

125
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:19,362
Rym: You just act it's collective storytelling and nothing more.

126
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:26,790
Rym: and on the other end is We're basically iterating through a video game that we have written the rules for and then are playing in the real world with miniatures.

127
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:32,590
Scott: Yep, I think the the the funness for geeks at least is getting both at the same time.

128
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:41,930
Scott: And I think you know in a forum It's at least without some sort of you know software built into the forum to aid with the game side of things.

129
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:45,529
Scott: You really can only do the story kind of things.

130
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:53,739
Rym: But the news here is that Dungeons & Dragons fourth edition isn't out yet But they've released for $20 each.

131
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:54,421
Rym: I hear $20.

132
00:07:54,421 --> 00:08:00,623
Scott: It's the cost of the players handbook to Preview books, right?

133
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:08,770
Scott: So it's a Pre-play not yet complete players handbook as a beta players handbook if you will for the price of a player's handbook.

134
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:11,679
Rym: See, I'm not entirely sure what this is.

135
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,890
Rym: The review is basically fluff garbage on slash shot.

136
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,576
Rym: It doesn't really say anything useful.

137
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:18,263
Rym: The comments are a lot more informative.

138
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:24,705
Rym: I suggest you read those but Now that there's a lot more details about what exactly fourth edition entails.

139
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,010
Rym: I want to point out a couple of things.

140
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,517
Rym: One actually, you know what?

141
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:38,346
Rym: I don't need to say anything because I'm looking at a slash shot here and Mongoose disciple said better than I could ever say everything I have to say about D&D fourth edition quotes.

142
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:54,530
Rym: Am I the only one who feels that they may have simplified the most important and interesting parts clear out of the game Filled the gaps liberally with World of Warcraft and ended up with a game that admittedly has a much lower barrier to entry But is also not particularly interesting?

143
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:57,795
Rym: Yeah The rule.

144
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,267
Rym: it seems like just a lot of people now.

145
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:14,783
Rym: granted This is a very qualified statement But I know there are a lot of people who prefer like good old advanced Dungeons & Dragons second edition to third edition or modern D&D iterations and there's some truth to that and there's some kind of fudge into that.

146
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:23,279
Rym: but I think the main reason people feel that is That because the system was less evolved and kind of crappy and very vague People were kind of forced to play it by ear.

147
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:32,448
Rym: so as a result good dungeon masters who's run fantastic games It seems like to deal with the problems of Dungeons & Dragons as they have seen them in third edition and 3.5th edition.

148
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:45,589
Rym: They're just making more and more tight video gamey rules and they're working more and more to balance all the classes as opposed to adding interesting role-playing elements.

149
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:51,387
Scott: Because most people they wonder, you know people always like well, how do I roleplay?

150
00:09:51,407 --> 00:10:00,896
Scott: but you know I just get the feeling that most people you know Unless you get someone else to bring you in and show you the way Even you know role-playing.

151
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:05,050
Scott: you don't know from that most and most people even if they do know from that they don't want that.

152
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:06,560
Rym: Well, I'm reading these comments.

153
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,608
Rym: a lot of people are arguing about Oh, well, the power curve is off or the balance is off.

154
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:14,184
Rym: for now This class is too powerful or that class is too powerful or exactly.

155
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:19,204
Scott: That's what most people are looking for Who are into D&D and that's they like, you know what it is.

156
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:20,429
Rym: I don't think that's it.

157
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,690
Rym: Exactly I think it's just a lot of people have never played any game.

158
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,765
Rym: But D&D and I think GURPS is even a much better system it.

159
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:28,094
Rym: Well, I guess I Number wise it's better.

160
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:32,690
Rym: I guess I should qualify that Dungeons & Dragons is not really a role-playing system.

161
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,657
Rym: I don't think it ever will be.

162
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:42,190
Rym: it's basically now a Miniature a stateful miniatures combat game that is interspersed periodically with flavor text.

163
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:43,999
Scott: Yeah, it sounds about right.

164
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,234
Rym: Yeah, but I don't know.

165
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:53,604
Rym: I remember when third edition came out I About I had a freaking nerdgasm and I bought stood in line to buy those books.

166
00:10:53,685 --> 00:11:00,230
Scott: like the night that they came out I played second edition and let you know my youth, you know, but I never actually owned the book someone else.

167
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,294
Scott: I would use someone else's.

168
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:02,258
Scott: but this day.

169
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:05,009
Rym: I own more second edition D&D books than I own any other.

170
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:10,309
Scott: I know that that goes worked and when I got a college I was like, okay now's the time for some serious D&D.

171
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,967
Scott: I'm in college This is where it can happen.

172
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:16,214
Scott: And I went and people had these third edition books and I was like, whoa I didn't know.

173
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,530
Scott: and I expected to like be going to the game store to get second edition books.

174
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,359
Scott: So nope third edition it was.

175
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,270
Rym: so I went out and bought the books and I remembered Taking that book home the first day and be like attacks of opportunity.

176
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:36,259
Scott: Yeah, yeah It took me how many years they still had to learn all the goddamn stupid rules in that book.

177
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:40,954
Rym: You ever knew the rules to any D&D I did.

178
00:11:40,974 --> 00:11:44,472
Scott: I just never you know Knew him as much as the game started required.

179
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:49,456
Scott: I knew the most basic of rules You you knew and they should have attacked me.

180
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:50,179
Rym: you knew damage.

181
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:53,551
Rym: I attacked the monster that has the most hit points.

182
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:55,458
Rym: That is the biggest threat to me personally.

183
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:59,934
Rym: Yes Exactly that and I roll a search.

184
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:03,133
Rym: Yes Exactly, but I don't know.

185
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:16,489
Rym: I'm so Unexcited about fourth edition like I cannot describe to you like how I read a lot about it in the last I don't know 20 minutes today and Nothing in any way interests me.

186
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:19,700
Rym: It feels like that guy said like World of Warcraft.

187
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:24,254
Scott: How could anything excite you if you have tasted the the caviar?

188
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,140
Scott: Why would the can of sardines excite you?

189
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,640
Rym: In fact, the more I think about it, they're basically turning D&D in a World of Warcraft.

190
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,342
Rym: Look, they've.

191
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:41,120
Rym: they're making the rules so codified and the thing they're focusing on the most seems to be character advancement and the power Curve and the risk/reward curve and the carrots to keep you playing.

192
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,820
Rym: It's basically World of Warcraft that you play with your friends and you have to do all the calculations by hand.

193
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,835
Scott: You know, they have a World of Warcraft tabletop.

194
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:51,812
Rym: I know No, I was trying not to remember.

195
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:53,440
Scott: They also have an EverQuest tabletop game.

196
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:55,580
Rym: I remember when I found out about that.

197
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,119
Rym: I remember I was in a bookstore and I saw it and I didn't believe it was there.

198
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:01,320
Rym: I went to Pete and said Pete look at that and what is it?

199
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,409
Rym: He said I don't know what you're talking about because I don't see anything.

200
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:03,891
Rym: that that's.

201
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:10,460
Scott: that's a role playing has become to Most people is you know, if it's you know, they call it they call like Final Fantasy a role-playing game.

202
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,849
Scott: No, it's not that you don't roll it.

203
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,500
Scott: You don't play any role in Final Fantasy.

204
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,045
Scott: The role is already played for you.

205
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:20,703
Scott: You're just watching a movie interspersed with this, you know numbers game of you know Character stats and but.

206
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:21,365
Rym: but you can make.

207
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:24,715
Rym: in some games you make really important character decisions.

208
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:31,520
Rym: For example up dust out Love me, but thou must Alright.

209
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,755
Rym: so I don't think I'm gonna talk about fourth edition again until it comes out fully.

210
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:40,392
Rym: then I'll probably Buy but I put by in quotes.

211
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:45,929
Rym: cuz I think what I'm gonna do is I mean, I bought the third edition books.

212
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,897
Rym: I even bought a new third edition book not that long ago.

213
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,359
Scott: Me too.

214
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,305
Rym: Sadly Why did we do that?

215
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:52,369
Scott: I had PDFs.

216
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:53,693
Rym: I don't know.

217
00:13:54,075 --> 00:14:02,839
Rym: I will acquire fourth edition I will read it all yes, and then I will write my Unending diatribe and then that'll be the end of it.

218
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:05,885
Scott: Yeah, it would take.

219
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,269
Scott: it would take quite a surprise.

220
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:10,580
Scott: basically we'd have to open up the book and see a pirated copy of burning wheel.

221
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:14,699
Rym: in there It's the churning wheel the churning.

222
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,279
Rym: Okay Seriously, we talked about it a lot.

223
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:27,264
Rym: But if you like role-playing you like to play roles and you like fantasy or you like dune Or you know what.

224
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:30,620
Rym: even if you hate those things, I think burning wheel will make you like them.

225
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,720
Rym: There's no excuse on earth not to buy the core books to burning wheel.

226
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:46,640
Rym: If you have ever two books for the price of the beta D&D books you get a whole game Pretty much if you're a role player a video gamer or even if you're an actor or anything burning wood.

227
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:54,194
Rym: Actually, yeah If I if I was like a teacher in high school and I taught drama I'd make the kids play burning wheel like once a month in class.

228
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:55,760
Scott: I would just have the class B burning wheel.

229
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:57,710
Rym: That's not a bad idea actually.

230
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,092
Rym: Yeah.

231
00:14:58,152 --> 00:14:59,378
Scott: Okay go get a job doing that.

232
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:00,403
Rym: All right Not much.

233
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:01,870
Rym: I want to have a job being a teacher.

234
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:02,996
Scott: Yeah, your time is done.

235
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:03,659
Scott: There we go.

236
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:03,860
Scott: Ready?

237
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,803
Rym: Okay, so what do you got?

238
00:15:04,823 --> 00:15:06,008
Rym: We're gonna tell you I got.

239
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,840
Rym: I got fourth edition D&D that you know How.

240
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:10,807
Rym: you know how much of a disappointment that is.

241
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:15,964
Rym: remember when you heard George Lucas is making new Star Wars movies Whatever.

242
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:24,889
Scott: remember how you felt when you heard that Not as excited as most other people anyway One of rims favorite games ever find a commando.

243
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:32,053
Rym: I can beat that game in like 28 minutes, dude Did you okay?

244
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:35,947
Scott: so They're making a new bionic commando.

245
00:15:35,987 --> 00:15:37,333
Scott: that's all 3d and whatnot.

246
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:37,975
Scott: All right, wait a minute.

247
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,100
Rym: bionic commando.

248
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,023
Rym: I believe you mean Hitler.

249
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:40,867
Rym: no Fukkatsu.

250
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:42,273
Scott: Yeah, hidden no Fukkatsu same game.

251
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:43,457
Scott: They're making a new one.

252
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:43,839
Scott: That's all 3d.

253
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,930
Scott: But that 3d one who knows if it'll be good.

254
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,998
Scott: It'll be bad who what system it'll be on.

255
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:50,640
Scott: I have no idea.

256
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,550
Rym: Well, I think the internet knows.

257
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:54,300
Scott: the internet probably knows I'm not looking it up.

258
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:05,956
Scott: Well, I mean, I think the internet knows based on what you're thinking that or your news is Okay, but anyway the in addition to this 3d game They're also making another bad a commando game called bad.

259
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,742
Scott: a commando Rearmed.

260
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:13,897
Scott: get it rearmed as in re weaponing but also because he has a robotic bionic arm.

261
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:14,860
Scott: He's rearming.

262
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,153
Rym: I've never played bionic commando for the NES.

263
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:19,599
Rym: get yourself a ROM because that.

264
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:20,945
Rym: That is one of those.

265
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:23,656
Scott: get yourself the GBA cartridge that also has contra on it.

266
00:16:23,757 --> 00:16:29,074
Scott: Yes, and Strider has three games on one cartridge, but that game is like one of the.

267
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:30,740
Scott: it is contra right or is it super C?

268
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,301
Scott: That's on there.

269
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:33,127
Rym: It's not contra or super C.

270
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:36,318
Scott: What game is on there this writer bionic commando.

271
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:37,222
Scott: one of the game I don't know.

272
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,910
Rym: I only played bionic commando.

273
00:16:38,971 --> 00:16:40,820
Rym: Oh, yeah, like mighty final fight mighty final fight.

274
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,523
Scott: That's the third one.

275
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,189
Scott: I don't confuse that with contra.

276
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:43,671
Scott: What the fuck?

277
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:44,514
Scott: No, I don't know.

278
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:45,900
Rym: up up down down man.

279
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:53,057
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so they're making this bionic commander rearmed and basically it's the original bionic commando with my.

280
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:54,260
Scott: it's still the same game.

281
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,398
Scott: It's 2d game even though they do sort of like the Smash Brothers thing where you know the 3d models, but it's 2d, right?

282
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:06,231
Scott: but modern graphics and Fixed gameplay cuz as great as bionic commando was.

283
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,700
Scott: the gameplay was not flawless.

284
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,205
Scott: There were many problems.

285
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:11,210
Rym: part of that were due to.

286
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,438
Rym: there was limitations of the NES part of it.

287
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:13,780
Rym: Was that?

288
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,738
Scott: Yeah, yeah, so they basically this this may the boss of the game is basically up fuck up fuck up game over.

289
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:27,371
Scott: Yeah Okay, you know and if you watch this video here that we could link to.

290
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:32,775
Scott: the guy is both the lead creative You know designer of the game and also the composer.

291
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:33,640
Scott: and he did you know?

292
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:43,160
Scott: He did nice quality remixes of all the music for the game and he's also He's pretty Ron target with what was wrong with the original game and how to make it better.

293
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,640
Scott: For example, the original bionic commando, you can choose different weapons, right?

294
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:50,333
Rym: I I point out that there is in fact only one weapon is the bazooka.

295
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:56,480
Scott: every other weapon every other weapons useless Right, so he's gonna and you can only choose the weapon at the beginning of the level.

296
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,560
Scott: You couldn't change it until you start a new level.

297
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:04,102
Scott: so He's gonna make it so you could change the weapons all the time and he's gonna make it so you could do more stuff with The arm.

298
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:09,281
Scott: and also all the boss fights in the game are pretty boring like basically crouch and shoot then go up and shoot You know.

299
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:13,296
Rym: or when you fight captain pip pip pip pip, you just stand behind him.

300
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:14,279
Rym: He can't get you.

301
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:17,639
Scott: You stand behind him and shoot with the bazooka you win, right?

302
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:21,740
Scott: Yeah, so he made all the bosses more interesting.

303
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,160
Scott: We're gonna use the arm to fight the bosses and made the environment a little more interactive.

304
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:30,714
Scott: But in general, you know If you watch videos the game seems to be pretty much intact.

305
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:35,253
Scott: and if I had an Xbox I'd be pretty excited to play this bionic commando rearmed business.

306
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:36,880
Rym: I'm more and more feeling an Xbox.

307
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:40,300
Scott: I mean, it's the only reason one of the I gotta be honest, right?

308
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:49,700
Scott: One of the reasons I don't have the Xbox is because I feel like without the HDTV It's useless because so many of the games if you try to play them on standard-definition TVs just don't work.

309
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:55,240
Scott: You can't read anything on the screen and it just it's the system even the crappy.

310
00:18:55,461 --> 00:19:01,640
Scott: You know arcade games like the pac-man are designed for the HD or the widescreen and we don't have that and it wouldn't work.

311
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:03,988
Rym: Well, we will when we build the geek house.

312
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:09,586
Scott: Yes, when we move if I had it when I move I'll Eventually get the flat screen hang on the wall.

313
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:13,579
Rym: HDTV in an Xbox 360 probably well by then might be the 720 or whatever.

314
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:17,051
Scott: I'll get that sure as long as the backwards compatibility is there.

315
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:19,500
Scott: and mostly all I really need is the live business.

316
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:20,585
Scott: The live is where it's at.

317
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:23,357
Rym: God, I would pay to just have live on Windows.

318
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:24,080
Rym: I even use Windows.

319
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:25,380
Scott: I don't do that.

320
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:25,741
Scott: Why?

321
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:33,524
Scott: there's no technological reason other than they haven't done it yet that I shouldn't be able to do every Xbox live arcade thing On a PC.

322
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:34,768
Scott: I mean sure the gate.

323
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:38,540
Scott: the Xbox games, you know that that you know come out on like a disc.

324
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,080
Rym: You know that for what, you know I'm not excited about any of those games.

325
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,412
Scott: But why can't the games that you download like the Uno with the webcam?

326
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,800
Scott: I could do that with a PC and why not?

327
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,797
Scott: Why haven't they done that?

328
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:54,428
Scott: They could sell Vista low with that because Vista is cheaper.

329
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:58,280
Rym: the Xbox even though I just want to point out don't out there.

330
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,906
Rym: I know a lot of you play that Uno game.

331
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,177
Rym: Don't pretend that Uno involves skill of any kind.

332
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,241
Scott: No, it doesn't Okay.

333
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,051
Scott: So yeah, that's what I got here.

334
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:13,118
Scott: Check this video out and Get excited about bionic commandos, maybe not the 3d one but 2d remake.

335
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:21,249
Rym: good enough things of the day.

336
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:32,729
Rym: So check this this this I like watching people perform stunts and feats of strength But you know, sometimes you watch someone doing something dangerous and you can't go.

337
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:38,327
Rym: Wow, that's amazing because you you feel that sense of one.

338
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:42,327
Rym: if I were there I would probably pee myself and two.

339
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:46,840
Rym: I Like you probably feel like they're about to die at any second.

340
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:47,542
Scott: Mmm.

341
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:49,046
Rym: This is one of those videos up.

342
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:52,135
Rym: Basically these dudes Climbed onto this crane.

343
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:58,590
Rym: that's like at the top of a skyscraper that's being built or something crazy like that All right, and they don't have any safety equipment.

344
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:04,330
Rym: They're just kind of hanging on to this thing Like they got themselves out there and they're looking around like the crane is like an elevator in it, right?

345
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,498
Scott: So they took the elevator up to the little control box

346
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,888
Rym: and then they walked out in like onto the crane like out

347
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:11,690
Scott: like the Part that goes, you know hanging over with the okay

348
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,175
Rym: Yep, and I

349
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,582
Scott: mean you could be on top of it crawling, you know,

350
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:17,950
Rym: yeah, but that's not the exciting part.

351
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,950
Rym: I mean that's scary enough.

352
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:23,659
Rym: I mean I do get a little bit of vertigo if I you know Look over a very sheer cliff or something.

353
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:24,302
Scott: I do too.

354
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,390
Scott: I get the vertigo even though I'm not afraid of the heights.

355
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:29,128
Rym: Yeah, well, it's just your body has that those two feelings.

356
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:41,170
Rym: one There's the normal feeling of you know, if I fall if I sneeze or something, I'll just die Yeah, and then secondary to that there's that somewhat smaller thought of what if I just jump off for some reason?

357
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:46,790
Scott: There's also that sort of inner ear imbalance thing where it's like try sitting on something.

358
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:53,426
Scott: That's like maybe six feet tall like the edge of a high deck and then you know Like lean back a little bit and your body goes.

359
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:56,857
Scott: Whoa You know, it's like no no, no, no, no, no.

360
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:04,740
Scott: and you know looking over something like that your body goes inside it goes Whoa, so these dudes Start doing pull-ups from this thing.

361
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,684
Rym: All right.

362
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:12,050
Scott: Yeah If I was you know strong enough to do pull-ups I would have a little bit of more confidence.

363
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:13,255
Rym: it's not.

364
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:18,480
Rym: I don't think it's a matter of that because Just watching this video made me very uncomfortable.

365
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,030
Rym: But at the same time it's fascinating and I recommend you watch it.

366
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,456
Scott: Yeah, maybe they had hidden safety cables.

367
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,241
Scott: Yeah, they photoshopped them out.

368
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:28,888
Rym: I didn't see anything regardless.

369
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:29,710
Rym: That's my thing.

370
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,696
Scott: Yeah, I'll believe it.

371
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:31,199
Scott: I'll believe it.

372
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:42,110
Scott: All right, so a Lot of you know, I'm sort of anti Collecting if you didn't hear that before in the show at any time, but what about my pile of a silver?

373
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:44,721
Scott: 1930s Liberty Heads, how about your pogs?

374
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:46,310
Rym: I don't have any pogs.

375
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:52,751
Rym: Actually, how about your magic card 19 that I have all my magic cards a 1932?

376
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:55,323
Rym: Silver Liberty Head is one hell of a slammer.

377
00:22:55,343 --> 00:23:09,270
Scott: Let me tell you okay You know, so when it comes to buying things I generally consider What is this useful for right and if something is actually you know useful for looking at you know It's sort of like an important artifact or something.

378
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:16,230
Scott: It should be like a museum and not something you should collect in your house, you know, Oh Scott I see you look up to what's this, Indiana Jones?

379
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,496
Rym: I think wasn't that always his sh*t?

380
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:22,107
Rym: this belongs in a museum and the Nazis said no it belongs.

381
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:23,130
Rym: I don't know we're Nazis.

382
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:25,898
Scott: Okay, I know where that came from.

383
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:26,742
Rym: That was always his thing.

384
00:23:26,762 --> 00:23:28,109
Rym: He's like this belongs in a museum.

385
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:31,450
Rym: Okay, anyway that was like the whole point of the Indiana Jones movies.

386
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:38,636
Scott: I thought the whole point was Indiana Jones doesn't actually do anything Seriously rid is Laura Stark?

387
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:41,849
Scott: if he wasn't there everything's would have gone and got good.

388
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:44,517
Rym: It's not like the Nazis wouldn't have melted.

389
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:45,380
Rym: Yeah.

390
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,205
Scott: I mean the Nazis got the arc.

391
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:48,067
Scott: He lost.

392
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:49,050
Scott: he never saved anyone.

393
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:54,890
Scott: He always he attempted daring rescues and failed at every possible turn and in the end the Nazis ruined themselves.

394
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:58,648
Scott: If Indiana Jones just stayed home in bed everything would have turned out great.

395
00:23:58,668 --> 00:24:02,785
Rym: in the end It didn't matter but he wanted to put everything in a museum.

396
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:03,467
Scott: He did.

397
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:03,849
Scott: Okay.

398
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:08,583
Scott: So Anyway, some guys selling something on eBay and looking at the pictures.

399
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:10,028
Scott: I believe that it is 100% authentic.

400
00:24:11,051 --> 00:24:15,265
Scott: It is the SNES game, but perhaps the most popular SNES game.

401
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:22,950
Scott: chrono trigger Sealed from the factory still with the shrink wrap still in the original box the instruction manuals in there.

402
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:28,947
Scott: It's straight like from the shelf of a toy store, you know stored safely for many years.

403
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:29,649
Scott: Here it is, right?

404
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:37,537
Scott: Okay sells it on eBay and it fetches $1217.

405
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:42,863
Rym: that's Probably about right considering the level of fandom for that game.

406
00:24:43,144 --> 00:24:45,290
Scott: I know but you really think about it.

407
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:50,735
Scott: Wow, this is just what kind of Person.

408
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:53,750
Scott: yeah, you either had to be stupidly rich and just want to piss away money, right?

409
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,392
Rym: the thing is To play devil's advocate.

410
00:24:57,073 --> 00:25:15,258
Rym: if I were stupidly rich and I were really into something like let's say I don't know The go the original gold Zelda NES Unopened in the box also signed by I don't know everyone who worked at Nintendo back then That's not worth anything to me.

411
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,106
Rym: That's worth a couple hundred bucks.

412
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:17,930
Scott: What are you gonna do with it?

413
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:19,658
Rym: I'm gonna put it a display case.

414
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:20,823
Scott: All right, and then what?

415
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:22,370
Rym: and then people can look at it.

416
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:23,540
Rym: I'll have a little museum.

417
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:24,510
Rym: I'll put it in the library.

418
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:25,194
Scott: Why?

419
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:26,624
Rym: because I like to look at the.

420
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:27,490
Scott: but why is that worth?

421
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,853
Scott: $200 for $200.

422
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:31,142
Scott: think about what else you can get for $200.

423
00:25:31,142 --> 00:25:33,592
Scott: if I'm that rings that would actually do Something.

424
00:25:33,772 --> 00:25:35,518
Rym: if I if I'm that rich, it doesn't matter.

425
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,180
Scott: No, it does.

426
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,561
Scott: Okay.

427
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,106
Scott: Anyway, yeah, that's just.

428
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:39,431
Scott: I really think you know What.

429
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:42,170
Scott: what's the first thing gonna do with this for $1,200?

430
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,201
Rym: You're gonna put it on display and go wow check this out.

431
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:45,910
Scott: You could buy like a fucking computer.

432
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,957
Scott: You could buy like a wicked TV.

433
00:25:48,118 --> 00:25:49,322
Rym: get up to add.

434
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:50,306
Rym: That's not that much money.

435
00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:51,310
Rym: You couldn't buy a great TV.

436
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:57,203
Scott: no, you could buy a lot of Opened chrono trigger cartridges and play them.

437
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,390
Scott: You'd actually play the game.

438
00:25:58,551 --> 00:26:01,710
Rym: But what if you already have all those things and you have money and you're a fan of the game?

439
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,997
Scott: You're wasting your money in your moron.

440
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,422
Rym: People are allowed to collect things.

441
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:06,325
Scott: They're allowed to this.

442
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:07,530
Scott: make them not morons.

443
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:09,036
Rym: I don't find any problem with it.

444
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:10,302
Scott: I find a big problem with it.

445
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:14,153
Scott: People are stupid wasting their money on useless shit Uh-huh.

446
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:18,144
Scott: Yeah, you should only spend money on things to do something anything.

447
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:19,970
Scott: any other signature of money is stupid.

448
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:22,502
Rym: Didn't you have some posters on your wall in college?

449
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:23,266
Scott: They do something.

450
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:24,110
Rym: What do they do?

451
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,618
Scott: They cover up the ugly ass wall.

452
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,670
Rym: You mean the beige wall?

453
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,513
Scott: Yeah, and you know what those.

454
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:30,979
Rym: all they are is something to look at.

455
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:31,601
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

456
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:32,926
Scott: They're they're.

457
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,912
Scott: they're free to Pretty free.

458
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:37,198
Scott: No, they're not $1,200.

459
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,782
Scott: They were $1,200 posters over there.

460
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:39,403
Rym: They weren't free.

461
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:40,747
Rym: You could about a stick of gum for that.

462
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:45,685
Rym: Oh So why did you buy something useful instead of some stupid poster?

463
00:26:45,886 --> 00:26:46,629
Scott: poster is useful.

464
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:52,878
Rym: Okay cover up my prison break Or to cover up that hole in the wall in colony.

465
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:56,690
Rym: Yes until the hole became larger than the poster this this.

466
00:26:57,851 --> 00:26:59,860
Scott: What use could this have besides playing it?

467
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,770
Scott: and if your use is playing it, why did you spend $1,200?

468
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:09,921
Rym: Well, I think the answer is that Indiana Jones needs to steal it and put it in a museum and obviously Obviously the person who bought it is in fact a Nazi.

469
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:11,829
Scott: This just shows you how crazy people are.

470
00:27:12,276 --> 00:27:14,233
Rym: so Advance wars.

471
00:27:14,694 --> 00:27:17,362
Scott: Well Advance Wars days of ruin specifically.

472
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:24,743
Rym: Yeah, we're not gonna talk about the whole Advance Wars Franchise even though I could I could talk forever about the Advance Wars franchise.

473
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:29,156
Scott: Well, you know, this also goes back to the Desert commander.

474
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:30,080
Scott: the Famicom Wars.

475
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,098
Scott: as a commander I think is actually a similar game But it's not actually Famicom war regardless.

476
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:36,522
Rym: The game is pretty much identical.

477
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:37,545
Scott: Yeah, it's.

478
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:42,061
Rym: it's a pretty close game And there's also a similar game for the SNES plus.

479
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,390
Scott: we did a show in 0 6 0 7 2 5.

480
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,958
Scott: We talked about Advance Wars series.

481
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,530
Scott: We just you know, now there's a new Advance Wars.

482
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,017
Scott: It's one of our favorite series of games.

483
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:52,430
Scott: So just got talking about the new game and not the old game.

484
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,693
Rym: Yep now now just to.

485
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:59,191
Rym: we've talked about this before but briefly and if you're wondering where we're coming from We're.

486
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:00,497
Rym: we're kind of good at this game.

487
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:04,334
Rym: And by this game, I mean every Advance Wars game we've ever played So far.

488
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:08,310
Scott: they've been to GBA games in the DS game and this is the second DS game, right?

489
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:13,688
Scott: And the first three DS games are all sort of the first three games so far.

490
00:28:13,728 --> 00:28:16,117
Scott: in the US We're all sort of similar, you know, they all.

491
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:19,430
Scott: it was happy times happy cool characters.

492
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:25,740
Rym: It was pretty much yay war war is great war is fun and war really was fun in the Advance Wars world.

493
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:30,316
Scott: everything was green and happy and colorful and All the you know, most of them.

494
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:35,974
Scott: the game also was different in that it was very puzzling as opposed to Tactics II.

495
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:44,989
Scott: I mean there was tactics action going on especially in multiplayer But most of the single-player was puzzling like, you know, how do I do this exact thing here that they needed me to do?

496
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,811
Scott: you know.

497
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:51,594
Scott: and then the right number of turns move the things to the exact right spaces or you know, like a Like a puzzle.

498
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:52,179
Scott: I don't know.

499
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:52,783
Rym: Yep.

500
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:53,649
Rym: I mean pretty much.

501
00:28:54,512 --> 00:29:00,770
Rym: The game was limited in in scope but it was fun and the characters were very memorable and they're all around solid games.

502
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:05,890
Scott: Oh, the other thing about those games is that the the characters, you know had all these crazy powers, right?

503
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,689
Scott: They kept in adding more and more to that as the you know.

504
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:13,690
Scott: The first game they had normal powers and this can give me a little more powers and the third game even more powers, right?

505
00:29:15,074 --> 00:29:15,743
Scott: And they kept.

506
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:21,210
Scott: you know The game really came down to a lot of rock-paper-scissors because the character powers were very strong.

507
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:26,470
Scott: Like if you chose grit you had freaking long range that no one else had.

508
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,434
Scott: So you were the fucking.

509
00:29:27,454 --> 00:29:30,024
Scott: that was a huge crazy advantage.

510
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:32,974
Scott: that really changed the game and there's a lot of rock-paper-scissors.

511
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:40,810
Scott: action and the powers meant a lot and You know, the powers actually often meant more than you know, how you played the game so much.

512
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:47,308
Scott: It's a lot like the dune board game where it's asymmetric Everyone has a different power and they lean on that power with all their might.

513
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:54,926
Rym: now There's actually a lot more to say about that but I guess we just talk about what exactly is different about Advance Wars days of ruin?

514
00:29:54,967 --> 00:30:04,187
Rym: aside from the fact that In terms of story and plot and an atmosphere and mood and everything Advance Wars days of ruin is hardcore.

515
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:09,930
Scott: They took away all the greenness and the happiness and now it is the the gritty hardcore.

516
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:13,444
Scott: This is a serious post-apocalyptic war going on here.

517
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:14,850
Scott: It's fucked up shit.

518
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:16,614
Scott: There's scary shit going on.

519
00:30:16,695 --> 00:30:18,238
Scott: is everyone serious.

520
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,061
Scott: No one's silly.

521
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:19,963
Rym: Well except for dr.

522
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:20,304
Rym: Hibbert.

523
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:31,090
Scott: Sometimes people are silly, but well just dr Hibbert, dr Hibbert, but also if you go and you in any mission you can say, you know Like give me the the strategy for this mission and sometimes there'll be silly stuff going on.

524
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:36,250
Rym: You know I never went in there for the whole game until I got to the last mission after I died three times.

525
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:41,150
Scott: I went in there a few times and I sort of wish I went in there every time not go back and play any mission.

526
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:44,128
Scott: I know not to get the strategy, but just to see the funny shit.

527
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:47,789
Scott: Yeah But yeah It's it's the theme.

528
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:55,690
Scott: Visually and stylistically the game is dead fucking serious as opposed to the previous Advance Wars which is the exact fucking opposite and it hits you right at the beginning.

529
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,566
Rym: I mean you turn on the game the first time and you basically watch this one.

530
00:30:59,586 --> 00:31:01,995
Rym: the music's fantastic But the music really sets a mood.

531
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:02,838
Rym: music's good.

532
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:07,235
Rym: I actually well not that the music during the game is just you know Standard video game.

533
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:09,426
Scott: Yeah, I like the old Advance Wars in the game.

534
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,150
Scott: music much better.

535
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:15,244
Rym: Yeah, but the opening song that plays over the opening video that's pretty good.

536
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:18,454
Scott: it's fantastic that's pretty good song right there I mean it really.

537
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:19,699
Rym: it sounds good.

538
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:22,770
Rym: It's a good song and it really kind of it hits you right over the way.

539
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,350
Rym: It's pretty much Meteors destroyed the world.

540
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:26,581
Rym: Everybody's dead.

541
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:27,489
Rym: have fun.

542
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:32,307
Scott: and even though I don't I like the other advanced the older Advance Wars during the game music better.

543
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:35,358
Scott: the Sound quality of them.

544
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,073
Scott: all the music in this game is fantastic Like you did.

545
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:39,981
Scott: it's amazing that it's coming out of that DS.

546
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,970
Scott: You're like, whoa, that's coming out of DS shit.

547
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:45,039
Rym: I was playing it with my insertion headphones and damn.

548
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:55,370
Rym: Yeah, but in terms of game differences I think the biggest thing is that CEO powers don't work at all like they used to and this pretty much completely changed the game.

549
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,869
Rym: This is probably the single biggest change in the game.

550
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:01,659
Scott: Yet instead of the CEO just slow hat.

551
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:04,810
Scott: first of all in the old game CEOs had a power that was on all the time.

552
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:08,402
Scott: Then they had a little power and then they had a big big power.

553
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:12,361
Scott: and then they in the dia in this first DS One they even had a combo power.

554
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,609
Scott: use two CEOs at once.

555
00:32:14,153 --> 00:32:14,738
Scott: Much.

556
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:22,830
Rym: you charge that up But nominally by doing damage to your opponent, but more importantly by taking damage from your opponent.

557
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,293
Scott: Yeah so you would try to.

558
00:32:24,353 --> 00:32:28,867
Scott: whoever dealt and took the most damage would build up the power and you debt power.

559
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:33,989
Scott: if you used it Properly and strategically you just destroy the other person and then they would use it right back and whoa.

560
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:49,780
Rym: the problem there was basically that you had to really play this metagame of damaging the opponent but not in a realistic war way But in a kind of puzzle game way because if you damage him too much But not to great effect you just charged up their power and got rekt.

561
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:50,763
Rym: You couldn't.

562
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,830
Rym: just well his missiles are too close.

563
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:59,422
Rym: I'm gonna send a battle copper over there to take it out because instead it's I Do that then I'll charge up his power.

564
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:00,729
Rym: I gotta wait.

565
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:03,390
Scott: Now they still have the CEO power.

566
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:10,764
Scott: But the way it works is first of all, you have to get a vehicle to your headquarters Right and you tell a CEO to go in the vehicle what?

567
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,010
Rym: no you do it from any factory.

568
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,417
Scott: Oh any factory also, right.

569
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,535
Rym: and then and I don't think you can do it from that quarters Yeah, I've done it from the headquarter.

570
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:17,816
Scott: Really?

571
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:22,010
Rym: Yes, and I honestly I never used my powers or my people.

572
00:33:22,412 --> 00:33:24,403
Scott: Yeah, I really I don't use them that much either.

573
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:25,469
Scott: I used them a couple times.

574
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:31,773
Scott: you put them in and then the vehicle has a radius around it that you can kind of see and The radius.

575
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:34,562
Scott: any vehicle in that radius gets sort of like any vehicle.

576
00:33:34,582 --> 00:33:37,250
Scott: any unit in that radius gets like a bonus to it.

577
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:46,770
Rym: You know depending on your power I mean All of your ground direct attack units get more attack or all of your air units get more mobile, you know stuff like that.

578
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:59,150
Scott: Yeah So you sort of keep the CEO on the field and anything near the CEO that is affected gets helped out and you can Sort of create this zone of power on the map and that could could be strategically helpful.

579
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:08,510
Scott: It's pretty strong, but it's not like I get two turns or I Do ten damaged all your guys or my battleships shoot everything.

580
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:12,850
Scott: Oh, yeah, my battleships get a range of the entire map and they rain holy death.

581
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:16,873
Rym: Yeah, well Calder's powers kind of unfair But that's obvious.

582
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:22,351
Scott: or I buy everything at half price this turning a double money and can build from any city I own.

583
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,018
Scott: Oh God, that's right.

584
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,404
Rym: Yeah, that's hachi for you.

585
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:37,719
Rym: Yeah, but Beyond that also you'd have a Like a power you can activate and the way you charge it up is by doing damage with vehicles with it Like within your CEO zone of power.

586
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:44,272
Rym: Yep, and if your CEOs unit dies You don't lose or anything but all the power you've built up gone and the CEO.

587
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:47,326
Scott: you got to put him in a new vehicle if you want to and you have to pay money.

588
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:57,433
Rym: so they've really toned that down and coupled with that they've added at units to the game and fundamentally changed the way a lot of units play and All the.

589
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:02,150
Rym: the effect of all this is that this is not a puzzle game nearly so much as any other advance.

590
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,860
Scott: There is some puzzle missions in there.

591
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:09,784
Scott: in the war room in the team missions There's a few puzzles to play but it is not a puzzle game anymore at all.

592
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,690
Scott: It is definitely now a war game.

593
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:17,658
Rym: It's not like a Advance Wars DS Destroy the battleships in nine days.

594
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,303
Scott: I hated that one the most.

595
00:35:19,344 --> 00:35:21,310
Scott: that was the worst mission in any advances ever.

596
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:23,030
Rym: I beat it with an S in my second try.

597
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:25,380
Scott: I'm just saying it was a bad mission.

598
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,842
Scott: I didn't like.

599
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:26,625
Scott: it was not fun.

600
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:27,609
Scott: I enjoyed it.

601
00:35:27,851 --> 00:35:35,130
Rym: I did not enjoy I guess partly because there was Missions like that forced you to become the master of the puzzles or decide that it wasn't worth it to become the master of the puzzles?

602
00:35:35,414 --> 00:35:35,921
Scott: pretty much.

603
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:39,518
Rym: but The other things they've added and we'll go over them briefly.

604
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:40,983
Rym: one the Navy in.

605
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:48,230
Rym: in the early Advance Wars games Naval units were useless unless it was a single-player mission that made you use naval units.

606
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:56,550
Scott: Well, so the Landers could be useful depending on the map All right, and the battleships were useful with their range and holy raining death, right?

607
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,656
Scott: But they were very expensive and very hard to use.

608
00:35:58,696 --> 00:35:58,877
Scott: right?

609
00:35:59,298 --> 00:36:05,310
Scott: but the submarines and the destroyers and and those sorts of things Not really all that useful.

610
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:08,948
Rym: it was more that things ran out of gas and weren't that useful and were really expensive.

611
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:14,710
Rym: and Naval like naval on naval combat as a result was incredibly uninteresting and stupid.

612
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,399
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you built destroyers and submarines and things.

613
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:22,290
Scott: it really didn't help you unless the other guy also built them and you Were just gonna fight them against each other.

614
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:23,486
Scott: He wasn't it didn't you know?

615
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:30,012
Rym: only Battleships could really help you to win the actual game and even then just they were so crippled and they couldn't easily Refuel.

616
00:36:30,072 --> 00:36:42,127
Scott: or the only purpose of the submarines and destroyers was sort of like to fight against battleships and also Prevent people from fighting against your battleships and it really you're better off just buying more battleships than buying destroyers and submarines.

617
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:46,163
Rym: now advance wars DS went a long way to make that better.

618
00:36:46,183 --> 00:36:52,270
Rym: They had the aircraft carriers Yes, and it even though that it wasn't the greatest unit now now that I see the light in the new game.

619
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,365
Rym: But also they added the black boat, which is probably the most important unit.

620
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:56,390
Rym: It was like this boat was okay.

621
00:36:56,693 --> 00:37:04,050
Rym: It was this cheap little you know Naval unit that could hold a troop in it and could repair and reload and refuel other naval units.

622
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,876
Scott: It's like the APC of the sea.

623
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:10,269
Rym: It actually there's no APCs and APCs on the land black boats in the sea.

624
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:19,156
Rym: But it allowed you to have a Navy that could go out into the water and be a Navy and you could have naval battles But you can actually refill your battles.

625
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:22,730
Rym: just they ran out of bullets, but even then it was not great.

626
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:24,173
Rym: New game.

627
00:37:24,635 --> 00:37:30,530
Rym: one battleships can move and shoot in the same turn turning them from a moderately useful unit to fucking death.

628
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:32,082
Scott: That is insane.

629
00:37:32,102 --> 00:37:39,250
Scott: You realize no other Ranged attack unit in the game can move and shoot in the same turn except your mom except you're right.

630
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:41,295
Scott: so the fact that it also is.

631
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:50,319
Scott: the is the most damaging ranged unit the most long range range unit and Can move and shoot at the same time.

632
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,250
Scott: a battleship is holy shit.

633
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:56,218
Scott: That is fucking dangerous And if you have a bunch of them you can decimate your opponent.

634
00:37:56,258 --> 00:38:01,350
Scott: thus the rest of the Navy that fights against battleships becomes very useful.

635
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:05,410
Scott: Everyone who has a Navy is gonna be building battleships really quickly.

636
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:10,855
Rym: Plus you can build temporary ports on beaches to refill stuff, which is just like awesome I love.

637
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,449
Scott: a big problem in the other game is you could only really have.

638
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,216
Scott: you know You can only refill on cities.

639
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,790
Scott: right all ground units could refuel and re-ammo in cities.

640
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:24,270
Scott: But if you wanted to refuel and you weren't, you know, if you were in the water, what could you do?

641
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,929
Rym: You had to get a black boat, right or you could go over to the land and go next to an APC.

642
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:36,473
Scott: But yeah You can have an APC drive up next to your boat Which means you have to bring your boat next to the land or bring your boat all the way back to your Navy Factory.

643
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:38,402
Scott: at the beginning, you know the other side of the map.

644
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:47,063
Scott: now you can build temporary naval bases And drive your boats into them and it is super helpful in many many maps.

645
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:48,106
Rym: and the gunboat.

646
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:53,587
Rym: just well the gunboat Combined with the way cruisers were the black boat is gone, but we have the gunboat instead.

647
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:55,356
Rym: Yep I love that little like one shot.

648
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,850
Rym: I'll just build a whole bunch of them and send them out swift boating people.

649
00:38:58,071 --> 00:38:59,561
Scott: Yeah, the gunboat is high-quality.

650
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:04,350
Scott: it only gets one shot But it's a fucking powerful shot and you can use it in other boats.

651
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,540
Scott: So if someone else rolls their battleships up to you You can build this cheap-ass gunboat.

652
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:15,525
Scott: roll out there do one shot on it And now it's got a retreat or it's in big trouble and the aircraft carrier works a little differently.

653
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:21,504
Rym: instead of Basically being a super powerful missile unit that sits in the ocean and lets you hide bombers.

654
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:24,774
Rym: It lets you make Sea planes.

655
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:29,737
Rym: we'll get to all the different air units because they did the same thing to the Air Force that they did to the Navy in this game.

656
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:44,010
Rym: Oh, yeah, but basically Naval combat and naval options are viable interesting and important now and That alone would have been enough to make this the best frickin game ever at least in terms of this kind of game.

657
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,765
Scott: Yeah, but not only that but they change the ground and the air.

658
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:49,150
Scott: It's like about the ground of the air first.

659
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,760
Scott: Alright so the air right used to have the fighter which is the.

660
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:56,352
Scott: the fighter does nothing but give you air Superiority.

661
00:39:56,372 --> 00:40:06,970
Scott: if you have fighters in the air then basically the other guy can't fuck with you with air units because your fighters are just so Dangerous, but that's all they still do and that's all they ever needed to do because they were always badass.

662
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,623
Scott: But now they have added in addition to the fighters, right?

663
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:14,830
Rym: Well and the bomber and the bombers, right?

664
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:16,597
Scott: Fighters and bombers and helicopters.

665
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:17,059
Scott: and that was it.

666
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:19,630
Rym: Yeah battle copters were a generally useful unit.

667
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:24,467
Scott: Yeah, battle copters are sort of like the anti ground cheap air unit, right?

668
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:30,469
Scott: It was an air unit So it was pretty hard for you to get it destroyed unless they had anti air and it could mess tanks up.

669
00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:38,950
Scott: Bombers could really fuck things up But you had to sort of like refuel them and supply them and they were a little trickier than the copters but much more dangerous.

670
00:40:39,493 --> 00:40:40,037
Scott: And that was it.

671
00:40:40,298 --> 00:40:41,244
Scott: That was it for the air.

672
00:40:41,747 --> 00:40:45,130
Scott: now Get the seaplane and the duster.

673
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:46,395
Scott: Oh the duster.

674
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:50,490
Rym: the duster is like the battle copter equivalents of a plane.

675
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:54,587
Scott: Yeah, it's basically you mean think about the game had two planes and one helicopter.

676
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:57,190
Scott: now There's four planes in one helicopter.

677
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:02,650
Scott: Well to help there was always the transport copter that lets you carry infantry around but that's that's no different than it ever was.

678
00:41:03,272 --> 00:41:09,130
Scott: But yeah, the duster is really cool because it has sort of like the range of a fighter, right?

679
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,750
Scott: But a fighter which can only attack air units a duster can attack anything.

680
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,694
Scott: You can swoop down.

681
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:15,804
Scott: there was little machine guns and shoot ground units.

682
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:17,090
Scott: It can shoot boats.

683
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,050
Scott: I think it can shoot anything pretty much but it flies and that is super freakin useful.

684
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:33,684
Scott: Like if a guy, you know I always use it like to get those already damaged units like up that guy over there has three health duster got him Yep, or the tanks are coming and I don't have my anti tanks in place yet to hold the bridge.

685
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:39,510
Scott: duster's gonna go sit on The bridge, yeah, you can use the duster because it has such the range of a fighter.

686
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:42,982
Scott: You can use it to go harass their infantry trying to capture cities.

687
00:41:43,363 --> 00:41:45,450
Scott: You can use it to clean up almost dead units.

688
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:49,230
Scott: You can use it to shoot at their helicopters before you build anti-air.

689
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,016
Scott: It's just.

690
00:41:50,298 --> 00:41:56,406
Scott: it's not particularly powerful But it's incredibly versatile and the building a few early on will help you out a lot.

691
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:58,893
Rym: now the seaplane Badass lo-am.

692
00:41:58,913 --> 00:42:01,621
Rym: I was just a super awesome kind of ground attack.

693
00:42:02,363 --> 00:42:06,256
Rym: air attack like all-around great thing, but The trick is.

694
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:08,244
Rym: now the problem with all the other advanced wars.

695
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:09,308
Rym: They had the aircraft carrier.

696
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:21,683
Rym: Yay Using it for anything in any kind of versus situation was actually not that good of an idea Because in the time it took you to get the money to build one then

697
00:42:21,763 --> 00:42:23,910
Scott: buy planes and put the planes on the air

698
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:26,919
Rym: Send it out and then bring the planes out.

699
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,182
Rym: that didn't work.

700
00:42:28,202 --> 00:42:30,850
Rym: You were much better off just building neo tanks upon neo tanks.

701
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:39,557
Scott: Buy an aircraft carrier buy a plane put the plane on the aircraft carrier move the aircraft carrier Get the plane off the aircraft carrier.

702
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:40,882
Rym: now move the plane.

703
00:42:41,203 --> 00:42:42,468
Scott: It was like so.

704
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:45,970
Rym: now Aircraft carriers are basically seaplane factories.

705
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:52,800
Rym: So you drive it I fly it out there drive it out there you sail it out there and then You can just build seaplanes on it.

706
00:42:53,302 --> 00:42:55,230
Scott: and it makes planes in the boat.

707
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,957
Scott: They have a plane factory in the boat.

708
00:42:57,038 --> 00:43:02,119
Rym: and even better when you launch a seaplane you don't just say alright I'm gonna put it next to my thing and next round and move it.

709
00:43:02,741 --> 00:43:03,424
Rym: It comes out.

710
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:04,388
Rym: attacks immediately.

711
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:13,075
Scott: Yep So if they have you know any unit near your aircraft carrier, you can just send the plane out shoot Oh, that's so good.

712
00:43:13,236 --> 00:43:14,563
Rym: Yep for land and sea.

713
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:16,070
Rym: I mean battleships coming.

714
00:43:16,412 --> 00:43:20,310
Rym: Well aircraft carrier just start sending ships out to intercept that fucker as well.

715
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,784
Scott: If you have a lot of money aircraft carriers, I think are the best way.

716
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:30,366
Scott: if you have a lot of money on a naval map I think an aircraft carrier loaded with seaplanes or two is is the best way you could spend your money.

717
00:43:30,386 --> 00:43:41,220
Scott: because just having that there With the range of the seaplanes because the boat can move and then launch a plane that is so Ridiculously far across the map that you can do heavy heavy damage.

718
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:44,209
Scott: and if you have multiple planes god damn god damn.

719
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:46,250
Rym: now ground units.

720
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,784
Rym: Basically, I want to talk about two things because these things bikes and anti-tanks.

721
00:43:52,285 --> 00:43:53,850
Rym: Oh my god war tanks, whatever.

722
00:43:55,111 --> 00:44:02,350
Scott: War tanks are sort of the same as the the mega tank but a little weaker and they got rid of the neo tank Which is upsetting but the neo tank was overpowered.

723
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:07,810
Rym: We'll talk about the anti-tank first because I think the bike is probably the most revolutionary unit.

724
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:18,949
Scott: It is the anti-tank though is incredibly revolutionary because first of all every long-range unit in the every artillery unit in the game You know something that shoots something that's not next to it, right?

725
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:22,061
Scott: You couldn't shoot something direct like an artillery.

726
00:44:22,122 --> 00:44:24,210
Scott: the minute had a minimum range of two, right?

727
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,610
Scott: It did that you couldn't shoot something directly next to an artillery with that artillery.

728
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,233
Scott: It doesn't work.

729
00:44:29,796 --> 00:44:32,148
Scott: the anti-tank can shoot something directly next to it.

730
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:36,949
Scott: Also every ranged attack unit in the game such as the battleship and such, right?

731
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:44,406
Scott: If something attacks it directly, let's say I roll my tank right up next to your rocket All right, which is a range unit and I shoot it.

732
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:48,866
Scott: Your rocket doesn't shoot back at my tank it it goes ah shit.

733
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:55,479
Scott: it goes ah shit You know, I mean if a guy's sending of the howitzer and you come up and with a tank He really can't shoot you at the howitzer.

734
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:56,504
Scott: You're right in front of him.

735
00:44:56,524 --> 00:44:58,812
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't work like that Right, and it makes sense.

736
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:00,677
Scott: the anti-tank.

737
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:05,739
Scott: Not only does it have a it is short range, but it's powerful against tanks At least.

738
00:45:06,107 --> 00:45:06,250
Rym: yeah.

739
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,699
Rym: basically what it adds to the game is another tactical option.

740
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:21,710
Rym: if you couldn't it wasn't easy without doing puzzle game bullshit to Kind of move into an area secure it and then hold it while Reinforcements come or you like rebuild your supply line or anything.

741
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:32,528
Scott: Yeah, I mean when you in the older games you would build a bunch of tanks march in and take an area from the opponent but in doing so the guys that were left in that area were heavily weakened.

742
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:36,390
Scott: and Since you're moving towards the opponent generally, right?

743
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:52,765
Scott: That those weakened guys are much closer to your opponent than you are and it's gonna take you some time to get new units Out there to refresh and it becomes you pretty much always had to attack or treat attack retreat you know to keep your guys who's getting

744
00:45:52,805 --> 00:45:53,228
Rym: hosed

745
00:45:53,249 --> 00:46:02,419
Scott: and the only way to really move ahead and gain territory in the game was either if it was a map that was built with Factories right up on the line there

746
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:04,046
Rym: or you just had to play the puzzle game

747
00:46:04,207 --> 00:46:04,930
Scott: or the puzzle game.

748
00:46:05,814 --> 00:46:07,541
Rym: Now the anti-tank.

749
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:11,519
Rym: pretty much it's a Defensive area denial unit.

750
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:14,090
Rym: you put it in a city like you take you know attack with it.

751
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:14,673
Scott: It doesn't work.

752
00:46:14,714 --> 00:46:17,110
Rym: like you take an area you put it in a city.

753
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:22,324
Rym: It will now allow you to hold not just like a perimeter defense, but defensive depth.

754
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:26,216
Rym: It'll let you hold that area and That alone adds.

755
00:46:26,377 --> 00:46:29,030
Scott: It's not an unbreakable hold, but it is a strong hold.

756
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,709
Scott: Do you move your tanks in you blow some guys up?

757
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:33,566
Scott: You're rolling an anti-tank in there.

758
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:40,524
Scott: now Even if they come and get on you That anti-tank is pretty rough to destroy unless they have just the right units.

759
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:47,410
Rym: it adds so much to the game that yeah but Equally important if not more so is the bike.

760
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:51,604
Rym: It's just a normal inventory unit that moves real real far.

761
00:46:51,664 --> 00:46:53,570
Rym: now you might think this is more powerful.

762
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:54,319
Rym: No, no.

763
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:55,330
Rym: does do anything special.

764
00:46:55,471 --> 00:47:05,630
Rym: No, in fact it can't even go places normal infantry can go because it's got wheels can't go in a mountain Can't go in a any sort of troop trans and it's more expensive than regular infantry to cost as much as a mech yep.

765
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:12,270
Rym: So uh what it allows is what mechanized infantry allowed in the real world.

766
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:17,870
Rym: Basically in the old advanced wars games you could roll tanks over and fight with people and whatever.

767
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,882
Rym: But the game was pretty much a game of play.

768
00:47:20,902 --> 00:47:38,157
Rym: the puzzle destroy the other person's units Eventually destroy all their stuff and get to their base or play the puzzle of you have like the one APC with one mech in it and you get over there, and you're tricky and you capture his HQ, but there was no sort of capture a territory fortify it and then continue.

769
00:47:38,177 --> 00:47:38,257
Rym: yeah

770
00:47:38,277 --> 00:47:56,556
Scott: because what happened was you were very limited by the speed of the infantry and the APCs and the transport copters were very powerful because you know there's a map right a big map where there's a lot of space And a lot of neutral cities right and you want to fight to capture those neutral cities because and neutral factories even more Because that's difference between winning and losing.

771
00:47:56,596 --> 00:48:02,830
Scott: right there you had to build APCs and transport copters And your infantry can only move so far.

772
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:11,270
Scott: So it was a game of I have to move these guys really far and you had these tanks Rolling up and doing damage, and you had to get these infantry to catch up with them.

773
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:31,068
Rym: And now that's actually why I pretty much always won when we played like big old multiplayer advanced wars is in the old games is Because the game the fun way to play the game and the tech like the interesting way to play the game Is not the way to win because in the old games the way to win I pretty much built twice as many inventories as anyone else who played.

774
00:48:31,088 --> 00:48:38,850
Rym: yeah And I would advance slowly and you'd have this supply line of infantry Marching forward in every direction.

775
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:43,265
Scott: I'm advancing all the time because you can't capture anything without infantry even if you have a million tanks.

776
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:52,030
Rym: you can't capture anything without Infantry and in order to do that you have to play the puzzle game of counting spaces counting APCs Doing the APC moving trick.

777
00:48:52,110 --> 00:49:02,050
Scott: how can I how can I get the infantry to move the farthest and the least number of turns and capture the most cities and Least number of turns and how can I make sure that they're over there when my tanks get there?

778
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:08,227
Rym: It was much like my strategy in a team fortress classic or mega team fortress or weapons factory.

779
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:09,330
Rym: do the thing.

780
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:17,410
Rym: That's not fun But we'll almost always win you the game because no one else is going to be boring enough or insane enough to do it.

781
00:49:18,013 --> 00:49:26,130
Rym: But now you have these bikes that can move really far Significantly far and you can just have inventory intersperse with your tanks and you can attack and then hold an area.

782
00:49:26,276 --> 00:49:28,200
Scott: Yes You can have tanks roll out.

783
00:49:28,522 --> 00:49:29,730
Scott: go boom boom boom boom boom.

784
00:49:30,091 --> 00:49:38,179
Scott: the bikes move right in immediately as soon as you blow the other guy up and take a cities and then your Antitanks roll on top of those cities and you got them now.

785
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:56,406
Rym: the net result of all these changes is basically that advance wars 2 on the DS days of ruin days of ruin my name varies by nation is pretty much the best Tactical strategy war game I've played on a video game system.

786
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:57,690
Rym: turn bet is turn based.

787
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:09,515
Rym: Yeah in a long time indeed this game is So fantastic and I cannot stress enough how different it is From the other advanced wars.

788
00:50:09,817 --> 00:50:12,990
Rym: because the other advanced wars you'd think like oh well you want to be cool like.

789
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:20,539
Rym: well I'm gonna send up a small hit squad through the fog of war to the south to capture those cities and then harass from the Hills.

790
00:50:20,868 --> 00:50:23,681
Rym: well I said my main force around through the north and attack from behind.

791
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:25,709
Scott: that's something else and you know that never worked.

792
00:50:25,729 --> 00:50:29,749
Scott: in the real And the old advanced wars there are a lot of fog of war puzzles right where it would be.

793
00:50:30,191 --> 00:50:31,778
Scott: Okay, you can't if you're in the tree.

794
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:34,610
Scott: No one can see you unless they stand next to the tree, right?

795
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:42,270
Scott: So you would have to like send guys out recon guys to stand next to trees Then shoot the guys in those trees then move into the tree yourself.

796
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:42,813
Scott: And it was.

797
00:50:43,235 --> 00:50:45,388
Scott: it was a trick of seeing and not being seen.

798
00:50:45,468 --> 00:50:48,564
Scott: now They got the flare unit the flare unit.

799
00:50:48,584 --> 00:50:55,199
Scott: You just build it It shoots a flare and you can see and all man It totally changes up the fog of war.

800
00:50:55,219 --> 00:51:02,569
Scott: dynamic fog of war is no longer a puzzle Fog of war is now actually a fight, but you just need to use these flare units to sort of back it up.

801
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:03,853
Rym: So that's it.

802
00:51:03,973 --> 00:51:07,321
Rym: the game is now an actual tactical strategic game.

803
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:10,228
Rym: you can make strategies you can you can implement them.

804
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:18,569
Rym: you can Send battle copters on a kamikaze mission to take out those anti-airs in advance of the main bomber squadron getting there.

805
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:25,524
Rym: Doing something like that in the original advanced wars games was needlessly complicated Usually useless and not the optimal way to get win.

806
00:51:25,885 --> 00:51:28,277
Rym: but in this game That's everything.

807
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,288
Rym: Yeah supply lines matter.

808
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:37,070
Scott: the game That different on the surface, you know to the average player but in reality the game is super different.

809
00:51:37,992 --> 00:51:42,257
Rym: Also, I would like to point out that the AI is Not stupid now.

810
00:51:42,478 --> 00:51:43,544
Scott: Yeah, the AI used to.

811
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:50,930
Scott: not it wasn't gene It wasn't smart before but it was sort of programmed to do Annoying things on different maps because they were puzzle based maps.

812
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,750
Scott: So it was like aha the AI is gonna do this and you know.

813
00:51:53,750 --> 00:52:00,101
Rym: But also like an advanced wars one you could on the D of the DBA you could trick the AI Attack an APC.

814
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:01,410
Scott: Yeah, you said an APC out.

815
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,589
Scott: They would attack the APC with their most powerful units.

816
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:07,142
Scott: then you counter-attack their most powerful units with your untouched most powerful.

817
00:52:07,162 --> 00:52:11,498
Rym: now the AI is still stupid basically, but It's so much smarter than it used to be.

818
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:14,510
Rym: You can't really trick it unless you're really pay attention.

819
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,806
Rym: Like I figured out a couple of things you can use to kind of trick the AI.

820
00:52:18,846 --> 00:52:19,890
Rym: Well, I'll give you all a hint.

821
00:52:20,436 --> 00:52:28,330
Rym: the AI is Extremely risk-averse with expensive units, but it is extremely kamikaze with cheap units.

822
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:38,750
Rym: Case in point it'll send a battle copter right next to your anti-aircraft to do six damage to your rockets But they will never ever ever risk the bomber.

823
00:52:39,412 --> 00:52:45,690
Scott: No, like for example, they had a fighter once right I had two fighters that I had pretty much most of the map covered.

824
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,910
Scott: Right, they would not move there.

825
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:53,604
Scott: their fighter would keep running into the corner of the map to hide to where I could not get it so that it would not be destroyed.

826
00:52:53,665 --> 00:53:00,410
Scott: but As soon as there was a situation in which they can make an attack that would do a significant amount of damage.

827
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:06,370
Scott: They rolled in like three power like three war tanks like doom doom doom Because they did so much damage with that.

828
00:53:06,453 --> 00:53:07,976
Scott: of course I counter-attacked and that was it.

829
00:53:08,056 --> 00:53:09,221
Scott: but they wouldn't.

830
00:53:09,342 --> 00:53:14,299
Scott: they wouldn't go into my zone of Dangerousness until they had a significant advantage.

831
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,010
Scott: They wouldn't roll in to do a piddly, you know, ting ting twink.

832
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:23,297
Rym: They only roll in to do the heavy hit and the AI also in general will pull a lot of Tricky shit.

833
00:53:23,317 --> 00:53:27,020
Rym: if you're not looking for it pretty much Anytime you think you've got an opening.

834
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,465
Rym: if you're you know, if you're not good at these games You're new to them or you're not doing so.

835
00:53:30,506 --> 00:53:34,504
Rym: well Every time you think oh man, this rocket is totally exposed.

836
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:35,729
Rym: odds are it's not.

837
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:42,502
Rym: look There's probably another rocket covering it or a medium tank That's just within range of whatever you use to attack it.

838
00:53:42,964 --> 00:53:56,710
Rym: The AI covers its bases pretty damn well, and in the last mission Pretty much the AI will say alright What's the most dangerous unit that's closest to the thing you have to blow up to win the game.

839
00:53:57,131 --> 00:53:59,596
Rym: Oh, I'm gonna send all my fighters over there to kill it.

840
00:53:59,797 --> 00:54:03,505
Scott: No matter what great great How many fighters they have?

841
00:54:03,545 --> 00:54:03,950
Scott: a hundred?

842
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,374
Rym: Let me put it this way in the last mission.

843
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:12,069
Rym: I like 40 cities and I fought to the last man and I didn't win.

844
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,376
Rym: Wow multiple times.

845
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:15,098
Scott: Wow.

846
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:17,024
Scott: I got to get to this mission.

847
00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:20,317
Rym: pretty the worst thing is one time Not to spoil.

848
00:54:20,337 --> 00:54:29,245
Rym: but when you see the mission, you'll know I'm gonna say this the center laser Had two hit points left and it was the only laser left.

849
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:38,330
Rym: I Could not Get so much as an infantry or anything even within striking distance.

850
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:42,202
Rym: Yeah, and I died to the last bitter man.

851
00:54:42,222 --> 00:54:44,970
Scott: I built my last ever played at the last bitter man.

852
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:50,987
Rym: I built my last war tank and it was immediately surrounded by two war tanks and two bombers and I lost.

853
00:54:51,449 --> 00:54:56,829
Rym: Wow Yeah But uh multiplayer is awesome.

854
00:54:57,931 --> 00:54:59,959
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about the Wi-Fi because it's Nintendo.

855
00:54:59,999 --> 00:55:00,883
Rym: their Wi-Fi is dick.

856
00:55:01,304 --> 00:55:02,830
Scott: The Wi-Fi is useless shit.

857
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:05,441
Scott: I basically pretend it doesn't even exist cuz not worth using.

858
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:07,289
Rym: I'll say this I went and played on the Wi-Fi.

859
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:08,388
Rym: It works pretty well.

860
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:09,094
Rym: I don't.

861
00:55:09,195 --> 00:55:14,829
Rym: I don't think there'll be many people playing it other than Friends and I could see myself using it to play with like Pete and Alex.

862
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:18,750
Scott: Yeah, if I was if I was you know, looking for I was pretty bored looking for some action.

863
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:22,102
Scott: I would you know get it get a friend on I am or something and you know.

864
00:55:22,143 --> 00:55:24,311
Scott: trade the friend code and play online with Them.

865
00:55:24,412 --> 00:55:25,179
Scott: Yeah, it works really well.

866
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:27,936
Scott: wouldn't do that too often I'd have to be pretty bored to do.

867
00:55:27,956 --> 00:55:31,289
Rym: but I played with some strangers right and I learned one thing they all suck.

868
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:37,490
Rym: We're playing against people on the Wi-Fi in advance Wars, especially if you're one of those nut jobs.

869
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:39,850
Rym: You're like it's just plays these games obsessively.

870
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:56,984
Rym: Yeah, you kind of wreck people to the point that like you can almost feel the frustration as Every unit they move runs into an ambush and then blows up Every round and every time they send someone out to go try to take a factory.

871
00:55:57,465 --> 00:55:58,809
Rym: I've already got the factory.

872
00:56:02,514 --> 00:56:05,270
Rym: But yeah, this game is one of those must-have games for the DS.

873
00:56:05,892 --> 00:56:07,819
Scott: Yeah, if you don't have a DS I know what's wrong with you.

874
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,227
Scott: they got new blue and black DS is coming out.

875
00:56:10,307 --> 00:56:12,515
Scott: finally a Halfway decent color.

876
00:56:12,615 --> 00:56:13,237
Scott: I ordered one.

877
00:56:13,498 --> 00:56:14,321
Scott: It'll be here soon.

878
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:16,750
Scott: Then I'll have a fat DS to give to somebody.

879
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,818
Rym: Yeah, well, we're Emily's already got a DS.

880
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,510
Rym: So who needs a DS that we know my family.

881
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:31,707
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

882
00:56:31,787 --> 00:56:34,294
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

883
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:46,160
Scott: be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com Where you'll find show notes links our awesome forum a link to our frapper map and links to all the RSS feeds.

884
00:56:46,741 --> 00:56:52,380
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

885
00:56:52,922 --> 00:56:55,091
