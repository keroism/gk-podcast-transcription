Rym: Well.

23
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:18,019
Rym: I was talking to Emily and here's a bit of errata a bit of Something that I didn't realize and Emily pointed out to me and made me feel dumb kind of like when Scott noticed one day that Beatles wasn't spelled like the bug.

24
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:32,930
Rym: yeah, so I Said I was playing Atari games and Emily says Atari means to win in Japanese yeah, and I was like That's why when you play go and you're gonna win.

25
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:33,413
Scott: it's Atari.

00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:33,734
Scott: yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:36,282 --> 00:01:38,698
Rym: Anyway today, we're gonna talk about food.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,140
Rym: Maybe I think we're channeling the goats of Dave and Joel fast karate for the gentleman.

29
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:53,545
Scott: I think we're channeling the ghosts of didn't get enough sleep started recording the episode too late ate a lot of food and Then had a busy day.

30
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:58,266
Rym: see the thing is other than tonight when I didn't do anything And I just wasted my day.

31
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,933
Rym: I had a really good day.

32
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,340
Rym: Yeah, I mean I woke up.

33
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,760
Rym: It was alright, and the weather was a bit shit.

34
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:06,584
Rym: I'm sorry movies.

35
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,330
Rym: You should see I can't stop making.

36
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:10,900
Scott: ram is just becoming a pile of podcast references.

37
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,704
Scott: I am me.

38
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:13,351
Scott: why does it just be the meta podcast.

39
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:15,380
Scott: We'll just mention every other podcast in the world.

40
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:17,246
Rym: That's really a podcast reference.

41
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,954
Rym: I think that's more of a British podcast pointer.

42
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,037
Scott: alright alright.

43
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:21,739
Rym: It's a bit shit.

44
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:26,132
Rym: So you know I wait weather's crappy and you find this tree.

45
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:31,920
Rym: Yeah our way to ruin my story I know right alright, so I'm at work, and I'm wandering around.

46
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:37,700
Rym: I'm at the bottom tip of the Bronx like Manhattan is right there, and I'm working on some stuff.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,069
Rym: And I'm dressed up really nice cuz I was meeting with a client.

48
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:42,860
Rym: so you know I'm wearing really nice like business professional.

49
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:53,049
Rym: I got a little messenger bag, and I got all my paperwork And I am a stuffy looking white-collar businessman, and I walk out of the place I was working and I'm walking toward my car.

50
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,957
Rym: I parked a couple blocks away on like 227th Street.

51
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:06,204
Rym: As I'm walking I pass a park And there's a perfect climbing tree the same kind of tree that I had in my front yard when I was in high school But pretty much the best climbing tree.

52
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:13,070
Rym: I'd seen in a long time, and I look around and There's a no one watching me.

53
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:15,500
Rym: the streets empty because it's like one o'clock.

54
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,348
Rym: So I drop all my stuff.

55
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,283
Rym: I unbuttoned the top top couple buttons in my shirt I untuck it.

56
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,233
Rym: I jump up, and I climb that goddamn tree.

57
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:29,104
Rym: I climbed like 20 feet of the air now one.

58
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:48,199
Rym: I would like to point out that I am a little bit older than I was the last time I climbed a tree and I don't feel really slower, or you know starting to wear down in any real way But I can tell you that my body felt a lot heavier and a lot more fragile Than it used to when I was climbing that tree.

59
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:56,559
Scott: Yeah, I noticed that too when I was a kid I used to be like jump down a jillion stairs And I do all kinds of crazy stuff.

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,695
Scott: Nowadays, I'll like a jump that when I was a kid would have been no problem.

61
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:01,996
Scott: now.

62
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:07,174
Rym: I look at it like Yeah, I got to the top, and I remember thinking you know if I fall.

63
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:08,740
Rym: I'll probably die.

64
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:15,020
Rym: Yeah, so then you know I climb back down, and I I'd like jump off the last the second to last branch.

65
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:22,320
Rym: I catch the last branch I swing back and forth a bunch of times And then I land and I think all right I can get on with my businessman life.

66
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:26,063
Rym: Then I hear the clapping The clapping.

67
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:29,353
Scott: you say so I turn around screw you and give you the clap.

68
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:33,588
Rym: that was the dumbest joke I've ever heard anyone.

69
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:36,420
Scott: That's the kind of joke that's gonna come out when I'm tired on a Thursday.

70
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:38,291
Rym: I see I'm not that tired.

71
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,840
Rym: I'm pretty tired all right.

72
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:51,633
Rym: So there's this dude in a wheelchair this old man, and he's clapping And he wheels over to me, and he puts his hand up And he says man you just made my day, and he rolls his wheelchair away.

73
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:53,460
Rym: Just laughing as hard as he can.

74
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,918
Scott: So I that's an awesome dude.

75
00:04:56,121 --> 00:05:03,638
Rym: So I rebuttened up my you know Businessman shirt and I pick up my businessman briefcase and I walk back to my car and drive back to my office in Yonkers.

76
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,050
Scott: yeah Yeah, today.

77
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,980
Scott: I actually I have worked.

78
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:08,057
Scott: I got work to do.

79
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:11,826
Scott: They're launching this site on Saturday and I have to.

80
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:15,160
Scott: I had an application that I wrote that I have to integrate into the site.

81
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:17,439
Scott: And you know what I learned from working today.

82
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,249
Scott: See I was worried that from not working for so long.

83
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:26,811
Scott: You know just sitting at work not doing anything and that You know I lost my skills of working.

84
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:30,517
Rym: and then you know I worry that occasionally I'll be at work, and I'll be like then.

85
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:34,267
Scott: today I worked for maybe an hour And I got so much crazy shit done.

86
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:40,787
Scott: if I actually worked eight hours a day of actually working Do you know how much shit I would do?

87
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:45,480
Scott: I'd probably die from doing that, but yeah, I would do so much crap.

88
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,352
Scott: It would be insane, so I don't know am I?

89
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,319
Scott: I'm feeling in the mood of working yet I think I might start producing work soon.

90
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,647
Rym: Yeah, maybe you won't though.

91
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,173
Rym: I have this feeling you won't no.

92
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,625
Scott: I think I'm gonna at least tomorrow I am for sure.

93
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:09,740
Scott: another thing is I started As I was looking around on dig and there was some website that said to take a picture every day And I have a digital camera that I don't use enough, so I said why the hell not?

94
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:18,184
Scott: So if you pay attention to my flicker, I'm gonna take one photo every day from now on all right yep We'll see.

95
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:22,119
Rym: cuz I had a vision as to what kind of pictures Scott was gonna be taking.

96
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:28,933
Scott: well The idea is to try to take a picture that sort of sums up your day So you can look at the picture and then remember that day.

97
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:32,247
Rym: I imagine 365.25 pictures of a phallus.

98
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:41,460
Scott: No, no the first picture is actually picture of the phone on my desk at work because I had a conference call today.

99
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,808
Scott: That was pretty much the height of my day.

100
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:46,678
Scott: Wow it was the last time I ever used that phone at work.

101
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,646
Scott: never That never used the phone.

102
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,550
Rym: that was the height of your.

103
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,655
Rym: I climbed a tree.

104
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:53,646
Scott: never use the phone at work So it's like a strange thing to use it.

105
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,477
Rym: I climbed a tree, and you took a picture of a telephone.

106
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:59,386
Rym: yep Right so in the news.

107
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:02,660
Rym: I don't know much to say about this, but there's been a lot of talk.

108
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,358
Rym: I mean we've been bashing blu-ray and HD DVD and a lot of people have been saying it'll do poorly.

109
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:25,421
Rym: and a lot of people Have been saying that we're just really pessimistic, and I'd like to note that as of the most recent sales figures The sale of blu-ray and HD DVD devices has fallen a bit short of the projected sales And by a bit I mean more than 60%.

110
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,505
Scott: That's not unexpected.

111
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:30,860
Scott: who the hell has an HDTV and who the hell's gonna shell out a hajillion dollars to one of these players?

112
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:36,211
Rym: Practically no one has bought HD equipment for blu-ray or HD.

113
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:37,937
Scott: you know who's buying most of the equipment?

114
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:38,640
Scott: no one.

115
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:42,495
Scott: Gadget review websites like in gadget and gizmodo and even better.

116
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:43,620
Rym: I'm not gonna read magazines.

117
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:46,876
Rym: I'm not gonna read into this very much because there's really.

118
00:07:46,896 --> 00:08:03,399
Rym: I mean I'm not sure exactly how they got these numbers But they say that they expect game consoles that are equipped to play blu-ray or HD DVD To make up 1 million of the 1.7 million devices that will be sold before the end of the year.

119
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:07,840
Rym: now Didn't Sony say they're gonna have 2 million PlayStation threes?

120
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:09,087
Scott: I don't know.

121
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:10,073
Scott: Maybe maybe not?

122
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:12,103
Rym: so yeah They did so.

123
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:17,359
Rym: how come the industry here is saying that they expect 1 million to be sold?

124
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:19,276
Scott: I don't know either.

125
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,121
Scott: They don't.

126
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:24,255
Scott: is also supposedly gonna be some HD DVD thing on the 360?

127
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,720
Scott: who knows it's up in the air.

128
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,185
Rym: That was pretty much a rumor so far.

129
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:29,112
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna see what comes of that.

130
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:30,035
Scott: It's craziness.

131
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:30,758
Scott: probably nothing.

132
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,183
Scott: probably I have.

133
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:44,235
Scott: there might be a chance that they'll sell Xbox 360 the HD DVD players or they'll sell like a replacement disk drive for it and I don't know if they're gonna put games exclusively on HD DVD though.

134
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,500
Scott: That's that's a long shot.

135
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:50,817
Rym: Yeah, see I was gonna do the news about the correlation between being fat and being dumb.

136
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:51,620
Scott: What happened to that news?

137
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,200
Rym: I'm gonna use that Monday, so you can all stew about it over the weekend all right.

138
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:59,652
Scott: So my news isn't really in news, but it's pretty cool.

139
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:07,726
Scott: the guy who made bit torrent Bram Cohen Right he was talking about Share ratios.

140
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:20,892
Scott: you see there are a lot of bit torrent trackers And what those track and these are basically run by people who have the same logic as the olden day IRC f-serves which I guess still exist in a lot of places.

141
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:29,948
Scott: and the logic was you know This is a or the hotline servers also remember those you ran one of the most popular anime hotline servers out there.

142
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:40,880
Scott: I did and then I got rid of it cuz hotline died, but Basically the way those servers worked was you would download files from the server But in order to get files you had to upload new files.

143
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:52,326
Scott: So if you ran a server that would had a lot of files to begin with you were going to get a lot of more New files and it was basically saying hey if you were the kind of person who uploads to me Then you can get from me.

144
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:53,131
Rym: you want to know how.

145
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:58,110
Scott: I make sure there was a fair shake Especially back in the days of rename the same file upload it.

146
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,105
Rym: no no no much simpler than that in the days of FTP file servers mm-hmm.

147
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:11,295
Rym: I made a file that was 1.8 gigabytes And I would just set that to upload for a while and then I download everything I wanted.

148
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:12,700
Rym: then I never connected that site again.

149
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,920
Scott: Yeah, yeah, no, but a lot of bit torrent trackers have are setting share ratio monitors.

150
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:29,950
Scott: What they do is they say hey if you're only downloading and then closing right away instead of sticking around and uploading Then we're gonna kick you off of our you know torrent trackers.

151
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,214
Scott: You can't get our stuff anymore.

152
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:31,876
Rym: That's fine.

153
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:32,478
Rym: Whatever?

154
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:40,600
Scott: well Those people are complaining because now people are you getting bit torrent clients that?

155
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:48,588
Scott: Falsely report how much they are uploading and downloading so that they don't get banned by trackers Even if they do things the right way.

156
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,059
Rym: oh fine, whatever it was a self-correcting situation right?

157
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,148
Scott: so Bram Cohen you know what they'd happened.

158
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:58,716
Scott: is the people running those trackers right?

159
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:05,880
Scott: we're complaining that They need to change the bit torrent protocol so people can't lie about how much they're uploading and downloading.

160
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:07,244
Rym: Let me guess.

161
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:11,496
Rym: my guess here is that mr.. Bit torrent gave them the double-deuce.

162
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,800
Scott: Oh he gave him the triple-deuce.

163
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,550
Scott: He's like you know what if you weren't banning people?

164
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,597
Scott: they wouldn't need to be lying in the first place.

165
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:21,912
Scott: and also You're banning based on share ratio is completely stupid.

166
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:24,240
Scott: There's nothing wrong with bit torrent the way it is.

167
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,052
Scott: You don't need to force people to seed you know.

168
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:31,654
Scott: and then he goes on to talk about how You know when someone if there's a new torrent.

169
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:35,091
Scott: That's hot right There's gonna be a lot of whoever's uploading it.

170
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:55,760
Scott: at that point the few uploaders are gonna Have a lot of upload activity and then in the middle of the torrent You know there's gonna be you know really hot activity on both ends and then towards the end if Someone comes in to download at that point They're gonna get the file really quick because there'll be a bunch of cedars and no one else downloading because it's it's already done.

171
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:02,520
Scott: So people coming in late to a torrent we get shafted by these idiots who don't know how to run their trackers.

172
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,219
Scott: and those are the people who get banned just because they came late to a torrent.

173
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:10,560
Scott: and You know people wouldn't get to upload so much by that point.

174
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:14,597
Scott: And he's like you shouldn't ban people from your tracker based on share ratios.

175
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:15,380
Scott: blah blah blah blah blah.

176
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:15,874
Scott: He's right.

177
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:16,100
Scott: well

178
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:30,180
Rym: I gotta say back in the days of winmx if I was at my computer I'd periodically look cuz I let a lot of people download from me And I had a lot of stuff And I just watch and anyone who was downloading slowly I would just kick them off so other people could get my stuff.

179
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,013
Scott: That's what I would do.

180
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:36,980
Scott: also You know if you someone was downloading too much stuff, or they were too much was fine.

181
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:45,812
Rym: Well, no too much at once like I like that exclusion of other people trying to get in there You could set up filters that prevented that automatically and queued people up.

182
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:47,820
Scott: Yeah, I try, but it was always kind of tricky.

183
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,533
Scott: Ah, it didn't always work.

184
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:55,880
Scott: for some reason I can always inevitably get one guy downloading a thousand things at once or like queuing up a thousand things.

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,775
Scott: And it was annoying especially when I wanted to close winmx and play a game.

186
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,140
Rym: see I would just close winmx.

187
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:07,620
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but you know the point is is people try to you know deal with these digital.

188
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,477
Scott: You know p2p sharing as if it's a trade.

189
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:11,899
Scott: They're like.

190
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:13,064
Scott: You know.

191
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:23,487
Scott: they try to force people you know like to know and take equally You know like they keep trying to force people to give and take equally to force Fair sharing.

192
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:26,377
Scott: all bit torrent is designed to share fairly by default.

193
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:27,260
Scott: You don't need to do anything.

194
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:28,599
Rym: This has always been around.

195
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:34,925
Rym: This is the same people who beg and beg and beg and whine at IRC to be given up And then they lord it over people.

196
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:38,737
Rym: the same people who care how many MP3 files they have.

197
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:44,365
Rym: The same people who care if they got the zero day wares Because it makes them cool.

198
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:52,409
Scott: Yeah, see I'm glad that the Bram Cohen bit torrent guy has given them the shaft But on the other hand you know it does show.

199
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:56,340
Scott: the one weakness of open source is that idiots are inevitably going.

200
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:58,180
Scott: You know bit torrents open source.

201
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:05,320
Scott: There are a lot of bit torrent clients and tracker softwares out there that it that allow them to do things this asshat way.

202
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:06,665
Rym: Well what I mean?

203
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:08,333
Rym: a lying about your share ratio, whatever.

204
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:09,076
Rym: that doesn't mean any.

205
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:15,218
Rym: no no no also You know banning people based on Sherry that that really only has to do with the tracker and not the client.

206
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,383
Scott: yeah Well, it's.

207
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,699
Scott: it's both of those things combined and neither one of them should really exist.

208
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:27,240
Rym: so your point was because Open-source exists people might use open source code to do things that you don't agree with personally.

209
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:30,219
Scott: Yeah, okay that could end up harming me.

210
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,737
Scott: You know I want to get a file, but it's the server's run by assets.

211
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,500
Rym: so now I can't get it, but you just get it anyway you deal with the assets, and then you take their stuff.

212
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,034
Rym: I don't deal with assets, okay, then how you gonna get stuff that assets have?

213
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:43,460
Scott: I'm gonna kick their ass.

214
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,510
Rym: I mean if you ever actually well kick their hat.

215
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,460
Rym: I don't think you've ever actually run into this problem.

216
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,030
Rym: No, you've never run into a file.

217
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,080
Rym: You couldn't get because someone was being an asshat.

218
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,105
Rym: It's a fake problem.

219
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:54,934
Scott: You made a straw man problems.

220
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:56,744
Scott: It could happen It didn't.

221
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,980
Scott: that's cuz I don't hang around those sleazy places getting sleazy files.

222
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,807
Scott: Yeah, it's mostly like porno, but torrent trackers I Imagine where's bit torrent trackers?

223
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:08,413
Scott: no one else actually cares about that shit.

224
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,019
Rym: Yeah, so where do you get your porn anyway?

225
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:15,315
Scott: No, and then thinking about it getting it from a new place so where he been getting it?

226
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:16,882
Scott: I Don't know.

227
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:18,271
Scott: I'm looking for new places.

228
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:18,754
Scott: What do you mean?

229
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:19,499
Rym: You don't know?

230
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:24,540
Rym: How can you not know where your porn comes from unless you don't want to say the name of it because it's something.

231
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:32,213
Scott: No, it's not really that weird that weird All right, so wait a minute.

232
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:33,100
Rym: I gotta go back to this.

233
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,707
Scott: Why don't we change the episode?

234
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:36,872
Rym: Maybe instead of food?

235
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:38,580
Rym: We'll talk about where Scott gets his porn.

236
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:43,240
Scott: I don't know because there's a new website you porn calm which is like the YouTube of porn.

237
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,710
Scott: I might go there, but it didn't work the last time I tried it.

238
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:49,079
Scott: It was all crashing and freezing mm-hmm.

239
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,082
Scott: We'll have to see if it's any better now.

240
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,010
Scott: Oh, I got a good thing of the day.

241
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,259
Scott: I was laughing pretty hysterically when I found out about it.

242
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,050
Scott: Uh-huh, so do you know about lemon?

243
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:08,082
Rym: That 24-hour race that's really really really really boring.

244
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:09,025
Scott: well lemon.

245
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:21,761
Scott: I think it's a type of racing I don't know enough about it because I don't care about it But it's endurance racing where they race cars for a long time and they stop and switch drivers And it's all about going fast, but also not having your car break down.

246
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,728
Rym: It's exactly as boring as it sounds.

247
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:27,320
Scott: yeah It's not the most exciting race in the world, but whatever.

248
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:39,088
Scott: but here these guys in California have a race that they run called 24 hours of lemons as in lemons as in lemon cars that are crappy.

249
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:46,215
Scott: and Basically, it's a 24-hour endurance race for cars costing $500 or less.

250
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:51,050
Scott: and this picture is just hilarious looking to these jalopies driving around his track.

251
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:59,568
Rym: And then if you go to this site and read the fact it's even funnier I like how the purses they pay out at the end are paid entirely in nickels.

252
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:05,753
Scott: Yeah It's like everything about this whole race is a complete joke like any Any place.

253
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,002
Scott: they could possibly make something funny.

254
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:08,704
Scott: They did like.

255
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:14,965
Scott: halfway through the race Everyone in the grandstands votes on a car that gets just they're gonna crush it.

256
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:15,989
Scott: they crush it right there.

257
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:18,108
Scott: It's like no you suck you get crushed.

258
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:20,374
Scott: And it's great.

259
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,869
Scott: like on the instructions here, they're like the fact says will I die?

260
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,983
Scott: Maybe safety equipment isn't included in the $500 car purchase price.

261
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:33,166
Scott: You'll have kind of a fighting chance, but this isn't a brilliant thing to be doing.

262
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:33,910
Scott: get used to it.

263
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:36,422
Scott: It's like will my car die?

264
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:37,635
Scott: oh almost definitely Yeah.

265
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:44,103
Scott: And even if it survives on the track Halfway through the race one entry will be chosen by popular ballot for immediate crushing.

266
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:46,350
Scott: could be yours heck it probably will be yours.

267
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:46,470
Scott: be.

268
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:53,690
Scott: The whole rules of this race read like a silly RPG book like it's paranoia or something.

269
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,920
Scott: But it's a car race in California.

270
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,036
Scott: man if I lived in California I would totally go this thing and probably race.

271
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:01,059
Scott: that's so worth 500 bucks.

272
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,644
Scott: I spent $500 on worse things.

273
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:12,770
Scott: Yeah, almost definitely As you know drive around a track in a crappy car everyone else is driving a crappy car.

274
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,476
Scott: You want to see how long you can go.

275
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:16,704
Scott: you want to see how fast you can go?

276
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:18,550
Scott: It's good stuff, right?

277
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,369
Rym: So my thing of the day I stumbled upon this being you know bored at the end of the day at work.

278
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:27,745
Rym: Someone now you might remember the old Mary Worth comic and newspapers.

279
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:28,066
Scott: god.

280
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,110
Scott: I hate all those comics.

281
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:33,329
Rym: It's really a shitty comic and whoever does it is not a cool person at all.

282
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:47,790
Scott: Yeah, it's like you ever if you read the newspaper comics There's the the generic really popular ones then there's some of the more Targeted ones and then there's the boring want to be serious ones Like soap operas of the old school.

283
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,900
Rym: they're not really very serious because there's only three panels a day and No one can actually follow that plot.

284
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,650
Rym: and if you do the plot is shite It's.

285
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:01,989
Scott: it's no different than watching a soap opera on TV only watching such a small part of it.

286
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,798
Rym: The worst part was mean the art was bad and everything.

287
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:14,269
Rym: so a bunch of people got together and they filmed Mary Worth using the dialogue and the framing and the camera angles from the comic.

288
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:17,440
Rym: and I got to say this is a little disturbing to watch.

289
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,790
Rym: you might not want to watch this if you're alone at night.

290
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:27,214
Scott: Yeah, they did it all in black and white and they had the people stand in the poses that they were in the comic frames But not moving.

291
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:31,109
Scott: it is and they put this eerie music on it, and it was kind of freaky.

292
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,104
Rym: If you don't good God is Mary Worth terrible now.

293
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,510
Rym: I would put out a bounty.

294
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,837
Scott: What are those other ones like apartment 3g?

295
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,963
Rym: Yeah, I will put out a bounty Thor.

296
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:43,249
Rym: I will put out a bounty right now.

297
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:48,370
Rym: Anyone who can find someone who earnestly enjoys Mary Worth?

298
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,843
Rym: Get them in my contact get them on this show.

00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:53,826
Rym: We will interview them.

300
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:54,789
Rym: I guarantee it.

301
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,476
Scott: Why don't we get the person who does it?

302
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:57,701
Scott: I'm sure they're not busy.

303
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:00,090
Rym: I don't know if they're even alive.

304
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:04,808
Rym: It's probably just like a couple of syndicated dudes who were hired to keep it going or something.

305
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:06,840
Scott: All right I'm gonna read the Wikipedia on it.

306
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:08,290
Rym: Well, we're not gonna do that now.

307
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,170
Scott: No, I'm not doing it right now, but I meant in the future because I don't care about the person who writes it.

308
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,933
Rym: They do it for money.

309
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:16,830
Rym: I want to hear from someone who reads it who reads that outer drivel.

310
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:18,876
Scott: That's a very good question.

311
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:21,770
Rym: I mean I can understand reading underwear pervert comics.

312
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:27,345
Scott: Yeah, I do understand the underwear forever comics more than I understand Mary Worth.

313
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:28,970
Rym: Plus I've liked a few underwear perverts.

314
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,176
Rym: I mean Batman and you know Batman.

315
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,550
Scott: It's a spider-man.

316
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,255
Rym: No, I don't like spider-man.

317
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:37,319
Scott: Well, it's spider-man.

318
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,462
Rym: I like the spider-man movies.

319
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:40,569
Rym: I hated every spider-man comic I've ever seen.

320
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:43,800
Scott: It's most of them are suck, but there's some good ones.

321
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:46,311
Rym: Yeah, give me one that's good and I'll try to read it All right.

322
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:51,690
Scott: It's usually the ones where it's not actually like the main spider-man book.

323
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:57,868
Scott: It's always like here's spider-man and he's just hanging around town doing something funny cuz he's spider-man.

324
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:59,485
Scott: Uh-huh Those are the ones that I like.

325
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:01,469
Scott: anyway All right.

326
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:10,967
Scott: So today we're gonna talk about I guess we're gonna argue about food because Rym Doesn't like yogurt or milk because he's a heathen and Scott doesn't like anything.

327
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:14,682
Scott: That's good All right, all right.

328
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,257
Rym: So let's start with cream of wheat.

329
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:19,484
Rym: cuz Scott for some reason will eat cream of wheat.

330
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:27,330
Scott: cream of wheat is awesome If it's cold in the winter, you know, you don't want to have a bowl of dry cereal with some cold milk.

331
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,577
Scott: You don't want to eat some cold fruit.

332
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:34,394
Scott: you want to get some nice hot mushy cream of wheat And you don't need oatmeal.

333
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:38,230
Scott: oatmeal is all clumpy and nasty and you know, you want like Quaker oats.

334
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,379
Scott: That's even nastier.

335
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:40,870
Scott: You gotta have cream of wheat.

336
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,198
Scott: It's creamy and weedy and not only that.

337
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:48,850
Scott: but you freakin put some milk and some sugar and some raisins in there.

338
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:52,943
Rym: It's good stuff man, but cream of wheat doesn't taste like anything.

339
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:54,830
Rym: It's the second blandest thing in the world.

340
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:58,249
Scott: That's why you put the sugar and the raisins and the milk in it.

341
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:04,570
Rym: Why not just eat sugar raisins and milk because then it wouldn't be a hot cereal and heat it up?

342
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,859
Scott: If I tend to not you need the highest.

343
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,770
Scott: it's mostly the hot mushy part and it does taste like something.

344
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:12,094
Scott: It tastes like wheat.

345
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:14,402
Scott: It's like eating five you're talking about.

346
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:17,030
Scott: like hearty bread doesn't get any hardier than cream of wheat.

347
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:18,950
Scott: It's like eating five pieces of bread.

348
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,488
Rym: It gets much harder than cream of wheat because cream of wheat is the most processed white bread.

349
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,854
Scott: crap It's not.

350
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:26,862
Scott: you got to get the kind with all the yellow bits in it.

351
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:28,710
Rym: Yeah, it still doesn't taste any different.

352
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:29,333
Scott: It does.

353
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,886
Scott: cream of wheat is just the player is it you haven't had there?

354
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:32,610
Scott: you gotta eat the free.

355
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,383
Rym: Yeah, I've had all sorts of cream of wheat.

356
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:38,349
Rym: when I was in the Cub Scouts They made us eat it every morning because it was the only thing they had at camp.

357
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:42,730
Rym: Yeah, and no matter who made it or what they made it always tasted like nothing.

358
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:44,799
Scott: I'll make you a cream of wheat that doesn't taste like nothing.

359
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,445
Rym: I don't think you can I can.

360
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:56,421
Scott: the trick is some people They put too much water or they don't get rid of enough water and then it's not thick enough and it's all watery and it Tastes like you want something hot and mushy and sweet on a cold day.

361
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:02,617
Rym: have some chocolate, you know cocoa or something Hot cocoa filled with marshmallows.

362
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:03,639
Scott: It's no good.

363
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,682
Scott: It's all sugar.

364
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:06,165
Scott: It's not a breakfast.

365
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:07,148
Scott: That's freaking dessert.

366
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:08,130
Rym: That's a breakfast.

367
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:14,310
Rym: You realize in the I usually eat pumpkin pie for breakfast pretty much from it's also dessert.

368
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,924
Scott: But I don't eat pumpkin from September until December not for eating there for decorating.

369
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,350
Rym: All right, so let's get on this one.

370
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:24,630
Rym: Scott doesn't like pumpkin pie, which is probably the best pie ever conceived on to man.

371
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:27,077
Scott: I've cut open pumpkins.

372
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,201
Scott: I smelled pumpkins.

373
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,184
Scott: I've eaten pumpkin.

374
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:30,790
Scott: pumpkin does not taste good.

375
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:33,108
Scott: It's only use is as an entertainment.

376
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:35,400
Rym: gourd See one or squat.

377
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,630
Scott: I just a gourd or squash.

378
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,059
Rym: I'm pretty sure gourds and squashes are very similar.

379
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,609
Scott: if not, they are similar, but I wonder which one a pumpkin is.

380
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:42,514
Rym: It's a squash.

381
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:43,097
Rym: Okay.

382
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,626
Rym: I just I'm pretty sure.

383
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,008
Rym: I don't know.

384
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:46,697
Scott: You're just deciding.

385
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:56,647
Rym: but here's the thing one cider one pumpkin bread is awesome to pumpkin seeds when roasted are awesome.

386
00:23:56,687 --> 00:24:00,700
Rym: and three Pumpkin pie especially when it's got a lot of nutmeg in.

387
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,628
Rym: it is the most wonderful dessert pie in the world.

388
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:04,370
Scott: I get it.

389
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,561
Scott: It's all about the nutmeg and the hallucinating.

390
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:10,533
Scott: That's why you like it Alrighty.

391
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,221
Scott: so you don't really like pumpkin pie.

392
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,850
Scott: you like nutmeg pie.

393
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:28,709
Rym: Actually one thing I'll notice that the best pumpkin of I ever had and I'm not kidding here was one that Emily's mom made Over a Thanksgiving because she used a different amount of nutmeg and there were some other spices in it And it was just a really freaking good pumpkin pie.

394
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:34,950
Rym: Yeah, I'm not a fan of eating pumpkin, but you won't eat strawberry rhubarb the second greatest pie ever made either.

395
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:36,036
Scott: I'll eat strawberry.

396
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:38,128
Scott: strawberries are awesome and I'm eating rhubarb.

397
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,270
Rym: But you see you can't have a strawberry pie without rhubarb because rhubarb adds the bite.

398
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:44,778
Scott: You can just not eat rhubarb.

399
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:47,305
Scott: you can have a strawberry apple pie what?

400
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:47,767
Rym: that's not.

401
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:48,890
Rym: that's nothing compared to strawberry.

402
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,078
Scott: We have a strawberry banana pie.

403
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:52,845
Rym: That would be terrible be awesome.

404
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:54,755
Rym: Can't make a banana pie Why not?

405
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:56,289
Rym: Have you ever seen a banana pie?

406
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:58,616
Scott: No, but we should make.

407
00:24:58,736 --> 00:25:01,610
Rym: there's a reason why bananas don't bake.

408
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,386
Rym: Well, I think banana bread banana bread is not banana.

409
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:07,309
Scott: What do you mean?

410
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:07,650
Scott: Of course?

411
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:13,364
Rym: Alright you take a banana and try to bake it and see what happens to it.

412
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,070
Scott: I can freakin bake a banana pie.

413
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:18,398
Rym: I'll take you up on that.

414
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:20,149
Rym: I don't think you could I could do it.

415
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,018
Scott: I'll get a little.

416
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,050
Scott: get a generic pie.

417
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:26,150
Rym: I think you can make a banana cream pie, but you couldn't just make a banana pie with slices.

418
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,016
Scott: Oh, you know you strawberry cream pie.

419
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:32,010
Rym: Mmm strawberry cream pie is very good, but it's got nothing on strawberry rhubarb.

420
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,275
Scott: Rhubarb is ass.

421
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:34,460
Scott: it is not meant to be eaten.

422
00:25:34,661 --> 00:25:34,841
Rym: Yes.

423
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:35,243
Rym: It is.

424
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:38,215
Rym: What is not just have to cook it properly So it's not poisonous anymore.

425
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:40,845
Scott: Yeah, it's not meant to be eaten.

426
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:41,909
Scott: It doesn't taste good.

427
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:45,718
Scott: It's just like brown hard nastiness.

428
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:46,320
Rym: It's not brown.

429
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,862
Rym: It's red.

430
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:47,825
Scott: Whatever.

431
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:48,848
Scott: It's reddish brown.

432
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:49,450
Scott: It's not good.

433
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:56,889
Rym: See a strawberry pie would be okay, but the rhubarb adds this kick to it that really pushes it beyond the realm of mortal food.

434
00:25:58,044 --> 00:26:03,681
Scott: Um Yeah, because you die when you eat the poison rhubarb, that's why it's not mortal food.

435
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,130
Rym: Okay, except the fact that you don't die.

436
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:10,513
Scott: Yeah, you do Okay.

437
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:11,156
Scott: Anyway, Mr.

438
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:12,081
Scott: Rhubarb is ass.

439
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:12,343
Rym: Mr.

440
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:13,649
Rym: Hotshot bring up a food.

441
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:18,248
Scott: Yeah, freakin what it's the hell with you not drinking milk the most necessary thing to drink.

442
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:23,710
Rym: All right I'm a mammal and once mammals reach the age of majority, they don't need milk anymore.

443
00:26:24,594 --> 00:26:25,850
Scott: Yeah, okay, okay.

444
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:28,659
Scott: But then why don't you stop eating?

445
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,050
Scott: I don't know other things that you only ate when you were a kid.

446
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:34,681
Rym: I stopped eating a lot of the things I ate when I was a kid.

447
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:36,810
Rym: I almost never eat candy anymore.

448
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,678
Scott: Well, I don't eat candy so much either.

449
00:26:38,738 --> 00:26:41,410
Scott: but you know, you look at animals in the wild.

450
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:45,942
Scott: They generally eat the same shit when they're you know throughout all their ages.

451
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:48,910
Scott: Yeah, except change their diets based on age.

452
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,797
Rym: Yeah, they do.

453
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:51,209
Rym: They all stop drinking milk.

454
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:55,425
Rym: All mammals stop drinking milk except humans who have cows.

455
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:58,139
Rym: and we drink cows milk Yeah, but they all.

456
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,190
Scott: everything else stays exactly the same.

457
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:02,809
Scott: What does it matter if you stick with milk or not?

458
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,982
Scott: Just because because it does other animals don't have ways of producing other things.

459
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,294
Rym: my body tricks me every now then because sometimes I'll have A whole bunch of candy.

460
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:13,690
Scott: if you want to make that argument, maybe you should just you know only eat.

461
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,220
Scott: But you know that you would get if you were like a caveman.

462
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:20,390
Rym: see the thing is I'm an omnivore so I could eat anything.

463
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:27,289
Scott: Yeah, well if you're a caveman and oh, you know and you're a natural living in the wild human You would only eat nuts berries and raw meat.

464
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:28,373
Rym: You know what?

465
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,945
Rym: I would really like to eat almost nothing but raw meat fine.

466
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,570
Scott: No more strawberry rhubarb pies.

467
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:38,330
Rym: Just strawberry nuts and Rami Strawberry rhubarb pie out in the wilderness.

468
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:45,615
Scott: No, no, no, not if you're a caveman or a dumb animal who doesn't know how to get milk after you know But their mom is.

469
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:47,040
Rym: I'm not a caveman anymore.

470
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,608
Scott: I'm a human being and that's why you can fucking drink milk.

471
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:51,274
Rym: Well, I could.

472
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:53,281
Rym: milk tastes like crap.

473
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:54,586
Scott: milk tastes great.

474
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,790
Rym: It's filling and fatty.

475
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:57,964
Scott: That's exactly why it's great.

476
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:58,690
Scott: fat tastes good.

477
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:01,908
Rym: Milk doesn't taste good though milk tastes great.

478
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:04,436
Scott: Milk is like the most refreshing thing.

479
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:14,112
Rym: I mean you eat like a cake or a chocolate chip cookie or anything I've noticed because every now and then I'll eat a whole bunch of chocolate cake or something I'll be like.

480
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:16,280
Rym: I have a person girl cookies.

481
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:17,305
Rym: cookies are nasty.

482
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:18,590
Scott: Some of them are so all of them.

483
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,159
Rym: I can't stand them anymore.

484
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,285
Scott: No, it's all about the regular.

485
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:23,382
Scott: the trefoils are good Now when I've been mince are okay.

486
00:28:23,422 --> 00:28:30,878
Rym: when I was a little kid I like Girl Scout cookies, but now I've grown up and I try to eat him and All of them except for the shortbread ones.

487
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,881
Scott: That's the trefoil.

488
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:32,704
Rym: I know tastes like.

489
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,490
Rym: tastes like processed crap.

490
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:36,809
Rym: It's like corn syrup and fat and lard.

491
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:40,330
Scott: Well, the thin mint ones are okay, but the trefoil ones are by far the best.

492
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:46,036
Rym: They're actually pretty crappy compared to real shortbread cookies And whatever you ever had.

493
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:50,490
Scott: real shortbread cookies like fresh ones don't really care a cookie is a cookie.

494
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:51,418
Rym: Wait a minute.

495
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,266
Rym: a cookie is a cookie.

496
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:53,633
Scott: Pretty much.

497
00:28:53,734 --> 00:29:07,769
Rym: So the only way a cookie can get better is by being hotter or squishier Alright, so if a cookie is a cookie then if I go to the store and get myself a cajun cookie It'll be exactly the same as a fresh-baked mama rose cookie.

498
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:09,917
Scott: No, it's not the same.

499
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:12,670
Rym: but you just said it cookies a cookie different kind of cookie.

500
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,421
Rym: No, they're the same cookie a cajun cookie or a mama rose cookie.

501
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:17,986
Scott: Those are two different cookies.

502
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:21,200
Rym: No, they're not a Cajun cookie is just a mama rose cookie.

503
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,386
Rym: That's been left out a while.

504
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:23,009
Scott: Why?

505
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,730
Scott: What is up with you and these weird ass kind of cookie?

506
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,003
Scott: It's like you like any food.

507
00:29:29,044 --> 00:29:29,590
Scott: that's weird.

508
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:30,474
Scott: It's not.

509
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:34,209
Scott: if it's a it's a weird food that something out of the norm rims like.

510
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:36,416
Scott: ooh I like weird food just cuz it's weird.

511
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,001
Rym: I don't like cajun cookies.

512
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,727
Rym: cajun cookies the worst thing ever.

513
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:43,542
Scott: I don't care I'm just saying you just like weird things for the sake of the weirdness.

514
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:44,024
Scott: All right.

515
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:45,530
Rym: All right, I'll bite like what?

516
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,232
Rym: What do I like?

517
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:52,032
Rym: that's weird that I like for the sake of liking it pretty much everything you eat You.

518
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:57,830
Scott: also whenever you cook something you will add like a bajillion spices just for the sake of adding a bajillion spices.

519
00:29:58,499 --> 00:29:59,190
Rym: Alright, like what?

520
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:05,030
Rym: I mean if I make a grilled cheese Nothing makes a grilled cheese better than having some dill sprinkled in with the butter on the outside.

521
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:07,178
Scott: No, that's generally not a good.

522
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:10,310
Scott: where have you ever seen anyone do that, but you restaurants?

523
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:13,830
Scott: What restaurant puts dill in the butter on a grilled cheese sandwich?

524
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,289
Rym: I've seen a lot of donners put dill on the grilled cheese.

525
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:20,530
Scott: I never heard of such a thing and never seen such a thing ever or what else.

526
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,270
Rym: Well, I mean what things do I add spices to that?

527
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,557
Rym: You don't like me adding spices to.

528
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:32,252
Scott: pretty much any time you cook a tomato sauce You take every spice that we have in the cabinet and dump it in there and then the tomato sauce is basically just a spice Mush.

529
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:35,570
Rym: actually, all I put in is paprika usually and I don't even put in that much.

530
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,982
Scott: Well, you're not putting in enough because you do got to put something in there.

531
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:41,790
Rym: Yeah, I put paprika in there?

532
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,596
Scott: No, it's usually not the net thing.

533
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:45,182
Scott: You need to put in so much of.

534
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:47,450
Scott: you generally need more garlic powder in there.

535
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:48,373
Scott: That's what you need.

536
00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:51,383
Rym: All right, but I thought I wasn't supposed to put stuff in.

537
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:56,830
Scott: you are but you put way too much stuff You know like throw spices and all kinds of crazy stuff.

538
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:01,110
Scott: I think you might as well just eat the spice because the way you put spice on all the other flavors are destroyed.

539
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:08,560
Rym: I think this argument comes out of the fact that Scott makes effectively McDonald's eggs make McDonald's eggs.

540
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,905
Rym: That's idea of cooking eggs is?

541
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:11,050
Rym: he'll beat him up, right?

542
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,374
Rym: He'll just beat him up straight.

543
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,343
Rym: doesn't add milk or water or anything.

544
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:15,649
Scott: I thought you didn't like milk.

545
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:18,840
Rym: I don't like drinking milk, but milk is useful for cooking.

546
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,345
Scott: Well, but you're a mammal.

547
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:21,068
Scott: you you're.

548
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:21,590
Scott: you're done.

549
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:22,788
Scott: You shouldn't ingest milk.

550
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:27,310
Rym: No, that wasn't my argument wasn't that I shouldn't because that my argument was that that is a funny argument.

551
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,410
Rym: The actual argument is that drinking milk is not a fun thing and it doesn't taste good.

552
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:39,670
Rym: It refreshes the palate after a dessert, you know, what refreshes the palate much more after dessert some wine or a cold beer?

553
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:46,229
Scott: Yeah, I think you just you're like those people who like drinking wine because you know, you like being all wine and froofy.

554
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:48,090
Rym: I really like wine.

555
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,357
Scott: You like being all froofy.

556
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:52,202
Rym: I don't think I like being all wine.

557
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:53,747
Scott: It just tastes like bad grape juice.

558
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:57,560
Rym: Yeah Yeah, you've never actually had good wine though.

559
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:00,070
Rym: The only wine you've ever had is Meinischewitz and Hobo wine.

560
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:03,525
Scott: Oh, yeah, I drank some other crazy wine once.

561
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:04,750
Scott: It just tasted worse.

562
00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:07,138
Rym: You drank that mead, but that mead was bad.

563
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,162
Rym: That mead was.

564
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:10,390
Scott: you gave me something once like way back at RIT.

565
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:15,930
Rym: Yeah at RIT I bought this bottle of mead and we all opened it up and we all tried it and it tasted like an open asshole.

566
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,475
Scott: I think there's another time.

567
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,304
Scott: I drank like some white wine and it tasted bad.

568
00:32:20,324 --> 00:32:21,648
Rym: Mead was whitish.

569
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:29,948
Scott: Whatever the point is White wine, especially white wine, but also fancy red wine is bad.

570
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,107
Scott: I mean white grape juice is bad enough and I can read I can eat a green grape.

571
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:38,983
Scott: a green grape is All right, not as good as a red grape, but good enough.

572
00:32:39,506 --> 00:32:41,881
Scott: and a grape juice That's you know, red grape juice.

573
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:46,682
Scott: that tastes good, too But white wine is just bad.

574
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:48,890
Scott: It doesn't taste like grapes.

575
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:51,269
Scott: It tastes just like bad water.

576
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:55,603
Rym: See, I don't know where you're coming from because white wine is fantastic.

577
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:57,910
Rym: I really like a good German ice wine.

578
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:59,775
Scott: It tastes like bad fruit water.

579
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:00,357
Rym: No, it doesn't.

580
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:03,205
Rym: it tastes like ice wine and those kinds of things.

581
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:04,970
Rym: tastes like really sweet like Rieslings.

582
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:12,303
Rym: Whatever you just like knowing all those fancy names I need to know the names so I know what to buy.

583
00:33:12,403 --> 00:33:15,476
Rym: like if I try a wine and I like it I remember you just know you you like.

584
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:18,990
Scott: just you know to know them and to say them so that other people go.

585
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:26,090
Scott: Oh, he knows the names of the fancy, you know, it's that whole wine culture of except it's not because that wine culture is bullshit.

586
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:28,516
Scott: Yeah, but you're you're all into it.

587
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:29,919
Scott: Even then you say it's bullshit.

588
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:30,380
Scott: It's easy.

589
00:33:31,062 --> 00:33:37,029
Scott: being it being in something and saying it's bullshit is called Good job.

590
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:39,754
Rym: It's like if I go.

591
00:33:39,814 --> 00:33:42,345
Scott: oh man all this psychic shit is bullshit, let me read your mind man.

592
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:42,646
Rym: see.

593
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:49,429
Rym: now the problem here Scott is that that was a straw man and more importantly in terms of straw man He has no brain.

594
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:59,211
Rym: It seems to me that your argument with food with me Oh with everyone cuz you've made the same argument to other people before is that if anyone in the world like something that you don't Like.

595
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:03,967
Rym: then you assume that they like it for some stupid reason that they don't actually know.

596
00:34:04,027 --> 00:34:07,919
Scott: not everything It's only things that are you know weird.

597
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,362
Rym: what wine is not weird?

598
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:14,190
Rym: wine was the staple of drink for thousands of years of human existence.

599
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:22,106
Scott: Yeah, it's not just not weird It's weird to have all these different strange, you know varieties of water.

600
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:23,150
Rym: not strange.

601
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:28,469
Rym: They only sound strange to you because they're in other languages because they come from those countries.

602
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:31,851
Rym: It's called ice wine because it's German Bet.

603
00:34:31,913 --> 00:34:32,393
Scott: if all those?

604
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:37,710
Scott: if they didn't have if the wines didn't have fancy names if they actually named them like why number one?

605
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:38,638
Scott: Why number two?

606
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,989
Scott: why number three or something?

607
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,274
Scott: You know like that it.

608
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:47,493
Scott: I'm saying the marketing of the wine and the labeling of the wine is a huge effect on you and your Psychology.

609
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:48,536
Rym: no, it doesn't.

610
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:51,730
Rym: Yeah, you know what has a huge effect on me the way a wine tastes?

611
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:55,030
Rym: No, I don't think so because you realize the names of wines.

612
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,690
Rym: It's not like marketers came up with them.

613
00:34:57,211 --> 00:35:03,470
Rym: We're gonna call this wine a Merlot and we're gonna call this wine a Chianti and we're gonna call this wine.

614
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,210
Rym: I want you to call it a Hebrew.

615
00:35:06,643 --> 00:35:14,073
Scott: You know I should do is you take wines and like take them out of the bottles and switch them into different bottles and see if you Can tell.

616
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:15,522
Scott: I don't think you good.

617
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:16,890
Rym: I can tell the difference.

618
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:18,879
Rym: I mean here's the thing I've had.

619
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:27,242
Scott: so like if you went to the store and you bought a Merlot and there was actually Something else in that bottle and it wasn't a Merlot you wouldn't freakin know.

620
00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:29,970
Scott: I just like oh, this is an excellent Merlot.

621
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:35,550
Rym: See actually probably not because my Merlots taste a pretty general way.

622
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:42,939
Rym: And if it didn't taste like that, it probably tastes pretty bad and I'd go Yeah, this isn't good and I just pour the bottle out.

623
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,324
Scott: Well, it wouldn't be something bad.

624
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:46,310
Scott: It would be some other wine.

625
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:47,556
Scott: It just that was good.

626
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:50,190
Scott: It just wouldn't be a Merlot would be some other wine.

627
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:53,149
Scott: I can't I don't know any names but you get the point.

628
00:35:53,916 --> 00:36:00,190
Rym: See I can tell the difference between the wines I like like but I can't tell the difference between most wines because I don't know enough about it.

629
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,137
Rym: But like Merlot's I've had a whole bunch.

630
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:03,141
Rym: so I can kind of tell.

631
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:07,198
Rym: and if I drink like Alsatian wines I drink a lot of those because I like them.

632
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,390
Rym: so I could tell if you gave me just some crap.

633
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:21,629
Rym: Oh white wine when I expected another one, but if you gave me Watch your blah blah blah or versus a blah blah blah blah And I don't drink those much if at all then I couldn't tell I probably wouldn't know.

634
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,041
Scott: And it's a whole culture.

635
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:25,189
Scott: wine is no good.

636
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:26,474
Scott: It's all I'm saying.

637
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:29,505
Rym: but you realize the names come from, you know, ancient practice.

638
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:30,870
Scott: It's not about the names.

639
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,294
Rym: So what's it about?

640
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:33,378
Rym: What's wrong with wine?

641
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:34,783
Scott: It's about the fight that you had.

642
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:36,529
Scott: just like it because it's good.

643
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,839
Rym: I like it purely because it tastes good.

644
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:39,803
Scott: It doesn't taste good.

645
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,406
Scott: Yeah, it does.

646
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:41,270
Scott: It doesn't see that.

647
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:46,870
Scott: I think you I think You know, it starts out where you like it because you want to like it.

648
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,144
Scott: So you get into it and then I decide that it tastes good.

649
00:36:50,184 --> 00:36:57,470
Scott: you change your own mind To make you so that you like what you want to like and then you actually like it afterwards.

650
00:36:57,771 --> 00:36:58,394
Scott: You don't like it.

651
00:36:58,414 --> 00:37:02,309
Rym: to begin with you make this argument to almost everyone who likes things that you don't like.

652
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:04,963
Scott: No, it's not just when you like things that I don't like.

653
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:12,116
Scott: there are things you like that I also like or things that I we both don't like And it's the same thing.

654
00:37:12,478 --> 00:37:13,341
Rym: see don't freak.

655
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:19,070
Rym: when I first had communion because I went to a Catholic school They made us do all that stuff and we had to eat the little Jesus cookie.

656
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:26,778
Rym: And then we got to drink some red wine out of this giant gold chalice and everyone drank out of the same chalice Which is kind of horrible now that I'm older.

657
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:27,782
Scott: Yeah, that is kind of hard.

658
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:29,730
Rym: I'm glad I didn't get tuberculosis or something.

659
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,589
Scott: Oh shit.

660
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:44,062
Rym: But the thing is it tasted really really good and I got in trouble because whenever communion came I'd tip the thing up in the priest's hand and drink as much as I could and I've always liked wine from the first time I ever had it.

661
00:37:44,082 --> 00:37:45,750
Rym: Yeah, same with soda.

662
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:53,943
Rym: I remember the day my mom gave me a small glass of dr Pepper with ice cubes in it and it was like ambrosia.

663
00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:55,308
Rym: and from that day forth.

664
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:59,888
Rym: I drank dr Pepper almost every day and in fact in high school, I would drink five or six cans a day.

665
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:05,390
Scott: every day I drank a can of soda when I was a kid and it hurt my mouth and it was poisonous.

666
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:06,995
Scott: It tasted like acid.

667
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:07,918
Scott: that was just all right.

668
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:08,179
Rym: All right.

669
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,045
Rym: So here's something you don't like soda.

670
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:11,510
Scott: So it is poison.

671
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,293
Scott: I don't drink it.

672
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:13,398
Rym: How is it poison?

673
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,322
Scott: Number one?

674
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:15,447
Scott: The carbonation hurts.

675
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:18,323
Rym: number two I gotta back that up here.

676
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:20,735
Rym: the Carbonation hurts.

677
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:22,139
Scott: it does so.

678
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,750
Rym: you're saying that carbonated beverages in some way harm you.

679
00:38:26,312 --> 00:38:26,936
Scott: They don't.

680
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:29,190
Scott: they make it my mouth feel pain.

681
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:31,758
Rym: That's not normal.

682
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:33,546
Scott: It's not normal about it.

683
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:40,050
Rym: Um Do you do you think that everyone else feels pain when they drink soda, I think they just I don't know.

684
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,812
Scott: Maybe they like it.

685
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:43,459
Rym: There's no pain when you drink soda.

686
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,522
Rym: It doesn't hurt.

687
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,585
Scott: It stings.

688
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:46,628
Rym: No, it doesn't.

689
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:47,250
Scott: Yeah, it does.

690
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:48,374
Rym: No, it does.

691
00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:50,422
Rym: I just had some tonic water.

692
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:51,184
Rym: It doesn't sting.

693
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:52,650
Rym: You know, what stings the quinine?

694
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:55,556
Scott: whatever It stings.

695
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:58,628
Scott: never drink carbonated beverage, even a lightly carbonated one.

696
00:38:58,648 --> 00:39:01,236
Scott: it goes And then it goes away.

697
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:03,202
Rym: see to me carbonation is very refreshing.

698
00:39:03,523 --> 00:39:04,466
Scott: no, it's no good.

699
00:39:04,948 --> 00:39:05,770
Scott: All right, it's annoying.

700
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,916
Scott: I want to taste the beverage.

701
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:09,409
Scott: I don't want to have all these poisonous bubbles in my mouth.

702
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:11,049
Rym: So why don't you drink some flat soda?

703
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,459
Scott: Because it tastes like ass.

704
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:15,209
Rym: what kinds of soda have you had flat?

705
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:20,081
Scott: I think I had flat ginger ale and had diarrhea ones.

706
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:21,345
Rym: flat ginger ale is great.

707
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:22,810
Scott: It tasted like bad water.

708
00:39:24,151 --> 00:39:26,420
Rym: Okay, so apparently wine and pop taste the same.

709
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,790
Rym: They taste like bad water to you or bad grape juice?

710
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:38,437
Scott: and Well, it was bad in a different way okay, and the Soda tasted like freakin acid.

711
00:39:38,457 --> 00:39:42,510
Scott: He was uh, I don't know how anyone drinks that shit cuz it tastes great.

712
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:43,696
Scott: No, it doesn't.

713
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,621
Scott: it tastes bad.

714
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:50,450
Rym: In fact, as soon as we stop recording this I'm gonna go drink some Tom Collins mixer with some ice over it while I do the post-production.

715
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:51,935
Scott: Yeah, drunky.

716
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:54,844
Rym: Uh, there's no alcohol in Tom Collins.

717
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:55,626
Rym: It's just odd.

718
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:56,750
Rym: It tastes kind of like squirt.

719
00:39:57,874 --> 00:39:58,937
Scott: What the hell is squirt?

720
00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:01,325
Rym: squirt is a soda I haven't seen for sale in a long time.

721
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:04,618
Rym: the closest thing I found to it Is Tom Collins, so I drink that instead.

722
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:05,240
Scott: Here's the point.

723
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:06,647
Scott: You're just drinking weird stuff.

724
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:09,353
Scott: because you like drinking I like squirt.

725
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:10,015
Rym: It's a citrus.

726
00:40:10,055 --> 00:40:10,957
Rym: It's just citrus.

727
00:40:11,238 --> 00:40:16,110
Scott: It's a citrus drink, but you're like, oh, I'm drinking a Tom Collins something fancy.

728
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:17,496
Rym: It's not fancy.

729
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,144
Rym: It was 99 cents.

730
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:20,309
Rym: I bought like 10 of them.

731
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:23,541
Scott: The point is it's something out of the ordinary.

732
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:24,164
Rym: It's not.

733
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:25,410
Rym: it's a common drink.

734
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,576
Rym: Squirt was just this brand.

735
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:31,550
Scott: When was the last time you heard anyone say I'm gonna drink me some Tom Collins mixer?

736
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:40,214
Rym: Actually when we were at the concert someone ordered a gin and Tom Collins AKA a gin Collins.

737
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:42,482
Scott: I'd never even heard of Tom Collins before in my life.

738
00:40:42,703 --> 00:40:44,650
Rym: Actually, I looked up on Wikipedia.

739
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:48,974
Rym: That's how I found out what it was and then I bought a bunch Because someone I heard it.

740
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:55,501
Rym: so then you I go and I look at Wikipedia and it's the same as squirt and I really liked Squirt, but I haven't seen it for sale in a long time.

741
00:40:55,742 --> 00:40:57,110
Rym: So I bought it and it tastes like squirt.

742
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:59,469
Rym: So now I got one of my favorite sodas back.

743
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:05,348
Rym: Now if only I could get myself a big pile of some Faygo red pop, I'd be good to go.

744
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:16,049
Scott: Yeah Yeah, just great all these poisonous as a rocket Didn't you just eat normal food mainstream normal run-of-the-mill food.

745
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:20,403
Rym: Are you saying that soda pop is not mainstream?

746
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:22,330
Rym: I think most Americans drink it.

747
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:27,567
Scott: I'm saying is that why don't you just drink, you know Coke and Pepsi and dr.

748
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:28,610
Scott: Pepper in the normal ones?

749
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,556
Scott: Why do you do a weird soda?

750
00:41:30,837 --> 00:41:31,500
Rym: Um, dr.

751
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,260
Rym: My favorite sodas are pretty much any cream soda Any real root beer dr.

752
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:39,370
Rym: Pepper, which is like my favorite soda ever.

753
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,199
Rym: I've drunk it my whole life and I still drink it.

754
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:45,199
Rym: and then like things like squirt I used to like seven up, but I don't anymore.

755
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,310
Scott: I drink water juice and milk.

756
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,144
Rym: That's it, but you don't even drink a lot of juices.

757
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:51,370
Scott: I drink a lot of juices.

758
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,079
Scott: I drink more juices than anything else.

759
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,869
Rym: You don't seem to want to drink my pomegranate juice.

760
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:59,510
Scott: It's cuz I'm gonna eat a pomegranate and I'm gonna drink pomegranate juice.

761
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,537
Rym: When was the last time you ate a pomegranate?

762
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:02,982
Scott: Six years ago.

763
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:04,186
Scott: It's hard to get a pomegranate.

764
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:05,330
Scott: They sell them in the store.

765
00:42:05,531 --> 00:42:06,958
Scott: They're not good the ones in the store.

766
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:09,070
Scott: Okay, you got to get them right off the frickin tree.

767
00:42:09,971 --> 00:42:11,930
Rym: Alright, so I'll go find a pomegranate tree.

768
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,962
Rym: See you can get the juice and it'll be fresh.

769
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:15,150
Rym: because the juice was science.

770
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:21,654
Scott: Yeah, but the juice it doesn't taste the same because eating the pomegranate is all about the brainy bits in the middle of it That are all warbly.

771
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:22,076
Rym: All right.

772
00:42:22,116 --> 00:42:22,798
Rym: So, all right.

773
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:23,340
Rym: Here's the food.

774
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,210
Rym: Scott eats brain and I'm really I don't like it so much.

775
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:27,893
Scott: What am I eating?

776
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:28,455
Scott: the brain?

777
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:31,265
Rym: Yeah, that's just an inside joke from RIT.

778
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,328
Scott: Yeah, it is Scott.

779
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:34,558
Rym: Yeah, what's your brain eating habit?

780
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:36,306
Rym: You gotta stop the monkey brain eater.

781
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:36,989
Scott: you did it.

782
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,167
Rym: That wasn't funny.

783
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:41,376
Rym: That wasn't funny at all.

784
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:42,521
Scott: You're not funny.

785
00:42:43,224 --> 00:42:48,284
Rym: Your mom's not funny If you can't tell we had nothing for the show today.

786
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,410
Scott: We had nothing at all.

787
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:51,369
Scott: We decided this is the worst show ever.

788
00:42:51,772 --> 00:43:00,570
Rym: we decided before the show that we were gonna pick a stupid topic and Argue about it as seriously as we could and get as mean as we could but we're tired.

789
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,937
Rym: So we couldn't actually get that mean.

790
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,650
Scott: yet today is just one of those days.

791
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,742
Scott: We're sitting around like what are we gonna do the show on?

792
00:43:06,762 --> 00:43:08,170
Scott: I don't even want to do a show.

793
00:43:08,553 --> 00:43:10,610
Scott: I don't know what the hell we're gonna do a show on at all.

794
00:43:11,072 --> 00:43:11,513
Scott: I don't know.

795
00:43:11,574 --> 00:43:15,168
Scott: Let's just talk about nothing for some time and then give up.

796
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:18,158
Rym: Yep And we're too tired even be funny about it.

797
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,988
Scott: So yeah, I just want to go to bed.

798
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:27,910
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so the thing is we didn't want to pick a real argument topic because that doesn't work when we're tired.

799
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:33,490
Rym: I mean if we were trying to argue about philosophy or something, it would have just evolved into well the same thing.

800
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,064
Rym: This one devolved into your mom.

801
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:36,594
Scott: See the thing.

802
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:40,190
Scott: it'd be so much easier right if we were like Gabe and Tyco.

803
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:43,470
Scott: They just have to make like a three panel comic three times a week.

804
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:50,030
Scott: So they have you know time to like prepare for it and it's there, you know, even when it wasn't their job.

805
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,845
Scott: You know, you can edit the comic put it up later in the day.

806
00:43:53,966 --> 00:44:01,097
Scott: earlier in the day We get home from work and we have to eat dinner Do shit around the house

807
00:44:01,157 --> 00:44:03,606
Rym: watch anime play video games play board games

808
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:14,143
Scott: have fun Cook dinner, right and Then we have to sit down for an hour and do the show And then we got to sit down for an hour and put the show

809
00:44:14,244 --> 00:44:15,509
Rym: up which would be fine.

810
00:44:15,932 --> 00:44:23,189
Rym: I said that we both have two hours of commute every day and Every single goddamn weekend we go out of town or something crazy happens.

811
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:25,410
Scott: Yeah, so we don't have a topic for a show.

812
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,981
Scott: We're gonna lose a lot of time just thinking to the topic.

813
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:32,641
Scott: and if we have to actually prepare for the show Oh forget that we're in trouble.

814
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:35,876
Rym: instead of preparing for tonight's show Or doing anything constructive.

815
00:44:36,157 --> 00:44:39,310
Rym: We played every single level of outlaw.

816
00:44:40,336 --> 00:44:42,534
Scott: sorry Yeah, outlaw.

817
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,422
Rym: Yeah, Scott beat me two out of 17 times.

818
00:44:45,603 --> 00:44:47,168
Scott: No, it wasn't 17 times.

819
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:48,332
Rym: That was 17.

820
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:49,616
Scott: I don't think it was 17.

821
00:44:49,616 --> 00:44:50,560
Rym: You want me to list him off?

822
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,567
Rym: It was unlimited ammo cactus.

823
00:44:52,587 --> 00:44:53,290
Rym: That's invincible.

824
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:55,710
Rym: unlimited ammo cactus is not invincible.

Rym: I could keep going.

830
00:45:08,232 --> 00:45:10,460
Scott: I was gonna see how long you would go before you gave up.

831
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:13,108
Rym: I could keep going all the stagecoaches.

832
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:15,820

877
00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:32,837
Rym: all right And I'll pay attention this might take a while Actually, I read the entire Wikipedia on Andy Kaufman today all right Cool, yeah, what did it say?

880
00:47:39,582 --> 00:47:43,949

885
00:47:55,874 --> 00:48:01,080
Rym: yeah, of course all the other stuff was fake So it's hard to tell with him what he really did and what he was just making up.

886
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,040
Scott: Yeah, it's like he faked other people, but then he got faked himself.
