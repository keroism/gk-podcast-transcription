1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,900
Rym: So continuing on with our kind of brand new series, Profiles in Geek, or I don't know, maybe we'll rename it, I'm not sure.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:15,320
Rym: We're here with one of our friend podcasters, and it's one of the few podcasts out there we actually listen to, so take heed.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
Rym: This is Gerald from Anime World Order.

4
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,438
Guest: Hey guys, what's up?

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,911
Guest: Woo, alright.

6
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:21,580
Guest: Alright, Gerald.

7
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:27,694
Scott: So Gerald, we just said that we listened to the Anime World Order.

8
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:29,360
Scott: Do you listen to the GeekNights?

9
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:31,603
Guest: Yes, I do occasionally.

10
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:39,640
Guest: Because my job is largely sitting in front of a computer all day, podcasts are kind of how I make it through the day.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,015
Guest: Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:41,471
Guest: Yeah.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,297
Rym: See, I can pull the card of, "But I listen to all of Anime World

14
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:45,759
Rym: Order!".

15
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:52,880
Guest: It's so hard to listen to all of us since we come out with an episode a month or so.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,110
Rym: I know, god, it's like I'll hit iTunes, like, "Oh, they updated!

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:56,572
Rym: Download,

18
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:56,933
Rym: listen!".

19
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:57,615
Rym: And then that's it.

20
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:59,100
Rym: It's done, and now I gotta wait.

21
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:08,047
Scott: But I guess in some ways it makes it sort of, you know, special, where like you'll actually listen to all of them because it's like a rare treat, whereas GeekNights is like, "There's so

22
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:08,448
Scott: much!".

23
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:11,419
Scott: So you don't feel bad, you know, not eating, you know, eating all of it.

24
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,420
Guest: I don't know.

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,112
Guest: Yeah, how many episodes do you guys have now?

26
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:14,575
Guest: Like, 100-something?

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:15,946
Rym: 490-something.

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:16,971
Rym: A lot.

29
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:18,708
Guest: Okay.

30
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:19,214
Guest: That's a lot.

31
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:19,640
Guest: Yeah.

32
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:24,640
Scott: That's why I marked them with dates instead of numbers, so I wouldn't get scared.

33
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:34,380
Rym: Well, also because the ID3 version 1 only lets you have three digits in the podcast or number episode field, so we realized early on we couldn't go with that.

34
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:35,524
Scott: Yep.

35
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:38,720
Scott: Alright, so if you do listen to GeekNights, how did you discover the GeekNights?

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,020
Guest: I'm pretty sure I found it through when Daryl met you at, was it Katsucon?

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,313
Rym: It was Katsucon two or three years ago.

38
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,219
Rym: I forget which Katsucon.

39
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,479
Scott: I think it was four years ago because I think you went, you didn't go.

40
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:53,343
Rym: No, it was.

41
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,959
Rym: Yeah, because it was one of the Katsucons where I drank, which was every Katsucon, but the most recent one.

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,319
Guest: Yeah, Daryl insists that you had short hair then.

43
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,039
Scott: No, that's... Rama has had long hair since I've known him, which is since 2000.

44
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,759
Rym: I've had long hair since 10th grade.

45
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,776
Scott: Yeah, so Daryl is...

46
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:15,360
Rym: I did, however, still have the mustache.

47
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,819
Scott: He did have the stache.

48
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:18,620
Rym: And I was, I remember very specifically...

49
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,360
Guest: Maybe that was a beard time, actually.

50
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:27,580
Rym: I might have had a beard because that whenever I was drunk, the times when I'm drunk, I tend to have beards, but I was quite drunk when I met Daryl.

51
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,936
Guest: Maybe he was mistaking the beard for hair.

52
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:33,199
Scott: Maybe he thought it was someone else.

53
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:33,780
Scott: I don't know.

54
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:38,100
Rym: I wasn't sure what to make of Daryl because he came over to me and showed a microphone in my face.

55
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,400
Rym: He's like, I'm a podcaster, blah, blah, blah.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,957
Rym: And I was like, well, I'm a podcaster too.

57
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:45,667
Scott: I wasn't there.

58
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:47,260
Scott: So this story is still funny to me.

59
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,540
Scott: Because didn't you have Scott Johnson's like tape recorder?

60
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:51,283
Rym: I did.

61
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,129
Rym: And I couldn't.

62
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:53,640
Rym: actually, it was the worst thing ever.

63
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:57,640
Rym: I got drunk and decided I was going to be a real podcaster journalist.

64
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,200
Rym: So I went around interviewing people at the convention, but I was drunk.

65
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,240
Rym: So this tape was this rambling collection of, how are you enjoying the con?

66
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:08,938
Rym: Get away from me, dude.

67
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,379
Guest: So are you like the friendly drunk or the quiet drunk?

68
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,839
Scott: Rym is the root beer tapper playing drunk.

69
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,004
Rym: That's pretty much it.

70
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:22,900
Rym: I get drunk and eventually I end up at a root beer tapper machine somewhere.

71
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:24,820
Guest: Interesting.

72
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,679
Guest: You should experiment and put yourself in like the middle of the Sahara or something.

73
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,440
Guest: See if you just unearth the root beer tapper machine.

74
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:32,746
Scott: You kidding?

75
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:33,639
Scott: That's what they put all of them.

76
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,159
Scott: That's why there's so few in this country.

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,517
Rym: Have you ever been to the Katsucon?

78
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:40,772
Guest: Me?

79
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:40,979
Guest: No.

80
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,060
Guest: And I really wanted to go because that year that Darryl went, they had Akira Kamiya there.

81
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,740
Guest: And Akira Kamiya is one of my favorite.

82
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:47,440
Guest: He's awesome.

83
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,560
Rym: Actually, if you really want to hang out with him, go to an amazement because he's there almost every year.

84
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:58,240
Rym: And as long as you make friends with the staff, he totally just hangs out with everybody in the back room.

85
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,379
Rym: And then he's awesome.

86
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:00,397
Rym: He's like the best guy ever.

87
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:01,542
Guest: I bet.

88
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:07,520
Guest: And I mean, he spends all his time now, like teaching other voice actors and not not doing enough voice acting himself.

89
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:11,780
Guest: But well, I guess he doesn't need to since like Detective Conan fills that void.

90
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:22,100
Rym: But he did this panel one year I was staff at an amazement where he actually, despite not really speaking English with the audience, he ran a voice acting clinic.

91
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:22,683
Rym: And it was.

92
00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:25,379
Rym: it was crazy how awesome that panel was.

93
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,040
Guest: Yeah, Darryl was telling me that at the panel he went to, he talked about like how he did the voices.

94
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,619
Guest: And he'd talk very specifically about how he positioned his mouth to to like do Kenshiro's voice and things like that.

95
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:46,020
Guest: I guess if you've been doing it for 30 years, you've pretty much got it down, which is unfortunate that he can't do the voice of Kenshiro anymore.

96
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,081
Scott: Yeah.

97
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:53,840
Guest: So, you know, I just I just heard recently that Mari Ijima can't physically sing the songs from Macross anymore.

98
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,660
Scott: Really?

99
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,380
Scott: Because she was she was like going around the country singing like not more than like a year or two ago, right?

100
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,200
Guest: Like, yeah, she was actually just at some concert in Japan.

101
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,760
Guest: It was like Minmay meets like Fire Bomber or something like that.

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,142
Guest: It was like.

103
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:11,720
Scott: it was also like all that Macross anniversary stuff.

104
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,040
Scott: And then, yeah, it was all that she was like New York Comic Con, like one of the not this year, but maybe two or three years ago.

105
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,681
Scott: I forget.

106
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:25,132
Guest: Yeah, I just heard from from a friend of mine, Mike Dent, that she she does can't.

107
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:29,740
Guest: I thought it was a licensing issue, but I guess she can't like physically sing those songs anymore.

108
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:31,257
Guest: Like her voice just can't take it.

109
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,140
Scott: We can get the Hatsune Miku whatever to sing the song.

110
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:43,240
Guest: As far as I'm pretty sure that she probably has, because geeks have got nothing better to do with their time.

111
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,900
Guest: Have you seen that one that one video?

112
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:54,920
Guest: I think that was one of your things of the day where they set like the Mario 2 to like some music and it had it play some music.

113
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:56,104
Rym: Oh, yeah.

114
00:05:56,164 --> 00:06:00,320
Rym: Those perpetual motion slash Rube Goldberg Mario machines.

115
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,202
Guest: Yeah.

116
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:04,919
Guest: And it had just played like the music from the Nico Nico Doga medley.

117
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:06,034
Guest: Yeah.

118
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:06,157
Guest: OK.

119
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,966
Rym: The one I listened to that I really liked, it was.

120
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:13,880
Rym: it was just all I could think when I first listened was, wow, it's Nightwish in Japanese.

121
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:14,819
Rym: This is awesome.

122
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,481
Scott: Yeah.

123
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:19,240
Scott: The best one that I saw was the one that was doing the the Bocorato uninstall.

124
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:20,209
Scott: That was a good one.

125
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,379
Scott: I like that.

126
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:23,400
Guest: Yeah, it was really impressive.

127
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,540
Guest: And from what I understand, it was like a team effort.

128
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,179
Guest: Like they just sent it off and some people did one bit of it.

129
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:32,659
Scott: That's why it was so many separate screens as opposed to just one big long one.

130
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:34,047
Guest: Right.

131
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:34,168
Scott: Right.

132
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:35,200
Scott: All right.

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,160
Scott: So, Gerald, you listen to, I guess, some GeekNights.

134
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,640
Scott: We in so many episodes, you know, we often run out of show ideas and end up making shows like this, which are sort of cop outs.

135
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:50,519
Scott: So can you give us an idea for a GeekNights' episode that you would like to hear?

136
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,825
Guest: A GeekNights' episode, why?

137
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:57,400
Guest: why Black Lion is an awesome show and anyone who dislikes it is stupid.

138
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:57,962
Scott: All right.

139
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:00,699
Scott: So how can we get this Black Lion that I've never heard of?

140
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:02,469
Guest: You can buy it.

141
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:03,620
Guest: It's it's on DVD.

142
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:04,569
Guest: It's just out of print.

143
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:05,560
Rym: Oh, great.

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,103
Rym: I'll get it.

145
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:06,487
Guest: There are many.

146
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,719
Guest: there are many haters of it.

147
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:17,180
Guest: They don't understand that, you know, a show set in the 15th century about that contains time machine cyborgs that spits missiles out of their face, out of their mouth.

148
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:23,240
Guest: And the guy that's gotten his head cut, cut off and been blown up several times can be good.

149
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,167
Guest: It's by going to guy.

150
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:25,438
Scott: So, well, there we go.

151
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:26,715
Guest: Yeah, we go.

152
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:26,979
Guest: Yeah.

153
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:28,444
Scott: All right.

154
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:30,520
Scott: Well, we'll put that on the list somewhere.

155
00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:32,812
Guest: It's forty five minutes long.

156
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:33,760
Guest: That's the entire show.

157
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,224
Scott: Really?

158
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,540
Scott: Oh, maybe then we will do it.

159
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,919
Scott: That's that actually sounds doable.

160
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:37,742
Scott: Yeah.

161
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:43,220
Rym: That's the biggest problem we have now is we want to review a lot more shows because, you know, we kind of split up with comics and all that.

162
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:45,040
Rym: But we don't have time to watch.

163
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,843
Rym: I mean, I'm just now watching Kazuno Yojimbo from like 2002.

164
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:50,918
Rym: Yeah, it's not that good.

165
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:54,038
Guest: Well, that's kind of how we live.

166
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,419
Guest: I mean, I'm getting through what?

167
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:56,820
Guest: Nobody's Boy Remy.

168
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:59,018
Guest: That's from nineteen seventy three.

169
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:06,380
Guest: That is the saddest show I've ever seen in my life directed by Asama Dezaki.

170
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,660
Guest: It's it's so sad.

171
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:11,199
Rym: Have you seen Bocorano all the way through?

172
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:12,820
Guest: No, not all the way through.

173
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,440
Guest: But I have a hard time believing Bocorano can be sadder than this show.

174
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,240
Scott: I haven't I haven't seen enough of either show to make a judgment.

175
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,799
Scott: But remember, what was that show?

176
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,199
Scott: It was like blue boy, blue something.

177
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,060
Scott: Why do we watch it?

178
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,500
Scott: Anime club like freshman year in the science of Romeo's blue sky.

179
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,104
Scott: That's it.

180
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:31,700
Guest: That's I've actually I think I've seen that show.

181
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,620
Scott: Yeah, that's the show where that's a sad show.

182
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,139
Rym: Oh, you're a kid who's poor.

183
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,145
Rym: Oh, don't worry.

184
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,859
Rym: Your dad's going to pull through and make it.

185
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,359
Rym: Oh, no, your dad's got cancer and your house burned down.

186
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:42,684
Guest: Oh, it's.

187
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:44,440
Guest: it's like that every episode.

188
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,060
Guest: It's like, oh, you're such a happy kid.

189
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:47,619
Guest: Oh, you're you're so poor.

190
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,040
Guest: Oh, you're you're you're a cow.

191
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,774
Guest: That's the only thing that's good to you in the world.

192
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:52,500
Guest: was was sold.

193
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,698
Guest: Oh, now you are sold.

194
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,100
Guest: You have to act like an idiot in front of people.

195
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,500
Guest: Oh, your best friends die.

196
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:01,100
Guest: Oh, a meteorite hit your house.

197
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,460
Guest: So there's horrible things constantly happening.

198
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,495
Rym: Of course, then there's the now and then here and there, which is all.

199
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:11,160
Rym: that show was particularly brutal because it started out like a fantasy rock.

200
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,559
Rym: In the next episode, dead cat and rape all around.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,232
Guest: Hilarious.

202
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:20,860
Guest: Laugh a minute.

203
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:31,976
Scott: OK, so something other than basically what I'm going to ask is I want you to give me a suggestion on how to make it better.

204
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,125
Scott: But I think you're just.

205
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:35,780
Scott: I don't want you to say do an episode about black lines.

206
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,636
Scott: You have to see something else.

207
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:38,524
Guest: Hmm.

208
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:41,980
Guest: So are you talking about like any particular day?

209
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:42,785
Scott: No, no, no.

210
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:44,520
Scott: Just like, you know, it could be anything.

211
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,060
Scott: Just something that we can change about GeekNights.

212
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:49,040
Scott: that would improve the show in some way.

213
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,460
Guest: I think if you if you played every episode like Dolomite, then that would be awesome.

214
00:09:55,921 --> 00:10:00,540
Guest: Were you saying the entire episode in rhymes that you would have people listening?

215
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:01,880
Guest: That would be pretty awesome.

216
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,959
Scott: I think that might take too much preparation, but maybe we could be one episode like that.

217
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:09,840
Rym: You should you realize that hesitation rhymes just fine.

218
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,479
Rym: And then you totally missed your chance.

219
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:14,896
Scott: I know.

220
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:15,680
Scott: What do you want?

221
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:16,680
Scott: I'm I'm hungry.

222
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,620
Rym: All right, Scott, do you have any questions that aren't so blah, blah, blah GeekNights?

223
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:22,442
Scott: I know.

224
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,226
Scott: I know those are.

225
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:26,380
Scott: it's just I sort of stack the top of the questions that way.

226
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,520
Scott: And I'm I'm still reworking on these.

227
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:28,822
Scott: All right.

228
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:30,095
Scott: There's only the second one of these we've done.

229
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:30,539
Scott: Give me a break.

230
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:32,062
Scott: All right.

231
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:35,359
Scott: So, Gerald, you're obviously primarily the anime geek.

232
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,759
Scott: But do you have any other geekries besides that?

233
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,719
Guest: I do like video games a lot.

234
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:51,000
Guest: I'm actually was playing through Metal Gear Solid three subsistence because Metal Gear Solid four is coming out and I kind of want to be up on that.

235
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:59,900
Guest: I like I'm a really big fan of like 90s adventure games like PC games, like the LucasArts stuff.

236
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:02,019
Rym: Oh, man, that's for glory.

237
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,218
Rym: You ever play Quest for Glory?

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,698
Guest: Quest for Glory now.

239
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,159
Rym: Oh, that's the best one.

240
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:06,905
Scott: It says the way.

241
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:10,619
Scott: if you would have said yes or you would have we would have just been able to kill 10 minutes of you talking about it.

242
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:19,240
Guest: But stuff like Graham Fandango and Dave, the tentacle and Sam and Max and those point and click ones, I'm a I'm a huge fan of those.

243
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,064
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

244
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:24,999
Scott: I really like the stories and the plots and a lot of those games and the animation and everything, you know.

245
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,302
Scott: But I found that when I try to play them now, like I loaded up the scum V.M.

246
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,999
Scott: a little while ago and I tried to play like full throttle and some of the other ones.

247
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:39,160
Scott: And if you use a fact, basically you just burn right through the game and you see the you know, the story and then it's over.

248
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:49,960
Scott: If you don't use a fact, it's just really frustrating because it turns into a game of click on absolutely everything and absolutely every combination until you move forward or, you know, pay attention.

249
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:50,743
Rym: Yes.

250
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:51,579
Rym: Solve the play.

251
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,179
Scott: Sometimes it makes sense, but sometimes it just doesn't.

252
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,759
Guest: Sometimes it really depends on the logic of the world.

253
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:03,340
Guest: Like there are some point and click adventures where the answers are logical and some of them are just crazy.

254
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,060
Guest: Like if did you guys ever play any of the Legend of Kaelandria series?

255
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,178
Scott: I've never heard of that.

256
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,871
Guest: A Corandia?

257
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:10,599
Scott: Oh, actually, no.

258
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,939
Scott: Yeah, I might have heard of that.

259
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:13,320
Scott: I think I saw the name somewhere.

260
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,752
Guest: Yeah, it came out in the early 90s and it was by Westwood.

261
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:26,740
Guest: And they were like the epitome of if you do not collect these items and go to this area, then you will die and you will have to reset your entire game.

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,498
Scott: So Shadowgate.

263
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,521
Guest: Yeah.

264
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:34,380
Guest: And like one of the one of the problems that came up was like you had to sneak into this bathroom or something like that.

265
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:34,922
Guest: I forgot.

266
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,159
Guest: And you had to fool the guy who was guarding it.

267
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:39,398
Guest: And the way to fool him.

268
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:52,218
Guest: And if this makes sense to you, like if you would figure this out through the game's logic, you had to find a squirrel, hypnotize the squirrel and wear it on your head as a hat before you could sneak in.

269
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:54,166
Scott: So wait.

270
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:55,880
Scott: So these this is Westwood, right?

271
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,560
Scott: So those are the same people that made Command and Conquer.

272
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:02,080
Scott: And I believe, didn't they also make like the Blade Runner game?

273
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:02,842
Guest: Yep.

274
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:03,538
Guest: That one, too.

275
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,200
Rym: That game was actually really good.

276
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,625
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:06,920
Scott: Didn't they?

278
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:09,240
Scott: I think they made the Planescape torment game, you know, maybe.

279
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:11,059
Guest: I don't think so.

280
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,435
Scott: I don't remember, but I think there was an advertisement for it in one on one of the CD-ROMs for like Red Alert.

281
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:16,000
Scott: I don't remember.

282
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:16,907
Guest: Yeah.

283
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:17,295
Guest: Yeah.

284
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:18,123
Guest: Yeah.

285
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:19,200
Guest: Some of them were just out there.

286
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:25,960
Guest: Like even today, there's the the the touch detective on on Nintendo DS is like that.

287
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,664
Scott: No, really?

288
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:29,039
Scott: Because I was I was thinking about getting that when it was like 10 bucks.

289
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,019
Guest: It's a really great game and I really like the style in it.

290
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,579
Guest: But you can't get through the game without a fact, because like, again, one of the puzzles is you have to get into this room.

291
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:42,860
Guest: And in order to get into this room, you have to make the landlady have memories of her youth.

292
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:45,159
Guest: How do you have her have memories of her youth?

293
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,080
Guest: By finding a bicycle pump and pumping her up so she floats away.

294
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:55,860
Rym: See, you got to go with the deja vu strategy where you knock her out and pump her full of methadone.

295
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:56,201
Rym: Yeah.

296
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:56,563
Scott: Yeah.

297
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:57,688
Scott: Deja vu was actually.

298
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,280
Scott: that was a game that I was able to beat on logic alone.

299
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,796
Scott: I mean, it took me a while as a kid, but I was a little.

300
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:06,598
Rym: there's one problem with logic in that game, because I remember the first time I beat it.

301
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:11,700
Scott: Right before you go to the police station at the end, give absolutely everything you can to the evil alligator in the sewer.

302
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:13,165
Rym: No, no.

303
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:15,280
Rym: My problem was I had everything I needed.

304
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,250
Rym: I went to the bungalow.

305
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:17,020
Rym: I got it all.

306
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:18,580
Rym: I, of course, saved my game.

307
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,159
Scott: You didn't have enough money to pay for the taxi.

308
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,602
Rym: I had.

309
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:20,863
Rym: no.

310
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,760
Rym: I had two twenty dollar bills, but not enough quarters.

311
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,280
Rym: And the cabbie wouldn't take a twenty.

312
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:26,573
Rym: And that was the end.

313
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:26,654
Scott: Yep.

314
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,221
Guest: Yeah.

315
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,700
Guest: At least they're not like the any of those games done by Roberta Williams.

316
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,800
Guest: Those are just brutal.

317
00:14:35,522 --> 00:14:37,880
Scott: No, I'm playing the new penny arcade one.

318
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:38,404
Scott: I play.

319
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,656
Scott: I played it for like five, 10 minutes.

320
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:41,358
Scott: Well, we'll see how it goes.

321
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:44,379
Guest: So it was only worth playing for five or 10 minutes.

322
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,840
Scott: Well, no, it's all I've had the time to play it so far.

323
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:47,343
Scott: Oh, OK.

324
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:57,520
Scott: My my first impression of five, 10 minutes is that, you know, the theme of the game is absolutely amazing because it's all penny arcaded and the gameplay is average, not really exciting or revolutionary.

325
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,780
Rym: It's better than that card game.

326
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:07,986
Scott: You know, it's like click on a box, get an item, you know, turn based, fight the little fruit fucker, you know, Final Fantasy, you know, fighting combat, whatever.

327
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:16,719
Guest: The very few impressions that I've heard of it give me the idea that if you do not if you are not a penny arcade devotee, then most of the humor will be over your head.

328
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,259
Scott: That probably makes sense.

329
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,366
Scott: That makes a lot of sense.

330
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:20,313
Guest: Yeah.

331
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:21,260
Scott: All right.

332
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,319
Rym: So well, speaking of penny arcade, you read any webcomics?

333
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,100
Guest: No, actually, I don't.

334
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,780
Guest: I've actually had a hard time getting into webcomics because I read.

335
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,780
Guest: I tried to read a couple like way, way, way back when.

336
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:33,999
Rym: Oh, and they were all awful.

337
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:35,204
Guest: Yeah.

338
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:36,820
Guest: And I think that that probably scared me away.

339
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:42,419
Guest: And then then people have like said, oh, you should check this out or you should check that out.

340
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:51,718
Guest: And I guess with webcomics, they being a webcomic, you can be very, very focused on what sort of humor you want and what sort of audience you want to to read you.

341
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,179
Guest: And invariably, I'm not that audience.

342
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,280
Guest: And like, I like XKCD some of the time.

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,780
Rym: I love that comic.

344
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:02,224
Scott: I don't know.

345
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:03,936
Scott: I get the feeling, Gerald, to be a Dr.

346
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,004
Scott: McNinja fan.

347
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:06,760
Rym: I think you'd be a Perry Bible Fellowship fan.

348
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:07,620
Scott: Oh, yeah, definitely.

349
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,419
Guest: Yeah, I read a bunch of that.

350
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,680
Guest: Like that's one that I heard about and I read a few.

351
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,719
Guest: And again, that was kind of hit and miss for me.

352
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,858
Guest: And I guess that that's kind of the best you can say about any webcomic.

353
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:24,980
Rym: Well, if you're if you seem to enjoy, I mean, now and then here and there is a laugh riot and the parking lot is full is probably right up your alley.

354
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:28,751
Rym: Oh, boy.

355
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:31,240
Rym: That's goofy time is all I got to say about that.

356
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,159
Scott: Don't don't keep talking about that stuff.

357
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,325
Guest: It's no good.

358
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:36,820
Rym: Or I'm surprised I never read like the Thin H line.

359
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,280
Guest: I did read to the Thin H line way back when, like when I had a really old dial up modem.

360
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:43,217
Rym: Yeah, I remember.

361
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,600
Rym: I love that comic, but at the same time, I look back at it and I'm not sure if I actually find it funny.

362
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,119
Guest: Well, I just remember that it had like five different jokes or so.

363
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:59,320
Guest: And once it had gotten through all those jokes, basically just had to recycle those jokes.

364
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:02,379
Guest: I'm not actually certain if it's it's still going today.

365
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:04,339
Rym: I don't think so.

366
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,400
Scott: No, it ended when we were in college still.

367
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,680
Scott: And then he went out to do something else and then he think he quit.

368
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,002
Scott: Right.

369
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:10,019
Scott: I don't remember.

370
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,599
Guest: Yeah, that was really popular for a while.

371
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:14,540
Scott: Well, you read the manga, right?

372
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:18,660
Scott: But do you read any non manga comics that are printed?

373
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,919
Guest: Non manga comics that are printed?

374
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:22,460
Guest: No, not really.

375
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,400
Guest: And that's not like meant to be a stub towards American comics at all.

376
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,440
Guest: It's just more like I've got piles and piles of unread manga here.

377
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:34,260
Guest: I don't need to add piles and piles of unread American comics.

378
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:35,023
Scott: Yeah, I've got.

379
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:36,632
Scott: I got piles and piles of unread both.

380
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:37,215
Scott: So.

381
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:37,798
Scott: Yeah.

382
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:42,680
Guest: It's kind of like how people were saying to me, you know, you should get onto World of Warcraft.

383
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,616
Guest: You should play that with us.

384
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:49,018
Guest: And I've got a bunch of unopened games here.

385
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:49,420
Guest: Tons.

386
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,826
Guest: Like I got.

387
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:52,440
Guest: I just buy them when they're really, really cheap.

388
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,600
Guest: So I've got enough games.

389
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,900
Guest: If I never bought another game, I'd probably be set for years.

390
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,024
Rym: I know that.

391
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,600
Rym: I mean, I bought Bioshock like right when it came out.

392
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:03,373
Rym: I played up until that doctor.

393
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:04,239
Rym: I killed him.

394
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:07,140
Rym: And to this day, I have not played beyond that point.

395
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,603
Rym: I've got.

396
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,053
Scott: I got Bioshock right now.

397
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:09,920
Scott: I've got let's see.

398
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:11,431
Scott: I still didn't be.

399
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:12,620
Scott: I got Okami for the Wii.

400
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,300
Rym: You haven't even turned that on.

401
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,520
Scott: I never actually beat Super Paper Mario.

402
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,246
Scott: I didn't.

403
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,620
Scott: I'm still working on Mario Kart.

404
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,620
Scott: I got the Rondo of Swords.

405
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:26,436
Scott: I didn't actually beat Mario Soccer ever.

406
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:27,040
Scott: Right.

407
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,041
Scott: OK.

408
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:29,432
Guest: That game or is it more like?

409
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:30,360
Scott: you can get all you can like.

410
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,019
Scott: do all the single player like tournament cup.

411
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:33,119
Scott: You can win all the cups.

412
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:34,443
Scott: OK.

413
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:37,080
Rym: Scott tends to unlock everything for me in multiplayer games.

414
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,360
Rym: And I just play the multiplayer.

415
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:39,306
Rym: All right.

416
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:41,300
Scott: I got Civ IV, which I just bought.

417
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,640
Scott: I got the Bioshock.

418
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,700
Rym: I got that already.

419
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,643
Rym: I think you're right.

420
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:50,000
Scott: Oh, I got Bioshock, Everyday Shooter and the Penny Arcade game.

421
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:50,783
Guest: Yeah.

422
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:53,320
Scott: So none of those games I've beaten.

423
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,320
Scott: I have them all sitting there.

424
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,020
Rym: Plus, where do you watch the most recent Yahtzee?

425
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,418
Rym: You got to buy Painkiller now, too.

426
00:18:57,741 --> 00:18:58,407
Scott: I probably do.

427
00:18:58,548 --> 00:18:59,760
Scott: Actually, it's I read someone.

428
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,020
Scott: I read a review of Yahtzee's review and it sounded like a game.

429
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,376
Scott: I want to sound like a game I might be interested in.

430
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:06,504
Guest: Yeah.

431
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,980
Guest: And so I don't really need to get World of Warcraft.

432
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,700
Guest: That's fifteen dollars a month that will fill up my life.

433
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:13,599
Guest: And I will never talk to anybody ever again.

434
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,540
Scott: Well, you'll talk to the World of Warcraft.

435
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,859
Rym: You'll make friends in the game.

436
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,740
Guest: But World of Warcraft people are the most vile people in the world.

437
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,280
Rym: General, I could kiss you right now because this is listeners that love that action.

438
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,520
Rym: This has always been a we always get into arguments in our forums about World of Warcraft.

439
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:39,479
Rym: And my feelings are just that I've better things to do with my life, implying that you also have better things to do with your life.

440
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:47,259
Guest: And well, I pretend that I've got better things to do with my life, but I just I just tend to do them alone rather than with other shitty people.

441
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:50,084
Rym: I don't know.

442
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:55,380
Rym: I think I think people like us could enjoy a game like, wow, a lot more if it was more skill based and less.

443
00:19:55,781 --> 00:20:01,180
Rym: How much time do you spend in front of it to get the mad loot with a one point four eight nine percent drop rate?

444
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,779
Guest: Yeah, I don't know.

445
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,940
Guest: I mean, it might be a perfectly nice, perfectly good game.

446
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Guest: And I've heard from people that, you know, it's still a fun game to play.

447
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:14,980
Guest: But it just seems like I don't really want to get involved in that because everybody I know who plays it is insane.

448
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:18,260
Guest: And they spend every night doing only that.

449
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:20,699
Guest: And I never see them and I never talk with them.

450
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:22,478
Guest: And I don't want to be like that.

451
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:25,440
Guest: I'm I'm perfectly fine doing my things.

452
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:27,220
Guest: And I've got enough anime to watch.

453
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,220
Guest: I don't need I don't need a World of Warcraft to be taking up any more time.

454
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:33,300
Rym: Got anime, just like unfinished games.

455
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,240
Rym: There's enough anime that I haven't seen to where they could never make an anime again.

456
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,020
Rym: And I'd still have stuff to watch for the rest of my life.

457
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,377
Scott: As long as you get your hands on it.

458
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,421
Guest: Yeah.

459
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:42,063
Guest: Yeah.

460
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,198
Guest: Well, I tend to go wild when there are sales on.

461
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,161
Rym: Yeah.

462
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:49,460
Rym: Whenever I'm at a con and there's the guy with the four or five dollar DVDs.

463
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:54,740
Rym: I have three separate copies of the second or say it's a movie just because I love that movie.

464
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,380
Guest: Yeah, that's a really good one.

465
00:20:56,641 --> 00:21:02,640
Guest: I just ordered all of Gotcha Man, the original Gotcha Man, Battle of the Planets.

466
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,660
Scott: That's the one with the guys with the bird hats, right?

467
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,341
Guest: Yeah.

468
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:09,300
Guest: So they had a. those box sets are kind of tricky to find.

469
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:10,800
Guest: And the show is just awesome.

470
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:22,860
Guest: And it's I'm afraid that that's going to be one of those shows like or Battle of Dunbine that you're just never going to see the end of it because those DVDs, they're only going to produce like 20 DVDs of it later.

471
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,019
Guest: And then they're just going to be gone forever.

472
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:25,733
Scott: Mm hmm.

473
00:21:25,754 --> 00:21:25,856
Scott: Yeah.

474
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:26,100
Scott: All right.

475
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,640
Scott: So anime is obviously your biggest geekery.

476
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,320
Scott: But how did you originally become an anime fan?

477
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,540
Scott: I mean, you weren't born with like, you know, a fan sub hanging out of your mouth.

478
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,519
Guest: Were you close to it?

479
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,900
Guest: Well, it's kind of a long and boring story, but I'll keep it as short as possible.

480
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:45,093
Guest: No, it's actually not long and boring at all.

481
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:46,040
Guest: It's just boring.

482
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:53,660
Guest: The I started watching anime when I was living in South Africa.

483
00:21:54,601 --> 00:22:01,460
Guest: And we had one channel on television that was on for about six hours a day.

484
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,380
Guest: That was ironically called TV one.

485
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,178
Guest: And we that they showed Robotech on there.

486
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:12,980
Guest: And I remember watching that and I was really young.

487
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:19,639
Guest: But I knew that this was just something very different from, you know, Paddington Bear and Scooby Doo and things like that.

488
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:27,420
Guest: And when I came to America, there was a little bit more of it on TV, not a whole lot.

489
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,359
Guest: But we were in the Virgin Islands and in the Virgin Islands, it's impossible to get much anime down there.

490
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,379
Guest: And my roommate is looking at me very weirdly as I'm talking.

491
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:41,648
Scott: Hello, roommate.

492
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:43,020
Scott: We should talk to your roommate.

493
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:45,728
Rym: What's he really like?

494
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,179
Rym: What's he really like?

495
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:49,280
Guest: My roommate is female.

496
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:49,945
Guest: No, no.

497
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:51,120
Scott: That's what we would tell you.

498
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,199
Scott: We would ask your roommate, what is Gerald really like?

499
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,680
Guest: Oh, what am I really like?

500
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,699
Guest: Oh, she's going to say horrible things about me.

501
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,977
Scott: Yes, that's the idea.

502
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,868
Guest: She's laughing.

503
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:00,659
Guest: She's agreeing with that.

504
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:01,699
Scott: All right.

505
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,419
Guest: She said Gerald's a faggot.

506
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:04,659
Guest: I disagree with that.

507
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:08,000
Scott: So the Virgin Islands, where Gerald's from?

508
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,581
Guest: Yeah.

509
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:22,279
Guest: Then basically every time we'd make a trip to Puerto Rico or to Florida, I would generally get to the comic book stores, because that's the only place you could find anime.

510
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,908
Guest: And I think around 1988 or '89, I found a copy of Akira in a comic book store.

511
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,819
Guest: It was like 40 bucks.

512
00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:31,900
Guest: Wow, that's a lot.

513
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,960
Guest: Video comics edition.

514
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:33,980
Scott: Is it the subtitled one?

515
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:37,080
Guest: No, that subtitled version came much later.

516
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:37,699
Scott: Oh, really?

517
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,742
Guest: Yeah.

518
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:43,772
Guest: It was the special subtitled edition that I think was like widescreen, but it wasn't actually widescreen.

519
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:44,400
Guest: It was cropped.

520
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:48,300
Scott: Yeah, that was the one that the anime club had a VHS of.

521
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,638
Scott: It came in like a little white box.

522
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,537
Guest: Yeah, yeah.

523
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:51,118
Scott: Yeah, that one.

524
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,900
Guest: Yeah, this was the old video comics one.

525
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,000
Guest: And I remember watching this and it seemed like pretty hard for a while.

526
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,840
Guest: And then suddenly like there's the guy walking through the cars and then the dog runs at him and then he pulls out the gun and shoots the dog right in the head.

527
00:24:03,462 --> 00:24:05,380
Guest: Like, wow, this is pretty rough.

528
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,657
Guest: And then the other dog jumps at him and then he shoots it and it splats against the car.

529
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:13,660
Guest: And there's the kid inside the car and there's this dead dog guts all over the car.

530
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:15,499
Guest: Like, wow, this is interesting.

531
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:20,840
Rym: And that's how I felt, you know, vampire 100D when I was in fourth grade.

532
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:25,180
Scott: No, it's funny because actually I haven't seen a care in a long time.

533
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,763
Scott: And I actually sort of I needed to buy something on Amazon to get an order to have free shipping.

534
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:35,059
Scott: So I'm like, oh, I'll get the Akira DVD, you know, the the the pioneer genie on one, because I didn't have it.

535
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:36,312
Scott: So I said, all right, I'll get it.

536
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:36,999
Scott: I should own that.

537
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:40,360
Scott: So I just showed up recently and I was like, oh, I remember this.

538
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,025
Scott: Oh, yeah.

539
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,380
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's good.

540
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,460
Guest: Yeah, I really I really miss that dub, though.

541
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,240
Guest: The the old Cam Clark Streamline Pictures dub, which I miss some of it.

542
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,546
Rym: Do you think it's really?

543
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:53,220
Rym: I mean, is it good or is it just pure nostalgia?

544
00:24:54,221 --> 00:25:00,560
Guest: I think that it has its moments that are certainly memorable because I can't like things ironically.

545
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:02,775
Guest: I either like them or I don't.

546
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:07,760
Guest: There's no distinction for me if it's like an ironic love or any other sort of love.

547
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:14,522
Guest: But I mean, the one like the Colonel was played by the guy that did Macruff, the crime dog.

548
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:19,099
Guest: And there are points in that dub where he growls and you can hear it.

549
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:22,839
Guest: The I do like it a whole lot.

550
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:24,985
Guest: Actually, what?

551
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:28,684
Guest: And I don't think Akira wasn't the first anime that I owned, though.

552
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:29,499
Guest: I think I might have owned.

553
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:30,964
Guest: No, no, no.

554
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:38,820
Guest: I couldn't have owned much before that, because I think the other anime after that was like Project Aco and Gal Force and things like that.

555
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,560
Rym: Now, now, were you one of those people?

556
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,433
Rym: I don't know if you've said this.

557
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:42,880
Rym: I forget.

558
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:48,908
Rym: And I had my world order because I forget where a lot of people seem to watch Project Aco as kids and they didn't get that.

559
00:25:48,928 --> 00:25:52,801
Rym: it was a joke and they see because I actually had.

560
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:56,280
Rym: it was serious business and what's going on and where'd you get those powers?

561
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,142
Rym: Oh, my God.

562
00:25:57,965 --> 00:26:08,507
Guest: I actually we actually had this discussion and I'm in the group that that I watched it and I saw it as a comedy because, you know, the faces weren't all crazy and such.

563
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,460
Guest: And to me, that was a sign of a comedy.

564
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,459
Guest: And Darryl was in the in the group of that.

565
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,300
Guest: This was, you know, an action movie with some comedic moments.

566
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:19,960
Guest: So and I don't really know disparage people either way.

567
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:22,000
Guest: I just want them to watch Project Aco.

568
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:31,340
Guest: So, yeah, I was actually thought I actually thought it was a comedy like I don't know that the big Mari, the like Kenshiro.

569
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:33,519
Rym: I love her voice in the dubs.

570
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:45,100
Guest: Yeah, well, but they did actually get two different people for both the dub and the subversion unless they just like cut the sub like screaming in the sub into the dub.

571
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,340
Guest: That dub was really good, though.

572
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,865
Guest: That was I thought it was actually one of those dubs that was done in London, but it wasn't.

573
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,640
Guest: It was actually done by just off Broadway actors.

574
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:55,520
Guest: But I really love that old dub a lot.

575
00:26:57,143 --> 00:27:08,260
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I there was a period I think it was a few months back where I went around like listening to like audio clips from, you know, old dubs that I thought I liked or or did like and just listening to them.

576
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:15,500
Scott: I sort of had it was it was very weird because on the one hand, my modern sensibility of, oh, that dub is terrible, hit me on one side.

577
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,800
Scott: But then the other half of my brain was like, oh, the nostalgia, it's so great.

578
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,549
Scott: Don't you remember this?

579
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,178
Scott: And I'm like, no.

580
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,260
Scott: And it was it really tore me in half.

581
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:32,600
Rym: Kind of I think those old dubs had in some ways a lot more heart than a lot of modern dubs, even if that's just a product of less professional development.

582
00:27:33,981 --> 00:27:42,046
Guest: Yeah, well, I kind of see it sort of like that, maybe like the dubs today are technically very well done.

583
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,560
Guest: There's no no comparison to those old dubs.

584
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,360
Guest: And but I don't know.

585
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,420
Guest: It seems like they're having a lot less fun doing the dubs.

586
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:50,881
Guest: I don't know.

587
00:27:50,901 --> 00:28:04,081
Guest: I really can't tell because like I was I was comparing the the ADV dub of Project not of Project Eden, the Dirty Pair movie to the streamlined dub of Project Eden.

588
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,120
Guest: And the streamlined dub of Project Eden is a terrific, terrific dub.

589
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,350
Guest: It's got a lot of heart.

590
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,379
Guest: It's got a lot of jokes in it.

591
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,780
Guest: And they rewrote some lines, but they still maintained like the flavor of the show.

592
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:20,756
Guest: And the ADV dub technically was better, but just came off as sort of.

593
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:23,620
Guest: we're doing this because we have to do it and get our paycheck.

594
00:28:24,422 --> 00:28:29,003
Scott: Yeah, I think they just back then, you know, I guess they just took it a lot less seriously.

595
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:32,620
Scott: You know, it's like, yeah, we're just making a dub of an anime, whatever.

596
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,500
Scott: But now they're like, oh, it's a serious business.

597
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:35,606
Scott: We got to do this right.

598
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:36,149
Scott: Well,

599
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:50,499
Rym: especially you meet a lot of the American voice actors at conventions and they I don't want to disparage any of them that I may or may not have met over the years, but they seem like they take themselves a lot more seriously than even the professional original Japanese voice actors do.

600
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:54,840
Scott: And some of them, I mean, it really depends on who you're talking about.

601
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,121
Rym: Yeah.

602
00:28:55,623 --> 00:29:04,340
Rym: I mean, I mean, yeah, like Lisa Ortiz was just awesome and cool, but obviously I'm not naming names of the ones who are a little for obvious reasons.

603
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:04,863
Rym: Yeah.

604
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:06,699
Guest: Oh, we'll we'll say the names of them.

605
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:15,940
Guest: But like we've only met like I've only met Vic Mignogna very briefly and he was very pleasant, like went up, shook my hand and just said, oh, that's cool.

606
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,400
Guest: You've got a podcast or whatever.

607
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:24,860
Guest: It was a brief meeting, so I can't really say anything about him because he's the one that stands out because he's got like fan club and everything.

608
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:33,519
Guest: So but I mean, I guess I can't think of any that I've met that have really gotten on my nerves or anything.

609
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:52,021
Guest: The one thing that does annoy me and this isn't necessarily like a dub voice actor thing, but it's when you get you when you get these these people that work on the American editions and then they talk about how, well, I was working on the show and I wrote the episodes for this show and then I wrote the episodes for this show.

610
00:29:52,623 --> 00:30:07,244
Guest: And when they didn't write these episodes, really, they they adapted them from the Japanese script because there's a different level of writing when you're writing something that from scratch and then when you're just adapting something.

611
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:14,139
Guest: And when they say, you know, I'm on the same level as the guy that just wrote this from scratch, that kind of annoys me a little bit.

612
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:27,820
Scott: Yeah, it seems like I've noticed that a lot is that you'll see in manga or anime that they'll credit someone as a writer, you know, even though, you know, they really like an adapter or, you know, just sort of a translator.

613
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,431
Scott: You know, it's like they didn't even translate it.

614
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,499
Scott: Someone else translated it.

615
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:39,260
Scott: And then they just sort of took the raw translation, converted it to something, you know, intelligible instead of just, you know, a bunch of translation notes.

616
00:30:39,783 --> 00:30:44,065
Guest: And it's certainly not to disparage that because there is an art to adaptation and translation, but it's just.

617
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:46,800
Guest: it's not like writing a show from scratch.

618
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,267
Scott: Yeah, yeah, it's definitely.

619
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:51,960
Scott: it's not something like, oh, that's a bad job or it requires no talent or it sucks.

620
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,780
Scott: It's that, you know, should it be called writer is the question.

621
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,900
Scott: Should it be called something else instead of writer?

622
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:58,444
Scott: And that's sort of like.

623
00:30:58,464 --> 00:31:04,580
Scott: I had a similar argument recently with some comic book nerds because they were like, oh, who's the best writers of all time in comic books?

624
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,680
Scott: And they were all like, Stan Lee, Stan Lee.

625
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:18,997
Scott: And I'm like, look, Stanley, he came up with some ideas that happen to be successful, but the man can't write for a hill of beans, you know, I mean, alliteration, spelling errors, grammar errors, you know, it's

626
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:19,720
Guest: a bold face,

627
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:27,391
Scott: random boldface text, a guy, a picture of a guy punching a guy and the guy who's throwing the punch says, I punch you,

628
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:28,619
Rym: you little guy.

629
00:31:28,941 --> 00:31:29,305
Scott: Yeah.

630
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:30,940
Scott: And like, it's not good writing.

631
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,179
Guest: I don't, you know, so so so you don't have much hope for Ultimo, I guess.

632
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:46,120
Rym: You know, I think I said this in our coverage of the Comic-Con, but all the promotional material that we received or that we saw was not Ultimo by Stan Lee.

633
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,839
Rym: It was Stan Lee's Ultimo.

634
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:50,606
Guest: Hmm.

635
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:51,840
Guest: So so they know what they're pushing there.

636
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,278
Rym: Oh, they definitely do.

637
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:54,783
Rym: Yeah.

638
00:31:54,823 --> 00:31:55,486
Rym: And Stan Lee is.

639
00:31:55,768 --> 00:31:57,214
Guest: Stan Lee has been big into like.

640
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:59,264
Guest: he's known about manga for a long, long time.

641
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:02,179
Guest: There's actually like photographs of him meeting with Osamu Tezuka and such.

642
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:02,461
Guest: Yeah.

643
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:04,279
Scott: I mean, the guy is a smart guy.

644
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:05,519
Scott: He's a friendly guy.

645
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,460
Scott: He's he's really good at business.

646
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:14,300
Scott: He's really good at lots and lots of things, but he's not good at writing, according to my definition of writing.

647
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:24,339
Scott: I mean, he can come up with ideas for characters or, you know, depending on how much of the characters he came up with, you know, versus how much the other guys who worked at Marvel came up with them.

648
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:32,100
Scott: You know, you're not going to have that argument, but, you know, there's a lot of things about Stan Lee that are that are positive, but he cannot write for shit.

649
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:39,120
Guest: Yeah, I haven't read enough of his work to actually make a decision on that.

650
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,194
Guest: But did you guys happen to see this?

651
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:43,660
Guest: Are we running long on time?

652
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:44,388
Scott: Oh, whatever.

653
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:44,855
Scott: Don't worry about it.

654
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:55,635
Guest: There was this very interesting like article up on the Star Wars website and it was comparing the Star Wars manga that came out in the 1970s.

655
00:32:56,963 --> 00:32:57,859
Scott: Oh, I've seen that one.

656
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,760
Guest: To the Star Wars American comic book that came out at the same time.

657
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:05,060
Guest: It was absolutely fascinating.

658
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:12,259
Guest: And this is again, I don't mean to disparage American comic books because American comic books do things very well that the Japanese could learn from.

659
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:26,519
Guest: But they specifically talked about that one because there were so many things that the manga did very well that the the American comic book didn't didn't really get across, like the the destruction of Alderaan.

660
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,139
Guest: I guess you guys don't.

661
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,055
Rym: Spoilers.

662
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:35,119
Guest: I have the feeling everyone listening to the show knows what that's about.

663
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:43,219
Guest: Like in the American comic book, it was just one panel and it was just one panel of just Alderaan exploding and that's it.

664
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:58,160
Guest: In the Japanese comic book, it was six pages of just the death star firing up and then shooting and then hitting the planet and then the planet like rumbling and then exploding and then a shot of Leia's eye and a tear running down her face.

665
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,562
Guest: And it was.

666
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:02,240
Guest: it was a very sort of decompressed way of telling the story.

667
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,803
Guest: And it was.

668
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:13,199
Guest: it's fascinating to see it because you just see like like some of the rough things that like the American comic book writers had to deal with them.

669
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:24,380
Guest: Like every single panel almost had a had a narration block of text describing what was going on, like the picture wasn't enough.

670
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,679
Guest: They had to describe it as well.

671
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,518
Rym: I punch you, you little guy.

672
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:31,259
Rym: He punched the little guy and then a picture of a guy punching a little guy.

673
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:31,841
Guest: Yep.

674
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:32,266
Guest: Yep.

675
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:33,319
Scott: That's it.

676
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:35,480
Guest: I was absolutely fascinating.

677
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,320
Rym: Let's get a little bit away from the kind of traditional geekery nerderies.

678
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,520
Rym: So you're a podcaster.

679
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,641
Guest: Why?

680
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:46,440
Guest: Because we have nothing else better to do with our times.

681
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:47,545
Guest: No, no.

682
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:48,657
Guest: Oh, God, I don't know.

683
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:52,860
Rym: I mean, because it seems like podcasting like had a mini explosion.

684
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,440
Rym: It didn't pick up like webcomics did, but it was like Puff.

685
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:56,560
Rym: And there's a lot of podcasts.

686
00:34:57,201 --> 00:35:02,647
Rym: And then a lot of those podcasts disappeared or faded as they called it or whatever.

687
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,159
Rym: I don't know if we need a word for that.

688
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,879
Rym: That word's always kind of bothered me.

689
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:07,260
Guest: It's pretty much gone.

690
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,980
Guest: Yeah, I think we started doing anime world order because we were listening.

691
00:35:15,022 --> 00:35:17,540
Guest: Well, actually, it was all Clarissa's idea, actually.

692
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:26,180
Guest: Like Clarissa should take all the credit for it because she was the one who started it up and she was and it was actually like an extra credit project for her.

693
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:32,024
Guest: And then what we wanted to do was honestly, really, honestly, we want people to watch good anime.

694
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:36,400
Guest: And we we just really like talking about anime a lot.

695
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,659
Guest: And we were listening to a lot of the anime podcasts at the time.

696
00:35:41,442 --> 00:35:43,334
Guest: And some of them were OK.

697
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,424
Guest: Like we were listening to the Ninja Consultants and we thought they were really good.

698
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:54,800
Guest: Nobody really addressed the things that we wanted to talk about.

699
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,580
Guest: Like nobody was talking about virtually anything older than the Naruto.

700
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,400
Guest: And so we thought maybe we can do something that focuses on old school stuff.

701
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:10,261
Guest: And there were a lot of podcasts that were reviewing like one or two episodes of a show.

702
00:36:10,944 --> 00:36:22,926
Guest: And we thought, well, you know, one or two episodes doesn't really give you a good impression of the show because the show can shift halfway through or the show can start to suck after a few episodes, because that was when Gonzo was coming out with all their stuff.

703
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:23,349
Scott: Yeah, great.

704
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,600
Guest: Like one or two first episodes or first five episodes.

705
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,746
Scott: Of course, who are we to talk?

706
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,860
Scott: We pretty much review single episodes all the time.

707
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:36,202
Rym: No, but we make it very clear that they were like, we're reviewing the first episode of this.

708
00:36:36,302 --> 00:36:36,928
Rym: Blah, blah, blah.

709
00:36:36,948 --> 00:36:38,400
Rym: Don't take this as a blah, blah, blah.

710
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:39,208
Scott: Yeah.

711
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:40,040
Guest: Yeah.

712
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:46,024
Guest: And so we just decided to start our own because, well, we just really wanted people to check out good stuff.

713
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:58,800
Guest: And we every single podcast out there that we were looking at, another one, another reason was because all of them out there were the anime and video game slash Halo slash lifestyle podcast.

714
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:02,340
Guest: And we wanted it just to be about anime only.

715
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:06,722
Guest: In fact, we've gone back and forth saying maybe we can do, you know, a video game episode.

716
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:09,020
Guest: No, we're going to do just anime and manga.

717
00:37:09,202 --> 00:37:09,566
Guest: That's it.

718
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:10,699
Guest: We're just going to stick to that.

719
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,519
Guest: And because that's what we know best.

720
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:15,060
Rym: Yeah, I think it's worked really well for you guys.

721
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:23,721
Rym: I mean, I feel like even if you ever wanted to do like a video game special, it should be this separate thing like anime world order presents or I don't know what you could call it.

722
00:37:23,962 --> 00:37:28,342
Scott: And maybe if you did it, you'd have to do it on like anime related video games or something like that.

723
00:37:28,764 --> 00:37:43,045
Rym: Or if you want to totally get away with that and cop out, you guys could appear on gig nights as guest hosts for, say, a Tuesday, because we're going to three conventions in August and we need and then we're going out of town for a week in the middle of all that.

724
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:45,539
Rym: So we kind of we need some guest hosts.

725
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:46,804
Guest: I see.

726
00:37:46,824 --> 00:37:51,002
Guest: Oh, speaking of anime video games, have you guys heard about the the new Capcom game?

727
00:37:51,425 --> 00:37:53,720
Scott: Which one, DC versus Mortal Kombat?

728
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:55,767
Guest: That's going to suck.

729
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:56,452
Guest: That's not Capcom.

730
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,240
Scott: Capcom does the Marvel and the Capcom.

731
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:10,500
Guest: They do the versus games and they're coming out with it's Capcom like Ryu, Chun-Li, Street Fighter, Mega Man, all that versus Tatsunoko.

732
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:16,260
Guest: So Gotcha Man, Cushurn, Captain Tyler is part of it as well.

733
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:18,559
Guest: Like part of Tatsunoko.

734
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,079
Scott: It's a crazy game right there.

735
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,539
Guest: Samurai Pizza Cats is part of it.

736
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,734
Rym: I love that show.

737
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,620
Scott: The thing is, is that game ever going to be in this country?

738
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,130
Guest: That's the problem.

739
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,000
Guest: And I don't think it is.

740
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,380
Guest: I think we're going to have to import it because that's totally an arcade game, too.

741
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,759
Scott: That's not a console game, you know.

742
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,140
Scott: So we're we're definitely not going to see the arcade version.

743
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:46,779
Guest: I'm pretty sure they're going to probably put it on consoles at some point, but I really hope that that game doesn't suck because just like playing as the Gotcha Man characters is just awesome by itself.

744
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,542
Rym: I don't know.

745
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:52,580
Rym: Captain Tyler will do it for me because that show is one of my favorite shows in all of anime.

746
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,139
Rym: I just I love Captain Tyler.

747
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,147
Guest: Supermovus is just that he's.

748
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:58,379
Guest: he's just going to smack you over the head with a mallet.

749
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:01,779
Guest: That episode where he lit the ship on fire.

750
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:05,420
Guest: The Shio Kaze is just going to fly in and then crash.

751
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,220
Rym: I was always just a fan of the general who kept every time things screwed up, he just tried to commit seppuku and they're like, no, God damn it.

752
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:11,853
Rym: Stop that.

753
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:15,159
Guest: Captain Tyler, that would be neat if that made it in.

754
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:18,239
Guest: But there's so much to pull from, like Hurricane Polymer.

755
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,249
Scott: And I had no idea.

756
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:19,960
Guest: Tons and tons.

757
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:21,719
Guest: That's another kind of older show.

758
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:22,694
Scott: Yeah, I figured.

759
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:29,419
Rym: That's why Anime World Order is the more, I guess, literate anime podcast compared to GeekNights Wednesdays.

760
00:39:30,522 --> 00:39:31,280
Guest: Yeah, we try.

761
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,222
Scott: I definitely think that's what, you know, made me like Anime World Order in the first place.

762
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:41,260
Scott: You know, when I listened to it was that you knew all this information about anime that like no one else knew.

763
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:44,960
Scott: Like I was at Anime Club at RIT with like the biggest anime nerds in the universe.

764
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:48,240
Scott: But they if they knew the shit that you guys know, they weren't saying it.

765
00:39:48,421 --> 00:39:55,178
Scott: You know, they didn't know directors were they weren't you know, they didn't know all the really obscure stuff or anything like that.

766
00:39:55,921 --> 00:40:02,759
Guest: That's what a lifetime of dedicating yourself to only one thing will do will keep your blinders on everything else.

767
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,380
Guest: But you tend to know you tend to be super good at one thing only.

768
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,970
Guest: And that's that's.

769
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:09,998
Guest: that's the price you pay.

770
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:22,279
Rym: Plus, I feel like I mean, there's not a very well developed professional media or press presence when it comes to anime in the United States, not like video games and comics and all these other kind of traditional geek things.

771
00:40:22,581 --> 00:40:26,460
Rym: I mean, what our equivalent of the AP wire is basically the anime news network.

772
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:33,560
Rym: And then people like you guys and us are kind of like the second tier where there's the more commentary and opinion pieces.

773
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:39,839
Scott: The thing about the anime news network is the most professional, like top tier of media when it comes to anime and such.

774
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,880
Guest: And an anime news network is is good.

775
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:45,083
Scott: It is good.

776
00:40:45,183 --> 00:40:51,048
Guest: But it's like, yeah, I mean, that's that's I mean, basically the privilege they get is that they don't have to.

777
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:57,100
Guest: I don't actually know because I don't know them, but like they don't sign up for press at Otakon.

778
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:08,920
Guest: They're just assumed and they get if they have an interview with a guest there, it's not like an interview when I go to Otakon where I'll be sitting at a roundtable with like five other podcasters.

779
00:41:09,402 --> 00:41:11,979
Guest: They have it to themselves, every guest.

780
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:20,040
Scott: And but I'm just basically I'm just saying like, you know, we have anime, anime news network is pretty it's pretty good.

781
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,886
Scott: It's high quality.

782
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:21,168
Scott: Right.

783
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:22,760
Scott: But that's like the best we've got.

784
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:35,699
Scott: But compare that to, say, the media covering, you know, a different geekery, say, you know, look at the video game press, you know, and if you play if you had anime news network was about video games, it would be way low on the totem pole.

785
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:37,359
Scott: I mean, like it's lower than joystick.

786
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,459
Scott: It's lower than Kotaku.

787
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:39,305
Scott: It's lower than.

788
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:41,900
Scott: And those are that's sort of like the mid to low range.

789
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,300
Rym: But also look at the popularity.

790
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,140
Rym: I mean, just the anime in general, anime fandom and the way it is.

791
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,680
Rym: I mean, it's kind of it's it's very low hanging fruit in that regard.

792
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,061
Rym: And that like we go to Connecticut and it's like, yeah, do 11 panels, do whatever you want.

793
00:41:55,141 --> 00:41:55,785
Rym: Please come.

794
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:59,144
Rym: And we go to Otakon's like, well, you've been panels for the last six years.

795
00:41:59,204 --> 00:42:00,560
Rym: Here's your list of panels for this year.

796
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,919
Rym: And then we try to do a panel at PAX.

797
00:42:03,262 --> 00:42:05,320
Rym: And it's like, well, are you guys professionals?

798
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:06,577
Rym: I don't know about this.

799
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:07,842
Guest: Yeah.

800
00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:12,244
Guest: And the problem, the rough part is, is that for the most part, video game press still sort of sucks.

801
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:20,459
Guest: Like, yeah, outside of like outside of like, you know, and guy Kroll and such who actually have like something to say about it.

802
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:25,720
Guest: Like reviews on in the video, the world of video game like reviews is like its own show.

803
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,723
Guest: Oh, it's I'm sure.

804
00:42:26,784 --> 00:42:32,039
Rym: I mean, I'll be honest, my like my favorite video game press is still Dave and Joel.

805
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:39,400
Scott: Well, yeah, I think the Dave and Joel and you've also then guy Kroll and Zero Punctuation.

806
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:44,520
Rym: Yahtzee tells me what to play, Zero Punctuation and the Angry Video Game Nerd.

807
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:46,120
Rym: Those those press.

808
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,759
Rym: He does not tell you about games that you are going to play.

809
00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:49,544
Scott: He does.

810
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:52,780
Scott: He tells you about old games I didn't play and will not play in the future.

811
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,088
Scott: He's warning me.

812
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:55,139
Scott: He's the opposite of repeat.

813
00:42:56,441 --> 00:43:00,800
Rym: His show is just like you guys talking about OD over and over.

814
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:09,594
Guest: Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't know, video games, it's certainly more mature because the video game press has been around for 20 years now.

815
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,560
Rym: I think it's just that there's more money involved.

816
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,778
Rym: I think that's the only factor.

817
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,624
Guest: Yeah, there definitely isn't.

818
00:43:15,644 --> 00:43:22,660
Guest: I mean, anime, even though anime is very mainstream, it's still largely niche, while video games are no longer niche at all.

819
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:30,220
Rym: The anime industry is I don't want to say it's on the verge of collapse, but it's not doing well anymore in the US.

820
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,180
Rym: And I know there's a lot of reasons for that.

821
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,200
Rym: We could we could get you guys and us together on a separate show.

822
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,700
Rym: We could talk for a couple of hours about the video game industry.

823
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:44,819
Rym: I mean, it's pretty obvious that you guys talked about it recently and all I could think was, wow, I don't have anything to say except what they just said.

824
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:46,848
Guest: We we've got.

825
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:48,300
Guest: we still have a lot to say about it.

826
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:51,760
Guest: We're all just really hoping that it doesn't collapse.

827
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,919
Guest: And what's what's weird is that I was reading a I was going back in the archives, I was like editing some Wikipedia entries or something.

828
00:43:59,561 --> 00:44:07,441
Guest: And I was going back to like the press panels from Anime Boston 2006 at the ADV panel there.

829
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:13,020
Guest: And it's really funny because they were talking about how, oh, the crash that everybody predicted was over exaggerated.

830
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:19,562
Guest: And those are the exact words from Anime Boston, like anime and state of the industry panel.

831
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:22,420
Guest: So it's weird looking at that now.

832
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:29,139
Rym: Maybe if they weren't trying to primarily sell throwaway shows that people don't want to buy DVDs for the kids who don't have money.

833
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:32,600
Guest: It's it's very complicated.

834
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,619
Guest: I can't blame either side completely because both sides are.

835
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:47,380
Rym: I mean, granted, I have this feeling, though, that I mean, we talk about all the anime press isn't quite mature yet from every interaction I've ever had with the industry, and especially the people who bring the anime out over here.

836
00:44:47,440 --> 00:45:02,340
Rym: And I know you guys have more interaction with them, but it seems like the companies involved are run very much in many ways unprofessionally, or at least not as professionally as I would expect, you know, a corporation that is doing this sort of thing as its daily operations.

837
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,502
Guest: I don't know if I agree completely because I've I haven't had a chance to meet John Ledford.

838
00:45:08,562 --> 00:45:09,084
Guest: He was the head of

839
00:45:09,145 --> 00:45:09,566
Guest: A.D.V.,

840
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:13,528
Guest: but John Ledford is known as kind of the the businessman.

841
00:45:13,649 --> 00:45:14,760
Guest: He's not an anime fan.

842
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:15,302
Guest: He is.

843
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:16,840
Guest: he was design.

844
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,194
Guest: He went out there to run A.D.V.

845
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:19,605
Guest: as a business.

846
00:45:19,866 --> 00:45:22,379
Guest: And I believe that like the the kernel of A.D.V.

847
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,540
Guest: actually came from like Matt Greenfield and David Williams and those guys.

848
00:45:26,981 --> 00:45:34,626
Guest: But as far as like the other companies like Bandai Visual, I don't know who's running them.

849
00:45:34,686 --> 00:45:37,140
Scott: Well, Bandai Entertainment is actually very professional.

850
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:39,419
Scott: And Bandai Entertainment is also.

851
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:39,781
Scott: Well,

852
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:55,240
Rym: I guess I should have been more clear, because it's not I mean, not necessarily just the the actual, you know, we license anime and release it, but all the kind of tertiary and related industries like the the people who sell all the tchotchkes, the people who import those things, the people who make licensed merchandise.

853
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,640
Rym: Like remember when the MythBags company just disappeared?

854
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,040
Guest: Yeah, they I don't know what happened to them.

855
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,200
Guest: They just like their website wasn't being updated.

856
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,719
Guest: They weren't answering their phones or whatever.

857
00:46:05,642 --> 00:46:07,190
Rym: And that sort of thing is it's just.

858
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,700
Rym: it's a lot more common in the anime industry than it is in a lot of other even kind of niche industries.

859
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,480
Scott: Yeah, I mean, in the video game industry, when you have something like the Phantom Game Console, it's like a big deal.

860
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,580
Scott: It's like, holy shit, look, there's an unprofessional company.

861
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,377
Scott: What the hell is going on?

862
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:26,780
Guest: Yeah, I guess one of the problems is that there's no good example for the anime industry to follow, really.

863
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:41,900
Guest: Like like the the Kung Fu, like if you look at like the other niche like video markets, like the the Kung Fu movie industry in America, like not the ones, not the guys, the movies that are licensed by the big deal companies, but like the smaller companies.

864
00:46:42,502 --> 00:46:44,680
Guest: That is it is the worst thing in the world.

865
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:51,440
Guest: It must be to be like a martial arts movie fan in America because you get horrible dubs and the movies are cut up.

866
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,980
Guest: You still cannot get an uncut copy of Return of the Dragon today.

867
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,741
Scott: Wow.

868
00:46:55,862 --> 00:46:57,756
Scott: And not even on the BitTorrents?

869
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:03,825
Guest: Maybe on the BitTorrents, but I know that you cannot buy a DVD of Return of the Dragon uncut today.

870
00:47:04,127 --> 00:47:06,420
Rym: Well, you know, maybe that's it.

871
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,540
Rym: It's that, you know, that industry isn't trying to go like professional mainstream.

872
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:17,760
Rym: And it's a lot of these kind of flyby, like I never like when I get a Chinese action Kung Fu movie, I have no idea if it's a bootleg or not.

873
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,366
Rym: I don't care.

874
00:47:18,406 --> 00:47:19,840
Rym: It's always a different company putting them out.

875
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:26,080
Rym: And maybe it's just that the anime industry is a similar industry that's trying to break into the professional mainstream.

876
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:30,560
Rym: So they're only as a whole unit, like the entire industry is only halfway there.

877
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,780
Rym: So it looks bad, but it's not because it's sliding.

878
00:47:33,922 --> 00:47:35,079
Rym: It's just because it's trying.

879
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:36,542
Guest: Maybe.

880
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:41,263
Guest: There was a really good article that a really smart guy named Dave Merrill wrote about this.

881
00:47:42,146 --> 00:47:53,953
Guest: And he talked about how I think this was in relation maybe to also the American comic book industry in that the anime industry really wants to play with the big guys, but doesn't realize that it can't like.

882
00:47:54,414 --> 00:48:06,942
Guest: like if you take in other niche industries as well, like like toy trains or the doll, the guys, the doll making industry, like the doll making fandom, like they're quite happy being, you know, their small little niche thing.

883
00:48:07,644 --> 00:48:13,344
Guest: They're they're not like trying to get everybody to make dolls or everybody to to get into trains.

884
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:17,256
Guest: But anime, they're trying every they're trying to get everybody to watch anime.

885
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:29,000
Scott: Well, I think the reason for that, though, is if you look at, you know, say the people who make like, you know, little trains like Lionel or model rockets or anything like that, is that they don't have a lot of, you know, they don't see a lot of interest.

886
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,661
Scott: They look around and they have a few guys coming into the hobby shop every week and that's it.

887
00:48:33,183 --> 00:48:40,039
Scott: But imagine if you were running the hobby shop and like a million people came in every day, but you only made like one hundred dollars.

888
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,539
Scott: You'd be like all you could think is I got to do something about this.

889
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:49,279
Scott: You know, so if you're an anime company, you know, you you could just be a happy little niche kind of thing.

890
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,641
Scott: But so I think anime ego definitely goes that route of just being happy, being a niche thing.

891
00:48:53,702 --> 00:48:58,686
Scott: But, yeah, you go to Otakon, you see twenty thousand people and you're like, God damn it.

892
00:48:58,746 --> 00:49:01,300
Scott: Twenty thousand people are crazy enough to come all the way out here.

893
00:49:01,623 --> 00:49:03,160
Scott: Think about how many other people are out there.

894
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,019
Scott: I should be making some mad money off this.

895
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:05,565
Scott: What am I?

896
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:06,659
Scott: You know, this is not a niche.

897
00:49:07,501 --> 00:49:18,020
Guest: And that's the problem is that the the Japanese companies go to Otakon and Anime Expo when they see this and they're like, well, every person here obviously, you know, represents many more people in America.

898
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,421
Guest: Therefore, if we release our crappy show over here, then it's going to be a gigantic seller.

899
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:35,545
Guest: And they don't realize that that audience that you see, like less people that go to Otakon are going to buy the eighty dollars for, you know, the Sento Iose Yukikaze on DVD.

900
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,300
Scott: Well, at eighty dollars, that's for sure.

901
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,145
Guest: Or like one hundred dollars.

902
00:49:40,547 --> 00:49:50,955
Guest: Sento Iose Yukikaze is like one of these weird things where Bandai Entertainment released it for like thirty dollars over here and then they lost the license and then Bandai Visual picked it up and sold it for like one hundred dollars or something.

903
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:51,400
Rym: Brilliant.

904
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:52,786
Guest: Yeah.

905
00:49:52,908 --> 00:49:53,980
Scott: No one bought this for thirty.

906
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,028
Scott: Let's sell it for a hundred.

907
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:55,936
Scott: Then people will buy it.

908
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:56,761
Guest: Yeah.

909
00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:03,019
Rym: Well, especially it's really hard to buy a crappy show for a lot of money when I can still buy Cowboy Bebop for thirty bucks.

910
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:12,699
Guest: Yeah, and I mean, the repack, like I guess it's people aren't really buying a lot of the new stuff as well, like they they just keep replying the old stuff.

911
00:50:13,663 --> 00:50:14,479
Rym: So I've done that.

912
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,680
Rym: I bought Eska Floname almost twice.

913
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:17,862
Guest: Yeah.

914
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:22,160
Guest: And I guess there are crazy people who have bought Evangelion four times.

915
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:22,862
Rym: Oh, yeah.

916
00:50:22,902 --> 00:50:27,640
Rym: The VHS, the DVD, the better DVD, the more better DVD.

917
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:28,642
Guest: Yeah.

918
00:50:28,682 --> 00:50:32,060
Guest: The one that was going to come out that had like a jacket in it and such.

919
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,787
Scott: Those people definitely exist.

920
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:38,760
Scott: because I was in an ADV panel at Otakon, I think, maybe three or four years ago for like five minutes.

921
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,160
Scott: I think I was in this panel and people were standing up being like, you know, when is it?

922
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,640
Scott: Tell me more about this new Evangelion box you're making.

923
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:58,260
Scott: That is somehow different from the previous box, which I own and the procs before that, which I own because, you know, they didn't actually say they own the previous boxes, but this wasn't someone who had never seen Evangelion before.

924
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,536
Scott: That was for sure.

925
00:50:59,557 --> 00:50:59,780
Guest: Right.

926
00:51:00,461 --> 00:51:09,642
Guest: And yeah, like the licensing, like I guess people don't realize that anime is like 80 percent merchandising and so much of the merchandising that we get is just like imported from Japan.

927
00:51:10,626 --> 00:51:11,067
Guest: There's not.

928
00:51:11,128 --> 00:51:14,640
Guest: there's not as much like domestic merchandising, I should say.

929
00:51:15,403 --> 00:51:36,739
Rym: It seems like comics are definitely going the route where like we at the New York Comic-Con, you saw a lot of this and there's some anime stuff, too, but the kind of high class licensed properties, the like the nice, very expensive, but very fancy looking bust of the major and that sort of thing that it's worked really well for the comic industry because the comic nerds will spend a lot of money on those things.

930
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:42,020
Guest: Oh, that's why you have those crazy, awesome solo chogakins in Japan.

931
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,204
Guest: Those are the.

932
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:53,620
Guest: those are the super awesome die cast metal like figures of of robots.

933
00:51:54,020 --> 00:52:02,419
Guest: They'll have like Mazinger Z and and they'll have like obscure shows like Gold Lighton and God Mars, these obscure shows from the 70s.

934
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,840
Guest: And they'll make these hundred plus dollar solo chogakins things.

935
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,165
Guest: I don't believe you call them figures.

936
00:52:07,185 --> 00:52:11,203
Guest: You call them like lifestyle accessories or something.

937
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:16,018
Guest: So, yeah, I mean, I'm not saying that we should go that route because that's.

938
00:52:16,982 --> 00:52:20,419
Guest: but I do want one of those solo chogakins Mazinger Z.

939
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,060
Scott: I'd take one for less than a hundred dollars, but not paying that money for it.

940
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:33,260
Scott: But yeah, definitely like I look even in Japan, not just for anime, but it seems like Japan is much better at merchandising almost everything.

941
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:40,003
Scott: I mean, you go to like any Japanese convenience store and you can get like a Mario toothbrush.

942
00:52:40,346 --> 00:52:42,100
Scott: You can get a Mario anything almost.

943
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,818
Scott: You can get a Hello Kitty almost anything.

944
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,048
Guest: But in Japan.

945
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:45,839
Guest: Yeah, go on.

946
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:52,900
Scott: But in the US, right, if you go to the toothbrush aisle, you know, the only place you're going to see licensed thing is on like a kid's toothbrush.

947
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,340
Scott: And you're only going to have a choice between like three things.

948
00:52:55,781 --> 00:53:00,304
Scott: Yet there's, you know, hundreds of popular properties, but there's only like three toothbrushes.

949
00:53:00,324 --> 00:53:03,420
Rym: So you're saying that you would buy a Makoto toothbrush?

950
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:04,660
Scott: I'd buy a Gundam toothbrush.

951
00:53:05,222 --> 00:53:06,440
Guest: I'd buy a rape man toothbrush.

952
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,140
Scott: Yeah, it had to come up sometime.

953
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:11,023
Rym: All right.

954
00:53:11,043 --> 00:53:15,325
Rym: Well, at any rate, before we wrap up, we should get in a couple more non anime questions.

955
00:53:15,385 --> 00:53:17,020
Rym: So what should we ask?

956
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,347
Rym: Because I don't want to go the route of.

957
00:53:18,668 --> 00:53:20,940
Rym: so is there ever strife in the anime world order?

958
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,700
Rym: How much do you guys hate each other?

959
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:24,139
Guest: Oh, we hate each other a lot.

960
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:32,918
Scott: Do you do you have any like, you know, we pretty much got over, you know, what your hobbies, do you have any hobbies that like aren't generally considered geeky?

961
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:34,919
Guest: I work out a lot.

962
00:53:36,122 --> 00:53:38,840
Guest: I exercise, but I don't know if that's considered a hobby.

963
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:40,499
Rym: Like I think it is.

964
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,750
Rym: If you enjoy it, I enjoy.

965
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:50,239
Rym: I see people who work out and it's like they hate every minute of it, like they're lifting these little weights and they're like, I hate working out, but I'm fat and I don't want to be fat.

966
00:53:54,224 --> 00:53:54,606
Guest: I do it.

967
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:56,500
Guest: I don't enjoy working out.

968
00:53:57,241 --> 00:54:07,460
Guest: I don't enjoy it as much when I'm actually working out, but I do very much enjoyed when I'm finished because I feel like I've accomplished something like even though what I've accomplished is extremely minor.

969
00:54:08,202 --> 00:54:11,879
Guest: But yeah, I working out, I guess, is not typically a geeky thing.

970
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,222
Guest: They need to develop some sort of system where people can like watch anime and work out easily.

971
00:54:17,282 --> 00:54:20,680
Guest: Like you should watch Fighting Spirit, Hajime No Ippo.

972
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,160
Rym: That show will make you want to live the way you want to watch it.

973
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,319
Rym: Yeah, because Initial D really made me want to drive my car very dangerously.

974
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:34,517
Guest: They should just pull your car into the lounge and just like drift in your lounge while you're watching Initial D.

975
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:43,540
Rym: All right, so we'll end on a bunch of kind of quick, easy questions like now, obviously, it's a bad question is what's your favorite movie ever?

976
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,103
Rym: But name like, I don't know, three or four movies, anime or not, just that you really, really like.

977
00:54:48,123 --> 00:54:49,559
Rym: We'll get a picture of Gerald here.

978
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,059
Rym: Like what do you like or not?

979
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:55,720
Guest: I'll just run off a couple, but most of them are probably going to be animated.

980
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:57,440
Guest: But let's see.

981
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,094
Guest: I really like The Goonies, the 1980s movie.

982
00:55:01,082 --> 00:55:02,028
Guest: I'm a big fan of that.

983
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:03,700
Guest: I acknowledge that it's probably not a good movie.

984
00:55:04,265 --> 00:55:04,750
Guest: Oh, it's.

985
00:55:04,892 --> 00:55:05,700
Rym: it's awesome.

986
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:07,838
Guest: But I love it to death.

987
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:13,200
Guest: I really like Galifor's Eternal Story for an anime movie.

988
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:16,600
Guest: That's I really like Murder by Death.

989
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,502
Guest: It's kind of an.

990
00:55:18,144 --> 00:55:24,199
Guest: it's an 70s murder mystery that kind of made fun of a lot of the tropes of murder mysteries at the time.

991
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,500
Scott: I never heard of that from Netflix.

992
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:31,802
Guest: It's that they have like Ecule Poirot and all of these people all in one mansion at once.

993
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:34,420
Guest: And Truman Capote is in it, like the writer.

994
00:55:36,282 --> 00:55:38,520
Guest: Just at the end, it's a pretty awesome little movie.

995
00:55:39,822 --> 00:55:42,460
Guest: I like Wings of Oneamis a lot.

996
00:55:42,761 --> 00:55:43,740
Guest: That's probably what that movie is.

997
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:47,860
Rym: I watched like an eighth generation fan sub where you couldn't even read the subtitles.

998
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,200
Scott: Damn you, Bandai Visual.

999
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,599
Scott: I'll buy it if you make it cheap.

1000
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:51,843
Scott: Why is it really?

1001
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:54,232
Guest: in a way I feel really bad?

1002
00:55:54,292 --> 00:56:01,419
Guest: because the guy that wrote that movie was twenty three years old and I'm older than him and I've done less with my life than he has when he.

1003
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:11,531
Rym: Don't worry, because we realize that Formula One drivers who have tens of millions of dollars, they're the most highly paid professional athletes in the world, are younger than us.

1004
00:56:12,422 --> 00:56:14,359
Scott: Oh, you know that video game pianist guy?

1005
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,829
Scott: What's his name?

1006
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:19,120
Scott: We met him like a few years ago and at the time.

1007
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,300
Guest: Yeah, not piano squall.

1008
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,520
Rym: No, no, I don't think you understand the depth of Martin.

1009
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,371
Scott: Martin Long.

1010
00:56:25,391 --> 00:56:25,513
Scott: Martin.

1011
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:26,711
Guest: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:27,119
Guest: That guy.

1013
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,340
Scott: Yeah, we met him and we were like 20 something.

1014
00:56:29,562 --> 00:56:31,520
Scott: We must have been like twenty four, twenty three.

1015
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,818
Rym: It was like last year.

1016
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:33,424
Rym: No, it wasn't.

1017
00:56:33,444 --> 00:56:34,151
Rym: It was two years ago.

1018
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,078
Scott: So we were twenty four, twenty five ish.

1019
00:56:37,543 --> 00:56:38,718
Scott: He was nineteen at the time.

1020
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:43,762
Rym: And I remember we were sitting with like the con chair of this con and then him and then us two.

1021
00:56:44,124 --> 00:56:46,879
Rym: And he reels his age and all of us look at each other and go.

1022
00:56:49,502 --> 00:56:51,739
Scott: He's a really nice, nice and modest guy, though.

1023
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:52,842
Guest: That's cool.

1024
00:56:53,264 --> 00:56:57,997
Guest: Modesty is a is a great, great thing to have, especially especially the more awesome that you are.

1025
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:03,000
Rym: Yeah, I always like that, like the sleeper car where it looks like a piece of crap, but then it beats off the line.

1026
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,132
Guest: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1027
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,120
Guest: Let's see other movies.

1028
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:10,160
Guest: I'm a. I really love Porco Rosso.

1029
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,740
Guest: I think that's Miyazaki's best movie.

1030
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,819
Rym: We were just talking about that yesterday.

1031
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,427
Guest: I think that that's probably his least.

1032
00:57:17,652 --> 00:57:19,440
Guest: it was his least successful movie for a reason.

1033
00:57:19,981 --> 00:57:23,380
Guest: And I think it was for good reasons, even though I think it should have been successful.

1034
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:32,018
Guest: Other movies that I like, I'm trying to think of like some some non anime movies and I'm trying to think of like things that people might not expect.

1035
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,436
Guest: Tootsie.

1036
00:57:39,187 --> 00:57:40,098
Guest: Tootsie is an awesome movie.

1037
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:40,966
Rym: Actually, it is.

1038
00:57:41,047 --> 00:57:42,020
Scott: I can't really make fun of it.

1039
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,545
Scott: It's not bad.

1040
00:57:42,707 --> 00:57:43,577
Scott: My mom loves Tootsie.

1041
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,386
Guest: Yeah.

1042
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,760
Guest: What's I'm looking at my shelf now.

1043
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:49,678
Guest: Project Aco I really like.

1044
00:57:52,044 --> 00:57:53,719
Guest: We just talked about that, so that shouldn't count.

1045
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,080
Rym: How about any TV like any one of those people who watch like The Simpsons or anything?

1046
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,140
Guest: Oh, God, I'm so bad on that.

1047
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:00,562
Guest: I like.

1048
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:03,460
Guest: I like watch virtually no American TV.

1049
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:03,945
Scott: Good.

1050
00:58:03,986 --> 00:58:04,499
Scott: Good for you.

1051
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:05,259
Scott: We don't either.

1052
00:58:05,821 --> 00:58:07,278
Guest: Well, the sad part is that I have cable.

1053
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:09,159
Rym: No, just get rid of it.

1054
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:11,480
Rym: We actually haven't had cable in like a decade.

1055
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,169
Guest: Yeah, but I watch like.

1056
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:17,360
Guest: I watch like The Simpsons and those sorts of things.

1057
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,160
Guest: And then I'll watch Ninja Warrior.

1058
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,719
Scott: And yeah, I like that.

1059
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,339
Rym: Awesome.

1060
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,200
Guest: And Unbeatable Banzouke.

1061
00:58:25,542 --> 00:58:26,178
Scott: I don't know what that is.

1062
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,980
Rym: Did you ever watch American Gladiators back in the day?

1063
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,040
Guest: Back in the day, I caught a couple of episodes of it and I saw that they were making a new show.

1064
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:40,099
Guest: And apparently the I'm told by my friends that the new American Gladiators are some of the roughest people that they've ever seen.

1065
00:58:41,763 --> 00:58:43,780
Scott: Yeah, we'll have to check out at least one episode.

1066
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,300
Scott: Maybe it's online somewhere or something.

1067
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:48,471
Scott: Are there any books you like that?

1068
00:58:48,511 --> 00:58:50,580
Scott: are, you know, like words, not pictures?

1069
00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:51,720
Guest: Wordy books.

1070
00:58:54,806 --> 00:58:55,640
Guest: Yeah, let's see.

1071
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,239
Guest: I really like The Count of Monte Cristo.

1072
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:00,640
Guest: I'm just turning that up again.

1073
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,999
Rym: What translation do you like?

1074
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:03,068
Guest: I'm nuts.

1075
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:10,900
Rym: I'm just curious, because if you thought you liked the book, read it again with the most recent Penguin Books translation.

1076
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,020
Scott: The Unabridged Penguin?

1077
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,216
Rym: Yes, it makes it.

1078
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:18,917
Rym: I was surprised that I could read a book again and like it more just because it's translated differently.

1079
00:59:20,246 --> 00:59:21,200
Guest: Now, I need to give that a shot.

1080
00:59:21,482 --> 00:59:22,319
Guest: I don't have that edition.

1081
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:45,279
Guest: There's a couple of like weird books here and there, like there's this one very weird little book that came out some years ago called Angry White Pajamas, which is about this skinny little like Oxford poet that goes to Japan to and gets training in the Japanese riot school, Japanese riot police like training program.

1082
00:59:47,269 --> 00:59:47,999
Guest: He almost dies.

1083
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:50,440
Scott: Oh, I see.

1084
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,379
Scott: I see the book right here.

1085
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,459
Scott: It's ten bucks on Amazon.

1086
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,418
Guest: Yeah, it's a. it's a weird, interesting little book.

1087
00:59:57,902 --> 00:59:59,730
Rym: Like any genres of fiction you like, like.

1088
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:04,079
Rym: do you like fantasy books or science fiction or speculative fiction?

1089
01:00:06,404 --> 01:00:09,270
Guest: Oh, I like.

1090
01:00:10,132 --> 01:00:19,698
Guest: I've tried reading some more science fiction, but it's it's hard for me to get into that because I I have no idea what's going on in the world of science fiction writing today.

1091
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,879
Guest: And everybody I talk to has got totally different opinions on what to read.

1092
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,200
Rym: Yeah, it seems the same way for me with fantasy books.

1093
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:34,440
Rym: I finally we have one guy in the front row crew who pretty much if I want a fantasy book, I go to him and say, hey, Alex, give me a fantasy book that I will like.

1094
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,978
Rym: And he just hands me something and I read it.

1095
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:39,980
Scott: I think the key with sci fi is you just you know, you don't want to go for the new stuff.

1096
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:46,260
Scott: Just try to read all as many of the old classics as you can, you know, like the Asimov's and the Heinlein's and all that business.

1097
01:00:46,361 --> 01:00:50,664
Scott: And then by the time you run out of that, you might be an old man not being able to read anymore anyway.

1098
01:00:50,724 --> 01:00:53,279
Scott: So, you know, don't worry about the other stuff.

1099
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:57,238
Guest: Like I really like the original Conan a lot.

1100
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,780
Guest: Hmm, because I really like the philosophy in Conan.

1101
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:12,480
Rym: You know, if you like, you should join the GeekNights book club and read that book that we've been talking about for the last like a year, The Prince of Nothing.

1102
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,200
Rym: I, I don't think I can recommend that book enough.

1103
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,360
Rym: And if you like the Conan, then you will probably enjoy The Prince of Nothing.

1104
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,260
Scott: Probably like the Nayer.

1105
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:21,700
Rym: I think Nayer is up your alley.

1106
01:01:22,642 --> 01:01:23,140
Rym: WEEPER!

1107
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:30,959
Rym: Nayer is the most violent of men, breaker of horses and men.

1108
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,900
Guest: Oh, so is he more violent than than Riccio?

1109
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,239
Scott: You know, he's pretty close.

1110
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,475
Rym: Maybe not in terms of spraying blood, but in terms of like.

1111
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:47,719
Rym: you look at a man and you try to gauge based on the way he's described the amount of violence contained within him.

1112
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:51,719
Rym: He is definitely Nayer, Sko, Eartha, most violent of men.

1113
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,060
Scott: You know how in like Fist of the North Star, right, like Ken Shiro is really big, but all the guys he kills are like twice his size.

1114
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:58,920
Scott: Yeah.

1115
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:08,680
Scott: Now imagine if you sort of flip it around and it's like the whole world is normal guys and there's one guy who's twice the size of everybody, but he doesn't just get he doesn't go down like a chump.

1116
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:12,120
Scott: He's actually twice the size and twice as bad ass as everyone else.

1117
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,380
Rym: And he's not even the main character.

1118
01:02:14,681 --> 01:02:15,538
Rym: He's just there.

1119
01:02:15,821 --> 01:02:19,499
Scott: He's like this supporting character barbarian who just fucking kills everybody.

1120
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,559
Guest: So how many people does he punch directly in the mouth and punch their brains out?

1121
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,305
Scott: Quite a few.

1122
01:02:27,566 --> 01:02:29,720
Scott: All I can think is depends on your interpretation.

1123
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:35,864
Rym: All I can think is that is the face of a man who has no option but to try to kill Dracula with his face.

1124
01:02:35,904 --> 01:02:39,000
Scott: Yeah, I think he actually punches a horse's brains out at one point.

1125
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:50,236
Rym: I mean, I can say, yeah, I mean, is also their cultures where whenever they kill a man, they have to scar their arm and it's symbolic and they carry the weight of that man's soul on them and this sort of.

1126
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,599
Rym: And he is also Nersk or the most scarred of men.

1127
01:02:54,101 --> 01:02:54,504
Scott: Yeah.

1128
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:56,600
Scott: Like the guy has scars all over his body.

1129
01:02:56,741 --> 01:03:00,920
Scott: And if you know that each scar means he killed someone, that's that's quite frightening.

1130
01:03:02,202 --> 01:03:02,467
Guest: Right.

1131
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:03,057
Guest: I wouldn't.

1132
01:03:03,441 --> 01:03:03,585
Guest: Yeah.

1133
01:03:04,055 --> 01:03:04,239
Scott: Yeah.

1134
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:09,548
Scott: And like, you know, all his barbarian friends who do the same thing have like a few scars on one arm.

1135
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:10,054
Rym: You know what?

1136
01:03:10,094 --> 01:03:10,540
Rym: I'll say this.

1137
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,707
Rym: Go whenever you get a chance.

1138
01:03:11,728 --> 01:03:15,740
Rym: You should probably listen to the GeekNights book club about it, because I don't think we want to derail the show.

1139
01:03:16,322 --> 01:03:17,739
Scott: No, we're already derailed here.

1140
01:03:18,402 --> 01:03:19,999
Guest: But was it on rails to begin with?

1141
01:03:23,584 --> 01:03:23,847
Scott: All right.

1142
01:03:24,677 --> 01:03:24,839
Scott: So.

1143
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:26,265
Rym: So.

1144
01:03:26,689 --> 01:03:26,972
Rym: All right.

1145
01:03:27,093 --> 01:03:27,760
Rym: One last one.

1146
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,260
Rym: This is so Anime World Order.

1147
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,120
Rym: Do you guys have a kind of a vision of the future?

1148
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,002
Rym: Are you?

1149
01:03:33,304 --> 01:03:33,524
Rym: are you?

1150
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:33,745
Rym: do you?

1151
01:03:33,886 --> 01:03:40,474
Rym: I mean, even if it's not one of those like feasible things, if you could, would you try to go pro with it and live like?

1152
01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:42,124
Rym: that is your life and that is your job?

1153
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:43,619
Guest: Oh, fuck yes.

1154
01:03:44,082 --> 01:03:45,239
Rym: That's all I wanted to hear.

1155
01:03:46,061 --> 01:03:49,840
Guest: If we could if we could like sustain ourselves, that would be awesome.

1156
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:59,960
Guest: But I think I think as you keep going in the world of podcasting, you you have your like original goal and then you're like, oh, well, I guess this is not attainable.

1157
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:05,188
Guest: Then I guess our goal is well, originally our goal was to have, I believe, a hundred listeners.

1158
01:04:05,555 --> 01:04:05,819
Scott: Wow.

1159
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,860
Guest: We could get 100 listeners to then we would be happy.

1160
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,480
Rym: And I think you got that.

1161
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,275
Rym: I think they've got a few more than 100 listeners.

1162
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:15,461
Guest: Yeah.

1163
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:28,438
Guest: Well, the rough part is that if we got like we got to like a thousand listeners really quickly and then to get to two thousand listeners subscribed, like on on our on our blog.

1164
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:28,821
Rym: Yeah.

1165
01:04:28,841 --> 01:04:32,360
Rym: Well, remember, there's only like three thousand people listening to podcasts.

1166
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:33,440
Guest: Yeah.

1167
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:43,645
Guest: And and the thing is that we we have a hard time like getting the exact numbers because there's probably at least double or triple the number of people that just download it directly.

1168
01:04:43,766 --> 01:04:46,982
Scott: It's very it's very, very difficult to figure out exactly how many people.

1169
01:04:47,002 --> 01:04:58,139
Rym: I mean, you look at the stats and it's like if you do a real statistical analysis, like people like us can say things like, wow, I can say with a ninety five percent degree of certainty that I have between fifty and five thousand listeners.

1170
01:04:58,681 --> 01:05:07,799
Guest: That that's pretty much like how we are like and it's rough because we did have like some advertisers come to us and they said they want to know they want to know.

1171
01:05:08,062 --> 01:05:09,278
Guest: And I understand that they want to know.

1172
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,320
Guest: And but we can't give them exact numbers.

1173
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:17,479
Guest: We can give them a very we can give them a relatively narrow range, but they want something more narrow.

1174
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,040
Scott: Yeah, I think the trick there is to just lie.

1175
01:05:20,581 --> 01:05:21,565
Scott: That way you'll get money.

1176
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:28,598
Rym: or just what we usually do is we tell the advertisers when they come basically that unless you can give us enough money, that's just.

1177
01:05:28,618 --> 01:05:30,065
Scott: that's our personal policy.

1178
01:05:30,105 --> 01:05:33,771
Scott: that, you know, if I was actually if I didn't have that policy, I wouldn't be saying this.

1179
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:34,459
Rym: Yeah.

1180
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:41,600
Guest: Speaking of which, what is the weirdest swag that you guys think that you would ever like do for GeekNights?

1181
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:46,881
Scott: I got we're doing a pretty weird swag, depending on your point of view, pretty soon.

1182
01:05:47,102 --> 01:05:58,486
Guest: Well, I'm thinking of like GeekNights condoms, GeekNights, you know, stamps on apples at the grocery store to steal from our last match game, the GeekNights' pregnancy test.

1183
01:05:59,494 --> 01:06:00,220
Guest: Oh, that's a good one.

1184
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,920
Rym: Well, I mean, considering that our listeners, I don't know if you guys get this.

1185
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,494
Rym: I don't think you do to the degree that we do, which is it's.

1186
01:06:07,856 --> 01:06:08,600
Rym: it's not frightening.

1187
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:08,961
Rym: It's just.

1188
01:06:09,463 --> 01:06:20,639
Rym: I never, ever thought in my entire life up until now that there would be a point in my future where there would be fan fiction slash gay doujinshi about me.

1189
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:35,159
Rym: That and and the fact that it's there and the and the worst part is now we're making this T-shirt and now I think it's like, wow, there's going to be a T-shirt with my face on it and someone other than me might wear it.

1190
01:06:35,802 --> 01:06:38,740
Rym: I don't know what to do about that, but we're making this shirt.

1191
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,480
Rym: Actually, Emily is making it and we're saying make it please.

1192
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:50,779
Rym: But it's our this catchphrase from a long time ago, you know, get the hell off my Internet's and it caught on.

1193
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,539
Rym: So we, you know, two years later decide to make the shirt about it.

1194
01:06:54,961 --> 01:06:58,980
Rym: And it's this Soviet propaganda poster like straight out of Soviet propaganda.

1195
01:06:59,401 --> 01:07:03,682
Rym: And it's a stylized room and a stylized Scott standing in that Soviet way, fingers pointing.

1196
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:05,551
Rym: And it says, get the partner off.

1197
01:07:05,592 --> 01:07:08,880
Rym: my Internet's partner, of course, is whatever the Cyrillic is for hell.

1198
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:10,520
Rym: And it's pretty snazzy looking.

1199
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:11,138
Rym: Yeah.

1200
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:12,581
Guest: Neat.

1201
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:17,923
Guest: We we really have not done much with this merchandising just because we just don't have the time.

1202
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,971
Rym: Oh, forget not just the time.

1203
01:07:20,032 --> 01:07:22,924
Rym: it like getting like even our vinyl banner and stuff like.

1204
01:07:22,944 --> 01:07:27,284
Rym: you need to do a lot of kind of difficult stuff to get these things printed.

1205
01:07:27,364 --> 01:07:30,280
Rym: And you got to have a lot of money up front and then the taxes.

1206
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,172
Scott: And it's yeah, I think that's the thing about podcasting.

1207
01:07:33,232 --> 01:07:39,420
Scott: is podcasting requires, you know, knowledge about what you're podcasting about, speaking abilities, right.

1208
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:43,240
Scott: You know, radio abilities, which is sort of an add on to speaking abilities.

1209
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:44,404
Guest: You don't have.

1210
01:07:44,444 --> 01:07:51,200
Scott: you got to have the audio technology abilities and you got to have the computer abilities, you know, doing websites and things.

1211
01:07:51,702 --> 01:08:01,140
Scott: So if you're someone who has all those abilities, it's going to be a rare case where you also have like graphic design, digital printing abilities.

1212
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,222
Guest: Yeah, well, we're lucky in that Clarissa is a really good graphic designer, so we have that as well.

1213
01:08:08,724 --> 01:08:12,439
Guest: And I'm good at standing around and doing nothing.

1214
01:08:14,044 --> 01:08:15,459
Guest: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1215
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,346
Guest: We just have not done what.

1216
01:08:17,769 --> 01:08:20,439
Guest: what we really, I don't think we really planned on it.

1217
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,419
Guest: It was just kind of like, wow, people want T-shirts of our show.

1218
01:08:24,381 --> 01:08:25,259
Guest: Yeah, we'll do some T-shirts.

1219
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,505
Rym: Let's just little things like.

1220
01:08:26,566 --> 01:08:29,120
Rym: our website's been this ugly looking WordPress forever.

1221
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:30,578
Rym: And we're finally trying to redo that.

1222
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,219
Scott: And it's I really got to talk about that after the show.

1223
01:08:33,662 --> 01:08:34,005
Rym: Oh, we do?

1224
01:08:34,127 --> 01:08:34,287
Rym: Yeah.

1225
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:35,319
Rym: We got to pay her, right?

1226
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:35,765
Rym: Yeah.

1227
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:36,050
Rym: Yeah.

1228
01:08:36,456 --> 01:08:36,598
Scott: OK.

1229
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:41,859
Rym: We paid one of our friends to redesign our website because she happens to be a professional graphic designer.

1230
01:08:42,361 --> 01:08:43,118
Scott: Like actually, probably.

1231
01:08:43,682 --> 01:08:45,439
Guest: Yeah, probably the best thing to go with them.

1232
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,600
Rym: Actually, we're trying Scott's working on it now.

1233
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:56,241
Rym: I think we're going to actually just write our own content management system in Django and just use that entirely and just give up on this WordPress crap so we can do a lot more.

1234
01:08:56,684 --> 01:08:59,197
Rym: I guess if it works, if you guys like it, we could just give it to you.

1235
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:00,585
Guest: That'd be cool.

1236
01:09:00,706 --> 01:09:02,479
Scott: It'll be sort of custom made for our show.

1237
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,300
Scott: Those seem like, you know, things of the day, searches and stuff.

1238
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,580
Rym: Well, honestly, I think is the way that sort of stuff works.

1239
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:15,572
Rym: This is I I'll give you an open letter to Anime World Order because I feel like there's a way that you guys could really bust out in a big way.

1240
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:17,359
Rym: is you keep doing the long shows.

1241
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:22,479
Rym: But get like a Libsyn account and break every show up into each discrete bit.

1242
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:30,680
Rym: So whenever you record a show and you put it up, have a news feed that's just like all the news is and a review feed that's just like all the reviews as individual bites.

1243
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:34,359
Rym: And I think you'll get a lot more casual listenership.

1244
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:37,080
Rym: And that's the kind of thing that we would do if we had time.

1245
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:40,040
Rym: And I know you'll say, oh, yeah, we would do that if we had time.

1246
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:49,640
Guest: But that's an idea because we've kind of hit like this block where we I think we've got about as many people listening to the show as well as are listening to podcasts.

1247
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,133
Scott: Yeah, we sort of had a plateau on our download graph.

1248
01:09:52,214 --> 01:09:57,060
Scott: also, you know, even though you don't know what the numbers are, you can see on the chart it sort of went up and then sort of flat.

1249
01:09:57,803 --> 01:09:58,017
Guest: Yeah.

1250
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,540
Guest: It's it's inching up a bit.

1251
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:10,557
Guest: It's now like I don't really know how we were not too sure what we need to do because we want to keep our old listeners because we love our old listeners because they've been with us since the beginning and we love them all.

1252
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:18,820
Rym: It seems like what you have to because like we're trying to do something similar where people need if you want to get linked to it has to be like this discrete unit.

1253
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:24,940
Rym: Like if someone links to your show and says, oh, my God, there's a great review of Odean or whatever.

1254
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:28,340
Rym: And then you guys talk about a bunch of other stuff, which we get this problem all the time.

1255
01:10:28,802 --> 01:10:30,819
Rym: It doesn't get linked to as often as and hook people in.

1256
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:39,040
Rym: But if there's also that direct link where people can say, man, check out this review of Mazen Kaiser and they link directly to just the review of Mazen Kaiser.

1257
01:10:39,523 --> 01:10:40,959
Rym: And then they go, oh, it's by these guys.

1258
01:10:41,342 --> 01:10:42,480
Rym: Oh, look, they reviewed that other show.

1259
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:42,878
Rym: I like.

1260
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:44,919
Rym: Oh, hey, I can just listen to the whole show.

1261
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:45,700
Scott: Yeah.

1262
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:50,888
Scott: The YouTube generation definitely wants lots of smaller things as opposed to fewer bigger things.

1263
01:10:51,597 --> 01:10:51,860
Guest: Yeah.

1264
01:10:52,240 --> 01:11:01,784
Guest: I mean, on the other hand, we're kind of aiming for that that office worker that just wants sort of some hum in the background while they work so that they don't actually have to listen to it.

1265
01:11:01,864 --> 01:11:05,662
Guest: But it's entertaining in some sort of some sort of subconscious way.

1266
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:08,740
Rym: I feel like the way to go is you have to do both.

1267
01:11:09,123 --> 01:11:10,540
Rym: And I think we're going to try to do both.

1268
01:11:10,621 --> 01:11:12,599
Rym: So if it works, we can show you how to do both.

1269
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:18,540
Guest: Yeah, that's kind of a weird thing with podcasting, like you don't see people really running to podcasting anymore.

1270
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,999
Guest: It's sort of that was sort of like two years ago now.

1271
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,148
Guest: And now it's sort of that's we would.

1272
01:11:24,152 --> 01:11:26,407
Guest: there's really no killer app and podcasting just yet.

1273
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:27,728
Rym: Well, there isn't even a good like.

1274
01:11:27,768 --> 01:11:30,420
Rym: I mean, there's iTunes and that's really the best you've got to even listen.

1275
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,339
Rym: And most people don't even know what podcasts are.

1276
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:32,761
Rym: Yeah.

1277
01:11:33,082 --> 01:11:38,760
Scott: It's like it got really big and then it leveled off before people really figured it out, you know?

1278
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:39,041
Guest: Yeah.

1279
01:11:39,182 --> 01:11:46,880
Guest: And the thing is, is that I'm not even against people calling them netcasts because so many people I say podcast to, they still think they need an iPod.

1280
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,900
Rym: God, our flyer even says that on the back.

1281
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:51,720
Rym: You don't need an iPod or iTunes or a Mac.

1282
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:52,841
Guest: Yeah.

1283
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:55,340
Guest: And so the naming needs to change.

1284
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,500
Guest: Something something needs to happen where people start listening to podcasts again.

1285
01:12:00,221 --> 01:12:05,047
Guest: Or maybe it's just at that point where, you know, how can you get more people to watch television?

1286
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:05,919
Guest: You can't really do it.

1287
01:12:06,341 --> 01:12:13,580
Rym: It's I think we can, though, because I think just the technology has to get to the point where people carry something like an iPod or a cell phone thing.

1288
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:20,558
Rym: But instead of like I go home, I run my podcatcher, I sync up, I go out because only like there's a certain kind of person who does that.

1289
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:28,440
Rym: It was just like the radio, if it was like on demand radio all the time where someone's like, I want to listen to a review of anime and they hit anime in their cell phone.

1290
01:12:28,641 --> 01:12:29,478
Rym: Oh, anime world order.

1291
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:34,560
Guest: Yeah, it definitely has to go beyond to do something like that.

1292
01:12:35,382 --> 01:12:43,360
Guest: Like I have got an iPod and it's still annoying for me when I have to unplug it, load up iTunes, let the shows download, sync it up, take it back out.

1293
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,840
Scott: That's the worst part is that the iPods in the Zunes have Wi-Fi now.

1294
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:48,820
Scott: This is technologically within reach.

1295
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:49,642
Scott: You can have it.

1296
01:12:49,843 --> 01:13:01,019
Scott: It's technologically possible on the iPod touch if the software was there, which it isn't for you to, you know, go and just browse podcasts, download them directly to it anywhere with this Wi-Fi.

1297
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:01,762
Scott: But they don't.

1298
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,640
Scott: Apple doesn't put the software on there to make it happen.

1299
01:13:05,022 --> 01:13:05,606
Scott: But they could.

1300
01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:06,936
Scott: And I don't know why they don't.

1301
01:13:07,581 --> 01:13:10,360
Rym: I mean, at least I don't think podcasting will go away.

1302
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:20,102
Rym: I think it's just going to be in a lull until technology gets better, because it's not like video can replace audio because you can't watch a video while you're driving or working.

1303
01:13:20,322 --> 01:13:32,219
Scott: I think this is going to be a gradual shift from all the current content distribution mechanisms like TV and terrestrial radio to just, you know, things are on the Internet and you can download them.

1304
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:38,740
Scott: And then there's just going to be, you know, there's going to be professionally made content on the Internet and none professionally made kind of on the Internet.

1305
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,980
Scott: It's all going to be just downloading video and audio from the Internet that people made.

1306
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,081
Guest: Yeah.

1307
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:47,280
Guest: And yeah, because I mean, I don't listen to morning radio.

1308
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,079
Guest: I can't really stand morning radio.

1309
01:13:49,481 --> 01:13:50,937
Rym: Hey, it's wacky morning, DJ.

1310
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:54,340
Rym: We're here to talk about the stuff we're stealing from far.

1311
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,560
Guest: But after I farted the microphone.

1312
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:58,004
Guest: There you go.

1313
01:13:58,024 --> 01:14:00,580
Guest: Yeah, I I don't know.

1314
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,324
Guest: I think that would help.

1315
01:14:01,365 --> 01:14:04,740
Guest: I think it would help as well if we could get, you know, decent Internet in America.

1316
01:14:05,061 --> 01:14:05,402
Guest: I know that.

1317
01:14:05,422 --> 01:14:10,982
Guest: Yeah, I know that, you know, in Europe and such, it's it's a whole lot better supposedly.

1318
01:14:11,002 --> 01:14:18,840
Guest: Yeah, because I think people have a problem with just waiting for the downloads as well, even though everybody has got high speed Internet.

1319
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:24,308
Rym: Yeah, but we get periodically emails from people saying, hey, could you make a dial up friendly version?

1320
01:14:24,429 --> 01:14:25,459
Rym: And I usually just laugh.

1321
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,160
Guest: So a MIDI file.

1322
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,558
Scott: Yeah, that's sort of like if you had like a.

1323
01:14:31,624 --> 01:14:32,660
Guest: You should release a MIDI file.

1324
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:37,419
Rym: That's going to be the next April Fools, because no one's going to remember this by then.

1325
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:46,660
Scott: That'd be like if you had a 286 and you sent like a letter to say, you know, Valve and you're like, hey, can you make a version of Half Life 2 that works on my 286?

1326
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,152
Guest: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1327
01:14:48,313 --> 01:14:48,918
Scott: Help me out here.

1328
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,258
Guest: Yeah, yeah, really.

1329
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,779
Scott: Port it to the Wolfenstein entry, then I could play it.

1330
01:14:56,261 --> 01:14:56,583
Rym: All right.

1331
01:14:56,864 --> 01:15:01,410
Rym: We I think we've we've gone through our allotment, so we'll probably end on that one.

1332
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:02,136
Scott: Let's end it here.

1333
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:03,839
Scott: I just want to make because.

1334
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:04,862
Scott: Right.

1335
01:15:05,504 --> 01:15:13,520
Scott: So just to end it, I wonder if Gerald has any like a message for the listeners, perhaps something you want to pimp besides Anime World Order or, you know, anything.

1336
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:23,978
Guest: Yeah, well, I guess the regular is, you know, check us out if you liked what you heard, because normally we're a whole lot more edited on Anime World Order out of www.animeworldorder.com.

1337
01:15:25,361 --> 01:15:27,340
Guest: Clarissa and Daryl, they write for Otaku USA.

1338
01:15:27,864 --> 01:15:28,898
Guest: So check that out, too.

1339
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:37,882
Guest: It's the most entertaining anime magazine out there because Peak is is not something else.

1340
01:15:39,108 --> 01:15:41,139
Scott: I haven't read the peak, so I don't know.

1341
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,784
Guest: Yeah.

1342
01:15:43,689 --> 01:15:45,660
Guest: Peak is because it's a magazine.

1343
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,659
Guest: I can definitely say it's printed on paper.

1344
01:15:49,482 --> 01:15:49,785
Guest: Yes.

1345
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:50,978
Guest: Sold in stores.

1346
01:15:52,903 --> 01:15:54,940
Guest: It's got a P and I and a Q in its name.

1347
01:15:55,061 --> 01:15:56,157
Guest: I can definitely say that.

1348
01:15:57,482 --> 01:15:59,460
Guest: Yeah, that's that's about all I've got to pimp, really.

1349
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:07,140
Rym: Well, I guess all I can say is that you guys keep doing Anime World Order because, I mean, it's the rare compliment from GeekNights.

1350
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:12,460
Rym: But you guys are one of the like five or six podcasts we actually listen to at all.

1351
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:13,339
Rym: And you guys are great.

1352
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:16,600
Scott: Well, non profession, I listen to some professional podcasts.

1353
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,428
Rym: Those don't count.

1354
01:16:17,468 --> 01:16:18,560
Rym: Those are those are separate.

1355
01:16:19,224 --> 01:16:19,327
Rym: Yeah.

1356
01:16:19,594 --> 01:16:19,799
Guest: Yeah.

1357
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:20,976
Guest: ESPN does not count.

1358
01:16:22,742 --> 01:16:24,500
Guest: We we like every one of our listeners.

1359
01:16:24,641 --> 01:16:26,271
Guest: So except that guy,

1360
01:16:26,572 --> 01:16:27,216
Rym: you know, the ones

1361
01:16:27,257 --> 01:16:27,760
Scott: not like us.

1362
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:28,658
Scott: We hate our listeners.

1363
01:16:31,582 --> 01:16:32,166
Rym: Well, what's his name?

1364
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:34,300
Rym: Admiral Beefy or whoever seems to hate us.

1365
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:34,605
Rym: Yeah.

1366
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:35,260
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1367
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,320
Scott: What was up with that guy who would like said that voicemail to you?

1368
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:41,739
Scott: That was like so seething about hating us.

1369
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,800
Guest: Oh, I don't remember that one.

1370
01:16:45,285 --> 01:16:46,139
Scott: It was really scary.

1371
01:16:47,564 --> 01:16:48,800
Guest: We get we get very.

1372
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:50,157
Rym: Oh, you guys get some fantastic.

1373
01:16:52,502 --> 01:16:56,719
Rym: I maybe because we don't play this stuff on the air, but we don't get the really weird ones like you guys do.

1374
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:07,080
Guest: Well, I guess our sort of podcast being as geeky as it is, it kind of breeds the especially geeky sort of people in a good way and in a bad way.

1375
01:17:07,761 --> 01:17:09,148
Rym: I guess, you know, you can't.

1376
01:17:09,349 --> 01:17:11,219
Rym: you can't have the rose without the thorns.

1377
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,262
Rym: You can't have the.

1378
01:17:12,282 --> 01:17:17,900
Rym: I don't know if that's the analogy to use with anime fans and video game fans.

1379
01:17:18,726 --> 01:17:19,820
Guest: And I think that that applies.

1380
01:17:20,081 --> 01:17:22,647
Guest: And yeah, I mean, we get.

1381
01:17:22,667 --> 01:17:27,659
Guest: I'd like to say that we have the the smartest listener base in anime podcasting.

1382
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:29,799
Rym: I think on average, I might have to agree.

1383
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:31,644
Guest: I do believe that.

1384
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:35,040
Guest: I think that our podcasts, our listeners are some of the smartest people in anime.

1385
01:17:35,923 --> 01:17:37,439
Guest: But we get crazies, too.

1386
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:40,040
Guest: And they're awesome because crazy people are awesome.

1387
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,002
Rym: Crazy people.

1388
01:17:41,062 --> 01:17:45,340
Rym: I mean, if you don't a guy is any example.

1389
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,480
Guest: Well, going to guys and crazy going a guy is a prophet.

1390
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:50,931
Guest: He's predicting the future.

1391
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,740
Scott: I was I was under the impression that, you know, to be a prophet, you must be crazy.

1392
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:57,060
Rym: I mean, you go hand in hand.

1393
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:07,940
Guest: You realize going a guy came before noted him before something before any like people said with Elvis, like before anybody did anything.

1394
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,540
Guest: Elvis did everything before anybody did anything.
