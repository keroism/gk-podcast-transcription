1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,758
Scott: It's Thursday, December 21st.

2
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,169
Scott: I'm Scott, and I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,690
Scott: Tonight we rummage through our forums and discuss random crap.

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,788
Scott: Let's do this!

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:30,178
Rym: So in the spirit of the holidays, coupled with the fact that we kind of realized periodically that we've got some money here, we're finally gonna buy new microphones.

6
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:30,720
Scott: Are we?

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,604
Scott: When are we gonna do this?

8
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,210
Rym: We were thinking about doing it tonight.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,474
Scott: Are we gonna do it tonight?

10
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:35,218
Rym: I don't know, maybe.

11
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,790
Scott: How many times have we said we're gonna do that and then not done it?

12
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,769
Rym: We're definitely gonna have these new microphones before Katsucon.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,917
Scott: I'm betting you won't notice that much of a difference.

14
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:45,341
Rym: No, you guys probably won't.

15
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:51,095
Scott: Yeah, but we're probably gonna get those SM57s that everyone else gets.

16
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:54,787
Rym: Yeah, it is the microphone of bass drums and presidents.

17
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:56,615
Scott: Not bass drums, but other drums.

18
00:00:56,977 --> 00:00:59,190
Scott: Bass drums get those big, other, those weird...

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,450
Rym: Well, actually a lot of people there, you can do something cool where you take what is effectively a subwoofer and use it as a microphone and stick it in front of a bass drum.

20
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,479
Rym: It works real well.

21
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:10,805
Scott: That could work real well.

22
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:11,790
Rym: It does work real well.

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,910
Rym: In fact, I saw some companies sell, apparently, they call them like bass microphones, but they're really just subwoofers.

24
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:19,010
Scott: Awesome.

25
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,239
Scott: Yeah, okay.

26
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,270
Scott: That's not so exciting.

27
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:33,698
Rym: Well, I mean we've been using... Now, I thought it was funny though that when we showed up at Sitacon way back, a lot of the other podcasters we met, I mean, they're cool people, but they had fairly expensive, a lot of mad condenser microphones.

28
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:51,261
Scott: Which are, I mean, sure, if you're doing something super fancy that's gonna, you know, sound better, I guess on some level, but when you turn during it into mp3 in the end, an mp3 that's mad, low quality, and shitty, that's a lot of extra money you're paying for not much more.

29
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:54,070
Rym: It wasn't just that because those microphones are okay.

30
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:02,725
Rym: It's more that condenser microphones used to be leaps and bounds better, but in recent years, dynamic microphones are pretty much just as good.

31
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:10,070
Rym: And in fact, in most applications you're better off using a high quality and cheaper dynamic microphone than you are using a condenser mic.

32
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:17,470
Scott: Yeah, I figured the SM57, they keep advertising the fact that the President of the United States, that's the microphone that's on the podium.

33
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:22,270
Scott: So, you know, and it is, and he sounds fine when he gives the State of the Union address.

34
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:24,990
Scott: So I think it's gonna be alright.

35
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:25,492
Scott: Well, not

36
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:35,682
Rym: only that, but we were looking around and pretty much numerous people have, when they, you know, if you run into them, people who know what they're talking about, always say, "Yeah, so what do you use, an

37
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:35,843
Rym: SM58?"

38
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,510
Rym: Which apparently is the industry standard, one of the most commonly used vocal microphones in the world.

39
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,783
Scott: Yeah, if you go to a concert and someone's singing, 90% chance it's an SM58.

40
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:53,625
Rym: It might be, they've just released very recently the newest, newest versions of the 57 and the 58.

41
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:53,709
Rym: Oh.

42
00:02:54,094 --> 00:02:55,269
Rym: But they're quite a bit more money.

43
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,930
Scott: Yeah, forget it, it doesn't matter as far as we're concerned.

44
00:02:58,154 --> 00:02:58,409
Scott: No, no.

45
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,548
Scott: We'll get the cheapest one.

46
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,210
Rym: Yeah, we'll probably get the 57.

47
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,590
Rym: I mean, the 58, from what I get, here's the thing- 57?

48
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,290
Scott: Oh, 58.

49
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,030
Scott: If I may, if you will, from what we can gather- Got made that very nice.

50
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:25,869
Rym: The difference between the two, and remember, this is subjective because no one really could give me a straight answer, is that the 57 is better for people talking and situations where you're not gonna, I don't know, throw the thing at a brick wall and then run it over with a car.

51
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:26,708
Scott: And drums.

52
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,090
Rym: Because the 58 is really, really durable.

53
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:38,590
Rym: There are stories of certain rock musicians swinging it around by the wire and banging it into things and then singing from it and it worked just fine.

54
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:46,270
Scott: Yeah, I think that seems to be the point of the 58, is for live vocals and beating the shit out of it and having it still work.

55
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,089
Scott: That seems to be the two things it's really good at.

56
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,990
Rym: So we should probably get those, you know, to fend people off at conventions.

57
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:53,289
Scott: Haha, lol.

58
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,830
Scott: Now, conventions, whenever I go to conventions, they seem to already have those there, already lined up, so.

59
00:03:58,096 --> 00:03:58,289
Scott: Yeah.

60
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,689
Scott: Hey, whatcha gonna do?

61
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,410
Rym: Plus, it's not like, I mean, we're pretty much at any con now, we're gonna set up somewhere, all our equipment, and not move it.

62
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:12,090
Rym: And we're not gonna carry around some little crap recordy bit that someone we know may or may not break when we lend it to them to-

63
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:19,548
Scott: We should really invest, like, just, who cares about the price, it's worth it to get one of those high quality, you know-

64
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:21,269
Rym: Solid state recorders?

65
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:21,829
Rym: Exactly.

66
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,070
Rym: Though for now, I mean, like, KatsuCon, there's a good chance we'll be just setting up in the, uh, video game room.

67
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,860
Scott: Yeah, that'll be fine.

68
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:33,610
Rym: But I mean, in the- Or like Otakon, we're just gonna set up at our table, I think, or in the hotel room or something.

69
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:40,830
Scott: But in the long run, it'll be worth it to spend, like, 400 bucks on one of those compact flash recorders with two XLR inputs and everything.

70
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:41,550
Rym: Oh, definitely.

71
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,810
Scott: I mean, especially after- Just bite the bullet and shell out the cash.

72
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,350
Rym: Yeah, though my primary concern now is updating the website.

73
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:47,861
Scott: Yeah.

74
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:54,850
Scott: Plus, those things are also useful for, you can record the show directly onto one of those, like, when we're sitting in this room.

75
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:59,650
Scott: And then we'll have a backup, you know, so if you delete it, you can just go and get it off the compact flash card.

76
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,790
Rym: Yep, like, I could just keep them, like, 'cause we could set up the mixer- We could even just record the show on it all the time.

77
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:11,010
Rym: Yeah, and some of them are fancy, and you just plug them also via USB or FireWire into a computer and just get the WAV files off.

78
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,470
Scott: Yeah, we can record the show without a computer and then just edit it on the computer.

79
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,520
Rym: Or we split it and record to both just in case the computer fucks up and- Yep, yep.

80
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:18,910
Scott: Alright.

81
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:25,470
Scott: Yeah, expect a bunch of bit-by-bit upgrades because we- Upgrades that you won't notice, they're only for us, hahaha.

82
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,770
Rym: Yeah, 'cause, well, GeekNights is doing well enough to where we've definitely passed the point of pod-fading.

83
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:42,430
Rym: I don't know of a podcast other than the professional paid ones that have done more episodes than us.

84
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:49,830
Scott: Wait, wait, wait, let's see, um, I know that that MTV guy has done more episodes than us 'cause he did 'em five days a week for a long time.

85
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,050
Scott: You know, he missed 'em here and there, but whatever.

86
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:57,429
Scott: Um, I'm pretty sure Comic Geek Speak has done more episodes than us, but- Oh yeah, they could've.

87
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,230
Scott: In numbered episodes, we've done more, but they have a lot of episodes they don't put numbers on.

88
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,789
Scott: They're just, like, extra episodes.

89
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:04,353
Rym: Ahh.

90
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,590
Scott: They have, like, episodes for Book of the Month or for other stuff that they don't put numbers on.

91
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:09,250
Rym: Yeah.

92
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:13,869
Rym: Well, we put a number on everything just so we can serialize things for, you know, the DVD and such.

93
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,430
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but, uh, yeah, I wonder, we might just become the podcast with the most episodes.

94
00:06:21,072 --> 00:06:23,029
Scott: Yeah, I mean- Maybe Onion Radio News.

95
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,904
Rym: Yeah, yeah, hahaha.

96
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,469
Rym: Maybe we count hours of content per week.

97
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,890
Scott: Yeah, there might be, uh, like, some daily podcast with, like, five-minute shows.

98
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,130
Scott: They might beat us out.

99
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:35,449
Scott: We gotta go find this out.

100
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,350
Scott: What podcast has the most episodes?

101
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:39,450
Scott: Didn't we look into this before?

102
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,269
Rym: And we couldn't find anyone bigger than us.

103
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,050
Scott: No, someone in the forums pointed to a few podcasts who had the most episodes.

104
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,770
Rym: Well, maybe we'll find that in our, uh, dickings about during the main bit today.

105
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,808
Scott: Maybe we will.

106
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,590
Rym: But anyway, to get to the news.

107
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:58,230
Rym: Now, this news does not affect anyone in the world except for this one guy and all the people reading about it.

108
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,069
Rym: And I chose- I wasn't even gonna talk about this.

109
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:03,630
Rym: I was just reading this news to tell Scott about it because I found it funny.

110
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:04,809
Scott: It was gonna be a thing of the day.

111
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:11,069
Rym: Yeah, but then I read the actual article and there are some choice quotes here.

112
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:24,930
Rym: Now, the story is, and the story has been repeated around the world lately, a fat dude, he weighs over three bucks, you know, like 350 pounds, and he wanted to fly on an airplane out of France.

113
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,349
Rym: Now, he was French.

114
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,248
Scott: How tall was the guy?

115
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,770
Rym: I doesn't say.

116
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,270
Scott: Okay, because I'm trying to get an idea of how wide he was, because these guys who weigh 350 that are pretty tall and not so wide.

117
00:07:34,772 --> 00:07:40,770
Scott: And there are guys who were like five foot six and they weigh 350, and they're like three plane seats wide.

118
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,489
Scott: So, you know, it's a tough call.

119
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:52,110
Rym: Well, the people involved, I mean, you know, the judge, it looks like the jury that may be sitting here, the lawyers, all seem to agree as to the stature of this man.

120
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:58,784
Rym: Now, you see, he tried to get on this plane and our friend said, "Oh, no, no, no.

121
00:07:58,804 --> 00:07:59,570
Rym: You are too large.

122
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,143
Rym: You need to buy two

123
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:01,607
Rym: tickets.".

124
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:02,850
Scott: No ticket.

125
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,489
Rym: No ticket.

126
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,128
Scott: No ticket.

127
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,190
Rym: So this man gets obviously indignant and he buys the extra ticket.

128
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,530
Rym: Now, he's suing for the humiliation that he suffered for having to buy an extra ticket.

129
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:24,030
Rym: Now, never mind the fact that Air France warns its passengers on the website before they get there, all over the place, that if you're large and you require two seats, you'll be forced to buy one, you won't be allowed to board.

130
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:25,709
Rym: It's been their policy forever.

131
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:27,090
Rym: They enforce it uniformly.

132
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:30,450
Rym: There's no question that this is a set thing.

133
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,849
Scott: I have a feeling they're going to win this lawsuit.

134
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,770
Scott: I just had this feeling.

135
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:35,563
Rym: I don't know what it is.

136
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,469
Rym: Better call Randy.

137
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,090
Scott: I know.

138
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:47,710
Rym: So they get to court and Fernand Gomalt, who is the lawyer for the airline, in part of his opening statement said the following.

139
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,910
Rym: This is an exact quote I assume translated from French.

140
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,670
Rym: "Let's be objective.

141
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:54,402
Rym: This man is fat.

142
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,250
Rym: He barely fits on the courtroom chair.

143
00:08:58,731 --> 00:08:59,924
Rym: How could he sit in an

144
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:00,470
Rym: airplane?".

145
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:04,010
Scott: "That has the best lawyer job in the world.

146
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,749
Scott: Make fun of fat guy.

147
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,960
Scott: Get lots of

148
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:07,305
Scott: money.".

149
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:20,670
Rym: Now the guy comes back to say that he feels humiliated, that he's been denounced as fat and enormous on quote unquote countless occasions during the hearing.

150
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,290
Scott: "Maybe you shouldn't have eaten so much food.

151
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:26,765
Scott: You did it to yourself, you fat

152
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:27,249
Scott: ass.".

153
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:30,390
Rym: I felt shocked and humiliated by what he said.

154
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:43,850
Rym: Now if he had called him say a fat fuck, or if he had said this man is a smelly fat obese person and he didn't actually smell, then he might have cause to be a little bit humiliated and shocked and angry.

155
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:49,330
Scott: I mean if he said the guy was a fag or something and the guy was, you know, then that's not cool.

156
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,630
Rym: But if I state an objective fact about a person I meet and that person becomes angry about it.

157
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,466
Scott: "Yeah, like Rym, you brown haired, brown long haired

158
00:09:58,587 --> 00:09:58,908
Scott: person.".

159
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:00,084
Rym: "Scott, you

160
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:00,410
Rym: Jew.".

161
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:06,388
Scott: "Oh no, he said I was a Jew and I kinda

162
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:06,509
Scott: am.".

163
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:06,994
Scott: "Oh

164
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:07,403
Scott: lordy.".

165
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:08,706
Scott: "What am I going to

166
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:08,849
Scott: do?".

167
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:11,202
Rym: "You better stop

168
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:11,465
Rym: that.".

169
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:12,097
Scott: "All

170
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:12,530
Scott: right.".

171
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:19,010
Rym: "But if you see a fat man and you say, 'Excuse me, fat man, I would like to walk past you.

172
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,820
Rym: Could you kindly step

173
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:20,246
Rym: aside?'

174
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:23,927
Rym: That person really has no right to be indignant about the fact that you've called him

175
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:24,268
Rym: fat.".

176
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:30,281
Rym: But the fact that this lawyer, and this is what I love about other countries, if this happened in the U.S.

177
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,270
Rym: there would have been a shitstorm.

178
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,130
Rym: I don't see any shitstorm in France.

179
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,450
Rym: I don't see any reaction.

180
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,510
Scott: I think it's because there's less fat people in France.

181
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,779
Scott: I mean I don't know where France is on the list of having the most fatness, but I'm pretty sure it's U.S.

182
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,508
Scott: followed by Britain or vice versa.

183
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,110
Rym: Yeah, I think Britain is number one.

184
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,060
Scott: Britain followed by

185
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,181
Scott: U.S.,

186
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:47,770
Scott: it doesn't matter.

187
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,710
Scott: People who speak English are fatter.

188
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,270
Rym: And Australia is catching up real quick, but no, France and Greece are really, really low.

189
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:58,430
Scott: Mediterranean people seem to eat good food and not be fat.

190
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,990
Rym: Because they drink nectar and they eat fruit.

191
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,010
Scott: Yeah, so they had really good fruits when I was in Israel.

192
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:03,929
Rym: I don't doubt it.

193
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:09,070
Scott: But no, so French people are less fat, so they have no problem making fun of fat people.

194
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:14,170
Rym: In America, the lawsuit, they probably would have still lost because the airlines win these lawsuits in America too.

195
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,572
Rym: But here in the

196
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:15,015
Rym: U.S.,

197
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:22,229
Rym: the lawsuit would have gone along the lines of the fat man saying that he's being discriminated against and that he was being humiliated and blah blah blah.

198
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,609
Rym: And the airline would say, no, it is simply our policy.

199
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:27,110
Rym: But in France, they say, let's be objective.

200
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:28,170
Rym: This man is fat.

201
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,769
Rym: He barely fits in the courtroom chair.

202
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:31,150
Rym: How can he fit on an airplane?

203
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:31,967
Rym: I rest my case.

204
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:33,068
Rym: Awesome.

205
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,569
Rym: And I imagine that the judge said, well, you sold me.

206
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,645
Scott: Yeah, the judges look at the guy and go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

207
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:52,190
Rym: Yes, that's how, let's see, we've already made fun of our Australian listeners and our our albionic listeners.

208
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:53,829
Scott: All right.

209
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,029
Rym: We've got to follow the anime world order thing and make fun of the Irish.

210
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:06,890
Rym: I would just like to ask, if we have any Irish listeners, give us a shout out.

211
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,430
Rym: We want to represent the Emerald Isle.

212
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:10,230
Scott: And I apologize.

213
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,590
Scott: Until recently, I was not able to tell you apart from the Scottish.

214
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,850
Rym: Luckily, Scott has learned.

215
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,410
Rym: We used to go through like wait years and years and years ago.

216
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:20,330
Rym: We do this thing where it's got to be like, so which one is winning?

217
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,548
Rym: I'd be like a Scottish.

218
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:23,490
Rym: You're like, which one is leprechaun?

219
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:24,550
Rym: That's the Irish.

220
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,490
Scott: I really didn't know.

221
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,530
Scott: I thought they were all the same.

222
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:35,690
Scott: I was like, yeah, I imagine like leprechauns playing golf by the Blarney Stone with some four leaf clovers in the Loch Ness Monster.

223
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:36,750
Scott: I didn't know.

224
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,707
Scott: I thought they were all the same.

225
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:39,990
Rym: Much like one time, one of the places I worked at.

226
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:46,749
Rym: I mean, a lot of people, especially in the US, don't actually seem to realize that Asian nations are kind of different from each other.

227
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:53,350
Rym: So it's the same thing where a Korean was hired where I work and he was a cool guy.

228
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:59,928
Rym: But when they were interviewing him, they asked me if they wanted me to come in and talk to him a little bit.

229
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,129
Rym: And I was like, why?

230
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,150
Rym: What do I have to do with this guy?

231
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,329
Rym: And they're like, well, you like all that Japanese stuff.

232
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:11,270
Rym: And I'm like, yeah, Japanese, not Korean.

233
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,220
Scott: Yep.

234
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,329
Rym: What else I can say about that?

235
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,349
Scott: Not the same.

236
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:17,809
Rym: So then you have some sort of news.

237
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,137
Scott: I do.

238
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:25,450
Scott: There was a big rumor going around the Internet, like OMG, on Christmas, Nintendo is going to give people free virtual console games.

239
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:26,189
Rym: Is that rumor true?

240
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:26,828
Scott: No.

241
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,109
Scott: Nintendo is like, screw you guys.

242
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:30,630
Scott: Virtual console games cost money.

243
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:42,509
Rym: But if I were a Nintendo, I would put Super Mario Brothers one, the original game in the virtual console for free without saying a word on Christmas Day.

244
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,470
Scott: Well, that was part of the rumor.

245
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:51,330
Rym: No, I mean, that's what I would do if I were in charge of that division of Nintendo, because that wouldn't even preclude selling Mario one in the future.

246
00:13:51,910 --> 00:14:01,650
Rym: You only you give it away for free and then later you sell the Super Mario pack or you sell Super Mario one plus.

247
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,550
Scott: Well, apparently Nintendo is not doing any of that.

248
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,210
Scott: All the virtual console games cost money.

249
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,989
Scott: But however, here is the list of what is going to be available on the virtual console Christmas morning.

250
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,890
Scott: Super Mario Brothers one for five hundred points.

251
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,609
Rym: You know, that's almost worth it.

252
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,549
Rym: That's such a good game.

253
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:18,449
Scott: Yeah, I know.

254
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,450
Scott: But I already have the game for Game Boy Color.

255
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:21,300
Rym: Yeah.

256
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,861
Rym: Yeah.

257
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:23,390
Rym: I have the game on numerous things.

258
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,108
Scott: Which is probably the best version of it, too.

259
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:33,170
Scott: Street Fighter two, the World Warrior, I assume is just going to be like a very good version of Street Fighter two for eight hundred points.

260
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,690
Rym: I'm not familiar with that version of Street Fighter two.

261
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,870
Scott: It's probably going to be a lot like Street Fighter two turbo because it's a Super NES game.

262
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,488
Rym: But if that's the case, I wouldn't be that averse to it.

263
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:42,930
Scott: Yeah.

264
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:57,649
Scott: Super Castlevania, which I must say that if you're looking for the old school Castlevania, not the new school Symphony the Night Game Boy DS style where you get items and stuff, but the old school style where it's mostly whipping and platforming.

265
00:14:58,212 --> 00:14:59,926
Scott: This is the best one as a game.

266
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:01,006
Scott: I don't know.

267
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,649
Scott: It introduced the dangly whip.

268
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,019
Scott: It did.

269
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:04,088
Scott: The dangly whip.

270
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,550
Rym: The dangly whip, which has survived to this day in the newest Castlevania for the DS.

271
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:13,357
Scott: In old Castlevania's, if you whipped, you basically the whip came out and the whip went away.

272
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:13,928
Scott: and that was it.

273
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:21,630
Scott: This is the first Castlevania where you could hold the whip out and just kind of jiggle it and swing it around and not stop swinging it around.

274
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,989
Scott: You could swing it in a circle.

275
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,309
Scott: You could kind of shake it back and forth.

276
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:25,850
Rym: Yeah.

277
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:35,430
Scott: Just kind of lower it over the edge of a rock and just kind of put it on the skeletons head below you and jiggle it back and forth and the skeleton would slowly die.

278
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:43,110
Rym: Granted, it's got nothing on Castlevania 2 where one of the items you could get if you did some crazy stuff was a giant diamond that you could throw.

279
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,370
Rym: It would just bounce all around the screen, killing everything.

280
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,570
Scott: But Super Castlevania is excellent.

281
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,090
Scott: Toe Jam and Earl.

282
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,708
Scott: Do you remember this?

283
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:51,189
Rym: I remember Toe Jam and Earl.

284
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,589
Scott: Toe Jam and Earl for the Sega Genesis is going to be out.

285
00:15:54,450 --> 00:16:02,869
Scott: And R-Type for the TurboGrafx-16, which is perhaps that is the... I already have R-Type for the Game Boy Color also and R-Type too.

286
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,786
Scott: But R-Type for the TurboGrafx-16...

287
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:06,404
Rym: For the SNES.

288
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,850
Scott: It's exactly the same.

289
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,930
Scott: It's R-Type 1, not R-Type 3 or whatever it was.

290
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:15,990
Scott: R-Type 1 for the TurboGrafx-16 was pretty much the best incarnation of R-Type ever.

291
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,289
Scott: And that is a classic shooter.

292
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,149
Scott: So basically on Christmas Day, they're bringing out the big guns.

293
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,849
Scott: Not the biggest guns, but pretty big ones.

294
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,270
Scott: Then on New Year's Day, they're going to shaft us.

295
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,410
Scott: They're going to give us baseball and urban champion.

296
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:34,270
Rym: You know, as much as I like to talk about urban champions, it wasn't a good game.

297
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:35,910
Scott: No, urban champion is not a good game.

298
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,950
Scott: I mean, it's a nostalgic game.

299
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:39,189
Scott: It has that kind of value.

300
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:42,330
Scott: But to play it, maybe five minutes of entertainment.

301
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:47,750
Rym: Yeah, there aren't many games that old that hold any sort of non-nostalgic value.

302
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,790
Scott: Yeah, and baseball in its day was excellent.

303
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:53,308
Scott: But as soon as games like Bases Loaded existed...

304
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,530
Rym: Or Baseball Simulator.

305
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,950
Scott: Or Baseball Simulator that had actual fielding that wasn't crap, baseball was useless.

306
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,124
Scott: I mean, it also has some fun nostalgia to it, but...

307
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,490
Rym: Of the early sports games, other than that one football game and Ice Hockey.

308
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,109
Scott: 10 Yard Fight.

309
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,549
Rym: 10 Yard Fight and Ice Hockey.

310
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,589
Rym: None of them really have much longevity.

311
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,770
Scott: Well, the tennis game could have been good, but the controls are just so shitty.

312
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,935
Rym: Well, yeah, but I mean, plus.

313
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:18,627
Rym: then Mario Tennis for the N64 came out.

314
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,589
Rym: Thereby defining in my mind the genre of tennis.

315
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:22,790
Scott: Have you ever played Virtua Tennis?

316
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,387
Rym: Actually, yes I have.

317
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:28,069
Scott: Virtua Tennis is actually... Virtua Tennis is the real tennis game.

318
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:29,710
Rym: Yeah, but I prefer Mario Tennis.

319
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,110
Scott: I also prefer Mario Tennis, but Virtua Tennis.

320
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:35,870
Rym: Of course, I always will have the special place in my heart for Ice Hockey.

321
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:41,131
Rym: Namely because earlier today, I beat Scott 19 to 7.

322
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:43,290
Scott: Well, you know, you figured out something.

323
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,390
Scott: Because a few days ago, we were pretty much even.

324
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,629
Scott: And then suddenly, you learned something new.

325
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,450
Rym: Well, see, what happened was we got Ice Hockey in the Virtual Console.

326
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,610
Rym: We played it twice, when just the two of us were in the house.

327
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:58,089
Rym: And both times, Scott won by one point.

328
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:05,310
Rym: Then, Alex came over, who did not play Ice Hockey for the previous decade and a half of his life.

329
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:09,502
Rym: So, I jokingly, while I went to get my laundry, said, "Hey, why don't you two play Ice

330
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:09,866
Rym: Hockey?".

331
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:16,343
Rym: By the time I got back from picking up my laundry, it was halfway through the first period, and Scott was already up by like 12 or 13 to zero.

332
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,449
Scott: It was like, it was a lot.

333
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,910
Scott: I basically got the puck score, got the puck score.

334
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:25,627
Rym: So, I sit down, I just pick up Alex's guy, and I'm like, "All right, Alex, I'll show you how to do

335
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:25,708
Rym: it.".

336
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,150
Rym: And I proceed to thwomp Scott into the ground.

337
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:34,610
Rym: From that moment forward, I won every game by at least a couple of goals, if not a fiery hellstorm.

338
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,784
Scott: Yeah, I think you figured something out.

339
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:40,170
Scott: that's not good, and I got to figure out, I'll make a comeback soon enough.

340
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:50,830
Rym: Well, considering that during today's game, you discovered when I told you that while you're doing the face-off, you can use the D-pad to tell which guy to pass the puck to.

341
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:51,708
Scott: I didn't know that.

342
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:57,826
Scott: I had always just kind of pushed A and hoped to win the face-off, and sometimes, you know, the puck went, and sometimes didn't go.

343
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:01,370
Scott: So, I thought it was just sort of a random thing.

344
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:01,830
Scott: Yeah.

345
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:02,867
Scott: All righty then.

346
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,490
Scott: Things of the day!

347
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:12,789
Scott: Oh, wow, right, things of the day, shit.

348
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,329
Rym: Yeah, you almost forgot, didn't you?

349
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:15,749
Scott: Almost did forget, yep.

350
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:27,230
Rym: Right, so Star Wars, episode four, five, and six, I won't deign to credit episodes one, two, and three in this, are together a great set of films, but what could make them greater?

351
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:34,409
Rym: Perhaps if you made them silent films, in the old silent film style.

352
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,070
Scott: Yeah, some of the voice acting in them was pretty bad.

353
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:39,769
Rym: I prefer the sub.

354
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,870
Scott: Yeah, lol, okay.

355
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:56,849
Rym: All right, so very simply, someone took Star Wars, episodes four, five, and six, and did various magical video trickery to them to make them look exactly like those old silent films, and they did a really freaking good job.

356
00:19:57,193 --> 00:20:18,390
Scott: Basically, they made it black and white, they put, you know, the old film grain on it, they put the funny, you know, you know how they had just the words, that is just the screen with text on it right before the video, and then they played some funny, old-timey, you know, silent film music, and they cut clips from the movie that match that music, it's pretty hilarious.

357
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:29,469
Rym: Not only that, but they even went so far as to give it that old-timey movie look where the film like sped up and slowed down a little bit while they were recording it, so all the action is quick and kind of jerky.

358
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:31,450
Scott: It's pretty awesome.

359
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,990
Rym: It's really, really well done.

360
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:41,309
Rym: And the thing is, if you've seen Star Wars, or pretty much if you listen to GeekNights, you pretty much will get the entire story of Star Wars from this thing.

361
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:48,169
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you'll even, if you've seen it enough, you'll know what words people are saying in certain parts, and you'll laugh.

362
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,005
Rym: It goes from, "Where is the

363
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:50,590
Rym: ambassador?"

364
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:51,890
Rym: to Ewoks dancing.

365
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:59,570
Scott: Not that shitty special edition music.

366
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,250
Rym: I can't believe, it's one thing to have something, I'm not gonna start on my right.

367
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,229
Scott: Not gonna start that, all right.

368
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,930
Scott: So, my thing today is pretty awesome.

369
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:13,770
Scott: There is a company that has existed for a very long time called Oriental Trading Incorporated.

370
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,730
Scott: This you might know because they might send a catalog to your house every once in a while.

371
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,909
Scott: They used to send one to my mom every once in a while.

372
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:27,029
Scott: Their catalog contains many, many things that are cheap, very, very cheap.

373
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:38,047
Scott: You ever go to an arcade, and there'll be all those prizes that are like one ticket or five tickets, like a plastic frog, or a bouncy ball, or shit like that.

374
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,030
Scott: Oriental Trading Company sells that shit in bulk.

375
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,050
Scott: Like for five bucks, they'll sell you like a sack of Superballs.

376
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:46,469
Scott: Huh.

377
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:51,930
Scott: Yeah, they sell a lot of random, cheap, little kids goodie bag shit.

378
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:54,389
Rym: I think we've figured out our swag.

379
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:55,722
Scott: Lol.

380
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,930
Scott: Okay, so one thing they were selling was a pinata.

381
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:02,909
Scott: Why not sell a pinata?

382
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:04,070
Rym: All right, all right.

383
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,730
Rym: I mean, nothing burns like an effigy, and pinatas are one of my favorite things in the world.

384
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,748
Scott: This pinata was filled with, you know, the cheap crap that they like to sell.

385
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:18,850
Scott: However, this pinata was a pinata shaped like a Humvee with little pictures of US soldiers.

386
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,694
Scott: So you- Oh.

387
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:21,518
Scott: Yeah.

388
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:22,232
Scott: Oh.

389
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:26,170
Scott: Not so tasteful, but manufactured in the Orient.

390
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,709
Scott: Somewhere where people didn't like US soldiers, I guess.

391
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:34,386
Rym: Or maybe they didn't even think of that.

392
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:39,429
Scott: I guess they just- Someone made a cheap pinata, and they just put it in their little catalog.

393
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,650
Scott: But the product is no longer available.

394
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:49,170
Scott: You can no longer purchase the army vehicle pinata for $16 from Oriental Trading.

395
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:50,929
Rym: Uh, I'm kind of disappointed.

396
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:56,569
Rym: It's kind of like when Walmart was selling those neo-Nazi things, and everyone went out to buy them as a joke.

397
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,689
Scott: But you can still get assorted color plastic frogs for eight bucks.

398
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,689
Rym: How many do you get for eight bucks?

399
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:06,457
Rym: Uh,

400
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:08,855
Rym: 144. 144

401
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,149
Rym: frogs for eight bucks.

402
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:12,309
Rym: That's a pretty damn good deal.

403
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:12,799
Scott: Yeah.

404
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:17,449
Rym: I mean, it's not as good as 100 tacos for $100, but it's right up there.

405
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:21,209
Scott: If you want useless pieces of plastic, Oriental Trading is where it's at.

406
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,770
Scott: And if you want US soldiers in a Humvee pinatas, if you've got one, awesome.

407
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,910
Rym: You might want to look on eBay.

408
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:30,130
Scott: You might want to look on eBay.

409
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,070
Scott: It could be a collector's item.

410
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:32,470
Scott: Okay.

411
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:33,170
Rym: All right.

412
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,910
Rym: So today, as a show, we realized that we haven't been doing a lot of GeekBacks lately.

413
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:39,248
Rym: And I'll tell you this.

414
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:43,810
Rym: There were actually two GeekBacks we were going to do this week that were topical and good.

415
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,048
Rym: Some emails people sent us.

416
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,448
Rym: Forgot to do them.

417
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,568
Rym: Gonna do them next week.

418
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:55,650
Rym: So to hold you over and also to promote our forums, because the GeekNights forums, the front row crew forums are pretty freaking rocking.

419
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,869
Rym: I mean, compared to all the other podcasts we know, GeekNights has one hell of a community behind it.

420
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,114
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:10,850
Scott: Let's first say that if you listen to this show, which you must listen to the show, because you're hearing what I'm saying, you should know that we have a forum.

422
00:24:11,531 --> 00:24:15,429
Scott: You go to a website and you can discuss things and threads and such.

423
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:21,863
Rym: And our listeners have had some interesting debates over the last 250 or so episodes of GeekNights.

424
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:37,730
Scott: There are many fun things being said and heard in our forums, and you can join them by going to frontrowcrew.com/forum and you apply for membership, then we approve your membership, and then you can post away.

425
00:24:38,491 --> 00:24:44,729
Rym: And if you weren't aware, our forums are very special compared to the rest of the teeming masses of internet heathens.

426
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,050
Rym: You see, we only have one moderator now.

427
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,647
Rym: We're still slowly in the process of getting more moderators, but our wonderful moderator, Mr.

428
00:24:51,667 --> 00:25:01,270
Rym: Period, his job is not only to moderate the forums, but to most importantly, correct the spelling and grammar of anyone who posts.

429
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:06,629
Rym: If you post in our forums with poor grammar or spelling, it will be corrected in red.

430
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:09,770
Rym: If you continue to do so, you will be banned.

431
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:12,750
Rym: As a result, there are no idiots in our forums.

432
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:15,090
Rym: There are no stupid kids in our forums.

433
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:17,449
Rym: There are only awesome people and punk kids.

434
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:18,849
Scott: Yep, that's about it.

435
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,209
Scott: And all of them know how to spell.

436
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:23,010
Scott: At least enough.

437
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,468
Rym: The few problems we've-- And we've only banned one person ever, and we've banned him twice.

438
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:29,258
Scott: Yeah.

439
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,169
Rym: All right.

440
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:47,768
Rym: So we thought to promote the forums a little bit, and to entertain all of you, and to take advantage of all the content that our listeners have generated for us over this year and a half, we're just going to go through the forums and respond or generally bring up everything that's come up in these forums.

441
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:49,430
Rym: Not everything.

442
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,350
Rym: Maybe five percent of the things that have come up.

443
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:52,949
Scott: Not even.

444
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:02,490
Rym: Five percent of the things that have come up that are not directly related to or already on the show, or in threads that are directly related to episodes of the show.

445
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:09,530
Scott: Yeah, we're not going to discuss any, because we have threads that are attached to shows, like this is a thread about this particular episode of GeekNights.

446
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:15,470
Rym: That's when people bring up such things as, "Wow, Raim, you were totally wrong about X," or "Wow, Scott, you were totally wrong about

447
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:15,510
Rym: X.".

448
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,429
Scott: Yeah, we're not going to discuss anything in those threads.

449
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,310
Scott: We're only discussing stuff in threads that have topics unrelated to shows that we've done.

450
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:34,567
Rym: Yes, and also we're not going to bother with some of the biggest and most awesome threads, but there have been some quite epic debates about copyright, religion, politics, religion, religion.

451
00:26:37,115 --> 00:26:38,209
Rym: There are some really...

452
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:38,948
Scott: Video games.

453
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:39,806
Rym: Religion.

454
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:41,327
Rym: Xenosaga.

455
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:42,530
Scott: Xenosaga.

456
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,790
Rym: There are some really good... I mean, actual good debates.

457
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,670
Rym: If you don't think there's debate left on the internet, check out our forums and search for anything controversial.

458
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,344
Scott: Well, the good debate on the internet is oxymoron.

459
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:57,190
Scott: It's like honest lawyer, honest politician, et cetera, et cetera.

460
00:26:58,273 --> 00:26:58,889
Rym: Good podcast.

461
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,049
Scott: Good podcast.

462
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:04,370
Rym: Right, so I guess you can start.

463
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:08,109
Rym: We both kind of picked out threads we wanted to bring up or bring some attention to.

464
00:27:08,732 --> 00:27:15,850
Scott: Well, the first thread I want to bring attention to, because I wrote a giant freaking post in it, is the first person shooter's thread.

465
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:32,850
Scott: Basically, we were discussing how Halo is no good because it's just Goldeneye with better graphics and vehicles and how the only people who play Halo or people who didn't play real FPSs on the PC, like Counter-Strike, or people who are no good at those FPSs, et cetera, et cetera.

466
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:39,978
Scott: And, you know, some guy... Water is Poison was like, "All right, what do you think were the groundbreaking FPSs and for what

467
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:40,404
Scott: reasons?".

468
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:50,270
Scott: So I made a list of every FPS that I thought was groundbreaking from Wolfenstein 3D up to Half-Life 2.

469
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,090
Rym: Now, while Scott was doing that, I was simultaneously writing my own rant.

470
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,149
Scott: Yeah, it took two posts.

471
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,090
Scott: That's how big this thing was that I wrote.

472
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:04,810
Scott: And I basically put down every single first person shooter I think was worth a shit and what I know about it and why.

473
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:08,689
Scott: And then it was pretty long, so you should all go read it.

474
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:13,390
Rym: Yeah, especially our dear friend Conrad out there, even though happy birthday, Conrad.

475
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:14,970
Rym: His birthday was recently.

476
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:29,027
Rym: But he tried to argue with us during one of the front row crew parties, actually the Macross party up in the Northern Geek House, that Halo was a pretty good game and that there's nothing special about using the keyboard and mouse to play an FPS.

477
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:34,590
Rym: And I highly recommend that he read that thread because it's not just us talking.

478
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:37,269
Rym: We actually cite some expert opinions there.

479
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:44,925
Scott: Yeah, well, it's definitely true that a lot of people say, "Oh, you're just not used to the

480
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:45,449
Scott: gamepad.".

481
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:50,409
Scott: Well, that's bullshit because I use gamepads for plenty of games.

482
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,490
Scott: I've been using gamepads longer than I've been using mouse and keyboards.

483
00:28:53,630 --> 00:29:03,130
Rym: Our friend Scott Johnson, who I think one of the driving philosophies in his life is to get the maximum amount of entertainment out of video games and DVDs for the least amount of money.

484
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,130
Rym: And this man is a legend.

485
00:29:06,594 --> 00:29:15,152
Rym: No matter what con we go to, no matter how good a deal I think I got on all the box sets I found for like a dollar from some homeless guy in the street, he'll

486
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:15,900
Scott: always come

487
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,450
Rym: back at the end of the day with three times as many DVDs as any of us for at least half the money.

488
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,649
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

489
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,450
Rym: And he does the same thing with video games.

490
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,910
Rym: He has like every GameCube game.

491
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:36,970
Rym: But he plays all those console FPSs and even he seems to at least realize that computer FPSs with a keyboard and mouse are infinitely better.

492
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:51,150
Scott: Yes, I've never met anyone who argues in favor of the console FPS without a mouse and keyboard with a gamepad who has actually played significant PC FPSs with mice and keyboards.

493
00:29:51,310 --> 00:30:03,730
Rym: Pretty much if you played at least a half of the list of games that we listed, you know, Doom, Quake 2 and all the mods, Half-Life mods, all those things, then you probably are able to make a judgment.

494
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:07,089
Scott: And you'll probably say mouse and keyboard on a PC.

495
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:16,630
Rym: Yeah, now of course we're not, I mean console FPSs do have their benefits in that you're all sitting in the same room and there's that LAN party camaraderie without the trouble of a LAN party.

496
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:26,729
Rym: But I've been to LAN parties and LAN parties, if you think you like FPSs, if you go to an actual LAN party and play FPSs there, it'll blow your goddamn mind.

497
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,189
Rym: Oh good God, the fun I've had at LAN parties back in high school.

498
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:32,630
Rym: Before I had a LAN.

499
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,170
Scott: I'm hoping that fun comes back as Portal and Team Fortress 2 come out.

500
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:38,790
Rym: Oh, Team Fortress 2.

501
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,290
Rym: I have such a hard-on for the game.

502
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:53,645
Rym: But anyway, there was a really cool thread a while ago, started by Scott Johnson, actually comes up again, or Kremlien in the forums, about your Dungeons & Dragons scores if you were a character in D&D.

503
00:30:54,611 --> 00:31:12,209
Rym: But not in terms of taking one of those stupid quizzes online or anything, but he basically asked everyone to sit down, think about what those scores mean, and as objectively and rationally as you can, come up with and defend what your ability scores are in the real world.

504
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:25,949
Rym: And it was surprisingly, everyone who posted, posted a very well thought out, very, in most cases, humble, or at least realistic assessment of how smart and pretty and strong and fast they are.

505
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:35,250
Scott: Yeah, I think the only problem with that is, you know, in the D&D world, like, it's real tough to compare those numbers to the actual real world.

506
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:42,230
Rym: Not really, I mean, like, for strength, it's very clear how much can you lift over your head, and there's a direct correlation.

507
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:50,744
Scott: The problem is we are all not, we don't have any class levels in any PC class, so in the D&D world, we really should all just have 10s and 11s and stuff.

508
00:31:51,752 --> 00:31:54,250
Rym: No, we have high ability scores, we just don't have class levels.

509
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,465
Rym: A peasant can have an 18 strength.

510
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,150
Scott: Not often, it's super rare.

511
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:00,810
Scott: And an 18 strength is like freaking Zangief.

512
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:09,769
Rym: Plus remember, because the basic ability scores range from three to 18, and the way probability rolls, they end up being effectively a bell curve.

513
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:25,070
Rym: So as a result, all you have to do is try to compare yourself and your ability in a given attribute to the average human being, and then try to figure out what percentile you're in, and from that you can come up with a very hard number as to your ability score.

514
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,828
Scott: If you assume the D&D scale is perfect.

515
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,110
Rym: Well no, it's not.

516
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:31,510
Rym: We use the D&D scale.

517
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:40,669
Scott: Yeah, the only other problem with the D&D scale is that basically two numbers are identical, like for all intents and purposes, 12 and 13 are the same.

518
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:47,010
Rym: Well, not if you ignore the ability bonuses and you go by second ed, or you go by the bell curve idea.

519
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:53,269
Scott: If we could have done second ed, it would actually have been a lot easier, because second ed has more information to determine those things.

520
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,190
Rym: Well, most of our friends don't have second ed books.

521
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,125
Scott: I know, neither do I.

522
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,690
Rym: See, it surprises me that I played second ed more.

523
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:02,569
Rym: I've still played more second ed D&D than I have played third ed D&D.

524
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,469
Scott: I played second ed D&D, just not much of it.

525
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,790
Rym: I played a lot of it.

526
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,190
Scott: Like two portions of two different campaigns.

527
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,770
Rym: Dude, I played regular D&D before I decided to switch to advanced Dungeons & Dragons.

528
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,150
Scott: I never actually played regular D&D ever.

529
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:21,970
Rym: But I think the thread was pretty cool, and everyone did a really good job of within the constraints of this argument, assessing themselves.

530
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,849
Rym: I thought it was a neat thread.

531
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,649
Rym: I'm not going to go through and read everyone's ability scores, because that would take forever.

532
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,609
Scott: That's a good point.

533
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,330
Scott: All right, check this thread.

534
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,410
Scott: This thread was called Eggnog question mark, started by Rym.

535
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:36,109
Rym: Oh yes, I remember this thread.

536
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,010
Scott: So Rym says, "So does anyone out there actually like Eggnog?

537
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:48,422
Scott: Maybe I've just never had good nog, but I find this stuff vile, and it's made me queasy every time I've tried it, alcohol or

538
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:48,608
Scott: no.".

539
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:53,508
Scott: Well, personally, I've never had Eggnog, because I know that's no good.

540
00:33:54,052 --> 00:33:54,215
Rym: Really?

541
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:54,990
Rym: You've never had Eggnog?

542
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,330
Scott: Well, I know it's no good.

543
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:56,990
Scott: Why should I even bother?

544
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,570
Rym: You know, actually, I'll say this.

545
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,789
Rym: Knowing your tastes, I mean, you can make non-alcoholic Eggnog.

546
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:05,190
Rym: I think you would like Eggnog.

547
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,008
Scott: Probably not, no.

548
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:07,550
Rym: I really think you would.

549
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,788
Rym: I know what kind of shit you like.

550
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:09,909
Scott: You're crazy.

551
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,748
Scott: You always think you know what shit I like, and then you don't know.

552
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,090
Rym: Well, it's pretty easy.

553
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,129
Rym: You don't like much shit.

554
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:16,129
Scott: What are you talking about?

555
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:16,808
Scott: You don't like shit.

556
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:22,068
Rym: You complain about that you can't drink anything carbonated, or with fructose corn syrup in it.

557
00:34:23,714 --> 00:34:25,270
Scott: Is it water juice or milk?

558
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:26,009
Scott: No, it's not.

559
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,007
Scott: So I'm not going to drink it.

560
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,289
Rym: Eggnog is mostly milk and egg.

561
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:29,775
Rym: Egg?

562
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:30,868
Rym: You'll eat egg.

563
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,007
Scott: But it's like raw egg.

564
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:32,699
Rym: Yeah.

565
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:33,132
Scott: Ew.

566
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:35,290
Scott: Raw eggs, great.

567
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,208
Scott: No, it's terrible.

568
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,469
Rym: I've eaten raw eggs.

569
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:41,389
Scott: When I eat eggs, I want them as non-liquid as possible.

570
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,429
Rym: God, when you eat eggs, you eat McDonald's egg.

571
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:45,370
Rym: I'm going to enlighten our listeners here.

572
00:34:45,935 --> 00:34:46,850
Rym: I hate to make fun of Scott.

573
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,070
Rym: I know you all think that I'm mean to Scott.

574
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,248
Scott: There's nothing wrong with my eggs.

575
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:56,010
Rym: You all think I'm mean to Scott, but for anyone who is a member of the front row crew, they can tell you that, in fact, it is the opposite.

576
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:57,147
Scott: You suck.

577
00:34:58,376 --> 00:34:59,169
Rym: I got to bring this up.

578
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:05,050
Rym: The way Scott cooks eggs is he takes a bunch of eggs and cracks them into some sort of container.

579
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,330
Rym: He then whips them, doesn't add water or salt or milk or anything to them.

580
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:12,929
Rym: He takes a hot pan.

581
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:14,789
Rym: He dumps the egg into the pan.

582
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:16,750
Rym: He waits until it's a solid mass.

583
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:17,848
Rym: He dumps it out.

584
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:19,568
Scott: I put salt on it and then I eat it.

585
00:35:19,972 --> 00:35:20,929
Rym: Yeah, after you've cooked it.

586
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,190
Scott: Sometimes if I have some salami.

587
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,389
Rym: That's how McDonald's makes its eggs.

588
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,770
Scott: I'll put salami in the egg while it's in the pan to make salami and eggs.

589
00:35:30,276 --> 00:35:31,230
Rym: You don't know how to make eggs.

590
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,130
Rym: Your eggs are disgusting.

591
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,309
Scott: You don't know how to make eggs.

592
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:34,487
Rym: You know what?

593
00:35:34,951 --> 00:35:38,003
Rym: Everyone who comes over when I make them eggs says, "Wow, Rym, those are really good

594
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:38,327
Rym: eggs.".

595
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:39,070
Scott: Whatever.

596
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,190
Scott: They just don't know what that is.

597
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:40,849
Rym: All right, tell you what.

598
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,550
Rym: At the New Year's party, you make a McDonald's egg.

599
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:44,889
Scott: It's not a McDonald's egg.

600
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:46,128
Rym: I'll make a real egg.

601
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,250
Rym: We'll blindfold some people and have them try both and we'll see what they say.

602
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,010
Scott: I like my egg.

603
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,210
Scott: I don't like eggs to be wet.

604
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,889
Scott: They got to be dry.

605
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,607
Rym: My eggs are wet.

606
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:55,570
Scott: Yeah, they are.

607
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,190
Rym: No, they're not.

608
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:58,049
Rym: They're not wet.

609
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,566
Rym: They're as wet as an egg is.

610
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:01,809
Scott: Eggs are really, really wet.

611
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:04,850
Scott: I like eggs to be solid and dry.

612
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,430
Rym: You like eggs to be a uniform dense mass of yellow matter.

613
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,210
Scott: That's what tastes good.

614
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:11,010
Scott: That's terrible.

615
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,670
Scott: It's awesome.

616
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,989
Rym: You don't even make scrambled eggs.

617
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,469
Rym: You just make a massive egg.

618
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,589
Scott: That's what I want is a massive egg.

619
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:20,910
Rym: All right, to continue with the threads here of Eggnog.

620
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:30,249
Rym: There was a thread about bathing and showering, which is kind of related to an episode we did, but there was an interesting comment from Ugly Fred, who has visited our house on several occasions.

621
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:37,410
Rym: I would contend that the shower in your house is one of those tap the top of the dial and get 10 degrees hotter showers.

622
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:50,070
Rym: Every time I come over, I have to spend like five minutes adjusting the fucking thing until it's just right because the threshold between uncomfortably cold and all caps burning your skin off hot is about an eighth of an inch of turning.

623
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,529
Scott: I don't really have a problem with that.

624
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,909
Rym: That's because we're used to it.

625
00:36:53,352 --> 00:36:59,066
Scott: It could be because we're used to it, but I think it's also because burning your skin off hot is the temperature I set it in.

626
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,250
Rym: I will note that Scott takes showers so hot.

627
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,063
Scott: Is this just going to be the show of?

628
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:08,987
Scott: go through the forum and every single thread talk about how Scott thinks about it?

629
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:10,629
Rym: That was my plan.

630
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,140
Rym: Great.

631
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,249
Rym: This one's not really making fun of you though.

632
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:14,909
Rym: I wasn't going to make fun of you.

633
00:37:15,912 --> 00:37:26,508
Rym: I was just going to note that Scott takes showers so hot that if I tried to take a shower after him, as opposed to before him, I can barely breathe from the level of steam that is condensed into that room.

634
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:29,510
Scott: We don't have a sauna, so why not?

635
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:30,669
Rym: Why don't we get a sauna?

636
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,130
Scott: Because we have a shower.

637
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:32,989
Scott: What do we need a sauna for?

638
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,189
Rym: Saunas are a lot nicer because you can sit in a sauna.

639
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:37,509
Rym: Actually, my grandpa had a sauna.

640
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:44,810
Rym: That was basically a thing that would boil the water and make steam and then a tent that you sat in and the tent went up and covered your whole body.

641
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,702
Rym: You could sit in a chair in.

642
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,328
Rym: it really comfy and it was a nice chair in there.

643
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:50,928
Rym: But the top had a hole for the neck that sealed around the neck.

644
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:58,929
Rym: So you could sit there and watch TV or do whatever you were doing or read a book or hang out, but you're in this sauna at the same time.

645
00:37:59,532 --> 00:38:00,629
Scott: Okay, that's a little crazy.

646
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:01,949
Scott: And where the hell are we going to put that?

647
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:03,070
Scott: And it's against our lease.

648
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:03,989
Rym: No, it's not.

649
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,808
Rym: The only things against our lease are pools and hot tubs.

650
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:08,710
Rym: Saunas aren't bodies of water.

651
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,488
Rym: The only reason those things are against the lease is because they're too heavy.

652
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:12,490
Scott: Uh-huh.

653
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,830
Rym: I mean, we can't even play DDR in our living room.

654
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,409
Rym: We're not going to be able to put a hot tub in there.

655
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,450
Scott: No, no, we're not.

656
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,249
Rym: But a sauna, they're actually pretty cheap.

657
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:20,649
Rym: I've considered getting one.

658
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:21,407
Scott: It's all you.

659
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,530
Rym: To go with the bidet.

660
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:23,567
Scott: It's all you.

661
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:25,230
Rym: All right, you got a thread?

662
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:26,969
Scott: Uh, let me pick one here.

663
00:38:27,393 --> 00:38:28,549
Scott: Oh, I got to mention this one.

664
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,765
Scott: There's a big thread by this guy named Kie.

665
00:38:34,372 --> 00:38:34,862
Scott: K-I-E-Y.

666
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:35,848
Scott: Whatever.

667
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:36,456
Scott: Kie.

668
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:37,804
Scott: Kie.

669
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:38,513
Rym: Kie.

670
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:39,493
Rym: Kie.

671
00:38:41,161 --> 00:38:41,287
Scott: Kie.

672
00:38:42,513 --> 00:38:44,410
Scott: It's a thread about wiimote modding.

673
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,570
Scott: Apparently, this guy wants to put a cool design on his wiimote.

674
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,330
Scott: He's tired of the plain white wiimote.

675
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:55,909
Scott: And he put up some pictures of some pretty cool designs of what he wants to make his wiimote look like.

676
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:56,949
Scott: And they're pretty cool.

677
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,769
Scott: He's got some art skills going on there.

678
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:06,730
Scott: And thus, the thread continues to this day with the saga of what he has done to mod his wiimote.

679
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,170
Scott: All the different-- he's like, try different paints and different screwdrivers.

680
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:17,588
Scott: And also, now he's going to try some dye, some vinyl dye really soon.

681
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:23,629
Scott: And he's going to see what it takes to mod your wiimote to make it look cool and put designs on it.

682
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:31,608
Scott: So if you're interested in doing that or just seeing the results, be they horrible or awesome, you should check this thread out.

683
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:33,290
Scott: It's pretty cool.

684
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:37,470
Scott: And you get to see the inside of a wiimote, which you can see on a bunch of other websites, but whatever.

685
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:43,729
Rym: So a while ago, we were doing an episode, and I talked about how I left work when I was done with my time.

686
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,949
Rym: And even though that there was still work to be done, but it was beyond my hours.

687
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,509
Rym: It was time for me to leave, and I had to go.

688
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,710
Rym: I had plans, so I left.

689
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:52,890
Rym: And someone started a thread.

690
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,890
Rym: It was Thayed who started it about a work ethic.

691
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:59,310
Rym: And he basically makes the point that-- let's see.

692
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,950
Rym: "Doctor, this one's been difficult.

693
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:05,829
Rym: I know he's been open for eight hours, but it's going to take another six hours to save his life.

694
00:40:06,354 --> 00:40:08,230
Rym: Nurse Rym, I'm not that kind of guy.

695
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:08,655
Rym: I'm out of

696
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:08,900
Rym: here.".

697
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:17,670
Rym: And he extrapolates through the whole thing, basically saying that-- and a lot of other people seem to go along with him that, wow, how could you just leave your work when the work is not done?

698
00:40:17,711 --> 00:40:18,928
Rym: I would fire someone like you.

699
00:40:19,872 --> 00:40:26,770
Rym: And I would just like to point out that at least it's been my experience and the experience of a lot of the people I have known in my life that have jobs.

700
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,769
Rym: Yeah, not just you, but a lot of people.

701
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:47,129
Rym: And not even just our geek friends, but older people, adults, people who are 20 or 30 years older than us, that most jobs, if you work the 40 hours a week and you're smart enough to do good work during that time, they're not going to fire you if you refuse to do unpaid overtime.

702
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:52,529
Rym: In fact, most companies seem like, in general, they'll just walk all over you.

703
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:59,030
Rym: And if you work unpaid overtime, they'll keep giving you unpaid overtime because they know that you won't fight it and you'll do it anyway.

704
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:08,070
Rym: And it seems that most of the people who work this unpaid overtime are people who don't have the balls to tell their employer, no, I'm not going to do that without compensation.

705
00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:14,290
Rym: And I've also found that the people who refuse to do the overtime generally are actually the ones who get the promotions anyway.

706
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:24,769
Scott: Yeah, because the people who are smart enough and bold enough to not work overtime tend to be the people who have more skills and better things to do with their time than be at work.

707
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:32,770
Rym: Or they would finish all the work they were given in 10 hours anyway, and they're only staying the 40 hours to make it look like they're doing some work anyway.

708
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:39,590
Rym: So they're not going to stay an extra few hours because you failed to plan properly in allocating your resources as a company.

709
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:46,928
Scott: And the other thing is all the examples he gives of a doctor, a fireman, oh, sorry, I got to go.

710
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:47,764
Scott: My time's up.

711
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:52,410
Scott: Those aren't jobs where you're hired to work x hours.

712
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:54,030
Scott: We're in the IT industry.

713
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,930
Scott: They pay us x dollars to work x hours a day.

714
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,446
Scott: That's it.

715
00:41:57,912 --> 00:42:00,810
Scott: It's not like we pay you to do this particular thing.

716
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:03,770
Scott: If I had a contract job, let's say I had a contract.

717
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:08,890
Scott: The contract would say, get this work done by this time on this date.

718
00:42:09,572 --> 00:42:12,110
Scott: And it didn't matter how many hours I worked.

719
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,270
Scott: As long as I got that work done by that date, nothing else matters.

720
00:42:15,852 --> 00:42:19,568
Scott: If you're a fireman, your job is when there's a fire, put it out.

721
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:22,330
Scott: It's all about job description and responsibilities.

722
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:27,429
Rym: And also how important the work is to you and to your company and all that and how much you care.

723
00:42:28,351 --> 00:42:29,910
Scott: And how much your company cares about you.

724
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:34,490
Scott: I mean, my company, I don't do shit and they don't seem to notice or care or anything.

725
00:42:34,812 --> 00:42:41,569
Rym: Or when I work at conventions, I mean, I was staffing at amazement and I had put in more than the time that I was required to put in.

726
00:42:42,032 --> 00:42:49,030
Rym: I had done a lot of work and I was on my way to have a cocktail, wander back to the room and go to bed.

727
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:50,410
Rym: And I had my cocktail.

728
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:54,770
Rym: And then as I'm walking back to the room, exhausted, someone runs up and says, there's an emergency.

729
00:42:55,293 --> 00:42:58,330
Rym: We need someone to cover the video game room until close.

730
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,850
Rym: And there was no one around.

731
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,930
Rym: So I said, all right, I'll do it.

732
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:08,629
Rym: And I stood there for another two and a half hours guarding the video game room until finally the click on ended for the night and I could go to bed.

733
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:12,426
Rym: I worked that unpaid overtime because that was important to me and I cared about it.

734
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:12,796
Scott: Yeah.

735
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:17,669
Scott: I mean, if my job was like GeekNights, I would just work on it all the time.

736
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,490
Rym: Whatever constant over time.

737
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:20,649
Rym: If I was my own boss.

738
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:21,710
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

739
00:43:22,112 --> 00:43:36,170
Rym: But when I work for a company, they're paying me for 40 hours worth of my time or well and or however much work they either how much work they can get out of me in 40 hours a week or however much work they expect out of me in 40 hours a week.

740
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,590
Scott: As long as their expectation is not unreasonable.

741
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:39,649
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

742
00:43:40,132 --> 00:43:53,508
Rym: If your work for a company that actually would fire you for refusing to do unpaid overtime, then you're working for the wrong company and you could probably easily get a job elsewhere unless you live in the middle of nowhere where there aren't jobs.

743
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,390
Rym: See, we live in downstate New York where the jobs compete for us and not the other way around.

744
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:01,810
Rym: I don't go to a job interview thinking.

745
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:03,450
Rym: I hope they give me this job.

746
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,529
Rym: I hope they give me this job.

747
00:44:05,111 --> 00:44:09,589
Rym: I go to job interviews thinking, do I want this job as opposed to that other job?

748
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,309
Rym: Which job am I going to accept?

749
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,170
Scott: Yeah, that's what I go into interviews like.

750
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,810
Scott: I'm like, all right, is which is this job awesome?

751
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,157
Scott: I don't know if it's that.

752
00:44:17,419 --> 00:44:25,866
Rym: when I interviewed for my current company and when I interviewed for IBM way back, I asked them more questions about their benefits and the pain, what they were going to do for me.

753
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:28,109
Rym: Then they asked me about my job skills.

754
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:28,660
Scott: Yep.

755
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:29,363
Scott: All right.

756
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:30,825
Rym: So you got one?

757
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,108
Rym: No, let's do two more.

758
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:32,948
Scott: All right.

759
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,247
Rym: Two more quick ones.

760
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:35,808
Scott: Quick ones, you say?

761
00:44:36,112 --> 00:44:37,009
Rym: Okay, all right.

762
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,750
Rym: Oh, because I got one.

763
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:43,350
Scott: This is actually an old thread from July, but it's been keeps coming back for the dead like a zombie.

764
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,126
Rym: Holy crap.

765
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,610
Scott: It's called the big headphones versus earbuds debate.

766
00:44:47,731 --> 00:44:48,228
Rym: All right.

767
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:49,789
Rym: I can weigh in here.

768
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,929
Rym: I don't even care what people say in that thread.

769
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:59,330
Rym: Headphones and earbuds are two tools that have two different uses and two different situations where they are useful.

770
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:00,669
Rym: There's no debate.

771
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,810
Rym: You use whichever one suits whatever your task is at the time.

772
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:10,529
Scott: Yeah, the thing is, is that some people use like headphones when they should use earbuds and vice versa.

773
00:45:10,895 --> 00:45:11,770
Scott: And that is a problem.

774
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:17,990
Scott: So I think people need to like, it's like people using hammers instead of screwdrivers and vice versa.

775
00:45:18,356 --> 00:45:19,090
Scott: I don't know what they're thinking.

776
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:22,030
Rym: Well, if all you have is a hammer, everyone looks like Trotsky.

777
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:24,250
Scott: Yeah, here's what that was.

778
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,749
Rym: Nice pick.

779
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:25,889
Scott: Here's what it comes down to.

780
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:32,009
Scott: Headphones, the big kind that cover your whole ear are only useful if you're not on the go.

781
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,330
Scott: I know a lot of people take these things out in the street.

782
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:34,888
Scott: Guess what?

783
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:36,527
Scott: You look like a doofus.

784
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:37,607
Scott: A doofus.

785
00:45:37,979 --> 00:45:38,023
Rym: No.

786
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:44,729
Scott: Do not bring headphones, big ones outside of your house unless you are a DJ or some other such thing.

787
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:45,014
Rym: Yeah.

788
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:45,830
Rym: You know what?

789
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:57,709
Rym: If you're a professional DJ, if you derive 51% or more of your income from DJing and DJ related activities, you are perfectly justified in wearing the biggest headphones you can find as a public accessory.

790
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,050
Rym: Think of it as like a badge.

791
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:08,730
Scott: You can wear them around your neck, like on the subway, but you cannot put them on your ears and listen to anything unless you are currently engaging in the act of DJing.

792
00:46:09,131 --> 00:46:12,210
Rym: Or I'd say if you are a professional DJ, it's okay to have mine.

793
00:46:12,674 --> 00:46:12,989
Scott: Maybe.

794
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:18,143
Rym: If I saw DJ Jin Ai in the street and he had headphones on, I wouldn't think, "Ah,

795
00:46:18,244 --> 00:46:18,589
Rym: tacky.".

796
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,701
Rym: I'd think, "Yo,

797
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:20,065
Rym: DJ."

798
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,888
Rym: Whatever.

799
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,070
Scott: But also, why would you bring them around?

800
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,750
Scott: They're so big and clumsy.

801
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,090
Scott: Where the hell are you putting them?

802
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:37,170
Rym: Also, headphones are either big and really, really cheap, or big and expensive, but they're actually cheap, or they're big and expensive.

803
00:46:37,691 --> 00:46:40,849
Rym: If they're big and expensive, don't carry them around because they're also fragile.

804
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:43,930
Rym: Good monitor headphones are very expensive.

805
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,990
Scott: I'm using the same- I mean, the really fancy ones, like you have to solder the things together yourself.

806
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:49,910
Scott: They come in pieces.

807
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,990
Rym: I mean, I'm using the same monitor headphones that I've had for over a decade.

808
00:46:54,690 --> 00:47:02,129
Rym: I've repaired them numerous times because I don't feel like spending the crazy amount of money you would take to get another equivalent pair of monitor headphones.

809
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:10,030
Scott: Anyway, earbuds, like the classic iPod earbuds, are basically useless and you should never use them ever.

810
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:11,990
Rym: No, because they're actually dangerous for your hearing.

811
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,550
Scott: Well, see, they're not dangerous for the hearing on their own.

812
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:18,849
Rym: They're dangerous for your hearing if you ever use them in situations where there is significant ambient noise.

813
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:23,949
Scott: Well, no, they still won't hurt your hearing unless you put the volume up.

814
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:28,770
Rym: Yes, Scott, if you're in a situation with significant ambient noise, you have to put the volume up or you can't hear it.

815
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:34,230
Scott: That's right, but if you refrain from putting the volume up, even when there is ambient noise, you won't hurt your ears.

816
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:41,590
Rym: But usually the level at which it'll harm you is well below the level at which you can hear whatever you're trying to listen to.

817
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:42,030
Scott: That's right.

818
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:55,690
Scott: So your choices are either hurt your hearing, only use earbuds in very quiet places, or suffer and not be able to hear what's coming out of them in situations where you would normally turn the volume up.

819
00:47:56,393 --> 00:48:02,230
Rym: Yeah, we won't really go into all the details here, but just read that thread and buy isolation earbuds.

820
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,609
Rym: Get isolation earbuds.

821
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,810
Rym: Insertion, isolation, insertion, whatnot.

822
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:16,650
Scott: Because they make a suction cup in your ear and they keep the sound out, and thus they let you keep the volume low while still being able to hear and you don't have to carry big-ass headphones around.

823
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:22,230
Rym: So we've had a bunch of good debates about spelling and grammar and pronunciation.

824
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:28,470
Rym: And one of our listeners, Kalarni, often corrects us when we pronounce things incorrectly, or at least in his eyes incorrectly.

825
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:34,289
Rym: And I would just like to note that he, a while ago, called me out on pronouncing asbestos the way I do.

826
00:48:35,055 --> 00:49:04,490
Rym: And over the last two months, by listening to various documentaries and news things and watching things, with one exception, everyone I have listened to says it exactly the way I say it, including two professional asbestos removers, one of whom is a person who removes it for the military, and one of them is a person who studies the effects of asbestos and all those diseases associated with asbestos, like lung cancer.

827
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:11,686
Rym: All the professionals and all the people in the BBC and all the people in NPR, without exception, say it the way I say it.

828
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:13,809
Rym: So, uh, big double-deuce.

829
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,407
Rym: Double-double-deuce.

830
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:16,365
Scott: Totally fun.

831
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:18,169
Rym: So yeah, we're all right.

832
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:21,649
Rym: And screw whatever that WAV file was that you posted.

833
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:25,569
Rym: We also there had a good argument about.

834
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:36,249
Rym: people tried to complain that the English language is somehow wasteful by using, you know, redundant letters and C and K are kind of the same and that sort of thing.

835
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:44,968
Rym: And I would like to point read a short post that I think defines that argument and defines both Scott and mine opinion on it very succinctly.

836
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:52,449
Rym: In English, the structure of our words provides a great deal of secondary data that our brains use to more quickly process what we read.

837
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:56,349
Rym: The extra letters give us clues as the origins, meanings, and histories of words.

838
00:49:56,913 --> 00:50:04,929
Rym: They give otherwise similar words distinct symbol shapes that can be processed as a unit as opposed to the more purely phonetic languages that must be processed sound by sound.

839
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,070
Rym: They provide redundancy, which allows even garbled messages to be partially understood.

840
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:13,129
Rym: The complexity and redundancy of English spelling are some of the language's greatest strengths.

841
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:16,270
Rym: Pronunciation is a definite drawback, but the benefits seem to outweigh.

842
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,390
Scott: Yeah, I do think there are some words that don't follow the rules.

843
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:21,290
Rym: Like what?

844
00:50:21,873 --> 00:50:22,930
Scott: I can't think of any right now.

845
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:23,729
Rym: Name one.

846
00:50:24,932 --> 00:50:29,467
Rym: Besides, you've got to admit, it would bother you if people spelled knigget without the G and the K.

847
00:50:29,951 --> 00:50:34,048
Scott: Of course, of course, but I'm saying there are just some words that-- Name a word.

848
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,589
Scott: I can't think of one right now.

849
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:36,065
Scott: All right.

850
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:36,810
Scott: I'll get back to you.

851
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,629
Rym: Yeah, get back with me.

852
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:38,610
Rym: We'll do a whole show on it.

853
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:39,110
Scott: All right.

854
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,827
Rym: We'll do a whole show on the English language.

855
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:42,270
Scott: All right.

856
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,067
Scott: You want to keep going?

857
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:45,310
Rym: We should probably stop.

858
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:46,368
Scott: Okay, let's stop.

859
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,389
Rym: I'll end it with this one, and I'm just going to read it.

860
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:53,205
Rym: I'm not going to follow up on it in any way, but Brian Shrimp posted a while ago on November 18th.

861
00:50:54,414 --> 00:51:00,609
Rym: "I had a dream tonight that I was listening to GeekNights, and they linked us to this photo of a smashed up PS3 when someone had dropped it.

862
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:02,369
Rym: At least I think this was a dream.

863
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:03,624
Rym: Can anyone laugh or

864
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:03,846
Rym: verify?".

865
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:09,968
Rym: We did not, in fact, talk about a PS3 being dropped at any point.

866
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,226
Scott: No, but you might want to go to smashmyps3.com.

867
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:15,370
Rym: I think you better call Randy.

868
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:16,369
Scott: You might.

869
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:21,470
Rym: Actually, Kiwi Bird posted, "I was once laying in my bed listening to GeekNights.

870
00:51:21,971 --> 00:51:25,487
Rym: The funny thing was my earbuds had fallen out and I was imagining the entire

871
00:51:25,528 --> 00:51:25,730
Rym: thing.".

872
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:31,530
Scott: Okay.

873
00:51:33,043 --> 00:51:36,714
Rym: A Merry Christmas, a Happy Hanukkah, a crazy Kwanzaa.

874
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,480
Rym: I can't think of any other holiday.

875
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,260
Scott: For the rest of us.

876
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,019
Rym: A glorious Festivus for the rest of us.

877
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:45,080
Rym: You can bet that we'll have our Festivus poll in the airing of Grievances.

878
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:48,277
Rym: Anyone who celebrates the solstice, I'm right there with you.

879
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,980
Scott: Noel, whatever.

880
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:52,100
Rym: Berna Yule Log.

881
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,620
Scott: Yule whatnot.

882
00:51:54,568 --> 00:51:54,819
Rym: Yes.

883
00:51:55,885 --> 00:52:00,380
Rym: I'd say Happy New Year, but we got a whole week of shows next week and we'll probably have a New Year's special.

884
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:00,986
Scott: Uh-oh.

885
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,159
Scott: That's dangerous.

886
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:10,600
Rym: Before we end, as I did all week, I don't think anyone listens to the Thursday shows who doesn't listen to at least one other day, so this is probably redundant.

887
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,460
Rym: I'll be very succinct.

888
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:21,199
Rym: If you like GeekNights and you're a member of Digg, Digg.com, D-I-G-G.com, please, please, please, if you like GeekNights enough, go there and Digg us.

889
00:52:21,904 --> 00:52:28,079
Rym: We are already beating out most of our friend podcasts in most categories that matter and we would like to keep it that way.

890
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,239
Scott: We mostly want it for humorous value, like, "Ha ha ha, you think you have more listeners than we do?

891
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:34,915
Scott: Look at how many Digg's we

892
00:52:34,976 --> 00:52:35,300
Scott: have.".

893
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:44,719
Rym: The fact that we have five feeds makes it hilarious because Anime World Order finally beat us by a couple Digg's in the anime category, well, the anime search category.

894
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,657
Rym: However, our main GeekNights feed still beats them by a lot, so it's like, "GeekNights, Anime World

895
00:52:49,698 --> 00:52:49,800
Rym: Order.".

896
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:58,640
Scott: It's like Anime World Order, which is a whole podcast just about anime, beat out the Wednesday shows of GeekNights by a few Digg's.

897
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,780
Rym: They're sandwiched between GeekNights and GeekNights.

898
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,320
Scott: Yep.

899
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,120
Rym: And while you're at it, consider this a plug.

900
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:10,700
Rym: There is a podcast called Fast Karate for the Gentlemen and it is one of my favorite podcasts.

901
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:16,579
Rym: In fact, both us and Anime World Order steal quite a bit of our humor from them on a regular basis.

902
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,900
Scott: Hey, they just came out with a new episode while we were recording this one.

903
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:20,300
Scott: Oh, really?

904
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,199
Scott: I'm downloading it right now.

905
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,000
Rym: I'm going to listen to that on my drive to Rochester.

906
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,559
Scott: It's called Soronary.

907
00:53:27,022 --> 00:53:39,600
Rym: So if you like Fast Karate or if you like Gentlemen, not only should you listen to Fast Karate for the Gentlemen, but while you're digging GeekNights with your massive botnet of shill accounts, I highly recommend that you also do the same for Fast Karate.

908
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:50,427
Rym: They currently have eight Digg's and they deserve at least 12 or 13.

909
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:52,510
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

910
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,190
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

911
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:07,050
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

912
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:13,249
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

913
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,369
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

914
00:54:15,531 --> 00:54:17,990
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

915
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:23,929
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

916
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:32,429
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

917
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:36,030
Scott: Just click the link that says send me an Odeo on the right side of our website.

918
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:41,490
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

919
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,810
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website which has everything.

00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:57,990
Scott: This means you can do whatever you want with it as long as you give us credit, don't make money, and share it in kind.

922
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:02,290
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

923
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,830
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
