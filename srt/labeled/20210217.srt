00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,031
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 17th, 2021.

2
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:11,251
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:15,100
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,424
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:20,820
Rym: Tonight we're talking about upcoming animation that we may want to watch.

6
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:23,178
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,958
Scott: So, you know, we have an official-ish GeekNights Discord where you could come and talk to the other listener.

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:45,720
Scott: And today there was, you know, a discussion that started with evil people who are now thankfully deceased, but it managed to wind its way around to Denethor.

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,299
Rym: Ah, Denethor.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:59,100
Scott: And someone incorrectly referred to Denethor as a king, and I had to correct them and point out that he was only a steward of Gondor and not the king.

11
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,759
Scott: That's why it's called "Return of the King" because the king comes back.

12
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:05,440
Rym: There's a certain kind of person for whom that is an extremely important distinction.

13
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:06,882
Scott: The most important.

14
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:18,840
Scott: But, as even though I am such a person who knows a fact, right, like that, I actually did not know, though always wondered, how the hell did it end up that way?

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:26,980
Scott: How did, you know, it's like, yeah, I know Isildur was killed, the ring fell on the lake, Gollum got it, Isildur was the king at the time, right?

16
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:31,920
Scott: But it's like, why didn't just, Isildur had children, why didn't they just become the king?

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,060
Rym: I can come up with plausible historical things, but yeah, I never actually thought about that because it was presented as a steward now.

18
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,220
Scott: I've thought about it often, I thought about it often, and not until today did I bother to actually fucking look it up.

19
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,440
Scott: And you know what, it's actually not as complicated as I thought it was, it's actually pretty straightforward.

20
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,520
Rym: Where his kids too young?

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,634
Scott: You don't know.

22
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:51,978
Scott: No, no, no.

23
00:01:53,202 --> 00:02:03,460
Scott: One of his children, basically, there's Gondor, right, and then Aragorn, we knew that he came from the north, the mysterious north, right?

24
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,953
Scott: In the north is another kingdom, Arnor, right?

25
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:08,500
Scott: It's another kingdom of men, right?

26
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,628
Scott: That's why there were so many kings of men, right?

27
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:13,260
Scott: Like Rohan is also men, right?

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,715
Scott: And apparently, Isildur was the king of Arnor and Gondor.

29
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:21,260
Scott: He was a king of two places.

30
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:28,773
Scott: And after he died, his child became king of only Arnor.

31
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:32,000
Scott: They were just sort of like, they just sort of gave up on Gondor.

32
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:43,200
Scott: All his children just in the north, and they basically, they just didn't rule over, they technically were the kings of Gondor by birthright, but they just didn't bother.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,399
Scott: They're just like, you know what, we're just gonna rule over Arnor and ignore Gondor.

34
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:53,580
Rym: This is already very, I've been learning a lot about how that kind of thing works thanks to Crusader Kings 3.

35
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:02,760
Scott: Yeah, so the steward of Gondor at the time just sort of ran the show even though they knew they weren't king, but they had to do the king's work of managing shit, right?

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,525
Scott: You know, government work.

37
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:09,920
Scott: And Denethor was the son of the son of the son of the first steward, whatever, right?

38
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:13,431
Scott: And then, you know, Aragorn comes out of the north.

39
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:16,180
Scott: He was king of Arnor already, right?

40
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,603
Scott: He's the king of Arnor.

41
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:25,640
Scott: He comes down, you know, and then he goes and he picks up the sword from the elves, and the elves are like, oh, you're the king of Arnor, actually came down from the north.

42
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:30,127
Scott: Okay, you want to be king of both places again.

43
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:31,891
Scott: No one's gonna stop you.

44
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,415
Scott: Except the bad guys.

45
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:34,176
Scott: The end.

46
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:35,740
Scott: And that's the story.

47
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:41,160
Rym: I will just never forget seeing the scene where Denethor comes to a conclusion.

48
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:45,560
Scott: That was how the conversation started, because we needed the gif for that scene.

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,382
Rym: Yeah, we did need that gif.

50
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:53,320
Rym: I look up that gif kind of often, because I will never forget the moment when the movie is serious, serious, serious, serious.

51
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:03,700
Rym: And that scene, just the way it was framed and the way they, the entire, like, there was a moment of silence and then multiple people just started laughing out loud in the theater.

52
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:09,857
Rym: I think it was that he yells and runs way longer than you would expect him to.

53
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:15,240
Scott: Especially for a person on fire.

54
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:16,562
Rym: Yep.

55
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:23,920
Rym: Like, I can't imagine looking at layouts of that castle, how he made it that far to actually jump off the edge while on fire the entire time.

56
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:33,280
Scott: Well, you know, the wiki that I was reading happened to also mention that Denethor was actually stronger than he, you know, you think, right?

57
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,134
Scott: Because you think about it, right, Saruman, right, was like a super strong wizard dude.

58
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:39,438
Scott: Like, damn, right?

59
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,220
Scott: But basically he was just directly corrupted by the Palantir, right?

60
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,420
Scott: Denethor was actually a good person and was pretty way stronger actually.

61
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,839
Rym: Until he sort of went crazy-ish.

62
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:56,770
Scott: Well, he didn't really, he didn't give in to Sauron, right?

63
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,740
Scott: He was, he was, he's still like anti-bad guy, right?

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,772
Scott: It's just, he basically, you know, became so depressed.

65
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,419
Scott: He's like, no, we can't win, right?

66
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,849
Scott: He wasn't like, you know, teaming up with the bad guys.

67
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:11,095
Scott: He was just so, just so full of despair.

68
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,080
Scott: He's like, well, we can't win this, right?

69
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,739
Scott: And that was, so he wasn't, he wasn't weak, right?

70
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,548
Rym: Yeah, I see Gandalf reading the same wiki.

71
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:22,940
Rym: Gandalf described him as proud and subtle, a man of far greater lineage and power.

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,200
Scott: And the reason, the reason he's messed up in the movie is because by the time you see him in the movie, he's already been so messed up, right?

73
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,540
Scott: From, you know, contact with the evil.

74
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,163
Rym: Yup.

75
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:34,780
Scott: Anyway.

76
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:42,160
Rym: Anyway, so yeah, in some news, we won't really talk about it today because it's kind of still coming out and I've only seen tricklings of it.

77
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,875
Rym: But the Nintendo Direct is happening right now and there's usually good- Okay, do you want us to just end it?

78
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:48,147
Scott: It ended.

79
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,200
Scott: then I came and started the show.

80
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,558
Rym: Ah, that explains it.

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,043
Scott: I told you that.

82
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:55,500
Scott: I told you that before we started the show.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,060
Rym: Yup.

84
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:59,120
Rym: I'm scrolling through Twitter because I didn't see a good roundup of everything.

85
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:00,431
Scott: I'll give you the roundup.

86
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:00,754
Scott: Ready?

87
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,198
Scott: Here it is.

88
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:03,576
Scott: I don't care about new controllers.

89
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,599
Scott: It depends on what, yeah, depending on what you care about, but the big Nintendo things is Mario Golf, which would be great if we were in college, but maybe, right?

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,640
Scott: There's gonna be a Skyward Sword HD remake, but I have it on Wii, so I don't feel like I need to buy that.

91
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,100
Rym: I never played it, and I did see that one because apparently they're gonna have two modes.

92
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,559
Rym: A mode with the motion controls and a mode where it's only buttons.

93
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,340
Scott: It's the kind of game where you play it once, you beat it, and you're done.

94
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:34,240
Scott: It's not bad like, say, Zelda Train game, but it's not, you know, it's not a top tier Zelda.

95
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,660
Rym: Yeah, Zelda Train and Twilight Princess were the only two Zeldas I ever started playing and just didn't bother finishing.

96
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,410
Scott: Splatoon 3 next year, 2022, was their highlight.

97
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,680
Scott: Some Xenoblades characters in Smash with a really cute intro they had during the direct.

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:07:07,000
Scott: Here's something I don't really care too much about Ninja Gaiden 3D games, but what they're doing is something I like a lot, which is instead of doing an HD remake, which they could easily do, they're just gonna sell a bundle of all three together.

99
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:20,160
Scott: And if I was gonna, if I was gonna play those games, like that actually is like, oh, you know, I might buy that, you know, not like Square Enix or like buy Final Fantasy 6, you know, remake whatever on its own for a pile of money.

100
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,563
Scott: It's like, no, how about you do this?

101
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:27,436
Scott: How about you sell Final Fantasy 1 through 10 or whatever in a bundle, right?

102
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:28,999
Scott: For 40 bucks or 30, right?

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,660
Scott: It's like, I will probably buy that maybe.

104
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,978
Rym: I would probably buy that.

105
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,304
Scott: Maybe, right?

106
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:36,839
Scott: It's like, so I kind of like that, that was in there.

107
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,000
Scott: Capcom's doing a thing.

108
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:41,800
Scott: There's a new Monster Hunter or something.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,194
Scott: You know, there's a new, people like that, I played that first, was it?

110
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:47,600
Scott: No More Heroes, right?

111
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:49,311
Rym: I saw the triangle game.

112
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,420
Rym: a lot of people are buzzing about.

113
00:07:51,421 --> 00:08:00,720
Scott: Yeah, that's a Square Enix game, which is the same series as Octopath Traveler, except it's more of a tactics battle kind of situation.

114
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,867
Scott: There should be a demo of it.

115
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:03,900
Scott: you can play today for free on your Switch.

116
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,820
Rym: I'm gonna check out that demo before I say anything about it, because that kind of game can go in a lot of different directions and most of them are bad.

117
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,620
Scott: I actually like the Octopath Traveler demo, but I wasn't about to pay money for a JRPG that I knew I wouldn't finish.

118
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:17,677
Scott: The demo was enough for me.

119
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,879
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure there's something I'm forgetting because it was kind of long.

120
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,860
Rym: Yeah, we'll probably talk about bits in more detail on Tuesday.

121
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:34,500
Scott: You know, depending on who you are and what you care about, there'll be some things in it that you cared about and some things that you didn't, because they rattled off a whole mess of games.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:43,219
Rym: In my feed, just people I follow on Twitter, if I don't look at it, all anyone was talking about was, "Oh my god, there'll be some Animal Crossing Mario

123
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:43,479
Rym: stuff.".

124
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:46,080
Scott: They already announced that before, that's not new news.

125
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,860
Scott: But that's still whatever we're talking about.

126
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,479
Scott: They re-announced it, yes.

127
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,540
Scott: I think the one thing that was new in that news is that they said you could put a warp pipe on your island so that way you can get around your island faster.

128
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,478
Rym: Ooh, I like that.

129
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,589
Scott: Yeah, it is.

130
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,079
Scott: That was good.

131
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:11,460
Rym: So, in some news, there's been a lot of chatter about Airwig and the Witch, the Studio Ghibli movie, that it looks bad, probably is bad, I haven't watched it yet, so I'll reserve judgement.

132
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,114
Rym: But if you watch the trailer for it, the animation looks terrible.

133
00:09:18,555 --> 00:09:20,219
Scott: Like, absolutely terrible.

134
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,540
Scott: I've actually only seen still images and I knew it was a thing and I knew it existed, but I don't even know, is it out yet or is it coming soon still?

135
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:28,559
Scott: If it's coming soon, it's coming very soon.

136
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,720
Rym: It's coming, yeah, there's reviews out already.

137
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,779
Scott: So it must be, is it out now?

138
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:37,640
Rym: I'm not 100% sure, because I wasn't really excited to see it, to be honest.

139
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,540
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't that hyped for it either.

140
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:46,637
Scott: Even though we usually say you should watch all, oh no, release date, December 30th, 2020, so it's been out.

141
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,200
Rym: So the reviews so far have been, like, scathing is not even close to describing.

142
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,877
Rym: I'm going to quote some of these reviews, I'm just flipping through right now.

143
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:05,280
Rym: Erig and the Witch, Studio Ghibli's first computer-generated feature is an unholy eyesore.

144
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,720
Rym: If nothing else, Goro Miyazaki's feature makes an effective argument for the magic of hand-drawn animation.

145
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:17,860
Scott: Maybe that's what hand-drawn animation needed, was bad CG, right?

146
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:24,200
Scott: It's like, there's plenty of good CG, we just talked about that Lupin movie, not the last Wednesday show or the one before that.

147
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:25,320
Rym: Yup, which looked amazing.

148
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:34,056
Scott: Right, it's like, you know, CG isn't necessarily a bad thing, but maybe that's what they need to get more money into.

149
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:36,380
Scott: the hand-drawn stuff, is examples of bad CG.

150
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,779
Rym: Oh, here's another quote for you.

151
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:48,780
Rym: While Erig and the Witch is far from the ugliest film of its kind, there's something uniquely perverse about seeing Ghibli's signature aesthetic suffocated inside of a plastic coffin.

152
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:56,520
Rym: Like, the lighting looks bad, the animation is stiff, like, it looks like a student film from five-plus years ago.

153
00:10:57,903 --> 00:10:59,499
Scott: I wonder what the backstory is.

154
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,468
Rym: Aha, that's the thing that no one's talking about.

155
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:06,260
Rym: I've seen fucking nobody talk about what I'm about to talk about.

156
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:08,012
Scott: How did it end up this way?

157
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:09,060
Scott: Was the budget way low?

158
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,703
Rym: So, the budget was basically zero.

159
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:22,820
Rym: This was a made-for-TV movie with a tiny crew that, in Japan at least, was basically talked about as a proof of concept.

160
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,240
Rym: Like, Ghibli put this together with a tiny team to explore 3D animation and do something.

161
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,339
Rym: This is not a full-feature theatrical release like everyone in America is talking about it as.

162
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,793
Rym: So, everyone's comparing this to, like, all the other Ghibli films.

163
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:40,760
Rym: You know how many people worked on this thing?

164
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,096
Rym: Like, so, it took a while to dig around because Ghibli won't talk about the budget or anything.

165
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:48,260
Rym: Like, I had to dig around for this.

166
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:59,140
Rym: There are a grand total of, there are fewer people in the entire staff for producing this film than were in the sound department for the Lupin movie.

167
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:20,740
Scott: Apparently, according to Wikipedia, right, which has citations if you trust them, it says that basically what happened is Goro said that his father, I'm reading from Wikipedia directly, Goro said that his father told him to go with it and Toshio Suzuki encouraged him, but after that he was left on his own and made the anime with young staff and didn't consult with the old guys at all.

168
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,880
Scott: He also said that he is the only one at the studio who knows the method of creating CG animation.

169
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:35,658
Scott: So, basically, it was like they had some resources of Studio Ghibli, but just the young inexperienced people on their own doing it, right?

170
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,380
Rym: Not even just the young inexperienced people.

171
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:41,807
Scott: And it was their first go at it, right?

172
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:47,420
Scott: You know, it wasn't like they brought in people from the outside who had knowledge or experience in this area.

173
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,905
Scott: So, here's something for you.

174
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:49,708
Rym: I want you to guess.

175
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,740
Rym: How many animators worked on this film?

176
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,519
Scott: Animators?

177
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,659
Rym: And people who are credited as an animator.

178
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:07,800
Scott: I mean, to make an 82 minute animation and actually deliver it, you need a lot, but I'm guessing it was way too, it's not, it's either way too many or way too few.

179
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,360
Rym: There is one animator credited.

180
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:13,139
Scott: Well, that's just not gonna cut it, right?

181
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,019
Scott: There is a character.

182
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,190
Scott: I wasn't gonna say one.

183
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,200
Scott: I was gonna say like ten.

184
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:24,840
Rym: The animation department consists of one character designer, one CG supervisor, one animator, and one animation director.

185
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:25,657
Scott: That's it.

186
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,220
Rym: Oh, and they credit a fifth person, but that's just the original character concepts.

187
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,060
Scott: So, they didn't outsource anything?

188
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:35,968
Rym: The production crew for this was tiny.

189
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:41,520
Rym: The budget, as far as anyone can surmise, do it like the journalist who tried to figure this out, was tiny.

190
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:52,380
Rym: And it was basically treated as like a made for TV movie that, and even by that standard, it's not good, but people in America are really...

191
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,260
Scott: Listen, if you get yourself and a few friends together, right, and you slap together 82 minute long movie...

192
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,235
Rym: Like, my hat is off to you.

193
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,979
Scott: And you put that shit on YouTube, that's pretty good.

194
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:10,080
Rym: If that was how this was framed to me before I saw that teaser trailer, I would have been a lot more sympathetic to it.

195
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:11,019
Rym: The problem is...

196
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,300
Scott: I think it also, you know, the Studio Ghibli brand, right, when you start this movie, does it show a blue screen with a Totoro on it?

197
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,920
Scott: 'Cause that's like, that's the problem, right?

198
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,601
Rym: It's

199
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:35,480
Scott: like, I've never made a shoe in my life, but if I were to, you know, design a shoe and then I was able to legitimately slap a Nike logo on the side of it, and someone put the shoe on and broke their foot, and then the shoe fell apart, right?

200
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,459
Scott: They would have a complaint.

201
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:40,760
Rym: Yup, but that's kind of the thing that I don't see everyone talking about.

202
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:49,980
Rym: Everyone's just trashing this movie, and pretty legitimately, it's not good, from any account, but they're also trashing it by comparing it to, like, Princess Mononoke.

203
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,020
Scott: That's 'cause they put the same Studio Ghibli logo on it.

204
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:54,310
Scott: They should have done that.

205
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,500
Scott: They should have put some other brand on there.

206
00:14:55,741 --> 00:15:01,500
Rym: I don't know where the breakdown is, but at least in the US, like, this is being marketed as the next Ghibli movie.

207
00:15:02,562 --> 00:15:04,200
Scott: It is technically a Ghibli movie.

208
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,020
Rym: So,

209
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:26,020
Scott: uh, maybe you shouldn't, you know, this is why, when you look at, like, other companies, right, like, especially, you know, publishers in the book world, they have imprints where it's like, yeah, all those ten different brands are actually one company, but they keep all those brands alive because, you know, marketing reasons, right?

210
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,760
Scott: You know, that they don't want to be, like, imagine if, you know, like, Penguin Books, they have Penguin Classics, right?

211
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:44,720
Scott: Imagine if every book they published, even, like, some, you know, sleazy, new, like, pulp sci-fi thing, they're like, Penguin Classics, you know, and it's, like, something like that, right, 'cause they only have one brand.

212
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,464
Scott: That's what Studio Ghibli's done here.

213
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:52,720
Scott: They only got one brand, and they slapped it on everything, and then it's like, well, maybe you should have made a different brand.

214
00:15:53,101 --> 00:16:03,720
Rym: Is whether or not this was a situation of this just being marketed outside of Japan, like, in the wrong way, like, for whatever reason, the decision was made to treat this as a Ghibli movie.

215
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:11,980
Scott: Try to make, try to, I mean, you can, you can make, you're not gonna make, it's, it's basically, if you just ignore it, right, you won't make any money, you won't lose any money, you won't make any money, though.

216
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:23,920
Scott: So, if you wanna, like, hey, here's a thing, we can legitimately put a Ghibli logo on this, and say that, and some people will give us money based on that alone, and nothing else, regardless of how good it is, why would we not do that?

217
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:24,879
Scott: We will make money.

218
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,460
Rym: Yep, but you might poison your brand, or cause these, uh, reviews to come out about this thing.

219
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:41,100
Scott: There are already Ghibli movies that are not good, it is not a perfect run, like, uh, some other people who have had a perfect run, so, therefore, uh, you know.

220
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:48,940
Rym: Is it that, or is this some sort of, like, power struggle or passive aggressive thing within the studio, like, did they set Goro up to fail?

221
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:51,859
Scott: I don't know, maybe, who knows.

222
00:16:52,200 --> 00:17:00,538
Rym: Yeah, it's just, it's, it annoys, the thing I'm annoyed about the most is that everyone who's reviewing it and talking about it does not at any point talk about the size of the production.

223
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:01,400
Rym: At all.

224
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,980
Rym: I don't know if they just didn't, like, think to look.

225
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,859
Scott: I mean, people, when people, people judge a thing, you just gotta judge the end product, right?

226
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:08,720
Scott: I do agree with that.

227
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,806
Scott: You're applying a different standard of quality, right?

228
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:18,920
Scott: It's good or it's bad, it's like, even if it has excuses and reasons it was good or bad that are perfectly legitimate, it doesn't make it good.

229
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,640
Rym: Well, that's it, I'm not saying that the reviews should treat it better, I'm saying the reviews should include this information.

230
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,779
Scott: Yeah, the job of the person is to say, look, um, you know, don't, you should or shouldn't watch this, you shouldn't.

231
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,167
Scott: Yep.

232
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:38,340
Scott: Of course, I don't know, maybe they could all be, I don't think they're wrong, I'm guessing, I haven't seen it, it could be good and they could all be bad reviewers who are wrong about things.

233
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,240
Rym: If you watch the teaser trailer, it does just look amateurish, like, it looks like Toy Story but bad.

234
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,319
Scott: I'm not saying it's likely, I'm saying it's possible.

235
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:56,440
Rym: Yeah, but, like, by contrast, in the US, the budget for a movie is usually, like, very prominently featured in reviews of the movie, like, that's always a point that's brought up.

236
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,240
Rym: As far as I can tell, Japanese studios, like, Ghibli in particular, they don't talk about their budgets.

237
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:06,926
Scott: I think the reason that that's a thing in the US, I think there's, like, laws or other, some sort of regulations.

238
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:12,171
Scott: and just the way Hollywood specifically works is that that information ends up being public.

239
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:20,260
Scott: and I, the thing is, that's something I talk about a lot when I talk other industries, especially, like, Apple, Nintendo, right, whatever.

240
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,839
Rym: Even my industry, like, I don't have to tell you what the budget is for something I'm working on.

241
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:28,900
Scott: Right, they're so secretive and I'm always, like, why are you so secretive?

242
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,700
Scott: And it's, like, one of the examples I can always bring up is, like, look, the movie industry is not as much less secretive.

243
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:45,000
Scott: They just tell, you just know way in advance who's being cast for what, what's been optioned, who's budgeted for this, you can read all that stuff, it's all just out there, right?

244
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:50,840
Scott: And it doesn't seem to hurt the movie industry, even though you know movies are coming way in advance, it just hypes them up more.

245
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:57,560
Scott: It's, like, Apple, if you tell us what's going to be an iPhone 15 in three years, it's just going to hype people up more, right?

246
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:06,520
Scott: And if that makes people say, well, if, you know, people will start saying stuff like, well, you know what, if that's what's an iPhone 15, that's the one to get, right?

247
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:17,220
Scott: Because 16 looks meh and 14 is meh, 15's the sweet spot, then just don't bother to make iPhone 14 and 16, just make the 15 after you can see what people's response is to that, right?

248
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:46,680
Scott: It only helps you to be less secretive, I don't think that the, you know, and I really want to be, like, I really, really want to interview anyone who has or does work at a secretive place, you know, and get them to explain, you know, I'm not asking you to tell me secrets, I want to know your reasons for, like, Tim Apple, tell me why you're so secretive, how does it benefit you, show me proof that it benefits you, right, to be secretive, you're not just doing it because you can.

249
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:47,680
Rym: Anyway.

250
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,560
Rym: I mean, the real answer is we just got to nationalize more stuff and have a lot more government regulation on everything, of course.

251
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,420
Scott: Sure, sure, yeah, but anyway.

252
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,875
Rym: Yeah, so you got some news?

253
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,680
Scott: Do I have a news, what was it again?

254
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:01,180
Rym: We just talked about this, Crunchyroll.

255
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:10,620
Scott: Alright, yeah, so, you know, we talked about Crunchyroll and Funimation merging a while ago, right, under Sony or whatever.

256
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,340
Rym: Yeah, the great consolidation of the anime distribution industry.

257
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:25,080
Scott: So I thought that at that, you know, you know, at what point are we going to see the complete merging, one of them disappearing, folding into the other, everyone gets an account on the other thing, something like that, right?

258
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:37,260
Scott: But until then, they're actually, surprisingly worse, are still new shows being added to both services, Funimation and Crunchyroll separately, and they just announced a bunch of new shows to go on Crunchyroll.

259
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:42,360
Scott: And a lot of them are shows that you can completely ignore and should not watch.

260
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:51,418
Scott: For example, there was one that I recognized from the olden days of anime, they said, "Oh yeah, Stelvia is coming to

261
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:52,240
Scott: Crunchyroll.".

262
00:20:52,300 --> 00:21:04,279
Scott: And the only thing I remember about Stelvia is that I've seen the DVD cover at Media Play and at the Anime Club way back in the early 2000s, and I was like, "Well, that looks like garbage and I'm never going to watch

263
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:04,340
Scott: it.".

264
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:07,700
Rym: I didn't say it was garbage, my thinking was, "That looks like...".

265
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,589
Scott: I said, "It looks like

266
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:08,791
Scott: garbage.".

267
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,096
Rym: I thought, "That looks like an anime,

268
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:12,640
Rym: period.".

269
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:23,760
Rym: It was Stelvia, like, Arise of Mind, Scryde, were just all these shows that I'd see, and I'd hear people talking about it in the club, but I just had no desire to ever even look at them.

270
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,247
Scott: It came out in 2003, so I'm correct.

271
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:29,059
Scott: But yeah, you don't need to watch that unless you really got nothing to do.

272
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:36,360
Scott: But there were two robot shows that I was surprised to see on Crunchyroll, and I'm going to watch one of them.

273
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:46,880
Scott: So there's the original, uh, Voltus 5, which is like a super old-school classic robot anime that I, you know, the kind of thing you'd never think you would see, you know, released.

274
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,179
Rym: Yeah, like the robot literally looks like a toy with his fist out if you've never seen it.

275
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,340
Scott: Yep.

276
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:56,773
Scott: So I'm really surprised to see that, uh, and I'm going to maybe probably watch some.

277
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:59,380
Scott: I don't know if I'll watch every episode of it, but I'm going to watch some.

278
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:05,752
Scott: And then, Tetsujin 28, the oldest robot show, but actually not the oldest version of it.

279
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:09,920
Scott: It was a later remake of Tetsujin 28.

280
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,100
Scott: I don't know what year this one's from.

281
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:18,180
Rym: Well, kind of like how the original Astro Boy, watch a few episodes to, like, get the deal, but honestly, the '80s Astro Boy is the one to watch for real.

282
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,742
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

283
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:23,532
Scott: But yeah, I don't know which one this is.

284
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,620
Scott: It must be, oh, it might be the series.

285
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,240
Rym: This is the 2004.

286
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,143
Rym: Oh, 2004?

287
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:35,480
Scott: Okay, it's not the 2000, because there was apparently another one from 2013 to 2016.

288
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,985
Rym: Yeah, what I'll say about Tetsujin 28, I've seen a couple episodes, like, I don't know a lot about it, honestly, but- Gigantor.

289
00:22:41,187 --> 00:22:42,499
Scott: Gigantor is the same thing.

290
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:55,961
Rym: Yeah, if you watch, like, I don't know, Big O or Giant Robo, and you want to know, like, where some of those inspirations came from, there is a straight line back to Tetsujin 28.

291
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:58,045
Scott: Tetsujin 28 was, like, the first robot show.

292
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:58,967
Scott: Like, the first one.

293
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:04,700
Scott: And, you know, the kid is remote controlling the robot with, like, a little remote control and such.

294
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,826
Scott: And it's, you know, it's actually pretty good.

295
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:10,509
Scott: There's a lot of good going on there.

296
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:16,000
Scott: that's what caused people to be so inspired and create an entire, you know, genre of robot animes.

297
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,581
Scott: Yeah.

298
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:24,255
Scott: So, this isn't the original, original one, but it is, you know, the same storyline remade for the umpth time or whatever.

299
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:27,040
Scott: So, you know, I'll probably, I'll give it a look.

300
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:27,840
Rym: Yep.

301
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:39,080
Rym: So, one really brief thing, but we'll skip talking about this in more depth until the main bit, because it's very relevant to that, but Bell, Memorial Hosted as upcoming new movie, a teaser trailer dropped today.

302
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:46,422
Scott: Yeah, we actually talked about it, and then the teaser dropped, like- That's beautiful.

303
00:23:46,462 --> 00:23:51,480
Rym: I'm getting summer wars crossed with Beauty and the Beast vibes from this in a big way.

304
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:52,784
Scott: Anyway.

305
00:23:53,026 --> 00:23:54,760
Scott: So, yeah, we'll talk about that more in the main bit.

306
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,904
Scott: It looks- It was such a coincidence that I mentioned the movie.

307
00:23:57,944 --> 00:23:59,226
Scott: I was like, "What was that movie he's working

308
00:23:59,286 --> 00:23:59,386
Scott: on?".

309
00:23:59,446 --> 00:23:59,727
Scott: "Oh, right,

310
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:00,067
Scott: Bell.".

311
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:04,274
Scott: And then, like, minutes later, a trailer for it drops.

312
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:05,295
Scott: And I'm just like, "What the fuck?

313
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:06,357
Scott: Did I speak that into

314
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:06,938
Scott: existence?".

315
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:15,836
Rym: Like- There's probably only, like, 30 or 40 frames of animation from it that you could even see in this teaser trailer.

316
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:17,139
Rym: It does not give you much to go on.

317
00:24:18,263 --> 00:24:19,378
Scott: It gives me enough to go on.

318
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,480
Scott: Oh, I've got enough to go on, if this was not going to- I'm going to be first in line to see that movie.

319
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:23,880
Scott: Yep.

320
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:37,700
Rym: So, in some more industry news, I feel like on all four days of GeekNights, we've had a lot of news recently about big consolidations in industries, because there's a lot of reasons why that's happening right now.

321
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:47,280
Rym: But another thing that's happening is, not consolidations, but a lot of big companies are shutting down parts of themselves, either that they had spun off or that they had acquired.

322
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,340
Rym: So, Disney just shut down Blue Sky Studios, like, in the middle of a movie that they're almost done with.

323
00:24:56,741 --> 00:25:04,006
Scott: Yeah, so I don't know if people know this, but Blue Sky is the CG animation studio that brought you- Yeah, all the Ice Age movies.

324
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:07,700
Scott: And the studio was actually located in, I think, Connecticut?

325
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,253
Rym: Yeah.

326
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:16,520
Scott: So, it's like almost all the animation stuff is going on, obviously, California area, right?

327
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,214
Scott: So, this was sort of like the last animation place that was in, not California, in the United States.

328
00:25:25,635 --> 00:25:26,296
Scott: At least, big one.

329
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:28,360
Scott: There's obviously small ones all over the place.

330
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,348
Scott: You know, probably in New York City, there's still probably a few here and there, right?

331
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:32,451
Scott: But not big ones.

332
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,520
Scott: The big ones that are making the big movies, they're all in California.

333
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:45,837
Scott: And so, that was kind of meh because, you know, usually when a place is closed down, as opposed to consolidate, you know, they usually see on Twitter, "Oh, jobs.

334
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,760
Scott: Let's find jobs for these people," right?

335
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,946
Scott: Because they lost their job through no fault of their own.

336
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,109
Scott: They're not bad at their job.

337
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:52,854
Scott: They're not canceled people, right?

338
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:54,800
Scott: You know, they're all quality animators.

339
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,527
Scott: But here's the problem.

340
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,640
Scott: They live in these cars, right?

341
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:05,540
Scott: I guess you can get remote work easily these days, I guess.

342
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:06,220
Scott: At least for now.

343
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,540
Scott: Right.

344
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:15,087
Scott: It's like, you know, if you live, if the job you have is somehow tied to the place you are, right?

345
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:29,540
Scott: And the thing is with animation, there's no, you know, reason that all the animation places should be located together other than that makes all the people in the industry live in that place so that they can, you know, all switch between the companies.

346
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,346
Rym: But it also makes it easier if you're doing that stuff to have a pool of people to hire.

347
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:43,077
Rym: Like, there's a reason why so many companies like Amazon want to be in New York City because they know there's a guaranteed critical mass of any possible profession.

348
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:45,400
Rym: There'll be 10 people coming to your door with resumes.

349
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,921
Scott: Right, exactly.

350
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:53,810
Scott: So when a place is in, you have a business in a different kind of place, not an atypical geography.

351
00:26:54,611 --> 00:26:59,397
Scott: Like, I know there's like video game studios that are occasionally, they seem to actually be spread out a bit, right?

352
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,400
Scott: They're not all centralized in one location.

353
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:01,861
Scott: Yep.

354
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:06,495
Rym: There's like four or five nexuses of a lot of game studios, like Prague of all places.

355
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:08,400
Rym: There's a lot of video game studios in Prague.

356
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,462
Scott: And then Carolina's got some, I think, right?

357
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:18,634
Scott: You know, but it's like, if you have a business, you'll, if you bring your business to like a small town or a small, a smaller city, right?

358
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:22,420
Scott: Say like a Rochester or a, an Ohio city or something like that.

359
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:22,620
Scott: Right.

360
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,282
Scott: Um, and it's like, you can sort of help that town a lot.

361
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:29,605
Scott: You boost their economy by building a company there by creating jobs there and such.

362
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:29,825
Scott: Right.

363
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:36,389
Scott: And then if you're shut down though, it's like, it's like a double, it's like twice the pain, right?

364
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:51,280
Scott: Cause not only is that place now hurt, but those people, there's nowhere for them to work cause they're living in some small town, smaller city that you started in and not living in New York City or LA where they could just get another job.

365
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,940
Scott: No problem.

366
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:56,007
Scott: Um, so it's extra, it's extra sad and damaging on that level.

367
00:27:56,388 --> 00:28:03,540
Scott: In addition to the normal level of, you know, this art producing thing is now shut and art, the art fountain is spreading out less art.

368
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,540
Rym: Yup.

369
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,502
Rym: Even worse here in this particular case.

370
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:11,966
Rym: So like blue sky did really good stuff like the peanuts movie, which do you know, whether you, whether you liked it or not, right.

371
00:28:11,986 --> 00:28:14,187
Scott: Well, you know, I didn't like, I'm not an ice age fan.

372
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:16,009
Rym: Did you ever see the peanuts movie?

373
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:17,630
Scott: Uh, which one?

374
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,712
Rym: The new one, the two, like from like 2015 dive nuts.

375
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:23,454
Rym: No, it's, it's a real good movie.

376
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:25,676
Rym: Like surprisingly good.

377
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:26,977
Rym: It's also beautiful.

378
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:28,258
Rym: It's in a unique style.

379
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:31,460
Scott: Well, isn't all the peanut stuff on Apple TV plus now.

380
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:33,123
Rym: I don't actually know.

381
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:34,225
Rym: I saw it on a plane.

382
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:41,720
Scott: I think Apple TV plus now has all the peanuts licensed stuff and I have an Apple TV plus free trial for a whole year cause I got an iPhone.

383
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,906
Rym: Well, Disney is absorbing all of blue skies, characters, and IP, all the stuff that they like directly own.

384
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,427
Scott: What's not clear is what's happening.

385
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:49,749
Scott: Disney doesn't own peanuts.

386
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:53,253
Rym: The other stuff, because one of the things, if you're listening to GeekNights, you've probably heard of Nimona.

387
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:59,800
Rym: You might know that blue sky was making the Nimona movie, which apparently was turning out fantastic.

388
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,982
Rym: Like this was a for real movie.

389
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:05,447
Rym: that was, it only had like 10 months left in production, according to this article.

390
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:11,495
Rym: And apparently when, with the change with Disney shutting them down, Disney's not absorbing that movie to finish it.

391
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:13,037
Rym: They're just canceling the entire thing.

392
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:13,658
Rym: Yeah.

393
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:14,860
Scott: Mouse guard movie got shut down.

394
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,603
Rym: Mouse guard movies suffered that same fate.

395
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:18,345
Rym: This is, we talk about this a lot.

396
00:29:18,646 --> 00:29:26,958
Rym: A movie does not exist until it is in a theater or published because studios, there are entire ass movies that get made and then just burned.

397
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,180
Rym: Like that just happens.

398
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:31,884
Scott: I look forward to the people who were there, right?

399
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:38,833
Scott: Indirectly or directly releasing the materials they did produce via leaks or their resumes.

400
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:44,540
Scott: when they're applying for other jobs, their portfolios will contain things from the Nimona movie and we can see them that way.

401
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,783
Rym: It's a shame because I'm adjacent to like Emily.

402
00:29:46,803 --> 00:30:00,460
Rym: We know a bunch of people who like work there and the best I can tell is that the Nimona movie was like an A plus movie and it was arguably, might've been the first like full on theatrical movie that was just based on a web comic.

403
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:05,720
Scott: Um, tough call maybe?

404
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:08,500
Rym: That Megatokio movie never happened.

405
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,280
Scott: No, good question.

406
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:24,040
Scott: But yeah, there have been more, um, there have been movies made based on, you know, indie comics or less than mainstream comics.

407
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Rym: Well like Scott Pilgrim, the movie was made and it was based on that very short comic run.

408
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:30,238
Scott: Exactly.

409
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,980
Rym: But a web comic like with a capital w like what we think of as web comics.

410
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,361
Scott: Right.

411
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:36,521
Scott: Yeah.

412
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:55,440
Scott: I think is, I think these days I don't really put web comic in a different category than just like, you know, it's like you happen to put your comic, you know, on a website, but it's like, I don't see that as any different than a comic, you know, that's like, okay, some independent individual creator wrote and drew a thing and published it.

413
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,121
Scott: Right.

414
00:30:56,201 --> 00:31:12,040
Scott: And they happen to, whether you happen to put it in a book first and sell it to the comic book store or happen to like Scott Pilgrim or, you know, you get a deal with someone like, you know, one of the smaller publishers, um, and you get it out that way or you put it on a website.

415
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,968
Scott: I don't really see them.

416
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,300
Scott: Those as different categories.

417
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:15,160
Scott: Right.

418
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:23,200
Rym: There was a time when it was very distinct, but that was large because it was an error when there wasn't much else on the internet at the time.

419
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,161
Scott: Exactly.

420
00:31:24,261 --> 00:31:30,046
Scott: You know, I mean, it's, it's, it's not, I don't think it's ever coming back, but like I think of just, I think of just Cucumber Quest, right?

421
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:31,647
Scott: It's like, yeah, is it a web comic?

422
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:33,629
Scott: It came out on the website.

423
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:34,050
Scott: Right.

424
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,511
Scott: But also it's a book.

425
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:38,093
Scott: It's like, is it, it's a comic.

426
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:45,960
Scott: Was it, you know, which, whether you published it, which way doesn't change what, like you make it a different category than Penny Arcade.

427
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,880
Rym: What I feel like this movie might've done though.

428
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:49,210
Scott: It's not a different medium.

429
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,420
Scott: It's a different genre, obviously.

430
00:31:50,420 --> 00:32:01,916
Rym: The reason it hadn't actually been able to come out is I think it would have opened the door to more movie studios looking to dig through back catalogs of web content to look for stuff that they can fund and make movies with.

431
00:32:02,277 --> 00:32:04,360
Rym: Like it would have opened the door to another content mine.

432
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,400
Scott: Only if it was successful.

433
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,728
Rym: Yes, of course.

434
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:08,860
Rym: Only if it was successful.

435
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:09,901
Scott: Right.

436
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:14,347
Scott: It's like, you know, I think that's sort of the thing is, you know, you had your scout pilgrim.

437
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:20,536
Scott: It didn't make that much money, even though it's sort of a fantastic movie that became kind of a, it's kind of a thing, right?

438
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:23,080
Scott: But it didn't make a, it didn't make a fortune necessarily.

439
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:33,292
Scott: Um, so it's like, if someone comes out and is like, Hey, I made a movie based on some, you know, indie comic, I found it, you know, tea calf, right?

440
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:34,293
Scott: And it's a big hit.

441
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:39,539
Scott: Then you're going to see movie execs go in a tea calf to buy to things.

442
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,040
Scott: Right.

443
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:44,570
Scott: Um, but until then you're going to, this is, this is as far as it's gone.

444
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:48,100
Scott: right now is basically mouse guard movie being made canceled.

445
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,054
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

446
00:32:58,455 --> 00:33:00,056
Rym: So, uh, what did I have here?

447
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:00,277
Rym: Right.

448
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,360
Rym: Uh, Shogi is a game that I, I appreciate.

449
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,624
Rym: Like it's, you know, some people, people talk about it as Japanese chess.

450
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:09,086
Rym: Like it's a chess like game.

451
00:33:09,506 --> 00:33:13,250
Rym: If you've never played chess like game or Shogi, it's like the Duke.

452
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:33,366
Rym: But, uh, a difficulty that both chess and Shogi share is that if you look at the board and no one has taught you the game, fuck, if you're going to figure out what to do, like why would you know that the horse moves forward to and left or right one?

453
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,949
Rym: Like who's got, there's no way to figure that out from the looking at it.

454
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:37,910
Rym: Someone has to explain it.

455
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:38,330
Scott: Yeah.

456
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:48,628
Scott: You need a rule book or an explanation and they need to memorize the way each piece moves and associate those movement patterns with those symbols, which, you know, it doesn't take that long.

457
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:49,450
Scott: I was able to do it.

458
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,012
Rym: But it's a barrier to entry.

459
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:55,340
Scott: I almost never play chess, but I could tell, I could teach you how to play at any time.

460
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:55,721
Scott: Right.

461
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:59,127
Scott: Um, so it's not complicated, but it is yes.

462
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:00,470
Scott: A barrier to entry.

463
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,757
Rym: Because like I, when I was a kid, I was fascinated by chess cause like all the adults were playing it.

464
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:09,965
Rym: So I wanted to play, but I couldn't even poke at it until I memorized all these pieces.

465
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:12,188
Rym: So what I had was this not like checkers.

466
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,010
Scott: You don't got to know nothing.

467
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,291
Scott: Yup.

468
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:20,545
Rym: I use a little chess set that was like a fellow looking pieces and they just had arrows that showed how the piece I was moving moved.

469
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:22,650
Rym: So I could dive right into the game.

470
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,753
Scott: The Duke, each piece tells you how it moves on it.

471
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:26,254
Scott: Yeah.

472
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:30,739
Rym: So this is a Kickstarter for a shogi set.

473
00:34:31,261 --> 00:34:36,027
Rym: And the person who is pushing this, who like had the idea is a Monica.

474
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:37,168
Scott: Is it a Japanese person?

475
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,710
Scott: Okay.

476
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:38,690
Rym: It's a new Kickstarter.

477
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,155
Scott: I was going to say, I was hoping it was a Japanese person.

478
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:42,337
Scott: So it's not a cultural issue.

479
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:47,764
Rym: So Monica Kitau is pretty famous globally because she is an one.

480
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:48,846
Rym: She's a Nida.

481
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:51,710
Rym: Like she's a, she is like near the top, like the equivalent of a chess master.

482
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:59,623
Rym: Oh, she, her big thing is let's get more people, especially girls to play shogi globally.

483
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:02,067
Rym: Like let's advocate, let's get people to enjoy this game.

484
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:03,910
Scott: Yeah, that sounds good.

485
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,192
Rym: So basically she contacted this person.

486
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:22,790
Rym: There's a whole, you'd read the Kickstarter to see all the details to basically ask them if they could create a language neutral, easy to learn version of shogi to make it easy for people who have never played it before to jump right in and experience the mechanics of the game to fall in love with them.

487
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:23,591
Scott: Yeah.

488
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:31,244
Scott: This is something, you know, I've played shogi maybe once or twice and I had like a little paper guide that told me how each piece moved because each piece has like a kanji written on it.

489
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:34,410
Scott: And I would look on the guide, say, oh, that piece moves like this, that piece moves like that.

490
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,177
Rym: Then the pieces can upgrade and then they move differently like the Duke.

491
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:39,780
Scott: And it, you know, I didn't do that.

492
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,866
Scott: well, but it's like, okay, it's a game I can see, you know, it's not bad.

493
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:44,870
Scott: Um, but it's like, I didn't get into it.

494
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:58,569
Scott: And, but it's like, you know, whether you're a child who, you know, like a Rym child looking at a chess set or even just an adult who doesn't know Japanese kanji, or even if you do know kanji, I don't know if that's necessarily going to help you know how each piece moves.

495
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,370
Scott: Right.

496
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,716
Scott: I could make a chess set where it says it's just the word king is written on the king piece.

497
00:36:03,756 --> 00:36:06,080
Scott: I don't think that that helps you know how it moves.

498
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,301
Scott: Right.

499
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:07,142
Rym: Exactly.

500
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:11,970
Rym: Like kings are slow and queens are just a moving field artillery.

501
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:13,674
Scott: I don't know.

502
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:16,900
Scott: Uh, but yeah, that's, uh, that's fantastic.

503
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:19,405
Scott: Uh, I don't know why there has to, this has to exist.

504
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:20,768
Scott: I can't believe it doesn't exist already.

505
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:21,670
Scott: It seems so obvious.

506
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:22,391
Rym: Yeah.

507
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:28,078
Rym: And the cool thing is this isn't just, I have seen shogi sets and chess sets that have like diagrams and things on the pieces.

508
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:37,090
Rym: This one goes further and the Kickstarter actually talks about why it was designed the way it was to make it completely language neutral to facilitate learning the game.

509
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:46,302
Rym: But also remember shogi has like the board, there's like a neutral zone and then the defensive zone and the attacking zone, but none of that's written on the board.

510
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:51,629
Rym: You have to just know the board itself is different to make it clear where the neutral zone is.

511
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,711
Scott: That's good.

512
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:54,132
Rym: It's little things like that.

513
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:56,174
Rym: It's just, it's really cleverly designed.

514
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:56,815
Rym: I'm backing it.

515
00:36:57,135 --> 00:37:10,510
Rym: Uh, and it also includes three by three and four by four little boards with like slightly different rules to do like young child learning or like quick learning or kind of like how go players learn on small boards and then level up to bigger boards.

516
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:16,630
Scott: Ooh, I guess, you know, chess, I've never seen like smaller chess than regular chess.

517
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:22,344
Rym: The only smaller chess I've ever seen are chess problems, which you've got to be a particular kind of person to enjoy chess problems.

518
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:24,570
Rym: I actually enjoy chess problems more than I enjoy chess.

519
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,390
Scott: Yeah.

520
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:31,583
Scott: The only smaller chesses I've seen is like just regular old chess except the pieces are rethemed to be cute.

521
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:34,329
Scott: Like I think I've seen like a Simpsons chess set of that nature.

522
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:36,851
Scott: All right.

523
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:38,414
Scott: So yeah, I think of the day.

524
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:40,418
Scott: So I'll never forget.

525
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:45,708
Scott: when we went to see in New York, we went to see Will Wright talk this in the SimCity creator.

526
00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:46,450
Rym: Oh, yeah.

527
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:55,150
Scott: And in the middle of his talk, we've told the story before, but in the middle of his talk, he just stopped and just was like, all right, time for the Russian space minute.

528
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:59,922
Scott: And he told us a story of the Russian space program of the Soviet space program.

529
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:01,366
Scott: And then he's like, all right, that's over.

530
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:02,870
Scott: And he went picked up right where he left off.

531
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:04,194
Rym: And the story was great.

532
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:09,189
Rym: It involved a pistol, wolves and teeth getting knocked down.

533
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:10,115
Scott: Yeah.

534
00:38:10,196 --> 00:38:11,170
Scott: It was a horrific story.

535
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,809
Rym: It was horrific, but no one died.

536
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,052
Scott: But it was incredible.

537
00:38:14,512 --> 00:38:14,793
Scott: Yeah.

538
00:38:15,574 --> 00:38:18,980
Scott: But anyway, so here is something that's very GeekNights.

539
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:22,486
Scott: You know, we often think, you know, government secrets.

540
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:24,710
Scott: We're always thinking about US government secrets, right?

541
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,855
Scott: I guess occasionally UK government secrets, right?

542
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:32,841
Scott: But you don't often think about like, what secrets does the French government have?

543
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:38,050
Scott: You know, what secrets does the, I don't know, the Brazilian government have?

544
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,326
Scott: I'd really love to know what the Brazilian CIA equivalent has in their secret vault.

545
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:43,350
Scott: What kind of hidden knowledge.

546
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:48,916
Scott: And maybe that's just because it probably largely because of, you know, US centrism.

547
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:49,817
Scott: Right.

548
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:56,928
Scott: But even so, I, you know, I think people are, you know, when you think about government secrets, you're thinking about US government secrets.

549
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,530
Scott: They're the ones who know about the aliens.

550
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:02,370
Scott: It's not the Norwegian government that's hiding the secret alien info.

551
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:04,092
Rym: I don't know.

552
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:10,470
Rym: I just, I watched recently an old Unsolved Mysteries and one of the big ones was the Belgian government is covering up the UFOs.

553
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:11,791
Scott: Nice.

554
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:12,552
Scott: That would be awesome.

555
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:13,233
Scott: I'd love to see.

556
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:22,147
Scott: Anyway, but here we have, you know, in the US more recently, you know, not more recently, but over time that things become declassified, right?

557
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,810
Scott: And we find out about them and it's pretty cool.

558
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:30,636
Scott: Even in, apparently, Russia, classified things can get declassified.

559
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:41,046
Scott: And here are documents of declassified Russian space program things, not just rockets, but also space weapons.

560
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:45,890
Scott: These are things that the Soviet space program was actually working on or made.

561
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,333
Scott: And now it's declassified and released.

562
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:51,558
Scott: And here it is for your perusal, real stuff.

563
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:53,620
Rym: Fighting orbital laser station.

564
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,161
Rym: Here we go.

565
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:56,184
Scott: Probably not made up.

566
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:57,105
Scott: Right.

567
00:39:57,966 --> 00:39:59,208
Scott: Definitely worth a look.

568
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:00,149
Scott: Fake or real.

569
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:00,990
Scott: The spiral.

570
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,651
Scott: Yeah.

571
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:05,634
Scott: The aesthetic is A+ no matter what.

572
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:10,741
Rym: Especially the ones where there's a photo of the prototype or the actual thing in some cases.

573
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:11,803
Scott: Yep.

574
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:13,705
Scott: So that's my thing of the day.

575
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:14,527
Rym: That's pretty good stuff.

576
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:16,850
Scott: Declassified Russian space program biz.

577
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:24,315
Rym: In the meta moment, GeekNights book club book that I'm feeling inklings toward reading the tale of game.

578
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:24,736
Scott: Same.

579
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:25,356
Scott: Same.

580
00:40:25,517 --> 00:40:26,457
Scott: Because it's getting cold.

581
00:40:26,477 --> 00:40:27,899
Scott: We've said that for a few weeks now.

582
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:31,582
Rym: Yeah, but I finished those two nonfiction books I kept saying I was working on.

583
00:40:32,242 --> 00:40:37,066
Rym: And I had this sudden urge to read some science fiction.

584
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:41,050
Rym: And I thought that I said, Whoa, it's time to read fiction again.

585
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,512
Scott: But not, but not, not the first fiction.

586
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:45,932
Rym: Yeah.

587
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:47,253
Rym: I mean, I'm going to go read the first fiction.

588
00:40:47,954 --> 00:40:48,914
Scott: The first fiction ever.

589
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:51,816
Scott: Because the book club book is the tale of Genji.

590
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:56,580
Scott: Literally the first novel ever written by humans in the history of humans.

591
00:40:57,841 --> 00:40:58,261
Scott: Period.

592
00:40:58,561 --> 00:40:58,841
Scott: Yeah.

593
00:40:59,142 --> 00:40:59,702
Scott: Undisputed.

594
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:01,183
Scott: No one's like arguing with that either.

595
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:02,304
Scott: It's like it's the first novel.

596
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:02,684
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:41:02,704 --> 00:41:07,047
Scott: There's older writings like, you know, the Iliad or the Odyssey, but those weren't novels.

598
00:41:07,347 --> 00:41:08,908
Scott: So they don't, they're not the first novel.

599
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:09,889
Scott: They were poems.

600
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,010
Scott: Deal with it.

601
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,693
Rym: Otherwise stay tuned for whatever stuff we get up to online.

602
00:41:15,214 --> 00:41:17,636
Rym: Follow us on all the internet places.

603
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:21,880
Rym: Check out our discord, check out these live streams and stay tuned.

604
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:28,687
Rym: A lot of the big projects that we keep deferring will probably get undiffered at some point in a post COVID world.

605
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,210
Rym: But it's just too much of a pain in the ass to record video separately right now.

606
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,791
Rym: So yeah, we'll get right into it.

607
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:39,374
Rym: We, uh, there's a lot, we haven't watched any new anime.

608
00:41:39,694 --> 00:41:42,136
Rym: Scott's not watching the animated shows that I'm watching.

609
00:41:43,356 --> 00:41:43,537
Scott: Nope.

610
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:45,738
Rym: You really should catch up on DuckTales.

611
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,279
Scott: I'm going to wait.

612
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:48,460
Scott: It's DuckTales is go.

613
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,741
Scott: So that's one of the things I want to talk about.

614
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:50,762
Scott: This is going to be over soon.

615
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:51,642
Scott: Right.

616
00:41:52,163 --> 00:41:54,604
Scott: And as soon as that show is over, I'm probably going to go watch all of it.

617
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:55,025
Scott: Yeah.

618
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,526
Rym: And I'm watching a lot of disenchantment.

619
00:41:56,566 --> 00:42:02,250
Rym: I think there is going to be a season four so I can talk about it in the context of this episode, but take it away.

620
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:02,670
Scott: Yeah.

621
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:03,611
Scott: So yeah.

622
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:10,436
Scott: Uh, I said, Hey, you know, there's nothing that we've both seen to talk about and we can't think of any general topics to talk about.

623
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:14,578
Scott: Let's talk about what's coming that we haven't seen.

624
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,299
Scott: Right.

625
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:26,887
Scott: You know, early in the year we could, when we did, you know, wrap up of the previous decade, we could have easily copped out and gotten four easy episodes of like predict the next year, you know, forward, right.

626
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:29,168
Scott: The next year, the next decade in tech games.

627
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:29,909
Scott: Right.

628
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:31,290
Scott: So this is sort of that.

629
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:35,732
Scott: This is, Hey, let's look at the animations that have been announced.

630
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:43,538
Scott: We know are coming and we are interested in seeing and talk about what they are and why we're interested in seeing them.

631
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:53,744
Scott: And that way you can know what sort of, basically all of these things are going to have GeekNights episodes coming up in the near ish future the next year or year and a half, maybe two year.

632
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:54,445
Scott: Right.

633
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,346
Scott: Uh, so yeah, let's talk about some DuckTales.

634
00:42:56,366 --> 00:43:01,910
Scott: We did an episode on the DuckTales, the new show, uh, when it first came out, we watched like the first few episodes.

635
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,993
Scott: And it's on D plus, I think.

636
00:43:05,053 --> 00:43:05,253
Scott: Right.

637
00:43:05,473 --> 00:43:05,673
Rym: Yep.

638
00:43:05,853 --> 00:43:08,116
Rym: I, uh, I've seen the first two seasons.

639
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:11,059
Rym: The third season is not on the D plus yet.

640
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:11,719
Scott: Yeah.

641
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,581
Scott: However many seasons there are.

642
00:43:13,922 --> 00:43:17,786
Scott: the ending of the show is going to be like a month from now.

643
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,990
Scott: on March 15th, they're going to put out the final final ending part.

644
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,472
Scott: I don't, I think it might, I heard it might be a little longer than a normal thought.

645
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:27,274
Scott: Maybe like it's going to be a big end.

646
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:30,036
Scott: It's going to be a big ending like the end.

647
00:43:30,136 --> 00:43:30,376
Scott: Right.

648
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:32,557
Scott: So I'm going to wait for that.

649
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:37,281
Scott: And then I'm probably just going to go back and just go right through the whole thing and all in one go.

650
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:38,682
Rym: Yeah.

651
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,663
Scott: A few episodes, a few episodes a day till it's done.

652
00:43:40,783 --> 00:43:43,505
Rym: Season two is pretty great.

653
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:47,748
Rym: The show, like you saw season, like you saw some of it, right?

654
00:43:47,768 --> 00:43:50,610
Rym: Like the first couple of three episodes, maybe.

655
00:43:50,810 --> 00:44:04,909
Rym: So you know how it was like funny, but, and like really like true to the ducks, but also like a little bit dangerous, a little bit dark, the darkness, like on the edges of the things they show on screen only increases as the show goes on.

656
00:44:06,451 --> 00:44:08,293
Scott: Any sort of a gravity falls fashion?

657
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:12,276
Rym: In some cases, it actually gets a little darker than that.

658
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:26,550
Rym: Like in the second season, I would say in nearly every episode, at least one thing happens where the characters, like it happens and the characters react to it appropriately because it's a, it's a serious thing that happened.

659
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:38,050
Rym: But the implication of the thing that those characters just recognized is far more horrifying than like the show got into because something interrupts them and they move on.

660
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,659
Rym: The implications of what happens in every episode get increasingly terrifying as the show goes on.

661
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,370
Rym: I don't want to spoil anything, but there's a moment where a character dies and it's a, it's a whole thing.

662
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:49,651
Rym: Whoa.

663
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:53,099
Scott: All right, well let's focus on the things that are completely not out yet, right?

664
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:56,127
Scott: So we already talked about Earwig, right?

665
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:57,250
Scott: And how it's probably meh.

666
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:04,918
Scott: But Miyazaki still is working on some mysterious movie that'll be out when it's out, who knows when.

667
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,623
Scott: And you know, I'm not too sure.

668
00:45:08,703 --> 00:45:13,408
Scott: Like is it, is it going to be like, you can never believe him when he says it's the final one.

669
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:14,790
Scott: He's cried wolf too many times.

670
00:45:14,931 --> 00:45:19,090
Rym: No, like I get the impression the dude literally wants to die in the middle of his masterpiece.

671
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:24,402
Scott: Yeah, I think he doesn't want to, you know, he still smokes like a chimney as far as I'm aware, right?

672
00:45:24,462 --> 00:45:27,530
Scott: So it's like, uh, I don't know how he's even still alive.

673
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,479
Rym: It must be the monkey, monkey spa.

674
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:31,269
Rym: You will live to make your greatest work.

675
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,091
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

676
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:34,954
Scott: But yeah, it's the title of it though.

677
00:45:35,034 --> 00:45:36,095
Scott: How do you live?

678
00:45:36,716 --> 00:45:37,097
Scott: really?

679
00:45:37,177 --> 00:45:40,702
Scott: is the kind of title you give to like, you know, something like that.

680
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:46,530
Scott: Like a, like a grand philosophical thesis to end your overall, right?

681
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,390
Scott: It's like, you know, that's the kind of title you give to something that's like your last work.

682
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:52,350
Rym: I already felt like the wind rise.

683
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:52,731
Scott: I don't know.

684
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:56,897
Scott: I don't know what the Japanese, I don't know what the Japanese title would be of how do you live.

685
00:45:56,917 --> 00:46:05,110
Scott: I don't know if it's a direct translation or not, but, um, but yeah, you know, it's got the, it's like, I'm definitely going to see it whenever it comes.

686
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:11,299
Scott: If it comes, if he doesn't make it and it and finish it, will it be finished?

687
00:46:11,399 --> 00:46:12,881
Scott: I'm going to lean towards.

688
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:13,222
Scott: No.

689
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:17,568
Scott: Um, if he does finish it, does he make something else?

690
00:46:17,668 --> 00:46:18,309
Scott: I lean towards.

691
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:18,590
Scott: Yes.

692
00:46:23,111 --> 00:46:24,233
Scott: But yeah, it's like, who knows?

693
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:26,617
Scott: Like, you know, I guess there's nothing to know about it.

694
00:46:26,637 --> 00:46:33,929
Scott: It's just, you can't not mention that as the greatest looming coming animation that's in the world.

695
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:34,490
Scott: Right?

696
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,091
Rym: Yeah.

697
00:46:35,654 --> 00:46:37,603
Scott: Um, so let's talk about something.

698
00:46:37,643 --> 00:46:39,050
Scott: We can talk a lot more about.

699
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,073
Rym: I didn't realize he announced this back in 2017.

700
00:46:43,073 --> 00:46:43,333
Rym: Oh yeah.

701
00:46:43,453 --> 00:46:48,636
Rym: When he announced that he came out of retirement because I realized we, you still haven't seen the wind rises.

702
00:46:48,717 --> 00:46:52,219
Scott: You said I somehow I haven't seen, I've seen most, but not all.

703
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:53,560
Scott: That is one of the ones I haven't seen.

704
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,861
Scott: Did you see princess Kaguya?

705
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:56,642
Scott: Cause I remember I, we, I went to see that and you didn't.

706
00:46:56,662 --> 00:46:57,843
Rym: That's the only one I haven't seen.

707
00:46:58,343 --> 00:47:00,024
Scott: See this, you know, you haven't seen them all.

708
00:47:00,064 --> 00:47:01,245
Scott: It's just 90% of them.

709
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:07,049
Rym: The wind rises is I, I feel like he wanted that one to be his last film.

710
00:47:07,169 --> 00:47:08,430
Rym: considering the subject matter.

711
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:09,751
Scott: Yeah.

712
00:47:10,012 --> 00:47:12,976
Scott: I know the subject matter and it definitely feels like a, you know.

713
00:47:13,277 --> 00:47:13,577
Rym: Yeah.

714
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,368
Rym: So science Saru of course is working on something because they're just, they're just going at 11 all the time.

715
00:47:20,388 --> 00:47:21,610
Scott: The, the, the Inu-O.

716
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,431
Rym: Yeah.

717
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:27,358
Scott: So we saw a little bit of work for this during Annecy.

718
00:47:27,399 --> 00:47:29,722
Scott: There was like some preview stuff about it.

719
00:47:29,802 --> 00:47:30,023
Scott: Right.

720
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:34,069
Scott: But it wasn't anything more than like some, you know, there, there wasn't much to go on.

721
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:34,490
Scott: Right.

722
00:47:35,393 --> 00:47:40,268
Scott: Um, but regardless, obviously it's exciting just based on who's making it.

723
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:40,810
Scott: Right.

724
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:42,411
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:44,361
Rym: Science Saru, bat in a thousand.

726
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:46,010
Rym: Everything they've made is just solid gold.

727
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:47,030
Scott: Yeah.

728
00:47:47,131 --> 00:48:00,248
Scott: And it's like, you know, even though, um, uh, it was, oh, isn't this the story of, uh, It's the child born horrific and they cover whatever his deformities are with a mask?

729
00:48:00,649 --> 00:48:01,010
Rym: and he did.

730
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:10,850
Scott: I was thinking of, um, the, the, uh, Tezuka one where the guy has like no body parts and he gets his body parts back.

731
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:11,258
Rym: Oh yeah.

732
00:48:11,279 --> 00:48:11,749
Rym: It's not that.

733
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,132
Scott: It's not that one.

734
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:13,853
Scott: It's a different one.

735
00:48:13,873 --> 00:48:16,698
Scott: Uh, but it's sorta, I guess in that same category.

736
00:48:17,038 --> 00:48:17,319
Scott: Right.

737
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,910
Scott: Um, anyway, but yeah, that's, uh, you know, that's what that is.

738
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:24,170
Scott: Yeah.

739
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:25,695
Rym: I'm looking, I'm looking forward to it.

740
00:48:26,498 --> 00:48:26,659
Scott: Yeah.

741
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:27,401
Scott: All right.

742
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:29,067
Scott: Here's something we can talk a lot about.

743
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:29,950
Scott: that's coming, right?

744
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,357
Scott: So since, right.

745
00:48:32,597 --> 00:48:36,890
Scott: I remember when we were still going to Otakon, it must've been the late two thousands, right?

746
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:38,813
Scott: Eight or nine or something like that.

747
00:48:38,913 --> 00:48:47,310
Scott: And the first evangelical movie, not the, um, you know, I guess the first evangelical movie was some technically like, you know, death and rebirth.

748
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,773
Scott: They're one of the end of evangelical.

749
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:50,537
Scott: One of those are technically movies, right?

750
00:48:50,577 --> 00:48:53,283
Scott: But you know, the remake movies, right?

751
00:48:53,283 --> 00:48:56,290
Scott: 1.0 to one, whatever they're all called, right?

752
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:01,498
Rym: You cannot do whatever you cannot finish this remake.

753
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,700
Rym: Yeah.

754
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:08,670
Scott: All of those, that whole series, even one, I have not watched even one second of them.

755
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:15,370
Scott: All I know is that the remakes of evangelical, the animation has, I guess, been updated with newer techniques and technologies.

756
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,295
Scott: Uh, there's that, there's that new character pilot who's purple, right?

757
00:49:19,395 --> 00:49:30,470
Rym: Like that, the fact that they added that character instead of just doing the expansion of the characters that were originally intended for the original anime was what gave me pause to even like watch them in the first place.

758
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:31,110
Scott: Yeah.

759
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:37,160
Scott: There were other students in that classroom, uh, in the original TV series that would have piloted, you know, anyway.

760
00:49:38,102 --> 00:49:43,370
Scott: Uh, but yeah, so my plan from that, even at Otakon, I had the opportunity to watch like the U S premiere.

761
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,931
Scott: I was right outside the room.

762
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:48,034
Scott: I could have just walked into the room and watched it for $0, right?

763
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,036
Scott: Money I already paid to get there.

764
00:49:50,297 --> 00:49:51,077
Scott: I chose not to.

765
00:49:51,117 --> 00:49:51,818
Scott: I said, you know what?

766
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:52,579
Scott: This is 1.0.

767
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:59,906
Scott: Uh, there's been this pattern where they've released 1.0 and then they updated it a little bit to be like 1.0 V2.

768
00:50:00,006 --> 00:50:04,050
Scott: It's like, and then they did two and then they did two and then they updated that one.

769
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:10,370
Rym: Never forget when we watched Sailor Moon Crystal, they didn't even have the faces finished on the fucking characters when it first aired.

770
00:50:11,271 --> 00:50:11,491
Scott: Yeah.

771
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:17,264
Scott: It's like they're like each of these movies has been released and then had a second like director's cut.

772
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:19,830
Scott: ish updated release afterwards.

773
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,665
Rym: Yo dog, I'm downloading Evangelion 4.4 dash one beta.

774
00:50:24,631 --> 00:50:24,851
Scott: Right.

775
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:25,352
Scott: Exactly.

776
00:50:25,372 --> 00:50:29,018
Scott: So the w the final one, supposedly they say that it's done.

777
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:32,324
Scott: I think we talked about that in a news item and that one is called 3.0 plus 1.0.

778
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:35,790
Scott: So it's not called 4.0.

779
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:35,991
Scott: Right.

780
00:50:36,091 --> 00:50:37,392
Scott: It's called 3.0 plus 1.0.

781
00:50:37,392 --> 00:50:44,238
Scott: Um, but you know, there's going to be a 3.0 plus 1.0 director's cut, right?

782
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:57,410
Scott: And when that comes out, right, I believe I actually probably foolishly believe that the second updated release of this soon to be released movie will be the final one in the series.

783
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:07,024
Scott: And then at that point I will watch all in a row, the only the director's cut ones, all four of them, one, two, three, four, and I'm going to be a bit bam, bam, bam, bam.

784
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:09,187
Scott: And then we could probably get four GeekNights episodes out of that.

785
00:51:09,207 --> 00:51:10,970
Scott: We'll probably do a whole two months.

786
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,329
Rym: Cause you know how much we love the original Evangelion.

787
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:14,332
Scott: Right.

788
00:51:14,433 --> 00:51:16,609
Scott: You know, even though not everyone else loves it all, but we do.

789
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:21,502
Rym: Our point we made repeatedly is you don't have to love it, but you got to respect what it was.

790
00:51:21,522 --> 00:51:23,909
Rym: There's a reason why people like us keep talking about it.

791
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:24,591
Scott: Right.

792
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:27,434
Scott: So the that's going to happen.

793
00:51:27,474 --> 00:51:34,082
Scott: So the news, the most recent news I've heard is that the, the 3.0 plus 1.0, which I'm is not out yet.

794
00:51:34,202 --> 00:51:40,390
Scott: And I'm not going to watch till it has a director's cut is apparently like over like two and a half hours long.

795
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:45,866
Rym: It's like, I mean, it says runtime theatrical edition of the whole thing, 556 minutes.

796
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:49,603
Scott: Oh, for all of them combined.

797
00:51:50,248 --> 00:51:50,450
Scott: Yeah.

798
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,749
Rym: Uncut edition, 309 minutes, but it's ongoing.

799
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:58,430
Scott: So how, how many, what's the combined minutes of the 26 episode TV series?

800
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:03,056
Rym: 24 times 26 comparable.

801
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:08,654
Scott: It's like 624.

802
00:52:08,654 --> 00:52:11,570
Scott: It's almost as long as watching the whole TV series.

803
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:12,430
Rym: We watched that the whole weekend.

804
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:18,727
Scott: It is no surprise that they can fit the same amount of material in there, especially since they don't need like recappy kind of stuff.

805
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:18,948
Scott: Right.

806
00:52:18,968 --> 00:52:19,610
Scott: Cause it's movies.

807
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:26,307
Scott: Um, yeah, I am, I am actually have been looking forward to watching all those for like a decade, good or bad.

808
00:52:26,367 --> 00:52:27,270
Scott: I'm just not doing it.

809
00:52:27,551 --> 00:52:29,150
Scott: And like, like same with DuckTales, not doing it.

810
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:35,530
Rym: I have to just because I enjoy the, like what Evangelion was and I want to see if they add more to it.

811
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,430
Rym: Like if there's more to take away from this compared to the original.

812
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:39,211
Scott: Yeah.

813
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:48,010
Scott: I'll probably, I imagine I'll still come out of it thinking that the original is the original and this is just some other deal, but you know, it's still interesting to see how they do differently.

814
00:52:48,110 --> 00:53:00,050
Scott: What they thought needed changing, what they, you know, if there's any, you know, it could, they could reveal information that is true of the original right in this remake, even though it's a different timeline situation.

815
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,552
Rym: Well, the manga kind of did that.

816
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:13,550
Rym: One thing is if you are seeking to engage more with what the original anime did, like if you want to just to go deeper on those themes, you can, you can't really go much better than the manga.

817
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,970
Rym: The Evangelion manga is fucking fantastic.

818
00:53:17,451 --> 00:53:19,716
Rym: I didn't even read it all because it was coming out so slowly.

819
00:53:19,736 --> 00:53:26,030
Rym: I read a bunch of it and I had like, it's near the top of my queue to read that entire manga start to finish.

820
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:27,171
Scott: Yep.

821
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:32,670
Scott: So let's talk about the thing we talked about in the news, which is Belle, the new Hosoda movie, right?

822
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,655
Scott: So Mamoru Hosoda, right?

823
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:38,426
Scott: Summer Wars, Boy and the Beast, right?

824
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:39,570
Scott: You know, Wolf Children.

825
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:40,562
Rym: Batting a thousand.

826
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:42,332
Scott: Right.

827
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:47,630
Scott: It's not, not all of these movies are like S tier, but there are, none of them are bad.

828
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:48,829
Rym: They're all A at least.

829
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,390
Scott: Yeah, they're all like pretty good.

830
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,123
Rym: I think Summer Wars might be S tier.

831
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:55,310
Scott: Summer Wars was just- Summer Wars is I think S tier.

832
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:56,086
Rym: Like what a chef kiss.

833
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:58,830
Scott: That's definitely my favorite of them for sure.

834
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:09,290
Rym: What I'm excited about with Belle is that it's diving, it's going deep into that same kind of world where everyone is online and like the Uber MMO slash social network to rule them all.

835
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:10,973
Scott: Something like that.

836
00:54:11,133 --> 00:54:17,890
Scott: The only thing we know about this, right, is what the imagery that we've seen in this trailer and the preview image, which is also part of the trailer.

837
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:23,470
Scott: And it's like, it just looks, it gives you some, you know, Hosoda vibes from Summer Wars.

838
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:27,209
Scott: It also gives me some Satoshi Kon like Paprika kind of vibes.

839
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:34,350
Scott: And it's just like, you know, like this, like, you know, creating some sort of stunning fantastical world, right?

840
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:35,315
Scott: Oh, yes.

841
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,490
Scott: Mirai was also a Hosoda movie, right?

842
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,009
Scott: I think you can just watch Mirai on Netflix now.

843
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:41,550
Scott: Mirai was great.

844
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:43,704
Scott: It's on some of the streaming service.

845
00:54:43,725 --> 00:54:44,330
Scott: I don't know which ones.

846
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:49,610
Rym: But this one, the Japanese title of this one is The Dragon and the Freckled Princess.

847
00:54:51,071 --> 00:54:51,670
Scott: Ooh, interesting.

848
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:56,130
Rym: It's definitely, if you look at the teaser, there's big Beauty and the Beast vibes.

849
00:54:56,991 --> 00:55:07,230
Scott: There is definitely some sort of fantasy element mixed in with this sort of, you know, somewhat vaguely utopian cyberspace.

850
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,004
Rym: Like the main character meets this, like, dragon person online.

851
00:55:11,044 --> 00:55:12,530
Rym: as far, like, as best we can see.

852
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:19,050
Rym: There's something about, like, the studio said something to the effect of the show is about interspecies communication.

853
00:55:21,115 --> 00:55:22,768
Rym: And we don't know anything else about it.

854
00:55:23,732 --> 00:55:30,289
Scott: No, no, it gives me a little bit of, you know, just the vibes I get from what we've seen is a little bit of Laputa.

855
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:35,830
Scott: But not Laputa in the sense of, oh, people uncovering some, you know, lost thing.

856
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:40,309
Scott: But, like, that lost civilization in the sky at its height, right?

857
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:44,446
Scott: And you're seeing what's happening there, which is what I always want to see.

858
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,190
Scott: I always ask for that.

859
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,730
Scott: Don't give me the story of the ruined kingdom, right?

860
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,890
Scott: Show me the kingdom when it was the best awesome kingdom.

861
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:54,990
Rym: But then that story is likely going to be, and it falls into ruin.

862
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,730
Scott: No, how about the awesome kingdom becomes awesomer?

863
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:06,170
Rym: From one frame, there's definitely a sea of people basically adding the dragon, telling them that they don't have any reason to exist.

864
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:13,690
Rym: It looks like it's fairly existential, and from what little we've seen, the animation just looks beautiful.

865
00:56:16,352 --> 00:56:16,599
Scott: Hmm.

866
00:56:16,825 --> 00:56:16,969
Scott: Alright.

867
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:22,850
Rym: Let's see, I am still... So, does a Disney movie come in, like, imminently, Raya and the Last Dragon?

868
00:56:23,751 --> 00:56:27,250
Scott: Okay, I haven't heard about that until you mentioned it earlier today, so tell me about it.

869
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:37,630
Rym: So it looks like a standard, like, Disney movie, but the thing that looks really cool about it is, it looks like it's about a woman who, like, meets a dragon who might be the last dragon, like, Dragonheart style.

870
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,030
Rym: But the dragon's character design...

871
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:40,910
Scott: The story I've heard before.

872
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,536
Rym: Looks really fun.

873
00:56:43,697 --> 00:56:48,508
Rym: Like, the dragon looks a lot more like a dragon from, like, a My Little Pony type world, but 3DCG.

874
00:56:50,191 --> 00:56:53,243
Scott: Is it going to be, like, Aladdin Genie kind of dragon?

875
00:56:53,263 --> 00:56:54,910
Scott: That kind of character?

876
00:56:55,491 --> 00:57:01,630
Rym: No, it's more like the dragon, she is just not that good at being a dragon and trying not to get killed by people.

877
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,290
Scott: So a combination of, uh, Dragonheart and how to train your dragon?

878
00:57:06,852 --> 00:57:09,170
Rym: Uh, yeah, I get both of those vibes combined.

879
00:57:10,454 --> 00:57:11,429
Scott: So much dragon action.

880
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,870
Rym: There's a lot of dragon action right now.

881
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,761
Scott: There's not a lot you knew you could do with dragons.

882
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:15,968
Scott: You gotta be pretty good to...

883
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:20,229
Rym: Well, I mean, we had Wolf, like, Hot Wolfman was the theme for a while now.

884
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,070
Rym: And now we're edging into dragon action.

885
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,510
Rym: We got the dragon in the belly and the dragon in this.

886
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:29,661
Scott: We really need someone to go, we've seen, there's owls, right?

887
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:32,450
Scott: There's that whole series of movies, I haven't watched any of them.

888
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,170
Scott: Like, the Kahool or whatever it's called.

889
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:34,810
Rym: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

890
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,008
Scott: The only reason I know those exist is because I've seen them train.

891
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:38,755
Rym: The owl thing.

892
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,009
Rym: You've gotta watch the owl house.

893
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:48,130
Scott: Yeah, what I'm saying is, like, we have owl things, we have dragon things, we have wolf things, right?

894
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:50,870
Scott: We need some other animal action, right?

895
00:57:51,331 --> 00:57:57,409
Scott: We have some insect things, there's like ants and bugs, and there's some fish things, we got Nemo.

896
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:00,670
Scott: But there are so many animals in the world.

897
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,410
Rym: Chicken run, we had a lot of farm animal stuff over the years.

898
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,890
Scott: Alright, we got dogs and cats are covered, right?

899
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:11,930
Scott: Let's see, we got Bambi, kind of animal...

900
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,249
Rym: Horses and ponies have had their day.

901
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,710
Scott: Birds, is there like a bird thing?

902
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:17,429
Scott: Ducks, duck tails!

903
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,829
Scott: That's a duck thing, yeah, okay.

904
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,590
Rym: There's been a duck tail.

905
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:22,910
Scott: Has every animal been turned into a thing?

906
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:27,249
Scott: And I just keep thinking there must be, there's a jellyfish, the jellyfish show.

907
00:58:27,914 --> 00:58:28,750
Rym: Princess jellyfish.

908
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,990
Scott: There's a penguin thing, but there's no... Princess jellyfish is not about jellyfish.

909
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,819
Rym: It's about aliens.

910
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:35,550
Rym: that, yeah, anyway.

911
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:38,930
Scott: I'm talking about, yeah, I'm talking about literal, something about literal jellyfish.

912
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,510
Scott: The same way that, you know, Bambi is about deer.

913
00:58:41,731 --> 00:58:42,970
Scott: Make a story about jellyfish.

914
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,048
Rym: Yeah, they're adjacent in Ponyo.

915
00:58:45,912 --> 00:58:48,149
Rym: Arguably because of what Ponyo's about.

916
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:50,010
Scott: Maybe.

917
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:50,643
Rym: Yep.

918
00:58:52,332 --> 00:58:55,230
Scott: Alright, fine, there's no animals left to go on.

919
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:56,110
Rym: Oh, the listener came through.

920
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,809
Rym: Capybaras deserve feature films.

921
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,084
Scott: There you go.

922
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:09,070
Rym: I want to see a slice of life anime that is just Capybaras chilling and solving problems for their community.

923
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:17,950
Scott: This is actually a pretty good, like, almost Jackbox game where it's like, name an animal, then you gotta name an artwork in which that animal appears.

924
00:59:19,531 --> 00:59:26,490
Rym: Then you do the chain, and the next person has to name a different animal that's in that artwork, and then the next person has to name a different artwork that has that next animal.

925
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:27,554
Scott: Ooh.

926
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:29,430
Scott: That's a real good chain game.

927
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,907
Scott: Alright, so I'll start with, like, uh, you know, uh...

928
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,049
Rym: Come on, sorry, Babe!

929
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:38,989
Scott: Well, Babe has a pig in it.

930
00:59:39,155 --> 00:59:39,430
Scott: Alright.

931
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:44,690
Scott: And Babe also has, I guess there must be a cow in there somewhere, it's a farm, right?

932
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,098
Rym: Are you 100% sure?

933
00:59:47,002 --> 00:59:47,086
Scott: No.

934
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,470
Scott: I haven't seen Babe in 100, since it came out.

935
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:51,749
Scott: I saw it one time.

936
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,710
Scott: We need a mechanic, we can challenge the person.

937
00:59:53,710 --> 01:00:02,150
Scott: I mean, also, in my brain, right, it's like, uh, you know, Babe and Charlotte's Web occupy a lot of the same space.

938
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:07,610
Scott: Obviously, the final scene with, like, some pig written on the web is from Charlotte's Web.

939
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:13,068
Scott: But the entire rest of the story in both of those is merged, other than the ending and the presence of the spider.

940
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:22,990
Scott: The spider parts are clearly in the Charlotte's Web zone, but all the rest of the parts of both of those things are combined into one brain space.

941
01:00:23,711 --> 01:00:24,793
Scott: So, alright, there's probably

942
01:00:24,813 --> 01:00:44,990
Rym: a ton of things we didn't even talk about, but there's also all the things that are just continuing that we've watched some of, that we want to watch more of, and I think I realized, I tried to stack rank, and it was actually hard to stack rank for myself, of all the things, all the animation I'm watching that is currently paused, which one I want most.

943
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:51,150
Scott: It's gotta be Adventure Time movies, right, because we're doing GeekNights episodes on those, I'm watching those immediately if they appear.

944
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,429
Scott: But I had, like, what else?

945
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:54,175
Rym: What am I looking forward to more?

946
01:00:54,456 --> 01:00:59,250
Rym: The next Adventure Time, which is Peppermint Butler going to wizard school, which puts it way up there.

947
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:04,230
Scott: Nothing can, what can possibly beat that, unless the Ghibli movie gets released tomorrow.

948
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,609
Rym: For me, personally, Castle Vassal.

949
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:10,610
Scott: I like the Castle Vassal a lot, but I don't think it beats Peppermint Butler going to wizard school.

950
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:17,470
Rym: I think this might be a Roman Scott epic, because for me, Castlevania, like, digs back to the first anime I ever saw.

951
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:20,410
Scott: You are, yeah, you are a vampire person.

952
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:26,383
Rym: Yeah, Vampire Hunter D was, like, is probably the reason I live here today.

953
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:29,490
Rym: Like, it set me on the course that put me in front of this microphone.

954
01:01:30,011 --> 01:01:35,370
Scott: Listen, there is no question that the day that Castlevania season drops on Netflix, I will watch all of it, right?

955
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:40,270
Scott: There is no question whatsoever, right, and this is someone who puts everything in the queue, right?

956
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:41,647
Rym: That is true.

957
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,189
Scott: That is true, right?

958
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:49,810
Scott: But at the same time, there is no question that if the Peppermint Butler drops, right, I'll be watching that on the same day.

959
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:55,970
Scott: Right, that I can pirate it, or if I somehow happen to have an HBO, I might have an HBO Max subscription even, or who knows.

960
01:01:56,470 --> 01:02:03,350
Scott: But if they were to drop on the same day, and I finish my work, and it's time to go watch, I'm going to watch Pee Butt first.

961
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:12,050
Rym: Fuck, I realized I would too, but only because Pee Butt is just one thing, and then I can binge on all of Castlevania uninterrupted, because there's a whole ass season of that coming.

962
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:14,910
Scott: If they drop on a Saturday morning, and I have all fucking day.

963
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:15,590
Rym: They're all getting watched.

964
01:02:16,392 --> 01:02:19,659
Scott: I'm watching Pee Butt first, and then I'm watching Cast... Right?

965
01:02:19,821 --> 01:02:20,610
Scott: That's what's going down.

966
01:02:20,691 --> 01:02:23,069
Rym: But right up there is season two of Beastars.

967
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:25,889
Scott: Oh, season two of Beastars is up there.

968
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:29,050
Scott: I don't know if I would watch that immediately, but I would watch it quickly.

969
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:34,870
Rym: I would watch it immediately, but like the first episode, but then I'd do the thing of just watching an episode a week to try to like drag it out.

970
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:41,030
Scott: Okay, there are some other things that if, just Dragon Prince, which I haven't even watched all the Dragon Prince.

971
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:48,810
Rym: Dragon Prince is the only thing of the things we haven't talked about yet that's higher on my list than Dragon Prince is more of the Owl House.

972
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:50,910
Scott: Yeah, I haven't watched any Owl House.

973
01:02:52,114 --> 01:02:52,850
Scott: It's in the queue.

974
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:56,690
Rym: Take Gravity Falls and make it just better and darker.

975
01:02:57,497 --> 01:02:58,110
Scott: Owl House is in the queue.

976
01:02:58,435 --> 01:02:58,770
Rym: And funnier.

977
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:02,370
Scott: I like what's going on there with the owl, but you know.

978
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:07,970
Rym: Yeah, and I know I probably misrepresent how much Hootie features in the Owl House.

979
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,190
Scott: Hootie is a kid's side character.

980
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:21,490
Scott: I'm aware that Hootie is a bit side character because I can see from the screenshots and gifs that Hootie is attached to a door and therefore would only appear in the show when the show is in that house or the Owl House.

981
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:22,909
Rym: Pretty much, and I feel like that is very-.

982
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:30,650
Scott: The rest of the time, I imagine a lot of the show takes place not at the, you know, I guess, what's the word?

983
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:31,032
Rym: The Owl House.

984
01:03:31,093 --> 01:03:32,261
Rym: It's called the Owl House.

985
01:03:32,402 --> 01:03:33,550
Rym: The house is called the Owl House.

986
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:37,350
Scott: What's the word for when some eponymous Owl House, that's the word?

987
01:03:37,551 --> 01:03:40,430
Rym: Nominative determinism for the eponymous Owl House.

988
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:41,590
Scott: That's right.

989
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:49,290
Rym: But I'm actually real excited about Dragon Prince, not just because there's more of it, because I really like it, but because they committed.

990
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:51,710
Rym: It wasn't just announced, oh, they're going to make another season.

991
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:52,328
Scott: A pile of seasons.

992
01:03:52,690 --> 01:04:00,890
Rym: They're going to make all the seasons, as in the original creative vision of what Dragon Prince was supposed to be will complete.

993
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:03,463
Rym: So I don't have to worry about season nonsense.

994
01:04:03,503 --> 01:04:04,850
Rym: The whole story is going to get told.

995
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:08,650
Rym: And honestly, where it ended was a real interesting point.

996
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:16,588
Rym: Like, it escalated rapidly, and if there's going to be this many more seasons, this is like the big epic fantasy that I'm here for.

997
01:04:18,673 --> 01:04:20,429
Scott: Some other things I just want to mention, right?

998
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,814
Scott: So One Punch Man had a second season.

999
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:32,222
Scott: I've only seen the first, but the manga keeps going, so you have to imagine at some point something that popular is going to get- They're not just going to stop.

1000
01:04:32,323 --> 01:04:33,009
Scott: They could, I guess.

1001
01:04:33,831 --> 01:04:37,490
Scott: There have been other anime series, like Hajime no Ippo, they didn't animate the whole manga.

1002
01:04:37,571 --> 01:04:39,989
Scott: They just sort of animated a bunch of it and stopped, and that was it.

1003
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:43,823
Scott: But if they make more One Punch Man, I'm looking forward to that.

1004
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:45,270
Scott: I don't think any has been announced.

1005
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,978
Scott: Similar thing with the Yo-Yo Pedal, right?

1006
01:04:47,998 --> 01:04:51,130
Scott: Yo-Yo Pedal, they animated a whole bunch of the manga, and then they just stopped.

1007
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:57,810
Scott: I don't know if they're waiting for more manga, or if they're just not going to make any more of an anime, and you just got to read the manga to get the rest of the story.

1008
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:02,500
Scott: But if there was more Yo-Yo Pedal anime, I would watch that also.

1009
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,610
Scott: It just hasn't come, or it won't come, who knows.

1010
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:15,182
Rym: So one thing I'm actually- I don't think you've really watched much of it, but Disenchanted, that Matt Groening show, that the reviews- The Fantasy Futurama.

1011
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:15,830
Scott: that's on Netflix.

1012
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,190
Rym: Yeah, the reviews across the board.

1013
01:05:17,312 --> 01:05:17,969
Scott: I know it exists.

1014
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:18,573
Rym: It's okay.

1015
01:05:18,634 --> 01:05:19,158
Rym: It's alright.

1016
01:05:19,238 --> 01:05:19,963
Rym: It's not great.

1017
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:20,829
Rym: It's not bad.

1018
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:26,090
Rym: But I'm watching it now, partly because we got through the queue of all the other animation we wanted to watch.

1019
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:30,350
Rym: And the thing I want to say about it is that I'm actually really looking forward to a fourth season.

1020
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:33,230
Rym: I don't even know for sure if there will be a fourth season.

1021
01:05:33,992 --> 01:05:34,207
Rym: Uh-oh.

1022
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:39,009
Scott: I assume there will, because I- So I'm assuming, I guess, the third season you just watched did not end it.

1023
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:45,170
Rym: So we're not- we're near- we have like two more episodes to go in the third season, and it- Oh, so it could end.

1024
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,634
Rym: You know, so here's the thing.

1025
01:05:46,654 --> 01:05:52,390
Rym: You know those episodes in Evangelion, like near the end, where like the pacing gets really weird?

1026
01:05:52,471 --> 01:05:54,527
Rym: Like the show just really slows down and zooms in?

1027
01:05:55,626 --> 01:05:55,770
Scott: Yeah.

1028
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,690
Rym: Disenchanted kind of did that, like near the end of the third season.

1029
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:07,110
Rym: Like there's a couple episodes where like the pacing gets really, really atypical and odd and slow.

1030
01:06:07,851 --> 01:06:09,870
Rym: And it feels like it's doing something.

1031
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:13,429
Rym: Like it feels like the show's going to try to be more than it appeared to be.

1032
01:06:14,473 --> 01:06:15,989
Rym: And I'm intrigued by this.

1033
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:17,270
Scott: Okay.

1034
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:18,719
Scott: It's also like pretty funny.

1035
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,130
Rym: Like it's a slow burn funny.

1036
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:23,570
Rym: Like it feels very like, okay, it's just Futurama humor.

1037
01:06:23,811 --> 01:06:30,670
Rym: But as it goes on, it kind of builds on itself, and King Zog just gets funnier and funnier and funnier, and I cannot get over that character.

1038
01:06:32,651 --> 01:06:34,234
Scott: Okay, well I can't think of any more.

1039
01:06:34,254 --> 01:06:41,390
Scott: There's no- I'm sure there's plenty of other animation in the world that is being made now announced and unannounced that I'm very interested in and simply unaware of.

1040
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:43,230
Scott: Like Studio Trigger's probably working on something.

1041
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,075
Rym: Oh, the listener comes through.

1042
01:06:45,155 --> 01:06:48,710
Rym: Supposedly there are six intended seasons for Disenchanted.

1043
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:49,870
Scott: Very nice.

1044
01:06:50,011 --> 01:06:51,570
Rym: There's just no date yet for season four.

1045
01:06:52,232 --> 01:06:56,990
Scott: Yeah, Makoto Shinkai's probably working on something again, even though he just released something, right?

1046
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:58,257
Scott: You know, there's stuff coming.

1047
01:06:58,357 --> 01:07:00,228
Scott: We just don't know about it yet, or whatever.

1048
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:03,370
Scott: Or I just personally don't know about it yet, even though it might be public.

1049
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:12,309
Scott: So if you know of other animations' works from anywhere in the world that you're looking forward to, you should let us know so we don't miss them.

1050
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:19,670
Rym: We'll put them in the hopper, because for like five years now we've just been living in this golden age of amazing animation.

1051
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:22,169
Rym: And it doesn't seem like that train is slowing down at all.

1052
01:07:23,431 --> 01:07:24,579
Scott: Uh, thankfully not.

1053
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,170
Scott: So, I'm gonna go eat dinner.

1054
01:07:26,491 --> 01:07:27,477
Rym: I smell some food in there.

1055
01:07:27,537 --> 01:07:29,449
Rym: I'm like salivating right now.

1056
01:07:30,553 --> 01:07:30,887
Scott: Okay, bye.

1057
01:07:32,391 --> 01:07:34,510
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1058
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:39,650
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1059
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:45,070
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1060
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:47,990
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1061
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:52,730
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1062

1063
01:07:57,570 --> 01:08:00,510
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1064
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:03,710
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1065
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:12,910
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Link EG, Graham Finch, you hold the key to my heart.

1066
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:24,130
Rym: Now go through the last year or so of podcasts and make Rym, Sink, Clinton, Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan, Perrin, Review, Mad Bull, 34, Cowards, Dread, Lily, Tenebrae, just like a dude guy.

1067
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:30,310
Rym: Chris Reimer, Finn, Shervin, Vothole, and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1068
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,566
Rym: You might have noticed a while ago that the Patreon for some reason was 18 plus.

1069
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:41,050
Rym: Patreon did that on their own, and when I asked them why, they could not tell me why and they undid it.

1070
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:46,130
Rym: So, we'll see what that was all about, but the Patreon should be more visible just out in the wild now.

1071
01:08:46,991 --> 01:09:05,861
Rym: Otherwise, I'll just leave you with... That school wants you to drink the water.

1072
01:09:06,063 --> 01:09:07,029
Rym: It's bad water.

1073
01:09:07,913 --> 01:09:08,728
Scott: Don't drink the water.

1074
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:09,854
Rym: See?

1075
01:09:10,077 --> 01:09:11,089
Scott: That means good, right?

1076
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:11,654
Scott: Yup.

1077
01:09:13,113 --> 01:09:13,198
Scott: Jake?

1078
01:09:15,733 --> 01:09:16,036
Scott: Jake?

1079
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:17,569
Scott: Why are you making stupid face?

1080
01:09:17,911 --> 01:09:18,569
Rym: Who's Jake?

1081
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:20,430
Rym: Dang it, I knew that water was junk.

1082
01:09:22,171 --> 01:09:47,959
Rym: If you awaken from this illusion and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death, or shall I say, death implies life, you can feel yourself.

1083
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,038
Rym: Not as a stranger in the world.

1084
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:54,385
Rym: Not as something here on... Jake!

1085
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:56,019
Rym: Get out of that water right now!
