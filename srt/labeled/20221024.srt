1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,758
Rym: It's Monday, October 24th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,758 --> 00:00:10,020
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:13,709
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,395
Rym: And this is GeekNights!

5
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:19,970
Rym: Tonight, we are gonna tell you how to not suck at smartphone security.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,727
Scott: Let's do this!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:29,970
Scott: Recently I did an opening bit, and I talked about how Phantom of the Opera was closing, so you went to see it again, at least for me again.

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,110
Scott: Oh yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:37,765
Scott: So, I hadn't been, much like Phantom of the Opera, which I hadn't seen since 1990x, right?

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:47,570
Scott: I hadn't been to the Opera Opera since 1990x, when we went on a middle school band class field trip.

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:57,910
Rym: Last opera I saw was in the year 2000, no, 1999, and we went and saw "Gottur Dammerung", and goddamn do I never want to see that again.

12
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:03,409
Scott: Okay, so, in middle school we saw "Romeo and Juliet", which is alright, you know.

13
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:16,750
Scott: But yeah, we went to the opera again, and we went on the convenient time for us, which was friggin' Saturday at 1 o'clock, which is when the old people go to the opera.

14
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:21,288
Scott: It was all old people, it was like going to a cracker barrel at 4pm.

15
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,320
Rym: I feel like there are exactly two audiences at operas in America.

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,684
Rym: Audience one, old people who have some money.

17
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,470
Rym: Audience two, high school kids on a field trip.

18
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:36,669
Scott: Oh no, there were other young art appreciators there, you know.

19
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:47,410
Scott: But anyway, we went to see the new opera, at least at the Metropolitan Opera, which is "Medea", which I didn't really know the story of.

20
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:57,390
Scott: But it's basically Jason, in Italian, "Gia sone", as in Jason and the Argonauts Jason, that Jason, right?

21
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:01,689
Scott: You know, when he's out adventuring on the Argo with his Argonauts, right?

22
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,938
Scott: Medea, the sorceress lady, helps him out, right?

23
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,630
Scott: And they have babies, and they're having a good time, right?

24
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:08,858
Scott: Yeah.

25
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:15,030
Scott: But the opera starts out, he's back in Corinth, I think Corinth, right?

26
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,960
Rym: Yeah, I think so.

27
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,089
Rym: I hope I'm not wrong.

28
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:19,489
Scott: I think it's Corinth.

29
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,590
Rym: Last time I thought about Medea was high school.

30
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:26,302
Scott: Yeah, and he's there, and he's marrying the king's daughter.

31
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:29,109
Scott: And the king's daughter is like, "I'm worried about

32
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:29,330
Scott: this.".

33
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,589
Scott: She's like, "I love this dude, but I think this is gonna be trouble, especially for that Medea

34
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:33,730
Scott: lady.".

35
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:41,082
Scott: So they're all getting married, and Medea shows up, and she's like, "What the fuck is this bullshit?

36
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:44,149
Scott: You're cheating on me after all I did for you,

37
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:44,630
Scott: asshole?"

38
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:46,013
Scott: Right?

39
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,444
Scott: And they're like, "Get out of here.

40
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:49,087
Scott: You're causing

41
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:49,408
Scott: trouble."

42
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,131
Scott: Right?

43
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:53,899
Scott: The king's like, "You're making a scene.

44
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,965
Scott: I'm gonna exile you.

45
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:56,506
Scott: Get out of here.

46
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:57,730
Scott: You're lucky I didn't just murder

47
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:57,850
Scott: you.".

48
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,715
Scott: And then she's like, "Please.

49
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:02,300
Scott: Alright, I'll give up on Jason.

50
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,884
Scott: He clearly doesn't want me anymore.

51
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:05,348
Scott: Let me see my

52
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:05,769
Scott: children.".

53
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,290
Scott: Right?

54
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:07,754
Scott: Those are my children, too.

55
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:11,843
Scott: And, you know, it's like, "I'm never gonna see them again.

56
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:13,847
Scott: Let me stay for one day.

57
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:14,809
Scott: Let me see my

58
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:15,110
Scott: children.".

59
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:18,808
Scott: They're like, "Alright, you can stay one day and see your

60
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:19,110
Scott: children.".

61
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,458
Scott: And she's like, "Ha ha!

62
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,488
Scott: I'm evil, and I will get revenge

63
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:23,709
Scott: now.".

64
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,390
Rym: Fuck y'all, and everything burns down is what I remember.

65
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,575
Scott: Pretty much, right?

66
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:33,128
Scott: She poisons the lady who's gonna marry Jason, and then kills her own kids.

67
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:33,510
Scott: The end.

68
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:36,283
Rym: I remember the music from that one.

69
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,529
Rym: Most of the operas I remember.

70
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,613
Scott: I listened to it on Spotify.

71
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,859
Scott: It's what I heard on Spotify.

72
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,288
Scott: It's like, first of all, the people performing at the Met, right?

73
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:44,830
Scott: The orchestra.

74
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,434
Scott: You could not fucking tell.

75
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:50,404
Scott: You might as well have just gone to Spotify and pressed play, right?

76
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:52,210
Scott: That's how good they are, right?

77
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:55,358
Scott: It's like, "Are they just playing a

78
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:55,839
Scott: recording?".

79
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,948
Scott: It's like, you'd look, and it's like, "Nope, they're down there playing

80
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,569
Scott: instruments.".

81
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:01,710
Scott: Is he sure it's not a recording?

82
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,879
Scott: But yeah, the opera's a fucking thing, right?

83
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,664
Scott: It's like, they had this giant curtain, right?

84
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,699
Scott: And it's like, you look at it.

85
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,428
Scott: It's got this Medea's face on it.

86
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:18,786
Scott: And I was sitting there looking at it, and I'm thinking, "That curtain's

87
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:18,966
Scott: real.".

88
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,290
Rym: I've always looked like that, from what I remember from high school.

89
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,035
Scott: Yeah, I'm looking at this curtain.

90
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:27,926
Scott: It's fucking enormous, because the opera stage isn't like your usual stage.

91
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,450
Scott: It's tall, right?

92
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,654
Scott: Really tall.

93
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:32,762
Scott: It's probably taller than it is wide, right?

94
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:34,730
Scott: And it's as wide as a normal stage.

95
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:41,089
Scott: It's this enormous curtain, and I'm looking at it, and I'm like, "That curtain is one sheet of material, whatever material it

96
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:41,250
Scott: is.".

97
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,658
Scott: It's got this, you know, picture on it.

98
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:46,242
Scott: that was clearly a painting.

99
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:49,110
Scott: It's like, well, somebody painted the painting.

100
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,490
Scott: They might have painted it digitally, they might have painted it small, and it got blown up, right?

101
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,670
Scott: But if they did it that way, how did they print something that big, right?

102
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:08,209
Scott: I'm like, there might be a printer on Earth that's that big that I don't know about, or some printing technique, or it's folded over, or something that I'm not aware of.

103
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,435
Rym: Oh god, there's a term for it.

104
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:12,250
Rym: I looked it up a long time ago when I was trying to do some stuff for Kinetico.

105
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:22,110
Rym: There's a type of printing, like a class of printing, of I need to print something that's so big, it's special and normal, and there's a small number of companies that are good at it.

106
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,857
Scott: This thing is bigger than outside billboard big, right?

107
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:30,687
Scott: I guess there might be something that prints those big vinyl billboards for the outside.

108
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:36,946
Scott: that might be able to have done this one, but if you put this outside, it would probably be the biggest banner in Times Square.

109
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,090
Scott: It's so large, right?

110
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:42,529
Scott: And I'm like, did somebody just lay that on the ground in a large room and paint it?

111
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,268
Rym: I mean, possibly.

112
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:46,513
Scott: It's possible, right?

113
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:50,261
Scott: I'm not saying that is the truth, right?

114
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:53,287
Scott: But if that is the truth, right?

115
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:54,710
Scott: Jesus Christ.

116
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:03,710
Scott: They're probably going to be doing this opera for many, many years and reusing it, but holy shit.

117
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:14,304
Scott: The opera is only just a few hundred years ago, that was the greatest entertainment option on earth.

118
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:17,390
Scott: There was no video game, there was book, I guess.

119
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:24,324
Scott: There was no movie, there was no rock concert, there was symphony, right?

120
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:27,530
Scott: But the opera was symphony plus singing plus acting, right?

121
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,638
Scott: You had plays, but it was like the triple threat.

122
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:35,530
Scott: It's like all the best entertainment we have invented, all together, all at the same time.

123
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,930
Scott: It's like, you know, the Broadway play, I talked about how much of a pain in the ass that is to do that, right?

124
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,918
Scott: You know, every day, almost every day, sometimes twice a day, right?

125
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:51,870
Scott: The opera is a bigger pain in the ass and they do it much less often.

126
00:06:52,350 --> 00:07:04,090
Rym: Imagine if you were the performers in the French opera, like back in the day, because back then the crowds would not fucking even look at you and they would just be talking loudly over the opera the entire time.

127
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,030
Rym: It was just a social event and the entire opera was kind of just in the background.

128
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:14,861
Scott: And also, the other thing is this particular opera, it's not a well-balanced part.

129
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:16,224
Scott: distribution, right?

130
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:19,729
Scott: Once Medea shows up, it's almost a one-person show.

131
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,410
Rym: I mean, Don Giovanni, a lot of it is just Don Giovanni singing about Don Giovanni.

132
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:31,470
Scott: Right, it's like there's some other people, but it's like mostly Medea, like she's good, more than half of the, right?

133
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:39,730
Scott: So one person has to sing loud enough for everyone in the opera hall to hear for a couple hours, right?

134
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,456
Scott: And it's like, why is the ticket that much money?

135
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:45,084
Scott: That's why, because who's the fuck is going to do that for less money?

136
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:46,949
Scott: What a pain in the ass.

137
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,485
Scott: But if you've never gone to the opera, just pick one and go.

138
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:51,330
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

139
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:57,687
Rym: Yep, I'm thinking what I actually really want to go see is one of the Italian operas, like let's get some Rossini.

140
00:07:57,747 --> 00:07:58,629
Rym: I got to see what's going on.

141
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,688
Scott: Those are more fun.

142
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,810
Rym: Yeah, like Tancredi or Barbara Seville or I can't name any other Rossini's off the top of my head.

143
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,009
Scott: Verdi, any of the Verdi ones.

144
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,626
Rym: Ah, but all right, I guess we just get into the news.

145
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,410
Rym: So there's a bunch of news around Kakao Talk.

146
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:26,490
Scott: So people don't know, in Korea and other parts of Asia, there's a company, Kakao, K-A-O-K-A-O, right?

147
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:31,463
Scott: And their messenger app, Kakao Talk, is the messenger app.

148
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:33,909
Scott: It is like the number one deal there, right?

149
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,009
Scott: So forget your Facebook messengers and your Wechats and your, what's it called, WhatsApps.

150
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:45,209
Rym: If you're as old as us, think back to like when there was only AIM and ICQ.

151
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,630
Rym: Now imagine if literally everyone in America used AIM and ICQ back then and there was nothing else.

152
00:08:52,630 --> 00:09:00,170
Scott: Yeah, it's like there are other, they do have some other messengers that are somewhat popular like Line and some others and people use iMessage, I guess.

153
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,330
Rym: Well, they're more popular now because of this news.

154
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,046
Scott: Yeah, but Kakao Talk was the number one messenger.

155
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:06,830
Scott: It's a big deal.

156
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:12,506
Rym: So there was a ridiculous outage and I don't even have all the details.

157
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:13,870
Rym: Like I'm going to link to some news stories.

158
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,650
Scott: But we don't speak the languages so it's hard to read all the articles.

159
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,849
Rym: Yep, and the articles in English are on variously not great websites and also...

160
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,709
Scott: And not giving lots of technical details that we would like.

161
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,793
Rym: Yep, exactly.

162
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:28,421
Rym: So I've dug around as best I can.

163
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:30,550
Rym: I'm going to link to a bunch of stories around the details.

164
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,177
Rym: But basically, a bunch of things happened all at once.

165
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:41,410
Rym: As best I can tell, there was a data center outage, possibly caused by something with the batteries.

166
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,364
Rym: So like there was a fire and there was a data center outage for Kakao Talk.

167
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,069
Rym: So it went down.

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:57,910
Rym: That going down is kind of like the equivalent of if, well, you know, it's not anymore because if the phone system went down in the US, a lot of people wouldn't notice if their cell phone data still worked.

169
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,003
Scott: Yeah, but imagine if all SMS stopped working.

170
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:04,430
Scott: It's like I guess iMessage would keep working.

171
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,364
Rym: There was an SMS outage many years ago that was like a day long.

172
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:09,850
Rym: So imagine if that happened now.

173
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:11,149
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

174
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,936
Rym: Kakao Talk went down and there were a bunch of follow-ups to that.

175
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:24,390
Rym: So one, they appear to have lost, according to reporting, as many as 2 million users who jumped ship to mostly line and telegram.

176
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:27,840
Rym: And seem to have not gone back to Kakao Talk.

177
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,610
Rym: Like people were rattled by the fact that this went down.

178
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,930
Scott: That's also a large part of the user base because the population of like South Korea isn't that large.

179
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,312
Rym: Exactly.

180
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:40,220
Rym: So the problem was most people only use this.

181
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,544
Rym: So it went down.

182
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:43,710
Rym: Like if Twitter went down today, there are a lot of people.

183
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,950
Scott: The population is 52 million.

184
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,430
Rym: So two out of 52.

185
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,055
Rym: So imagine if Twitter went down hard.

186
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:58,121
Rym: There are hundreds of people who I kind of know or do know who.

187
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:03,150
Rym: the only way I really have to contact them that is like present is Twitter DMs or adding them.

188
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:08,481
Rym: So I basically just lose contact with them or I have to scramble to see like, do I have their email address?

189
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,826
Rym: Do I even have another way to contact this person?

190
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:12,389
Rym: And for some people, I just don't.

191
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,990
Scott: So I back up my Twitter regularly, so I'd at least have a record of all the, you know, like, oh, yeah, I got that.

192
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,486
Rym: But like, do I have another way to contact some of those people?

193
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:24,650
Rym: Not necessarily.

194
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:30,097
Rym: So a lot of people only use Kakao Talk.

195
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:36,150
Rym: So even if those people start using Kakao Talk again when it's back, this is dangerous to Kakao Talk.

196
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,370
Rym: I'm just going to keep saying Kakao Talk until because you really like that name.

197
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:47,410
Rym: There's a reason that I'll share in the stinger at the end of the show that you will never have encountered and will not care about.

198
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,049
Rym: It's a deeply inside joke.

199
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,169
Scott: Is it a joke about the word Kakao?

200
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:51,394
Rym: Yes, it is.

201
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:54,250
Rym: But you will never encountered this, nor will you be interested in it.

202
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,030
Rym: Is it about chocolate or cocaine?

203
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:57,573
Rym: Neither.

204
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,009
Rym: It is about safe words and sex.

205
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:01,225
Scott: Oh, OK.

206
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,731
Rym: Yeah.

207
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:05,330
Scott: So I thought butterscotch is the word you want to go for.

208
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:06,232
Rym: Depends.

209
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:12,350
Rym: So anyway, Kakao Talk goes down and a lot of people only use Kakao Talk.

210
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:23,110
Rym: So now those people have had to put forth the effort to set up alternative means of communication with key people like their family and coordinated this.

211
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:29,490
Rym: So now those people, even if they go back to using Kakao Talk, have an alternative that they've already set up.

212
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:40,350
Rym: So like if Twitter goes down, I could send a discord or an email to like Daryl Surratt or Mike Tool, because I have put forth the effort to make sure I have a way to contact people who I care about in some way.

213
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,986
Scott: That is dangerous to those people.

214
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:43,410
Scott: Yeah.

215
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:50,930
Rym: But Kakao Talk is in danger because a lot of its popularity has relied upon the fact that it's the only game in town for most people.

216
00:12:52,831 --> 00:12:58,170
Rym: The easiest way to get people to switch platforms is to have them already using multiple platforms.

217
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:05,310
Rym: And then if one of those platforms crosses them for the last time, they've already moved, gotten all their friends to also use a second platform.

218
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,212
Rym: The move is easier.

219
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:13,090
Scott: Now, the real problem here is that Kakao Talk has this feature where you can make one log in.

220
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:13,492
Scott: Right.

221
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,297
Scott: Just one log in.

222
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:15,848
Scott: But you could have multiple identities.

223
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:16,070
Scott: Right.

224
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,935
Scott: So you don't need to like.

225
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,530
Scott: do like on Reddit where you make like throwaway accounts.

226
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,932
Scott: Yeah.

227
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:20,133
Scott: Right.

228
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:20,917
Scott: Or like Twitter.

229
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:22,444
Scott: I have several Twitter accounts.

230
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:23,610
Rym: They're just right.

231
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:27,089
Scott: Well, you can log into your several Twitter accounts, actually, with one log in.

232
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,128
Rym: Oh yeah, they're all in TweetDeck, too.

233
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,880
Scott: They're still separate accounts, but they're sort of linked.

234
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:33,550
Scott: On Kakao, you can make like identities.

235
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,431
Scott: Right.

236
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,430
Scott: Sort of like the way you make Netflix profiles for different people in the house.

237
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,216
Rym: Now, there's some context you all need to know.

238
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:43,063
Rym: that sounds like an obvious easy feature, but it is.

239
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:51,190
Rym: it is different and special, specifically in South Korea, in ways that are about to become very important when we get to the third part of this story.

240
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,501
Rym: Kakao Talk only even introduced this feature in 2020.

241
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,104
Rym: It's a new feature.

242
00:13:57,931 --> 00:14:08,770
Rym: So in Korea, if you want to do pretty much anything online, we learned about this at RIT, trying to play like a handful of Korean online games in like the early 2000s from a friend of ours.

243
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:13,510
Rym: You need to have basically the Korean equivalent of a social security number.

244
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:17,030
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure if you actually need that for Kakao Talk, but it's possible.

245
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,510
Rym: But you need it for a lot of online things in Korea.

246
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,914
Scott: There are things you do need it for online.

247
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:23,274
Scott: Yes.

248
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:28,002
Scott: And also they have you know, I think they use it to identify people who do things online.

249
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:33,050
Scott: because, you know, there are, you know, legal consequences for posting shitty things online.

250
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:46,210
Scott: If you go on to like a news story in Korea and post comments and like start slandering and libeling or saying nasty, mean things about celebrities, like they can actually sue you and win the current laws there.

251
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,836
Rym: That is that and they can identify you.

252
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:54,350
Rym: There are good and extremely bad and dangerous aspects of that.

253
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,296
Rym: It is a mixed bag, to be sure.

254
00:14:56,316 --> 00:15:00,790
Scott: Now, obviously, if they if you go on to some other service, like a 4chan equivalent, that's not going to happen.

255
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:09,070
Scott: But if you go on to like, you know, the like New York Times in the US as a comment section, if you go to the equivalent in Korea, they're going to know who you are.

256
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,010
Scott: If you comment there, you can't write bad things.

257
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:12,533
Rym: That's a mixed bag.

258
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:13,656
Rym: That's not the topic of the show.

259
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:18,310
Rym: But it is not all great that this is so tightly controlled in Korea.

260
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:25,909
Rym: So people would make alternate profiles in Kakao Talk to separate aspects of their lives.

261
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:33,050
Scott: My family identity would just say Scott and then I would have a friend one like a boo the ghost and then a different one.

262
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,790
Scott: Maybe I'd make one just for talking to hockey people, the NES hockey man.

263
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,529
Rym: And you could like set the visibility and all these to be different, like pretty good feature.

264
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:49,730
Scott: So on Discord on each server, you can have a different name and a different, you know, emoji profile photo image guy.

265
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:53,409
Scott: But it's all linked like the same Discord ID, though, if they want to DM you.

266
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:59,530
Rym: So supposedly, and I say supposedly because there is not a lot of good English language reporting on this.

267
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:11,190
Rym: As part of this outage, tons of people were able to see all of the identities of other people that were previously hidden from them.

268
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:13,028
Rym: So this could be innocuous.

269
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,447
Scott: So if Rym had an extra profile that he was using for, I don't know, secret.

270
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:22,481
Rym: Well, maybe benign for us.

271
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,790
Rym: Let's say I had one just for Overwatch.

272
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,690
Rym: Like I had one just my Overwatch friends.

273
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,469
Rym: Now all my Overwatch friends like, oh, that's Rym the GeekNights guy.

274
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:33,110
Rym: And meanwhile, all of you were like, whoa, Rym knows all these Overwatch people.

275
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:33,849
Rym: OK, whatever.

276
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:41,108
Rym: But say Joey Jojo Shabbat, who is cheating on his husband and has a separate account for Tinder meetings.

277
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:50,170
Rym: Let's say someone who is gay has an alternate account to sidestep the fact that their family is not cool with that.

278
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:57,530
Rym: Let's say somebody has an account to have normal conversations with people outside of the spotlight.

279
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:04,390
Scott: Maybe somebody who is a politician is actually pretending to be in that party.

280
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,550
Scott: And is this where they're talking and be someone who's a spy, a spy.

281
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,650
Scott: Hopefully a real spy wouldn't be using to hug for their secure communication.

282
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,232
Rym: Oh, my God.

283
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,250
Rym: Next week on Thursday, I'm going to talk about the spy news that broke today.

284
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:20,628
Rym: I got to read more before I say anything about it, but it's a big goddamn deal.

285
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:21,750
Scott: Anyway.

286
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,887
Rym: Did you see that?

287
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:23,718
Rym: Yeah.

288
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:24,219
Rym: Yeah.

289
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,758
Rym: The cool part about that and I'll just leave it, but it's just so cool is the flex of the U.S.

290
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:37,230
Rym: intelligence community by saying out loud in public that they got them via American paid double agents.

291
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:41,829
Scott: Hopefully those double agents are retired now.

292
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:42,583
Rym: Yeah.

293
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,157
Rym: Well, I guess that I get there's.

294
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:47,434
Rym: well, you're not in that discord channel where we're talking about this, but there's a lot of.

295
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:50,589
Rym: there's a lot of interesting ramifications of what just happened there.

296
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,469
Scott: So, yeah, this cow cow talk thing blew up.

297
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,046
Scott: It's not good.

298
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:54,420
Rym: Yep.

299
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,270
Rym: This outage, independent of all these other factors.

300
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:07,730
Rym: So cow talk is already in trouble from earlier this year because they make a lot of money with in-app purchases.

301
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:12,750
Rym: And Google finally said, yo, we want to cut or we're kicking you off of Android.

302
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,810
Rym: That happened in July and it escalated.

303
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:22,810
Rym: There's a bunch of lawsuits and they capitulated, which is our is hurting the revenue big time because now Google's going to take a cut of everything.

304
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:36,090
Rym: And even worse, there seem to be indications that in Korea now anti the equivalent of antitrust is happening, going after them because they're so big and so monopolistic.

305
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:38,869
Rym: And because this outage has exposed how dangerous that is.

306
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:42,830
Scott: No, that's, you know, people these that's how the whole world works.

307
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,950
Scott: People are reactionary and not proactive.

308
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,209
Rym: But in this case, it might be reasonable.

309
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:58,290
Scott: I mean, reasonable people have constantly, you know, throughout history, you know, raised warnings and they're always treated as, you know, like wackos.

310
00:18:58,457 --> 00:18:58,690
Scott: Right.

311
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,769
Scott: Like, what are you worried about?

312
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,650
Scott: Stop raising all.

313
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,950
Scott: You know, it's like and then they turn out to be right.

314
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,150
Rym: And it's like, oh, it's the use.

315
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:18,270
Rym: So there is a problem that I've experienced firsthand because I've used these apps like Grab in a lot of Asia, a lot of Africa, where there'll be a country where there's one app that basically literally does everything.

316
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:26,090
Rym: Like you use the same app to order groceries and to hire a cab and to arrange a flight and to chat with your mom and to look for sex.

317
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:28,189
Rym: Like everything's just in one fucking app.

318
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:35,410
Rym: So that app has incredible power and an effective monopoly because it's very sticky to have someone in that kind of ecosystem.

319
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:41,570
Rym: The United States and Europe have largely avoided this for very different reasons.

320
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,109
Rym: Europe has extreme regulations that sometimes even actually probably go too far.

321
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:47,513
Rym: And the U.S.

322
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:52,370
Rym: has entrenched but also incompetent companies like Google and Facebook.

323
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:53,373
Rym: So they've never.

324
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:59,370
Rym: they've always wanted to make the app that does everything, but they have failed to do so in their own capitalist shithole.

325
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,050
Scott: So each one of those companies has succeeded to make one app that does something.

326
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,810
Scott: So you have to have one app from each company.

327
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,290
Scott: You need Amazon for shopping and Apple for this and Google for that.

328
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:21,550
Rym: And it is not great, but it is effectively saved Americans from the worst fate of it is all just one company, which is extremely dangerous for all the reasons.

329
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:28,029
Rym: If you if you listen to gig nights, you are the kind of person who can appreciate how absolutely dangerous that is.

330
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:31,438
Scott: One last tiny news, right?

331
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:35,130
Scott: So I wrote a whole thing about it in the forum and the camera thread.

332
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,370
Scott: You can go read there to get a longer story about this.

333
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,202
Scott: But Leica, which is a luxury camera brand, right?

334
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:44,330
Scott: Basically the Rolex of cameras.

335
00:20:45,031 --> 00:20:48,927
Scott: There is a camera that they made, a film camera that is very popular, the Leica M6.

336
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:54,491
Scott: They made it from like 1984 to 2002.

337
00:20:54,491 --> 00:21:00,750
Scott: And used ones are expensive and in demand because pretty much all film photography stuff is expensive and in demand.

338
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:09,349
Scott: But this camera in particular, even more expensive and in demand and not easy to get despite being in production for so long, et cetera.

339
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:17,646
Scott: And what like it, there was a rumor that they were going to make something like it again to sort of satisfy the market.

340
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:23,490
Scott: That was clearly appearing and the rumors turned out to have been true.

341
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,875
Scott: They did rerelease this camera, right?

342
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:33,289
Scott: Effectively almost identical to the camera that they stopped making in 20 years ago.

343
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:36,378
Scott: Except the price is $5,500.

344
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,888
Scott: but it's expensive as fuck, right?

345
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:40,650
Scott: You're not going to buy one.

346
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:49,470
Rym: So $5,500 just for context, that would be the price of two Cinema 4K camcorders.

347
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,302
Scott: Yeah, pretty much, right?

348
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:51,910
Scott: It's ridiculous.

349
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,806
Scott: And all it is is a 35mm analog still photo camera rangefinder, right?

350
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:58,930
Scott: That's it.

351
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,410
Scott: However, the thing I wanted, you know, you can read all the details about this that I wrote on the forum.

352
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:06,244
Rym: I will link to Scott's forum post.

353
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:06,890
Rym: It's really good.

354
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:12,090
Scott: There's thousands of YouTube videos people have made on the internet already talking about what's going on here.

355
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:22,730
Scott: But the thing that I want to focus on for the show, imagine if Nintendo was like, you know, we keep seeing people buying used NESs on eBay.

356
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:25,838
Scott: Let's just bring the NES back into production.

357
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,285
Scott: Just fucking NESs identical to 1990s NESs.

358
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,309
Scott: Just like, they're the same.

359
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,608
Rym: But maybe they've got HDMI out on the back, like...

360
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,420
Scott: Right, it's like, no, not even HDMI out on the back.

361
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,970
Scott: It's the same fucking thing, right?

362
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,710
Scott: And just put it back on the shelves on the stores, right?

363
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,163
Scott: It's like, what if, I don't know, what's another one?

364
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:49,050
Scott: that's some old nerdy thing?

365
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,127
Rym: Oh god, it wasn't Bianchi but...

366
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:51,731
Scott: Apple!

367
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:55,870
Scott: Apple was just like, you know what, we're just gonna start making original iPods again.

368
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,895
Scott: iPod classics.

369
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:59,870
Scott: They're not any different from the iPod classics back in the day.

370
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:00,980
Rym: I don't have a link to it, Andy.

371
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,666
Rym: I saw...

372
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,010
Scott: Same old spinning wheel, same old magnetic hard drive.

373
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:12,429
Rym: Some small company that made like touring bicycles in the 70s and just like making more bikes that are identical to their old 70s bikes.

374
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:19,468
Rym: They're not better than modern bikes and they're more expensive than modern bikes, but they are basically like replicas of the bikes they made in the 70s.

375
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:22,309
Scott: Yep, so that's what's happening here.

376
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:30,241
Scott: I guess the only difference is that this product is indeed a timeless product that it's like... I would get one if it wasn't $500-300.

377
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:37,370
Rym: I feel like a few thousand dollars would make like a couple thousand-ish plus.

378
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,830
Scott: Considering the digital camera that I could get for that amount of money.

379
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:41,873
Rym: True, yeah.

380
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:45,830
Rym: For five thousand-ish dollars, what fucking DSLR are we gonna buy?

381
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,219
Scott: Like the sensors as big as your fist.

382
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,610
Scott: Right, especially since the cost of film is going up, right?

383
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,122
Rym: I am actually looking at buying a new DSLR because you know what?

384
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,990
Rym: My DSLR is my old GX-1.

385
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,200
Scott: You want my GH5?

386
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,876
Rym: Let me do a little research.

387
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:07,846
Rym: I kind of want a newer one for a bunch of reasons.

388
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:08,689
Rym: I want a big old sensor.

389
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,349
Scott: It's very new.

390
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:10,954
Rym: We'll see.

391
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:11,457
Rym: Maybe.

392
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:12,865
Rym: I'm not opposed.

393
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:13,570
Rym: I gotta think on it.

394
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,630
Rym: Because the main thing is the GX-1 has a pretty small sensor and it's really old.

395
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:25,110
Rym: But two, it does not have HDMI output, so I can't even use it as just like a regular camera.

396
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,770
Scott: This one has a full-size HDMI output.

397
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,903
Rym: It also can record video, but it's locked.

398
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:33,388
Rym: It can only record 20-ish minutes.

399
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:34,130
Rym: because of that old European...

400
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,990
Scott: This camera can record infinite length video until you run out of battery and/or memory.

401
00:24:38,712 --> 00:24:39,535
Rym: I will decide.

402
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:44,170
Rym: I might take you up on that after I do a little research and pricing and I might make you an offer.

403
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,696
Rym: But stay tuned because I need a new DSLR.

404
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:50,990
Rym: I am taking photos again and the GX-1 is not good enough.

405
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,392
Rym: It is too old.

406
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:59,290
Rym: However, if anyone wants a DSLR, I will give my GX-1 away pretty cheap, maybe free.

407
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,950
Rym: Because it's a fine camera unless you know why it's not.

408
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,370
Rym: And if you don't know why it's not, it's still better than your iPhone camera.

409
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:11,890
Scott: Well, I think the problem is that camera specifically is no longer in the category of being better than a phone camera.

410
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:20,920
Rym: Yeah, so it is only better than a phone camera if you are going to put lenses on it and I'm keeping my lenses, so... I ain't giving up those lenses.

411
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:21,870
Rym: I spent a lot of money on those.

412
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,990
Scott: Those lenses will work on the camera that I can give you.

413
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:24,688
Rym: Yeah, they will.

414
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:29,450
Scott: If you go buy a camera with a different sensor, those lenses aren't going to do anything.

415
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:31,050
Scott: They'll be useless.

416
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,380
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

417
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:49,000
Rym: So, uh, in 1995, there was some software called Microsoft 3D Movie Maker, which I was vaguely aware of, but I never used it.

418
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,748
Scott: I never heard of it.

419
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:50,780
Scott: Never heard of it before today.

420
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,600
Rym: Yep, it's pretty good, actually, but it looks like it was from 1995.

421
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,777
Rym: Like, if you look at a random screenshot of this thing and you're as old as us, you will say, "That is from the

422
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:02,978
Rym: mid-90s.".

423
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:15,920
Rym: But it's pretty good software that you can use to basically do low-budget 3D animation kind of better than you would think.

424
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,060
Rym: Like, this is way better than you are imagining, considering it's 1995.

425
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:28,960
Rym: And my thing of the day is that Microsoft, at the urging of some cool people, has actually done something amazing.

426
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:35,400
Rym: They went through all the hassle of sorting out all the licensing and open-source nonsense and everything.

427
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:40,696
Rym: They have open-sourced it, released the code, you can use it, you can run it, you can make memes with it.

428
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:41,739
Rym: It is out there.

429
00:26:44,162 --> 00:26:47,798
Rym: And it looks like people are already contributing to this project to enhance it.

430
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:55,635
Rym: So if you want to make, like, your Steamed Hams meme in some 1995 software, there is a niche for you.

431
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:00,647
Rym: So this is the cool part of open-source software.

432
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:05,680
Rym: I really wish more companies were willing to put forth the effort to do this kind of thing.

433
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:12,014
Scott: All right, so I think I had a recent thing of the day where somebody took a word processor and hooked it up as, like, a terminal.

434
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:14,480
Scott: so they would, like, type on the word processor or go to the terminal.

435
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:16,039
Rym: Oh, yeah, that was a cool thing of the day.

436
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:17,900
Scott: It would print on the paper, right?

437
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:26,360
Scott: Well, here's somebody, you know, back in the day, right, when word processors were a thing, they were a lot cheaper than computers because they were a lot simpler, right?

438
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:30,550
Scott: An actual computer needed all kinds of extra stuff in there.

439
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:33,640
Scott: Mostly storage was the big expense in those days, right?

440
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,036
Rym: I mean, at that time, the fanciest thing we had was an electric typewriter, which was way easier to use than the old manual one.

441
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:40,200
Rym: We couldn't even afford a word processor.

442
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,007
Scott: But anyway, so here's somebody.

443
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:47,619
Scott: They have a mini... The title of the article is "Mini 5 Word

444
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:48,000
Scott: Crusher.".

445
00:27:48,140 --> 00:28:02,800
Scott: Apparently, this old Japanese PWP50HA NEC Mini 5HA, right, is a portable CRT-based word processor with a built-in printer and floppy drive, 3.5-inch floppy drive.

446
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:11,460
Scott: And I guess somewhat secretly and undocumentedly, this actually was running CP/M.

447
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:23,860
Scott: If you don't know what CP/M is, it's this operating system, Control Program Monitor, that was basically the operating system for Intel 8080 processors before DOS came out.

448
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:32,220
Scott: It was like what people used on PCs, you know, ADX, whatever, chips, before there was DOS, right?

449
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:41,920
Scott: They used CP/M, which is made by, you know, Digital Research Group, which incorporated whatever, which is not the same company as Digital Equipment Corp that made, like, deck alphas.

450
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:43,176
Scott: That was a completely different thing.

451
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:56,380
Scott: And so because this word processor runs CP/M, you can use it like a computer even though it's a word processor and try to run software on it and such and such.

452
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,703
Scott: And that's exactly what this person does.

453
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:02,270
Scott: I think that's pretty cool, right?

454
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:07,420
Scott: This would be like, you know, if you took what compute, like some Internet of Things computer, right?

455
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:16,500
Scott: Like, you know, some fucking toaster that has Wi-Fi and you actually, I guess people do run Doom on those things, but like, you know.

456
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,618
Scott: I guess it's like that, but the device is really, really old and it's even more impressive in some ways that they were able to...

457
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,772
Rym: You know, some days people are like, "I got DOS running on an abacus.

458
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:27,816
Rym: It takes a while, but it

459
00:29:27,856 --> 00:29:28,157
Rym: works.".

460
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,070
Scott: Does it have a transistor?

461
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:31,340
Scott: Then I can make it run Doom.

462
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:36,160
Rym: I made Doom out of nothing but NAND gates.

463
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:37,483
Scott: Yep.

464
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:38,429
Scott: One of them.

465
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:39,053
Scott: A gate.

466
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,860
Scott: A gate and a clock.

467
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,146
Rym: The GeekNights Book Club book was bit to you.

468
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:48,887
Rym: We have finished it.

469
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:49,629
Rym: The episode is up.

470
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,793
Rym: It's the whole trilogy.

471
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:51,394
Rym: It's great.

472
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:52,377
Rym: You should read it.

473
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:53,580
Rym: It'll take you a couple hours.

474
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,373
Rym: You want to take on Space University and Space Jellyfish who are kind of like Klingons.

475
00:29:59,794 --> 00:30:00,917
Rym: There's good stuff in there.

476
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:01,759
Rym: We had a good time.

477
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:10,360
Scott: The new book club book is A Leaf the Unseen by G. Willow Wilson.

478
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:14,098
Scott: I haven't read any pages yet, so...

479
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,498
Rym: I have not read any pages yet either, but I did buy it.

480
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:18,983
Rym: So Scott can make the post.

481
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:26,300
Rym: I still got to link the episode to the old post, which I will do tonight at some point because I forgot to do that last week and I just remembered as I'm looking at our website.

482
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:27,741
Rym: So yeah.

483
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:28,583
Rym: GeekNights Book Club.

484
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:31,828
Rym: We are fully past the Genji era.

485
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,980
Rym: There will be regular book club episodes from this point forward and it's good timing because winter is coming.

486
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,541
Rym: We will be.

487
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:42,843
Rym: Maybe me and Scott.

488
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:43,684
Rym: Maybe just me.

489
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:46,848
Rym: Probably both of us because it's a road trip and a day trip.

490
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:50,413
Rym: On Sunday at PAX Unplugged, there is a GeekNights panel.

491
00:30:50,794 --> 00:30:55,560
Rym: that is an updated version of an old panel that they specifically asked us to do as opposed to the new one.

492
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:56,416
Scott: December 4th.

493
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,460
Rym: Yep.

494
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:02,508
Rym: So this panel is titled "Why is this game taking four

495
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:03,009
Rym: hours?".

496
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:10,300
Rym: It's an updated version of Take Your Fucking Turn, but there are some significant updates that I think are worth adding to that panel.

497
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:19,857
Rym: Also, full disclosure, that deck, the slides for that panel took more effort than most GeekNights panels we have ever done, so I got to fucking milk.

498
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:21,620
Rym: I got to do that panel more times.

499
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:33,800
Rym: But otherwise, we will probably, since the panel is on Sunday, we will only be at PAX Unplugged on Sunday, so do not come to PAX expecting us to play games with you on Friday and Saturday.

500
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,819
Rym: I suspect we will drive in, do the panel, walk around the counter in masks, hang out, drive home at the end of the day.

501
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:43,138
Rym: I will be at Genji Con very likely.

502
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,719
Scott: It seems more likely to be happening.

503
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,422
Rym: Yep.

504
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:47,120
Rym: I mean, the driving makes it easier.

505
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,240
Scott: Looking at my calendar, I think it can happen, maybe.

506
00:31:49,522 --> 00:31:50,391
Rym: Yeah, I'll just drive you there.

507
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,238
Rym: That's a short drive.

508
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,680
Scott: Unless there's a huge resurgence of COVID, which could happen.

509
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,943
Rym: It very much could.

510
00:31:57,147 --> 00:32:01,238
Rym: At least PAX Unplugged is still a mask and vaccination required event.

511
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:01,579
Rym: However...

512
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:02,178
Scott: That's true.

513
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:08,291
Rym: I urge all of you, I cannot stress this enough, get the new COVID booster.

514
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:12,700
Rym: Too many people, even smart people I know, weren't paying attention and don't realize it's out.

515
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:17,575
Rym: It is super effective against all known Omicron variants.

516
00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:18,879
Rym: That is not to say...

517
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,419
Scott: Non-Omicron ones, though?

518
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:31,000
Rym: XBB is an Omicron variant, apparently, and there are multiple credible reports, real reporting, that the new booster is extremely effective against XBB.

519
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,296
Scott: Okay.

520
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:43,340
Rym: My anecdote is that a huge number of people who were at an indoor, unmasked work event that I was at all got COVID right after that event.

521
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,760
Rym: All of them got it like that.

522
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,487
Scott: You got coworkers that got it.

523
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:46,860
Scott: I have families that got it.

524
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,860
Rym: And I was there unmasked with all of those individuals, and all of them got it, and I did not.

525
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:59,600
Rym: And the only difference between the people who got it and the people who didn't is 100% of the people who did not get it had the booster.

526
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:02,920
Rym: And 100% of the people who got it did not have the booster.

527
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,408
Rym: That is anecdotal.

528
00:33:04,912 --> 00:33:05,880
Rym: That is not a study.

529
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,280
Scott: How many people were at this event?

530
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,043
Rym: Like 40.

531
00:33:10,043 --> 00:33:11,840
Rym: So, it is anecdotal.

532
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:17,380
Rym: I am not saying if you get the booster, you can throw all caution to the wind.

533
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,240
Rym: Do not get me wrong.

534
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:28,420
Rym: I am simply saying that that booster is extremely effective, and you should get it to protect yourself regardless of the level of precautions you continue to take.

535
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,460
Rym: It's weird to me that a lot of people do not realize that booster is available.

536
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:40,060
Rym: It also will not be free after December 31st because Republicans blocked the bill that would continue the funding.

537
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:43,880
Scott: Well, you got insurance since it could be effectively free.

538
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,340
Rym: If you have insurance, it'll be free.

539
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,200
Rym: If you don't have insurance starting December 31st, COVID shots are not free anymore.

540
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,938
Rym: Thank the Republican Party for that.

541
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:52,936
Scott: All right.

542
00:33:53,140 --> 00:34:02,460
Scott: So, this not so long main bit, but something that's been on my mind lately because I'm not going to tell any of these actual anecdotes specifically.

543
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:07,620
Rym: I will tell generalized anecdotes as well, but I will not name names, and I'll leave out specifics.

544
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:11,899
Rym: Some of you who are listening probably know I'm talking about you, FYI.

545
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:23,360
Scott: I have recently come into contact with many anecdotes from real people I know, as well as strangers, of people who have gotten into trouble and drama in their lives.

546
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:42,000
Scott: You know, strife and general badness sometimes deserved, sometimes undeserved because they, and I don't want to blame the victim here, but all of these dramas and all of these anecdotes could have been avoided.

547
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:53,239
Scott: If the people whose cell phones, smartphones were involved in the drama had been handled the way I personally handle my smartphone.

548
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:54,235
Scott: Yep.

549
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:57,577
Scott: So, I want to just get the word out there, right?

550
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:07,780
Scott: People might think that these things I'm saying are ridiculous or too much work or a pain in the ass, but it's like, yeah, you say that until one of these dramas happens to you.

551
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:15,017
Scott: And then you'll say, "Damn, I wish I would have listened to Scott and handled my phone securely and carefully the way that Scott

552
00:35:15,037 --> 00:35:15,278
Scott: does.".

553
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:19,489
Scott: So, an example anecdote, right?

554
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:22,560
Scott: We'll do one, a deserved one and an undeserved one.

555
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,529
Rym: Before you do the anecdote, the one thing I'll say is there are two categories of these.

556
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:28,820
Rym: I think it's worth just noting that because I think our anecdotes will fall into one of the two categories.

557
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:37,640
Rym: Category one involves access to the phone in any capacity and category two involves the phone being itself insecure or compromised in some fashion.

558
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:38,480
Scott: Yep.

559
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:38,801
Scott: Okay.

560
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:43,629
Scott: So, anecdote one, somebody was at a restaurant and their phone was on the table, right?

561
00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:50,680
Scott: And they were with somebody and they got messages on the phone and the messages popped up on the lock screen.

562
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,489
Scott: Notifications.

563
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,018
Rym: Like they do not do for me.

564
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:59,571
Scott: And the person sitting across from them saw the messages out of the corner of their eye.

565
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:04,300
Scott: They weren't necessarily able to read the entire message, but they saw who the message was from.

566
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:11,215
Scott: And now they knew the person sitting across from them was in contact with person X and it caused a drama, right?

567
00:36:11,656 --> 00:36:13,060
Scott: So, that's anecdote number one.

568
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:15,725
Scott: Anecdote number two, right?

569
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:22,940
Scott: A person, you know, was, you know, left their phone in the living room and like went to the bathroom or something, right?

570
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:33,840
Scott: And another person was snooping and was being bad and took the phone, unlocked it and snooped and saw shit that caused a drama.

571
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,743
Scott: Because the phone wasn't locked properly.

572
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:36,983
Scott: All right.

573
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:39,086
Scott: Oh, I can add, I can add one more, right?

574
00:36:39,126 --> 00:36:39,827
Scott: Here's one more.

575
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:41,910
Scott: Somebody, right?

576
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:46,577
Scott: Had a, was, was, uh, you know, there was, there was like a kid or somebody, right?

577
00:36:46,877 --> 00:36:48,740
Scott: Who wanted to watch Netflix, right?

578
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:54,020
Scott: So, they unlocked their phone and gave it to the kid to watch Netflix, right?

579
00:36:55,661 --> 00:37:03,131
Scott: But there was an adult nearby and they saw stuff on the phone, maybe popped up as notifications, right?

580
00:37:03,732 --> 00:37:09,620
Scott: And that was stuff that person didn't, you know, the person, the owner of the phone didn't want them to see.

581
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,423
Rym: I have a drama ensued.

582
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:25,160
Rym: Anecdote number four that is almost identical to your previous anecdote, but instead of stranger saw something, it's kids saw hardcore pornography in another app that was open in the background.

583
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,281
Scott: Whoa.

584
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:32,976
Rym: That was related to me a couple months ago by someone who is not in our circles, but is in other circles.

585
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,118
Rym: I am is no one we know.

586
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:34,800
Rym: No one, you know.

587
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:34,960
Rym: Okay.

588
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,629
Scott: So how, so what does Scott do and what does, I'm 99% sure Rym also do.

589
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:40,871
Rym: I will be shocked.

590
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:45,320
Rym: if there is anything that we disagree on in this episode, I will be very shocked.

591
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:45,680
Scott: Okay.

592
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:50,566
Scott: So how do you avoid any of these potential things happening to you in your life?

593
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:55,091
Scott: Rule number one, absolutely nobody other than you, right?

594
00:37:55,251 --> 00:38:03,780
Scott: You as in you, not your significant other, not your sibling, not your child, not your parent, not the government, not a police officer.

595
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:09,259
Rym: If it is Star Trek and you are transporter cloned and there are two of you, you should have separate cell phones.

596
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:10,381
Scott: That's right.

597
00:38:10,762 --> 00:38:18,150
Scott: Nobody other than you should ever touch your fucking phone when it is unlocked ever under.

598
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,593
Scott: no, not in an emergency, not in.

599
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:22,215
Scott: you're in a middle of a house on fire.

600
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:26,300
Scott: There was no situation, none, not any ridiculous hypothetical.

601
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,403
Rym: I would back up a little bit in that.

602
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:34,193
Rym: access it because most phones have a, you can still call nine one one, even if it's not yours capability.

603
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:34,974
Scott: Exactly.

604
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:38,420
Scott: I, that's why I said when it's unlocked, when it's unlocked is the key.

605
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:38,861
Rym: That's right.

606
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:45,400
Rym: Because if you, if you're choking to death in your apartment and it's on fire and I don't have my phone on me, I'm pulling your phone out of your pocket.

607
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,434
Scott: No, as long as your phone is locked, as long as your phone is locked, it's okay to let somebody else touch it.

608
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:54,200
Scott: As long as you know, you're, you know, they're not gonna just run away with it.

609
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,166
Scott: It's like, uh, because as locked properly, we'll get to that.

610
00:38:58,226 --> 00:38:58,447
Scott: Right.

611
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:04,617
Scott: But every, both Android and iPhone have a feature where you can activate the camera while the phone is locked.

612
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:06,560
Scott: So you can hand it to a stranger to take your photo.

613
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:07,622
Scott: No problem.

614
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:09,366
Scott: Just don't hand him an unlocked one.

615
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:10,829
Scott: Make sure it's locked.

616
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:16,480
Scott: Open the camera app from the lock screen and give it to them that way so they can't access any of your shit.

617
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:21,386
Scott: If someone needs to access emergency info, you can press on an iPhone.

618
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:31,240
Scott: You can press the button on the right side, I think five times fast, and that will bring them to a screen where they can call, make emergency calls, access your medical ID, uh, turn the phone off.

619
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:38,910
Rym: You know, I just realized if I open the camera on an iPhone from the lock screen, like it, it stays locked, but my photo roll is available in there.

620
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:40,212
Scott: Exactly.

621
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:42,755
Rym: So even that is a risky business.

622
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,580
Scott: Well, I think, no, you shouldn't be able to, my phone is unlocked.

623
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,248
Rym: I just opened the camera app from the button on the lock screen without unlocking the phone.

624
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:52,289
Scott: Yep.

625
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,792
Rym: And my photo roll is still there.

626
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:55,575
Scott: My photo roll is not there.

627
00:39:55,635 --> 00:39:56,637
Scott: It's just a gray square.

628
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:57,278
Rym: Weird.

629
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:58,380
Rym: I wonder if there's a setting I have.

630
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,562
Scott: You might have a setting.

631
00:39:59,642 --> 00:40:00,984
Scott: Alright, so if that's a setting.

632
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:02,726
Rym: That's a setting I'm going to figure out and fix.

633
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:03,748
Rym: right the fuck now.

634
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:09,536
Scott: Yeah, mine is, the bottom left corner when I open the camera app from the lock screen is just a gray square.

635
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:12,020
Scott: No one can look through my photos if I hand them to my phone.

636
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:19,177
Rym: Granted, the reason this is not a problem for me is that I will not even hand my phone to someone to take a photo with it under any circumstances.

637
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:20,300
Scott: That's also perfectly fine.

638
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,732
Rym: Because I do not want someone to steal my phone, nor do I want to risk it because my phone is just a computer as far as I'm concerned.

639
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:29,194
Rym: Right, exactly.

640
00:40:29,255 --> 00:40:30,897
Scott: So that's rule number one.

641
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,500
Scott: Rule number two, alright, so you talk about that.

642
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,424
Scott: So don't give anyone your phone while it's unlocked.

643
00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:38,568
Scott: Don't ever, not under any circumstance, none.

644
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:41,793
Scott: There is no reason ever get your own damn phone, right?

645
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:46,440
Scott: Not reason number, number two, how do you lock your phone properly?

646
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:54,213
Scott: Well, A, you want to make sure that the phone locks itself after a brief period of unused, right?

647
00:40:54,554 --> 00:40:58,180
Scott: You want to make sure you push the button to lock it every time you stop using it.

648
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:03,320
Rym: Just like any Windows computer, if you ever walk away from your screen, control up, delete, or control L or whatever, lock it.

649
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,891
Scott: It's okay to use the face IDs or the touch IDs, right?

650
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,260
Scott: Nobody's actually going to copy your fingerprint or whatever.

651
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:24,840
Rym: So what I do there is I use face ID and I have sort of like baseline level security, but anytime I even have a hint that I will be in any type of situation where anything squirrely could happen, I'll often disable that just for a while.

652
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,983
Rym: But that's situational.

653
00:41:27,003 --> 00:41:35,700
Scott: There are also settings where, you know, face ID will let you unlock and do these things, but to do other things, it's going to ask the password again.

654
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,100
Rym: Yup.

655
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:41,268
Rym: Occasionally, if my phone is definitely on me, I will let it stay unlocked because it's in proximity of my watch.

656
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:47,777
Rym: But that is, again, that is a situation where my phone will be in my direct knowing custody at all moments.

657
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:50,020
Rym: I would not even let it sit on a table.

658
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:52,462
Scott: Yup, exactly.

659
00:41:53,223 --> 00:41:55,828
Scott: All right, so how do you make sure the phone is locked properly?

660
00:41:55,868 --> 00:41:58,192
Scott: Well, make sure it's locked, like we just said, right?

661
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:02,580
Scott: If it's unlocked, well, and you didn't realize it was unlocked, well, now you're in trouble, right?

662
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,124
Scott: So, but the locking mechanism, right?

663
00:42:05,144 --> 00:42:10,271
Scott: A lot of people just use like that Android thing with the grid or a four digit pin, right?

664
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:12,675
Scott: And those are kind of secure, kind of.

665
00:42:12,715 --> 00:42:13,516
Scott: They're good, right?

666
00:42:13,536 --> 00:42:16,380
Scott: A lot of people aren't locking the phone, which is really bad, right?

667
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,462
Scott: But that's okay.

668
00:42:18,723 --> 00:42:25,350
Scott: But the four digit one, people who are close to you are going to not through malice, right?

669
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:33,880
Scott: But just see over your shoulder often because they're with you a lot and they're eventually going to know your four digit code unless you change it often.

670
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,425
Rym: Hey, you live in a building with an elevator.

671
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:40,120
Rym: Whoever is the security for your building is probably seeing you type that code in at least once.

672
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,162
Rym: All right.

673
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:44,749
Scott: I use a whole goddamn ass passphrase, right?

674
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,673
Scott: Is it a pain in the ass when I have to type it in?

675
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:47,395
Scott: Yes.

676
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:48,918
Scott: But do I do it anyway?

677
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:49,920
Scott: Also, yes.

678
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,964
Rym: So I made one deviation from that just during COVID.

679
00:42:55,064 --> 00:43:14,000
Rym: before there was a feature that would let you like face ID work with a mask, where if I know my phone will not leave my touch at any point, like while we were in lockdown, I switched to using the four digit only during that time because I was often unlocking my phone while it was in my hand with a mask on repeatedly.

680
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:22,108
Rym: But that was a temporary weird situation where I was rarely going anywhere and my phone was literally always in my pocket.

681
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:27,734
Scott: But even then, it was edge cases are not really the right where people are getting not the edge cases.

682
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:30,457
Scott: If you get only getting edge cases wrong, you're fine, right?

683
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:33,660
Scott: People are not getting the base correct, right?

684
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,366
Rym: Yeah, because like the edge case would be the four digit code is easier to hack your phone with if someone steals it.

685
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:41,128
Rym: That's not a concern for most people.

686
00:43:41,148 --> 00:43:45,913
Scott: The concern is my neighbor knows her plus characters like you're not.

687
00:43:45,974 --> 00:43:47,755
Scott: nobody is going to be able to guess that.

688
00:43:47,776 --> 00:43:51,840
Rym: Oh, my actual passphrase is such a fucking pain in the ass to type on my phone.

689
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,441
Scott: Yeah, the keyboard, it's fine.

690
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:54,182
Scott: All right.

691
00:43:54,202 --> 00:44:06,610
Scott: So then on top of that, iPhones, I don't know about Android, but iPhone has a setting where if somebody tries to type the passphrase 10 times and gets it wrong 10 times, the phone will erase itself.

692
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,591
Scott: And you're like, oh, my God, that's so dangerous.

693
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:09,732
Scott: You know, you lose all your stuff.

694
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:10,893
Scott: It's like, no, I want my backups.

695
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:11,433
Scott: What I care.

696
00:44:11,793 --> 00:44:11,974
Scott: Right.

697
00:44:12,374 --> 00:44:13,755
Scott: I cloud is perfect backups.

698
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:16,717
Scott: I presume Google has some perfect backup mechanism.

699
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,138
Scott: that's equivalent for Android phones.

700
00:44:18,398 --> 00:44:20,639
Scott: If they don't, why did you get an Android phone?

701
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:21,440
Scott: That's like a necessity.

702
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,341
Scott: But I assume they do.

703
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:30,626
Rym: I am of the mind if if anything tries to enter any device I own too many times.

704
00:44:31,187 --> 00:44:34,509
Rym: Ideally, I want that device to fully self-destruct if possible.

705
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:35,489
Scott: Yeah.

706
00:44:35,649 --> 00:44:40,693
Scott: But yeah, the phone will just erase itself if someone tries and gets it wrong 10 times, which I encourage.

707
00:44:40,773 --> 00:44:41,914
Scott: enabling that setting.

708
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:42,294
Scott: Right.

709
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:48,858
Scott: And it's like the worst thing that can happen to you is you lose 30 minutes of your time loading a backup.

710
00:44:48,898 --> 00:44:49,098
Scott: Right.

711
00:44:49,138 --> 00:44:50,279
Scott: Because you back up often.

712
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:50,720
Scott: Right.

713
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,400
Scott: Right.

714
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,241
Scott: Yeah.

715
00:44:53,122 --> 00:44:53,422
Scott: OK.

716
00:44:53,442 --> 00:45:02,974
Rym: There should never be anything on your phone that it would be trouble if you lost it with the sole possible exception of your 2FA nonsense, which you're going to have to have a different backup for.

717
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:04,075
Scott: Yeah.

718
00:45:04,275 --> 00:45:05,337
Scott: That's why I use the YubiKey.

719
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:05,697
Scott: Yeah.

720
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:06,578
Scott: Separate thing for that.

721
00:45:06,678 --> 00:45:07,780
Scott: Yeah.

722
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:07,960
Scott: OK.

723
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,024
Scott: And now that the final piece of the puzzle, right.

724
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:14,052
Scott: Anecdote number one, someone was looking at the notifications, at least on iPhone.

725
00:45:14,072 --> 00:45:14,974
Scott: I don't know about Android.

726
00:45:15,014 --> 00:45:16,056
Rym: Android has a similar feature.

727
00:45:16,136 --> 00:45:17,459
Rym: Most people say, but it's there.

728
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,200
Scott: Yeah.

729
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,541
Scott: Yeah.

730
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:21,346
Scott: When you configure notifications for an app.

731
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:21,846
Scott: Right.

732
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:22,808
Scott: There is a setting.

733
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:29,420
Scott: Let me get it's per app, but you should be able to set the default for all apps to be the same thing.

734
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:29,840
Rym: Yeah.

735
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:41,958
Rym: Basically, you can control which kinds of notifications will show up with content on the lockstream versus which ones will just show up with a notification from this app happened with no content versus.

736
00:45:41,978 --> 00:45:42,499
Rym: Right.

737
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,200
Rym: Does not show up.

738
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,023
Scott: So here's, for example, my bank app.

739
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:45,303
Scott: Right.

740
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:51,012
Scott: You go to you go to an iPhone, you go to settings notifications, then you choose the app you want to set.

741
00:45:51,092 --> 00:45:51,252
Scott: Right.

742
00:45:51,272 --> 00:45:52,414
Scott: So choose my bank's app.

743
00:45:52,995 --> 00:45:56,220
Scott: And then it says at the bottom lock screen appearance.

744
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,444
Scott: And it says show previews.

745
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:00,685
Scott: And there's three options.

746
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:02,127
Scott: Always never.

747
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:03,429
Scott: And when unlocked.

748
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:06,693
Scott: So you want to set that to either when unlocked or never.

749
00:46:06,873 --> 00:46:07,053
Scott: Right.

750
00:46:07,093 --> 00:46:20,990
Scott: Because showing previews would mean that the notification on the lock screen would actually contain real information like your deposit went through or the actual contents of a text message.

751
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:21,231
Scott: Right.

752
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:29,000
Scott: If you turn that off instead, let's say Rym text me and I have it set to not show previews and the phone is locked.

753
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,126
Scott: It'll simply say on the lock screen incoming text message.

754
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:42,360
Scott: It might not say it won't say who it is or what the messages, but I'll just know I got a text message and have to unlock the phone to see what is in that message.

755
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,443
Scott: Now, is that the way you want it to be?

756
00:46:44,504 --> 00:46:47,268
Rym: Because, one, my phone unlocks instantly if I so much as look at it.

757
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:49,813
Rym: Two, I have a watch that also shows me the notification.

758
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:53,098
Rym: Watches are a different ballgame because your watch locks itself if you take it off.

759
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,140
Scott: Yep.

760
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,240
Scott: Yeah.

761
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:55,621
Scott: Don't worry.

762
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:57,083
Scott: The watches are not too much of it.

763
00:46:57,123 --> 00:47:09,140
Rym: Now, this one is actually not just a drama vector, but an attack vector because a very easy attack if your notification show up on the lock screen is try to log into your friend's account, trigger a password reset.

764
00:47:09,441 --> 00:47:11,144
Rym: The SMS code goes to their phone.

765
00:47:11,344 --> 00:47:12,346
Rym: that's sitting on the table.

766
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:13,889
Rym: You see it on their lock screen.

767
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:15,051
Rym: You've got their account now.

768
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:16,214
Scott: Yep.

769
00:47:16,474 --> 00:47:18,798
Rym: That is an attack you could do on your friends right now.

770
00:47:18,899 --> 00:47:19,580
Rym: It's so easy.

771
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:30,368
Scott: If your friend leaves their phone out on a table and you're sitting near it and you have a computer, you could probably log in to like their Discord or whatever using SMS without having to do.

772
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,450
Scott: And it's like, how many times do you hear, "Oh, my Instagram was

773
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:33,750
Scott: hacked.".

774
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,492
Scott: It's probably something like that.

775
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:37,013
Scott: And I had two FA.

776
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:38,974
Scott: Someone was looking at your phone while they did it.

777
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:40,295
Scott: It's probably something close to you.

778
00:47:40,555 --> 00:47:41,976
Scott: That's the most likely scenario.

779
00:47:42,377 --> 00:47:46,640
Scott: Turn off notification previews and lock your goddamn phone.

780
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,060
Rym: Yep.

781
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,183
Scott: Beyond that, if you do those things.

782
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:57,310
Scott: There's some other small things, but those are the big ones.

783
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:01,515
Rym: I think a lot of people are going to try to say like, "Oh, but I have specialized use

784
00:48:01,555 --> 00:48:01,835
Rym: case.".

785
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:02,977
Rym: No, you don't.

786
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,660
Rym: Here's why I think we can cut a bunch of those out.

787
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,364
Rym: So for example, say there is a shared phone that's used for like on-call stuff at a job.

788
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:12,886
Rym: One, every user of that phone should have their own profile.

789
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:14,607
Rym: Smartphones support that.

790
00:48:14,707 --> 00:48:15,948
Rym: Like that's just built in.

791
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:19,671
Rym: You can have separate users accounts just like a computer.

792
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:30,440
Rym: Or if it is truly a shared device, then nothing that ever happens on that device should be expected to be private among all the people who are authorized to use that device.

793
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:41,492
Scott: Also, that would be a company device managed by MDM that would only have a few apps on it that even work and would only connect like a VPN all the time to the works network.

794
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:47,500
Scott: And anything that's on it would be information that all the employees using it would need to see.

795
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:47,960
Scott: Right.

796
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:52,827
Scott: It's like if you're on call for like tech support, you want to see what the previous support person was messaging.

797
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:53,107
Scott: Right.

798
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:56,071
Scott: So you might have to pick up some of their cases, you know.

799
00:48:56,292 --> 00:49:02,500
Scott: And it shouldn't matter because as long as no non-company people access the device, you're all good.

800
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:06,927
Scott: And it's up to the company's IT department to manage that with the MDM and whatnot.

801
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:10,572
Scott: So you can't as an employee, you don't have to worry about that.

802
00:49:10,932 --> 00:49:14,658
Scott: And if you're the IT department, manage your devices properly.

803
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:15,980
Scott: That's out of the scope of this episode.

804
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:16,761
Scott: Exactly.

805
00:49:16,781 --> 00:49:26,100
Rym: A lot of the edge cases people are going to come up with are work related stuff, which either your company is doing things wrong or why are you doing personal things on a company device?

806
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,020
Scott: Right.

807
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,201
Scott: Okay.

808
00:49:27,221 --> 00:49:31,511
Scott: Let's say, you know, you are low income, right?

809
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:35,260
Scott: And you can only afford one phone, but there are two adults in the house.

810
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:35,920
Scott: Two profiles.

811
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,158
Scott: And you're sharing this one.

812
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:37,260
Scott: Yeah.

813
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,220
Rym: And the things that you can't split.

814
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:42,020
Scott: You log out of the phone and the other person logs into the phone.

815
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:54,080
Rym: And the things that you can't split, like SMS goes to the phone, no matter who's logged in, you both have to be fully aware of the fact that you can both see everything, say it out loud and agree to it up front.

816
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:55,220
Scott: Yeah.

817
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:01,740
Scott: I mean, one thing I don't think the iPhone actually supports like completely having two total system profiles.

818
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:02,944
Rym: I don't think so.

819
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:04,870
Rym: I don't think Android really supports that either.

820
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:08,080
Rym: You can't have like a different virtual SIM for two different profiles.

821
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:09,425
Scott: No, but you can't.

822
00:50:09,445 --> 00:50:12,980
Scott: You can swap out, you know, the physical SIM, if that's a thing.

823
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,946
Scott: Yeah, I think that's like it's costing money.

824
00:50:14,966 --> 00:50:15,869
Scott: You're not doing that right.

825
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:17,996
Scott: But you can like you can.

826
00:50:18,137 --> 00:50:18,980
Scott: you can hack around it.

827
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:19,241
Scott: Right.

828
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:22,960
Scott: You can use like the iPhone shortcuts to like log out of everything.

829
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:23,782
Scott: Right.

830
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:28,420
Scott: And the other person can then log into everything that's theirs when you swap the phone back and forth.

831
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:28,822
Scott: Yeah.

832
00:50:28,922 --> 00:50:29,123
Scott: Right.

833
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:32,398
Scott: So they couldn't read your Gmail and you couldn't read theirs, et cetera, et cetera.

834
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:34,704
Rym: Now, conversely, what if?

835
00:50:35,005 --> 00:50:35,145
Rym: what?

836
00:50:35,185 --> 00:50:41,340
Rym: if you're, you know, in a low income situation and you have one shared phone among a bunch of people in a house or especially kids?

837
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,883
Rym: One, it's a good idea.

838
00:50:42,903 --> 00:50:49,560
Rym: if you're gonna have kids and you want to give them a device, give them their own dedicated device with their own logins, just like your phone, if you can afford it.

839
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,909
Rym: And if you can't have the log in for the kids with the kids stuff only.

840
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:57,617
Rym: And you do not ever use that for anything.

841
00:50:57,657 --> 00:50:59,180
Rym: Do not log into your Gmail there.

842
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:01,304
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

843
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:10,279
Rym: So the other side of this is when you're what you your phone itself gets compromised in some way, which is also very easy to avoid one.

844
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,363
Rym: And this is a not obvious thing.

845
00:51:13,124 --> 00:51:21,180
Rym: Call your cell phone provider, whoever gives you your SIM card, whoever you pay for cellular service and ask them to lock your SIM.

846
00:51:22,181 --> 00:51:29,940
Rym: Some companies call it different things, but your SIM, if you tell them you want extra security, they all have some program around that.

847
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:36,099
Rym: And it'll just prevent anyone who isn't you from like pretending to be you and stealing your SIM and then getting all your SMSes.

848
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,239
Scott: Yeah, Verizon definitely has something like that.

849
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,367
Scott: You get like an extra PIN number and they lock your account.

850
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:45,968
Scott: And it's like so.

851
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:51,658
Scott: that way, you know, if someone tries to call up Verizon and mess with your account, it's like it's not.

852
00:51:51,718 --> 00:51:52,820
Scott: they're not going to succeed.

853
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,794
Rym: And just do it because how often do you need to charge money?

854
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,220
Scott: They don't charge extra money for this.

855
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,410
Rym: And how often are you calling like Verizon or T-Mobile to make big changes to your plan?

856
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:06,400
Rym: You're not going to need to type that pin in or do anything with it that often.

857
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:19,680
Rym: This will save you a lot of hassle because SIM swapping is really one of the only ways to compromise your cell phone that is not trivially defended against by just not doing stupid things.

858
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:30,440
Scott: So I logged into Verizon Wireless's website, right, and I went to the security section and they have a user ID, right, password.

859
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:35,407
Scott: They have a home account.

860
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:42,160
Scott: OK, we don't set up account PIN set and a PIN number to verify your identity when calling customer care.

861
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:49,100
Scott: This is different than your voicemail PIN and will become the primary means of verification when you or an account manager contacts us.

862
00:52:50,041 --> 00:53:01,020
Scott: Then the secret question, I guess, right, for password recovery, two factor authentication, number lock, protect your mobile number from an authorized transfer, number transfer PIN.

863
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,518
Scott: Generate the PIN code you'll need when transferring your mobile number to another service provider.

864
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:06,060
Scott: Right.

865
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,583
Scott: So you want to make sure you have an account PIN.

866
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:14,680
Scott: You want the number lock enabled and you want a number transfer PIN generated and you want the two factor authentication enabled.

867
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:19,970
Rym: So you got to treat that securely because that is the primary attack.

868
00:53:20,191 --> 00:53:23,919
Rym: that doesn't require someone to trick you to steal things from your phone.

869
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:33,040
Rym: Beyond that, it comes down to don't go to extremely shady websites just like you wouldn't on a computer and don't install shady apps.

870
00:53:33,761 --> 00:53:36,972
Rym: If an app asks for weird permissions, don't just block those permissions.

871
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:37,895
Rym: Uninstall the app.

872
00:53:37,935 --> 00:53:39,239
Rym: It's probably a bad app.

873
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:40,302
Scott: Yep.

874
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:40,944
Scott: Yep.

875
00:53:41,445 --> 00:53:42,528
Rym: And on Android, that's like.

876
00:53:42,548 --> 00:53:47,040
Rym: there was recently a scandal where a bunch of certified apps were found to have just full on malware in them.

877
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:55,280
Rym: So on Android, even if the permissions seem fine, if the app seems even remotely shady, don't install it even if you think it's cool.

878
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,279
Scott: Like I pretty much only install apps from like the major, major companies.

879
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:00,480
Scott: Right.

880
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,753
Scott: Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, you know, the big ones.

881
00:54:05,893 --> 00:54:06,134
Scott: Right.

882
00:54:06,174 --> 00:54:07,337
Scott: And not even all the big ones.

883
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:07,657
Scott: Right.

884
00:54:07,697 --> 00:54:08,700
Scott: Not going to install TikTok.

885
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:15,560
Rym: Actually, I would say in my professional opinion, TikTok is a security risk on your phone.

886
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:17,753
Scott: I use the third party Twitter app.

887
00:54:17,793 --> 00:54:18,659
Scott: I don't use the real one.

888
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,201
Rym: Yep.

889
00:54:20,164 --> 00:54:21,307
Rym: And let's see.

890
00:54:21,367 --> 00:54:26,340
Rym: Beyond that, the only other thing I'd say is keep your phone 100 percent up to date.

891
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,333
Rym: All the updates that come from Android or Apple, install them immediately.

892
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:30,996
Rym: Do not wait.

893
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:32,080
Rym: Never skip one.

894
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:38,220
Scott: And if your device update, I update my apps, I go every night before I go to bed, I just it's two clicks, two taps.

895
00:54:38,321 --> 00:54:40,817
Scott: I go to App Store, update all, lock, sleep.

896
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:41,340
Scott: Right.

897
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:47,134
Rym: If your device stops getting security updates because it's too old, get a new device.

898
00:54:47,154 --> 00:54:47,775
Rym: That device is fucked.

899
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:50,800
Scott: Yep.

900
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:52,084
Scott: As soon as they stop.

901
00:54:52,104 --> 00:54:55,192
Scott: That's why that's another great advantage for iPhone.

902
00:54:55,614 --> 00:55:02,631
Scott: is that, you know, like my iPhone 7, which is like many years old, kept getting updates until like just now.

903
00:55:03,012 --> 00:55:06,060
Scott: Like it's like I should have kept it for another year.

904
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,480
Scott: I mean, I was just so worried they would stop making the mini phone.

905
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,000
Rym: My old Sony Xperia was getting Android updates until actually shockingly recently.

906
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,120
Scott: Yeah.

907
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:20,600
Scott: I mean, you know, the previous like I think the some of the older Android phones got updates for three years.

908
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:27,760
Scott: But I think the new ones like Pixel 6, 7, whatever is out now are getting five years of updates, which is much closer to Apple levels.

909
00:55:27,921 --> 00:55:30,059
Scott: But I think Apple is going to be five plus.

910
00:55:31,521 --> 00:55:39,300
Rym: And if you are economically challenged in a way that you need a smartphone, you have one that works, but it's not getting updates anymore and you're stuck.

911
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:46,100
Rym: The best advice I can give is, one, don't install apps anymore, like bare minimum apps.

912
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:57,120
Rym: If that's the only device you've got, really like don't go to a lot of websites unless you really need to minimize your use of the things that aren't like relatively safe.

913
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,910
Rym: Like keep using the old Gmail app.

914
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:00,680
Rym: Don't install a new email app.

915
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:09,740
Rym: Avoid going to websites because every website you go to is a risk that will increase over time and keep the apps up to date, even if the phone isn't getting up to date.

916
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:19,880
Rym: And as soon as you can feasibly do so, get a refurbished phone that'll get security updates, because this is a big risk to you right now.

917
00:56:20,481 --> 00:56:25,713
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, you can get like an iPhone, like I just said, 7 went out of style.

918
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:28,318
Scott: You can get an iPhone 8, I think is still supported.

919
00:56:28,338 --> 00:56:29,120
Scott: Not for much longer.

920
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,369
Scott: But if you get an iPhone 9 or 10, you know, those should be cheaper, right?

921
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:38,040
Scott: And they should get you a few years into the future with still getting updates.

922
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:42,700
Scott: And you don't need to go out and buy an iPhone 14.

923
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,383
Rym: That's it.

924
00:56:43,564 --> 00:56:47,180
Rym: If you follow this advice, your phone is never going to cause this kind of problem for you.

925
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:53,200
Scott: You will avoid those dramas, even if maybe you're the bad person who deserves to suffer the dramas.

926
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,006
Scott: You won't get caught cheating or whatever bad thing you're up to.

927
00:56:57,026 --> 00:57:03,180
Scott: Or, you know, hopefully good people are following this advice and avoiding drama from bad people.

928
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:08,720
Scott: Not having bad people in your life get your information and harass you or whatever.

929
00:57:09,662 --> 00:57:18,020
Rym: Now, if there are bad people in your life, all I will say is that everything we just said is advice that is not commonly followed.

930
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:24,298
Rym: And the inverse of that advice is something that knowledge is power, and I'm going to leave it at that.

931
00:57:28,222 --> 00:57:40,080
Scott: Oh, there is one, I think, edge case that just came back to mind, that's worth mentioning at least, is that if your concern is perhaps government related, you're worried.

932
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:46,860
Rym: Yeah, I was kind of staying away from state-sponsored actors because we did an episode a long time ago where we talked about the levels of paranoia.

933
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,567
Rym: Protecting yourself against state actors.

934
00:57:49,607 --> 00:57:52,940
Rym: There's one level that makes sense, but this is sometimes per app.

935
00:57:53,241 --> 00:58:00,136
Rym: Like, Google has a "I am a person who might be at risk of foreign governments fucking with me" mode.

936
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,700
Rym: you can put your Google account in.

937
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:09,800
Rym: It makes it a real pain in the ass to use your Google account, but it will protect you from fairly extreme threats.

938
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:18,040
Scott: Yeah, so the people that I know who are truly in that sort of, you know, national security situation, they don't use smartphones at all.

939
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,020
Scott: They avoid the situation that way, and that's understandable and a good idea.

940
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:31,920
Rym: Yeah, well depending on the threat profile, you might have a smartphone that you turn off and put somewhere when you go to your job or do whatever it is you're doing.

941
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,519
Rym: A lot of jobs, you leave your smartphone at a desk before you go in.

942
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,104
Scott: Right, all the job stuff is done on a different phone, yeah.

943
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:47,060
Scott: Anyway, but the point is that in that situation where you're worried about some state-sponsored actor, either your state or another state, accessing your stuff, right?

944
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:52,920
Scott: The stuff that they're going to be able to access isn't really the stuff that's on your phone, even if the police take it.

945
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,890
Scott: If you lock it the way we said and it's updated, it will be mostly difficult for them to get into it.

946
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:04,680
Scott: I'm guessing the odds of the police, if they took my phone, they're probably going to type in 10 passwords and erase the phone.

947
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,240
Scott: That's probably the most likely scenario.

948
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:16,740
Rym: And while there are likely ways to eventually break into an Apple phone that has had that problem, even a newer one, those resources are not going to be expended on most targets.

949
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:22,960
Scott: Yeah, I'm not an important enough target for them to put in the work to break into the phone, right?

950
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,306
Rym: But that does lead to one last piece of advice.

951
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:31,560
Rym: If you lose your phone, even if you suspect- Erase it remotely immediately.

952
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:40,716
Rym: Even if you suspect you will find it soon, just fucking erase it, use the tool, Android has a tool, Apple has a tool, fuck that phone immediately.

953
00:59:41,116 --> 00:59:43,100
Rym: If you find it, you can always restore it from backup.

954
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:48,747
Rym: The one time I ever lost my cell phone was at a MagFest a long time ago.

955
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:51,591
Rym: I got to tabletop, my phone wasn't in my pocket.

956
00:59:52,132 --> 00:59:58,280
Rym: I stood up immediately, delaying the board game I was playing, much to the chagrin, Scott wasn't there, of the other people.

957
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:04,360
Rym: And I retraced my steps, and if I had gotten back to the hotel and not found my phone, I was erasing it that instant.

958
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,186
Rym: Thankfully, I found it literally outside of tabletop.

959
01:00:07,226 --> 01:00:12,040
Rym: It fell out when the MagFest staff accosted me to make sure I didn't have any liquids in my backpack.

960
01:00:12,862 --> 01:00:18,395
Scott: But anyway, the point is that you're not worried about the data on the phone so much, that's mostly safe, right?

961
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:20,420
Scott: Mostly, not entirely, mostly.

962
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:28,818
Scott: But data that's in the cloud is not so safe from the state who can maybe subpoena it or convince the company to give it to them or who knows what, right?

963
01:00:28,898 --> 01:00:29,800
Scott: Especially if it's unencrypted.

964
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:36,214
Scott: So if there is unencrypted data in the cloud, I mean, that's not really a phone concern anymore.

965
01:00:36,274 --> 01:00:38,760
Scott: Now it's just a general personal data security issue.

966
01:00:39,241 --> 01:00:42,565
Scott: But you have to be aware of, for example, iMessage, right?

967
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:46,070
Scott: iMessage is end-to-end encrypted, right?

968
01:00:46,151 --> 01:00:52,640
Scott: So nobody can intercept an iMessage message in transit and read it except for you or the other person talking, right?

969
01:00:53,801 --> 01:00:55,868
Scott: You know, if it's on your phone, it's encrypted.

970
01:00:55,908 --> 01:00:59,580
Scott: If anyone breaks into your phone, they can't read your iMessages unless they can unlock your phone.

971
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,384
Scott: Yep.

972
01:01:00,505 --> 01:01:02,940
Rym: When I need to communicate securely, I use Signal.

973
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:04,000
Scott: Right.

974
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:19,514
Scott: But if you use iMessage and you also use iCloud backup to backup your phone and you backup your iMessage, the iCloud backup of your iMessage is not so encrypted.

975
01:01:19,694 --> 01:01:26,800
Scott: in a way Apple could read those messages, which means the government could read those messages if they forced Apple to give them to them.

976
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:48,260
Scott: So you might want -- you have to research all your individual apps for how they handle cloud data, what's encrypted, what's not, right, and only send sensitive messages using means, right, that will be entirely encrypted the whole way and never stored anywhere in an unencrypted accessible fashion, right?

977
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:51,983
Scott: Maybe if you're -- iMessage is just one example, right?

978
01:01:52,224 --> 01:02:03,074
Scott: You might be in a situation where you feel that you're okay using iMessage, but you tell iCloud -- you either turn off iCloud backups or you tell the phone not to backup iMessage, which might suck

979
01:02:03,574 --> 01:02:03,654
Rym: if

980
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:09,920
Scott: your phone has to be erased or breaks and then you load backups and you lose all your history of messages.

981
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:17,928
Rym: But if the threat profile to you is high enough -- like in Signal, say I were communicating in a way that was threatening.

982
01:02:18,688 --> 01:02:22,032
Rym: While my normal life, I keep archives of every conversation I ever have.

983
01:02:22,052 --> 01:02:28,179
Rym: Like I have the ICQ, I have logs going back to like -- I have the first conversation I ever had with Scott online, archived.

984
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:28,820
Rym: I have everything.

985
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,763
Rym: But you know what I don't have?

986
01:02:31,465 --> 01:02:36,255
Rym: I do not have Signal messages because those delete themselves 48 hours after I read them.

987
01:02:36,556 --> 01:02:38,280
Rym: or if I don't read them 48 hours, they're gone.

988
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:40,682
Scott: So that's it.

989
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:47,609
Scott: Do mostly the basic things we talked about earlier and avoid the dramas of those very real anecdotes.

990
01:02:47,649 --> 01:02:58,040
Scott: I sort of gave as few details as possible to protect the innocent and the guilty, but those are real anecdotes that these things are happening frequently.

991
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:06,491
Scott: Do not be -- I don't want to blame any victims, but avoid being the victim.

992
01:03:07,433 --> 01:03:11,258
Scott: It might be a pain in the ass to deal with your phone, typing in passwords all the time.

993
01:03:11,778 --> 01:03:12,760
Scott: Just trust me, do it.

994
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,206
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

995
01:03:21,246 --> 01:03:26,240
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

996
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:31,620
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

997
01:03:31,901 --> 01:03:34,588
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

998
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:38,780
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

999
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,688
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1000
01:03:44,108 --> 01:03:47,194
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1001
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:50,260
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1002
01:03:50,520 --> 01:04:08,839
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, LinkyG, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names, Case Care Makes Music, Chris Haddad, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex Finn, Joel Hayes, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harl.

1003
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:10,300
Rym: Stop all the downloading.

1004
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:18,220
Rym: The next station is Finch West, Finch West Station, and a bunch of people who have chosen to give us like a dollar because frankly we don't need the money that much.

1005
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:33,960
Rym: But yeah, so the reference that was stuck in my head is from an old episode of Portlandia, a show that Scott would neither appreciate nor watch at any point in his life, where "cacao" is the safe word that the two weirdos use in an extended comedy skit.

1006
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,679
Rym: So I simply leave you tonight with something that is not that comedy skit.

1007
01:04:41,785 --> 01:04:43,439
Rym: Mire of the North!

1008
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,856
Rym: Swaft through the spurts!

1009
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,956
Rym: Dying on the farth!

1010
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:49,770
Rym: Drone in the turf!

1011
01:04:55,131 --> 01:04:56,308
Scott: Drone in the judge bank!

1012
01:04:59,751 --> 01:05:01,068
Scott: Drone in the judge bank!

1013
01:05:01,911 --> 01:05:02,174
Scott: Hello?

1014
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:02,941
Scott: What?

1015
01:05:03,668 --> 01:05:03,769
Scott: Who?

1016
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:05,337
Scott: The Wrangler?

1017
01:05:06,264 --> 01:05:06,809
Scott: Oh, fool.

1018
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:08,389
Scott: Wait, how much?

1019
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:09,433
Scott: Drank!

1020
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:11,397
Scott: Appreciate Pete.

1021
01:05:11,437 --> 01:05:12,528
Scott: back on the mic again.

1022
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:14,605
Scott: Getting paid to rhyme and scan the Navy in.

1023
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:17,629
Scott: Judging through the mic so it's easy to find me.

1024
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:19,010
Scott: Mixing rap and heavy metal.

1025
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,058
Scott: I like the early 90s.

1026
01:05:20,058 --> 01:05:23,410
Scott: 91 to 93.

1027
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,285
Scott: And Thrax and PE.

1028
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,990
Scott: I got the crampolo style and the crampolo flow.

1029
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:28,846
Scott: Got these metalheads all up in my studio.

1030
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:32,229
Scott: And get your product fat for ya.

1031
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:35,086
Rym: Get your product fat for ya.
