1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,706
Rym: It's Tuesday August 19th.

2
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:12,608
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,768 --> 00:00:17,320
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight north and south on the NES.

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:37,139
Rym: It seems like every year our kind of retreat to Wildwood on the beach for a week is kind of Pervaded by a different game.

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,420
Rym: I mean it was advance wars that one year when we went to the store and bought all the advance wars as they had.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,445
Scott: That was two years ago.

8
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:47,338
Rym: I think yeah, and then the year after that it was Pokemon.

9
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,563
Rym: everyone We're.

10
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:52,659
Rym: we were into Pokemon to a frightening degree for that one summer sure.

11
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:53,644
Scott: well It was mostly.

12
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:56,460
Scott: it seems like DS releases.

13
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:00,460
Scott: There's always a hot DS release around that time of the year or GBA release.

14
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:01,527
Scott: You know what have you?

15
00:01:01,587 --> 00:01:14,117
Scott: and when we get together for a week And you're not at the beach all day or at the beach Maybe half the day maybe a four or five hours that you're gonna spend some time in the house eating lunch Hanging out and you're not can just watch movies that whole time.

16
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,427
Scott: you got it Play some DS and some GBA.

17
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:20,717
Rym: we do watch movies the whole time, but we also play games.

18
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:33,301
Rym: right yeah But I mean it was Pokemon this year could be summed up in two words sieve for oh My gosh did I play a lot of sieve for I didn't actually play sieve for I was mostly playing on my DS Cuz.

19
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:33,805
Scott: I have that.

20
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:34,993
Rym: you and Pete were the weirdos.

21
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,327
Rym: you were playing edger in odd Oh, and he was playing Pokemon.

22
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:39,149
Rym: heat is a year behind.

23
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,528
Rym: the thing is Pete admitted that the only reason he was playing Pokemon is Because he's stupid for one.

24
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,696
Scott: well, okay, so check this out check this out.

25
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:47,700
Rym: He didn't have a laptop.

26
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:49,372
Scott: Well, I know he doesn't have a laptop.

27
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:50,480
Scott: him and Scott Johnson need laptops.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,380
Scott: But the thing is Pete stupid as he was used his master ball to catch dialga Which you can catch at the regular pokeball.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,660
Rym: It's so funny thing is because I didn't know this but apparently everyone else in the crew did so at one point.

30
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:05,286
Rym: I'm like Pete.

31
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:07,395
Rym: It's really easy to catch mess for it.

32
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:08,740
Rym: What do you put the fuck are you doing?

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,806
Scott: Just use the master ball, and he's.

34
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:18,549
Rym: he looks at me, and he it was like a child confessing to a priest He bows his head and shamefully and almost under his breath.

35
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:23,375
Rym: He said I Already used it to which I said what on a fucking geodude.

36
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,638
Scott: Yeah That's a good joke.

37
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:28,160
Scott: Six years can't lose.

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,617
Rym: And he's like no I used it on Palkia or whatever.

39
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:35,265
Scott: you know whatever You know.

40
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:37,140
Scott: probably cuz I can understand you get to it.

41
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,927
Scott: You know it's the real important Pokemon.

42
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:41,436
Scott: you think it's gonna be hard to know how games like that work.

43
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:42,460
Rym: That's never the case.

44
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,305
Scott: Yeah, that's always.

45
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:51,140
Scott: that's gonna be the easy one to catch the obvious obvious Legendary Pokemon, it's the non obvious legendary Pokemon that are hard.

46
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:55,100
Scott: I mean if you're not gonna use it on the mess Brit at least use it on the magma.

47
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,100
Scott: Whatever the hell it is in the island is after the end of that thing's not that hard either.

48
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,071
Scott: I caught that too without a master ball.

49
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:02,439
Scott: use my master ball in the mess Brit.

50
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:06,020
Rym: He's a dust ball on that thing does ball?

51
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,733
Rym: I

52
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:16,988
Scott: would actually would be pretty cool to see someone who is so crazy with the Pokemon and basically Started and restarted a game of Pokemon master

53
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:17,710
Rym: ball collection

54
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:27,040
Scott: basically had caught and not only did they catch every Pokemon But ever they have every single one of every Pokemon in their box and each one is in a master ball.

55
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:27,782
Rym: I can do that.

56
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:28,545
Rym: I just don't wanna.

57
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:30,190
Scott: I really know I can.

58
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,554
Rym: I'll hack the game.

59
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:35,540
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much the only way In my master ball.

60
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:46,638
Scott: Think about how intimidating that would be though if you go to fight someone in a game of Pokemon right and you don't know which Pokemon they have but you see the balls lined up and usually they're all ultra balls and maybe a couple pokeballs.

61
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,609
Scott: cuz you know Is there their first Pokemon?

62
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,499
Scott: They leveled it up all the way so it's still in a pokeball.

63
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,183
Scott: You go to someone.

64
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:55,737
Scott: I have six master balls like six geodudes.

65
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:56,479
Scott: I can't lose.

66
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:59,288
Scott: Okay, it's enough all geodudes.

67
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:00,815
Rym: No items final destination.

68
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:01,920
Scott: That's enough Pokemon time.

69
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,700
Rym: I just you know the year we played Pokemon.

70
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:13,900
Rym: I was just I was playing Pokemon and I remember the moment cuz I actually I like that was the kind of peak of my Pokemon fervor cuz I'd never played a Pokemon game before.

71
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:23,280
Rym: so if you've never played a Pokemon game of our Pokemon is awesome for about a month and I remember I hit the peak when I realized wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute.

72
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:24,907
Rym: The hell am I doing?

73
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:28,060
Rym: and I pretty much stopped playing was the fifth night at the shore.

74
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:31,219
Rym: We were trying to watch I think sars wars again.

75
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:32,706
Scott: I don't remember.

76
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:34,053
Rym: We were watching sars wars.

77
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:43,313
Rym: I think and I was Frantically trying to level up my something or other to get the points to do the whatever And I looked at myself, and I just ripped the game out.

78
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:44,620
Rym: I didn't play it again for like a week.

79
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:46,487
Scott: Yeah, I'd played it.

80
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:47,129
Scott: I beat it.

81
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:47,752
Scott: I caught.

82
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,920
Scott: you know all the things that are obvious.

83
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,650
Scott: I didn't go to the store to get you know.

84
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,119
Scott: the ones need to go to Toys R Us or?

85
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,239
Rym: no?

86
00:04:53,582 --> 00:05:03,340
Rym: No, and but watching Pete play that Pokemon It was kind of like I imagined is the feeling that a lifelong alcoholic has when he's finally given it up.

87
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,640
Rym: He's kicked the habit, and he's sitting in a bar watching someone drink himself into a stupor.

88
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:16,067
Scott: Yeah, it's just while he's at four, but I'm playing Etrian Odyssey - which is sort of this torture Did I talk about on the show before?

89
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,112
Rym: I think you mentioned that you were.

90
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:17,715
Rym: I think I mentioned.

91
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:21,965
Scott: I was thinking about getting it But anyway, but before I got it I was torn on it.

92
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:37,168
Scott: cuz on the one hand it's an awesome maze game and on the other hand it's a JRPG leveling up game, and I'm playing it now, and you know what it's half maze game half JRPG questing game And it's just like I thought it was gonna be this

93
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:40,100
Rym: one of those games where it's just good enough to keep you playing.

94
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,984
Scott: Pretty much I might.

95
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,620
Scott: I've been on the verge of not being able to tolerate it a couple times.

96
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:53,880
Scott: One time game facts saved it right, but now it's sort of like I couldn't beat this boss So I couldn't go to any new areas, so I couldn't do any more amazing.

97
00:05:54,644 --> 00:06:00,340
Scott: So then I Got on game facts to help me beat a couple quests real quick that were real easy and took almost no effort.

98
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,268
Scott: And then I was able to beat the boss.

99
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:12,380
Scott: and now a whole nother level of the game has opened up And it's super amazing, and I'm like oh, man, so I think the game is pretty much like every five floors.

100
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:14,219
Scott: It's gonna throw another boss at me.

101
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,574
Rym: I think the only reason why that game wouldn't like I'm not gonna make the.

102
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:22,238
Rym: I mean I'll play it so we can talk about it, but I know why the game will not draw me in.

103
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:28,980
Rym: I Still have somewhere probably in Arizona with all my other junk that'll eventually get shipped out this way including all my Legos.

104
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:36,460
Rym: Oh, man, but I've got all the grid notebooks filled with maps of fucking Ravenloft.

105
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:42,599
Rym: When I was trying to beat that game in the pre game facts days Let me tell you I had maps of like every game.

106
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:56,340
Rym: In fact I still have and I treasure this is a piece of lined wide rule paper and on it as a kid On both sides I had drawn maps of Zelda dungeons while I played whoa.

107
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:59,460
Rym: I feel like that's a precious artifact.

108
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:06,440
Scott: I have the complete map of Zelda 1 first and second quest in my brain, so I don't need it.

109
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,163
Scott: I know people.

110
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:10,460
Rym: where are Scott the silver arrows in the second quest?

111
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,466
Scott: They're in the final dungeon.

112
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:14,052
Rym: where in the final dungeon?

113
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:16,480
Rym: because I can go to a map and tell you exactly where.

114
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:20,420
Scott: Well, I need a map and I would show you exactly where but I have the math.

115
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:21,986
Rym: I thought the map was in your brain.

116
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:25,080
Rym: It is where you can't see it, but apparently you can't see it either.

117
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,915
Rym: Okay, but yeah

118
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:37,148
Scott: Actually, but you know towards the end of the second quest the map gets a little fuzzy, but you asked me any other more easier Questions, I'll tell you right away,

119
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:43,620
Rym: but Civ 4 was the game of the week And if anything I really want to play another game of Civ 4 with all you foreign people because that was really fun.

120
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,909
Rym: But we're not playing on marathon mode.

121
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:46,893
Rym: Oh my god.

122
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:47,917
Rym: That's it.

123
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:55,257
Scott: Oh that uh Really if you play online if you play with only two people and you're real dedicated and got nothing better to do.

124
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:58,803
Scott: marathon mode can work People.

125
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:00,028
Scott: you got to play the quick mode.

126
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:06,034
Rym: you forget you can play with a lot of people if you set up the Every other week on Sunday from 4 to 6.

127
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,160
Rym: We will continue this game.

128
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:14,971
Scott: Yeah I really think the email is the way to go but not marathon mode either because the game will last for years and by then The email.

129
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:18,186
Rym: the only problem with it is that The first I don't know.

130
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:31,939
Rym: our worth of play is basically not fun with email mode But after that it's real fun because then you kind of micromanage everything and because you play kind of sporadically Micromanaging doesn't feel bad, and you learn a lot more about the game, and it's really fun.

131
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,869
Scott: Yeah Cuz then I could actually if I was email.

132
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,839
Scott: I feel like my biggest problem when I played the real-time.

133
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,200
Scott: well Real-time game right is that on every turn?

134
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,580
Scott: I just sort of want to get forward quicker.

135
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:50,487
Rym: So I won't take my time and actually look at everything because if you do take your time you get that rumble on the Skype Of take your turn take your turn.

136
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:51,029
Rym: Oh my god.

137
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:52,977
Rym: Take your turn Bevagon fuck fuck fuck

138
00:08:53,037 --> 00:09:08,474
Scott: right, so If I was playing an email game, I could spend like a good 10 minutes a day looking at every single city managing every single unit into the exact right spot Examining all the territories looking at my science managing

139
00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:09,639
Rym: all my little taxes

140
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:10,020
Scott: meters.

141
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:10,763
Rym: See the thing is.

142
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:11,828
Scott: and then all

143
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:16,629
Rym: you have to do is play the game a little bit like play it more than you Have now and you'll just do that automatically without thinking

144
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,123
Scott: the same thing as I never did those things in sieve - which I played For years and years and years

145
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:28,028
Rym: you always played sieve - in the I'm on an island by myself with all the land and everyone Else is on a tiny island together dying.

146
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:28,730
Scott: Yes.

147
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:29,492
Rym: Yes.

148
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:30,676
Rym: Yes thing is I think.

149
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:32,040
Rym: I think I beat the game.

150
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,920
Scott: I got like 16,000 nor excited and put them on a tiny island together dying.

151
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:46,696
Scott: I put each of them on a separate island so that way none of them could possibly get any more land and Because they were on a single square they you know couldn't get any production to build any boat.

152
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:51,265
Scott: You would make a terrible God Except for my people.

153
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:52,570
Scott: know my chosen people.

154
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,974
Scott: yeah chosen people excellent.

155
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:55,219
Scott: all other people fail.

156
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:58,687
Rym: Fine you'd make a great monotheistic God.

157
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:02,620
Scott: and the thing is I'd get these crazy high scores without cheating because I just made a map.

158
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:03,428
Rym: that's cheating.

159
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:06,136
Scott: I Didn't have to go to the cheap menu.

160
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,899
Scott: The cheap menu is not there anymore.

161
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:18,615
Rym: Yeah thing is I Unlike sieve - where I get maybe because I played sieve - so much that I got so bored with it that I'd be like Man, I'm just gonna make a million nukes and fly number.

162
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:19,440
Rym: Oh, that's Bob.

163
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:28,060
Scott: I just make weird stuff, and I'd be just like start a new game and say give all sciences give billion dollars Then just build ten mechs, and then what runner I'm going.

164
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:29,820
Scott: Okay.

165
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:33,280
Rym: But yeah, I kind of want to play some more sieve for with you people.

166
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,800
Rym: But it is not the show about sieve for nor nor is it the show about Pokemon.

167
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,973
Rym: No, the show about bionic commando bitches.

168
00:10:40,034 --> 00:10:44,936
Scott: That's right, so We talked about I think once in the show, but you know bionic commando.

169
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:45,640
Scott: That's rims game.

170
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,666
Rym: Yeah, I mean Mega Man 2 is Scott's game.

171
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:49,010
Rym: bionic commando is my game.

172
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:59,327
Scott: That's right, and they're making a new bionic commando game and From what it looks like from what I've heard the the new 3d bionic commando game They're making doesn't look too.

173
00:10:59,387 --> 00:10:59,608
Scott: Good.

174
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:03,060
Scott: I don't know I never played it, but what I've heard is that it's not too good.

175
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,656
Scott: It's got wonky controls etc.

176
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:04,777
Scott: etc.

177
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:11,620
Scott: But it does have one positive and that bionic commando in the 3d game is being voice acted by Steve Blum.

178
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:12,991
Rym: Oh, man.

179
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:20,415
Rym: voice actor of Spike Spiegel from cowboy bebop yeah, also rogers also Roger Smith and Papa from initial D.

180
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:26,438
Scott: Yes among other awesome roles best English voice actor of animations and video games ever.

181
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:31,191
Rym: anyway I don't it's Crispin Freeman's clothes, but he doesn't quite transgend him.

182
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:44,990
Scott: in addition to this new 3d bionic commando game Which you can ignore they're coming out with a game called bionic commando Rearmed which is a remake of the original bionic commando But with updated graphics and sound.

183
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:52,540
Rym: there have been a lot of rumblings about this And I was looking forward to it in a big way because I love bionic commando is real near and dear to me.

184
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,363
Rym: But I Really had.

185
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:58,200
Rym: I couldn't say it whether or not they went in the right direction.

186
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,237
Rym: I couldn't say for sure if they were gonna pull an awesome Or if it was just gonna be the same game kind of reskin.

187
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:15,164
Rym: well supposedly from what people say it is the same game only reskinned yes, but I Think the video that Scott showed me a little while ago has proven that this game is going to be one of the greatest games Ever made.

188
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:20,680
Scott: yes, and the thing is I thought this is gonna be the kind of game Where you could only buy it on like Xbox Live for 10 bucks.

189
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,780
Scott: But no you can buy it on the PC for 15 bucks at direct to drive.

190
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:28,051
Rym: I was already willing to spend about a hundred dollars on that game.

191
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:28,934
Scott: I just bought.

192
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:30,640
Scott: it's that it's right downloaded by now.

193
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,100
Rym: Oh my gosh the only real.

194
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:34,385
Rym: It'll probably run in my laptop.

195
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:35,689
Scott: Ah so this game is.

196
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:37,776
Scott: I'm gonna give you the rundown.

197
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:44,183
Scott: basically you can get everything I'm about to tell you by watching the launch trailer which watch this video half the time I come home.

198
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:46,317
Rym: You know ready to do the show and Scott says hey.

Rym: But this time this video I About had a nerdgasm.

204
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:10,300
Rym: yeah the music they the music alone proves that they know what they are doing.

205
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:17,997
Scott: yep, so Here's these the loadout right it's bionic commando the original game pretty much unchanged.

206
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:21,688
Scott: you can't jump You can't shoot you have to use the arm.

207
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,815
Scott: the layout of the game is the same.

208
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:28,872
Scott: the graphics are updated But you know the feel and the control is unchanged right.

209
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:31,340
Scott: there's even like bugs in the control that are still there.

210
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,228
Scott: It's so you know.

211
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:36,007
Scott: true to form They added some co-op action.

Scott: they added some multiplayer action.

213
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:39,179
Scott: they updated the musics.

214
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:45,122
Scott: They added some extra sort of challenge levels sort of like how portal has like the extra challenge levels You know like.

215
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:54,337
Scott: hey get through this little virtual reality training map we made using your little hook arm there, and it's 15 bucks on the PC, but it's also on ps3 and Xbox.

216
00:13:54,357 --> 00:14:00,439
Scott: if You have any of those systems and the controller you should buy it.

217
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,232
Scott: There's no reason not to unless you're a dumbass.

218
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:04,940
Rym: I'm just or you're poor.

219
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:07,859
Rym: I feel like because Megaman 9 and now this.

220
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:13,559
Rym: We're on the cusp of a renaissance of 2d gaming and like you notice in this video at the end.

221
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:17,330
Rym: They're like Classic 2d gaming right now.

222
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,173
Scott: check this right.

223
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:23,387
Scott: There's a. there's a common link between Bionic commando rearmed and Megaman 2.

224
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:25,312
Rym: oh what could it be?

225
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,538
Scott: the link is capcom.

226
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,080
Scott: you see?

227
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,612
Scott: I'm looking around these days, and I'm seeing Nintendo Pulling the epic fail.

228
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,343
Scott: I mean The.

229
00:14:35,383 --> 00:14:40,980
Scott: we fail for gamers right win for money right, but the Wii is pretty much.

230
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:42,865
Scott: You know go maybe what.

231
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:44,028
Scott: what's coming out for we?

232
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:53,360
Scott: I mean even when there's a drought on a Nintendo system like even when the Gamecube was in a drought and they were like three or four months where no games came out for it that I wanted.

233
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,500
Scott: There was always a game on the horizon that I knew about that was coming that I wanted.

234
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,624
Rym: I can't think of any Wii game.

235
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,974
Scott: I'm looking forward to what Wii game is coming.

236
00:15:01,295 --> 00:15:03,596
Scott: granted name a Wii game That's coming that I want.

237
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:05,447
Rym: What is the Wii right now?

238
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:06,754
Rym: It's a Smash Brothers machine.

239
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:14,757
Rym: if you're us or Possibly if you're not us and you're old it's you know like one of those we waggle waggle game right.

240
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:20,377
Scott: well in my thingy today I'm gonna talk about some Wii action, but the Wii isn't doing much there.

241
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:23,706
Scott: and You know the 360 and stuff.

242
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:24,729
Scott: There's some games over there.

243
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:27,135
Scott: the PC has some some games.

244
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:30,144
Scott: the ps3 actually has some games We not so much.

245
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:33,715
Scott: the DS has a couple games on the horizon like Fire Emblem.

246
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:35,280
Scott: DS already came out in Japan.

247
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:37,087
Scott: It should come out here.

248
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:39,397
Scott: You know I guess by the end of the year.

249
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,738
Scott: I'm just guessing though I haven't seen a date on that you know.

250
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,880
Scott: But the DS in a little bit of a drought kinda.

251
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:49,039
Scott: But my little flash card is helping me play some games from Japan that I wouldn't pay for.

252
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:52,009
Rym: yeah You can touch those witches now, which is just Capcom.

253
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,514
Rym: They know what they doing.

254
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:55,440
Scott: Capcom is busted out.

255
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,261
Scott: Not only they got the bout of commando rearmed not only they got the Mega Man 9.

256
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,484
Scott: They're coming out with right.

257
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:08,723
Scott: have you seen the Street Fighter 4 5 whatever the 3d Street Fighter that looks like the 2d Street Fighter Man, I'm excited.

258
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:12,073
Scott: have you seen that the Tatsunoko versus Capcom where they got the?

259
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:14,885
Scott: you know it's like Ultraman and beating up on M bison.

260
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:20,259
Scott: I mean come on Capcom is pretty much number one in gaming right now.

261
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:24,356
Scott: I declare it so and you know I was sort of just kind of like.

262
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:29,896
Scott: yeah, Capcom is cool But I'm slowly becoming a Capcom fan like double.

263
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:44,533
Rym: that what I was before Especially with this 2d thing because you know like I said, I think we're on the cusp of a kind of not just 2d but a renaissance of Genres and types of games that existed and were popular that just kind of disappeared.

264
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:48,343
Rym: as you know 3d games came adventure games kind of Disappeared.

265
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:51,300
Rym: 2d platformers disappeared except for Castlevania.

266
00:16:51,882 --> 00:17:08,479
Scott: I also recently read this article might have been on kataku or something where they were talking about how Capcom has a system that they develop on like the way they program their stuff to where they make games on the Capcom thing And it makes doing cross-platform stuff real easy

267
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,321
Rym: Which

268
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,630
Scott: is not part of why Capcom is so wicked.

269
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,740
Scott: awesome is then they can get these cross-platform things to work.

270
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:24,540
Scott: So well you know by sort of doing this separation, and I'm not gonna get into it's not Monday Yeah, yeah, but I just have comes really good lately.

271
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:29,747
Rym: They're like they've upgraded times 10 because I mean the big problem I had and we've talked about this a lot.

272
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,999
Rym: a lot of gamers in our generation talk about this.

273
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:55,309
Rym: how When 3d came and you know casual gamers, and there's a lot of reasons people say oh it was this it was that but 2d games and they it was kind of like radio where video appeared and people just forgot about radio But it did not necessarily obsolete radio or at least audio because I mean the case in point drive in my car I can't watch a movie or play a game But I can sure as hell listen to something that's

274
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:55,590
Scott: right

275
00:17:55,912 --> 00:17:58,825
Rym: and 2d gaming was the same thing that You can.

276
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:04,620
Rym: they did not make the best 2d game ever and say well We've made them all we're done and they're finally coming back.

277
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,913
Rym: And I I'm so excited about this bionic commando game.

278
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:11,610
Scott: in addition to the body commando game Which you should buy by the commander rearm.

279
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:12,676
Scott: just go to bionic commando.

280
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:13,300
Scott: calm whatever.

281
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:16,232
Scott: The Mega Man 9 right.

282
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:31,960
Scott: I learned something because again I have this DS flash cart that lets me play games illegally that I did not pay for Which is pretty much its only use unless you don't have a handheld device, and you need homebrew But if you have an iPod or an iPhone you don't need that stuff, and I talked about it last time.

283
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:41,655
Scott: Mega Man 9 is being made by the same Programming development team that brought you all the Mega Man zero games.

284
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,511
Scott: now the Mega Man zero games are games I knew about but never played.

285
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:54,120
Scott: they're basically Real 2d Mega Man games in a line of Mega Man X and such, but therefore the GBA and the DS.

286
00:18:55,061 --> 00:19:02,320
Scott: There were four Mega Man zeros for the GBA and there are two Mega Man Z X's for the DS ZX and ZX advent.

287
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:07,097
Scott: I had always known about these games and always kind of wanted them and never played them.

288
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:20,060
Scott: of course I just obtained them illegally to play on my DS illegal flash cart right and They're all fucking awesome Like holy shit, it's like they're totally the underground Mega Man awesomeness of greatness.

289
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:24,300
Scott: So if those are the people making Mega Man 9 it's gonna be awesome.

290
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:25,457
Scott: I just know it.

291
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:32,164
Rym: And I've actually I've been playing through Mega Man 2 and 3 to kind of regain my Mega Man skills so that when 9 comes Out I can play it.

292
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:32,647
Scott: Haha.

293
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:34,758
Scott: What what skills you know gain?

294
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,423
Scott: You mean you mean gain?

295
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:41,580
Rym: or initially I can say this I did beat 2 and 3 at some point in my life.

296
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:52,718
Scott: Beat them skillfully 2 on normal because people don't realize this when you play Mega Man 2 in the US on an NES It says at the beginning normal or difficult.

297
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:55,931
Scott: Realize in Japan it was only difficult.

298
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:57,439
Scott: that normal was added for u.s.

299
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,022
Scott: Wusses.

300
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:01,580
Rym: well I can say this though that I wasn't the best Mega Man guy.

301
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,480
Rym: But take any gay the average gamer out today.

302
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,582
Rym: You know like a 15 6 year old kid put him down in front of Mega Man 2 and let's see how far they get Nowhere.

303
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:15,470
Scott: well first you had to tell them what order to fight the guys in but Probably I imagine most would get granted.

304
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:15,992
Rym: granted.

305
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,293
Rym: I am a quick man first kind of guy You know metal man for a quick man.

306
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:21,285
Rym: for us your idiot There's no reason not to.

307
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,831
Rym: you can beat him trivially with a P.

308
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:30,944
Scott: No you got to go in with the F To freeze them up to take away half his life, but I can just kill him with the P. Yeah You go to do.

309
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:33,799
Scott: you go to freak because you want to save all the ease you got to go to.

310
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:35,455
Rym: I use my P.

311
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:42,945
Scott: Anyway, you got a metal man first if you're not put no because you need the the three at the beginning of quick Man's level to get that one up.

312
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:46,440
Rym: Oh, yeah, so, but I can get a bunch of one up by killing, dude.

313
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,032
Rym: So what do I care about someone up?

314
00:20:48,052 --> 00:20:48,838
Rym: There's a very?

315
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,400
Scott: Right hey we got a metal man first.

316
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,316
Scott: I imagine most people playing Mega Man - if they knew to go to metal man first Mike's.

317
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,924
Rym: next they've met They would get.

318
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:00,679
Rym: no but why not what man?

319
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:04,473
Scott: Because you need heat to beat wood man in one shot, but I don't care.

320
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:06,440
Rym: yeah, you beat him trivially with the metal man.

321
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,513
Rym: You can jump over his stuff.

322
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:10,399
Scott: You need the metal blade.

323
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:13,504
Rym: Hey, don't worry cuz I have my.

324
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:18,278
Rym: I have my crazy best way to beat Zelda that I don't want to get into.

325
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:19,020
Scott: metal man.

326
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,742
Scott: Bubble man.

327
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:21,547
Scott: airman heat man.

328
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:22,369
Scott: wood man.

329
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:24,314
Scott: crash man flash man quick man.

330
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:28,284
Scott: That is the only the one true path Right.

331
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:30,680
Rym: so there's this article that was linked to on slashdot.

332
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:42,119
Rym: I don't want to talk a lot about the article because Basically the idea is that we have virtual worlds now and these people want to like venus I mean like I don't know MMOs.

333
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:48,776
Rym: These people want to create some sort of repository of the history of these worlds.

334
00:21:49,137 --> 00:22:00,792
Rym: the same way you You know save the history of the real world or the history of anything That there should be some sort of archive of things that happen in this real war in these virtual worlds For future generations to look at and

335
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:02,320
Scott: they want to be Wow historians.

336
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:18,359
Rym: well I don't want to get into that all the details of that because I've noticed something very Interesting that this is kind of a. I bring up the article just to talk about the thing I wanted to talk about anyway but Especially with some of the new MMOs and then some of this is kind of being like a retconned or back patched into.

337
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:18,660
Rym: Wow.

338
00:22:18,821 --> 00:23:01,419
Rym: But the idea that people want this sort of record I mean look at Civ 4 people love the fact that when you beat the game or lose It gives you this whole history of everything you did everything everyone else did and you you watch these graphs You look at all these statistics and on this day you founded this city and in this year you killed this guy and all that business and gamers today seem to really really really get a nerdgasm over this sort of infinite statistical information about everything they do in any game ever and I feel like eventually there is going to be some sort of market or some sort of Unified data collection thing for all these statistics and people will have their gamer card that will include I don't know everything they've ever done in a game.

339
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:06,054
Rym: The problem is I hate all the games that kind of require that.

340
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,080
Rym: so I mean, what are you gonna get Rym?

341
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,186
Rym: Killed a rat Rym killed a rat Rym.

342
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:11,752
Rym: killed a rat Rym killed a rat.

343
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,016
Rym: room is now level two.

344
00:23:13,056 --> 00:23:14,039
Rym: Rym killed a spider.

345
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:16,628
Scott: Spider is level two.

346
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,440
Scott: Whoa Rym got eaten by a spider.

347
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:20,286
Scott: Gotta kill Razzle.

348
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:21,312
Rym: five we doing.

349
00:23:21,392 --> 00:23:23,365
Rym: I stole that blatantly from slash job But it's just.

350
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,820
Rym: I don't know the article.

351
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:31,612
Rym: It's weird like this article didn't really say much and kind of went in a bunch of directions And they were talking about the matrix online.

352
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:33,660
Rym: like that was actually a game that people played.

353
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:34,924
Scott: Yeah, no one played that.

354
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:39,178
Rym: and how the death of Morpheus with this big deal there, and I don't know.

355
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:50,693
Scott: yes The thing is is that in all those games right if you want to keep down the history not as Rym is talking about Statistically, but the history as in the story in these virtual worlds.

356
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:51,676
Scott: You know what happened.

357
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:54,884
Scott: plot wise It's not some.

358
00:23:54,945 --> 00:24:03,331
Scott: it's not like the history of the real world where it's something that happens as the result of the combined Doings of all humans and all society know.

359
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:04,956
Rym: if there were an MMO like that.

360
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:06,120
Rym: I would play it right.

361
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:10,303
Scott: It's the written work of the creators of the MMO It's.

362
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:10,928
Scott: it's so.

363
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,239
Scott: it's like they wrote a book.

364
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:16,493
Scott: Oh We're gonna write a history as if their book that they wrote was nobody.

365
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:21,434
Rym: the same time there are player things like When there was that funeral in Wow and all those people jumped it.

366
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:22,660
Rym: that's important history.

367
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:24,911
Scott: Oh, yeah, so important.

368
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:26,880
Rym: or when Lord British got killed.

369
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,964
Scott: So important course.

370
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:42,019
Rym: then again that brings up the whole other issue that anytime someone does something awesome in an MMO like when those Dudes murdered Lord British instead of rolling with it and making the MMO awesome and cool They usually just get super reactionary and ban a bunch of people.

371
00:24:42,755 --> 00:24:54,280
Scott: Yeah When there's an MMO where the story of the world is a rich story that is written by the players Simply by playing and don't tell me Eve online because I've read Eve online things.

372
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,100
Rym: But then I've seen Eve online and the two do not link up.

373
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,960
Scott: Yeah, I read all this stuff about Eve online like the escapist used to write like oh this is the capers.

374
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,169
Rym: I believe you mean Eve online magazine, right?

375
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,618
Scott: Well, it's also a home of zero punctuation.

376
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:10,436
Rym: So yes Yeah, but he's not in the magazine.

377
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:10,980
Scott: No, he's not.

378
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:13,028
Scott: Well, it is an online magazine.

379
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:15,618
Scott: So we kind of is really I think he writes.

380
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:16,020
Scott: I don't know.

381
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:26,870
Scott: Anyway, the point is is that they talk about all these things that happen in Eve online supposedly syndicates stealing from each other insiders spying right Anyone I've ever watched play.

382
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:29,000
Scott: Eve online has a spaceship.

383
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:45,318
Scott: They fly around to asteroids mining them and then they bring the rocks back and sell them and repeat They basically go around mining for rocks on asteroids and meteors or whatever and selling them what they mined Over and over and over to get lots of money and that's all the people do.

384
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,846
Scott: so Don't give me that this shit is going on.

385
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:52,640
Scott: It might be but the people playing the game are mining rocks to get money.

386
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,865
Scott: They're not doing shit.

387
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:57,420
Rym: I just I still feel like gamers want this stuff.

388
00:25:57,464 --> 00:26:06,961
Rym: I mean I remember back when in the kind of heyday of quake one quake two FPS is you'd go to the CLQ and It would gather statistics from every quake server You've played.

389
00:26:07,002 --> 00:26:16,340
Rym: on any quake server your stats and what you did would end up there and it was kind of the Definitive record of who was awesome and actually not that many people gamed it back then.

390
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:21,830
Rym: I don't know if it was because people just didn't think to or did Your own server set up a bot that stands there.

391
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,275
Scott: shoot it a thousand times.

392
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:24,860
Scott: You got a thousand frags.

393
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:33,502
Rym: I did that by accident once we were kind of playing around just like messing around like I hosted a server and a few of us was playing around on it and like a Million points.

394
00:26:33,563 --> 00:26:37,960
Rym: if you do this and blowing stuff up and millions of Bob you just set up your own server.

395
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,248
Scott: How did the CLQ know about it?

396
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,160
Rym: I forget exactly how it worked.

397
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:54,039
Rym: it was a long time ago, but sure enough my server showed up in the role of servers and Actually because of that for about a month afterward people kept trying to connect to me and play on my server Even though my server wasn't running anymore.

398
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:56,886
Rym: But the olden days.

399
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,071
Rym: Oh the old like.

400
00:26:58,131 --> 00:27:00,460
Scott: now we have steam that lets you know what the server is up to.

401
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:06,675
Rym: But I feel like Wow This is one of those tiny things that it's not going to kill.

402
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:09,820
Rym: Wow that other like MMOs that come out in the future are going to have this.

403
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:21,695
Rym: But this is going to be one more of those things that is going to be done better by whatever it is that replaces Wow Mmm, and I guess watch out for the game that does this well because that will.

404
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:27,715
Rym: I think that's going to be the beginning of A shift toward a different kind of online gaming different kind of content.

405
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:33,813
Scott: the one the one game I feel where a rich history is written simply by playing it.

406
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:37,004
Scott: the only game that I can see like that actually Burning wheel.

407
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:45,920
Scott: well, no is dwarf fortress And I think if those elements not of course isn't a lot wrong with dwarf fortress.

408
00:27:46,021 --> 00:28:00,691
Scott: But if you take those elements of dwarf fortress to the MMO realm I think that is the right way to have an a were a virtual world in which a rich Story is written simply by people playing the game.

409
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:10,836
Rym: just take dwarf fortress right rewrite it So it's optimized simplify it a little like a tiny bit Give it a good interface make it massive and multiplayer and stateful and just.

410
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:11,880
Scott: everyone is one dwarf.

411
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:15,053
Rym: Either that you know I'd make two games.

412
00:28:15,114 --> 00:28:16,180
Rym: you can play as one dwarf.

413
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,706
Rym: But there's also kind of the world building thing and you know just yeah How about that giant world?

414
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:23,360
Scott: everyone has a door as their own fortress of dwarves?

415
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:26,991
Rym: I like that idea a lot and this have it forever one door.

416
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:31,999
Rym: because the thing about door fortress is no matter how powerful you Are you eventually fall?

417
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,176
Rym: So the game would kind of self-balance, and I just can imagine that is that's true.

418
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:41,479
Scott: cuz indoor fortress You're gonna lose no matter how awesome you are you're gonna lose.

419
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,598
Rym: So you wouldn't need to do wipes you wouldn't need to scale or change things.

420
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:54,652
Rym: there Just might be a period of a year where one door fortress is like the giant fortress But eventually resentment builds and other fortresses, and oh my god.

421
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:56,999
Rym: This would be I would play this game to the exclusion of life.

422
00:28:58,102 --> 00:29:00,048
Scott: We die I would die.

423
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:06,356
Scott: so until this game comes out and we're no longer able to do anything else Let us continue podcasting.

424
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:16,936
Rym: So right along with that things of the day Slayer 8-bit.

425
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:17,859
Rym: That's all I need to say.

426
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:19,346
Scott: yeah I posted this in the forum.

427
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:20,169
Scott: It's it's alright.

428
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:26,180
Rym: Yeah, I just I like 8-bit music and especially This isn't the kind of music I would listen to like on my iPod.

429
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,840
Scott: All right, it's really not something anyone would listen to but it's just a funny video.

430
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:39,167
Rym: It's not just that it's that it's the kind of music that it really brought back memories of old video games because it wasn't done In the kind of like mock, and I supremacy.

431
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,333
Rym: let's make music in the same.

432
00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:47,331
Scott: clearly took you know an NES sound chip or an emulation of an NES definitely an emulation.

433
00:29:47,431 --> 00:29:53,041
Rym: and they do some funny things that wouldn't have been easy to do in the Create a Recreate.

434
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:56,472
Rym: you know Slayer song this was not a song you would listen to.

435
00:29:56,633 --> 00:30:05,739
Rym: to listen to music so much as it is a work Of art created in homage to an era long since past yes, and also to Slayer mm-hmm.

436
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:13,543
Scott: So I was talking about how the Wii's been having a serious drought not much action going on and you know You bought a Wii.

437
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:14,467
Scott: you got it sitting there.

438
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:20,978
Scott: you want to use it for something right then off since we got back from the Well actually that strong bad game came out, so I was gonna play that.

439
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:23,207
Rym: eventually I got to turn it on to play some more Mega Man.

440
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:27,765
Scott: Yeah, but which is a GameCube game Mega Man anniversary.

441
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:31,214
Scott: yeah, actually Mega Man one just came out of virtual console.

442
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:32,659
Rym: fuck that fuck that game.

443
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:34,004
Rym: That's right I never beat it.

444
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:35,069
Rym: I never even came close to.

445
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:35,511
Rym: I need it.

446
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:36,817
Rym: that game was so hard.

447
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:37,440
Scott: I beat it once.

448
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:39,933
Rym: I never saw Gus man.

449
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:45,975
Rym: Wow really Granted I haven't played the game since I was a kid and I gave up real quick.

450
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:51,173
Scott: cuz I usually the game doesn't Really hard until you fight the you know the yellow blob guy with the eyeball.

451
00:30:51,273 --> 00:31:02,335
Rym: cuz I'd beaten Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 2 And Zelda 2 and then I finally got Mega Man 1 like at a yard sale somewhere All right garage sale, and I'm like oh man Mega Man 1 this started.

452
00:31:02,355 --> 00:31:03,720
Rym: wow this is hard.

453
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:05,812
Rym: Oh my god, cut man is ha ha.

454
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:06,858
Rym: and then I just gave up.

455
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:10,124
Scott: yep so Was all right.

456
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,600
Scott: the Wii's kind of useless now, so what I get to do with the Wii?

457
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:14,766
Scott: I got to make use of it.

458
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:16,455
Scott: I'm gonna do the homebrew action now.

459
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:17,319
Rym: the ha are you?

460
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:23,400
Scott: The homebrew for the Wii now is actually even easier than the homebrew for the DS.

461
00:31:24,104 --> 00:31:26,176
Scott: Wow you don't have to buy anything.

462
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:26,760
Scott: here's what you do.

463
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:30,760
Scott: I'm gonna sum it up for you But I'm gonna link you to the site that tells you everything in great detail.

464
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:34,692
Scott: You basically take an SD card put in your computer.

465
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:46,891
Scott: on the SD card you put these files You go to your Wii you you go to your Twilight Princess save game And you overwrite your Twilight Princess save game with these files right.

466
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:54,973
Scott: then you open up Twilight Princess and load the fake Save game and of course this vulnerability as buffer overflow and the Twilight Princess.

467
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:56,076
Scott: and now the.

468
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:10,374
Scott: you know the the save game Basically got root and now you know writes itself You know runs whatever it wants on the Wii and it installs the homebrew channel And then the homebrew channel can do whatever it wants because it's a channel right.

469
00:32:10,615 --> 00:32:11,900
Scott: so it does all sorts of stuff.

470
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:24,260
Scott: The reason is the thing of the day because I think I may have talked about it on the show before I remember is Because they have recently added to the homebrew channel DVD playback with M player whoa.

471
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:48,799
Scott: So if you put this homebrew channel in with the DVD X and M player you can then put a DVD in your Wii and Play that DVD in M player on the Wii Using your we motors the remote control the on-screen display and for anyone who doesn't have you know computer and plugged into the TV and Maybe has a standalone DVD player taking up a lot of space next to their Wii.

472
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:59,367
Scott: now your Wii can be DVD player and you'll save a lot of room and It's a good idea because it doesn't you know just need an SD card and a Wii.

473
00:32:59,547 --> 00:32:59,827
Scott: That's it.

474
00:33:00,388 --> 00:33:00,649
Rym: Okay.

475
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:05,960
Rym: Yeah, I Look forward to playing with this and not having to do any of the setup because it sounds like it's pretty easy.

476
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:07,118
Scott: It's stupidly easy.

477
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:11,239
Scott: The only thing I'm worried about is will I lose my Twilight Princess save game?

478
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:13,595
Scott: Because I did beat it and I have it saved at the end.

479
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:15,844
Rym: Do you care a Tiny bit.

480
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:16,709
Rym: Can you back it up?

481
00:33:17,373 --> 00:33:17,715
Scott: I'm gonna.

482
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:27,660
Scott: I'm gonna back it up But I wonder if I overwrite the existing or the save game again Like I could back up the save game to an SD card, right and just put that aside.

483
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:33,554
Rym: Whether or not you lose your save game is available online in information form.

484
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:38,650
Rym: I'm sure I'm sure there's some bulletin board Where someone said will I lose my save game?

485
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,779
Rym: and some guys said yes or possibly no?

486
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:42,667
Scott: Yeah, and we'll find out.

487
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:45,620
Scott: if someone knows just let me know so I don't have to do the research out of time.

488
00:33:46,063 --> 00:33:47,555
Rym: But there's something much more important than that.

489
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,080
Rym: you see.

490
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,269
Rym: from 1861 to 1865 give or take there was a war in the US

491
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:55,973
Scott: a war of northern aggression

492
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:06,106
Rym: a war of northern aggression and The one pretty much the most important thing to come out of that war was a game on the NES called north and south Not

493
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:07,260
Scott: a huge documentary.

494
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,851
Scott: No, not a freeing of enslaved people.

495
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:13,379
Rym: No, definitely not the establishment of federalism.

496
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:18,918
Rym: You know the impeachment of Johnson afterward reconstruction all that Gilded Age business.

497
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:23,333
Rym: No, no, no, no No, it was definitely north and south for the NES.

498
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:24,417
Rym: Oh my god.

499
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:25,440
Rym: I love that game as a kid.

500
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:26,558
Rym: Oh my god, take this out.

501
00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:32,860
Scott: I mean I was at like some Distant relatively distant relatives house right the kind of person you never go to their house.

502
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,889
Scott: Really, I think only went to the house once in my life.

503
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:36,960
Scott: And of course, I don't know these people.

504
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,000
Scott: I don't care about these people.

505
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,934
Scott: I spent my time playing on their NES because that's what you do.

506
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,683
Scott: when you went to another kids house He didn't know.

507
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:44,592
Scott: you found their NES and you played the games.

508
00:34:44,612 --> 00:34:50,560
Scott: They had you never seen before And one of the games they had was north and south and I was playing it and I didn't understand it at the time.

509
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,051
Scott: But I played it a lot and I liked it.

510
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,373
Scott: and then you know I sort of lost it and I was like, what was that game?

511
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:56,159
Scott: But I remembered it.

512
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,419
Rym: I remembered this game, but I got what it was.

513
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,311
Rym: I definitely I owned it just like desert commander see.

514
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,400
Scott: but then I was at a blockbuster and I saw it.

515
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,063
Scott: I'm like, that's it.

516
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:07,336
Scott: and I rented it like three times and that was the most.

517
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:10,330
Scott: I played it back then But then I emulated it later and that's that.

518
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:10,813
Rym: you know what?

519
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:11,355
Rym: I just remember.

520
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:13,283
Rym: I realized something I miss.

521
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:17,354
Rym: there was something that you that used to happen when you rented games.

522
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:20,782
Rym: that cannot happen anymore and To this day.

523
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:22,246
Rym: I lament its loss.

524
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:24,231
Scott: It's looking at someone else's save game.

525
00:35:24,271 --> 00:35:24,612
Scott: Yes.

526
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:27,400
Rym: I remember specifically one time cuz Kristallis.

527
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:30,840
Scott: You can get that experience by buying used copies of Pokemon?

528
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,203
Rym: Yeah But it's not.

529
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:40,620
Rym: I mean the mystery and the majesty of when I rented Kristallis for the second time because that game was fucking hard and fucking long and I didn't own it at the time.

530
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:41,624
Rym: so I rented it.

531
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,693
Rym: and you know, I go to play and I go.

532
00:35:43,713 --> 00:35:54,738
Rym: hey, wait a minute load and someone was it like a top level at the end of the game and I spent my entire weekend of the rental casting fly and flying around and psychicking people.

533
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:57,616
Rym: Yeah I didn't beat the game cuz I didn't know where to go.

534
00:35:57,636 --> 00:36:06,399
Rym: but and I remember I rented earthbound and The guy's superpower was beer and I thought that was really funny when I was a little kid.

535
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:08,404
Rym: That's all I got.

536
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:17,534
Rym: Anyway, north and south is a perfectly accurate Completely strategic simulation of the Civil War.

537
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:18,600
Rym: Oh, really?

538
00:36:19,121 --> 00:36:21,880
Scott: Well, actually, you know what and that's that's all we need to say, you know what?

539
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,308
Rym: I like north and south.

540
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:27,960
Rym: this falls into the category of games I love but are shitty right back in the day.

541
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:29,700
Scott: So let me explain the way this game works.

542
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,028
Scott: The game can either be played one or two player.

543
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:37,809
Scott: if it's one player you control either north or south that if it's two player Obviously someone else controls the other side.

544
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,620
Rym: Yeah, and of course, we're only talking about the NES version.

545
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:43,192
Rym: I doubt many of you played any of the other versions.

546
00:36:43,212 --> 00:36:43,775
Rym: I there are.

547
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:44,840
Scott: yeah, there are other versions.

548
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,231
Scott: We're only talking about the NES version.

549
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:50,133
Scott: That's the only one we've ever played and it is the Civil War.

550
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:55,200
Scott: there's a map and You have soldiers and you move the soldiers around to create to capture cities.

551
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:57,628
Scott: You can go and capture the other guy's cities.

552
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:03,667
Scott: You can fight the other guy or you can get Reinforcements, you know various methods.

553
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,575
Scott: the south just has boats that come over the north.

554
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:07,859
Rym: No, not quite.

555
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,495
Rym: Yeah No, that's not how that works.

556
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:15,316
Scott: Anyway There are trains full of money that you can loot to get money which helps you out.

557
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:18,642
Scott: There are Forts.

558
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:27,216
Scott: you can go for forts and you have to play this little flag game and There's all sorts other random shit that happens like the Indian the native or is he a Mexican?

559
00:37:27,256 --> 00:37:27,617
Scott: I forget.

560
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:28,240
Rym: No, there's two.

561
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:31,490
Rym: Did you actually play this game?

562
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:31,993
Scott: I did.

563
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:33,119
Scott: it was just a long time ago.

564
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,585
Rym: See the boats were the French.

565
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:39,759
Rym: you could turn them on or off and whoever controlled the territory where the French would show up It was always the same territory.

566
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,040
Rym: Randomly France would come by and just drop off some troops.

567
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:46,948
Rym: But the thing is the game was really.

568
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:55,120
Rym: it was like a whole bunch of different games and it was close to being a good Game, I mean when you've raided that train that was so much fun.

569
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:04,520
Rym: she was basically you're your one dude and you're running and you've pretty much got to get to the front of the train for the Time runs out and meanwhile the other do you get a lot of money which helps you out a lot.

570
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:06,600
Rym: The other guy can also deny the guy money.

571
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:07,585
Rym: Yeah Your opponent.

572
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:13,560
Rym: but the other guy has a million Dudes who he has to jump on the train and try to like punch you off the train to make you fall off and lose.

573
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:17,217
Scott: Yeah And if he kills you like enough times you got you don't make it.

574
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:20,787
Scott: or well it basically if he Prevents you from making in time he wins.

575
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:31,517
Rym: man my brother and I play because we my brother and I played north and south a lot And it would get to the point where it would come down to like the second like one second.

576
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:36,080
Rym: like you're almost there I have I'll pee myself a few times trying to get to the end of that thing as a kid.

577
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:38,059
Scott: Yeah, and basically, you know, they come out.

578
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,527
Scott: I think they like straight teen units to fight you off with.

579
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:45,303
Rym: it's designed to be so incredibly bald busting Lee Frustrating.

580
00:38:45,644 --> 00:38:48,654
Scott: Yeah, so they also have the fort which is a very similar thing.

581
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:58,093
Scott: only instead of being on a moving train You're in a fort and you get to the end of the fort and you pull the flag down and replace it with your own Flag and then you basically capture that place and it's totally awesome.

582
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:01,707
Rym: Also ball busting Lee frustrating I mean, it's basically the same thing as the train.

583
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:03,997
Rym: I feel like alright, I'm running I'm running up.

584
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:04,700
Rym: Scott knifed me.

585
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:05,866
Rym: I'm laying on the ground.

586
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:06,570
Rym: Okay, I'm back up.

587
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:07,375
Rym: I shit a dog.

588
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:10,590
Rym: Ah Dynamite the dog again dynamite.

589
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:13,125
Rym: I got knifed again all the times out fuck Yeah.

590
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,954
Scott: But you could get really good at attacking and defending and it would get big.

591
00:39:17,215 --> 00:39:19,604
Scott: the game would be real tight Real tight.

592
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:20,407
Rym: of course.

593
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:23,780
Rym: the meat of the game was yeah, you move your troops around control territories.

594
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:31,100
Rym: none of that really meant much because it was really simple like yeah, like Stupidly said like you'd have like two or three armies you could combine them into bigger armies.

595
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:45,500
Rym: You see I remember as a kid The realization I had and Scott had this realization when I did it to him the first time we played north and south I sort of had the realization Yeah But it came into stark relief when our armies engaged.

596
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:50,654
Rym: You fired off all your cannon shots because the cannons are basically useless and all I did was one.

597
00:39:50,694 --> 00:39:51,557
Rym: I blew up the bridge.

598
00:39:51,577 --> 00:40:00,729
Rym: I Positioned my infantry in front of the only other way to get across and then I said I am NOT Moving until you give up and declare me the winner.

599
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:03,519
Rym: Yeah, and there's no way to beat that.

600
00:40:04,141 --> 00:40:05,986
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much the game.

601
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:12,699
Scott: the actual battles between armies in the game are a stalemate Unless someone does something dumb.

602
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:17,820
Scott: I mean, maybe you could get really clever if you were really good with that controller.

603
00:40:18,242 --> 00:40:22,980
Scott: You could like shoot them with a cannonball and they get your horses over there, but good luck with that.

604
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,100
Scott: It's not gonna work out in your favor.

605
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:32,275
Rym: Yeah, I mean the computer could control all three at the same time but on the NES You could only control the infantry the cavalry or the cannon at a time.

606
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:33,440
Scott: Yeah, you can't control three.

607
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,393
Rym: So you watch people play just like alright the infantry cannon.

608
00:40:36,473 --> 00:40:37,919
Rym: all my horses are in the water shit up.

609
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,953
Scott: So if they've got their infantry sitting on the other side of the only bridge.

610
00:40:42,214 --> 00:40:55,237
Scott: if you can't hit them with your cannonballs you can't really do anything because they can shoot so your horses can't rush them fast enough and Your infantry if you start moving in on them the best you can hope for is their infantry.

611
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:56,100
Scott: kill your infantry.

612
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:56,894
Scott: Then what are you gonna do?

613
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,600
Rym: Thing is the game is still super fun.

614
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,786
Scott: It is way fun fight.

615
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:10,539
Rym: the fact that the game actually really really sucks I had a lot of fun with it is a lot of random shit like stink just waking up killing you waking up helping you If you're in college.

616
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:16,804
Rym: Just grab a friend get a ROM and play this game and just have some fun with it because I'm also lots of different settings That you can do.

617
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:18,231
Scott: you can play different years.

618
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:21,307
Scott: So the game starts out differently, you know Maybe the north is real strong.

619
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:27,115
Rym: The south is real strong, you know earlier on 1864 is pretty much the north winds and there is no 1865, right?

620
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:34,055
Rym: And you could on the start start screen you could poke the photographer in the butt.

621
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:35,920
Scott: Yep, and you would take a picture.

622
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:36,524
Rym: He'd go.

623
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:37,087
Rym: No, he'd go.

624
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:40,825
Rym: Ah, no, he actually go blue Purdue That's right.

625
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:42,156
Rym: He'd go pretty pretty pretty pretty.

626
00:41:42,538 --> 00:41:43,403
Scott: Yep And it was.

627
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:44,568
Scott: it was pretty cool because it's like.

628
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:51,420
Scott: it was almost like it's like I wanted to be a strategy game But it wasn't actually a. it was sort of a random strategy game and there are all these settings.

629
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:53,720
Rym: You could change all this weird like when you beat the game.

630
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,356
Rym: It's like sometimes the text would just like spin around backwards and weird stuff would happen.

631
00:41:58,376 --> 00:42:01,760
Scott: and had this really catchy Musics, like it wasn't a lot of music

632
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,425
Rym: Yeah, and then

633
00:42:06,466 --> 00:42:11,403
Scott: like whatever the I think was when the Mexican or when the Native American woke up to do their thing Like doo

634
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:14,760
Rym: doo doo doo doo doo the game got a lot of points for style.

635
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:22,248
Scott: I'll say that a lot of players is really cartoony Civil War jokey action And slaves didn't come into it at all.

636
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:26,868
Rym: Nah, and the thing is if you're gonna play this game Don't play like.

637
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:36,159
Rym: if you take it seriously You'll have the one game where you just have a standoff and then everyone realizes it doesn't work and then you know an hour later Someone says like this is a game to be played for silly.

638
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:41,115
Rym: Yes, as in I'm totally gonna send that one infantry over and let's see what happens.

639
00:42:41,136 --> 00:42:45,190
Scott: or let's do yeah Yeah, pretty much when there's a battle going down.

640
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:52,240
Scott: You just got to go for it, you know, send your horses over go Yeah, you know send you know use your infantry as defense.

641
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:55,355
Scott: I mean cuz they're really, you know, try to offense with those guys.

642
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:56,360
Scott: They're just gonna get blowed up.

643
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,812
Rym: I love I mean you watch the game play and it's so like.

644
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:00,440
Rym: the combat is so fiddly and hilarious.

645
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:01,900
Rym: He's like, I'll have my inventories.

646
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,668
Rym: Everyone's like step forward shoot back up sit back Into those kind of.

647
00:43:06,688 --> 00:43:09,140
Rym: go back and forth back and forth back and forth and no one actually dies.

648
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:11,380
Scott: I love the casualties because they just sort of stand there.

649
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,618
Scott: But as soon as you activate them they go doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

650
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,532
Scott: And they start swinging their little swords around in a circle.

651
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:19,140
Rym: Yeah, you gotta hit a to actually make him swing.

652
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,204
Scott: I know it's good stuff.

653
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:25,244
Scott: and then you can either get the horsies to go in a horizontal line or in a straight Vertical line.

654
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:26,754
Rym: Yeah, you could also change the formation.

655
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:27,780
Rym: I mean it was kind of complex.

656
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,260
Rym: You could change the formation of the infantry and the cavalry.

657
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:34,259
Scott: Yeah, now the infantry formation was either three by three or three by two.

658
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:37,920
Rym: Yeah, but not a big chain as you start having them die and you get weird lines.

659
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:44,731
Scott: And yeah, but it was always good because I would keep the cavalry in a straight line You know to sort of help them defend they would.

660
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:44,952
Scott: you know.

661
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:46,300
Scott: that way you couldn't kill them all at once.

662
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:52,732
Scott: But then as soon as I got over to the other side and I was ready for attack, you know Actually hitting people I put him in a vertical line.

663
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:54,580
Scott: that way I could kill more guys at once.

664
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,660
Rym: Sadly, I don't have a lot more to say about the game.

665
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,303
Scott: Yeah, I know.

666
00:43:58,323 --> 00:43:59,610
Scott: I thought we were gonna do a whole show.

667
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,580
Scott: I was like, yeah, it's a great rolled retro game.

668
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:04,019
Rym: I think the problem is it's a great game.

669
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,460
Rym: Yeah, are there any other games like that that are like they're really fun, but they're not good game?

670
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,664
Scott: I know one knows about them.

671
00:44:11,025 --> 00:44:13,413
Rym: I mean desert commanders old and really fun, but that's an ad.

672
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:14,677
Rym: that's basically advanced wars.

673
00:44:14,977 --> 00:44:19,910
Scott: Yeah Games like north and south there aren't that many.

674
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:27,320
Rym: I mean, there's a lot of serious strategy games like gem fire Yeah, or no bungas ambition because I have fantasy empires.

675
00:44:27,851 --> 00:44:28,722
Rym: Ah, yeah It's a fantasy.

676
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:44,160
Rym: empires isn't fun because to actually complete a game of it because it takes forever It takes like days because basically you like there's a million Territories on the map and it takes like ten turns to muster enough troops to take like one of them.

677
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:47,500
Rym: Yeah, ah, the thing is that game had so much potential.

678
00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:51,360
Scott: I really think that our modern remake of fantasy empires would be pretty great.

679
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:53,808
Scott: Yeah, fantasy empires is an old DOS game.

680
00:44:53,968 --> 00:44:55,072
Scott: I think was D&D related.

681
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:55,533
Rym: Yes.

682
00:44:55,594 --> 00:44:57,540
Rym: It was based on Dungeons & Dragons.

683
00:44:57,941 --> 00:45:06,899
Scott: Yeah, and it was a strategy game, you know, we're conquering territories, you know turn-based stuff but there was also magic and mana and all this sort of D&D stuff.

684
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:11,015
Scott: and You know, there's like this wizard at the top of the screen always told you what was going on.

685
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,300
Rym: That was the dungeon master.

686
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:17,111
Scott: You look like an evil wizard to me.

687
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,739
Rym: that's what dungeon masters look like.

688
00:45:22,461 --> 00:45:24,680
Scott: Yeah, it's like this good old DOS game.

689
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,137
Scott: Well, you I don't know if maybe you could find it at like that home of the Underdogs website or something.

690
00:45:28,157 --> 00:45:28,619
Rym: I've got it.

691
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:29,665
Rym: I've got all the floppies.

692
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,489
Scott: We have the floppies.

693
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:32,480
Rym: That game crashed to all fun.

694
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,400
Scott: If you do have if you can get the floppies, it'll work in DOSBox.

695
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,053
Rym: No, it'll crash cuz it crashed in the real world on the real DOS.

696
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:40,599
Rym: It crashed all the time.

697
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:43,143
Scott: I'm sure Just fine.

698
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:48,248
Rym: It'll work as well as it worked on the DOS meaning it would crash all the time Floppities are damaged.

699
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:50,180
Rym: No, the game was just really poorly written.

700
00:45:51,022 --> 00:45:53,636
Scott: But I do think a modern remake of fantasy empires could be good shit.

701
00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:54,440
Rym: almost definitely.

702
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,349
Scott: So could a modern remake of North or South?

703
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:05,180
Scott: I'd like for call me Yeah, if you took the idea of North versus South which is basically turn-based strategy, but it's really simple.

704
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,669
Scott: You have all the units are the same.

705
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,702
Scott: They're all just armies, you know You can?

706
00:46:08,742 --> 00:46:08,882
Scott: I?

707
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:17,195
Scott: you can grill them up to make a double army or triple army turn-based strategy But this the wall of strategy breaks down pretty quickly and beyond.

708
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:18,540
Rym: that is action game.

709
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,705
Scott: Yes, we're done minigames.

710
00:46:19,725 --> 00:46:22,458
Scott: when you actually want your army to do something, right?

711
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,376
Scott: You have to play some sort of minigame related.

712
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:25,840
Scott: Wait a minute.

713
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,265
Rym: Wait a minute instead of going silly.

714
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:33,202
Rym: if we want a little more serious take the ideas of puzzle pirates and couple it with a game like This.

715
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:39,280
Rym: so instead of having a dumb minigame that's you know, basically I'm gonna stand here until you have to poop and give up.

716
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:43,225
Rym: It turns into Posture posture.

717
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:47,560
Rym: now we play a versus puzzle game and then we continue posturing after the puzzle game.

718
00:46:48,163 --> 00:46:50,597
Scott: Yeah, so it's like oh you actually want to fight now, huh?

719
00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:52,891
Scott: All right Well, you got three armies and I got two.

720
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,320
Scott: we're gonna play this action game.

721
00:46:54,340 --> 00:47:00,120
Scott: That's completely unrelated to war but I have a three to two advantage at the start because I have a bigger army.

722
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,682
Scott: Let's go.

723
00:47:00,702 --> 00:47:03,692
Rym: Yeah puzzle pirates plus north and south equals a game.

724
00:47:03,752 --> 00:47:04,455
Rym: Rym would play.

725
00:47:04,475 --> 00:47:05,558
Scott: Yeah, we can do.

726
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,040
Scott: we can do that.

727
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,206
Rym: Yes, we are going to do that.

728
00:47:08,266 --> 00:47:13,680
Scott: we're the turn-based strategy where all the actual direct conflicts are between things.

729
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,567
Scott: Yes, guys decided by minigames.

730
00:47:15,607 --> 00:47:22,893
Rym: So we're going to code this game as opposed to the hundreds of other games We've come up with every single goddamn day.

731
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:23,435
Scott: Yes.

732
00:47:23,455 --> 00:47:26,892
Rym: Oh Yeah, one more thing before we actually stop.

733
00:47:27,013 --> 00:47:30,107
Scott: I guess it's incredibly Disappointingly short show.

734
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:30,951
