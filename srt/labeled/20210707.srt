00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,985
Rym: It's Wednesday, July 7th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:10,185
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:11,890
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,580
Rym: tonight We are reviewing the phenomenal odd taxi.

5
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:26,779
Scott: Let's do this All right, so a few months ago, I guess my dishwasher is making a noise still washing.

6
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:30,679
Scott: It was washing the dishes perfectly, but it was making a noise, right?

7
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,197
Scott: So I put in a repair request of the building like you do with the app.

8
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:35,880
Scott: That's our fans.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,504
Rym: Oh, you have an app.

10
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:37,027
Rym: I just have to go.

11
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:44,659
Rym: I have to get literally go down and talk to the doorman And then they'll usually hand me this special piece of paper like a carbon copy for but I got to fill out the form.

12
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:46,324
Scott: Anyway, we got an app.

13
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:49,659
Scott: So we also have an app that tells us when packages come in all kinds of stuff.

14
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,399
Scott: They have an app Marion.

15
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:54,661
Scott: Yeah, we do So.

16
00:00:54,701 --> 00:01:03,178
Scott: then what happened is the day they actually got a dishwasher repairman like they like, okay The person's coming and I'm like, okay and no and it definitely didn't make the noise.

17
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:10,409
Scott: now The day before the person came the noise went away, so I said listen the noise went away You don't bother me, right?

18
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,799
Scott: So they said okay, they cancelled it.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,067
Rym: It brought the noise back.

20
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:15,769
Rym: That's how this works.

21
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,475
Scott: Yeah, of course, it's obvious right.

22
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,860
Scott: a couple weeks later noise comes back.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,640
Scott: So I finally put in a repair request and so today they said they said oh, we're gonna come look at it tomorrow.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,446
Scott: So I said they're like, what time should we come?

25
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:27,850
Scott: I'm like anytime, you know, whenever.

26
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,558
Scott: of course today the super comes at 9 a.m.

27
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:38,625
Scott: Sharp, I'm like, all right I said anytime come on in but Like at work.

28
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:41,056
Rym: if someone says if I ask hey when can I schedule this meeting?

29
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:46,949
Scott: and they say anytime That means anytime I'm like, all right, at least you're here.

30
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:48,014
Scott: I'm not gonna turn you away.

31
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:50,828
Scott: coming in check out the dishwasher You know, it made the noise.

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,277
Scott: it reproduced its noise.

33
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:59,060
Scott: nice They basically I think all they really did was like just open it all up and clean it out and close it again.

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,405
Scott: I haven't it.

35
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:01,448
Scott: they got it to go.

36
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,439
Scott: then they we didn't test the full cycle of it because that you know.

37
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:10,520
Scott: I got to get some dirty dishes and whatnot, but it didn't make the noise on the first cycle anymore.

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,646
Scott: It made a different noise.

39
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:12,873
Scott: So I guess that's an improvement.

40
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:15,645
Scott: Yeah We'll find out when I actually.

41
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:23,472
Rym: I guess the problem is you're not as much enough nor am I of a dishwasher expert to know If the new noise is better worse the same like.

42
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:24,356
Rym: think about all the noise.

43
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:25,219
Rym: I'll know for sure.

44
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:26,323
Scott: I'll know.

45
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:32,225
Scott: I think the noise it was making was a little weird because it was when they when they when we tested it It was completely empty of everything.

46
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:32,767
Scott: No racks.

47
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:33,309
Scott: No dishes.

48
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:42,825
Scott: So the water was like loud against the edges of the dishwasher, right but anyway, the Interesting part right was not.

49
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:47,038
Scott: you know, this minor dishwasher maintenance is that I learned a few things.

50
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:54,459
Scott: number one I didn't know that if the dishwasher is like, you know There's no way to like skip cycles and just make it do whatever you want.

51
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:58,940
Scott: But if it's in the middle of washing apparently you can just push the start button a whole bunch.

52
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:00,124
Scott: It'll drain all the water out.

53
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:06,327
Rym: I told you that when you complained about the noise on GeekNights multiple times I explained that procedure.

54
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:09,240
Rym: That's the quick way to test if there's a problem with the dishwasher.

55
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:13,260
Scott: Well, anyway, the second thing is that in my kitchen, right?

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,379
Scott: You know, yeah cabinets, right and there's a space between the cabinet and the floor, right?

57
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,860
Scott: Yeah, and usually there's some sort of like, you know, I don't know what you call it right like a piece of welding.

58
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:30,200
Scott: Yeah, yeah, just a flat thing underneath, you know, so that you like, you know, isn't just a gaping space underneath the cabinets.

59
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,988
Scott: So ours, I guess there's like a piece of metal.

60
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:33,792
Scott: It's like all shiny.

61
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:35,478
Rym: Yeah, our dishwasher has a piece of metal there.

62
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:37,346
Scott: Well, I mean our whole.

63
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,431
Scott: it's not our dishwasher.

64
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,060
Scott: It's the entire kitchen.

65
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:47,860
Rym: I just have like one down there except for the dishwasher is the dishwasher has its own Piece of metal that goes in that the refrigerator has its own piece of plastic.

66
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,783
Scott: But the entire kitchen other than the oven which goes all the way to the floor is ours is on the floor There's.

67
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:53,916
Rym: no there's nothing down there.

68
00:03:54,761 --> 00:04:02,520
Scott: Yeah, but the under the cabinets there is just a piece of metal that just goes all the way around with a space where the Oven is interesting.

69
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:08,018
Scott: they just reached in as soon when they came and they just grabbed it and yanked it off.

70
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,245
Scott: and I'm like I didn't know.

71
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,340
Scott: I thought it was like part of the cabin.

72
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:19,962
Scott: It was just a big sheet of plastic with that shiny on one side and had three and there were three claws on it And the claw.

73
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:30,762
Scott: the cabinets had feet like little like adjustable feet and the claws were just clipped onto the feet and as a whole world underneath the cabinets of filth and I was like Fucking.

74
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:33,092
Scott: tell me that I could have been cleaning under there this whole time.

75
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,197
Scott: Look how disgusting it is.

76
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,809
Rym: Clean under there store stuff under there.

77
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,235
Rym: It's in New York any space counts.

78
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:38,456
Rym: Yeah.

79
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,293
Scott: Well, yeah So a I got this new space in my apartment.

80
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:49,246
Rym: I just increased my square footage But I know what I would put under there the sleep mats for camping cuz you got to leave them unrolled or they get shitty.

81
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:53,669
Scott: well be Now I can clean under there.

82
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,100
Scott: But see now I have to clean under there.

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,739
Rym: You know you could do when that when the when the plastics back in place just never speak of it again.

84
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:05,368
Scott: Well, no now I know how to take it off.

85
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:08,140
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying you don't have this terrible gnosis.

86
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:13,091
Rym: Walk away just if anyone's like what's under there.

87
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:17,204
Rym: you're like a nothing nobody knows You know.

88
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:19,008
Scott: just to wrap up the anecdote.

89
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:21,895
Scott: so there we have these in the bathrooms.

90
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:24,040
Scott: we have these floor heaters, right?

91
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,482
Scott: We've never.

92
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:28,235
Scott: we've never used them in theory.

93
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,300
Scott: They could be nice, right?

94
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,701
Scott: It's like you.

95
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,127
Scott: imagine the cold bathroom floor.

96
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:37,050
Rym: turning on see the problem is our building is so warm from its natural Business that the bathroom floor is always warm.

97
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:38,917
Scott: I've never needed them, right?

98
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:39,700
Scott: We've never turned them.

99
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,400
Rym: Those are the guys that you want in like a house that has on a motor hotel or something.

100
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:46,105
Scott: So they're there.

101
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,853
Scott: but we never use them ever not even once.

102
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:53,686
Scott: but the one that's in one of the bathrooms Right doesn't actually work.

103
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:55,393
Scott: It's supposed to like show a clock.

104
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:56,397
Scott: It shows an error message.

105
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,360
Scott: Uh-huh So I'm like, oh while you're here come look at this error message and he's like, do you actually use this?

106
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,484
Scott: And I'm like no.

107
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:04,911
Scott: and he's like, yeah, you really shouldn't use it.

108
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,780
Scott: There's no reason to you have a floor mat in there.

109
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:08,028
Scott: It's like the floor is never cold.

110
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,094
Scott: What the fuck do you need this for?

111
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:10,020
Scott: Yeah, it just wasted.

112
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,852
Scott: He's just like it'll just waste a lot of electricity and cost you money.

113
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:14,560
Scott: and yeah, that's a piece of shit.

114
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,203
Scott: Just ignore it.

115
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:16,148
Scott: and he's like, don't worry.

116
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,680
Scott: He won't charge you if you move out and I'm like, I'm not moving out.

117
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:21,294
Rym: That's good to know.

118
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,347
Scott: He also was very amazed.

119
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:26,057
Scott: The watermelon knife was out and he was like, what's that knife for?

120
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:26,880
Scott: I'm like watermelon.

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,867
Scott: He thought that was really great.

122
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,297
Scott: He was amused at my watermelon.

123
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:37,040
Rym: Yeah Yeah, one time we had someone coming into a maintenance at an air conditioner and they were real excited about all the audio equipment.

124
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:44,410
Rym: Here I was explaining like oh, yeah, that's the microphone I use for the podcast and that's a different kind of microphone And these two microphones work different ways.

125
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,860
Rym: and I ended that guy doesn't work at our building anymore But I later on I ended up giving him the old GeekNights' mixer as a gift.

126
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:54,334
Scott: Cuz I'll buy a watermelon knife for the super.

127
00:06:54,535 --> 00:07:03,464
Rym: Yeah So, uh in that there's a bunch of news we'll talk about some of these briefly some of them longer than others, but One little one.

128
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:07,880
Rym: Scott told me about this and I know more about it than him because I skimmed an article.

129
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:13,036
Scott: Whoa, all I heard was a rumor and I was like, oh I heard this I heard this rumor whisper.

130
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:15,809
Scott: That sounds true Let me just mention it.

131
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,820
Scott: and barely Rym found more information.

132
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:27,425
Rym: Yeah So that the article is titled after years on a weird island the x-men are finally superheroes again and I click on this.

133
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,227
Rym: and what I see?

134
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:32,702
Rym: because usually if I see an x-men comic and this has been for like most of My adult life.

135
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,473
Rym: I don't know what the fuck is going on on that cover.

136
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:43,040
Rym: I don't recognize half those characters But I look at this and it looks like the x-men that I know I see a Wolverine.

137
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:45,088
Rym: It's a lady Wolverine, but it's a Wolverine.

138
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:46,896
Rym: It's a superhero comic.

139
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:49,688
Rym: So it's very obvious It's a lady Wolverine, but I digress.

140
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,371
Rym: there's.

141
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:51,155
Rym: I see a rogue.

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,828
Rym: I know I see an old-school Jean Grey.

144
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:00,266
Rym: I see a Cyclops with a normal Cyclops shit going on It just it looks like the x-men.

145
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:05,575
Rym: I have not seen a man that looked like the x-men in a long time and it's x-men number one.

146
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:09,031
Scott: Yep, I asked me how many x-men number ones are there?

147
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:09,813
Scott: right so many.

148
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:11,580
Scott: that would be a good tribute number one.

149
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,694
Rym: I would be a good tribute.

150
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:13,160
Rym: question.

Scott: Yeah But yeah, apparently, you know x-men comics I know that.

155
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:26,710
Scott: you know, some people have said that they're.

156
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:34,059
Scott: they have been doing interesting stuff lately Even though I haven't read one in for fucking ever right or at least I've read ones recently.

157
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,678
Scott: But they were old ones whoever I haven't read a new one.

158
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,155
Rym: Oh, wow, apparently this the weird island stuff is going on for like two years.

159
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,240
Rym: I guess they were all living.

160
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,020
Rym: Yeah, all the mutants are on the island of Krakow.

161
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,310
Scott: It was all this weird stuff going on.

162
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:51,500
Scott: I think there were even vampires at one point.

163
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:52,407
Scott: I don't know when that was.

164
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,980
Scott: someone's probably gonna tell me is five years ago.

165
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,119
Rym: There's been like three different times where there were vampires, but I feel like one of those was a what-if.

166
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,104
Scott: But and there was.

167
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:01,068
Scott: there was a sword thing.

168
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,198
Scott: I think right sort of thing.

169
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,686
Scott: It was an x-men sword thing.

170
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:07,190
Scott: I don't know what the details are.

171
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:22,084
Scott: But apparently just today's Wednesday, which means new comic book day And so x-men number one, I believe came out today and it's the most Normal what you expect x-men to be x-men Based on what I've heard.

172
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,231
Scott: I haven't read it in a long time.

173
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:29,801
Scott: So if you're someone who likes x-men Maybe now's the time for x-men I'm.

174
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:35,769
Scott: what I think I'm gonna do is I'm gonna wait six to twelve months and buy the trade of X-men number one through six.

175
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,658
Rym: All right, so they have a note here in the article.

176
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,849
Rym: there is there any required reading.

177
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:49,400
Rym: all of the X titles are heavily connected, but X-men number one is an accessible introduction that doesn't get bogged down in this big thing.

178
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:54,054
Scott: Okay, so it's it's one, you know, these times come around now and then right.

179
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,659
Scott: so now is one of those times.

180
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,823
Scott: Last month's your shot.

181
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:12,420
Rym: x-men number 21 featured the debut of the new x-men team at the Hellfire Gala apparently and The team responsible for this new x-men number one was responsible for planet x-men number one.

182
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,088
Scott: You know, I like a space x-men.

183
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:17,754
Scott: that's how the best x-men is in space.

184
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,280
Rym: it is planet x-men space.

185
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:21,747
Rym: Oh planet size x-men number one.

186
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:22,088
Rym: Sorry.

187
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:23,813
Scott: I don't fucking know.

188
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,100
Scott: I just assumed the word planets in the title.

189
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,673
Scott: It must be like in space planet size x-men.

190
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:29,498
Rym: Are they just Giants?

191
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:29,880
Rym: I don't know.

192
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:34,839
Rym: Anyway someone if you care about the x-men you can look at this news.

193
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,854
Rym: That is all I got to say other than that.

194
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:40,346
Rym: It looks like the x-men I know and rogue is like.

195
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:42,394
Rym: rogue is just the Fox x-men rogue.

196
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:46,667
Scott: Yeah Another tiny news, right?

197
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:53,087
Scott: So it's not video game day on GeekNights, but as GDQ is ongoing right now.

198
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,252
Scott: I've seen some awesome runs.

199
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:58,460
Scott: the Mexican runner did the battle toads turbo tunnel.

200
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:00,158
Rym: Oh, I gotta watch that later.

201
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:08,607
Scott: someone today did a Geo guesser speed run Where they had to guess.

202
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,009
Scott: they had to do five perfects, you know Couldn't be off by more than like five meters.

203
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,640
Scott: If you don't know a Geo guesser is go watch it and you'll see.

204
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:21,872
Scott: And of course once they're doing it on as GDQ live, right?

205
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:23,437
Scott: They get the worst possible ones.

206
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:24,500
Scott: They give them a hard time.

207
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:28,479
Scott: They're like, no, not a buja Nigeria.

208
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:37,791
Scott: Yeah GQ is gonna go from is still going and it will.

209
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:39,397
Scott: it'll end on Saturday.

210
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:39,940
Scott: It's gonna end.

211
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,531
Rym: Well, yeah, the finale is on Sunday at like 2 a.m.

212
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:43,691
Rym: At 11.

213
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:44,735
Rym: Yes on Saturday.

214
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:50,209
Scott: Yeah Effectively, but also their YouTube channel is the.

215
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,545
Scott: their automatic pipeline of going from stream to YouTube is functioning I think better.

216
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:54,707
Scott: it's.

217
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:58,929
Scott: it's been functioning well in the past But it is functioning now better than it ever has.

218
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,678
Scott: like soon after a run ends the.

219
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:05,980
Scott: you know The clipped out video of that run is on YouTube, correct on their channel.

220
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,500
Rym: Like it's good to know cuz I pretty much very rarely do I watch these actually live.

221
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,577
Rym: I usually watch the VOD on YouTube as soon as it's there.

222
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:19,755
Scott: And also, of course you can donate to MSF and also, you know, they always have their donation prizes.

223
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:36,360
Scott: if you donate at least $250 in total over the course of the entire SGD Q you gain effectively one raffle ticket at most Which is eligible for you to win many prizes that change over time, but one of the prizes is a kick-ass gaming PC.

224
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:43,766
Scott: But that kick-ass gaming PC has an RT Whatever a geforce 3070.

225
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:48,059
Rym: No, they're giving away a geforce 3070 that has a bunch of shit attached to it.

226
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:49,444
Scott: That's right.

227
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,472
Scott: The computer might be better than the computer.

228
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:51,874
Scott: I have.

229
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:55,917
Rym: I doubt it's better than anything I've got but I guess I upgraded more recently than you.

230
00:12:57,001 --> 00:13:01,559
Scott: It's like it's like a brand new like top-of-the-line AMD Ryzen, whatever AMD.

231
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:04,167
Scott: That's the best one.

232
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,657
Scott: It's probably faster than my computer.

233
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:09,506
Scott: The point is $250 for a raffle ticket.

234
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:10,730
Scott: It's like what you're donating.

235
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,085
Scott: So you're not even losing if you lose and if you win, oh How did I miss this f-zero one?

236
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:17,790
Rym: I got to watch that later snake.

237
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,100
Rym: There's a lot of all tracks GameCube the GameCube one.

238
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:22,506
Scott: Yeah, that's.

239
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:23,535
Scott: but they've done that one before.

240
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:25,645
Scott: but they did Do snaking before.

241
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:26,608
Rym: maybe just didn't watch it.

242
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:27,250
Rym: Maybe I'm stupid.

243
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:30,300
Rym: I don't remember doing snaking on every track.

244
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:32,909
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of good ones.

245
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,694
Scott: So check them out.

246
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:37,308
Rym: I could snake on like One track in that game.

247
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:38,333
Rym: I never got good at that game.

248
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:40,482
Rym: That game was so hard Mm-hmm.

249
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:42,788
Rym: So some other little news.

250
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:53,680
Rym: There's two things going on with MAPPA the studio right now the anime studio One of which is good news, but there's a big asterisk on that good news because of the second news.

251
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:59,176
Rym: So yep Chainsaw Man, which we reviewed didn't finish reading it, obviously, but Chainsaw Man.

252
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:00,620
Scott: I've read the latest volumes though.

253
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:02,528
Rym: Ooh, I'm a volume behind.

254
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:03,793
Scott: It's uh, I think I'm in volume.

255
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:05,440
Scott: I think I read five volumes.

256
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,417
Rym: I think I continue to enjoy Chainsaw Man quite a bit.

257
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:23,507
Rym: And a Chainsaw Man anime is coming and what I'm gonna link to is the news where MAPPA debuted the footage recently like last week Chainsaw Man's first trailer is as gory as you'd hope And that's what I wanted.

258
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:28,508
Rym: Chainsaw Man if it's an anime has got to make Castlevania look like Child's Play.

259
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:29,893
Rym: It doesn't have to be Apocalypse Zero.

260
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:40,200
Rym: That's a whole different brand of things no one should watch but Chainsaw Man's gotta have an appropriate amount of gore and blood to do justice to those two-page spreads in the manga.

261
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:48,080
Scott: The only thing that I worry about with Chainsaw Man is that like I really need you know They're collecting pieces of the gun devil, right?

262
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:57,440
Scott: So if it ends up being an Inu Yasha Situation I'm not gonna like it but I call eventually I give up on it if it just takes too long.

263
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:15,696
Scott: Yeah, but if they can manage to make it something that you know ends after a reasonable number of volumes Right or at least wraps up the gun devil plot and goes on to a second plot or something like that Because it's like, you know, if I don't get a gun devil payoff by like volume 20, it's like Long to hold out whatever

264
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:16,039
Rym: happens.

265
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:24,021
Rym: There has to be a moment where I turn the page and the deal with the gun devil is the kind of thing like in sanctuary Where I go Oh dip when I turn the page Yeah, it's like.

266
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:27,212
Scott: I think I gave up on one piece after like 17 volumes.

267
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:29,259
Rym: Maybe right you made it further than me.

268
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:30,870
Rym: It was the fish man.

269
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:31,839
Rym: I ended you.

270
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:33,584
Scott: Yeah, I finished.

271
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:37,619
Scott: it was like I. the fish man fight was going on for too long So I stopped buying it.

272
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,838
Scott: But then I had already pre-ordered the next volume and that was the volume where the fish man fight ended.

273
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,372
Scott: that Reminded me that I liked one piece, but I was like, nope.

274
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:46,576
Scott: It's in two volumes.

275
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,002
Scott: It's gonna be another fish, man I'm done.

276
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:57,859
Rym: The problem is I actually was trying to read read like a few weeks ago randomly I was reading like a spoiler sort of like synopsis of one piece just to see like oh, where did the show go?

277
00:15:58,701 --> 00:15:59,633
Rym: But and that was okay.

278
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,907
Rym: The problem for me was much like the wheel of time.

279
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:08,085
Rym: the synopsis itself was so long that I couldn't be bothered to finish reading.

280
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:09,843
Scott: I Don't need to.

281
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,271
Scott: I need to know what happened in between.

282
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:12,720
Scott: just tell me what the one piece is already.

283
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,643
Scott: That's all I want to know.

284
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,169
Scott: I literally want to see a sentence.

285
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:19,648
Scott: That is the one piece is what friendship love Draw, I don't know whatever.

286
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,420
Scott: That is literally gold.

287
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,511
Rym: It's the first piece of a puzzle.

288
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:26,839
Rym: and then they have to go after the second piece.

289
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:29,087
Scott: Like I don't care what it is.

290
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:29,932
Scott: Just tell me what it is.

291
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:33,871
Rym: I was a joke in English God, we used to anime cons every time we talked about one pose.

292
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,220
Rym: I would always show the best pirate boat ever.

293
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:41,700
Rym: I'd always show those anime openers the Italian one-piece opener, but I always made the same joke gum gum fruit.

294
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:46,544
Rym: Yeah, I don't care something always stage in a different way, but always be blah blah blah I don't care about Luffy.

295
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:51,960
Rym: to part two the quest for the second piece and always get like an okay laugh from the audience.

296
00:16:53,281 --> 00:17:02,568
Scott: So what I kind of what I kind of wish is that you know almost every store, you know fictional story out there Where there's some kind of treasure, right?

297
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,314
Scott: It's like there's always some sort of catch.

298
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:07,244
Scott: right genie, you know He always screws you on them wishes.

299
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:09,772
Scott: Yeah, you know how they do those genies though.

300
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,387
Scott: I wish that the one piece is just like Immortality invincibility.

301
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:13,669
Scott: it's good.

302
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:14,453
Scott: It's perfect and great.

303
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:15,839
Scott: You're king of the world and everything's awesome.

304
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,512
Rym: It's like one of the swords you find at the end of Final Fantasy 4.

305
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:19,895
Rym: You're just like.

306
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,319
Rym: well, that's the Ultima weapon.

307
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,371
Scott: Yeah, it's just fucked that one piece.

308
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,682
Scott: I hope it's just fucking awesome Unbelievable.

309
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,057
Scott: no catches no tricks is just the greatest.

310
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:28,901
Scott: the end You know what?

311
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,203
Scott: It's like.

312
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,652
Scott: and then Luffy was was the the Pirates?

313
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:32,997
Scott: there were no bad pirates.

314
00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:39,100
Rym: ever again The very end everybody out and he looks at it and no one watches.

315
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:46,117
Rym: He'll can tell what the hell it is and he it just zooms in and it just says the heron spear Yeah, something like that, right?

316
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,800
Rym: So I put an asterisk on that news because I'm legitimately excited about a chainsaw man anime and the fact that map is doing it.

317
00:17:54,205 --> 00:18:02,320
Rym: It's a big deal but We know that the anime industry in Japan doesn't pay shit to the animators.

318
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:13,070
Rym: Nope, like and you got to work long ass hours and poor conditions and get paid almost nothing and like you think that like it's Bad, but it's so much worse than even the American animation industry.

319
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:15,438
Scott: in terms of just work life is already bad.

320
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:24,040
Rym: Yep, and Turns out mapa is paying way below even the paltry market rates in Japan today.

321
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,440
Scott: So it's already.

322
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,791
Scott: Anime is already unethical.

323
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:30,640
Scott: This is like double unethical anime.

324
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:31,302
Scott: It's like.

325
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:38,100
Scott: it's like the difference between the factory where they make the iPhones and the other factory that has you know, Uyghur labor.

326
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,448
Scott: Yeah, that's even worse.

327
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:44,279
Rym: I got I got a lady that yeah, there's another story I didn't want to talk about just cuz I haven't I didn't read enough yet.

328
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:54,095
Rym: But I saw a story last night around how Chinese studios are Poaching Japanese animators by offering and basically triple salary if they'll come to China and animate.

329
00:18:54,115 --> 00:19:04,280
Scott: and there's a whole thing going on with that Which could if you want to animate and you don't mind going to China, you know, and honestly What I'd when I say the numbers like I wouldn't go to China for any money.

330
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,693
Scott: But you know some people would well considering how desperate you might be.

331
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:10,043
Rym: So here's the numbers from the article I'm gonna link to.

332
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:25,015
Rym: so the the going rate which is Garbage tier in Japan right now is about 40 US dollars per cut like a cut of animation 40 bucks, which is basically like being paid like a 7-eleven like hourly employee.

333
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:44,189
Rym: Yeah Mappa is paying as low as $34 a cut right now and In the article the person they interviewed said the rate that this should be which would already be pretty low should be $134 a cut.

334
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:46,140
Scott: that that even still seems low.

335
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:53,580
Scott: Yeah, I mean like a hundred and thirty four dollars will get you like, you know an illustration from a furry fan artist.

336
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:56,351
Rym: Yeah, like the last time I commissioned that doesn't even move.

337
00:19:56,411 --> 00:20:03,958
Rym: the last time I commissioned some Animatics like a minute worth of animatics was like four ish hundred bucks.

338
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:07,986
Scott: So Yeah Seems way low.

339
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,440
Rym: so excited about chainsaw man anime.

340
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:20,333
Rym: But I live in a society and I have to recognize that the chainsaw man anime is unethical Even by the standards of the Japanese animation industry to date.

341
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:28,260
Rym: It's it's it's double unethical Yeah, and it's hard to say what to do about this because this is like it's not like animation or animates.

342
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,946
Scott: You destroy cat McCrush capitalism.

343
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:33,478
Rym: Yep, like, you know often we talk about like how we're communists.

344
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:34,884
Rym: We're not kidding Like.

345
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:35,728
Rym: that's not a joke.

346
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,798
Rym: That's not even an exaggeration in my case.

347
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:56,609
Scott: Well, I mean, it's a you know, the thing is you have communism and people think of like, you know The Soviet Union and it's like listen the Soviet Union's, you know problem was a they didn't have the computers and technology of now Which would have helped, you know Managing an economy

348
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,258
Rym: irrational weird behavior of the?

349
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:04,200
Rym: u.s Did not help them have a healthy alternative government and also autocracy, right?

350
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,848
Scott: I want communism with democracy.

351
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:09,015
Scott: It's like yeah, that's the combo right.

352
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:13,292
Scott: and it's like we've had this You know cold war going on and both sides.

353
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,156
Rym: both sides lost.

354
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:18,371
Scott: what I would argue Yeah, both sides had one part right and one part wrong.

355
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:23,065
Scott: It's like we got to combine the good part over here Right and arguably.

356
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,498
Rym: arguably America was not even close to a democracy until maybe.

357
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,728
Scott: of course Yeah, but the point of course not.

358
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:32,556
Scott: but at least there it wasn't, you know autocracy.

359
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:33,980
Scott: Yeah, it was something.

360
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,549
Scott: Yeah, I'll put it this way is more day.

361
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,937
Rym: I am a communist voting.

362
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:37,500
Scott: that happened.

363
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,125
Rym: I am NOT a Soviet.

364
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,429
Rym: We're not tankies.

365
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:43,720
Rym: Like that's a whole other like weird mess of bad ideas.

366
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:45,749
Scott: No, not at all.

367
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:58,300
Scott: So in some other news All right, the Godzilla thing Yeah, so there's a Netflix anime that's been out for like a little while now But I just happened to watch it cuz I had it was raining, right?

368
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,463
Scott: So I watched an anime.

369
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:02,012
Scott: so going outside there was rains going on.

370
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,260
Scott: So it was Godzilla singular point.

371
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,620
Scott: It's one of those Netflix original animes, right and you might think man you guys are talking about a lot of Netflix original anime.

372
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,591
Scott: See, well, that's yeah, cuz I'm subscribed to Netflix right now.

373
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:13,139
Scott: I only subscribe to one thing at a time.

374
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:19,574
Scott: Eventually, I'm gonna run out of Netflix Unsubscribe and switch to something else and you're gonna be hearing nothing but HBO max shows.

375
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,080
Rym: Yeah, I feel like HBO max.

376
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,683
Rym: There's a winner.

377
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:24,960
Rym: We're all gonna park our subscriptions cuz they picked up like fucking everything.

378
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,485
Scott: Yeah, this is not like some.

379
00:22:26,686 --> 00:22:30,440
Scott: I don't want anyone to think that there's some favoritism here between streaming services.

380
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,822
Scott: It's just.

381
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:32,470
Scott: I'm only subscribed to one at a time.

382
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,500
Scott: Although I am always subscribed to crunchyroll at all time.

383
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,814
Scott: Oh, I'm always crunchyroll And that's because crunchyroll has an annual payment thing.

384
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:41,455
Scott: if they did the monthly thing I would do the same switching.

385
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:48,300
Rym: now Our household is crunchyroll and Disney Plus and then whatever service has the things we're watching which right now is no thanks.

386
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:51,252
Scott: So I watched all of Godzilla singular point.

387
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:53,260
Scott: I wouldn't have watched it all.

388
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:55,673
Scott: I would have only watched some of it if it wasn't raining.

389
00:22:55,694 --> 00:23:03,862
Rym: Yeah This sounds like this review is about to be like my review of all those anime I watched when I was living alone in Poughkeepsie Maybe.

390
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,950
Scott: so, I mean, it's not a bad show, right?

391
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,851
Scott: It's it's some of the animation is really kind of awesome You know.

392
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:17,420
Scott: if you like Monsters, you know, there's some really cool monster animation and monster scenes going on.

393
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:28,517
Scott: I do like monsters and there's you know, the aspect of that sort of like, you know Fantastical sci-fi aspect of like trying to figure, you know, everyone's trying to figure out like why do the monsters work?

394
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:29,340
Scott: What's the deal?

395
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,424
Scott: How do we stop them?

396
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:34,080
Scott: right, you know everywhere the monsters go there's like these red dust everywhere.

397
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:35,107
Scott: What's the deal with that?

398
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,160
Scott: right and the humans are trying to figure it out, right?

399
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:44,800
Scott: And it's also got lots and lots of callbacks to you know, the series of Godzilla movies, right?

400
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:54,440
Scott: So it's like if you are familiar with got the you know All the Godzilla creatures and monsters and you know things like Jet Jaguar, right the robot.

401
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:55,743
Scott: It's like you'll.

402
00:23:56,004 --> 00:24:04,377
Scott: there's a lot of you know, basically direct references that will sort of tingle your nostalgia, whatever, right.

403
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:15,620
Scott: The negatives of this show I think is it a While there's the characters are like some of the characters have good designs and good personalities and are interesting.

404
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:19,271
Scott: There is no character like development.

405
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,726
Scott: It's just like this character is who they are Right.

406
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:24,017
Scott: watch them do what they do.

407
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:30,097
Scott: And it's like they don't have like an like an arc of like growth or change or anything.

408
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,632
Scott: It's like this character is an old man who likes robots.

409
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:36,780
Scott: He's an old man who likes robots at the start of the show.

410
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:41,263
Scott: He's an old man who likes robots at the end Place for that.

411
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,109
Scott: it's like this girl.

412
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:46,700
Scott: It's like yeah, she's the the science research girl, right?

413
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,722
Scott: It's you know, who's who's figuring everything out and she's that at the start of the show and she's that at the end of the Show.

414
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,810
Scott: she doesn't have any.

415
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,160
Scott: there's no human conflict.

416
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,880
Scott: The conflict is the humans versus the science to solve the you know, Godzilla monster problems, right?

417
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,367
Scott: That's that's the central conflict of the show.

418
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,775
Scott: and the second problem in the show.

419
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,260
Scott: Is that the science problems?

420
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,170
Scott: And some people have said I have watched this I watch these sub diversion.

421
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:15,540
Scott: people were saying that the dub is great.

422
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:19,999
Scott: that's what people said so I'm inclined to believe them because they're people I trust.

423
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,467
Scott: and And While watching the show with subtitles, which is what I did.

424
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:33,859
Scott: There's a lot of just like nonsensical science blah blah blah blah blah Right prop for now and prop for now and prop for now and sentences that don't make sense.

425
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,997
Scott: Mistranslations of like, you know.

426
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:40,981
Scott: Like poems like, you know, it's like, you know they're like.

427
00:25:41,062 --> 00:25:55,060
Scott: they got the tiger tiger poem in there right with the fearful symmetry as like a reference several times symmetrical tiger on fire Right and like, you know, that's a thing that was originally in English, but the subtitles got it wrong, right?

428
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,584
Scott: It's like.

429
00:25:56,193 --> 00:25:56,599
Scott: it's like what?

430
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:02,135
Scott: But so people said the dub is actually more sensical.

431
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:03,460
Scott: so that may be true.

432
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,845
Scott: So maybe try the dub.

433
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:10,909
Scott: if I guess if you're watching with subtitles and you get to a part We're like the subtitles like make no sense.

434
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,154
Scott: Like what the fuck did they just say?

435
00:26:12,174 --> 00:26:12,596
Scott: I don't know.

436
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:13,419
Scott: that means nothing.

437
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:17,254
Scott: Maybe rewind a little bit and turn on the dub and see what they say.

438
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:18,739
Scott: Maybe it makes more sense.

439
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:29,071
Scott: But yeah it's like if the central point of the show is like this humans versus science thing going on and Then you don't translate it in a way.

440
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:29,673
Scott: not it's not.

441
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,440
Scott: I'm not saying like inaccurate, right?

442
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,061
Scott: I'm not sure.

443
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:33,968
Scott: but it's like in a way that means nothing.

444
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:34,830
Scott: It's just like words.

445
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:37,138
Scott: you you're not following anything.

446
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:37,780
Scott: that's happening.

447
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,182
Scott: Yeah Doesn't really work.

448
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:47,788
Rym: like Star Trek which was often guilty of that would basically use all those words in a context to convey something To solve a problem and then move past it.

449
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:50,159
Rym: the show wasn't about those nonsense words.

450
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,245
Scott: Yep And then yeah, there's.

451
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:54,650
Scott: no I was also disappointed.

452
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,040
Scott: There was no payoff of monsters fighting each other.

453
00:26:58,623 --> 00:27:00,638
Scott: But at the end of the show, you know, there's.

454
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:03,670
Scott: you know There's always that post-credits deal right and it's like they make.

455
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:10,451
Scott: if they make more of this which I think they might they may Said they were going to already that might have monster on monster battling.

456
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:11,454
Scott: So that might be worth.

457
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:13,540
Rym: I'll say you're into the monster on monster.

458
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:24,539
Rym: Yeah Anyway, yeah If it rains enough, I feel like I could watch this.

459
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:34,589
Scott: Yeah I think if you're uh, I think this is only for people who are like if you're a real like Godzilla type fan right then this is for you.

460
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:41,898
Scott: if you're just like you like a Godzilla now and then you know it's only if The hurricane is over your house.

461
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:47,711
Rym: So similarly I'll geek bite something just really briefly cuz I know I'd like.

462
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:52,358
Rym: I'm really big into like to get birdie and the owl house and All these other shows that Scott hasn't watched yet.

463
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:56,860
Rym: But the owl house is such a phenomenal show like as a kid's show.

464
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,220
Rym: It's great, but it's also like there's a lot going on.

465
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,059
Rym: I've talked about it before.

466
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:18,140
Rym: Season 2 is coming out bit by bit and I've seen enough of season 2 to be able to say season 2 of the owl house just as good continuing on the same plot the back story of the world everything continues to be intriguing and I think it's gonna continue to be a. the dark undertones are legitimate.

467
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,992
Rym: This show is weird and dark and has a lot of sci-fi elements.

468
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,117
Rym: There's fun stuff going on.

469
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:30,860
Rym: So if you haven't watched the owl house watch it season 1 ends in a pretty good spot and You don't have like season.

470
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:34,415
Rym: You could stop and wait for season 2 to finish before you started it.

471
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:42,342
Rym: in case there's more cliffhangers season 1 will end at a point that you would be comfortable with waiting on and season 2 so far is Great.

472
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:46,635
Scott: So I want to introduce a new segment to GeekNights which you haven't done in.

473
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:48,179
Scott: I don't know a hundred years.

474
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:55,126
Scott: This is breaking news yeah, so I'm Temporarily which means permanently.

475
00:28:55,187 --> 00:28:58,340
Scott: I've decided to call the segment second dibs, right?

476
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:03,017
Scott: The idea is that I've got some stuff and it's not.

477
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:06,980
Scott: it's stuff That's still good and I don't want to throw it out in the garbage, right?

478
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:15,619
Scott: But I've already given first dibs to people I actually know like actual friends family close people right and they didn't want it.

479
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:19,640
Scott: So the second dibs are is for the listener, right?

480
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,733
Scott: We're gonna see if the listener wants something that I have that I don't want anymore.

481
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:39,200
Scott: and if the listener doesn't want it Then you know, sometimes it might be something free sometimes it might be just pay shipping sometimes it's gonna cost money Right, but if none of the listeners want it then third dibs is gonna go to eBay Facebook marketplace some shit like that, right?

482
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:49,700
Scott: So what I have for you is the first item up for dibs And if you want the item just contact us via any of the contact mechanisms that we have.

483
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:57,432
Scott: There are many pick one our discord Our forum an email Twitter DM whatever.

484
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:03,908
Scott: so I recently replaced My second monitor, right?

485
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:13,880
Scott: So now I've got two daddy to 4k monitors now, so One of the monitors that I had the two monitors one of them broke and it temporarily swapped it with an identical one.

486
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:14,377
Scott: That was Rym's.

487
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:23,880
Rym: I gave Rym's back when I got my first 4k monitor which is good timing because my Backup monitor that I was using in the kitchen finally died and now I put this one in the kitchen spot.

488
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,940
Scott: So my second non 4k monitor just got replaced, but it still works.

489
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,692
Scott: It is a Dell u24 10 ultra sharp monitor.

490
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:37,319
Scott: It is 1600 by 1200 resolution 16 by 10 aspect ratio.

491
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,788
Scott: Really good, you know color accuracy.

492
00:30:40,868 --> 00:30:43,376
Scott: considering it's an LCD monitor.

493
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:50,990
Scott: It has a absolutely ridiculous number of inputs HDMI displayport DVI VGA and component.

494
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,941
Scott: you can plug a frickin we into this with like a component cable if you want to Right.

495
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,950
Scott: It's really useful to have all those inputs.

496
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,532
Scott: I'm kind of sad.

497
00:30:57,573 --> 00:31:01,821
Scott: my new monitor doesn't have those You.

498
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,446
Scott: it's totally works.

499
00:31:03,848 --> 00:31:09,885
Scott: it doesn't have a stand because the original stand I got rid of but It's basically my mom.

500
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:10,327
Rym: It's basic.

501
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,351
Scott: I put my.

502
00:31:11,392 --> 00:31:13,279
Scott: I put my monitors on arms.

503
00:31:14,102 --> 00:31:15,827
Scott: So my new monitor.

504
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:18,494
Scott: I came with a stand that I'm not using.

505
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:20,640
Scott: so it's on a stand.

506
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,727
Scott: It's just not the stand it was supposed to go with.

507
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:26,380
Scott: it's on a stand from a much newer brand new Dell monitor.

508
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:28,040
Scott: So arguably it's a monitor.

509
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:34,080
Scott: It's an old Dell monitor on a stand that's designed for a newer 4k Dell monitor.

510
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,869
Scott: So it looks a little weird from the back, but it totally works.

511
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:41,839
Scott: So it's honest and it's just not dust and it's supposed to have.

512
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:45,274
Scott: Not bad I can give you with this.

513
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:49,912
Scott: Oh, it has a USB hub built in And I can give you with this monitor.

514
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,140
Scott: I can give you a power cable.

515
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:56,580
Scott: I can give you the USB cable so that you can plug it into your computer and then it will act as USB hub.

516
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:06,640
Scott: Right and I can give you a display port cable that is guaranteed to have all the pins so that it's not going to fry Your computer meaning it's missing the pin that will fry your computer.

517
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:13,086
Scott: Yes, I can give you a guaranteed correctly working safe Functioning DisplayPort cable.

518
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,980
Scott: I can even give an HDMI cable if you tell me you need one.

519
00:32:16,362 --> 00:32:18,940
Scott: I can give you a VGI and a DVI cable if you ask for one, too.

520
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,451
Rym: I mean if you want old cables for video stuff We could hook you up right.

521
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,659
Scott: if there's a I mean by default I'm gonna give you the cables I said.

522
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,300
Scott: But if you if you need one of those other cables I can I can give it to you.

523
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:32,920
Rym: Oh doesn't also have a built-in card reader.

524
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:34,464
Scott: It does.

525
00:32:34,504 --> 00:32:37,460
Scott: yeah built part of the USB hub is an SD card reader.

526
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,034
Scott: It's USB 2 mind you.

527
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:48,369
Scott: but yeah It is a. there is a built-in SD card reader on the side next to the USB hub ports And also it because it has all those inputs.

528
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:54,950
Scott: It does picture-in-picture, so if you plug in like several devices Oh shit, I forgot all those old ultra sharps had that.

529
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:00,166
Rym: I don't think the new ones had that I think the new one might Ever play less inputs.

530
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:04,200
Scott: I've never knew it has made less input, so it's not really there's no point to it, right.

531
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:18,600
Scott: But yeah, you could plug in for example a Wii on the component inputs, and I don't know Your laptop on the DisplayPort input, and then you could have like the Wii game in a little box in the corner.

532
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,876
Scott: You could even move it around or like you know whatever and then have your computer like you can do.

533
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:27,390
Scott: all kinds of picture-in-picture layouts With mixing the inputs together, it's pretty.

534
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,600
Scott: it's pretty cool even though it's an old monitor.

535
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:39,360
Scott: so I bought this monitor for like five hundred dollars way a long time ago that and I just replaced it with a 500 ish dollar monitor.

536
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:44,586
Scott: but it's so old and also the monitors have one problem and That it is sort of yellowed.

537
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:49,024
Scott: if you look at the monitor from like a distance at the wrong angle You can see this sort of like.

538
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:55,159
Scott: it looks like there's a yellow blob around the edges of the screen and like only the center Of the screen looks like it's the right color.

539
00:33:55,722 --> 00:33:59,476
Scott: But if you're sitting close to the monitor just using it like you can't notice at all.

540
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:00,500
Scott: it looks perfectly normal.

541
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:02,560
Scott: So there's some sort of yellowing.

542
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:13,580
Scott: I think what's happened is that UV light like does these reflectors, but inside the monitor behind the backlights There's like white reflectors that reflect the backlight back at the screen.

543
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:17,800
Scott: Right because there's no point in having the backlight shoot light out the back of the monitor.

544
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,443
Scott: Yeah, right.

545
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:21,500
Scott: It just makes the screen brighter to put reflectors behind the backlights.

546
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:29,652
Scott: I think those reflectors Supposedly have yellowed from UV light over the years make sense.

547
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:33,255
Scott: monitors from like who knows when 2014 Maybe it's really old.

548
00:34:34,524 --> 00:34:38,060
Scott: So that might be the problem, but it doesn't affect the functioning of the monitor.

549
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:50,580
Scott: So if you want this monitor, and it's not gonna be free, but it's gonna be pretty cheap right like hundred bucks you think Oh For like it makes God an offer.

550
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:54,480
Scott: Yeah, it's like it was a top-of-the-line monitor right like amazing.

551
00:34:54,681 --> 00:35:00,163
Scott: It's just way old and has some yellowing going on and I want to recoup some of the cost of this new Monitor.

552
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,670
Scott: that will hopefully last just as long.

553
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:06,356
Scott: so if you need a monitor computer monitor, that's kind of awesome.

554
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,865
Scott: actually Let me know.

555
00:35:08,885 --> 00:35:14,180
Scott: yep, and the other rule we have otherwise I'm gonna by the by the next time we do a show or whatever.

556
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:16,178
Scott: It's just gonna be on eBay if no one wants it.

557
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:20,260
Rym: yep And the other rule we have with this bit is if one of us does it the other one can't do it.

558
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,877
Rym: So I can't try to voice this recalled fire extinguisher on you.

559
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:25,303
Scott: No, you'll do that.

560
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:25,705
Scott: We're gonna.

561
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:29,040
Scott: You know we're not gonna do too many at once because otherwise we'll run out of bits, right?

562
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,019
Scott: We'll get well all the shit in our house will be gone.

563
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:39,317
Rym: Or GeekNights gets weird, and there's like the arrow where we were just doing basic nights home shopping club basically GeekNights GVC.

564
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,287
Rym: I Feel like next day for the next one.

565
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,113
Rym: you got to try to talk in that kind of tone.

566
00:35:44,173 --> 00:35:44,334
Rym: like.

567
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:46,700
Rym: this monitor features an array of functions.

568
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:54,023
Scott: It just most of them will be much shorter than this one, but just the monitor has had so many features I think like the.

569
00:35:54,405 --> 00:36:01,590
Scott: the next thing I'm gonna try to get rid of has you know way fewer features, so So in the mood.

570
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:12,769
Rym: actually it's time for things Of the day so check this.

571
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,937
Rym: this was uploaded on June 27th.

572
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,904
Rym: This was a recent video.

573
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:19,110
Rym: I just found it kind of randomly.

574
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,434
Rym: I wasn't even subscribed to this account.

575
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:28,825
Rym: It's a an animation kind of in the Yamashibai style Style and it's basic.

576
00:36:28,845 --> 00:36:33,055
Rym: It's called yokai Bob the Builder, and it is.

577
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:42,077
Scott: it is a like legitimately scary four-minute long show Where in the title tells you everything you need to know.

578
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:42,299
Rym: yeah?

579
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:44,110
Scott: You know yokai are you know?

580
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,700
Scott: Bob the Builder is oh my god.

581
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:56,280
Rym: And the moment when Bob the Builder shows up He just he looks like one of those like yamashibai looking yokai And he bangs his hammer on the ground and the couple in the house just like oh my god.

582
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:57,042
Rym: Oh, what are you?

583
00:36:57,303 --> 00:37:00,274
Rym: and he's just like we can fix it.

584
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:01,318
Rym: Don't you think?

585
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:02,980
Scott: guys blues.

586
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,424
Scott: Yokai Maya the B.

587
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:07,848
Rym: Oh, I would watch it.

588
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:09,835
Rym: yokai Maya the B. Would be perfect.

589
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:13,712
Rym: yokai David the gnome David the gnomes already terrifying.

590
00:37:13,752 --> 00:37:15,300
Scott: yokai Dora the Explorer.

591
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,754
Rym: But yeah, when you see this you'll see what I mean.

592
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:20,980
Rym: like they got the style right.

593
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,804
Rym: It's clearly.

594
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:22,045
Rym: it's like.

595
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:23,754
Rym: it's not anime like it's.

596
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:30,660
Rym: it feels like someone Made something that wanted to feel like anime, but wasn't quite deep enough in anime to get it perfect.

597
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:35,189
Rym: But the yokai part is like spot-on yokai.

598
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:38,771
Scott: Elmo My co-worker took their kid to sesame place.

599
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:40,158
Scott: Oh, we're talking about that.

600
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,058
Scott: yeah So what do you got thing of the day?

601
00:37:43,701 --> 00:37:45,289
Scott: Yeah, so the hockey's going on right now.

602
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:49,428
Scott: the Stanley Cup could come out as soon as tonight Maybe before you even heard this episode.

603
00:37:49,448 --> 00:37:52,240
Scott: it may have come out already because the lightning up three games to one.

604
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,829
Rym: I hope it doesn't cuz I'm not a particular fan of the Habs But I'd rather anyone of a Tampa win.

605
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:59,682
Scott: so as long as I was lost I don't care.

606
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:03,580
Rym: you know my dad was like hey like before like the allergies were eliminated.

607
00:38:03,922 --> 00:38:06,074
Rym: Hey, well on New York teams gonna make it to the end right.

608
00:38:06,114 --> 00:38:06,819
Rym: so that's something.

609
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:07,582
Scott: yeah No, that's.

610
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,772
Scott: that's if a New York team is gonna win.

611
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:11,500
Scott: That's either the best thing or the worst.

612
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:13,881
Scott: It's not like okay It's.

613
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:17,840
Rym: I've realized that only New Yorkers are that weird about it because there's so many teams.

614
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,744
Rym: There's such a dense area.

615
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:21,619
Scott: You think people you think Cubs fans are happy at the White Sox win.

616
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:24,419
Rym: Yeah, I guess that's the other bar.

617
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,263
Rym: That's one.

618
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:27,531
Scott: Dodgers fans are happy if like the Angels win.

619
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:28,274
Scott: it might be even though.

620
00:38:28,294 --> 00:38:29,920
Scott: It's Anaheim and not LA or whatever.

621
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:30,385
Scott: I don't know.

622
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:36,920
Scott: yeah, I Don't I don't I feel like no right People who got two teams only like one of the two teams.

623
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,340
Rym: I mean honestly I couldn't care less if the Mets or the Yankees win the World Series.

624
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,779
Scott: Anyway.

625
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:51,380
Scott: So yeah, so the one game that the Habs have won so far was game four and there was his dude.

626
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:52,400
Scott: I don't know his name.

627
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,631
Scott: I think he's like works like SB nation or does he does like?

628
00:38:55,651 --> 00:38:58,260
Scott: he's like a. he's like a sports media person for the Habs.

629
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:58,581
Scott: He's not.

630
00:38:58,602 --> 00:38:59,486
Scott: he's not just some fan.

631
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:14,820
Scott: Okay, so that's why he was being interviewed on TV Outside the arena right during the overtime of game four By the sports television people and so they're asking questions like you know how do you think the game's gonna turn out?

632
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,945
Scott: You know it's so he.

633
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:17,977
Scott: you know he predicts the finish of the game.

634
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:18,298
Scott: He's like.

635
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:19,243
Scott: yeah He's like.

636
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:20,188
Scott: I think we're gonna score.

637
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,600
Scott: You know if we if we win this one right I think he's like we're gonna score a goal here in the overtime.

638
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:31,659
Scott: It'll be the be the Habs and he thinks Anderson's gonna score the goal During the inner during the interview.

639
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:37,980
Scott: While he's still there Anderson scores the goal to win the game in overtime, right?

640
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:45,391
Scott: So this is like this is pretty awesome video here And honestly like it doesn't it doesn't spoil the video.

641
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:47,440
Scott: It's for me to tell you what happens in the video.

642
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:48,999
Rym: Yeah, but I won't link to it.

643
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,652
Rym: but if you know what the blab is they're showing the game.

644
00:39:51,672 --> 00:40:00,919
Rym: if you don't have any other way to see hockey and Basically if you never watched ice hockey the games that are happening now are kind of the peak of the sport.

645
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:05,218
Rym: Things get different during the Stanley Cup playoffs compared to all they just get.

646
00:40:05,258 --> 00:40:07,694
Scott: did it Yeah in the playoffs and so this is the finals.

647
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:08,700
Scott: so they're even more different.

648
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:13,491
Scott: But yeah hockey players You know they play a long season of hockey which you you normally for.

649
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,380
Scott: like football you such a brutal sport you play less games.

650
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,900
Scott: Right hockey plays a lot a lot of games for something that you know probably should be less games like sometimes.

651
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:24,666
Scott: I took a survey today.

652
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:27,352
Scott: That was like how many games should the season be?

653
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:30,700
Scott: and I chose like half as many right?

654
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:34,715
Rym: It should be way back in same number of day games.

655
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:35,680
Rym: We have tickets to maybe.

656
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:37,609
Scott: Yeah, I was like man.

657
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:38,900
Scott: I was like you should cut it way back.

658
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:45,505
Scott: I don't think that was a popular choice, but that's what I chose now, but regardless hockey players Don't play.

659
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:48,639
Scott: you know they play seriously, and they play hard in the regular season.

660
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:54,600
Scott: sometimes They do play their hardest in regular season games that mean a lot, but playoff hockey is completely different.

661
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,447
Scott: It's like if you go to the Madison Square Garden to see a playoff hockey game You'd think it was a different building.

662
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:07,080
Rym: yeah when you went to see a regular season like a few times I have been in person at a Stanley Cup playoff game like especially past the first round.

663
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:17,650
Rym: It's weird to be in a building that you've been to so many times with the same size crowd and somehow it is three times Louder at all times, and it's just the.

664
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:19,155
Scott: everything is different right now.

665
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:20,620
Scott: It's the same building right.

666
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,061
Scott: say It's like.

667
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,246
Scott: it's like what the heck.

668
00:41:22,306 --> 00:41:25,940
Scott: It's like you're playing the same hockey by the same rules almost the same rules.

669
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,404
Scott: Overtime is different.

670
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:31,380
Rym: Yeah, the old the big difference for those you're on hockey people is in normal hockey and most sports.

671
00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:33,596
Rym: There's a point where the game will like okay.

672
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:34,220
Rym: It's overtime.

673
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,103
Rym: We're gonna do some bullshitty thing just to end the game or we'll do something quick Or it'll just be a tie.

674
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:42,152
Rym: some sports just allow ties in playoff NHL hockey.

675
00:41:42,272 --> 00:41:45,200
Rym: nope just keep fucking playing normal hockey until someone wins.

676
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,044
Rym: We'll go all day.

677
00:41:46,244 --> 00:41:46,907
Rym: We'll go forever.

678
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:49,900
Rym: the rules literally are go forever.

679
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:59,375
Scott: So I think if you're going to be a new hockey fan Or you're going to try to get someone to be a new hockey fan Playout postseason hockey is I think ideal.

680
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:05,454
Scott: to show people first Yeah, you know it's sort of bad because when they watch a regular season hockey the next year They'd be like

681
00:42:05,475 --> 00:42:08,007
Rym: hey You know what it's like when the anime club

682
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:09,812
Scott: riding the roller coaster first

683
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:17,297
Rym: the anime club showed episode 5 of cowboy bebop But you know the spike just to be like hey check out how fucking awesome anime is.

684
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:17,819
Rym: everyone's like woo.

685
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,578
Rym: And then not all anime is like that.

686
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:33,105
Rym: People see Cagliostro and like who gonna watch way more Lupin, and then they watch like All.

687
00:42:33,145 --> 00:42:34,394
Rym: right, let's bet a moment.

688
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:35,360
Rym: We're reading the tale of Genji.

689
00:42:35,501 --> 00:42:36,466
Rym: I'm continuing to read it.

690
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:38,898
Rym: Genji continues to be the exact same kind of person.

691
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,113
Rym: I feel like there is not growth or change.

692
00:42:42,174 --> 00:42:52,260
Scott: It's the first novel ever and Let's get into our taxi cuz our taxi is yeah, so phenomenal I'd take yeah.

693
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:53,740
Scott: So there's people on the internet.

694
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:08,398
Scott: We're all ranting and raving about this anime called odd taxi all of every episode of which is on crunchyroll And the final episode actually just came out like a week 29th was the last episode of 13 so a couple weeks ago.

695
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:16,920
Scott: So what happened to me is I finally got around to watching it when there were every episode except the final one was out.

696
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:18,548
Scott: I watched it on like there was a.

697
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:20,156
Rym: there was a strong pressure.

698
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:28,020
Rym: No one was telling me Oh, you gotta watch odd taxi, but the people I know who are deep into anime and the anime industry people and Anna Twitter.

699
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,920
Rym: Everyone was talking about this show, but also avoiding talking about it in any amount of detail.

700
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:39,800
Scott: Yep, so I watched all the episodes except for the final one because it wasn't out yet.

701
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,494
Scott: And then I watched the final one the day it came out and that was it.

702
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:43,660
Scott: and now we can do a show on it.

703
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,080
Rym: Yeah, I've seen about a little over half of it, and we're gonna finish it pretty quick because it's so good.

704
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:54,529
Rym: But what that means is I can speculate a little bit without spoiling Just based on what I've seen but the

705
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:55,351
Scott: show

706
00:43:55,371 --> 00:44:17,260
Rym: if I had to just describe it on a really high level it's a psychological thriller where there's a core mystery but a bunch of other stuff is happening like in the orbit of this mystery and There's a lot of very dark and sinister Undertones constantly in a show that on the surface is a bunch of cute animals interacting with this taxi driver.

707
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:29,980
Scott: Yes, so you know in snatch right you have all these different care whole cast of characters all doing different stuff But they're all sort of tied together right by the diamonds right and sort of linking their different stories.

708
00:44:30,463 --> 00:44:35,465
Scott: And there's the scene where they all literally crash into each other At the climax.

709
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:39,098
Scott: so odd taxi is similar, but not so right.

710
00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:39,720
Scott: it's similar.

711
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,253
Scott: And there's a cast of characters who all have their own stories that you all care about.

712
00:44:43,273 --> 00:44:44,056
Scott: individually right.

713
00:44:44,076 --> 00:44:50,100
Scott: all these separate arcs Right but at no point do all the characters crash into each other.

714
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:55,083
Scott: It's that all the characters are linked to Right.

715
00:44:55,525 --> 00:45:02,059
Scott: okamura is his name right a taxi driver Otakawa the taxi driver, it's like you know what it's more like in that regard.

716
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:13,620
Rym: Durara has all these different characters with their crazy deals But they're all tied together by like the mid not like the mythological events that are happening in that neighborhood in ikebukuro.

717
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:18,759
Rym: Yep sure exactly reminds you of that show a lot in terms of that aspect of it.

718
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:31,020
Rym: But instead of being and it's a crazy anime bullshit It's more like there's a paranoid agent weird thing going on that the show is like skirting the edges of something dark and sinister and foreboding.

719
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,940
Scott: Yep, so you have this taxi driver.

720
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:40,409
Scott: He's just a taxi driver And you know he's mostly always just drives like super safe And he's sort of quiet and weird with people.

721
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:45,152
Scott: right you can tell he says like some discomfort like being with people Talking to people normally.

722
00:45:45,172 --> 00:45:47,724
Scott: He'll be like Sarcastic or whatever right?

723
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:54,100
Scott: and there's all these other characters who have their own plot lines that you know sometimes touch each other.

724
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,123
Scott: Sometimes don't.

725
00:45:55,164 --> 00:45:57,030
Scott: some characters don't know each other at all.

726
00:45:57,431 --> 00:45:59,558
Scott: You know some characters are very close to each other.

727
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:00,321
Scott: right there part like.

728
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:07,631
Rym: there's a gorilla who is like a psycho a psycho like a Psychiatrist who also is like the Otakawa.

729
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:09,476
Rym: the taxi driver goes to his clinic.

730
00:46:09,696 --> 00:46:10,779
Rym: There's a nurse that he knows.

731
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:18,480
Rym: there There's this other monkey guy who Not a spoiler easily gets scammed by a very obvious scam that happens in the real world.

732
00:46:18,982 --> 00:46:23,360
Rym: There's two brothers who are cops and one of them seems like he's corrupt and the other one seems like he's stupid.

733
00:46:24,304 --> 00:46:27,899
Scott: Right so right, so there's like Otakawa The Monzai duo I love the most.

734
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:30,428
Scott: Yeah, Monzai duo is great right so it's pretty right.

735
00:46:30,448 --> 00:46:34,260
Scott: so you know Otakawa is connected to the gorilla.

736
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,437
Scott: He's his patient right and the nurse there right, but what does the nurse have to do with the cops?

737
00:46:39,498 --> 00:46:40,120
Scott: like not much?

738
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,612
Scott: But Otakawa is connected to the cops right he like.

739
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:44,556
Scott: he knows them like he'd.

740
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:45,400
Scott: you know he sees them.

741
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,359
Scott: They pull him over sometimes.

742
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,791
Rym: That was something that stood out to me even in the very beginning.

743
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:50,700
Rym: is that it starts out like he's just a taxi driver.

744
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:56,499
Rym: but as the show goes on it seems like these characters have interacted with him before and know a lot about him.

745
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:59,019
Rym: and There's all these moments where he?

746
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,160
Rym: Reveals that he knows a lot more than you would expect him to about some random thing.

747
00:47:06,342 --> 00:47:07,426
Scott: He knows a lot he's.

748
00:47:07,506 --> 00:47:12,120
Scott: all these people are in his taxi spilling the beans and all kinds of stuff thinking He's just a taxi driver.

749
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:24,719
Rym: There's like this whole plot where all these different people keep coming up to him and like they want his Video from the dashcam like right, so that's that's the central mystery at the start of the show right?

750
00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:25,180
Scott: is that?

751
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:32,340
Scott: Supposedly there was some Yakuza boss right a Yakuza boss's daughter who is missing.

752
00:47:33,703 --> 00:47:37,367
Scott: And or you know that no one knows right miss It's like it's the talk of the town.

753
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:39,840
Rym: like that's the news recently that this girl is right.

754
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,021
Rym: It's it.

755
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:56,083
Scott: and the cops were looking for them But then stopped looking and then it did strongly implied but never shown that the the the Yakuza boss daughter took a ride in this taxi and Basically without.

756
00:47:56,144 --> 00:47:59,393
Scott: they don't say anything right, but there's he's.

757
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:03,045
Scott: they imply that a that She was in the taxi.

758
00:48:03,085 --> 00:48:04,592
Scott: you never see that she was in the taxi.

759
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:05,356
Scott: They never show that.

760
00:48:05,376 --> 00:48:07,773
Scott: yeah, right This is dashcam footage.

761
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:20,989
Scott: so people yeah He has video of everything that's happened in the taxi and people are fight trying to get him You know to give them the footage right and he you know stuff happens there That but you don't see.

762
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:22,497
Scott: you never shown the footage right.

763
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:24,365
Scott: you have no idea What would happened.

764
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:28,380
Scott: and also see he's talking to someone in his apartment?

765
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:29,784
Scott: Who's in the closet?

766
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:38,231
Scott: literally the physical closet not metaphorical closet, and they don't talk back to him So you don't know what the fuck is in his closet.

767
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:38,592
Scott: Is it?

768
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:39,516
Scott: is it the girl?

769
00:48:39,596 --> 00:48:39,958
Scott: is it what?

770
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:40,319
Scott: so yeah?

771
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,033
Rym: It's nothing is like he like having see.

772
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:47,353
Rym: like if you watch a little bit of the show There is no one in the closet is a viable theory.

773
00:48:47,373 --> 00:48:48,940
Scott: Yeah, is he just talking to himself?

774
00:48:49,040 --> 00:49:04,451
Scott: It's like you have no ideas, but there's this strong implication that he may have right Kidnapped or not maybe not kidnapped, but maybe she intentionally like you know befriended him And it's like he's hiding her because that's what she wants.

775
00:49:04,471 --> 00:49:19,019
Scott: That's heavily implied But no one knows and that's that's sort of like the this beginning spark mystery that sort of spirals and connects All the other people and their mysteries and their deals.

776
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:32,451
Rym: yeah And throughout the rest of the show at least for the first full half of the show The implications around most of these characters get more and more sinister But they never quite full-on reveal a lot of things.

777
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:39,940
Rym: so the show ends up feeling like a really tight Psychological thriller where the tensions just slowly building episode by episode.

778
00:49:40,523 --> 00:49:43,296
Scott: It's you know those things the story stereotypical thing.

779
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:51,040
Scott: we're like the crazy Detective or person has like a wall with a bunch of photos and streams on nails connecting them and all that stuff, right?

780
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:52,686
Scott: So imagine one of those.

781
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:56,160
Scott: only as you go it actually makes sense.

782
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,000
Scott: It's like whoever made this show whoever wrote this story did that and it actually connects.

783
00:50:01,361 --> 00:50:07,260
Scott: And it's like it was just like a genius piece of writing to make all those things actually work and connect to each other.

784
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,885
Scott: It's like oh, no, it's actually.

785
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:13,380
Scott: it's not just some you know rantings of a you know a madman or whatever.

786
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:17,536
Scott: It's it's actually yeah, you know yeah, we made this thing happen.

787
00:50:17,576 --> 00:50:18,700
Scott: look watch it unfold.

788
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:25,260
Scott: I think what I like most selectively give you and don't give you the audience information at various points in time.

789
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:31,147
Rym: what I like the most is that the dialogue between the characters is Very like it is.

790
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:33,160
Rym: it's hard to describe exactly what I mean by this.

791
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:47,740
Rym: it is very precise and it reveals exactly what the show wants you to know and characters will say things that Imply a lot of other things that will cause you to speculate about the motivations of other characters.

792
00:50:48,063 --> 00:50:50,080
Rym: I'm being vague on purpose because it shows a mystery.

793
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:53,308
Scott: Also, they also people talk to each other.

794
00:50:53,348 --> 00:51:03,899
Scott: the way I think at least according to the subtitles the way people talk to each other Right it's like but like little subtle like the tax driver seems kind of unaware like a taxi driver sometimes But when he's talking to some people.

795
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:07,570
Rym: He'll just say something that makes it very clear.

796
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:10,960
Rym: He knows way more about what's going on than he's letting on.

797
00:51:12,481 --> 00:51:13,706
Rym: But then in other situations.

798
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:17,500
Rym: He is like very clearly surprised by what someone else said to him.

799
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:21,534
Scott: Yeah, so the the different sort of groupings of the plot right is.

800
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:23,160
Scott: there's the gorilla nurse guy.

801
00:51:23,521 --> 00:51:26,359
Scott: Yeah, there's the social media guy hippo.

802
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:35,260
Rym: There's though at the mandrill dobu the the criminal I'm making quote fingers Who's on the loose that the whole town is like after for various?

803
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,082
Scott: Yeah, he's like.

804
00:51:36,122 --> 00:51:41,260
Rym: he's like a little town is Tokyo, but that live streamer guys like I'm gonna get you you criminal.

805
00:51:42,023 --> 00:51:43,629
Scott: Yes, he's an actual gangster.

806
00:51:43,669 --> 00:51:48,220
Scott: that guy yeah like actually doing crimes But he has other motivations.

807
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:53,590
Scott: Then you've got though that's the idol group right.

808
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:55,516
Scott: and then there's the monzai group.

809
00:51:56,198 --> 00:51:56,859
Scott: is that all of them?

810
00:51:58,523 --> 00:51:59,494
Scott: That's most of it right?

811
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:09,179
Rym: yeah I mean the idol group has like the three members we know about plus the manager guy who's clearly up to something and that other Guy in the background is clearly in on it.

812
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:10,003
Scott: So there's these.

813
00:52:10,084 --> 00:52:12,414
Scott: there's these sort of connections between the groups right.

814
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:17,620
Scott: it's like there's a connection between One of them people in the monzai group and one of the idols in the idol group.

815
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:32,420
Scott: there's a connection between the criminal guy and The not the gorilla, but the the nurse who's a alpaca llama But she's not back up, but everyone else all has a red line back to Oda Kawa.

816
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:36,074
Scott: Yeah, every single person's going back to Oda Kawa right?

817
00:52:36,094 --> 00:52:39,727
Scott: they've either been in his taxi Or he's involved with them directly in some way.

818
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:47,691
Scott: right he listens to the monzai group and the monzai guy was in his taxi once right You know there's a. there's a giraffe kid.

819
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,560
Scott: Who's a fan of the monzai group right?

820
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,918
Scott: He's barely in the show, but I know she was in the show more.

821
00:52:53,101 --> 00:52:56,190
Scott: But yeah the show basically just unfolds this mystery.

822
00:52:56,692 --> 00:52:56,992
Scott: right.

823
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:05,244
Scott: and then in the final three episodes Right the second to last and third to last episodes are The odd taxi.

824
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:08,935
Scott: like there's actually a thing the odd taxi that happens right.

825
00:53:08,955 --> 00:53:10,139
Scott: I'm not gonna say any more about that.

826
00:53:11,485 --> 00:53:19,220
Scott: It's the one during Yeah during the course of the odd taxi much is revealed and then in the final episode.

827
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:32,453
Scott: Right the final episode on the one hand is like a great ending and on the other hand could be viewed as Disappointing in the depending on your perspective because what they do in the final episode is it.

828
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:35,580
Scott: it's almost like an epilogue.

829
00:53:36,262 --> 00:53:36,382
Scott: It's.

830
00:53:36,744 --> 00:53:41,720
Scott: it's plays like an epilogue right, but it's actually like.

831
00:53:42,423 --> 00:53:45,300
Scott: You know usually an epilogue is like years after the ending.

832
00:53:45,662 --> 00:53:48,580
Scott: This is like no the ending, but it plays like an epilogue.

833
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,403
Scott: They literally go.

834
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:55,060
Scott: it's like someone went down a checklist of every loose end right and was like all right.

835
00:53:55,101 --> 00:54:04,200
Scott: we'll do this one and And it's like litter every single one in the last episode every loose end every question you had.

836
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:05,927
Scott: They just go one by one.

837
00:54:05,947 --> 00:54:15,980
Scott: they're like and this is what happened to this and this is what the deal was with that And this is what that was about and this explains that and so and so and so all in that one final episode.

838
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:20,272
Scott: So that is in some ways really satisfying because who the fuck does that?

839
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:21,597
Scott: there's usually some hanging shit.

840
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:28,699
Scott: Yeah, right But they left nothing Unknown other than the future of course, but yeah, you know that's always unknown.

841
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:29,884
Rym: well That was a spoiler.

842
00:54:29,924 --> 00:54:32,455
Rym: the world doesn't end as a result of the odd taxi.

843
00:54:32,475 --> 00:54:34,578
Scott: Oh I guess not.

844
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:39,661
Scott: Story about a taxi driver is not an apocalyptic tale the funniest thing We want.

845
00:54:39,681 --> 00:54:47,327
Rym: we watched a couple episodes, and we both had this image of if this were a live-action show like it could work But he's a really great live-action.

846
00:54:47,347 --> 00:54:50,560
Rym: Oh, I imagine Bruce Willis specifically playing Ota Kawa.

847
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:53,579
Scott: Is that just because he drove a taxi in Fifth Element?

848
00:54:53,619 --> 00:55:12,300
Rym: no But it's it's because of like his attitude and like his dialogue and like I just imagine a sort of slaw Slightly slovenly looking like middle-aged Bruce Willis sitting there having those conversations Because Ota Kawa has these moments where he seems really like schlubby, but then he'll just get this hardness about him out of nowhere

849
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,964
Scott: Mmm.

850
00:55:14,045 --> 00:55:18,854
Rym: I'd like that's the kind of thing that Bruce Willis does pretty well And I feel like he would be like that.

851
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:22,880
Rym: that's the kind of actor I would set to play Ota Kawa in the live-action adaptation.

852
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:29,625
Scott: The only thing I could the only other thing I can say about the show is if you're one of the people Unlike me right.

853
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:33,659
Scott: if you're unlike me, and you want you value surprise highly, right?

854
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:41,799
Scott: Because you know I'm not spoiling the show just out of courtesy right because obviously I won't do that But you can spoil it for me, but I already seen it all.

855
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:44,523
Scott: Is that you know?

856
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:47,893
Scott: I think a lot of people avoid spoilers because they want to be surprised.

857
00:55:48,074 --> 00:55:52,051
Scott: the show may surprise you Depending on who you are right.

858
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:57,353
Scott: I don't know about that, but Basically while it was nice to see all those resolutions.

859
00:55:57,513 --> 00:56:04,418
Rym: I was not surprised by anything We've made Emily, and I why as we're watching it have made some specific predictions, and we're very or I.

860
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:13,860
Scott: I don't even know what specific predictions you have made But I will just just knowing the fact that you have made a prediction and that you are an intelligent person who can you know?

861
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,952
Scott: Read subtext, and you know see Chekhov's guns hanging on the wall and things about.

862
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,737
Rym: this show is so full.

863
00:56:21,038 --> 00:56:24,156
Scott: the Chekhov's Chekhov's Arsenal.

864
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:32,220
Scott: yeah Just knowing that you are someone who can recognize that I'll bet 80% chance your predictions are probably just dead on right?

865
00:56:32,361 --> 00:56:32,521
Scott: It's.

866
00:56:33,144 --> 00:56:34,991
Scott: it's that kind of show where it's like yep.

867
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:39,024
Scott: It's it is what you thought it was But it doesn't.

868
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:40,550
Scott: it doesn't take away from it right?

869
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:44,364
Scott: it doesn't need surprise because what you thought it was Was was great.

870
00:56:44,785 --> 00:56:47,773
Rym: what I like about it is doesn't need to be surprised just the character.

871
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:57,627
Rym: the tension in almost every Conversation any character has is palpable and that is what drives this show forward More so than the mystery itself.

872
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:08,280
Rym: and the one thing I get the other thing I can say is in terms of we always talk About the great anime or the one where you end an episode and you are compelled Without even thinking your body just moves on to the next episode.

873
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:12,099
Rym: It was real hard to stop watching this show last night to go to bed.

874
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,909
Rym: Mmm like even the great pretender as much as I liked it.

875
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,154
Rym: I could be like okay.

876
00:57:17,174 --> 00:57:18,820
Rym: That was enough anime for tonight.

877
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:26,352
Rym: But this show was one of those rare shows where if I was in college if we were in college And I'd watch one episode of this.

878
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:26,554
Rym: well.

879
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:32,224
Rym: It's also so short It's only what twelve thirteen thirteen episodes, but if I'd seen one episode of this in college I would have finished it that night.

880
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,112
Scott: No matter what it's not long.

881
00:57:34,173 --> 00:57:35,217
Scott: You can finish it in six.

882
00:57:35,237 --> 00:57:41,113
Rym: You know six hours I mean we used to like we used to watch In one go basically right.

883
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:43,405
Scott: yeah, it's the last thing I want to say about the show.

884
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:53,260
Scott: the thing I like about the show the most right is Not even this very well-crafted You know mystery plot with all these characters and all this right, which is all awesome.

885
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:56,498
Scott: Yeah, it's just simply just the atmosphere of the show.

886
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:58,627
Scott: yeah It's like if you're.

887

888
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,472
Scott: You know we have but I don't know if other people listening.

889
00:58:03,532 --> 00:58:04,960
Scott: the listener has right of like.

890
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:12,624
Scott: You're in a hotel in some city, and you wake up early and you go out And it's still dark.

891
00:58:12,986 --> 00:58:15,458
Scott: right and it's quiet and the streets empty.

892
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:18,866
Scott: mostly There's some people around.

893
00:58:18,946 --> 00:58:24,911
Scott: right the con the desk person at the hotel is there right the one guy with the taxi Who's gonna drive it to the airport.

894
00:58:24,951 --> 00:58:26,120
Scott: is they get to the airport?

895
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:35,585
Rym: It's empty But there's the one person there the airport desk to take your man And a lot of the characters are the kinds of people who are up and about during that Liminal hour.

896
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:41,012
Scott: you go you go to the bodega That's open at 1 a.m.. To get something.

897
00:58:41,414 --> 00:58:45,740
Rym: only the bodega guys there on the street And it's the same bodega guy at 1 a.m.. Every day.

898
00:58:45,841 --> 00:58:59,920
Rym: So if you go in at night at that early hour every day Then like it's you to see each other every day that of each other's that real-life Atmosphere of being in a city place that would normally be crowded and busy, but it's dark quiet and empty.

899
00:59:00,363 --> 00:59:02,320
Scott: But you're not completely alone.

900
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:06,147
Scott: There's someone else there But they're not a person you're close to.

901
00:59:06,227 --> 00:59:19,956
Scott: there's some sort of stranger that you're with right at an at a weird hour Possibly a stranger you recognize But don't know and that part is and it's and it's a stranger that you're going to interact with right in some way even if It's just capitalism right?

902
00:59:20,279 --> 00:59:27,110
Rym: well Just like the kinds of conversations on how it has with his passengers like you might as well Just taking that out of someone else's - calf right.

903
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:34,493
Scott: so that atmosphere that feeling The show doesn't always have that atmosphere at all times right.

904
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:38,439
Scott: there's parts of the show where it's crowded daytime Right oh the things going on.

905
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:48,817
Scott: but a lot of the show especially earlier in the show is just that atmosphere almost all the time because it's about a guy who Drives his taxi, and oh did we mention he doesn't really sleep right.

906
00:59:48,837 --> 00:59:51,098
Scott: so yeah He's out and he's driving it.

907
00:59:51,138 --> 00:59:51,862
Rym: no You know what else?

908
00:59:51,903 --> 00:59:52,465
Rym: it reminds you.

909
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:57,124
Rym: because of his insomnia and because of the not enough again I haven't seen the whole show.

910
00:59:57,546 --> 01:00:03,956
Rym: it is implied that he is mentally unstable And it's also implied by the way seeing a gorilla.

911
01:00:04,036 --> 01:00:05,602
Scott: He's seeing a gorilla You know doc.

912
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:11,859
Rym: yeah, right, but it's implied that the other people around him also pick up on that in the show.

913
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:14,709
Rym: and There's a I don't you ever saw.

914
01:00:14,729 --> 01:00:18,323
Rym: there's a movie the machinists Very similar.

915
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:19,427
Scott: There's a movie called that.

916
01:00:19,587 --> 01:00:20,330
Rym: it's you probably like it.

917
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,754
Rym: It's a psychological thriller.

918
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:22,537
Rym: It's not.

919
01:00:22,657 --> 01:00:23,480
Rym: it's not like this.

920
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:24,603
Rym: There's only one.

921
01:00:24,623 --> 01:00:27,593
Rym: There's a mystery and a thread, but it doesn't.

922
01:00:27,673 --> 01:00:29,720
Rym: it's a very similar atmosphere at times.

923
01:00:30,822 --> 01:00:41,596
Scott: The point is there's something about that atmosphere that I I know for some reason I like it even in real life shared a little spaces like pre-dawn late like that.

924
01:00:41,616 --> 01:00:41,937
Rym: that.

925
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,160
Scott: yeah, right.

926
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:51,024
Scott: So if I experience that in a usually you're experiencing that in a movie or television show right you're not really Experiencing that so much in a book.

927
01:00:51,345 --> 01:01:05,240
Scott: that often right I think you know while you could put it in a book the book doesn't Make you feel the same way because it doesn't have the you know The show portrays and like makes you feel that very very directly and very realistically.

928
01:01:05,782 --> 01:01:09,157
Scott: I felt the exact same feels right that I felt like.

929
01:01:09,278 --> 01:01:09,499
Scott: you know.

930
01:01:10,322 --> 01:01:17,973
Scott: I felt like I was waiting outside in the dark alone trying to get a taxi or Walking on a Manhattan Street to get to the subway alone at night.

931
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:19,960
Scott: Yeah, all the stores are closed except for one.

932
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:20,964
Scott: You know this.

933
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:24,638
Scott: I felt exactly like that when I was watching the show and I like that personally.

934
01:01:24,759 --> 01:01:32,268
Rym: so And yeah, I don't really want to say anything else cuz I'm gonna watch the rest of it like Just wait till it's night and just go walk around.

935
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,195
Scott: Hey, that's kind of why I like.

936
01:01:34,215 --> 01:01:35,559
Scott: the problem is it's really crap.

937
01:01:37,582 --> 01:01:40,900
Rym: Like to get the full night biking experience, I know we want night biking that other time.

Scott: or is it originally?

943
01:01:58,496 --> 01:01:59,240

944
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:03,645
Scott: Okay, I didn't know those among Let's see.

945

Rym: Let's see the series aired.

01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:22,119
Rym: I'm looking to see what the deal is with the manga cuz I always the show the show and oh, no The manga is an adaptation of the anime.

953
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,083
Scott: Okay, we don't need that.

954
01:02:24,123 --> 01:02:29,419
Rym: Yep that I see no reason to read a my adaptation of this considering how good this is.

955
01:02:30,223 --> 01:02:31,895
Scott: Yeah, that's it's you're good.

956
01:02:32,217 --> 01:02:32,580

957
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:35,409
Scott: But if you have I always say this you're gonna.

958
01:02:35,429 --> 01:02:38,260
Scott: if you're gonna live your life and you're gonna you think you're gonna survive.

959
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:40,670
Scott: You know, you got six hours of time in your life.

960
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,220
Scott: that you're you know, you're not gonna like pass away soon.

961
01:02:43,361 --> 01:02:46,320
Scott: Right, you can spend the six hours to watch odd taxi and you could do much worse.

962
01:02:46,481 --> 01:02:55,215
Rym: I would actually say this is one of those shows where if you if you like anime at all Just watch the show don't like why you just go watch even if you don't like any.

963
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:56,620
Rym: I was gonna get to the second part.

964
01:02:57,163 --> 01:03:02,066
Rym: I'm gonna tell my mom to watch this cuz she would Can watch the odd taxi.

965
01:03:02,086 --> 01:03:04,595
Rym: Yeah, both our moms would like this show a lot.

966
01:03:04,936 --> 01:03:07,848
Scott: Yeah, I think everyone I can't think of many people who wouldn't like the.

967
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:18,700
Rym: I need adult humans that wouldn't like the odds Like the straw man who is like, oh animation is for children and I hate it If you actually get him to watch even a few minutes of the first episode.

968
01:03:19,283 --> 01:03:22,479
Rym: It's hard to imagine a person who is not intrigued by what is going on.

969
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,740
Scott: The only person I could see being turned off by this is one of those.

970
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:31,649
Scott: You know people who can't see past the surface level and it's like like oh this animal people Can't deal with that people.

971
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:33,440
Scott: Yeah, someone who's like that.

972
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:37,754
Scott: It was so, you know closed-minded in that way or I can't see past that.

973
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:42,030
Scott: That's the only person I can imagine Or like a child right wouldn't?

974
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,920
Scott: I think younger people probably wouldn't enjoy this.

975
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:50,579
Scott: They might think it's a little boring and it's a lot of social commentary stuff going on Especially with the social media guy and the game playing guy.

976
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:53,567
Rym: Oh my god the game playing guy.

977
01:03:53,607 --> 01:03:57,420
Rym: that the episode where you get that guy's backstory was so well written.

978
01:03:58,254 --> 01:03:59,462
Scott: Oh, yeah What he's when he's?

979
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:00,084
Rym: what do you were like?

980
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:05,839
Rym: his mental dialogue like he is narrating his own life and the way he like.

981
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:09,331
Rym: He actually accepts responsibility for the shitty things.

982
01:04:09,351 --> 01:04:11,840
Rym: He's about to do was it was just an interesting notes?

983
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:15,407
Scott: Yeah, that guy's a that's a really great character.

984
01:04:15,488 --> 01:04:17,332
Scott: That is a really great under.

985
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:31,100
Rym: I think that's like an under appreciated part of the show that guy now that is spent especially when there's a moment when there is CCTV footage of that guy doing a thing and someone else sees that and thinks it's a different person.

986
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:36,878
Scott: Yep But yeah, watch the odd taxi and I'm gonna go get food.
