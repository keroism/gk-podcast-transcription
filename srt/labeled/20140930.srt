1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,978
Rym: It's Tuesday September 30th 2014.

00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,802
Rym: I'm Rym.

Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

Rym: flouche It's and Dante.

5
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:25,013
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:32,174
Rym: I Don't think you guys understand how excited we are about the term flouche.

7
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:37,595
Scott: Yes, only a panda would know There are listeners are not pandas yet.

8
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:44,458
Rym: Yep So, yeah, we played pan Dante and it was pretty much the best it was.

9
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:49,434
Scott: so flouche Let's wait until the main bit to actually talk about the main bit one of the main bit to talk about the flouche.

10
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:50,196
Scott: Yes.

11
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:52,483
Rym: Yeah All right.

12
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:56,500
Rym: So, uh in the news, you know, you're jumping straight to news there.

13
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:57,463
Rym: What do you got?

14
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:58,929
Rym: some other bid you want to talk about?

15
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:00,575
Rym: No, no nothing at all.

16
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:00,957
Rym: No.

17
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:01,719
Rym: All right.

18
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:05,693
Rym: Oh, though our live stream has already gone to bad status.

19
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:06,616
Scott: That's not my fault.

20
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:07,540
Scott: You suck at technology.

21
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:10,069
Rym: Actually, it looks like the Elgato software is fucking something up.

22
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:13,180
Scott: I've been using x-split which it costs money, but whatever.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,352
Rym: Yeah, I like the Elgato hardware But the software is just bought and it just doesn't work that way.

24
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:20,480
Scott: only thing the Elgato software does that is good.

25
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:23,032
Scott: That other software does not do is auto ducking.

26
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:24,780
Scott: Nothing else does the auto ducking.

27
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,619
Rym: Yeah, I can do the auto ducking here with the onyx and everything.

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,280
Scott: Well, yeah and your heart but most people do not have some sort of auto ducking hardware.

29
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:36,000
Scott: Yeah, the Elgato doing it is you know, the Elgato software doing it is great.

30
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:40,376
Scott: Normally for other stuff you need like OBS there was like a weird shady plug-in that caused money.

31
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:44,193
Rym: though the Elgato You know, I guess it's relevant talking about game streaming.

32
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:52,500
Rym: the trouble with the Elgato hardware too Is that it'll usually between it and its software have a semi non-deterministic or broken delay?

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,270
Rym: Between your voice in the game.

34
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:55,740
Scott: You have to push the buttons in the right order.

35
00:01:57,982 --> 00:01:58,906
Scott: They might have fixed that bug.

36
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:02,320
Rym: I don't think they did because I was testing and I still saw a lot of weird issues.

37
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:04,599
Scott: Anyway, let's now talk about news.

38
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:09,753
Scott: The biggest news in gaming yup on October 3rd, and right now we're recording this.

39
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,419
Scott: my calendar says September 30th.

40
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,529
Scott: for you It's probably October 1st.

41
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:24,315
Scott: They're going to release for the 3ds Super Smash Bros The most important game in all of video gaming a new release.

42
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:30,474
Scott: Hopefully not garbage For the first time ever on a portable system.

43
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:31,477
Scott: Not bad.

44
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,789
Scott: Oh my god This shit is going Mario.

45
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:40,987
Scott: It's weird because this basically destroys the competition Completely, but what is the competition Mario Kart?

46
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,831
Scott: It's like they're killing them.

47
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:52,160
Scott: every other multiplayer game that they make is now worthless Because the only game anyone is gonna play when there is more than one person with a 3ds is Smash Bros.

48
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,806
Rym: What about what about the new Tetris?

49
00:02:54,849 --> 00:03:02,960
Scott: I mean, I'll play that but I mean it's gonna be if there's a free demo of Smash Bros In the in the e-shop so you can go play that now It's pretty much Smash Bros.

50
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:06,091
Scott: The only problem I have with it is that the controls.

51
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:11,990
Scott: they're trying to mimic the GameCube controls and in the demo You can't go to the settings and change them because just a demo.

52
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,280
Scott: so jump is why and right because they're Mike.

53
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,375
Scott: They're mimicking the GameCube which but on a 3ds that's backwards.

54
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,543
Scott: I don't want to jump with the button That's at the top.

55
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:25,238
Scott: I want to attack at that button and jump with B and then right.

56
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,279
Scott: so That's annoying at least our and I'll do the right thing.

57
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:35,555
Scott: Yeah, so we'll have to see what we do there because the game It's gonna take over the world pretty much in terms of handheld gaming.

58
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:47,014
Scott: and then when the Wii U one comes out I think only like serious people who are like either people have we use are gonna get it obviously But people are serious about competing if it proves competitively viable.

59
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:56,032
Scott: unlike the previous Smash Brothers they will get the Wii U one for their tournaments and such but The 3ds one I think is really gonna be the one that takes the cake.

60
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:58,823
Rym: well because the Wii U is up and also ran At this point.

61
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:04,586
Scott: in other news on the iPad you can now get the free-to-play Pokemon trading card game.

62
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:06,613
Scott: it was available on a way.

63
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:11,533
Scott: It still is available on a web version But now on the iPad a Nintendo game.

64
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:14,650
Rym: Oh Shit, so we'll see.

65
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,260
Rym: I mean we're not gonna review it from the demo.

66
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,707
Rym: We're gonna wait for the real game to come out.

67
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:18,911
Scott: I purred on Amazon.

68
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:20,540
Rym: Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to arrive and then we'll play.

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
Rym: I Think at least all my original concerns.

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,240
Rym: I was worried because of what they did to Mario Tennis that they were gonna do the same thing to smash.

71
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:33,730
Rym: But I think they at least Mario Tennis like they're making.

72
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:48,978
Scott: it does seem like they're putting in some effort to appeal to the competitive Gaming scene, but the problem is is I'm not good enough at smash to be able to tell on my own Whether this smash is competitively viable because my fingers are not fast, and I don't know how to wave - or anything like that.

73
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,000
Scott: so We need to consult an expert on these matters.

74
00:04:53,662 --> 00:05:04,248
Rym: Yeah, well the other trouble is just that you know they ruined Mario - Mario Tennis is no longer a skill game It's just Simon says which Mario Tennis the newest Mario Tennis on the 3ds.

75
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,899
Rym: That's true and Mario Kart was pretty good.

76
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,855
Rym: So I feel like there's a lot of inconsistency.

77
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:18,902
Rym: like they they've decided They see certain games as being competitive, and I feel like if you're not one of those games fuck you Mmm.

78
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:28,050
Rym: They're going cuz you know that old thing about how Team Fortress 2 was way more popular among the players When they made it more random without telling them what they did.

79
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:40,040
Rym: so I wonder if Nintendo is going down the road of making games fun quote-unquote fun for players on average Irrespective of other concerns like tests of skill.

80
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:48,020
Scott: That's sort of the perfect storm of that because in terms of fun It's like default mode is items on but they let you turn items off.

81
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,630
Rym: That's it the fact that they let you turn the items off?

82
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,843
Rym: all their games have not let you do that as much so by Default?

83
00:05:53,883 --> 00:06:03,160
Scott: it's crazy fun for everyone, but the hardcore people It's crazy fun for everyone, but the hardcore people can then make it hardcore, so it's fun for them as well.

84
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:08,780
Scott: So it's like imagine if an FPS didn't have invert y-axis.

85
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:13,443
Scott: Well everyone could play except Rym and Scott Johnson Mmm.

86
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:24,920
Scott: My muscle memories to the point to where there's no backing away from that, but then I imagine if a Spaceship free space shooting game like x-wing released today did not have invert y-axis.

87
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,699
Rym: What if a game like that just didn't support joysticks?

88
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,964
Scott: And wouldn't exist?

89
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:31,391
Rym: yeah, well joysticks.

90
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,240
Rym: Don't exist, but that says a whole separate show.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,501
Rym: We should.

92
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:36,417
Scott: I would buy a copy to set on fire, but that would mean I have to buy a cop.

93
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:36,659
Scott: yeah.

94
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:43,246
Rym: So uh in other news five nights at Freddy's I'm amazed so my I'm surprised.

95
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:48,820
Scott: so my co-workers started talking about wait wait independently of me this I didn't even know it existed.

96
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:55,300
Scott: They started talking about it in relation to something and then a couple days later Rym talked about it.

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,324
Scott: And I'm like whoa.

98
00:06:56,445 --> 00:07:06,913
Rym: this is why I'm amazed because at the same time like when I was talking to you about it you did not know much about it and I only knew from that conversation with my co-workers and the steam store page.

99
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:17,210
Rym: my co-workers never heard of it But I ran afoul of it in internet circles from day one Mm-hmm like I knew about this game when it was.

100
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,800
Scott: pretty much you knew about it early on when it was way early.

101
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:25,890
Rym: Okay, so and I'm not gonna get into the story of how it was made or anything We'll do a full show on it at some point if she's got a kickstarter or something.

102
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:32,320
Rym: so the game itself is Is Legitimately terrifying.

103
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:34,786
Scott: Not in not a baby.

104
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:37,697
Rym: No no not in the sense of like Yamashibai like.

105
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,303
Rym: oh my god It's scary.

106
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:41,772
Scott: I'm scared by anything since I was like two.

107
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,819
Rym: so can a jump scare get you?

108
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:45,444
Scott: It's not scary.

109
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:46,608
Scott: That's a surprise.

110
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:47,109
Scott: Yeah, Scott.

111
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,072
Rym: Yeah, there's the thing there's.

112
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:50,640
Rym: there's a gradient between surprise and scared.

113
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:52,969
Rym: I did not say the game scared me.

114
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,495
Rym: I said it terrified me.

115
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:54,856
Rym: Okay.

116
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,860
Rym: Here's what happened.

117
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,960
Scott: I think terrified is just extreme for is the same thing is scared only to a greater degree?

118
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,285
Rym: No, I would say that terrified is extreme fearful surprise Yeah, you.

119
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,087
Rym: so here's the thing.

120
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:11,080
Rym: the game does not pretend that it's not getting you with jump scares.

121
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,011
Rym: In fact in the very beginning when you started it says warning.

122
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,198
Rym: This game is basically just jump scares.

123
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:25,140
Rym: great so, you know who you know and It uses jump scares Effectively to punish you for failing.

124
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:30,385
Rym: so as a result you're playing the game and Then my experience.

125
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:32,837
Rym: I start playing the game and I kind of know what the deal is and I play.

126
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,062
Rym: through night one It was pretty good.

127
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:40,865
Rym: But in night two when shit got real and the game was even like yo dog shits real now It tells you shit's about to go.

128
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:45,197
Rym: basically my heart rate was going up because the game is just extremely playing.

129
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:47,365
Scott: at a biometric sensor I could feel it.

130
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,920
Rym: My heart was pounding because the game is very stressful to play.

131
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:54,974
Rym: You have to be paying attention to all these things constantly.

132
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,380
Scott: You haven't even told people what the game is.

133
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,207
Rym: yeah, so because I'm saying this is why the game got me.

134
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:09,500
Rym: and then the moment happened where the game you're like I lost and The jump scare thing was about to happen and I knew a jump scare was coming.

135
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:16,400
Rym: So what I did is I leaned back from my monitor Folded my arms and I kind of looked away just like waiting for it to happen.

136
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,920
Rym: Like you do if you run you look at one of those like jump scare kind of memes.

137
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:24,920
Rym: So I'm just waiting for it to happen and then I'm gonna restart the game and it just doesn't happen.

138
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:34,446
Rym: it doesn't happen and it doesn't happen and I Literally Lee like I lean in a little bit and then it happens and I take the mouse and I move it to see if like The game crashed.

139
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:35,312
Scott: and then it happened.

140
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:36,400
Scott: Have you moved the mouse?

141
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,489
Scott: He wasn't gonna do it if you weren't there, but then I thought back.

142
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:43,800
Rym: the game warned me that moving the mouse would do it.

143
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:44,503
Scott: Oh did it?

144
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:45,509
Rym: so so here's the deal.

145
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,360
Rym: The game is very simple.

146
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:53,317
Rym: You are working minimum wage the night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant.

147
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:54,641
Scott: in other words, Chuck E. Cheese Chuck E.

148
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,209
Rym: Cheese's Freddy Fazbear and there's some other.

149
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,580
Scott: there's four animatronic suits in other words the rock of fire explosion.

150
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:04,171
Rym: So your job is to sit there for midnight until 6 a.m.

151
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,117
Rym: And be the night watchman.

152
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:06,940
Scott: you can't okay.

153
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,910
Scott: So Chuck E. Cheese's don't have night watchman first of all.

154
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,166
Rym: Yeah, so this automated security systems if anything Yeah, so this one has.

155
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:17,040
Scott: they also I don't think have rock of fire explosions at Chuck E. Cheese.

156
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,068
Scott: They just have arcade games and cranes and shit.

157
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,340
Rym: So you're really gonna try to make this a realistic game here.

158
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,847
Rym: You're gonna really pick it apart on that level.

159
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:24,129
Rym: Yes.

160
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:25,134
Rym: So here's what.

161
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:25,556
Rym: here's the deal.

162
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:26,420
Rym: You're sitting there in the room.

163
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,544
Rym: You cannot leave the room.

164
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:31,919
Rym: The only controls you have is you can move the mouse to look left or right.

165
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,714
Rym: There's open doors to the left and to the right.

166
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:35,599
Scott: Why are there two doors?

167
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,464
Scott: That's just like the security.

168
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,170
Scott: main security room is a weird-ass building.

169
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:39,873
Scott: who made this thing?

170
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,720
Rym: the labs actually really straightforward.

171
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:42,577
Rym: You're sitting in a room.

172
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:47,236
Rym: There's two hallways that go out from either side of you into like different areas of the complex.

173
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:48,240
Scott: Chuck E. Cheese has hallways.

174
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,980
Scott: It's a big open building with like a kitchen for the pizza.

175
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:56,580
Rym: Yeah Like the back hallways like where they store the animatronic suits that they're working on and like the arcade games.

176
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,002
Rym: They need issues.

177
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,268
Scott: They don't have those things.

178
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:01,000
Scott: They send them away in a truck and the kitchen and all that stuff.

179
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,345
Rym: Plus you're talking about Chuck E. Cheese's.

180
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:03,470
Rym: This is Freddy Fazbear's.

181
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:05,016
Scott: Okay, totally different place.

182
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:05,940
Scott: This is a fancy place.

183
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:18,893
Rym: Well, it's coming down on rough times Because if you're playing the game you'll do like you see a newspaper like pinned up to the wall and if you read it Like a kid got bit by one of the animatronics or something like that.

184
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,197
Scott: They're on a stage.

185
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:21,000
Scott: No one goes near them.

186
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:23,330
Rym: Yeah, apparently kid went and fucked with one of them.

187
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,535
Scott: Well, then he gets what he deserves.

188
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:25,700
Scott: They get electrocuted by that shit.

189
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,221
Rym: Yeah, apparently he made it a surprising amount of time without his frontal lobe after the bite of 87 Great.

190
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:36,440
Rym: So the game the conceit of the game for getting your bullshit is that you sit in this room?

191
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,183
Rym: You can't leave.

192
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:39,733
Rym: The only controls you have are look right look left.

193
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:41,079
Scott: Why can't you leave you tied down?

194
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,464
Rym: Oh, yeah, like there's no way out.

195
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:43,147
Rym: You're stuck in the room.

196
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,172
Rym: Who knows?

197
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:44,393
Rym: Why?

198
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,201
Scott: Okay, so you did so.

199
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:47,790
Rym: it's one of those disempowering things.

200
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,883
Rym: you can move the mouse down and that

201
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,011
Scott: look at your junk pulls

202
00:11:52,252 --> 00:12:02,500
Rym: up a view a display in front of your face like physically like it pulls up in front of you and then you can see all the Security cameras and you click on the map on all the cameras and you see what that camera sees.

203
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,646
Rym: You can't control the camera.

204
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:07,880
Rym: camera like moves back and forth does its own thing in that room But you can look at that camera.

205
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:09,387
Rym: You can look at anything cameras.

206
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,360
Rym: if you move the mouse back up the console goes back down.

207
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,235
Rym: You're looking at the room again.

208
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:20,737
Rym: You can shut the door to the left or right and you can turn on the light in the hallway right there to the left or to the right.

209
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:28,120
Rym: as Long as you are using the camera have a light on or have a door closed your power consumption increases.

210
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:30,507
Rym: Okay, this place has limited power.

211
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:33,720
Rym: They're trying to save budget and the doors are open by default.

212
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,267
Rym: It takes power to hold them closed.

213
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,994
Scott: What is what kind of shitty door?

214
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,240
Scott: Just the wooden doors, right?

215
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,967
Rym: No, they're steel security doors.

216
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,338
Scott: What the fuck are the Steel's electronic?

217
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:48,678
Rym: Yeah So Scott if you play this game the the vibe is that what kind of fucked up join is this?

218
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,680
Scott: Yeah What kind of?

219
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:54,660
Rym: So you're in this room with steel security doors and they default open.

220
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,199
Rym: So if the power runs out all the lights go out and the doors open.

221
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,220
Scott: Doors default to closed.

222
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:04,013
Rym: No, so imagine imagine a safety like a fire code thing where.

223
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:05,879
Scott: imagine a grocery store with power doors.

224
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:07,879
Scott: They closed if the power stop.

225
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:15,720
Rym: So imagine a grocery store where the doors if they're closed and the power goes out They default to closed and you can't get out because there's still security doors.

226
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,744
Rym: Everyone strapped inside.

227
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:20,477
Scott: you just move them with their hands because they have manual controls because their doors.

228
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:21,340
Scott: you can open them with their hands.

229
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,337
Rym: Yeah, this place has a steel security doors that nothing can break.

230
00:13:25,357 --> 00:13:25,980
Rym: through these things.

231
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:27,628
Scott: You can pull them open with their hands.

232
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:28,492
Scott: No, they're way.

233
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:29,256
Scott: they weigh like a ton.

234
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,000
Scott: They're they have a knob.

235
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:30,823
Rym: No, there's.

236
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:30,984
Rym: no.

237
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:35,040
Rym: now these are the kinds of doors like on the outside of a blast furnace.

238
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,660
Rym: They're like the doors you would put on the outside of a light saber to cut through.

239
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:41,359
Scott: Yeah, nuclear bunker door and a chuggy cheese.

240
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:42,417
Rym: Yeah.

241
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:52,834
Rym: So you're sitting there and you get a phone call like a voicemail from the guy who did your job like the previous week Like hey, dude, here's how to do the job.

242
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:54,099
Rym: Keep an eye on him.

243
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,143
Scott: So he still lived.

244
00:13:55,745 --> 00:14:00,180
Rym: and what he warns you is that these animatronic suits they're AI controlled.

245
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:06,128
Rym: so during the day like they do their thing on their own they're programmed and At night, they like to roam around.

246
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,360
Rym: because if you don't let him move around at night their servers lock up or whatever.

247
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,185
Rym: he doesn't know or care.

248
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:10,930
Rym: that's just how it is.

249
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:19,384
Rym: and Part of the AI is that if they see an exoskeleton that's not inside of the animatronic suit That's against the rules.

250
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:20,829
Rym: So they will put it in a suit.

251
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:23,580
Rym: They'll go they'll take it and they'll shove it into a suit.

252
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:26,980
Rym: Okay They see a human being after hours.

253
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:35,837
Rym: They think it's an exoskeleton they shove it into a suit and because that suits full of a bunch of metal and electronics That's pretty much guaranteed to horribly kill you.

254
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:48,400
Scott: Okay, so if they see how strong are they I could I mean if I lay are huge and powerful But if I'm standing there if I meet the real rock of fire explosion, I can just kick one of those fuckers over and smash.

255
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:49,584
Scott: It's not that durable.

256
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:54,139
Rym: Uh, yeah, these things can overpower a human being so they're basically the Terminator.

257
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,248
Scott: Yes So if why is the Terminator?

258
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,433
Scott: we're getting a Chuck E. Cheese.

259
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:01,491
Rym: Yeah, so, you know on the fourth night You should be going to save John kind on the third or fourth night.

260
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:09,882
Rym: The guy's voicemail is basically like yes So and the guy's like I think this place kind of fucked up Vietnam.

261
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:14,200
Rym: I feel like you should go check on like what's in those other suits in the supply room.

262
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,291
Scott: And the third night after the first night, why don't you quit?

263
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:18,595
Rym: cuz you need this money.

264
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:23,700
Rym: I can get money elsewhere Maybe not because your name is Mike Schmidt and you probably need money the best.

265
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:25,267
Scott: You know what?

266
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:25,488
Scott: I'll do.

267
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,400
Scott: I'll just rob this fucking place and leave if you win the game.

268
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,724
Scott: Possible, you know what it gives you.

269
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:35,600
Rym: It just shows you you made a hundred and twenty dollars by surviving this bullshit.

270
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,103
Scott: Oh, you beat it.

271
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:37,007
Rym: Yeah.

272
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,992
Rym: Well, I didn't beat it.

273
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,500
Rym: I I went looked up a spoiler.

274
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:40,989
Rym: so the way.

275
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:45,090
Rym: so you're sitting there in the game and You get these warnings and then you look at the stage.

276
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,820
Rym: there's three animatronic suits and you look at pirate Cove.

277
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:48,864
Rym: There's a fourth suit.

278
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:51,937
Rym: You can't see this behind a curtain and that's the whole game.

279
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:52,540
Rym: They roam around.

280
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:55,770
Rym: They you got to keep an eye on them.

281
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,611
Rym: They all follow different rules and Shit's kind of terrifying.

282
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:00,740
Rym: I don't want to spoil stuff.

283
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,748
Rym: I feel like you guys should play it.

284
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,039
Rym: cuz it's such a short game.

285
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,329
Rym: I'll give you two example of some shit that went down.

286
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,076
Rym: So I look at the stage.

287
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:07,960
Rym: all three suits are there.

288
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,143
Scott: Tell you about my character.

289
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:10,929
Rym: and then I look at pirate Cove.

290
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,740
Rym: the the curtains closed and then I see some sort of hallucination.

291
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,984
Rym: That happens occasionally.

292
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:22,120
Rym: and then I look at the pirate Cove and I look at the stage again and Bonnie the bunnies gone.

293
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:23,735
Scott: I just go chill out in the pirate Cove.

294
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,239
Rym: You can't move.

295
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,959
Rym: I'll see if you go there it'll see you and it'll kill you.

296
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:30,200
Rym: So I look at the stage and Bonnie's gone body the bunnies gone.

297
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,725
Rym: So I started looking around.

298
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:35,759
Rym: I find her on the camera and she's like in the hallway kind of near me.

299
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:45,492
Rym: So it turns out that the cameras actually have a blind spot as the guy warns you on the phone Right next to your doors.

300
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,750
Rym: So Eventually, I can't find Bonnie the bunny like.

301
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,473
Rym: look at all the cameras.

302
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:50,698
Rym: I just can't fucking find her.

303
00:16:51,643 --> 00:17:00,314
Rym: then I just pull out of that pull out of the camera and I click on the light and she is right fucking outside the door looking inside and I slammed the door shut.

304
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:00,896
Rym: Mm-hmm.

305
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:01,739
Rym: She doesn't kill me.

306
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:09,058
Rym: Then I pull the camera up to look for Chica the chicken cuz he like is wandering around somewhere.

307
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:11,255
Rym: I couldn't find him I don't see him.

308
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:22,611
Rym: and then suddenly the fun that the chicken pulls the camera down and kills me out of Nowhere and it scared the ever-living fuck out of me.

309
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:24,680
Scott: Okay, so why do you use the cameras at all?

310
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,693
Scott: Why don't you just only use the lights and close the doors when necessary?

311
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:29,300
Rym: Ah, so here here's the spoiler.

312
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:44,751
Rym: So the the suit that's hanging out in Pirate Cove who Foxy the pirate is pretty cool guy he if you don't look at him enough or if you look at him too much because you're paranoid.

313
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:53,804
Rym: he slowly activates and Eventually, like if you look in the room and he's not there anymore like he'll open the curtain He's kind of looking at you.

314
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,900
Rym: then he's like hanging out in front of the curtain like in front of the auto-order side.

315
00:17:58,845 --> 00:17:59,811
Rym: One time I looked in there.

316
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:01,220
Rym: he's gone just gone.

317
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,943
Rym: I'm like, oh fuck.

318
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:09,259
Rym: and then I look at the hallway and he's literally sprinting down the hallway toward my door Mm-hmm, and he'll just come and kill you.

319
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:26,608
Rym: Okay, the game punishes players If they fail with jump scares and the jump scares are artfully designed Such that even if you were an intelligent human being who thinks I won't be gotten by the jump scare It'll jump scare you anyway.

320
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,756
Scott: the game anyone can beat jumps.

321
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:35,937
Rym: the game is Clever in ways that I don't want to reveal because I feel like you should explore and experience these things yourself.

322
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,818
Rym: it Legitimately raised my heart rate.

323
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:51,678
Rym: it gave me an adrenaline rush like a for-real one the same feeling you get when a car almost hit you while you're biking and it's just generally extremely stressful and frustrating to play in a really fun way.

324
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:56,494
Rym: I Highly recommend you try five nights at Freddy's.

325
00:18:56,856 --> 00:19:01,109
Rym: Yeah Yeah, Scott hates games like this interrupted me trying to explain it.

326
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:03,957
Rym: But obviously guys this game is great and you should play it.

327
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,253
Rym: I Don't know why you're so a on it.

328
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:09,834
Rym: I mean, why would you be at the game use it?

329
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:13,730
Rym: It's it does horror and How is it not horror?

330
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,951
Rym: What?

331
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:15,079
Rym: how could you make a horror game then?

332
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,283
Scott: An intelligent person can't be scared Uh-huh.

333
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,290
Rym: So there's no such thing as horror ever.

334
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:22,314
Rym: There's no horror fiction.

335
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:23,238
Rym: There's no horror movies.

336
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:23,800
Scott: Not for me.

337
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,673
Rym: So there's no such thing as a genre of horror.

338
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:30,110
Scott: back when I was a kid I can watch alien and I was scared.

339
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:36,350
Scott: Scott horror doesn't mean it scares you But now I can watch anything and be not scared.

340
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,035
Rym: That doesn't make it not horror.

341
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:39,640
Scott: It makes it not hard.

342
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,954
Rym: Why horror doesn't necessarily mean scare?

343
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:46,870
Scott: I do know one thing though Joe out and go boo is not scary.

344
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,318
Rym: horrors can be existential crisis.

345
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:56,180
Rym: also I think you misunderstand the definitions of horror and macabre and scare and all those different words.

346
00:19:57,044 --> 00:20:04,574
Rym: I think you use a very reductionist definition system I think because you have no joy from games and no joy from jump-scare.

347
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,500
Scott: I think that you are a baby.

348
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,387
Rym: Yeah I'll put this so clever thing.

349
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,092
Rym: Freddy Fazbear fucking.

350
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,880
Rym: he got into the room and I had both doors shut.

351
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,205
Rym: So I gotta figure out how that works.

352
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:17,312
Scott: But uh, he was already in the room.

353
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:29,092
Rym: as he comes to kill you You'll notice that on his face are two pretty clear handprints Obviously from someone else he killed trying to resist him.

354
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:31,440
Rym: There's a lot of subtle things like that.

355
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:40,612
Rym: So anyway things of the day because Scott has no joy from games.

356
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:41,976
Scott: We should watch my thing today.

357
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:42,959
Rym: No, I did not.

358
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,314
Rym: I was busy setting up the stream.

359
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:46,200
Rym: that appears to be failing.

360
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:52,360
Scott: So my thing of the day this dude His only flaw in his entire life was being a Phoenix Coyotes fan.

361
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:55,211
Scott: If you did not know hockey is soon preseason.

362
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:57,640
Scott: hockey is now it is hockey time.

363
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,857
Scott: Yeah, we did pretty good at hockey last year.

364
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,377
Scott: So hockey this year of course is even more exciting than usual which is the most exciting sport can possibly be.

365
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:10,588
Scott: Yeah, so This guy this Phoenix Coyotes fan.

366
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:11,933
Scott: He set up a thing in his house.

367
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:13,840
Scott: That is the glory of glories.

368
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:20,000
Scott: He took two Lights the kind of light that caught a detective will put on top of his car.

369
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,416
Scott: Alright, he put him side by side.

370
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:32,230
Scott: Oh, oh, so if there's a goal of his television, he also connected to this system his stereo.

371
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:34,219
Scott: if There is a goal.

372
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,140
Scott: He pushes a button on the remote and there are four different song selections to play in the event of goal.

373
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:42,008
Scott: It is glorious.

374
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:43,660
Scott: It is majestic.

375
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:50,629
Scott: I need to set this up in everyone's house that in case I watch hockey at their house I can press the button.

376
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,605
Scott: the only thing I can play the same music They play at Madison Square Garden.

377
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,111
Scott: when there's a goal you need a crowd.

378
00:21:55,191 --> 00:22:02,740
Rym: at the authentic home Arena experience you need a crowd that or a crowd simulator in your house.

379
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,594
Scott: Is there a market for this simulate being at the arena in your house?

380
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:11,438
Scott: Once we have like oculus rift It's it's like you're at the arena even though you're at your house.

381
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,270
Scott: Everyone everyone is sitting at center ice everybody for me.

382
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,059
Rym: There is definitely definitely a market for this.

383
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:25,303
Scott: I would buy if I could watch live sports as if I'm in the arena and it feels like I'm in the arena and looks Like I'm in the arena.

384
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,490
Scott: I would buy an oculus drift for that.

385
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:28,454
Scott: get on it.

386
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:29,999
Scott: I know listeners work there.

387
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:36,557
Scott: I don't think you listen though But there are people I know who work there and I'm gonna tell them.

388
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:38,965
Rym: The thing is you need you need.

389
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:49,642
Rym: the crowd simulator would have to simulate the physical feeling of a human being Jumping up next to you and elbow you in the face as he yells and screams at the top of his lungs getting beer spilled On you.

390
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:54,485
Scott: Yeah, you need a delivery company to bring the proper food The smells the cold.

391
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:57,759
Scott: you got to get the temperature of the ice, you know, you could be cold put on a coat.

392
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,074
Scott: Where your Jersey?

393
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:01,446
Scott: Yeah You know the whole thing.

394
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,298
Rym: so my thinking today this was this is one of those things It was funnier than it had any right to be.

395
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:09,045
Rym: it's called super bad Mario.

396
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:09,487
Rym: just a video.

397
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:19,859
Rym: someone made of bunch of people having a fail video moment and They have added Mario such that Mario is the cause of their fail.

398
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:22,739
Rym: That sounds like a really simple and dumb idea.

399
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:24,205
Rym: Shits hilarious.

400
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:26,434
Rym: It's way funnier than it should be.

401
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:27,176
Scott: It's alright.

402
00:23:27,317 --> 00:23:27,799
Scott: That's pretty good.

403
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:31,291
Scott: This feels like old-school internet like five ten years ago.

404
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:33,197
Rym: Yeah, like blumpy org kind of stuff.

405
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,100
Scott: Yeah, I'm into this.

406
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,707
Rym: It's doing them at a moment.

407
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,295
Rym: The book club book is a canticle for Liebowitz.

408
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:38,259
Rym: I guess Scott finished it.

409
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:41,436
Scott: I'm very close to finishing it now that what very close.

410
00:23:41,557 --> 00:23:43,928
Scott: I'll finish it Tonight or tomorrow night.

411
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:45,419
Rym: Did you get to the Green Star part?

412
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:51,955
Scott: No, I'm at the part where they're about to get in a spaceship to leave because it's not good.

413
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:53,840
Rym: who's getting on a spaceship?

414
00:23:55,643 --> 00:24:00,000
Rym: Catholics, yeah That pretty much sums up a canticle for Liebowitz.

415
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:04,497
Rym: I feel like I could review each of the three sections complete like I have a completely different.

416
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:04,958
Rym: Yes.

417
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,686
Scott: Yes That's how it's gonna go down.

418
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,293
Scott: So let's get to the main bit.

419
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:09,474
Scott: Yeah.

420
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:10,800
Scott: Oh, is there any other meta moments?

421
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,652
Rym: Yes, so we're live streaming this but it appears to have failed on multiple fronts.

422
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:16,635
Scott: bad technology.

423
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:18,400
Rym: Yeah, so we'll see.

424
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,548
Rym: I'm giving YouTube some or Google some feedback.

425
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:23,399
Scott: We're actually working with YouTube on some streaming stuff.

426
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:26,733
Scott: Basically, we're giving them feedback on the streaming stuff.

427
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:29,125
Scott: Yeah, so YouTube streaming.

428
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:32,439
Scott: look out on our both of our channels for streaming YouTube type stuff.

429
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:42,900
Scott: Yeah Really, you know actually started another channel separate from my main channel for that because like we've used which reviews YouTube and YouTube is just From a streamers point of view technology wise.

430
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:44,805
Scott: YouTube is just better.

431
00:24:45,326 --> 00:24:48,093
Scott: the major flaws the audience that twitch brings.

432
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:52,390
Scott: like I can start a gaming a game on twitch and people will Find me and start watching who don't even know me.

433
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,059
Scott: Yeah, not so much on YouTube.

434
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:57,547
Rym: So, yeah, the only other things are packs.

435
00:24:57,607 --> 00:24:58,489
Rym: Australia is coming up.

436
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,978
Rym: I'm doing not one but two lectures all by yourself.

437
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:07,139
Rym: on Saturday I am performing Losing and on Sunday winning winning.

438
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:17,833
Rym: It's a rehash of how to win at games, but a little more Rym style and then not too far away as PAX South Where we will be there in attendance.

439
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:19,140
Scott: I should buy flights to PAX South.

440
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,469
Rym: I am now attending five fucking packs as a year.

441
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,775
Scott: So watch out pegs dev sort account.

442
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:32,513
Rym: Oh pegs dev is definitely Getting better every time I go and is definitely one of my must-go-to conventions at this point.

443
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,916
Rym: Mm-hmm.

444
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:35,380
Rym: So PAX Prime.

445
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:43,520
Rym: we Got together a posse Some new people as usual classic packs in packs.

446
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:52,460
Rym: Uh prime's tabletop was a little sub optimal due to the fact that the library was in the Convention Center And all the actual gaming space was in a faraway.

447
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:03,260
Scott: we're still gaming tables in the Convention Center as usual, but not many mad crowded full hard to get into and Also, basically it ended up it was a pain in the ass to use the game library.

448
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,668
Rym: So we never checked anything out of the game library.

449
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,920
Rym: So we were dependent solely on games that we collectively brought.

450
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:12,558
Rym: Our friends brought a game called Pandante.

451
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:19,860
Scott: Pandante is made by Serlin games who you may know from such other games as Yomi and puzzle strike.

452
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:33,408
Scott: Serlin is the dude who sort of thinks the same things that we do is all about winning and playing a win and stuff like that and he's a dude who is like big in the fighting game community, but Wasn't as good at moving his hands really fast.

453
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,798
Scott: He's much better at it than we are but not you know Not good enough to be pro.

454
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:49,380
Scott: That's why he made games like Yomi and puzzle strike which are like these skill-winning type games that lets you Experience that high-level interplay without needing to master basic low-level skills along the way.

455
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,100
Scott: So the new game from Serlin games relatively new at least is Pandante.

456
00:26:53,482 --> 00:27:01,313
Rym: This is the kind of game that and when we describe it to you, you'll feel this It's the kind of game that people like us usually will ignore or shut up.

457
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:01,734
Scott: Right?

458
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:06,627
Scott: So it's Texas holding poker With two key differences, right?

459
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:10,779
Scott: There are other differences, but there are two key differences difference number one pandas.

460
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:12,585
Scott: Difference number two.

461
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:22,540
Rym: It's a different deck of cards not usual deck of cards Yep, and and it's interesting because what this game does at its core is it takes say Texas?

462
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:29,630
Rym: Hold them which you need to be good at poker to enjoy, Texas Hold them pretty much or have so much money.

463
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,814
Scott: You don't care that you lose.

464
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,520
Rym: Well, you don't have to play for money.

465
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,645
Rym: I mean we didn't play this for money.

466
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:35,974
Scott: Wow, Texas hold them without money is good.

467
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:37,219
Rym: Well, then you're just playing for points.

468
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:38,626
Scott: but that's the thing.

469
00:27:38,646 --> 00:27:41,058
Rym: the if you play Texas hold them.

470
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:51,239
Rym: the Differentiator of skill between like the person who's got like nine points of skill the person who has eight point eight points Only comes out over a long period of play.

471
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,900
Rym: pandante Distills that so that it's a relatively short game.

472
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:07,175
Rym: It plays more like a German board game or like the kind of table of games we like and you get the brain Feel and the excitement of the important rounds of Texas.

473
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:16,153
Rym: hold them without having to play 100 rounds of Texas hold them and without having for most of them Everyone just folds right away exactly and they're for almost no money.

474
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:20,127
Scott: And then the big one happens exactly Dante Every round is the big round.

475
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:23,539
Rym: So this game much like I said for that my thing of the day video.

476
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:28,636
Rym: It's a game that has is way more fun than has a right to be and we've resisted.

477
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:37,196
Rym: when our friends are like Hey, let's play this game We were like we'll play it once So we can review it and then we finish and then we all relate it the most.

478
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:38,360
Rym: so we should we play it again?

479
00:28:38,681 --> 00:28:39,544
Rym: Should we play it again?

480
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:41,352
Rym: Should we play it again one night?

481
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:43,380
Rym: We played it all night until they kicked us out.

482
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,063
Scott: It was just really.

483
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,640
Scott: the other thing is just so easy to play compared to other games that had much more setup.

484
00:28:48,182 --> 00:28:52,780
Scott: You know all this is just take a deck of cards shuffle them give everyone some chips and plates.

485
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:56,010
Scott: You know, it's more set up than say sushi go.

486
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:59,040
Scott: Yeah, but it's a lot less set up even than seven wonders.

487
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,968
Scott: We got to sort all the cards out and everything.

488
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:04,120
Rym: So the subtle key difference is to explain the game in detail.

489
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:04,885
Rym: It's pretty simple.

490
00:29:05,288 --> 00:29:06,879
Rym: you play basically, Texas hold him.

491
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:13,420
Rym: But when you buy into a hand and you bid on a hand, you're not just bidding like I have the best hand.

492
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:16,119
Rym: You're not putting money in saying I got the best hand or fold.

493
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,316
Rym: You're betting on what hand you will have by the end right.

494
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:23,820
Scott: you're betting on a specific hand.

495
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:25,924
Scott: There are ten hands You can possibly have.

496
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:30,260
Scott: you put a chip onto one of them and you can't bet some crazy different amounts either.

497
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,946
Scott: You can't be like all-in on pair.

498
00:29:32,388 --> 00:29:35,560
Scott: It's you bet a fixed amount or you quit, right?

499
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,835
Scott: So it's either bet five on one of the ten hands or fold.

500
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:41,080
Scott: Those are your two options.

501
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:44,011
Scott: So I'll bet five on three of a kind.

502
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:45,517
Scott: I have a three of a kind.

503
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:46,380
Scott: is what you're saying?

504
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:48,170
Rym: Yep, or I will.

505
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:49,959
Rym: I will have three of a kind.

506
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:52,148
Scott: I will eventually have three of a kind.

507
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:54,075
Scott: not I will have at least three of a kind.

508
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:55,320
Scott: not I will have.

509
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:58,080
Scott: You know something, you know better than three.

510
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:59,749
Scott: I will have exactly three of a kind.

511
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:03,249
Scott: if you have four of a kind and you bet on three of a kind Well, I guess that includes three of a kind.

512
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:05,100
Scott: but you don't get your credit for your four of a kind.

513
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:06,898
Scott: You only get the credit for what you bet on.

514
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:22,171
Rym: So the game works pretty much like Texas Hold'em in that regard though because you go down the river Pulling up cards along the way, but every time a new card comes out you have to bet you have to fold or Bet at or better than what you already bet on.

515
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:28,313
Scott: so you might have like you might be going for I don't know an inside straight right and you think that's.

516
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:29,336
Rym: that's a great idea.

517
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,360
Scott: You might be getting it.

518
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,982
Scott: You never know.

519
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:32,468
Scott: You're not getting you're only gonna spend.

520
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:34,075
Scott: you think I can spend ten bucks to see.

521
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:35,240
Scott: maybe a miracle will happen.

522
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:44,917
Scott: So you bet on straight and then you bet on straight again and Then you bet and meanwhile you just got like a three of a kind.

523
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:47,086
Scott: but Sorry, bro.

524
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,049
Rym: You can't go down.

525
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:50,680
Scott: You know, you can't go down to three of a kind.

526
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:53,940
Scott: So even though you have it, it's basically meaningless.

527
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:58,480
Rym: So there's another mechanic here much like how Texas Hold'em has all of its terminology.

528
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,159
Rym: It's poker terminology.

529
00:31:00,622 --> 00:31:03,138
Rym: Pandante has panda equivalents of that.

530
00:31:04,022 --> 00:31:12,065
Rym: So you buy breakfast you buy you take breakfast if you want then you have snacks and then you do like the paws and the Tail and all these little things.

531
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:20,984
Rym: so it has this fun little like interplay of using the words in the nomenclature of the game To the point that it started messing up my poker Brain.

532
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:23,955
Scott: now the snacks are actually a big component in the game right.

533
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:32,069
Scott: the way the snacks work is If you are the highest bidder in terms like I'm betting on straight blood Flush I got a flush.

534
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,455
Scott: That's not as good as a straight flush.

535
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:34,400
Scott: I got a flush good.

536
00:31:35,322 --> 00:31:42,388
Scott: If you are the highest better at any given snack time you get free snacks Which means from your you know hidden cards.

537
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:45,799
Scott: you can throw some out and you draw a card and then?

538
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:49,720
Rym: You may or may not keep that card throwing away another card.

539
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:54,760
Rym: So you still have two cards, but you can swallow in and out by going big and betting big.

540
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:58,476
Scott: You actually have a chance to make that big a reality.

541
00:31:58,656 --> 00:31:59,480
Scott: with all the snacks.

542
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:02,660
Scott: You can still get snacks if you are not the highest better.

543
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:11,151
Scott: But you have to pay for those snacks and the further away you are from the top the more you have to pay if you're Betting on pair and someone else is betting on straight flush.

544
00:32:11,191 --> 00:32:17,072
Scott: You have to pay like 20 bucks To have a chance at snacks, so there's already a good.

545
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,460
Rym: You know because what's the fun part of Texas holding?

546
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,745
Rym: What's the fun part of poker?

547
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:24,459
Scott: the big bluffing and being and everyone falls for it?

548
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:26,593
Scott: And you make mad money when you had nothing.

549
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:33,515
Rym: this game distills poker into the bluffing and the odds and nothing else and it does it quickly.

550
00:32:33,876 --> 00:32:44,213
Rym: so I might I Might bet a flouche even though I could not possibly have a flouche And I intend to fold just to make everybody's snacks more expensive.

551
00:32:44,414 --> 00:32:47,665
Scott: and because I can see even though I can't possibly have a flouche.

552
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:50,274
Scott: Maybe the snacks will make a flouche happen.

553
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:53,545
Scott: Yeah, so And I'll get free snacks.

554
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:57,358
Rym: the game obviously because the deck is not a normal poker deck.

555
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:00,447
Rym: the Hands you can get our difference right.

556
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:03,014
Scott: so there are six suits with ten cards pursued.

557
00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:04,659
Scott: number one Joker one through ten.

558
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:06,769
Scott: When do you guys examine it?

559
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,910
Scott: Oh?

560
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,634
Scott: No is there a ten?

561
00:33:07,794 --> 00:33:08,639
Scott: Oh is it two through ten?

562
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,007
Rym: I think it's one through ten.

563
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,514
Scott: that would make eleven.

564
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,403
Scott: Yeah, right What are you nine?

565
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:14,906
Rym: I don't remember.

566
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:15,830
Scott: I think it's two through ten.

567
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,800
Scott: I don't remember anyway.

568
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:22,671
Scott: Also the six colors, and then there's one wild card.

569
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:23,393
Scott: Whoa.

570
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:24,397
Scott: It's a wild card.

571
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,944
Scott: Yeah watch out It's prismatic.

572
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:31,080
Rym: It's got all the colors, and there's some fun rules around that, but there's only one wild card.

573
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,640
Rym: Yep, and there's some special rules around the wild card.

574
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:49,780
Rym: So you play the game you bet everybody bets you buy snacks if you want and then another card comes out in the in the community cards and then you bet snacks and you do this three times and Then the show everybody gets to use a power.

575
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:54,937
Scott: So this is actually another bluffing aspect right based on the colors of the cards.

576
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:57,190
Scott: in your hand There are six powers.

577
00:33:57,271 --> 00:34:03,800
Scott: six colors six powers You can it goes around and each person gets to claim zero one or two powers.

578
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:06,268
Scott: Right and try to use those powers.

579
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:09,739
Scott: so I can be like I'm gonna do the red power twice.

580
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:14,760
Scott: The red power is put five bucks in or if everyone puts five bucks in or folds.

581
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:21,063
Scott: So doing that twice means everyone in the whole game has to put in ten bucks or fold except me because I'm using the power Right.

582
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:23,926
Scott: oh No, I think I have to do it too right.

583
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:24,670
Rym: What?

584
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,580
Rym: no no you don't remember this game at all.

585
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,629
Scott: I only played it effects.

586
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:28,496
Scott: It was already a month ago.

587
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:32,610
Rym: So bravery every other player must put in five gold right fold.

588
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,620
Rym: so you evilness draw a card then discard a card.

589
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,679
Rym: But you have to reveal a card that you kept.

590
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,731
Rym: Orange deal a sixth community car.

591
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:43,255
Scott: oh shit everybody gets that.

592
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,983
Scott: it happens a lot of blue Privately.

593
00:34:46,023 --> 00:34:48,449
Rym: see a random card from a highest hand.

594
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:52,110
Rym: so someone who's beating you as a highest hand you can see a card in their hand.

595
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:57,613
Rym: Black the fun one greed steal five dollars from the lowest hand.

596
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:00,340
Rym: unless they reveal a blue card from their hand.

597
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,460
Scott: Hopelessness purple you get to fold because normally you can't fold at that point you're already in too deep.

598
00:35:06,942 --> 00:35:11,240
Scott: But that's like last-minute folding so you can pull some shenanigans and then fold if they don't work.

599
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,660
Rym: And there's a clever mechanic where if you use a power you can declare up to two powers because you can have two cards.

600
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,468
Rym: You know your car.

601
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:18,418
Rym: you have two cards in your hole.

602
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,871
Rym: Anyone can challenge you and there's a challenge mechanic like you.

603
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:25,640
Scott: you're not showing your two hidden cards, and you use these powers.

604
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,469
Scott: I'm like I'm using two red powers red power twice.

605
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,395
Scott: Yeah, people can either say okay.

606
00:35:30,435 --> 00:35:35,571
Scott: We'll do the red power twice or They can say challenge you you don't have two red cards.

607
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:40,780
Scott: the cards are designed in such a way That you can reveal their color without revealing their number.

608
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:44,759
Rym: So I have to then either say yeah, you got me, and then I owe them some money.

609
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,082
Scott: Yeah, because they challenged me I was lying.

610
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:52,340
Rym: I give them money or I show them the colors and then they owe me money.

611
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:54,020
Scott: Yep, they challenged me, and they were wrong.

612
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,387
Scott: I did have two red cards so they got to give me one which can be great.

613
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:05,871
Rym: if say I'm Bluffing that I have a flouche and I show a card that corroborates my story that I have a flouche You

614
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:11,853
Scott: might really need say to use the orange power to have a chance at this hand winning but

615
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:12,859
Rym: using that don't have

616
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,228
Scott: any orange cards or

617
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:19,284
Rym: Using it implies that I don't have the hand and I'm hail marrying right

618
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,872
Scott: or you might have a really shitty hand and want to Say purple.

619
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,630
Scott: I'm gonna fold to just get escape, but you don't have a purple and someone calls you out on it.

620
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:27,527
Scott: That's the worst.

621
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:32,756
Scott: Or your hand is totally awesome And you want to kick some ass.

622
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:46,564
Scott: so you use red or black to take money from people But you don't have red or black and you get called if you have the crazy awesome, and sometimes you'll use orange or green Just to make everyone think that you're actually bluffing.

623
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:50,300
Scott: yeah, if you're using orange or green It seems like you're desperately trying to get a good hand.

624
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:56,470
Scott: people think you don't have the real hand But all you did was just draw a card and throw one away, and then you go down the challenges.

625
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:05,150
Rym: So after the powers after all that the cards are out there whoever has the highest hand Everyone has a chance to either challenge them right or say yeah, you win.

626
00:37:05,331 --> 00:37:08,530
Scott: I bet on five of a kind and no one else bet on anything close to five of a kind.

627
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:12,228
Scott: I just win without revealing anything whatsoever unless you challenge me.

628
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:20,350
Rym: so Challenges in this stage are interesting because in on normal challenges with the powers if you are wrong you owe the other person some money.

629
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,174
Rym: It's not a big deal.

630
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:30,961
Rym: if you challenge someone's hand And they're winning and you're right you get a little bit of money And of course they don't win mm-hmm in the neck meeting.

631
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,005
Scott: that goes down to the next person.

632
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:35,879
Rym: if you challenge someone And you're wrong they actually have the hand.

633
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:37,043
Scott: I have five of a kind.

634
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,130
Scott: read him and weep you are fucked.

635
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:41,646
Rym: You owe them so much money.

636
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,016
Rym: It is Devastated.

637
00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:43,882
Scott: you just lose the game.

638
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:44,587
Scott: basically yeah.

639
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:57,410
Rym: So if you are not challenged and you win and you were bluffing You can tell everyone yo dogs I was bluffing you're stupid.

640
00:37:57,972 --> 00:38:00,801
Rym: And then you get to draw a panda Lord.

641
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:04,995
Scott: this panda Lords are so ridiculously Waggles.

642
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,828
Rym: all about waggles fuck everybody else.

643
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,889
Scott: Pretty much only took waggles because he was so much better than the other pen.

644
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:14,170
Rym: well I think we took waggles mostly because of the waggle action on the card.

645
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:16,149
Scott: It's also an excellent reason to take waggles.

646
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:20,689
Rym: But the panda Lord if you have him have one and you can just take one.

647
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,994
Rym: There's one of every color.

648
00:38:22,696 --> 00:38:24,281
Rym: they just have weird powers like waggles.

649
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,946
Rym: power is the triple play quote.

650
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:33,010
Rym: during the ability phase You can play up to three different abilities that cannot be challenged.

651
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:42,310
Scott: So you could just be like red red red everyone put 15 in the middle or fold everyone right now And you lose waggles, but you know hey, that's ridiculously strong.

652
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:51,637
Scott: Yeah So if you basically bluff your way to victory on one hand you get a panda Lord which comes close to Ensuring victory on a future hand.

653
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:59,087
Scott: so when it does a huge incentive to win via bluffing So what look again the design of the game is?

654
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,730
Rym: Pushing you toward the fun parts of poker And it's kind of glossing over the really really tedious parts of poker.

655
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:11,196
Scott: But at the same so while it's basically pushes you huge incentives.

656
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:12,618
Scott: Just bluff your way to victory.

657
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:30,582
Scott: at the same time it ridiculously punishes anyone for Challenging if you're right, so it's like you have this built-in defense Making it sort of easier to actually bluff your way to victory because people are scared to challenge you if you actually have the hand Because they will just be fucked if you do have the hand.

658
00:39:30,642 --> 00:39:39,965
Rym: now in my experience playing the game Nobody ever fucking has the hand except that one time The early games pretty much that we played.

659
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:44,361
Scott: of this everyone One person actually had the hand and someone challenged them.

660
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:45,604
Scott: that person was out.

661
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,530
Scott: the person who had the hand won the game the end.

662
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,669
Scott: Because they just got so much money from that it was over.

663
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:54,850
Scott: Yeah, not only did they get the money from winning the pot they got the money from the person who just got hosed.

664
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,843
Scott: I think what happened is they had so much money.

665
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:57,850
Scott: They couldn't be unseated.

666
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,897
Scott: They won a second hand.

667
00:39:58,917 --> 00:39:59,381
Scott: then they had.

668
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:00,609
Scott: that was enough money to win the game.

669
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:05,224
Rym: But then I think pretty quickly what happened is our friends started getting competent at the game.

670
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:15,508
Rym: part of the problem was that it's not easy to calculate the odds or Viscerally feel the odds of the six color ten card deck.

671
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:19,801
Scott: yeah It was very hard to calculate the likelihood of like.

672
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:20,643
Scott: what are the odds?

673
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:23,010
Scott: he has a flouche pretty good actually.

674
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,160
Scott: There's like ten cards of that color right.

675
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,349
Scott: so the odds of those is he's got two of them.

676
00:40:27,812 --> 00:40:30,090
Rym: So like a nice had like five snacks.

677
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:37,098
Scott: He's seen like seven cards this game and plus the ones in the table It's like they could easily be well houses right.

678
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:40,570
Rym: not that hard to get flushes slightly harder to get.

679
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:44,829
Rym: I don't know if it's because it's on the far right side or because we just really like the word flouche.

680
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:47,241
Scott: Only a panda would know what a flouche is.

681
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:52,221
Rym: yep, it says in the instruction manual The game's flavor text and just that.

682
00:40:52,281 --> 00:41:00,146
Rym: the art and everything on the cards was well done to the point that We started using its terminology despite making fun of how dumb its terminology was.

683
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:06,355
Rym: when we learned the game Flouche became the breakaway word of PAX For the rest of the weekend.

684
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:10,630
Scott: Yeah fuck your official swear word flouche is the official word of PAX Prime.

685
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:18,716
Rym: I think the problem was we looked up flouche on Urban Dictionary and came up with something involving a female ejaculation whatever.

686
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:29,877
Rym: so a Few of us looked that up and laughed about it And then everyone else came back and then someone bet on a flouche who was not there when we had looked it up And that sealed the deal.

687
00:41:30,097 --> 00:41:35,057
Scott: the other thing about this game is all the pandas on the cards have really great Expressions especially the number one.

688
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:38,290
Scott: where the pen is put in the red the pen is putting his hands in the air like what?

689
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:39,193
Scott: Raise the roof.

690
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:46,830
Rym: our convention was if you win you have to make the red one pose Unless you win with a panel or then you have to make the pose of that panel.

691
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,467
Scott: Oh, but basically we kept making the poses of all the pandas and saying flouche a lot.

692
00:41:51,648 --> 00:41:56,550
Rym: Yeah This is a must-have in your game library.

693
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:01,468
Scott: If you're the kind of takes up somewhat little space and you probably already have poker chips of some kind.

694
00:42:01,508 --> 00:42:10,563
Rym: if you're a gamer yeah, it's a deck of cards special deck of cards a couple of challenge cards and Little betting cards that remind you like what the order of this.

695
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:13,288
Scott: you don't even really need the betting cards You really just need the deck.

696
00:42:13,673 --> 00:42:14,909
Rym: I think you need the betting cards.

697
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:20,218
Scott: So it'll tell you very helpful if people don't know how to play but once you're all good at the game You don't need that anymore.

698
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:21,670
Rym: I think you'll always need them.

699
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,420
Rym: So you will never forget the order of victory.

700
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:29,150
Scott: if you play the game enough, you will know the order of victory.

701
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:32,729
Rym: Yeah, just you're gonna remember that the straight is less than a full house less than a flouche.

702
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,530
Scott: Yes, because it's much easier to get a straight when there's six suits.

703
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:39,761
Rym: yep, but a rainbow straight versus four or five of a kind.

704
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:46,803
Scott: a rainbow straight is less than four of a kind and less than five and I see you can see that over my shoulder because I have the betting.

705
00:42:46,843 --> 00:42:49,573
Scott: no because I remember that rainbow straight Is in the top left.

706
00:42:49,653 --> 00:43:02,700
Rym: now flouche is in the bottom right and then just to the left of flouche should be Regular straight but seriously if you run board game nights if you were the guy who shows up at a con and has like hey I got a game we should play.

707
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,695
Rym: this is The.

708
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:07,649
Rym: this is like the perfect example of a social game.

709
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:18,709
Rym: That is good to get everybody warmed up and to get the kinds of people who don't want to learn a difficult game and balk At playing a game to start playing a game and get really invested in it.

710
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,173
Scott: I think this is also really good.

711
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:21,416
Scott: you find those people.

712
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:22,979
Scott: I know a lot of them who are?

713
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:30,810
Scott: They like to play poker right there in the Texas hold them whatever, but it's hard to get them to play real board games.

714
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,197
Scott: This could be the bridge game.

715
00:43:32,258 --> 00:43:41,473
Scott: you can get them into sort of that like flouche culture While they're still playing a poker ish game that the like and you can go straight from flouche culture to brick for wood Culture.

716
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:43,321
Scott: yeah, you can and that's the bridge.

717
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:45,310
Scott: you can get them over the heap if they're unwilling to display.

718
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,458
Rym: So here's how Sirlin sells it himself.

719
00:43:47,498 --> 00:43:48,763
Rym: He just gives you a set of bullet points.

720
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:50,510
Rym: No player elimination.

721
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,115
Scott: Well, I guess you're not permanently eliminated.

722
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:53,837
Rym: We'll get to that.

723
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:59,069
Rym: Yeah, no you don't have to fold all the time like you do in human poker.

724
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:04,886
Scott: It is panda poker though seriously as an aside, but you do fold a lot.

725
00:44:04,906 --> 00:44:09,590
Rym: folding is if you Play poker with people and you are not a poker person.

726
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:15,228
Rym: My only advice to you is you need to fold about five times more often than you think you do.

727
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:26,359
Scott: last time I played poker for real monies in college I basically just folded whenever I didn't have a hand and didn't fold when I did have a hand and started raising the roof and I just had.

728
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:36,585
Scott: when I lost because I had no hand I lost almost nothing and then when I did have the hand someone usually stayed in and I had the hand so I made mad money and then I won.

729
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:37,450
Rym: quote.

730
00:44:37,832 --> 00:44:41,890
Rym: It's actually fun to play for its own sake when no real money is on the line.

731
00:44:42,191 --> 00:44:52,750
Rym: The pandas are laughing and joking the whole way through that is true but The game has to set it as its core rules and you can just play it and it's totally fun.

732
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,623
Rym: Just pick up game go nuts poker.

733
00:44:54,643 --> 00:44:55,529
Rym: It's awesome.

734
00:44:57,011 --> 00:45:04,212
Rym: Then there's a section where Serlin's like so if you want to play it for real money if you're panda enough to play it for Real money.

735
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:05,316
Scott: Are you panda?

736
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:08,730
Rym: No, here are the four serious rules and all.

737
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:11,116
Scott: What's the difference with real money?

738
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:13,286
Rym: Well, I mean you're playing with real money.

739
00:45:13,326 --> 00:45:14,050
Scott: What's the fixed bet?

740
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,703
Scott: You said it like at a dime.

741
00:45:15,724 --> 00:45:18,268
Rym: I forget It's basically the same.

742
00:45:19,152 --> 00:45:20,375
Scott: It's grandly the same.

743
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:32,483
Rym: the only difference is the bank doesn't cover the money that you owe when bullshit happens In the forest and get free money from the bank to come back in after you've lost.

744
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,896
Rym: you can buy back in with money money.

745
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:43,510
Rym: Yeah, so I kind of wanted to try playing this with real money effects.

746
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:44,917
Rym: No one else was super into it.

747
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:46,183
Scott: I'm not super into jail.

748
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:49,190
Rym: I Would not be worried about Jen.

749
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,050
Scott: I'm sure if you played games for real money in four and enforcers noticed you would not be welcome.

750
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,483
Rym: Oh Scott, even if you're playing for real money, you use poker chips.

751
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,908
