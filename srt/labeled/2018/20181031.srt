00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,077
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:35,819
Rym: Good God, we've been doing it not a long time.

10
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:37,486
Scott: All right, that's it.

11
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:37,848
Scott: we're done.

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,025
Rym: just stop just drop the mic walk away Good and go home.

13
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:53,606
Rym: And if I go into the archive and go all the way back October 31st 2005 we did our first episode called arguing science and then the next day we did an episode called Video game argument.

14
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:57,177
Rym: Okay, so you can see where how we've evolved over time.

15
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,020
Scott: Not at all.

16
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:01,080
Rym: We don't argue that much on the show anymore.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,060
Rym: We argue before the show because you never want to do any of the topics.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,788
Scott: That's right, cuz your topics are bad.

19
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:06,934
Rym: My topics are real bad.

20
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:08,100
Rym: I got great topics.

21
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:10,814
Rym: All right, you got any news?

22
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,786
Scott: son Do you have a news?

23
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:20,617
Scott: so, you know, there's a lot of Great animated series that have been made by Channel Frederator or whatever.

24
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:23,405
Scott: They call themselves Like all these different names.

25
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:25,070
Scott: I don't know the red robot head.

26
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:28,760
Scott: Anyway, yep shows like bravest warriors and being puppy cat.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,744
Scott: Those are the main two.

28
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:30,950
Scott: all the other ones are lesser.

29
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:33,100
Scott: We everyone except for the one with the dolphin that goes.

30
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:40,087
Scott: Yeah, I forget what that one's called but anyway For a while.

31
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:42,180
Scott: They just posted episodes on YouTube and it was great.

32
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:49,020
Scott: And then they like moved all their stuff to like some other weird services and I couldn't like verve.

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,753
Scott: I don't fucking know how to how to watch their content.

34
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:53,199
Scott: So I stopped watching the content.

35
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,203
Rym: I mean the point.

36
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:56,131
Rym: we're already like most content.

37
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:58,500
Rym: I watch not this stuff just other things like cartoon.

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,609
Scott: Hey, is it cartoon hangover or is it Frederator?

39
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:01,674
Scott: It's like it's only different names.

40
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:12,488
Scott: Anyway, I Point is they now have a come back to YouTube so you can get full episodes of being puppy cat on YouTube Which is good because I fucking kick-started them.

41
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:13,633
Scott: I paid.

42
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:14,376
Scott: I should be able to see them.

43
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:18,378
Scott: I paid the money but also new episodes.

44
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:20,584
Scott: Finally.

45
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:23,074
Scott: finally, it's not like oh we're working on them.

46
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:24,520
Scott: It's like no we waited long enough.

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,801
Scott: How long?

48
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:26,066
Scott: we've been waiting a long-ass time.

49
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,371
Scott: Yeah, we waited long enough.

50
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:27,552
Scott: Now.

51
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:27,954
Scott: They're here.

52
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,540
Scott: We were our patients paid off.

53
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:31,419
Scott: There's more being puppy cat.

54
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:35,938
Rym: Imminently I was wearing my be pin today coincidentally, uh-huh.

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,328
Rym: So they don't have a puppy cat van only have a beep.

56
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:48,693
Scott: Yeah, if you have not seen any be puppy cat brave warriors or other cartoon hangover slash Frederator slash whatever other names their studios have.

57
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:48,974
Scott: I don't.

58
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:50,280
Scott: they're all mixed up.

59
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,179
Scott: Yeah, they make good stuff and you don't need a television with cable to see it.

60
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:58,851
Scott: You can see it on YouTube cartoon hangover cartoon hangover.

61
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:00,136
Rym: select on verve.

62
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:01,460
Rym: watch now on verve.

63
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:03,647
Scott: Yeah, those are probably older videos.

64
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:05,633
Scott: that when they were still I don't know.

65
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:06,475
Scott: But yeah.

66
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:07,940
Rym: Yeah, I pretty much do this.

67
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:09,793
Rym: I feel like I'm not going on verb.

68
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:18,768
Rym: I'll go to Netflix I go to crunchyroll go to Amazon video and if it's not in any of those places Usually I end up on the Pirate Bay next.

69
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:26,755
Scott: Oh that reminds me of another news that I Just now that I didn't include in our news list because it was from like a week ago.

70
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,140
Rym: All right, I'll type it in.

71
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:33,160
Scott: There was a. there was an alliance between I don't know people know this crunchyroll and funimation had an alliance.

72
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:40,755
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's actually kind of bad news and this alliance allowed some significant amount of funimation.

73
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:50,735
Scott: shows Shows the funimation of the rights to in America to be on crunchyroll and I think possibly vice versa So that you didn't really need to pay for funimation.

74
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:51,760
Scott: Everyone just paid for crunchyroll.

75
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:57,679
Rym: And yeah I paid for funimation of like once and then I stopped because it wasn't worth it and I just went crunchyroll right.

76
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,928
Scott: the point Is this alliance is officially over.

77
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,739
Scott: there is I guess some date in the future where some on?

78
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:16,447
Scott: Some list of shows that I didn't wasn't able to find yet Will no longer be on crunchyroll because those are funimation shows which means that's bad news because most anime fans are not paying for two separate anime Right.

79
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:18,560
Rym: So also Netflix which also has anime.

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,118
Scott: It's also there's a. there's a website filmstruck which I was paying for but no one else was which had all old movies.

81
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,867
Rym: and now we What happens when no one else pays for it?

82
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,933
Scott: and it's basically there was this idea.

83
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:32,243
Scott: that and drama fever also shutting down the Korean Drama, right?

84
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:38,940
Scott: Basically, there are all these streaming services that we're trying to serve content niches Like hey, you only care about watching old movies.

85
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:40,204
Scott: Don't pay for Netflix.

86
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:42,190
Scott: that has everything a little bit everything.

87
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,112
Scott: pay for this.

88
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:45,640
Scott: that has tons of the one thing that you want.

89
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:50,719
Scott: And but the problem with this is much like cable a la carte cable TV.

90
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:53,769
Scott: Is it's like how many fucking channels.

91
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,194
Scott: am I gonna pay for every one thing?

92
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:59,240
Scott: if they were like a dollar each I could pay for like 10 of these freaking services.

93
00:04:59,422 --> 00:04:59,946
Rym: Well, I guess it's.

94
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:05,439
Scott: it's a little worse than that in that I know each one of these services wants to charge you an arm and a leg.

95
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:08,140
Rym: So I have a limited amount of time irrespective of money.

96
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:17,057
Rym: So even if even if money was not a factor and all these services were free I'm just like most fans of things including me don't have time to watch everything anyway, so whichever you

97
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:24,120
Scott: pay for crunchyroll I only watch maybe like less than 10 shows on total series on crunchyroll per year.

98
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:35,206
Rym: So whatever that's a good value whatever services I go to I'm pretty much just gonna watch something on those services and it is shockingly rare that I will ever Start with a show.

99
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,820
Rym: I want to watch and then go figure out what service it's on.

100
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:45,112
Scott: Well, even when I do start with a show I want to watch I'm not gonna subscribe to like another service Just because I'm like.

101
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:45,959
Scott: I'm already on Netflix.

102
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:49,759
Scott: Right, what I used to do is I used to be like, all right I'm on Hulu watching the Hulu shoes.

103
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:51,324
Scott: Cancel Netflix.

104
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:53,029
Scott: watching the Netflix shows cancel.

105
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,032
Scott: now crunchyroll.

106
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,620
Scott: watching crunchyroll shows cancel and always be one at a time.

107
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,206
Scott: No, but that was a pain in the ass.

108
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:01,680
Rym: So I just keep Netflix and crunchyroll and nothing else exists, right?

109
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,927
Scott: It's like I'll pay for so much.

110
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:04,910
Rym: I'll buy stuff.

111
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,020
Rym: I won't straw just buy like videos on Amazon.

112
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,708
Scott: That's not bad, but it's way too expensive.

113
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:10,712
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

114
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:11,737
Rym: It's not that expensive.

115
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:12,500
Scott: So very expensive.

116
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,579
Rym: Yeah, you know what I bought there.

117
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,091
Rym: Like I bought a lot of the later seasons of Adventure Time there.

118
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,095
Scott: How much were they each?

119
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,100
Rym: I don't even remember.

120
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,330
Scott: Yeah, okay, uncle money bags over here.

121
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:20,691
Scott: It ends up.

122
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:22,740
Rym: Yeah, I'm willing to pay a couple bucks an episode.

123
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,075
Scott: That's a lot for a 15-minute.

124
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:30,116
Rym: There's no other way to make money making content.

125
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:31,020
Scott: That's not my problem.

126
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:35,080
Scott: Anyway, the point is I'm only gonna pay for so many services.

127
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:43,940
Scott: So if you start putting less and less content per service And if the services that I pay for have don't have enough content on them I'll cancel those and just go back to the high seas.

128
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:48,717
Scott: So like if there's a show I want to watch now and it's not on crunchyroll because it's a funimation show.

129
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:55,235
Scott: Yeah Well, there was and if it turns out there's not enough shows on crunchyroll and I'm hardly using it.

130
00:06:55,596 --> 00:07:00,120
Rym: cancel and yeah There were multiple articles recently.

131
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:12,377
Rym: But there's a lot of evidence that because of the increasing fracturing of the streaming like landscape Piracy which was actually like really bottoming out to like near nothing has surged again.

132
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,580
Rym: Yeah, of course I mean not gonna lie.

133
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:20,028
Rym: I went and just downloaded a bunch of the good place from the Pirate Bay a little while ago So you figure out how to watch it.

134
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,518
Scott: Oh, that's just pirates for Halloween.

135
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:32,370
Rym: So the saddest thing with the fun with the funimation thing in particular, you know, why this is happening Specifically yeah, cuz they're jerks.

136
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:37,345
Rym: no because of Sony's acquisition It's always Sony.

137
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:41,679
Rym: Sony is the one that like always if there's a bad decision to be made it's always Sony.

138
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:51,937
Rym: So quote according to a memo sent to staff from funimation president Fukin aga the decision was made as a direct result of the company being acquired by Sony Pictures television.

139
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:52,319
Rym: Mm-hmm.

140
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:57,618
Rym: Sony really wants to directly monetize and is going to do a bad job.

141
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:05,348
Scott: Instead of splitting up and like we're basically spoiling the water and ruining Lean on the central service like crunchyroll.

142
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:12,392
Scott: instead of ruining your service and and the other person service Why don't you just fucking buy crunchyroll and merge?

143
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:20,480
Scott: Yeah crunchyroll and funimation into one Anime owning an America company that takes care of everything and then you'll get all the money.

144
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:21,702
Rym: The.

145
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,629
Rym: so the funniest thing, you know who else has heard by this?

146
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,440
Rym: because a lot of those funimation shows are also on Verve.

147
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:28,992
Rym: Verve is just gonna die.

148
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,760
Rym: I think is nothing's gonna be on Verve anymore.

149
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,024
Scott: Who's paying for a verb?

150
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,990
Scott: Oh, there's another one like high dive.

151
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,580
Rym: I've never even been on verbs website.

152
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:39,164
Scott: What the hell.

153
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:39,990
Scott: what's high dive then?

154
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,554
Scott: I've heard of that.

155
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:41,258
Scott: I don't know what it is.

156
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,886
Scott: It's just another streaming service.

157
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:44,128
Scott: right?

158
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:45,492
Rym: verve is a digital.

159
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,274
Rym: Oh it launched in 2016.

160
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:48,020
Rym: So it's like brand new.

161
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,662
Scott: It's not that?

162
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:53,783
Rym: yeah, it's not old and it bundles together several geek related channels into See.

163
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:59,600
Rym: I feel like the business people making all these decisions just have no idea what consumers of media are like.

164
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:00,768
Scott: Netflix does.

165
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,152
Rym: Netflix is the only one Crunchyroll - crunchyroll knows what's up crunchyroll is like.

166
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:07,180
Scott: why doesn't Netflix buy funimation?

167
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,229
Scott: Well, I guess Sony already bought us a too late.

168
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:09,973
Scott: Yeah, Netflix.

169
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:11,019
Scott: You just like buy crunchyroll.

170
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:13,780
Rym: So this is kind of all bad news.

171
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,600
Rym: But I think the result is just I'm not gonna watch any funimation anime and Amazon really fucked up with that.

172
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:23,376
Scott: Remember they had that the prime anime special thing.

173
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:28,213
Rym: No, that was a bad Bad bad situation of the same enemy strike.

174
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,117
Scott: They fuck that was a fuck-up.

175
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:29,660
Rym: - yep.

176
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:34,943
Rym: So in some other news that we came out of nowhere if you follow Toby Fox on Twitter Who's that?

177
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:36,248
Scott: I've heard that name undertale guy.

178
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,991
Scott: Okay.

179
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:41,369
Scott: He started tweeting a bunch of weird stuff Yeah, and then he put out a games that no one knew was coming.

180
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,860
Rym: Yeah, it's basically just undertale - and it's just free.

181
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,267
Rym: Just like download it and run it.

182
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,739
Rym: Okay, so I don't know anything about it.

183
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:49,546
Rym: Like I've avoided reading about it.

184
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:53,379
Scott: I'm just gonna download this exe and I play it without finishing undertale.

185
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,768
Rym: one Probably not.

186
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:55,412
Rym: I don't.

187
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,660
Rym: I feel like it might not resonate.

188
00:09:56,841 --> 00:10:00,440
Rym: I mean you didn't even get past but one didn't resonate when I was playing it.

189
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,571
Rym: I don't understand how I think undertale is one of the better games ever made.

190
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:04,113
Scott: think it was.

191
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,200
Scott: it's a crappy game maker RPG.

192
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:09,419
Rym: I don't know how you had such trouble getting by papyrus.

193
00:10:10,182 --> 00:10:12,752
Scott: I tried like because I have no patience and I didn't.

194
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,740
Rym: but it's just like a base like it's a shmup.

195
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,583
Rym: It's not hard.

196
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:16,968
Rym: Just move the heart around.

197
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:17,952
Scott: I had no patience.

198
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:20,100
Rym: I didn't give a shit, but I'd be I'd be papyrus.

199
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,545
Rym: I like my second try.

200
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:23,352
Scott: I think I didn't care enough to try.

201
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:23,974
Rym: Okay.

202
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:32,467
Rym: Anyway undertale is a triumph And if you need more undertale, it appears that there is in fact more undertale and it's just here for you and it's probably spooky.

203
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:43,259
Rym: probably have some creepypasta based on the media that I saw around it and all these cryptic cryptic tweets from Someone at undertale that Toby Fox was retweeting.

204
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:48,479
Scott: I definitely got to give credit though to doing one thing right which is just don't.

205
00:10:49,463 --> 00:10:59,723
Scott: there's two ways that I think are the correct way to market media a Keep your fucking mouth shut until it's a hundred percent done and then boom here it is done right.

206
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:08,107
Scott: and way number two be a hundred percent open with everything and say I'm doing this to give daily fucking reports and 100% engage in their community and keep no secrets.

207
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:25,514
Scott: the standard operating procedure for just about everyone in all media is to Hold your cards close to the chest slowly reveal tiny bits of info and tease people and then there's leaks Which could be fake or real and then put release dates and then miss them.

208
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:26,878
Scott: and it's like fuck it.

209
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:33,440
Scott: either be a hundred percent Open and tell your your your audience everything or tell them fucking nothing and then surprise them.

210
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,266
Scott: Those are your two choices that are good.

211
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:39,583
Scott: if you do the in-between thing that most people do you're doing it wrong in the opinion of sky.

212
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:54,216
Rym: so in a brief aside because it's not really like animation or anime related other than very tangentially because a big part of anime fan culture is conventions and twitchcon happened and twitchcon is is it's weird?

213
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:54,637
Scott: right cuz?

214
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:59,980
Scott: twitch is Almost entirely a gaming thing, but it's pushing into like all these other avenues.

215
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:06,285
Scott: And they have like this, you know Digimon Pokemon they got all these anime Marathons on there.

216
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:10,700
Scott: They're like crunchy little partnerships on there and there's tons of weebs and all the Chad.

217
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,110
Rym: So I always ignore twitchcon cuz I don't care and like that.

218
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:17,180
Rym: but I so it made the news and I actually paid attention to it.

219
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,124
Scott: I watch twitch.

220
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:25,499
Rym: twitchcon is bad as much as we Like we make fun of how a lot of anime comes are really really badly run.

221
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:33,678
Rym: Anime con people have a great amount of convention privilege compared to almost every other kind of convention like.

222
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:41,660
Scott: well because Gaming cons right developed to a certain point and then didn't progress except packs packs and magfests.

223
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,921
Rym: They're like the only gaming cons that are progressed Right.

224
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:50,180
Scott: the almost gaming cons just stayed and kept doing their tiny thing and didn't try to become didn't try to grow.

225
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:51,605
Scott: They just stayed where they were at.

226
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:54,778
Rym: but packs and magfest are sets of conventions.

227
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:55,340
Rym: where?

228
00:12:56,243 --> 00:13:01,771
Rym: as they grew they Did the things necessary to allow that growth to happen.

229
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:09,135
Scott: anyway anime cons have been around a long time You know perhaps longer as long as they grew, but did not change.

230
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:10,540
Rym: and then a few of them change, right?

231
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,080
Scott: Well, they tried to grow many of them right and they learned and developed to some extent.

232
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:16,726
Scott: Did is some didn't?

233
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:19,460
Rym: that's by kicking us off the staff or telling them to mail the badges.

234
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:22,919
Rym: They eventually started mailing the badges because this is objectively the right thing to do.

235
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:25,088
Scott: The point is they developed over time.

236
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,800
Scott: they tried to grow they learned lessons.

237
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:33,320
Scott: They've had many years to get shit right, but you know conventions like twitchcon.

238
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:42,867
Rym: So twitchcon the reason it was in the news is that no one could get in because of quote unquote unprecedented crowds which again How are conventions messing this up?

239
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:46,800
Rym: packs has a number of people who can attend and it's sold out and that's it.

240
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:49,333
Rym: No one's gonna show up and think they can get in.

241
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:53,309
Scott: yet twitchcon seems Like online registration with mailed badges.

242
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:55,799
Rym: no, so a million people showed up and couldn't get in.

243
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:09,800
Rym: Like basically there because of a combination of Security theater and poor planning so many people couldn't get in that it was one of those convention disaster stories.

244
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:16,886
Rym: They ended up like extending the hours of the con to like let people who couldn't get in or what would happen during those Extra hours.

245
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:18,600
Scott: Did you add did you invent more content?

246
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:22,200
Rym: No, which I don't understand because there's not a lot of content at twitchcon.

247
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,245
Scott: No, that's the thing is like.

248
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:29,921
Scott: no matter how much I like twitch and I actually watch twitch more and more there's Like.

249
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,089
Scott: I can't imagine what I would do at twitchcon.

250
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:40,639
Scott: go to my someone that I watch on twitch that go see them sit on a panel and Just answer question.

251
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,202
Rym: So I'm one.

252
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:44,112
Rym: and it's funny because they actually have more than I expected in some avenues.

253
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,764
Rym: like they have this little artist alley and they Have like.

254
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:47,871
Scott: I guess there is an art.

255
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:53,260
Rym: There are a lot of art streams Yeah, and there's like a little tabletop area and there's a little cosplay contest.

256
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,283
Scott: There is tabletop.

257
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:56,571
Rym: you is like an area set up.

258
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:59,220
Scott: They could do some RPG acquisitions ink stuff.

259
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,204
Scott: That's that's too extreme.

260
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:02,897
Rym: Yeah, but they have like gaming and arcades and stuff, but they're all kind of small.

261
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:07,560
Rym: but the problem is There's not a lot of like actual other content like their panels.

262
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,657
Rym: There aren't that many and almost all of them are like meet and greet like just a meet and greet.

263
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:16,398
Scott: the one thing that was Happening sort of at with adjacent to twitchcon was the mini GDQ.

264
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,613
Scott: Yeah, actually quite excellent to express and that's most.

265
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:28,660
Scott: I was surprised how small the donation count went You know, even though people were watching it, but it was excellent.

266
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:36,980
Scott: But apparently the problem wasn't just like a distilled like it was like all the best parts of a full GDQ Without the slow part.

267
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,000
Scott: So it's like it was like you wanted to watch the whole thing because every single event on the tiny GDQ is great.

268
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:49,808
Rym: So there were huge lines to get in and people couldn't get in and there were huge lines to do Anything at the cons.

269
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:51,499
Rym: even if you got in you couldn't do anything.

270
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,244
Rym: yeah, and there's all sorts of drama.

271
00:15:53,344 --> 00:16:03,354
Rym: and what's amazing is this isn't like like anime cons even when they're big often don't have a Lot of money or expertise, but twitch is a real company.

272
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:04,257
Scott: You mean Amazon?

273
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,199
Scott: Yeah Amazon is a real company.

274
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:11,913
Scott: Amazon is a real company headed by the wealthiest person to ever live.

275
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:17,147
Rym: There are people who know Professionally how to run events.

276
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,973
Rym: They're perhaps called event managers.

277
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:19,635
Scott: They have.

278
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:21,200
Scott: Amazon runs many events.

279
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,540
Scott: There are like all kinds of professional conferences.

280
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:38,440
Rym: How is twitchcon such this like goddamn amateur hour like the problem of too many people show up and you can't let them in Coupled with As no one who works for twitch ever been to any other conference or convention ever.

281
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:52,286
Rym: Yep, and what's worse is all the press about it like Attendees of these comms you don't go to like PAX's or magfest or the few good anime cons Like they expect and accept this bullshit Which is amazing to me.

282
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:58,491
Rym: like all the people used to go to Otakon and wait four hours on Thursday to get their badges And couldn't even dream that there was a better way to do it.

283
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:03,209
Rym: like most people do not have imagination So the craziest things are.

284
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:06,380
Rym: a lot of the press say things like I'm gonna quote this article.

285
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,544
Rym: I'm gonna link to Every convention.

286
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:13,017
Rym: tickly typically features long lines as fans are supposed to wait in security cues before entering.

287
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:15,175
Scott: that is no no That's not true at all.

288
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:22,078
Rym: One packs has that problem and they've actually really fought the city of Boston to not make it a problem.

289
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:25,900
Scott: and also There's only lines if you want to do stupid shit.

290
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,045
Scott: If you don't do stupid or you

291
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:36,799
Rym: want to do like them like the biggest things that usually isn't that much of a line because They're in giant theaters and the things that tend to fill up where you would have to wait in a long line Tend to be things that are in pretty small rooms.

292
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:41,037
Rym: But there's room for people to do things and there's enough content to try to spread that.

293
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:42,966
Rym: load out It just.

294
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:51,720
Rym: it bothers me How baby's first mistake happens at a con like twitch con and San Diego comic-con only has mega lines for like there.

295
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:52,724
Scott: They're infamous.

296
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,291
Scott: what Hall D or whatever?

297
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,115
Scott: whatever college?

298
00:17:55,376 --> 00:18:02,440
Scott: they don't clear the room Which is that's people just constantly waiting to get in the room and that would they let one person comes out.

299
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:04,370
Scott: That's what I've heard in years past.

300
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,440
Scott: I don't know if they've never been to San Diego comic-con.

301
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:08,479
Scott: I never will go so I don't know what it is like now.

302
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:14,023
Scott: Someone can correct me if they've know better, but that's the story I heard a few years ago, and I have not heard that it is Jane.

303
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:22,475
Rym: Yep, but anyway things Of the day.

304
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:34,283
Rym: so because it is the anniversary of GeekNights since we started on October 31st One of the things today, I'm gonna link to is the first episode of GeekNights.

305
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:35,448
Rym: That is public.

306
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,940
Rym: great I'm not linking to the beta episodes.

307
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,810
Rym: those are buried behind the patreon wall.

308
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:46,465
Rym: But I'm gonna link to the first episode of GeekNights And you will be shocked and disappointed if you click on that link.

309
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,770
Scott: do not listen to that.

310
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,629
Scott: I mean you already shouldn't be listening or watching this right now.

311
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,709
Scott: Yes, you should, but if you are you really shouldn't be listening to that.

312
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:01,022
Scott: What is this do I invite as an experience?

313
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:05,902
Scott: like Scott 13 years ago is not the same person You know what's funny is a bad person.

314
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:10,021
Rym: Scott 13 years ago Talks a lot about politics.

315
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:16,910
Rym: It's a bad person 13 year olds I guess you like you were convinced that Rumsfeld was gonna get a war crimes trial.

316
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,256
Rym: Should President he will?

317
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:22,369
Scott: yeah, so will a lot of other people.

318
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,957
Rym: But anyway my real thing today, I think are good.

319
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:28,427
Rym: my real thing of the day to segue from politics is a 538 article.

320
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:35,090
Rym: That's very important, so it is the ultimate Halloween candy power ranking.

321
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:37,105
Scott: How do I judge the power based on sugar?

322
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,740
Rym: No, so what they did?

323
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,649
Scott: all our per ounce.

324
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:48,899
Rym: They basically did an experiment where they pitted different candies against other candies in a. here are to Pick the superior one type contest.

325
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,710
Scott: and they did this to a whole bunch of people to figure out which guns were the most.

326
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,378
Rym: 5,371 unique IP addresses.

327
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:56,504
Scott: and so neko wafer has low power.

328
00:19:56,845 --> 00:20:00,457
Rym: so the whole rating is here and We have the full order.

329
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:03,230
Rym: so number one is the Reese's peanut butter cup.

330
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:08,810
Scott: I was gonna that was one of my guesses for a very valuable one 84 percent of all its mashups.

331
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:10,717
Scott: Oh, cuz I mean it's so good.

332
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:13,426
Rym: I mean oh look candy is garbage.

333
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:14,209
Rym: I'm an adult.

334
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:17,601
Scott: I really a Reese's peanut butter cup is a good candy.

335
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,126
Rym: number two is Reese's minis.

336
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,353
Scott: Oh Just the small peanut.

337
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:23,139
Scott: yeah, they really broke it down right.

338
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:23,821
Scott: 81 percent 81.9.

339
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:24,623
Rym: Reese's miniatures, okay?

340
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,999
Scott: There's basically the same fucking.

341
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:31,839
Rym: so number three is Twix Which is disgusting disgusting garbage trash.

342
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,750
Rym: when I was at home caveat when I was in middle school I did like four Twix bars a day sir poison.

343
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,754
Scott: I could never eat one even no matter even no matter how young I was and addicted to sugar I was.

344
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:43,390
Scott: Twix never tasted good.

345
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:46,260
Rym: So then Kit Kat Snickers Reese's Milky Way.

346
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:54,745
Scott: Reese's stuff with pieces peanut butter seems like so Basically any of the full-on chocolate candies are powerful.

347
00:20:54,966 --> 00:21:06,114
Rym: No, it's specifically chocolatey candies mostly adjacent to peanut butter Really good Reese's is one two three four five Dents right it's.

348
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:07,800
Scott: yeah, you know you get a Snickers right?

349
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:08,021
Scott: It's like.

350
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:15,310
Scott: I got some fucking caramel some peanut in there It's but but but Milky Way is number seven the least dense candy bar, Milky Way is very dense.

351
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,384
Rym: Musketeers musketeer is the non-dense three musketeers is number 12 there.

352
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,110
Scott: I mean it's still really fucking good.

353
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,546
Scott: Yeah, I used to buy used to buy three musketeer on purpose.

354
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:26,771
Scott: so grocery checkout I'll.

355
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:27,354
Rym: I like to.

356
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:27,997
Rym: I do like like.

357
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:29,946
Rym: Twix is okay, but butterfinger.

358
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:37,379
Rym: you Reminds in Twix that biting into a butterfinger Reminds me of the fucking my imagine.

359
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:40,150
Scott: I never understood my Bart Simpson like this because they're so nasty.

360
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:42,962
Rym: They taste like bile.

361
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:44,270
Rym: that is what I would describe.

362
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:44,711
Scott: I think it's.

363
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,818
Scott: I think what it is is that there's real this.

364
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:48,464
Scott: there's levels of peanut butter right.

365
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:51,659
Scott: the top level is obviously Oh Natural peanut butter.

366
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,330
Rym: just eat it out of the bowl.

367
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:54,454
Rym: They make it that.

368
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:59,050
Scott: they make it the deli counter bike with some fucking peanuts and a roaster right behind in the grocery.

369
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,357
Scott: That's the best you can get it.

370
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,570
Scott: like Publix in Florida one of the only good things in Florida.

371
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:05,056
Scott: That's like the top quality.

372
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:08,972
Scott: like farmers market peanut butter is the top level right where the oil Separates.

373
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:19,755
Scott: the second level is like grocery store real peanut butter like Skippy or whatever peanut fitter panner You know like it's real peanut butter, but it's you know it's factory peanut butter Not real peanut butter.

374
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:28,670
Scott: and then the next level is the Reese's peanut butter Which you can tell obviously tastes like fake peanut butter, but is still palatable and good, and it's sugary.

375
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:29,929
Scott: So your body likes to eat it.

376
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:40,483
Scott: Yeah, any peanut butter below that such as whatever the fuck is in Twix and butterfinger and other garbage I wouldn't doesn't taste like peanut butter and is inedible, so here's here's something.

377
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:41,787
Rym: What do you think is at the bottom here?

378
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:42,730
Scott: Oh?

379
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:50,502
Scott: Neko wafer no the bottom See is those weird those hard old lady thing good and plenty.

380
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:51,364
Scott: Yeah, that's bad.

381
00:22:51,424 --> 00:22:52,307
Rym: Those are disgusting.

382
00:22:52,347 --> 00:22:53,650
Rym: yeah, Boston baked beans.

383
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,795
Scott: I don't know what the fuck that is.

384
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:55,538
Rym: chiclets.

385
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:56,040
Scott: Oh you mean?

386
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,130
Scott: do they mean actual baked beans?

387
00:22:58,491 --> 00:22:59,736
Rym: I imagine there's some candy.

388
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:03,570
Scott: chiclets are okay, but they're just like they're just gum that runs out in two seconds.

389
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:05,536
Scott: They're not bad, but it's like they're not.

390
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:07,682
Rym: Boston baked beans is a candy.

391
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:08,585
Scott: never heard of it.

392
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,330
Rym: It looks like rabbit poop.

393
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:13,026
Rym: Okay, okay, I guess that's so.

394
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:21,293
Rym: that's the thing Super bubble jaw buster show your daddy or like ginger sugar babies Etc.

395
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:23,482
Scott: all these hard things that old ladies the dots.

396
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:31,970
Rym: so anyway this article in proper 538 style goes through like a pretty detailed analysis of the results with data, and it's fascinating.

397
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:33,736
Rym: That is my Halloween thing of the day.

398
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:35,301
Scott: I have a non Halloween thing of the day.

399
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:51,110
Scott: so in the year 1987 or 88 When I was in kindergarten for the first time in my life I had access to a Personal computer the Apple - that was in the classroom and on it was shit like well flop.

400
00:23:51,191 --> 00:24:01,389
Scott: Well, there was nothing on it except for the OS Floppy disk next to it five and a quarter inch ones and some of them had Some member munchers or word munchers.

401
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:07,670
Scott: But some of them had turtle graphics slash logo, and that is where I programmed a computer for the first time.

402
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:12,821
Scott: someone who is a perhaps genius has created this web app.

403
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:16,913
Scott: you can just go to this turtle that audio in your browser and There it is.

404
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:18,865
Scott: it's turtle graphic slash logo.

405
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:19,710
Scott: it operates.

406
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:24,479
Scott: If you know how to operate turtle graphics or logo you know how to operate this Except if you just look at it.

407
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:26,068
Rym: You can operate this you do not.

408
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:27,354
Scott: well You also.

409
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:30,670
Scott: you can do vice versa also, but it is not used to make graphics.

410
00:24:31,132 --> 00:24:33,502
Scott: It is used to make audio much like a Mario Paint.

411
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:42,729
Scott: the line you draw controls the the frequency of the notes you are making and they sequence and then there is well, and then there's the.

412
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:52,962
Scott: you know you paint different colors onto your sequence to play different notes and There you go you have a music sequencer that you control via turtle graphics.

413
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,730
Scott: It's really slick for being something in a web browser.

414
00:24:56,632 --> 00:25:07,549
Scott: It's way good, and I think in the past We've I've had other things of the day that were basically musical tools in the browser like yeah We have a forum thread where people were making music.

415
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:11,450
Scott: There was one that was like a drum machine and one that was like a synthesizer.

416
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:17,330
Scott: So I think like I don't have the skills to do this, but I I'm sure someone else has done it already.

417
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:29,496
Scott: But it would be really cool if somebody went and like collected all these different web-based Synthesizing drum machine sequencing music making tools and Use them all together to make.

418
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:31,762
Scott: there's a Google doodle that was a music tool.

419
00:25:31,883 --> 00:25:37,621
Scott: once I do right combine them together Into a music rig to create an EDM song.

420
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,110
Rym: I guess the only trouble I have is that not to be EDM.

421
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,965
Rym: I could just be em having a an actual legit background in for real music and composition.

422
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:59,750
Rym: It is I find it like Especially hard and strange to use any of these things Because it is so much faster to just write out sheet music for me than to do any of this nonsense.

423
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:02,290
Scott: Yeah, no almost no musical tool.

424
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,000
Rym: That's or use like a real synthesizer like.

425
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,384
Rym: I can do that almost nothing.

426
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:14,490
Rym: that is well with a keyboard on it Or even without a keyboard like if it's just like a drum machine style like synthesizer or a ranger sequencer and synthesizer.

427
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,110
Scott: I have several iOS apps that are like, you know full-on.

428
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:24,850
Scott: You could make like crazy music with them and people do and I just can't even figure out what the fuck to do with them.

429
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,572
Scott: I have that had more success with Korg on the DS than with any of these iOS things I'm gonna.

430
00:26:29,592 --> 00:26:32,543
Rym: yes at least acts like real stuff like.

431
00:26:32,603 --> 00:26:35,614
Scott: I know how to use but the user interface of it You can figure it out.

432
00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:39,166
Scott: Even if you are clueless if you're just competent to a degree.

433
00:26:39,186 --> 00:26:40,450
Scott: Yeah, but like what is what is this app?

434
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,596
Scott: I have my iPad here.

435
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:42,360
Scott: What is this thing?

436
00:26:42,582 --> 00:26:45,214
Rym: Yeah, you know what app I would use that Maker 3.

437
00:26:45,214 --> 00:26:47,009
Scott: so I beat maker 3 on my iPad.

438
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,070
Scott: I think it was like free or like on super sale for like 50 cents or something at one point.

439
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:54,689
Scott: So I just got it and I don't think it's free all the time.

440
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:58,385
Scott: But it's like you open this up and it's like you can tell.

441
00:26:58,425 --> 00:26:59,650
Scott: this is a serious app.

442
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,312
Scott: It's not like.

443
00:27:00,874 --> 00:27:03,381
Scott: it's not like reason but it's like a level below that.

444
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:04,083
Scott: Yeah, it's still.

445
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:06,290
Scott: you could make real music with this.

446
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,416
Rym: So will you listen to it?

447
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:09,788
Scott: I can't even figure out how to make it be like, you know?

448
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:16,200
Scott: Okay The UI is just such a mess of craziness.

449
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:19,830
Rym: granted the last time I was actually composing music I need a tutorial or something.

450
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:25,110
Rym: I was I was using a for a long time like up until when I just kind of stopped doing that stuff.

451
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:31,632
Rym: I had a pirated copy of cakewalk studio and I had a pirated copy of Cool edit 2000.

452
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:39,353
Rym: Yeah, and though that was like my final Rym is actually making real music pipeline before that Ship kind of sailed.

453
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:44,110
Scott: Yeah, the one thing I always look at whenever like I think yeah, I should become a become a DJ.

454
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,034
Scott: It's like get though.

455
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:45,577
Scott: What's it called?

456
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:48,030
Scott: The starts of the a. what the hell's that thing?

457
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:55,450
Scott: Well the thing with the two the thing without the digital records You get to know you get the lot you get the pad with all this the touchy the square.

458
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,017
Rym: I don't like that thing at all.

459
00:27:57,037 --> 00:27:59,710
Scott: you get that and you connect it to what the hell's the set?

460
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:04,917
Rym: That thing feels like it's purely Performative and isn't that useful.

461
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:19,997
Rym: and it seems like the people who use it either use it to make a spectacle around it or our DJs or our people who don't have a classical education in music and are sort of naively deriving and making music using Simpler tools that don't come from the tradition of

462
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:23,729
Scott: sure, but those people live the life of a world hopping DJ.

463
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:27,699
Rym: Some of them do.

464
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,689
Rym: some of them are just like Jason in the good place.

465
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:32,589
Rym: What you haven't watched anyway them at a moment.

466
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:39,290
Rym: We've reviewed all the anime that came out and is coming out in the fall a while ago and it's on YouTube.

467
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:43,808
Rym: And the point is if you're new to GeekNights, we reviewed it all before we watched any of it.

468
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:47,882
Rym: So go watch some of this anime and tell us if we're right.

469
00:28:47,982 --> 00:28:48,585
Scott: Oh Ableton.

470
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:59,324
Rym: That's that In some other stuff coming up sooner than you think we are going to be at Pax unplugged doing not one but two events on Saturday.

471
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:00,690
Rym: learn and win Puerto Rico.

472
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,949
Rym: We're gonna teach everyone how to play this classic board game.

473
00:29:03,232 --> 00:29:04,729
Rym: They're going to teach everyone how to be good at it.

474
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,930
Scott: That was the number one game on board game geek for years before it was unseated.

475
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:15,930
Rym: It is still highly ranked, but you know, yeah But it is arguably one of the most elegantly designed euro like style board games ever.

476
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:19,062
Rym: yep, and there's a reason why it gets talked about to this day.

477
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:26,410
Rym: and we're also gonna be doing a Slightly more advanced version of the 40 tabletop games you must play because it's a tabletop con.

478
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:32,268
Rym: We can assume the audience knows some stuff about tabletop and if they don't that sucks for them.

479
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:32,870
Scott: Why are they there?

480
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,438
Rym: Why at Pax unplugged?

481
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,030
Rym: Did you not realize it was the unplugged packs?

482
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,769
Rym: That panel will also be streaming from Pax unplugged.

483
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:47,350
Rym: So yeah, if you're not a fax unplugged you can watch us do a panel live.

484
00:29:47,811 --> 00:29:53,330
Rym: So maybe like one of us will fall off the stage or something like stage on purpose push Rym off the stage.

485
00:29:55,832 --> 00:30:01,220
Scott: The book club book is a Space Odyssey 2001 a Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke.

486
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,127
Scott: We just did the the real Odyssey now.

487
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:03,950
Scott: We're doing the Space Odyssey.

488
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:09,432
Scott: I'm still reading fantasy novels because I'm a nerd but as soon as I finish them I'll read.

489
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:12,224
Scott: I'll probably be able to read 2001 a Space Odyssey very quickly.

490
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:20,964
Rym: Yep, so weirdly enough somehow Scott and I both watched our cartoon all the way to the end, right?

491
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:29,193
Scott: So I was on a tropical island and I don't know if you know this but on tiny tropical islands that don't have like major cities and commerce There are.

492
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:34,010
Scott: I don't know how many nerds are there but not a lot especially not in a district full of hotels and beaches.

493
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:40,770
Scott: and also There's not really anything to do at night unless you want to drink dance or go to a casino.

494
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:44,889
Scott: So at night I saw lots of people not just me.

495
00:30:45,612 --> 00:31:02,069
Scott: we were like we were walking back to the hotel after you know, lazing by the pool after dinner and We looked into people's rooms because their windows are open and they were all sitting around watching TV at like eight o'clock On a tropical island in a hotel where they were on vacation because what the fuck else are they gonna do?

496
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,534
Scott: so we went back to our room and Watch TV.

497
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:09,810
Scott: wife put out the iPad and the Wi-Fi totally worked.

498
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:14,190
Scott: So we watch we open up the Netflix and we're like, all right, watch the dragon thing.

499
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,077
Scott: It's all like nine episodes upstairs the deal.

500
00:31:16,097 --> 00:31:19,370
Rym: The Dragon Prince is a cartoon on Netflix.

501
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:21,400
Scott: It has a Netflix original.

502
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:23,150
Scott: You can only see it legally on Netflix.

503
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:32,309
Rym: It has a lot of people involved in it who were involved in Avatar the Last Airbender, which is an a-plus show and It's pretty good and there's only nine episodes in the first season.

504
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:35,502
Scott: So I wonder if it'll how many seasons it will go.

505
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:37,610
Scott: unlike other some Netflix shows they just go.

506
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:42,215
Rym: Well, I feel like it'll be a lot like they're obviously gonna have a second one Definitely like it's.

507
00:31:42,296 --> 00:31:55,410
Rym: following the same pattern as Avatar the Last Airbender and the plot at the like there is going to be probably a plot that concludes and Resolves everything that needs to be resolved over the course of five or so seasons.

508
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:07,333
Scott: that show is a. it is a computer animated show, but the computer animation is like most of the time I was watching on a High-resolution iPad.

509
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:13,150
Scott: Yeah a small screen and because of that I think I didn't notice a lot of rough edges.

510
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:14,976
Rym: So the ad is interesting.

511
00:32:15,036 --> 00:32:19,110
Rym: I noticed them occasionally but rarely it has a watching on a bigger TV.

512
00:32:19,531 --> 00:32:30,890
Rym: it's interesting because a lot of people are complaining about the animation and what I can basically say is that The animation is a little off-putting in the sense that the characters tend to strike pretty static poses.

513
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:38,919
Rym: I think Emily pointed out like once they strike a pose Like it's a thing so they're all kind of like And then they just stay in that pose.

514
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,450
Scott: There were some weird poses, but there are also some amazing facial expressions.

515
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,567
Rym: Oh, yeah, so the character the girl wizard.

516
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,255
Rym: Oh, yeah She oh god already forgot her name.

517
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:52,338
Rym: it is his name.

518
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:56,730
Rym: I pulled up the I know no character's name Claudia Claudia.

519
00:32:56,971 --> 00:32:59,060
Rym: Okay, she makes good faces.

520
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:01,089
Rym: the elf girl make Rayla makes good faces.

521
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,221
Rym: But the character designs are a plus.

522
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:10,014
Rym: like the art is great the animations The animation is it.

523
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:17,323
Rym: I'd say that at worst it's about as off-putting as the animation at a walk through But for different it's better.

524
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,190
Scott: It's way better than what?

525
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:19,912
Scott: Thing is like.

526
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:21,978
Scott: it's because it's CG, right?

527
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:23,923
Scott: It's like you don't really.

528
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:26,430
Scott: it's like you're always gonna pick on it for its imperfections.

529
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:32,679
Scott: Yeah, right when it's like a 3d CG I stop noticing and just really like the show.

530
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:42,419
Scott: and yeah, it's like I didn't you know, I didn't stand out it didn't Interfere with the show in any way and it's like yeah, okay you want to complain about this But it's like no one complain about Toy Story.

531
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:43,464
Scott: put this next to Toy Story.

532
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:44,430
Scott: Toy Story looked like garbage.

533
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:47,667
Scott: Yeah, right, even though you know cuz Toy Story's from the 90s.

534
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,178
Rym: Well, so what helps is like the characters are good.

535
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:53,370
Rym: The plots actually pretty good and more complex than I expected, right?

536
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:59,750
Rym: So the plot the characters motivations are all Not just one-dimensional which is interesting, right?

537
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:05,888
Scott: I think the thing is it's like There are a lot of shows that complain about because they have no characters I care about at all in this show.

538
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:10,730
Scott: Some characters that are way awesome that sort of hold the show and the some characters that are me.

539
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:13,908
Rym: I think I like almost all the characters who have speaking lines.

540
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,335
Rym: I think that you like.

541
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:21,489
Scott: so I don't know spoilers, but so the main dude don't like him.

542
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:24,219
Scott: He's just a boring annoying dude.

543
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,556
Rym: his voice acting is really good and he's clearly Is like it's.

544
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:33,589
Scott: it doesn't sound like Shaggy from Scooby Doo, but he's sort of like that same sort of like.

545
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:39,898
Rym: No, that's the same voice actor who played Sokka who's one of the main characters in Avatar The Last Airbender Whatever is.

546
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,106
Scott: he's annoying dude.

547
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:45,553
Scott: I want to smack Best character in.

548
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:48,201
Scott: the whole show does not talk because they're deaf.

549
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:50,708
Rym: Oh my god the commander.

550
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:51,270
Rym: What's-her-name?

551
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,713
Scott: General Amaya.

552
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:53,775
Scott: Yeah, the aunt.

553
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:56,043
Scott: The aunt of the princess.

554
00:34:56,123 --> 00:34:58,110
Scott: It's like the kings like the Kings.

555
00:34:58,452 --> 00:34:58,874
Scott: No, it's the.

556
00:34:58,955 --> 00:34:59,920
Scott: it's the Queen's sister.

557
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:01,650
Scott: It's the Kings sister-in-law.

558
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:06,490
Rym: It's worth noting that this show has a very good and broad set of representation.

559
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,665
Scott: I feel like what they must have done is just been like, okay, we gotta we want to.

560
00:35:10,705 --> 00:35:11,990
Scott: we want to be cool and modern.

561
00:35:12,253 --> 00:35:13,730
Scott: Let's make sure everyone's represented.

562
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,530
Scott: So it's like who can we represent?

563
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:23,224
Scott: Blind people deaf people disabled people diseased people black people white people Color of people every gender of people.

564
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:24,090
Scott: Let's get them all in there.

565
00:35:24,632 --> 00:35:30,873
Rym: I like they like they're consistent and stuff like the fact that the moon elves all just have like vaguely Scottish accents Like.

566
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:31,598
Rym: I like that.

567
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:36,811
Scott: Yeah, that was strange Was like wait, why are the elves got it, but that's just how they are Like.

568
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:37,876
Rym: I like how they just did.

569
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:41,050
Scott: that is I bet you know, we haven't seen a map of this land.

570
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,574
Scott: Are they gonna?

571
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:43,790
Scott: is it gonna be Great Britain and the elves live in the north?

572
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:46,377
Rym: We've seen a really high-level map.

573
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:49,490
Rym: on the right side of the island there's elves and magic.

574
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:50,092
Rym: Is it?

575
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:53,165
Scott: the UK turned right to the right and supposedly everything's great.

576
00:35:53,326 --> 00:35:54,290
Scott: is the East actually the norm?

577
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:59,903
Rym: but I wonder if it's great in the same sense that the White Tower in Wheel of Time is great.

578
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:13,672
Scott: and then when you get there Oh, I see is the basic plot is a generic fantasy plot where there's elves in a magical land in the East And there's a human land in the outside because in the ancient times there was a war and they divided Human.

579
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,078
Rym: and then there's there's normal magic.

580
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:18,190
Rym: humans find shitty evil magic that they shouldn't be touching.

581
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,730
Scott: So there's all these good kinds of magic, you know that are all elemental magics.

582
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,501
Scott: But there's also evil magic that some humans did.

583
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:29,014
Rym: elves won't do it very like Wheel of Time Like that's the magic you weren't supposed to touch.

584
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:32,260
Scott: you get the idea for this intro that they give you in like the first minute.

585
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:39,789
Scott: Humans are bad elves are good But then the show entirely focuses on humans and most of the humans they show you were totally good Except for the evil one.

586
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:48,909
Rym: So I suspect not to give you spoilers But a lot of the humans who were introduced as good are going to become and be legit evil And I don't even know if they'll all get redemption arcs.

587
00:36:49,714 --> 00:36:55,420
Scott: I think the only one who's evil is the number one evil guy and even his I think even his evil kids are not evil.

588
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,444
Rym: I mean, I'm not gonna lie.

589
00:36:56,524 --> 00:37:03,887
Rym: I think Claudia in particular The wizard girl who's the I think she is going to choose the evil magic.

590
00:37:03,907 --> 00:37:04,970
Rym: That's a big part of her life.

591
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:09,590
Scott: I think she's going to choose the evil magic, but I don't think she's going to do evil things.

592
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,375
Rym: I think she is I think she person.

593
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:13,923
Rym: I think she's gonna end up doing evil things.

594
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:23,333
Scott: because above all the thing with this show Is that despite being like an excellent show for children because like it goes it is a kid show It's aimed at kids.

595
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:24,340
Scott: It is a kid show.

596
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:34,742
Scott: and because it is a kid show Even though it's like ah This is great for children because it is deeper than other garbage kids shows and still entertaining for an adult It is still 100% predictable.

597
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:44,330
Scott: I was basically as you're watching I said This is this and as soon as I said anything it immediately happened and I had never seen it before.

598
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:52,850
Rym: Yeah of course Avatar was a little bit like that too in its first season and then every season it got more complex and more nuanced and started.

599
00:37:52,930 --> 00:38:00,270
Scott: Take like for example, this is not a spoiler because it is at no point Confirmed to be the truth in the first season at any point.

600
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:03,409
Scott: So it can't be a spoiler if it's just a prediction by me.

601
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,050
Rym: But your prediction might be based on things you saw later in the season.

602
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:17,850
Scott: I predicted this within like the as soon as the snake appeared in the first episode Right, which was like 10 minutes into the show that the king would be swapped into the birds body.

603
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:22,930
Rym: I was yeah 100% and I will bet my entire fortune lingers on this shot of the bird.

604
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:26,850
Scott: I will bet my entire fortune that the king has been swapped into the body of the bird.

605
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:31,090
Scott: Figured that out as soon as they said we they basically like we have a snake.

606
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:32,314
Scott: It has two heads.

607
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:38,015
Scott: if the two heads bite two things the souls of the two things will be swapped and there's a king standing There who's awesome, by the way.

608
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,798
Rym: Oh, yeah.

609
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:53,950
Rym: The king is both awesome and the hottest character in the show Yes, and he reminds me of the pirate from You because I felt similarly and the king has a pet definitely some sexual tension between him and the wizard guy.

610
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,850
Scott: Yes, the king has a pet bird who is also awesome.

611
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:03,906
Scott: Yeah And as soon as I saw the king of the pet bird and a two-headed snake that swapped souls between two beings I said the king will be soft with the bird.

612
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:15,137
Scott: and While it was never confirmed at any point in the first season I will bet every dollar that I in my possession that that is the case yep, and the show does not explicitly say it.

613
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,804
Scott: but oh and this does like.

614
00:39:17,965 --> 00:39:21,463
Scott: the money cannot be awarded to Anyone who writes for the show?

615
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:26,749
Scott: Yeah Could then in the second season find a way to write their way out of that money.

616
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:34,070
Rym: So the basic story is pretty good like it's a typical fantasy story.

617
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:40,580
Rym: but basically the humans got the evil magic and Then they decided to go invade the other side of the planet and be jerks.

618
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:43,950
Rym: and the dragons were like nope fucking stop it.

619
00:39:44,452 --> 00:39:45,495
Rym: I'm not letting this happen.

620
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:51,497
Rym: and they use the evil magic to kill the king of the dragons Yep, and his son.

621
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:52,942
Scott: Well, his son who's still in an egg.

622
00:39:53,284 --> 00:39:54,809
Rym: Yeah, they broke into dragon.

623
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,119
Rym: It's not the ass right king of the dragons.

624
00:39:57,401 --> 00:39:59,370
Rym: His prince son is dead.

625
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:05,923
Scott: So now that all those human princes now the elves want to get revenge So there's the badass king really like honestly the elven.

626
00:40:05,943 --> 00:40:10,459
Rym: justification for this assassination Pretty fucking justified right?

627
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:11,744
Scott: So the elves are coming.

628
00:40:11,764 --> 00:40:13,630
Scott: They're like, hey you killed the king of mood.

629
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:14,434
Rym: Oh, right.

630
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:17,130
Scott: You killed the king of the dragons and the egg his son.

631
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,250
Scott: So we're gonna come and kill the king.

632
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:24,252
Scott: We're gonna kill your king and kill the human king and his son and base symmetry Right.

633
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:26,419
Scott: So the show starts where there's the assassin.

634
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:27,342
Scott: moon elves are coming.

635
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:32,620
Scott: the humans find out that they're coming and they're like Well, I guess you're dead because we can't stop moon elves.

636
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:33,303
Scott: They're too strong.

637
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:34,930
Scott: Yep, and then the show goes from there.

638
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,535
Rym: Yeah, and not really.

639
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:41,350
Rym: It's the first episode like right away, but spoilers the egg wasn't actually smashed.

640
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:44,282
Rym: There's a dragon prince and that's good.

641
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:46,250
Rym: The whole show is gonna be about that.

642
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:52,049
Rym: They're trying to get the dragon prince's egg home to the dragon queen who is still alive, right?

643
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,450
Scott: Obviously the human kings vizier is the bad guy like Jafar.

644
00:40:56,657 --> 00:41:02,889
Scott: Yeah The only thing about him that I can say is because I mean really he thinks the vizier is the bad guy.

645
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:06,810
Scott: again The only thing about him that I can say one him and the king were definitely fucking.

646
00:41:06,957 --> 00:41:13,676
Scott: Oh, yeah But the only thing I can say about him is that I like how he actually can put on an act of being a good guy.

647
00:41:13,696 --> 00:41:24,270
Scott: sometimes Jafar who was always like Occasionally, he's like I am pretending to be good and I'm doing a good job of pretending to be good.

648
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:28,490
Rym: I'm always impressed when there's an evil character who lies convincingly in a show.

649
00:41:28,594 --> 00:41:35,408
Scott: Yes And that led to the best moment in the entire first season when the best character the general who cannot hear.

650
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:37,141
Rym: Oh my god She is so awesome.

651
00:41:37,303 --> 00:41:46,902
Scott: She says The she needs the evil guy is lying convincingly and she says bring me a stable boy I found a pile of bullshit.

652
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,208
Scott: Yeah, well, she signs it.

653
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:51,982
Scott: Yeah But I love that line was the funniest line.

654
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:53,910
Rym: That's the other thing I like about this show.

655
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:59,290
Rym: It is that there are funny times that in general like there are some stupid characters.

656
00:41:59,772 --> 00:42:15,245
Rym: But characters who aren't written to be stupid are Smart and figure stuff out that you as the viewer have also figured out and it skips a lot of those tropes That a show like this could follow of like everyone being fooled by the wizard like no every

657
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:15,546
Scott: almost

658
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:17,237
Rym: everyone is not fooled by the Wizard.

659
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:20,754
Scott: Yep But yeah, the show is Humorous.

660
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:22,421
Scott: it is good at the humors.

661
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:24,350
Rym: There's a lot of really funny bits.

662
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,597
Rym: There's some there's good like the drama is pretty good.

663
00:42:26,618 --> 00:42:30,310
Rym: The characters make plans and follow them for good reasons.

664
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:32,154
Rym: Yeah like I like this.

665
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:32,977
Scott: don't just don't.

666
00:42:33,057 --> 00:42:33,197
Scott: it's.

667
00:42:33,278 --> 00:42:41,750
Scott: the only thing you can't get from the show is unpredictability because if you are an Intelligent person who can see foreshadowing you will know everything that is going to happen.

668
00:42:42,032 --> 00:42:44,469
Scott: Well before it happens and then you will watch it happen.

669
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:51,088
Scott: Yep But you will still be entertained because the characters that are good will be entertaining and fun to watch.

670
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:53,877
Scott: you Care about them to some extent.

671
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:55,383
Scott: there'll be funny times.

672
00:42:55,684 --> 00:42:58,353
Scott: There will be some action scenes that are Right.

673
00:42:58,955 --> 00:42:59,558
Rym: Yeah, they they're.

674
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:01,585
Rym: they come and go they're like, they're mostly pretty good.

675
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:02,830
Rym: None of them are really bad.

676
00:43:03,472 --> 00:43:05,581
Rym: There's not a lot of monster of the week nonsense either.

677
00:43:05,621 --> 00:43:07,910
Rym: like it moves along for it's definitely not monster of the week.

678
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:11,690
Scott: It's definitely a quest kind of structure.

679
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:12,754
Rym: yep, right and it does.

680
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:20,036
Scott: every conflict that occurs has stakes that matter to the story which is a lot more like You know Galaxy Express kind of situation.

681
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,059
Scott: We got to get from here to there.

682
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,905
Rym: Yeah, so not not.

683
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:23,667
Scott: we got a.

684
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:33,276
Rym: you know We stay in one place and bad guys come also frankly hot elves How do humans dragon like the shows up my alley and I'm gonna watch the rest of it Definitely watch the second season.

685
00:43:33,316 --> 00:43:37,450
Scott: I mean, I'll probably end up watching it, but it's not like I'm gonna run to watch.

686
00:43:37,711 --> 00:43:41,746
Rym: I mean avatar is a like a a show like.

687
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:45,620
Rym: it's a great show But it's done and we've seen it all and it also.

688
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:48,130
Rym: not only was it good, but it got better with every season.

689
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:53,570
Rym: So the real test of the dragon France is if season 2 improves upon this base.

690
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:59,709
Rym: Because if it improves at the rate that avatar did the final seasons of the show are gonna be a plus.

691
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:04,868
Rym: Because avatar season 1 so it has a lot of the similar issues to what this show season 1 has.

692
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:06,977
Scott: I think it comes down to.

693
00:44:06,997 --> 00:44:08,583
Rym: you should watch avatar Scott.

694
00:44:08,643 --> 00:44:10,609
Rym: It is really really good Yeah.

695
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:16,990
Scott: So I think what this show its goodness level in the future is gonna come down to like how many seasons it has.

696
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:23,010
Rym: Right if I had to guess because that will deter because right now the six how many times how many kinds of magic are there?

697
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:27,570
Rym: There will be a number of seasons equal to the number of kinds of magic with a plus or minus one.

698
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,543
Rym: Cuz they final season might be the evil shitty human magic.

699
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,210
Scott: cuz the pacing of season one.

700
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:35,260
Scott: It was really good in terms of how things moved along.

701
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,845
Rym: avatars like that to avatar.

702
00:44:36,865 --> 00:44:39,274
Rym: just like stuff happens It's like moving.

703
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:43,390
Scott: you can only keep that pace up so long without reaching the elven land.

704
00:44:43,491 --> 00:44:51,910
Scott: And once you've reached the elven land I assume they're gonna bring the dragon egg all the less like in the wheel of time and like an escaflown a. it's a children's show.

705
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,360
Scott: They're going to succeed in their quest.

706
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,669
Scott: Yeah, bring it all the way there.

707
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,919
Scott: But I'm saying you can't have too much more content after that point.

708
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:58,120
Rym: cuz.

709
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,203
Rym: yes, you can cuz.

710
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:04,870
Rym: I am confident that there will be Drama in the elven lands that we have not seen yet.

711
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,054
Scott: That would make that.

712
00:45:06,115 --> 00:45:10,130
Rym: thinking about that makes me like there's probably like some elves that want to invade the human.

713
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:17,387
Scott: I want them to reach the elven land and then tada we have reached the climax Climax.

714
00:45:18,513 --> 00:45:19,358
Rym: Now the dragon princess.

715
00:45:19,378 --> 00:45:23,390
Rym: here the humans still have their shitty magic Some sort of resolution.

716
00:45:24,032 --> 00:45:28,666
Rym: Yeah, the end I mean the show will definitely resolve itself drags on then I will stop caring.

717
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:34,988
Rym: so I'll bet there be a number of seasons equal to the West your way to the elven land for a season or three more plus.

718
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,958
Rym: There's two ways to go if you got to keep a show moving.

719
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:44,055
Rym: Yeah, they're just end it good or like right away or You ask a flown a.

720
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:44,697
Scott: the other problem.

721
00:45:44,717 --> 00:45:48,589
Rym: Just keep escalating and escalating and eventually Isaac Newton shows up.

722
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:59,330
Scott: The other problem could be if they do to Netflix it ends too soon and they either a Russian ending which won't be good or Be cut it short and you don't get resolved and get to the elven land, which that would be some bullshit.

723
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,402
Rym: I think it's doing well enough to where it's gonna just continue.

724
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:02,804
Rym: Mm-hmm.

725
00:46:02,945 --> 00:46:03,226
Scott: We'll see.

726
00:46:03,406 --> 00:46:03,728
Rym: Let's see.

727
00:46:03,788 --> 00:46:04,210
Rym: release.

728
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:06,398
Rym: Season two is definitely confirmed.

729
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:08,307
Scott: The season two is a hundred percent confirmed.

730
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:08,669
Scott: They can't.

731
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:16,369
Scott: Maybe the look just if you watch season one, you know, they already made season two, but season three I think may be in question.

732
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:30,108
Rym: Yeah, I suspect it'll make it all the way to its end though Based on the popularity I've seen so far and the fact that the season is relatively short like nine episodes if you do six or so Seasons of about nine episodes each that's actually a pretty good number

733
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:30,470
Scott: of episodes.

734
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:32,018
Scott: This much in nine episodes.

735
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:33,766
Scott: we watched it in one sitting and it wasn't even.

736
00:46:33,786 --> 00:46:39,684
Scott: you know Late is that in three seasons you've got nine 1827.

737
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:41,790
Scott: That's one season of anime, right?

738
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,904
Scott: So that's why I think like wrapping it up in three seasons would be like way good.

739
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:50,079
Scott: if they wrapped it up even in less Than five that would be like super good.

740
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:52,367
Rym: cuz I'm pretty sure there's gonna be new like stakes.

741
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:53,290
Rym: We don't know about yet.

742
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,597
Scott: It'll be close to like the 48 episode area.

743
00:46:54,617 --> 00:46:59,322
Rym: Yeah 52 episodes seems like it's still like.

744
00:46:59,342 --> 00:47:00,609
Rym: that's my magic number of.

745
00:47:01,011 --> 00:47:02,901
Scott: It's getting a little long in a tooth at the 52.

746
00:47:02,901 --> 00:47:04,710
Rym: anything that goes beyond 52.

747
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,078
Rym: I'd better be really goddamn good.

748
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:10,228
Rym: reason for going longer than 52 like it better be fist in the North Star.

749
00:47:10,268 --> 00:47:15,209
Rym: Yeah Moon if you're gonna go that way, but yeah, this is death or Galaxy Express.

750
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:19,490
Rym: This is definitely worth watching a few episodes of to see if you like it.

751
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:25,870
Scott: I feel like if you got Netflix and you're saying I want to watch a thing that I haven't watched before.

752
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,636
Scott: This is nine episodes.

753
00:47:27,716 --> 00:47:28,519
Scott: You should choose this.

754
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,659
Scott: if you're me for anime nerd or someone who watches animation You should not buy Netflix to watch this.

755
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:38,770
Scott: You should not watch this if you don't like fantasy or animation.

756
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:50,870
Rym: Also, I get the only the only thing I'm disappointed in is that if we are right and the king is in the bird Then we lost the awesome hot king body and now he's just in the hot bird body instead.

757
00:47:51,173 --> 00:47:52,690
Rym: Well, they're like the king body is hotter.

758
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:56,265
Scott: There could be some sort of saving for that king body.

759
00:47:56,325 --> 00:48:00,630
Scott: that was not revealed But there was no foreshadowing of any way to save the king.

760
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:04,250
Rym: I worry we're never gonna get him back in his proper hot king body.

761
00:48:04,872 --> 00:48:09,269
Scott: I think you could just be saved by Fiat dragon magic by the end in the.

762
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:13,282
Rym: yeah Yeah, I just I wonder what the drug I think like up.

763
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:23,061
Rym: the big turning point in the show is gonna be either Some at like some elves that don't want the parents to be found because they want to start the war themselves with the humans.

764
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:29,059
Scott: or Well, it's like at the beginning of the show They're like, oh humans are using the bad magic they bad.

765
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:36,047
Scott: but then at the end once they get to the elven land It's gonna be like, oh look there's some bad elves, even though they're not using evil magic.

766
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:39,280
Rym: so far We've only met like one kind of elf the moon elf.

767
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:39,661
Scott: Yeah.

768
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:41,748
Scott: No, we met two kinds of elves.

769
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:43,174
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah, that's magical.

770
00:48:43,696 --> 00:48:50,546
Rym: I also did enjoy that like there's that side bit where the elf There's mustache guy and she like totally punks him.

771
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:54,559
Rym: I thought mustache I thought you would be cool and he's just a shithead.

772
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,526
Scott: Well, that's actually one thing I can say.

773
00:48:56,546 --> 00:48:58,741
Scott: the only prediction I made that was wrong.

774
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:05,429
Scott: Yeah was when Mustache guy appeared I said he's gonna join the party and then he didn't join the yep.

775
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:07,095
Rym: Not only did not join the party.

776
00:49:07,135 --> 00:49:08,019
Rym: I do think though.

777
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:13,335
Scott: He will reappear much like say Those guys in Star Wars who don't like you.

778
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:18,290
Rym: Yeah, I like how she didn't even steal his stupid sword.

779
00:49:18,772 --> 00:49:19,375
Scott: She didn't want this.

780
00:49:19,395 --> 00:49:19,917
Rym: She was just like.

781
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:20,881
Rym: I don't watch your sword.

782
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:21,665
Rym: What's wrong with you?

783
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:22,247
Rym: Never mind.

784
00:49:22,348 --> 00:49:22,629
Rym: Jeez.

785
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:30,950
Rym: So, uh, yeah, this is worth watching and is really good and at some point Maybe we'll do a spoiler episode, but we'll probably wait for another season to come out.

786
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:39,224
Rym: Yeah, we'll wait for at least after season two We'll probably do an episode where we'll talk about his guts cuz like it's not like there's.

787
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:46,705
Scott: no it's never a lot of metaphor going on in this guy, but I think the other The other big turning point I predict it's just an adventure.

788
00:49:46,726 --> 00:49:58,950
Rym: I foresee the dragon Queen Not doing what we expect Not having the same motivations is what we might expect and being a big monkey wrench in the overall plot.

789
00:49:59,778 --> 00:50:04,323
Rym: I think that I think The meeting of the dragon Queen is gonna be like a big moment.

790
00:50:04,343 --> 00:50:06,049
Rym: where the show swerves is my guess.

791
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,461
Rym: Hmm that's just like that's.

792
00:50:09,622 --> 00:50:10,710
Rym: that's pure speculation.

793
00:50:11,273 --> 00:50:15,050
Rym: I can't say that I have any specific thing that I'm pointing at for that.

794
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,718
Rym: I just think that's gonna be a big turning point.

795
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:20,475
Scott: She's not gonna be like, oh, thank you for bringing my egg I don't know.

796
00:50:20,616 --> 00:50:21,902
Rym: Maybe she wants revenge.

797
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:23,288
Rym: Anyway, maybe she's mad me.

798
00:50:23,328 --> 00:50:23,669
Rym: I don't know.

799
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:25,195
Rym: I don't know what her deals gonna be.

800
00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:25,275
Rym: Hmm.

801
00:50:26,038 --> 00:50:27,222
Rym: I feel like she's gonna have a deal.

802
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:29,650
Rym: That's not just I am now the dragon Queen.
