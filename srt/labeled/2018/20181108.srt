1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,341
Rym: It's Thursday November 8th 2018.

2
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:12,324
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,530
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:17,580
Rym: We were talking about the fan creator relationship.

5
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:26,056
Rym: Let's do this Like maybe all of you watching this stream live right now go away.

6
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:27,080
Rym: all two of you currently.

7
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:29,746
Scott: Sure, one of those isn't you?

8
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:33,159
Rym: yeah, yes, cuz it doesn't count you if you're on this page, huh?

9
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:43,040
Rym: If I went to the if I actually if I'm logged in as my account and I go to The actual like regular thing as opposed to the dashboard then it will count me, but it will not count me now anyway.

10
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:53,200
Rym: Yeah, I actually tested that once mm-hmm, so Interestingly enough you know it's not a Tuesday, so we're not gonna talk a lot about it.

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,096
Rym: But all I want to say is the Rangers are playing better than they play it all year.

12
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:01,547
Rym: It's for Three and a half games.

13
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,495
Rym: they have been actually playing like a real hockey team.

14
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:05,845
Rym: don't get too excited I am not excited.

15
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,773
Scott: There's a thing called regression to the mean.

16
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:15,732
Rym: yeah, there is it comes around eventually, but Well the interesting is that my problem in hockey is that I've expanded like.

17
00:01:15,873 --> 00:01:18,360
Rym: I'm a primarily Rangers fan because I live in Queens.

18
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:19,335
Rym: I live in New York.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,007
Scott: Loyalty is see.

20
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:22,731
Scott: if I was Rym.

21
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:26,164
Scott: I would have stuck with the Red Wings my whole life No matter how much Scott harassed me.

22
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:29,974
Rym: Yeah, but but number two still the Red Wings.

23
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:32,060
Rym: because of the history like my life.

24
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,970
Rym: No, I spent more than one team.

25
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,820
Scott: What the kind of bullshit is that it's like buying multiple lottery tickets.

26
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:42,822
Rym: I've increasingly learned that only New York sports fans freak out like that Uh-huh.

27
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:50,469
Rym: so uh they're my number two team and number three golden Knights because when the golden Knights do well No world suffers.

28
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,200
Scott: just pick up you start being fans.

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,549
Scott: I ever to be a fan of every team.

30
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:54,939
Scott: that way no matter who wins the cup you like.

31
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,032
Rym: yeah We won because you can't be a fan of the flyers.

32
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:00,884
Rym: You can't be a fan of the penguins Can't be?

33
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:01,530
Rym: there's a lot of teams.

34
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:04,164
Rym: You can't be a fan of But all that.

35
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:09,086
Rym: I was a fan of every team except to know I'm a fan of Two and a half teams.

36
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:13,866
Scott: It's more the limit is one per sport But that's the rule.

37
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,756
Scott: so the problem is one per league.

38
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:18,011
Rym: The Rangers.

39
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:33,842
Rym: we're doing Terribly this year because they're a bunch of kids, but thankfully my backup team is the Red Wings who are somehow doing worse Because the Rangers are just like rebuilding their team, but they're not really rebuilding like the fundamental way They play hockey.

40
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:39,725
Rym: meanwhile the Red Wings are actually completely rebuilding the entire system like the way They do lines.

41
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:42,360
Rym: the way they recruit like everything is completely different.

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:50,620
Scott: 2018 was a very bad year for all sports Mets bad Giants one in seven I think or the Giants one in seven.

43
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:52,059
Scott: I think they're real bad.

44
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,407
Rym: I got so desperate that Emily is a like.

45
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:55,310
Rym: Emily likes the lead.

46
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:58,340
Scott: I made the correct move of stopping watching football.

47
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:02,213
Scott: Yeah, after I checked the score of the first game.

48
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:04,663
Scott: Yeah without turning it on pretty much So.

49
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:14,691
Rym: it's been like three years since I've watched the football but something's changed because tomorrow is the first Red Wings Rangers game and Usually where the way that would go down is.

50
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:20,734
Rym: even though I'm primarily a Rangers fan I would instinctually cheer if the Red Wings scored cuz.

51
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:27,137
Rym: that's like how I grew up But I actually written for the Rangers over the Red Wings because you have no loyalty.

52
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:28,060
Scott: see this is great.

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,710
Scott: You've made this bumbling mistakes.

54
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:34,939
Scott: now no matter what you do I can harass you because you're either rooting for the opposite team from me.

55
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,760
Scott: Yeah, right in which case I could have the normal such a situation that most people have which is haha my team kicked your ass.

56
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:49,237
Scott: Or hopefully that the other thing right or You come in a room for the same team as me, but I'm like what the fuck you have?

57
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,727
Scott: no Kind of person.

58
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:52,419
Scott: are you just switching around you know?

59
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,604
Rym: You know what it's like.

60
00:03:53,705 --> 00:04:06,979
Rym: it's like when I first moved in New York and actually started watching the Rangers Everywhere else on earth like as I read like if we were up to Oh coming into the third period I was pretty confident We're gonna win And we usually would if we were up to Oh with five minutes to go.

61
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:12,526
Rym: Like sometimes we get in the car and leave the game because we had to get out of that parking lot And we were guaranteed to win.

62
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:19,736
Rym: and somehow when I came to New York Scott was like To oh with five minutes to go means we're about to lose with an empty netter.

63
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:22,917
Rym: That's right And I didn't believe it.

64
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,214
Rym: But now having watched the Rangers and the Mets for about a decade of living here

65
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:27,896
Scott: and the giant

66
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:39,304
Rym: I see and the Giants I see why Scott is the way he is Fucking God I feel like a Rangers to O lead is what every other team in the league would treat as a Four-o.

67
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:40,920
Scott: Lee have you heard about the miracle?

68
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:47,918
Scott: the miracle of the Meadowlands Miracle in the favor of New York, and there's more than one of them.

69
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:51,270
Rym: So yeah hockey hockey's happening.

70
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,234
Rym: I love hockey season.

71
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:53,540
Rym: so we got some news.

72
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,359
Rym: There's actually a bunch of news going on like bunch of stuff going down.

73
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:13,123
Rym: Yeah, first and foremost just to get out of the way if you weren't aware the election happened in the US and It was actually good news like the good guys picked up like 37 seats in one of the houses of our Congress or one of the chambers of our Congress the house Meaning.

74
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:16,459
Rym: I don't have to leave the United States because that was one of my red lines.

75
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:20,471
Rym: So now we got a whole bunch of bullshit going on like literally Dateline.

76
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,500
Rym: now as we're recording this show the u.s.

77
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,100
Rym: Is experiencing two different constitutional crises?

78
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:34,360
Rym: So business as usual Yeah, but it's it's starting to escalate rapidly like the thing that's going on now is a pretty big deal.

79
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,320
Rym: I'm curious to see what happens because it's entirely unrelated to voting all the matters.

80
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:53,917
Scott: Really is I even if we lost the you know the house and the the federal government I mean that would have been bad, but yeah the we got the New York State Senate Which is has yeah vastly more impact on my life than anything the federal government does.

81
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,860
Rym: so I wanted to take a side.

82
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:04,140
Rym: That's actually where I was leaning to you to talk about that because you can go to a Myriad of websites to learn more than any human needs to know about the national stuff.

83
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:18,718
Rym: But in New York State we basically had this coalition of fake Democrats that Colluded to prevent our state from doing anything good, and let's not talk about Felder is like that guy sim cos now sim cos nothing now.

84
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:19,120
Scott: He's yeah.

85
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,307
Scott: Well, he's in deep doo-doo.

86
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:22,057
Scott: you say pee in his pants right now.

87
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:28,980
Rym: basically This is a dude who in the modern era would be would basically win both the Democratic and the Republican primary.

88
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:29,766
Scott: He still did.

89
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:33,528
Scott: yeah, cuz he's a piece of shell He's still senator like in New York State.

90
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,420
Rym: the technical term for Simcha Felder is a piece of shit.

91
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:47,054
Scott: But the point is no matter what the federal government does the following things are likely to happen in New York State like next year as soon as the legislature gets back to business.

92
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:49,020
Scott: so number one have like bail reform.

93
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,597
Scott: We're gonna all those things people complain about like all your elections are run poorly.

94
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:54,500
Scott: They're gonna fix all that.

95
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,671
Scott: We're gonna bail reform early voting and automatic registration.

96
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:02,360
Scott: They're probably gonna legalize weed almost definitely gonna legalize the weed.

97
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:04,790
Rym: Basically, there's a chance like that.

98
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,627
Rym: like if you want to talk about things that they can do now There is a real chance.

99
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,378
Rym: like I'm not saying this is guaranteed tax the hell out of rich people.

100
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:11,880
Scott: There is a.

101
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:21,340
Rym: There is a legit chance New York State Cars in Manhattan single-payer health care within the state fix everybody's rent, so we can't get ripped off.

102
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:28,818
Scott: Yeah The state like this is a big deal because basically New York it could be is gonna be could be a paradise.

103
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:29,540
Scott: very quickly.

104
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:30,682
Rym: It's.

105
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:35,060
Rym: it's currently a race between New York and Massachusetts for making these kinds of reform.

106
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:42,709
Scott: Basically the entire New York State legislature wants all these things to happen and the only thing that stands in the way is the governor Who wants some.

107
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,779
Scott: he says he wants some of those things to happen?

108
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:52,198
Scott: but He may attempt to run for president in 2020 even though he says he won't and hopefully he won't win.

109
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:52,839
Scott: cuz fuck him.

110
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:59,126
Rym: Yeah, but if he leaves the list of white dudes who are gonna run for president and the Democrats He is the last no.

111
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,270
Rym: He's the second-to-last one.

112
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,672
Rym: I want cuz.

113
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:05,167
Rym: the last one I want is Bernie Sanders And your boss in there.

114
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:05,991
Scott: three boss in there.

115
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:07,499
Rym: Yeah, my boss will be in there.

116
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:09,628
Rym: Cory Booker is probably in there.

117
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:10,391
Scott: He's not so bad.

118
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,420
Scott: I'll take him over the three before dimension.

119
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:14,734
Rym: I wouldn't be shocked if Beto O'Rourke runs.

120
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:16,503
Scott: I'll take him over the four We've already mentioned.

121
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:18,532
Rym: Yeah, but we got good options.

122
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:20,119
Scott: like point is the worst options.

123
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,093
Scott: pretty good It could be we could have that governor out in two years and get someone better.

124
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:24,615
Rym: Yep.

125
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:28,169
Rym: That's why I voted Yes on number two in New York.

126
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,451
Scott: Yes.

127
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:28,672
Scott: Yes.

128
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:29,274
Scott: Yes one.

129
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:37,080
Rym: So because The only negative thing anyone could say about that proposition was it gives the mayor of New York too much power over a thing.

130
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:47,580
Scott: And I'm of the mind right now that there's a lot of people on all sides of the political spectrum Including up and down as well as left and right who for some reason really hate the mayor.

131
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:51,755
Scott: I don't understand it did like our mayor does some things that I guess you could do.

132
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:53,140
Scott: not perfect center-left.

133
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:56,368
Scott: He's not perfect But it's like you could do a lot worse.

134
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:59,460
Rym: plus most of the people who complain about him are mad.

135
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,294
Rym: I was against the police union, which I am also against.

136
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:08,439
Scott: I would quickly Much prefer our mayor to be the governor.

137
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:15,937
Rym: Ideal scenario our current mayor becomes the governor and we get someone away left of our mayor to become.

138
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:18,887
Scott: I don't think our mayor could Become the governor because there's two left.

139
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:24,206
Scott: Well, no because there's too many people who like I said, yeah Even on the left who hate the matter.

140
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:28,340
Rym: Yeah, and what not, you know, it's the trouble with the governor's upstate.

141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:37,099
Rym: But anyway big stuff happened in elections and New York State Might like rapidly You live sucks ass.

142
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:44,728
Scott: New York might be like the fucking best place to live like next year and you might be able to afford an apartment here Because of that.

143
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:54,280
Rym: Yeah, if they make some rent control action However, you probably won't be able to afford an apartment near us because the other news is that it is extremely likely.

144
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,300
Rym: Amazon's headquarters is going to be next to my apartment.

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,675
Scott: They're gonna split it but you know, first of all, this is just rumors.

146
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:03,920
Scott: Amazon hasn't said anything.

147
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:11,355
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty looking pretty likely But it's like I thought that those were likely locations when they first started this.

148
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,080
Scott: Yeah, so it makes perfect sense.

149
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,220
Rym: So, you know where like where it probably is.

150
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,682
Rym: So one there's.

151
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,937
Rym: they're gonna have two headquarters one in Crystal City and one in place.

152
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:20,820
Scott: that makes perfect sense.

153
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,784
Rym: Yeah, that actually does.

154
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:28,080
Rym: and one in New York City in Long Island City, which is the neighborhood I live in south of Astoria, which is where Scott lives.

155
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,944
Rym: They're right next to each other.

156
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,837
Scott: You'll probably be able to see the Amazon building out your window.

157
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:32,540
Scott: Not out your window.

158
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,772
Scott: They're facing an alley now, but yep out my window.

159
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:36,294
Scott: I could see it.

160
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,880
Scott: Yeah, even though much further away.

161
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,037
Rym: So, you know, they're probably gonna put it.

162
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:41,408
Rym: You know where that fancy park ends.

163
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:46,547
Rym: and then there's like an Apple Basin or whatever just down at the bottom Down at the bottom but at the at the.

164
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:53,136
Rym: so that giant that park goes from Brooklyn like the border of Brooklyn All the way north to right across the street from that blood bank.

165
00:10:53,437 --> 00:10:53,598
Scott: Mm-hmm.

166
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,566
Scott: So where Amanda works?

167
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:56,248
Rym: Yep, right there.

168
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,993
Rym: So then there's a little tiny canal where there's like kayaking and stuff Yeah, and then right across that canal is a big warehouse.

169
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,640
Scott: Well, that's what like the ferry dock is.

170
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,389
Rym: No, it's it's near there, but it's not right there.

171
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:10,220
Rym: Okay, this ferry dock is like way south of that at this point.

172
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:11,975
Rym: All right, you forget how big the park is.

173
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:14,680
Scott: Okay It feels like the ferry dock is at the north end of the park.

174
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,471
Rym: The park is like three times bigger than you were.

175
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,836
Scott: What was the last time you went to that park?

176
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,584
Scott: few weeks ago Maybe a month ago.

177
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:22,675
Rym: Did you see that giant ass part?

178
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:23,480
Rym: They built at the bottom?

179
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:24,164
Rym: There's two.

180
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:26,619
Scott: I didn't go to the bottom part at the top part where the ferry is.

181
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,884
Rym: There are two ferries in that park now - yeah Park is real big.

182
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:32,366
Rym: Yeah.

183
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:35,276
Rym: So anyway north of the Pepsi sign.

184
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:36,540
Scott: I think the ferry has two docks.

185
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,065
Rym: There are two docks in that park.

186
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:38,527
Rym: Uh-huh.

187
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:42,340
Rym: So well north of the Pepsi sign is the end of the park.

188
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:46,695
Rym: There's the basin that little canal and then there's a big warehouse and it's just bullshit.

189
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:47,819
Rym: They're gonna put it right there.

190
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:50,497
Scott: Mmm, what the good news for all the restaurants on that Street?

191
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:56,738
Scott: Yep So basically it's interesting because one John Brown better get like more meats before they run out at like 11 a.m.

192
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:58,504
Rym: so you can read like.

193
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:02,137
Rym: I'm not gonna get into every issue with this because it's way too like you.

194
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:05,939
Rym: we do a whole show on This and you can read real journalism about this.

195
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:08,300
Rym: But here are the things that stand out to me that are interesting.

196
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:21,119
Rym: One this neighborhood is already one of the fastest growing and most desirable neighborhoods in all of New York City Mm-hmm, and now they're gonna put like 20,000 new serious engineering and product jobs here.

197
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,717
Rym: That's that's a big deal.

198
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:41,403
Rym: but - it really goes against a long-running theme in America that conservatives and people who don't know better mostly push the idea that States like New York and say these like New York drive big companies away because of their very high taxes And what?

199
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,631
Scott: no it doesn't because they everyone gets.

200
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:50,940
Rym: all these companies get promised all these fucking tax breaks But even still they get fewer tax breaks coming here than they would go into like Bumble.

201
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,300
Scott: Well that just goes back to we were talking about two seconds ago.

202
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:54,823
Scott: Is that?

203
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:57,960
Scott: had we not turned over that New York State Senate?

204
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,540
Scott: They probably might have gotten some big-ass tax breaks.

205
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:08,293
Scott: But at least I know that my senator who is usually right on just about everything my state senator Everyone who represents me is already some statement.

206
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:12,752
Scott: Like we're gonna fucking tag Is like, you know, which may keep them from coming.

207
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:13,415
Scott: We'll see.

208
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:19,038
Scott: We'll see if they still come Even with a with a state legislature that may not give them all the breaks they want.

209
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:24,320
Scott: personally I think it should basically be unconstitutional to like without even amending the Constitution.

210
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:39,552
Scott: I'm not saying we should admit I think in Scott's interpretation of the US Constitution Which is you know questionable I think it's unconstitutional to give Tax breaks to pour to anyone because that's not equal protection.

211
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,080
Scott: The tax law should apply the same to anyone.

212
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:42,987
Scott: You can't write a law.

213
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:49,840
Scott: I don't think you feel to write a law that says Amazon pays less tax or Scott doesn't have to pay tax this year because that's not equal protection.

214
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:59,120
Rym: So Scott all I want to say and I don't want to get into it Is that that argument is the exact same argument that flat tax fuckers make?

215
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,561
Scott: What do you mean?

216
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:02,367
Rym: that everyone should pay the same percent?

217
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:02,648
Rym: You can't.

218
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,715
Scott: no no because that is saying.

219
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:11,640
Scott: because when you make a Progressive tax structure you're saying you're saying anyone who has this much money.

220
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,331
Scott: It applies equally to everyone who has that much money.

221
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:15,676
Scott: This is specific.

222
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:16,680
Scott: It's like Amazon.

223
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:28,181
Scott: if they wrote a law that said all Companies that are this big if they tried to be stupid and were like all companies that begin with the letter a and sell books Online.

224
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:28,923
Scott: no, no, no.

225
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:30,147
Scott: No, that's just bullshit.

226
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:34,379
Rym: That argument is the primary argument made by anti LGBT people.

227
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:44,100
Rym: How so the argument is that Marriage equality is not necessary because every man has the equal right to marry a woman it applies equally.

228
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:46,027
Scott: That's just semantic bullshittery.

229
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,892
Scott: and also protected class companies are not protected class anyway, the.

230
00:14:52,861 --> 00:15:14,588
Rym: I'm assuming that this is going to happen and I'm assuming that the tax breaks are less than they would be somewhere else, but Generally there's a big reason why the whole argument that companies will relocate to bumblefuck if bumblefuck like Hands over the lease to the land and gives them everything they want is that if you put the Amazon headquarters in bumblefuck It is literally impossible to hire anyone good.

231
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:15,350
Rym: Mm-hmm.

232
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:16,294
Rym: I have this app.

233
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:22,940
Rym: office has to hire like 20,000 extremely skilled engineers product managers, etc.

234
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:26,794
Scott: Well, most of those 20,000 are not going to be the highly skilled people.

235
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:28,500
Scott: They're gonna be any janitors.

236
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,131
Scott: You need security people.

237
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:31,500
Scott: You need maintenance people.

238
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,384
Rym: Contract all that out.

239
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:35,873
Scott: I'm just saying you need a lot of people besides the height.

240
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,780
Scott: There's not gonna be 20,000 programming jobs.

241
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,811
Rym: It's gonna be like 10,000 programming job some other thousand management jobs.

242
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,613
Rym: Five thousand.

243
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:44,759
Scott: Yes, ladies job something like some mix.

244
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:52,891
Rym: If you need to hire ten good engineers who have a lot of experience Yeah, there are ten good engineers in bumblefuck.

245
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:54,220
Scott: You're lucky if you have one computer guy.

246
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,165
Rym: There are like.

247
00:15:55,225 --> 00:16:00,992
Rym: it's hard to hire engineers in a small city like Seattle New York, they're all working at Amazon.

248
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:12,800
Rym: from the argument that Companies will move where the taxes are low and that high corporate taxes in New York drive companies away Seems to be pretty like solidly disproven by the fact that companies come to New York.

249
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:29,300
Rym: Anyway, and even startups come to New York and tiny companies and independent studios just lies and spread by corporations If you like say I need to hire Compositors editors video people and like someone who knows some like obscure bullshit, New York is a city.

250
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,819
Rym: Well, you'll probably have a hundred people applying to those jobs no matter how weird they are.

251
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:39,913
Rym: The other thing I have to say about this is thanks Satan I live in a rent stabilized building or I would have to leave.

252
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:41,160
Scott: Yeah, I'm rent stabilized.

253
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,545
Scott: They could the rent board.

254
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:48,792
Scott: it decides how much my rent goes up every year and every year people go there in protest and say Make the rent go down because they can.

255
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:51,809
Scott: they could say Rent down a hundred percent your rent.

256
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,034
Scott: everyone's rent has to be zero.

257
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:53,496
Scott: who's stable?

258
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:54,460
Scott: they could do whatever they want.

259
00:16:54,502 --> 00:17:05,740
Scott: Yeah It's just a board of people who decide and they listen to tenants and landlords yelling at them And then they pick a number and that's how it works and my rent moves exactly according to their dictate.

260
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:14,319
Rym: The other crazy thing about this is that the reasons that were cited free market be damned The reasons that were cited for Amazon going to Long Island City.

261
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:21,690
Rym: there was one in particular that really stood out and it basically said it's super close to Manhattan and has excellent subway access.

262
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,527
Scott: and all I want to say is that the train runs it does Thousands more people to it.

263
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:36,828
Rym: So the only subway that's actually there really is the seven tree is the seven train that is already today Running it literally two hundred percent capacity.

264
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:48,444
Scott: I get on the train when it's already completely full by Personally physically shoving people because it comes all the way from distant Queens where it's cheap to live Relatively cheap to live.

265
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:54,643
Rym: so every morning when I'm on the train slightly and I am - I am two subway stops away from where They're gonna put this office.

266
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:56,329
Rym: So I get on the train.

267
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,657
Rym: It's already like 99% full now.

268
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:01,085
Rym: It's literally Completely full.

269
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,480
Rym: there's no way for a single human being to get on it.

270
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:15,300
Scott: I don't think that will matter because if you're working in that office and you live in LIC Yeah, I'm not gonna take the trees gonna walk to work But some of the people they're gonna hire are gonna live in Brooklyn or Manhattan.

271
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:19,860
Scott: Why would you live in Brooklyn or Manhattan dude?

272
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,884
Scott: It is working out.

273
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:24,040
Rym: I see it is cheaper to live in northern Manhattan than to live here.

274
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,799
Rym: Well, very by a lot very no, but then not as far northern as you think.

275
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,287
Scott: But if you're in northern Manhattan The seven train is not the way to go.

276
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:42,456
Scott: and also you're taking the seven train in the reverse direction from that full train Dude, it's full in the reverse direction these days now too because a lot of people work here already jet blues I mean the seven train from Manhattan coming here is full in the morning.

277
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:53,311
Rym: Yeah There's a lot of people coming too long on the city in the morning that The only way to fix that train is to literally build more trains like more lines tunnels So or bridge then.

278
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:54,540
Rym: well you want to get into the details.

279
00:18:55,043 --> 00:19:00,780
Rym: We need more tunnels than just the Steinway tubes Which are basically cast-iron tubes that are over a hundred years old.

280
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:03,155
Scott: We can just tax Amazon and use the money to pay for it.

281
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:06,977
Rym: Yeah So in some other news, what do you got?

282
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:18,540
Scott: All right, so here's what this crazy thing happened, which I still don't fully Have a opinion on all the aspects of it because it's so complicated.

283
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,334
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's rare that I see a situation because it's so complicated.

284
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,096
Scott: It's fascinating.

285
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:24,060
Scott: So I have to talk about it.

286
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,915
Scott: Yeah is the deal is a game called Red Dead Redemption.

287
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:27,780
Scott: I know if you've heard of it.

288
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:33,880
Scott: It's basically Grand Theft Auto made by the Grand Theft Auto people but with a western skin like horses instead of cars.

289
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,638
Scott: yep, that's otherwise effectively the same exact fucking game.

290
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:42,255
Scott: and The what the second or third one third ones the new a new second ones.

291
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,940
Scott: a new one just came out.

292
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,607
Rym: It's - there's only been two.

293
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,315
Scott: Okay a new one just came out.

294
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,520
Scott: That's what matters.

295
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:53,780
Scott: It's as far as I can tell it's the same as the old one only new graphics new plot new whatever, right?

296
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,616
Scott: I haven't paid any attention because it's a garbage game.

297
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:57,200
Scott: I don't care about.

298
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:02,518
Scott: Anyway, so the old game the first edition had some stuff in it.

299
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,569
Scott: That was Unseemly like because it's this open-world.

300
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:08,220
Scott: do whatever you want game that's made by the GTA people.

301
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,836
Scott: You could do stuff like tie up a woman and throw around railroad tracks to get run over by a train.

302
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:18,694
Scott: and the old one And the new one has other sort of unseemly things you can do.

303
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:24,419
Scott: apparently one of those things includes Just taking NPCs to like go be eaten by alligators.

304
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:36,236
Rym: No I mean like there's a dude who made a long video in Zelda Breath of the Wild or he picked up a chicken Cuckoo and Like walked all the way to death mountain to throw it into lava just to see what would happen.

305
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,370
Rym: like even in games They're pretty benign like people can do whatever they want.

306
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,314
Rym: It's not real.

307
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:52,773
Scott: Yeah, I mean, this is something You know, I don't have a specific memory, but I feel like when I was young I did things like this in games that had a lot of like, you know Especially video games that had a lot of flexibility to be creative.

308
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,480
Scott: Yeah, you would do creative things for you.

309
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,980
Scott: So the one example I thought of is definitely half-life 2 with the physics engine, right?

310
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,767
Scott: It's just yeah, not only did you play to beat the game, but you would also just like try to make wacky stuff happen Like what was Gary's mod, right?

311
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,593
Rym: It was like Deus Ex human revolution.

312
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:08,596
Rym: Like I try.

313
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:09,640
Rym: I played mostly pacifist.

314
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,015
Rym: I only killed people who deserved it like who I would personally kill.

315
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:19,252
Rym: but Every now and then like a couple times I just saved my game and I played.

316
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:24,639
Rym: I played the game of How long can I be a menace before the police actually deal with me?

317
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:34,359
Scott: In video games right that allow you to do a lot of crazy different things, you know How many of you nuked the town at least once in Fallout, right?

318
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,954
Scott: Doing creative things is part of the fun of the game.

319
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:39,080
Scott: It's part of the point of the game.

320
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,080
Scott: It's a long-standing tradition, right?

321
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:51,736
Scott: So this guy has a YouTube channel, and it seems that what he does mostly is, you know The somewhat immature childish thing that I did when I was young, but he's still doing it.

322
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:58,439
Scott: I don't know how old he is Killing people in like ridiculous and somewhat hilarious ways depending on how you look at it.

323
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:11,039
Scott: Yeah in video games you know he kills NPCs and wacky ways makes YouTube videos out of it and posts them on his YouTube and he gets a lot of views like hundreds of thousands of views because Apparently you get good at that if you do it a lot.

324
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:14,120
Scott: He's real creative and certain games.

325
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:14,581
Scott: It's

326
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:20,400
Rym: not really fundamentally different from the people who make those crazy flying machines out of various pieces of metal and ships in Breath of

327
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:30,220
Scott: Right, it's just that visually what he's doing is murder as opposed to making a flying machine But it's still the same effective activity because all digital you're not really killing anyone, right?

328
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:40,099
Scott: Is experimenting and doing a creative and visually interesting to some people thing Inside the context of playing a video game.

329
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:48,029
Scott: However, one is one of his latest videos in particular In father's new Red Dead Redemption game.

330
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:59,991
Scott: in the game since it's like late 1800s Western time There is a old lady suffragette in the game as an NPC and she's yelling, you know Yeah, she let ladies vote and she's right.

331
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:05,976
Scott: But at that time ladies couldn't vote And apparently he was trying to shop in the shop.

332
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:06,659
Scott: This is what he says.

333
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:15,339
Scott: He's trying to shop in the shop and this lady was really annoying which I could believe an NPC yelling would be You know annoying in a video game.

334
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:29,874
Scott: so he took her out to be eaten by the alligator and made a YouTube video out of it out of it and You could see how that's different from sort of hilariously killing a generic bad guy right?

335
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:30,275
Scott: is that?

336
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:32,040
Scott: now it's like a specific person.

337
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:33,806
Scott: There's also something to be said for.

338
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:37,460
Scott: why did the people who made this video game made the suffragette so annoying?

339
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:39,420
Scott: Yeah, what are they thinking Rockstar?

340
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:40,673
Rym: This is the thing.

341
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:41,259
Rym: there's a lot.

342
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,706
Rym: There's a lot going on here.

343
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:56,860
Rym: There's a lot of situations like this where in another context It would be default benign unless there were evidence to the contrary, but in the video game industry It's basically default malevolent unless there's evidence to the contrary.

344
00:23:57,161 --> 00:23:59,367
Rym: So it's like three is Rockstar?

345
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:06,289
Scott: put a character in the game made them annoying and allowed you to Feed them to an alligator and murder them in other hilarious ways.

346
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:15,177
Scott: and also this guy did it and not only did he do it He made a YouTube video out of it Which is not something that we could do back in our day because we're so old fogies where

347
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:15,639
Rym: I would have

348
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:16,803
Scott: Probably

349
00:24:16,904 --> 00:24:17,285
Rym: I would have

350
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:18,670
Scott: probably but here

351
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,493
Rym: there's the price though.

352
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:25,020
Rym: Here's where this starts get a little more problematic Irrespective of what his intent was because that's a whole discussion in and of itself.

353
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:40,620
Rym: His YouTube account was shut down because of this video and simultaneously Even if he had no ill intent the people who seemed to be fans of that particular video Were fans of it for very fucked up shitty reasons.

354
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:46,526
Rym: Oh, yes as opposed to all the other videos he made which they didn't seem to care about at all They go those other videos.

355
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:49,400
Scott: He may do have lots of views just as many views as this one.

356
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,499
Scott: Oh, but the people who were so angry that his YouTube got shut down, right?

357
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,511
Scott: We're definitely, you know, not the opposite of feminists.

358
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:07,617
Scott: Yeah, right we could say right but anyway YouTube I guess saw the error of their ways or at least, you know believed that they was.

359
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:08,380
Scott: it was an error.

360
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,691
Scott: No, they believed it was an error.

361
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:10,538
Scott: I'm still not sure.

362
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:33,920
Scott: And they put his account back up With all those videos, but this is a. I got a lot of question marks on this one Because he also the dude also has you know prior lots of videos of killing Nazis and Klansmen and other things in video games in the same way And those also have tons of views.

363
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,691
Rym: I mean he upload the one he uploaded after the account got restored.

364
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:38,940
Rym: was Hitler gets punched off a cliff, right?

365
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,627
Scott: So it's like this particular guy seems to just.

366
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:45,980
Scott: it appears that he just likes killing NPCs in hilarious ways and games.

367
00:25:47,123 --> 00:25:49,880
Scott: He was perhaps taken off YouTube unfairly.

368
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:58,526
Scott: There's someone simultaneously some blame to be laid in the game makers for making games where these things can happen but also the feet.

369
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:02,334
Scott: there are fans that who are Uh-huh Misogynist.

370
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,343
Scott: yeah, this is a shit.

371
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:04,150
Scott: So right.

372
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:08,090
Rym: At what point is a creator?

373
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:22,510
Rym: Irrespective of their intentions Responsible for the behavior of their fans based solely on their fans reacting to the media and not anything outside of the media Mm-hmm, and that's uh as there's already topic that we can't get into because this is just a news and it's time I

374
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:23,695
Scott: don't have answers on this one.

375
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,925
Scott: Yeah, I got it's just so fascinating.

376
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:26,206
Scott: Got it.

377
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:28,469
Rym: You got to think about this Over in the brain.

378
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:30,923
Scott: Let it swim around your noggin.

379
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:32,667
Scott: this situation, but I gave you it's.

380
00:26:32,787 --> 00:26:34,210
Rym: uh, it's hanging out in the think meat.

381
00:26:34,472 --> 00:26:43,996
Rym: I think meat hasn't finished thinking but things of the day.

382
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:50,952
Rym: so Scott has Among many annoying qualities the most primary annoying quality Scott has.

383
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,640
Scott: Oh, really yours is making annoying noises on purpose.

384
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,407
Scott: I know they will annoy people yours.

385
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:57,113
Rym: Is that the first thing you ever kick-started?

386
00:26:57,153 --> 00:26:58,900
Rym: is this fucking really bright flashlight?

387
00:26:59,342 --> 00:27:00,790
Scott: That's my most annoying quality.

388
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:06,911
Rym: it's up there, okay In terms how often do I bring out the flashlight this way?

389
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:10,639
Scott: in terms of I mean if I'm holding the flashlight Yes, I will annoy you with it.

390
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,505
Scott: But how often is that the ratio?

391
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:21,811
Rym: much less often than rib making annoying noises, which he can make whenever you're a ratio of Milliseconds of time Scott is holding the flashlight to milliseconds of time.

392
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:22,954
Rym: Scott is annoying me with.

393
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:35,813
Rym: the flashlight is nearly a hundred percent but anyway This video has a flashlight like that and a flashlight That's way worse than that and then a water-cooled flashlight.

394
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:37,840
Rym: this dude made for the fuck of it.

395
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:42,151
Rym: That is basically the brightness of the Sun and holy shit.

396
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:43,374
Rym: Is this thing impressive?

397
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:46,602
Rym: Yeah, this is real fun to watch Like.

398
00:27:46,984 --> 00:27:48,368
Rym: basically there's a point where he's got this.

399
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:54,820
Rym: really he's on a campus and he's way far away from this building and they like Points a little like the normal flashlight of the building.

400
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:00,548
Rym: you see like this little light in the distance and then he points like a Fancier flashlight of the building can't just see it there.

401
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:04,300
Rym: and then he just stands there and turns on this flashlight that he made.

402
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,384
Rym: That's water-cooled 72,000 lumens.

403
00:28:09,384 --> 00:28:10,638
Scott: How did he measure the lumens?

404
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,909
Rym: Based on the rated output of the LEDs that he used to create it Did he use like a reflective cone to focus it?

405
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:19,993
Rym: He has what.

406
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:21,880
Scott: did you turn the light on and close his eyes?

407
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:24,593
Rym: He has a bunch of lenses and there's a whole video.

408
00:28:24,614 --> 00:28:25,900
Rym: He actually shows how we put it together.

409
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,168
Rym: It's actually pretty well constructed.

410
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,341
Rym: Okay, it's pretty small, too It's.

411
00:28:29,561 --> 00:28:36,980
Rym: uh, the video is really good because it's the creation process the like design process the execution and hilarity all rolled into one.

412
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:39,098
Rym: I would not look directly into this if I were you.

413
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,750
Rym: So what do you got?

414
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,733
Scott: so here is a cute.

415
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:46,700
Scott: I guess it's a music video.

416
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:51,209
Scott: There's a song But it's not really about the song.

417
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:54,038
Scott: it's mostly the lyrics but it's in Japanese and the subtitle.

418
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:54,459
Scott: so you're good.

419
00:28:55,682 --> 00:28:59,520
Rym: And in the music video this describes my entire childhood except without a futon.

420
00:29:00,062 --> 00:29:02,350
Scott: Yeah, there is a. there is a cute.

421
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:03,635
Scott: what I think is a penguin.

422
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,880
Scott: It's some sort of cute creature.

423
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,764
Rym: It looks like a penguin.

424
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,790
Scott: I think it's a penguin.

425
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,091
Scott: Of course.

426
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:07,714
Scott: Why is a penguin?

427
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:08,820
Rym: It could be that one Pokemon.

428
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:09,363
Rym: I don't know

429
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:24,580
Scott: why the penguin is upset about the cold if he's a penguin but the point is the story is the penguin is nice and sleepy and cozy in the futon and Does not want to come out because it's fucking cold and it's very appropriate because it's fucking November.

430
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:28,900
Scott: And then we just set the clocks back and it's dark when I leave work and fuck everybody.

431
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:32,077
Scott: But yes, this penguin is all of us.

432
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,651
Scott: Adjacent creature is all of us.

433
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,544
Rym: So when I was in like Elementary school.

434
00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:41,800
Rym: I remember I'd wake up in the morning and I've refused to get out of bed.

435
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,149
Rym: You don't be forced out of bed.

436
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:43,713
Rym: It'd be cold.

437
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:44,619
Rym: I don't want to get out of bed.

438
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:55,640
Rym: So what I'd end up doing is I would wrap all the blankets in my bed around myself And I go downstairs and I would I've done that and I would affix the blankets to one of the heat vents.

439
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:57,303
Scott: I did not do that.

440
00:29:57,323 --> 00:30:02,160
Rym: That's a fire hazard and I would stay in the blankets while I watch Teddy Ruxpin and ate my breakfast.

441
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:04,915
Scott: I did not do that and that was my morning ritual.

442
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:10,306
Rym: Okay So yeah in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book is 2001 a space Odyssey.

443
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:11,151
Rym: we're gonna read it soon.

444
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:11,976
Rym: We've been busy.

445
00:30:12,016 --> 00:30:12,499
Rym: boy read it.

00:30:13,704 --> 00:30:15,069
Scott: I'm reading as soon as I finish it.

00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:21,720
Scott: I'll read Immediately open 2001 and read it and I'm sure it won't take long.

449
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,710
Rym: We are going to be live in less than a month and PAX Unplugged.

450
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:28,397
Rym: Oh, she our second favorite packs.

Rym: December 2nd the 40 tabletop games.

454
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,232
Rym: You must play advanced mode because it's a tabletop con.

455
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:43,231
Rym: we can assume some things about the audience We couldn't assume at a general packs.

456
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:44,739
Rym: It's gonna be a real good time.

457
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:58,434
Rym: Otherwise, you should definitely if you need a Nazi free place to hang out on the internet join our forum because our forums been rockin And I started a pretty hot thread today that got way more attention than I expected.

458
00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:02,760
Scott: Yeah after PAX Unplugged We're gonna be going to PAX South.

459
00:31:03,216 --> 00:31:08,900
Scott: No We're gonna go mag fest mag fest and packs out and then just went on sale PAX East.

460
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:18,900
Scott: We told you and I think the last you guys episode that it was You know Perhaps urgent times for PAX East tickets and lo and behold they went on sale yesterday the day after the episode.

461
00:31:19,021 --> 00:31:23,925
Scott: Saturday is sold out, but all the other days are readily available Just not Saturday.

462
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:27,060
Scott: So I think there must be a lot of people who want to go just Saturday.

463
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:29,459
Scott: Just go to the expo hall and leave a lot of local people.

464
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,920
Scott: Yep, so but yeah, if you want to go to PAX East on any day, but Saturday tickets are you can just buy them.

465
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,772
Scott: No problem and good luck.

466
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,626
Scott: Good luck with hotels That's a problem.

467
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:47,247
Rym: Yep, but any day of PAX East is great because Thursday Yeah, they got the Q&A the opening shit Like it's a full-on packs day.

468
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:49,857
Rym: Friday and Saturday are like prime packs days.

469
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:51,624
Rym: Sunday It's less packs.

470
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:54,333
Rym: that ends earlier, but you get the omega-thon finale.

471
00:31:54,393 --> 00:31:55,015
Scott: It is all.

472
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:56,500
Scott: there's no day of packs.

473
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,080
Scott: It's better or worse than the other days overall, you know, so it's like hey pick pick whatever.

474
00:32:02,682 --> 00:32:06,900
Rym: Yeah, it's not Saturday cuz sold out and we're gonna be at all of these probably doing events and nonsense.

475
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:09,883
Rym: You know our usual stuff except at night Enforcing.

476
00:32:10,203 --> 00:32:21,077
Rym: and if you were a friend of ours who forgot to re-up their enforcer and got kicked out of everything Open applications for PAX East enforcing went live so you can get right back in.

477
00:32:21,197 --> 00:32:21,760
Scott: I didn't know the open.

478
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,987
Scott: I thought it was only the veteran call.

479
00:32:24,428 --> 00:32:25,391
Rym: It just went live.

480
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:26,936
Rym: Oh like a little while ago.

481
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:28,140
Rym: It looks like oh, okay.

482
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,800
Rym: Then cuz I just saw a link on the common enforce PAX East with us.

483
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,292
Scott: Yeah, you'll get two red shirts and turn.

484
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,740
Rym: forcing backs East is real fun.

485
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,500
Scott: You want to long sleeve red shirts and also frankly not have to buy badges.

486
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:41,302
Rym: Packs.

487
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:47,704
Rym: East has the security theater because the city of Boston is the city of cowards and they force pecs to do it against pecs As well.

488
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:55,179
Scott: Yeah, there was like Boston strong because Because all these horrible things happen in Boston literally no other packs has this problem.

489
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:58,012
Rym: pecs I was but there's fake bag checks and pecs.

490
00:32:58,092 --> 00:33:04,435
Rym: East has this like ridiculous security theater But if you're an enforcer you can just come in before that theater starts.

491
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:06,100
Scott: Yeah, this is what thing that I keep like.

492
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,206
Scott: It's like okay Boston.

493
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:08,796
Scott: It's like you had your marathon bombing.

494
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:09,440
Scott: It was real bad.

495
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:13,042
Scott: Yeah, we're not saying it wasn't no but and we had fucking 9/11.

496
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,172
Scott: It was way way worse.

497
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:15,060
Rym: multiple planes.

498
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:23,471
Scott: Your much smaller city has much more security than our much bigger city, you know And we've had a lot of other incidents.

499
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:26,925
Scott: We just convicted the frickin Subway bombing guy.

500
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,432
Scott: Oh, yeah, right just today.

501
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:29,617
Scott: I think or yesterday.

502
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:29,999
Scott: I don't know.

503
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:32,620
Scott: It's like we didn't go crazy with the security.

504
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,142
Scott: Why it is?

505
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:38,940
Scott: why is pecs as the Boston more of a fortress with their public events than New York PAX South?

506
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:40,042
Scott: People

507
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:53,203
Rym: who live in that area tend to have guns and try to bring them into places and yet the security of PAX South Which is the second worst security of any packs is literally people who pretend to look in your bags But don't actually

508
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:58,520
Scott: bag check at Boston events is more secure than the bag check at Madison Square Garden.

509
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:04,718
Scott: Yeah, the bag the Boston security Does have a bag check in metal detectors, but it's way breezier.

510
00:34:05,182 --> 00:34:06,425
Scott: Yeah Let's give a shit.

511
00:34:06,526 --> 00:34:12,940
Rym: the pay the the metal detectors and Nonsense at anime Boston are actually the only reason I stopped going to anime Boston.

512
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:20,956
Scott: I see where garden manages to get like 20,000 people into the building within like an under an hour Right, meanwhile PAX West just walk in.

513
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:25,976
Rym: Mm-hmm Like there's just a few nice old ladies like looking for your badge and that's about it.

514
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:29,697
Scott: Yep Anyway, so yeah, let's get on to the main bit.

515
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:31,824
Rym: So Yesterday two days ago.

516
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:44,119
Rym: We did a show about rollin rights and our news was a pretty innocuous thing about how a bunch of man babies freaked out that a game company announced a game that wasn't targeted at them but was in fact targeted at other people.

517
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:52,000
Rym: and Yeah, it started a surprising argument in our forum of people who are weirdly supportive of the man babies.

518
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:54,110
Rym: But we're not really talking about that.

519
00:34:54,493 --> 00:35:03,603
Rym: We want to talk about the broader I don't want to say problem, but just state of play of in the modern era like circa 2018

520
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:03,965
Scott: fans

521
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:15,039
Rym: of things and creators of things and how they interact because That is like that space has changed to a shocking degree even in the last five years let alone the last ten

522
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,240
Scott: years.

523
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,560
Scott: Well, I think we got to go back and look at like, you know nerd history a little bit, right?

524
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,464
Scott: So it's like okay.

525
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:46,420
Scott: Well originally, you know way back in the day It's like when when were there nerds like we think there are people doing nerdy things, you know But like people playing war games with little miniatures way back, but those weren't considered nerds Culturally a separate thing right, you know nerds weren't like their cultural own thing until like the 70s of the 80s Maybe and most of them were like computer science nerds, right?

526
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,375
Scott: They were smart people or like, you know, what the Poindexter in the 50s.

527
00:35:50,737 --> 00:35:53,364
Scott: It wasn't like People doing.

528
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:56,476
Scott: they were doing ham radio and they were maybe astronomy.

529
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:57,600
Scott: What were they doing those nerds?

530
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,095
Rym: But even when they did it was the organization of circles around.

531
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:05,287
Rym: nerdy and geeky hobbies of any kind Were relative like.

532
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:11,560
Rym: they were mostly local and when they were larger than that It was very slow to organize and disseminate information.

533
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:11,741
Rym: Well

534
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:32,236
Scott: also though I'm saying is though all those nerds up until maybe like 70s 80s 90s Right the prior nerds were people who were just smart, you know, that was there and they were culturally uncool supposedly at least in pop culture and They were people who did things like.

535
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:43,124
Scott: they made stuff Right, like the word the term hacker comes from the MIT model train club because they were underneath the trains hacking away Right.

536
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:44,509
Scott: That's where the term hacking comes from.

537
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:46,316
Scott: If you did not know you can look it up.

538
00:36:46,396 --> 00:36:47,260
Scott: I guarantee I'm right.

539
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:49,607
Scott: They were making something right.

540
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,290
Scott: model train is.

541
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,400
Scott: that is active creative hobby, right?

542
00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:06,174
Scott: You know it was in the 70s mostly 80s 90s and I know this history because I fucking lived it that nerdery moved more and more away from a Creating being smart thing to a.

543
00:37:06,556 --> 00:37:11,413
Rym: I wouldn't Say we have to conflate the two creating and being smart.

544
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:13,199
Rym: There are people who create very evil.

545
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:18,868
Rym: That's not what I'm conflating Your weird value judgments here.

546
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:33,350
Scott: I'm moving until it's time nerdery moved away from things like being smart and creating things to Consumer capitalism, well, I think being a nerd today is Collecting stuff buying stuff.

547
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,818
Scott: Look at what happened with comic books in the 90s.

548
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,601
Scott: It used to be.

549
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:39,896
Rym: let's get away from nerder and talk more about fan like fan identity.

550
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:45,312
Scott: Those are the same thing Yep, because because nowadays a lot of nerds are you know, we're like geeks.

551
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:47,578
Scott: it moved, you know are just fans.

552
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:59,287
Rym: now There were like Trekkies or trekkers Like all the Star Trek stuff in the late 60s early 70s and like people who were fans of Doctor Who like That culture was there.

553
00:37:59,588 --> 00:38:01,175
Scott: Yeah, you look at like that's like the 70s 80s and 90s.

554
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,138
Rym: Yeah, like, you know the creepy-ass emails that Asimov would get.

555
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:10,560
Scott: yeah I'm saying comic book guy is you know, he came about 80s 90s when comic book guy became a thing.

556
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,403
Scott: There was no comic.

557
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:19,011
Scott: but if you tried to bring Simpsons comic book guy to the 60s of the 50s, they'll be an unrecognizable Character now because comic book stores didn't exist.

558
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:21,080
Scott: They sold comic books in grocery stores to kids.

559
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:23,165
Scott: No one was collecting them really.

560
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:25,170
Scott: maybe like one or two weirdos, right?

561
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,777
Scott: It wasn't until like speculation came about.

562
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:39,360
Rym: but even then Because of the cost of the means of production the creators were mostly Corporations and professionals who had a significant distance from the fans of the thing.

563
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:55,100
Rym: so most of these fan culture events Even if they became mostly about consumption and debate about and around the thing and maybe displaying social currency about the thing That phantom operated entirely independently of the creation of the thing.

564
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,460
Scott: Well, also a lot of those things right came about as just like comic books, right?

565
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:06,680
Scott: Like when you were kids, it was what transformers and stuff right Voltron mask mask, you know, GI Joes, right?

566
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,900
Scott: It's like those all those things which are super consumer capitalist, right?

567
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,071
Scott: It's literally cartoons to sell toys to kids in Japan as well.

568
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:17,923
Scott: Right and other countries and It.

569
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:19,429
Scott: those were just kids things.

570
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:29,520
Scott: and then 10 20 years on People are still into those things and they became now nerd fan things as where they were originally just kids things.

571
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:43,106
Rym: But even then let's look at Meg Mike my magic the gathering fandom or my dungeons and dragons gathering was invented in 90s Yep But when I was a kid both playing Dungeons & Dragons and playing magic Deeply invested in these.

572
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:45,775
Rym: these activities are part of my wider identity.

573
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:53,440
Rym: at the same time I had no access to the people who created magic the gathering or created Dungeons & Dragons, right?

574
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,460
Scott: So this is this is the two-step thing, right?

575
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,675
Scott: so there's the move from the from nerdery being a creative thing to a consumer thing.

576
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:12,160
Scott: and then there's the suddenly can you know consumers can now have the internet and can now talk and post and complain and Tweet at companies.

577
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:34,636
Rym: yep, which is fine in a sense because even though fan like there's like gummer gate and like people might organize get weird about it at least Ostensibly for a while the fact remained that the company was a large enough faceless enough entity to have the same like General protection that a modern for real celebrity does like no matter how creepy you are.

578
00:40:34,696 --> 00:40:38,408
Rym: You can't get that close to Tom Cruise Like you can't you want to.

579
00:40:38,428 --> 00:40:40,240
Rym: but let's say you didn't say you're obsessed with Tom Cruise.

580
00:40:40,823 --> 00:40:41,246
Rym: You kids.

581
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:43,640
Rym: it would be very high if I was obsessed with Tom Cruise.

582
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:47,820
Rym: I couldn't you join his crazy cult, but I couldn't get that physically close to him.

583
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:50,360
Rym: There's no way for me to call him on the phone.

584
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:58,440
Rym: There's really no way for him to in any way know I exist and no matter how crazy my rants are out there They're not gonna get to him personally.

585
00:40:58,821 --> 00:40:59,343
Rym: They're gonna add.

586
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:06,179
Rym: most get to like a PR handler who aggregates this into a sentiment that his Social media teams gonna use to craft his image.

587
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:17,194
Rym: But then another revolution happened and that revolution was I can just live stream something on YouTube And there are people who live stream shit on YouTube who now became like.

588
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:27,980
Rym: they have fandoms that are very big But they're still just individual people who while they are now famous They do not have like a corporate team to distance themselves from their fans.

589
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:32,189
Rym: They don't have the tools to deal with that situation.

590
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,100
Rym: and now we're in a modern world where people create things.

591
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:37,586
Rym: There are fans of those things.

592
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:41,340
Rym: those fans can like show up at the front door of the person who created the thing.

593
00:41:41,963 --> 00:41:51,541
Rym: And those fans are so organized and so mobilized with social media That they can actually start to threaten and interact directly with these big faceless companies despite those Protects.

594
00:41:51,622 --> 00:42:02,340
Scott: right if I back in the day if I sent a letter to the comic book company to get printed on the letters page In Game Pro or something they may not print it they could edit it and then print it.

595
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,428
Scott: You know one person would read it right.

596
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:07,540
Scott: yeah, I guess sort of letter writing campaign, but that would be pretty hard.

597
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,725
Scott: Yeah, it's not easy.

598
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:10,694
Scott: That's why they're effective because if you pull one off.

599
00:42:10,754 --> 00:42:11,236
Scott: It's like whoa.

600
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:12,100
Scott: this must be legit.

601
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:16,815
Scott: But if you're a streamer, it's like okay some normal schmuck nerd.

602
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:19,142
Scott: right he was you know It's not some.

603
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:37,342
Scott: someone who's like being controlled by some journalistic integrity or anything at a paper or magazine or something is Not only a have fans of their own that are coming at them But they also can wield their fans as an army at Corporations.

604
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:37,602
Scott: right.

605
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:48,377
Scott: so the corporation which you know Tom Cruise kidding nor the one email from a nut job that he doesn't even read Or know exists because he doesn't read email probably, but can he ignore the?

606
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,385
Scott: Ninja or someone you know?

607
00:42:51,606 --> 00:42:55,599
Scott: six like an army of like a thousand fans to make a harassment campaign against him.

608
00:42:56,382 --> 00:43:00,200
Rym: But there's maybe not but there's a final piece of this puzzle that brings it all together.

609
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:06,700
Rym: So we're not gonna fans not gonna like nerds and geeks and whatever, but the nerds and geeks from these earlier areas.

610
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:09,189
Rym: It wasn't just that they had a very deep hobby.

611
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:13,985
Rym: It was also that they built their personal identity Around that hobby.

612
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:15,430
Scott: right well, that's why simultaneously.

613
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,217
Scott: That's why I started with the capitalism point.

614
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:34,498
Rym: simultaneously We have this growth of like very intense fandoms That now we have people who have built this similar intense personal identity around something that is solely Being a fan of something as opposed to any particular activity related to said thing.

615
00:43:34,618 --> 00:43:40,936
Scott: well look The whole point I brought up capitalism to begin with right is that look at capitalism outside of nerdery right.

616
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:49,040
Scott: you know someone goes And they they're taught a to vote with their dollars right as if you know where they spend their dollars.

617
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:50,509
Scott: I spent dollars.

618
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:52,340
Scott: therefore I deserve something.

619
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,971
Scott: I'm voting right if I buy something and it's no good.

620
00:43:55,991 --> 00:43:57,395
Scott: I have a right to complain.

621
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:00,444
Scott: I spent money on it, right It's like somehow.

622
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:08,309
Scott: There's this belief that we've created in our culture that when you spend money on something It's like you know I'm paying you to do this.

623
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:09,533
Scott: you do what I say.

624
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:13,969
Scott: there's some sort of like slavery Relationship, but you know if you're at your job.

625
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:15,213
Scott: It's like I'm paying you.

626
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:16,317
Scott: you do what I say.

627
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:17,742
Scott: you're the employee I'm the boss.

628
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:22,556
Scott: if money goes one way then then complete obedience must go in the other way.

629
00:44:22,596 --> 00:44:26,294
Scott: if I buy something at a grocery Store then the groceries, and I don't like what.

630
00:44:26,314 --> 00:44:27,260
Scott: it doesn't taste good.

631
00:44:27,461 --> 00:44:30,900
Scott: They had to give you my money back or they're about to treat me nicely.

632
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,910
Scott: They have to do what I want because I'm giving them money right.

633
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:42,820
Scott: and then we bring that capitalist belief Into the consumer nerdery area, and it's like I'm buying this video game from you.

634
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:48,504
Scott: You must patch it to fix this and do what I say I'm the consumer right.

635
00:44:48,544 --> 00:44:54,320
Scott: that same attitude has been brought over across the board right and we have always a GeekNights.

636
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,559
Scott: We've been pretty consistent on this.

637
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,335
Scott: I think is that we've always said no fuck fuck whatever your fans say right.

638
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:01,459
Scott: look what happened to tribes, too.

639
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:04,409
Scott: I did everything the fan said the game died.

640
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,536
Scott: look at counter-strike from before.

641
00:45:06,596 --> 00:45:13,680
Scott: counter-strike 1.0 Was out banded AWP and they don't you feel that counter-strike forums were full of hardcore nerds?

642
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:20,249
Scott: Complaining and thinking they knew better about how to modify counter-strike and What those counter-strike people could be.

643
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:22,780
Scott: being the other guy they didn't listen to shit.

644
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,900
Scott: They did what they thought and it was best and it's counter-strike the number one game right now.

645
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:30,100
Scott: No, fortnight is but it was but a long goddamn.

646
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,172
Scott: It was for a long goddamn time, and it's still a relevant game today.

647
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:37,140
Scott: because they did not listen to their fans, right?

648
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:42,036
Scott: I was actually just I listened to part of a podcast today where our friend Luke Crane was on it.

649
00:45:42,317 --> 00:45:47,015
Scott: Oh, right and They were talking to him about how like you know he taught.

650
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:53,510
Scott: he was talking about how a Kickstarter He hired someone who is not necessarily Deep in in the games world because he's like.

651
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:53,631
Scott: well.

652
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:58,584
Scott: We already have a person who's deep in the games But he's like do we?

653
00:45:58,624 --> 00:45:59,546
Scott: don't you know?

654
00:45:59,747 --> 00:46:00,068
Scott: do you?

655
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:01,010
Scott: do you need to be?

656
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,108
Scott: You know just because you played a lot of games right?

657
00:46:05,649 --> 00:46:09,440
Scott: does that mean you know enough to work in games, right?

658
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:10,499
Scott: I eat a lot of food.

659
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:13,768
Scott: He's like I eat food multiple times a day.

660
00:46:14,049 --> 00:46:14,952
Scott: I love eating food.

661
00:46:15,092 --> 00:46:20,953
Rym: I have watched that mean you could be a chef Of ice hockey and so have you.

662
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:22,079
Scott: I can't even skate.

663
00:46:23,624 --> 00:46:36,577
Scott: Being a consumer of a thing provides you absolutely no qualifications in terms of Judging how the thing should be made or being able to work in the industry that produces that thing.

664
00:46:36,617 --> 00:46:49,797
Rym: but because Fans have taken this like nerd culture over to the point that the fans Feel like like it's the thing they're a fan of is such a part of their identity that they assume They are experts on the thing mm-hmm.

665
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:58,180
Scott: So all that said well I mean you know even you know sports fans have been calling into sports radio thinking they know how to run that team.

666
00:46:58,322 --> 00:46:59,158
Scott: Yeah, fire the couch.

667
00:47:00,761 --> 00:47:03,695
Scott: That's a long tradition of fandom is like I'm buying tickets.

668
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:04,719
Scott: you better put a good.

669
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:15,340
Scott: It's that same attitude, but because nerdery became a Consumer thing that has been brought over as well and is mixed with the nerd culture.

670
00:47:15,743 --> 00:47:32,090
Rym: So where we are today as a result I guess we just pick different like specific points from here until we get hungry and run out of steam, but The thing that's been coming up recently a lot that really bothers me specifically because it's causing the most harm Is that the fans will be entitled about?

671
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:35,530
Rym: About things that they made up themselves.

672
00:47:36,172 --> 00:47:38,742
Rym: So like this happens in like at least they're creating.

673
00:47:38,782 --> 00:47:39,786
Scott: at least they're creating something.

674
00:47:39,846 --> 00:47:54,089
Rym: yeah, but like But like my little pony fandom Steven Universe fandom like all these animation fandoms you see these kids who will like their identity is Infested in this fucking property like this cartoon is my soul.

675
00:47:55,012 --> 00:48:02,110
Rym: And then they make some bullshit up about this thing like these two characters will kiss because reasons here is my.

676
00:48:02,571 --> 00:48:23,687
Rym: Here's my manifesto on why this is true, and then when the show doesn't reflect the made-up bullshit They feel betrayed both by the creators who did the wrong thing in their eyes and By the fact that their personal identity has now been ruined because they've tied it to a commercial Property that they watched on television.

677
00:48:23,928 --> 00:48:24,089
Scott: right.

678
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:29,908
Scott: well I mean this goes back to what I was saying before about creating things right is like if you are someone who?

679
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:32,837
Scott: Well think about Bill Gates.

680
00:48:32,857 --> 00:48:34,325
Scott: yeah, okay, I think Bill Gates.

681
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:34,667
Scott: I don't know.

682
00:48:34,687 --> 00:48:39,590
Scott: for some reason I think this there was like a quote that was maybe I don't know attributed to him.

683
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:44,450
Scott: I don't know if it's true or not And I think that's why I keep thinking of him whenever I bring this point up which I brought up many times.

684
00:48:44,731 --> 00:48:48,570
Scott: But anyway Bill Gates is someone if you don't know who fucking loves cars.

685
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:54,429
Scott: He's got like a garage full of like a zillion Porsches and shit like he's crazy, but do you ever say it's like that too?

686
00:48:55,151 --> 00:49:00,470
Scott: Jay Leno, I think is also one right, but do you ever say Bill Gates the car lover?

687
00:49:01,252 --> 00:49:01,373
Scott: Mmm.

688
00:49:01,473 --> 00:49:04,064
Scott: Do you ever say you know it's like he loves to play bridge.

689
00:49:04,285 --> 00:49:05,510
Scott: He's huge on bridge, right?

690
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:05,932
Scott: He plays bridge.

691
00:49:06,094 --> 00:49:08,370
Scott: you ever say Bill Gates bridge player?

692
00:49:08,772 --> 00:49:12,670
Scott: No, you say Bill Gates founder of Microsoft once richest person on earth.

693
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,135
Scott: That's what his identity is right.

694
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:24,085
Scott: because he did something he accomplished something he made something that Overrides all the other things that would normally be his identity right.

695
00:49:24,346 --> 00:49:25,430
Scott: so look at me.

696
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:30,630
Scott: It's like I like Mega Man right, but do you ever say Scott Mega Man fans?

697
00:49:31,293 --> 00:49:34,329
Scott: No, it's got GeekNights' annoying podcast asshole.

698
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:38,876
Scott: Yeah I don't have to make something good You just have to make something.

699
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:40,742
Scott: and now that becomes your identity.

700
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:43,852
Scott: if you are you know it's like believe it I make X.

701
00:49:44,253 --> 00:49:52,290
Rym: I do X. there's a lot of there's a lot of lines there, but pure passive consumption as primary identity I think is a very dangerous combination.

702
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:57,425
Rym: that's what happens to see me like a middle road cuz gaming is doing there's like it is consuming.

703
00:49:57,625 --> 00:50:04,390
Rym: doing making right and Consuming coupled with entitlement is dangerous to the point of being deadly.

704
00:50:05,512 --> 00:50:14,010
Scott: Those people if they don't make anything or accomplish anything Which is actually you know kind of hard to do when you're so young especially yeah, right?

705
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:20,610
Scott: It's like how could you how many teenagers can we expect even if they're trying to reasonably accomplish or do anything?

706
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,796
Scott: That would become their identity.

707
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:27,733
Scott: so early in life not many right which me, but early in life A lot of free time.

708
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:31,847
Scott: they're gonna consume a lot of media, so that's gonna be their identity.

709
00:50:31,867 --> 00:50:33,829
Scott: Yeah, right It's like you know.

710
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:38,710
Scott: It's like how many how many people have like an uncle and like or whatever or someone in your family?

711
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,406
Scott: He was like a huge sports fan to the point where that is their identity.

712
00:50:42,526 --> 00:50:44,292
Scott: I am so-and-so Cheesehead.

713
00:50:44,553 --> 00:50:46,284
Scott: yeah, it's like I live in Green Bay.

714
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:47,210
Scott: I'm a Packers fan.

715
00:50:47,452 --> 00:50:49,770
Scott: I got a room full of Packers shed all over the walls.

716
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:51,920
Scott: That's their identity because that's what they do.

717
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,302
Scott: is there?

718
00:50:52,885 --> 00:50:57,279
Scott: they don't make anything They have a job, but no really the thing they care most about.

719
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,854
Scott: is that because they haven't accomplished anything else to override that in Their in their lives?

720
00:51:02,076 --> 00:51:03,381
Rym: no an interesting counterpoint.

721
00:51:03,402 --> 00:51:05,230
Rym: There is that for young people today?

722
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:12,650
Rym: I get there's a very distinct like worry the sort of adjacent to this that a lot of young people are creating stuff very visibly.

723
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:23,930
Rym: But as a result there's a lot of pressure on people who made like maybe they're not ready to make something or they got other Going on to make stuff before they're ready and to be visible about it.

724
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:42,170
Rym: which one makes people who make or do things that aren't highly visible feel inadequate and to Puts people under an intense pressure to succeed in areas that they might not be able to succeed And then they'll tie that identity up with their own life and get depressed and have problems like GeekNights is moderately successful.

725
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:45,658
Rym: But at the same time we we have money And we just fund it.

726
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:45,900
Rym: like.

727
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:53,579
Rym: I don't need You to watch for me to keep doing this because I can afford to eat And I don't care if you watch it.

728
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:54,702
Rym: I do okay.

729
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:58,039
Rym: Yeah, but because I make we're your makers You're making right here.

730
00:51:58,059 --> 00:51:58,726
Rym: We're making stuff.

731
00:51:59,009 --> 00:51:59,792
Scott: Yeah I don't need people to.

732
00:52:00,274 --> 00:52:04,168
Scott: I can make stuff and enjoy making stuff without anybody and seeing it.

733
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:05,514
Rym: yep But I feel like

734
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:11,982
Scott: I'm happy to make wooden chairs and at a roadside shack and have nobody buy them, but I guess

735
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:26,230
Rym: I worry that the Performative making stuff of the modern streaming culture puts an intense and new pressure on Generations younger than us to do similar things instead of less visible making pursuits.

736
00:52:27,052 --> 00:52:36,380
Scott: Another thing that's going on right is that we used to be right that the only people who made stuff for the the big-time Publishing giant companies right now.

737
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,010
Rym: You cost to make GeekNights ten bucks and four bucks.

738
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,432
Rym: Oh, you know what?

739
00:52:39,513 --> 00:52:40,317
Rym: zero dollars a month.

740
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,850
Rym: you can host a podcast on patreon for free or SoundCloud.

741
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:46,482
Rym: Yeah, any bucks a month for Adobe Creative Cloud $100 microphone.

742
00:52:46,503 --> 00:52:47,004
Rym: You're good to go.

743
00:52:47,526 --> 00:52:56,470
Scott: Anyway, the point is Nowadays, you know, I think this really became first visible on the internet at least most visible on the internet with open source software.

744
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:03,900
Scott: But to other people who didn't were in that community with the webcomic people It's like if you're a webcomic and you had fans.

745
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,790
Scott: those fans would be like, why is there no comic today?

746
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,396
Scott: They weren't even paying the money.

747
00:53:08,557 --> 00:53:11,370
Scott: Yeah, they didn't even have the capitalist relationship of money.

748
00:53:11,891 --> 00:53:18,050
Rym: Dare you not draw the free picture for me on Tuesday like you didn't even promise you would right.

749
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:18,351
Scott: It's like.

750
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:20,198
Scott: that's some of the earliest instances.

751
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:21,222
Scott: I can remember.

752
00:53:21,362 --> 00:53:23,430
Rym: I remember that like not that we're super fans.

753
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:27,235
Rym: There's a lot of issues with mega Tokyo But we're respective of any of that.

754
00:53:27,757 --> 00:53:32,850
Rym: the fans of mega Tokyo were real shitty to that dude if he didn't put up a comic.

755
00:53:33,052 --> 00:53:36,961
Rym: Yep, yep Penny arcade - they used to get a lot of flat course.

756
00:53:37,142 --> 00:53:39,110
Rym: They never failed to put ever they never missed.

757
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:46,309
Rym: They get flack for not doing more than they were already doing even though they were 100% consistent anyway.

758
00:53:47,913 --> 00:53:51,990
Scott: But yeah, it's you know, this this sort of thing where it's like I'm consuming your thing, you know.

759
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:58,261
Scott: And the other thing is you get these communities right and the communities form around The things that you're consuming.

760
00:53:58,281 --> 00:54:05,930
Rym: Yeah, but now as a creator Am I responsible for the lot for the like health and safety of a community that formed?

761
00:54:06,111 --> 00:54:07,859
Rym: Independent of me around a thing.

762
00:54:07,899 --> 00:54:09,205
Rym: I happen to put on the internet, right?

763
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,210
Scott: It's like and here's the thing.

764
00:54:10,632 --> 00:54:13,430
Scott: There's like two big things that go on with communities.

765
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:19,928
Scott: One is a community forms around around a thing because it started because people were consuming the same thing.

766
00:54:19,988 --> 00:54:20,810
Scott: say Star Wars.

767
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:21,480
Scott: That's the biggest.

768
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:25,110
Scott: right now There's people who are consuming Star Wars in some fashion.

769
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:32,889
Scott: so they end up adjacent to each other for because they're buying the same thing or looking at the same thing and Then they form a community.

770
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:38,003
Scott: Right, it's Star Wars people who didn't attempt to make that community.

771
00:54:38,043 --> 00:54:40,189
Scott: Are they responsible for it somewhat?

772
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:45,957
Scott: because The product that they're making is somehow Influencing that community.

773
00:54:46,138 --> 00:54:49,150
Rym: Ah, but the others at the other coin look at the other side of the coin.

774
00:54:49,671 --> 00:55:01,350
Rym: Look at what happened with the new Star Wars movie where the shitty fans of Star Wars who are basically racist and or misogynist Freaked out about the media being good.

775
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,698
Scott: Usually don't see someone who's only one or the other.

776
00:55:03,738 --> 00:55:11,563
Scott: you ever see someone like massage this but absolutely the opposite of racist Yeah, or someone who's racist, but is like super women's right?

777
00:55:11,784 --> 00:55:14,735
Rym: Yeah, like usually if you peel that onion back They're both in there.

778
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:17,970
Scott: It's like I feel like if you're really hard to be one and not the other.

779
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:20,117
Scott: Well, you know anyone like that.

780
00:55:20,157 --> 00:55:20,699
Scott: Let me know.

781
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:31,329
Rym: it's real hard to put any responsibility On the creators of current Star Wars for the shitty misogynist who are fans of Star Wars who are mad about what they did.

782
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:48,710
Rym: Yet the media directly caused Directly triggered those shitty people to be shittier And those people those fans with their because their identities are wrapped up in it Organize around how mad they are about it and become a real threat to the creator.

783
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:48,892
Rym: Well,

784
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:58,522
Scott: the point is the the content of the original Creation right does have some effect on the kind of people that will come to the community originally

785
00:55:58,582 --> 00:56:05,629
Rym: with the caveat that once you get above a certain line from Like niche market to mass market all bets are off, right?

786
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:23,730
Scott: The second thing is that this is what I see is a problem as the main cause of most especially in nerderies of conflicts within communities is People come to the same community for different reasons and like the same thing for a completely different reason.

787
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:29,270
Scott: So you might have two people who both really both play this board game, right?

788
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:33,779
Scott: pick whatever board game you can think of and Danny land, let's go one person.

789
00:56:33,799 --> 00:56:36,030
Scott: Let's do netrunner because that's way easy.

790
00:56:36,731 --> 00:57:01,288
Scott: one person comes into netrunner because they're all about that cyberpunk theme and They they love storytelling and how when you play the game like a cool cyberpunk story you know evolves and comes out which does happen if you play netrunner, right and someone else and that person buys netrunner cards and plays netrunner and goes to netrunner events and somebody else plays netrunner because they want to Fucking win and they play games competitively.

791
00:57:01,629 --> 00:57:02,774
Scott: They pay attention to math.

792
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:04,440
Scott: They want to win in netrunner tournaments.

793
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:08,454
Scott: Right, these people both come into the netrunner community, right?

794
00:57:08,795 --> 00:57:10,080
Scott: Those people have nothing in common.

795
00:57:10,402 --> 00:57:11,348
Scott: They basically are there.

796
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:13,240
Scott: they might as well be fans of really different things.

797
00:57:13,561 --> 00:57:27,797
Scott: They don't actually share anything, but now they're in the same community space together because this one consumer item is sort of serving both of their interests and They've come together and they will conflict if they happen to like play a game with each other.

798
00:57:27,817 --> 00:57:28,460
Rym: It will not go.

799
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,925
Rym: Well now this got to the point.

800
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:32,232
Rym: like like Star Wars fans.

801
00:57:32,734 --> 00:57:34,540
Rym: I am a fan of Star Wars like I like Star Wars.

802
00:57:35,146 --> 00:57:42,100
Rym: I would never Interact with a group dedicated to that fandom under any circumstances, right?

803
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,509
Scott: Yeah, and there's plenty of like this, you know, there's the.

804
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:45,956
Scott: what are they called the something 38?

805
00:57:45,956 --> 00:57:50,880
Scott: they make the cool Costumes and stuff right there in it for these cosplay reasons.

806
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:55,017
Scott: But meanwhile, there's the other people who are making like robot are two real r2d2s, right?

807
00:57:56,081 --> 00:58:00,120
Scott: And they're all programming and making robots and shit and those people could write get along and have fun together.

808
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,031
Scott: Yeah, right and they probably bring the r2d2 to the cosplay event.

809
00:58:03,052 --> 00:58:04,899
Scott: Those actually probably aren't too distant as the.

810
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:07,210
Scott: Enjoy the theme and enjoy winning it.

811
00:58:07,271 --> 00:58:13,977
Scott: Yeah, but the point is Maybe someone who's way into Star Wars The card game, right?

812
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,852
Scott: Along with the people who are into Star Wars.

813
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:24,500
Rym: There's a Blizzcon example The people are into World of Warcraft for the lore and role-playing versus the people are into it for the grind fest in the raids.

814
00:58:24,903 --> 00:58:26,619
Rym: Those communities don't overlap that much?

815
00:58:27,081 --> 00:58:28,085
Scott: No, right.

816
00:58:28,145 --> 00:58:32,140
Scott: and then so now right because the the episode isn't about community problems.

817
00:58:32,222 --> 00:58:50,720
Scott: It's about you know the relationship between the big fans and the creator is now your creator of World of Warcraft and you have this community of people who consume your product and There are hugely disparate factions and you cannot serve one without upsetting the other.

818
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:56,720
Rym: Yep, and the consequences of upsetting any one of them can often lead to weird internet hate mobs.

819
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,090
Scott: Yeah, I give you know, it's like okay.

820
00:58:59,150 --> 00:58:59,612
Scott: I'm right.

821
00:58:59,692 --> 00:59:01,480
Scott: I'm the lady who writes Harry Potter.

822
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,332
Scott: It's like well if I do this, it'll upset the fanfiction people.

823
00:59:04,372 --> 00:59:06,240
Scott: I got to do this for the movie fans.

824
00:59:06,361 --> 00:59:06,883
Scott: I gotta do that.

825
00:59:06,903 --> 00:59:09,336
Scott: You know, it's like it's too much going on there.

826
00:59:09,376 --> 00:59:10,100
Scott: What are you gonna do?

827
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,173
Scott: Yeah, right no matter what you do someone's going to yell at you and be way mad.

828
00:59:14,554 --> 00:59:21,518
Scott: and you can hear them because it's 2018 and if it was 1918 you would never hear from anybody unless they wrote you a handwritten note.

829
00:59:21,578 --> 00:59:22,220
Scott: and you get like two.

830
00:59:22,844 --> 00:59:38,411
Rym: So I guess cuz we've gone on a while here I think that the morals to really think about like the real takeaways are one we need to figure out a way to Prevent people from wrapping up their personal like real identity with a thing they happen to be a fan of.

831
00:59:38,532 --> 00:59:42,650
Scott: that people need to Realize that creators don't owe you shit.

832
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:44,999
Scott: the person who makes the thing that you like.

833
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:45,641
Scott: They.

834
00:59:45,722 --> 00:59:49,394
Scott: it's up to them to do whatever the fuck they want and what they think is best.

835
00:59:49,695 --> 00:59:54,140
Scott: and you can I mean you can Say whatever you want because freedom of speech or whatever express yourself.

836
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,080
Scott: But if they you don't like it tough fucking cookies deal with it.

837
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,429
Scott: If you think it should have gone better make it your damn self.

838
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:16,855
Rym: and two we need to figure out a way to prevent the more rabid fans from organizing against people who don't have any like Support mechanism to protect themselves from that.

839
01:00:17,177 --> 01:00:18,840
Rym: Mm-hmm And that's it Like.

840
01:00:19,061 --> 01:00:20,887
Rym: that is a real serious problem right now.

841
01:00:20,928 --> 01:00:24,500
Rym: people who were in Star Wars were driven away from social media.

842
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:32,000
Rym: You think those people don't have like protective networks already and still they're driven off of social media by these rabid horrid fans.

843
01:00:32,141 --> 01:00:36,039
Scott: Right there needs to be a way for people to live their lives in.

844
01:00:36,881 --> 01:00:45,560
Scott: You know creating and putting out public art and even if that art is, you know Very much despised they and maybe even deservedly.

845
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,034
Scott: So they shouldn't be a sale because of it.

846
01:00:49,054 --> 01:00:55,283
Scott: and that goes back to like, you know I get in Middle Ages or whatever people would make like heretical arts and get Right.

847
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:55,825
Rym: Oh my god.

848
01:00:55,845 --> 01:00:56,688
Rym: in the Tower of London.

849
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:57,632
Rym: We're gonna end on this.

850
01:00:57,672 --> 01:00:59,720
Rym: So there's all this graffiti in the Tower of London.

851
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:17,180
Rym: there's one part where like prisoners were held and there's this one dude who wrote all this graffiti and His story was basically he was arrested for being a sorcerer Uh-huh, and his defense was I was a sorcerer that is true, but I am NOT a sorcerer anymore.

852
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:29,776
Rym: I haven't done it in a long time and I definitely didn't curse the people who like sent me here Mm-hmm, you know what his sorcery was like, you know what it was literally mmm astronomy texts.

853
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:33,815
Rym: Mm-hmm Alright, I gotta get some food and do some stuff.

854
01:01:33,835 --> 01:01:34,519
Rym: I think we're done here.

855
01:01:34,781 --> 01:01:36,386
Rym: Okay, so take it to the forum.

856
01:01:36,487 --> 01:01:37,611
Rym: have an argument about this.

857
01:01:38,012 --> 01:01:39,939
Rym: There's already one argument in the forum going on.

01:01:46,274 --> 01:01:48,810
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
