00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,150
Rym: It's Tuesday November 20th 2018.

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,113
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,420
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:17,009
Rym: We are hype for PAX Unplugged.

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,859
Rym: It's coming up, and it's the second one ever.

6
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,717
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:36,374
Rym: So one of the things I have to do in the course of my job because I'm like a business manager owner type these days like a product manager is I gotta like go to team dinners like take a bunch of people out to Stuff and like hang out with all you know the people who actually build.

8
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:40,152
Rym: because I don't build anything I just decide what to build and how to build it and when to build it.

9
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:41,820
Rym: the easy part to it.

10
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,479
Rym: It's surprising how hard that part is sometimes.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,560
Rym: But so I'm at one of these things and I got a team that pretty cool.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,283
Rym: They're all like really gamer e. so we're talking about like game stuff And it's fun.

13
00:00:52,745 --> 00:01:02,525
Rym: and then at one point someone's like one of my one of my like senior engineers It was real good says something like yeah, I really love Classic console gaming.

14
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:04,691
Scott: uh-huh is he gonna say some PlayStation game?

15
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:10,282
Rym: PlayStation 2 I picked up used GameCube Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:19,719
Rym: so already like I'm already feeling old like you can see like Rym's feeling of age Escalates rapidly at this point, and I got the original Smash Brothers for it.

17
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,706
Rym: That was the first one right.

18
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:26,531
Rym: there couldn't have been one before that.

19
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:31,305
Rym: yeah, yeah this conversation just made me feel Incredibly old.

20
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:37,587
Scott: so on the internet today, so in these in the Nintendo switch subreddit Everyone's of course like Metroid Prime 4 when's it coming?

21
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:38,189
Scott: when's it coming?

22
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:42,300
Scott: right, but people have basically been based on no information whatsoever.

23
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:51,387
Scott: Right have basically been in assuming praying begging that Nintendo will re-release all the old Metroid Prime 1 2 3 Which they already did on the Wii.

24
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:56,220
Scott: there was a Metroid Prime trilogy re-release disc But they're hoping for Metroid Prime re-release HD.

25
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:01,117
Scott: They really want this for some reason and I'm like you could probably for less than the cost.

26
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:04,650
Scott: even if they put that out It'll be like 60 bucks for less than the cost of that.

27
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:09,779
Scott: you could probably go get an old Wii or GameCube and the original discs or that trilogy disc for the Wii.

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Scott: Why the fuck do you need this re-released for the switch although?

29
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,347
Scott: I must say again.

30
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:17,352
Scott: It is really stupid.

31
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:26,740
Scott: if I was the CEO of Nintendo Every single game ever published by Nintendo would be in the e-shop Or there would be some sort of Netflix subscription, and you would just get them all the end

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,704
Rym: Yeah, I feel like

33
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:31,240
Scott: because it's like yeah, you could just go get it, but that's sort of a pain in the ass.

34
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:39,692
Rym: Yeah, the Nintendo service the problem is Nintendo is incapable of like working In anything other than the Nintendo silo is the problem.

35
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,197
Rym: like they have they're set in their ways.

36
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:42,140
Rym: nothing will ever fix that.

37
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:42,484
Rym: It's just.

38
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:43,618
Scott: I was just buying it.

39
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:48,740
Rym: But I'm increasingly like I've gone to board game nights with like my engineers and co-workers.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,397
Rym: And the thing is these people are not that much younger than me like they're in their late 20s.

41
00:02:53,541 --> 00:03:03,079
Rym: And yet the gulf of like knowledge of the history of games among people who are deeply invested in games is Terrifying to me partly because we got that when we got to RIT.

42
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:06,860
Scott: I grew up with the NES and slightly Atari 2600.

43
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,448
Rym: I grew up with Atari 2600, 7800, all 16-bit and then even into the.

44
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:10,812
Scott: you know the end of high school.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:31,176
Scott: There was the N64 and such right and then the PlayStation 2 came out while we were in college, so then Even though I was only in school for you know already in the second third year of RIT People that were only one or two years younger came in and they grew up with PlayStation.

46
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,480
Scott: they somehow did not see.

47
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:36,210
Scott: How did they skip where I saw some Atari 2600?

48
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,640
Scott: How did someone two years younger than me miss ten years?

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,085
Scott: Plus of games?

50
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:43,135
Rym: now that would be fine like I'm not gonna be.

51
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,590
Rym: the old man is like ah kids They don't know shit cuz over.

52
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:49,908
Scott: someone who's like feel that That's wrong for someone who's ten years younger than me.

53
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,537
Scott: I assume that anything older than PlayStation 3.

54
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:52,958
Scott: They don't know.

55
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:55,099
Rym: yep But what bothers me?

56
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,649
Rym: I guess what bothers me isn't so much that Like people younger than me don't know the things I know.

57
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:00,492
Rym: cuz that's expected.

58
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,837
Rym: like that's how the world works.

59
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:02,500
Rym: time advances.

60
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:21,640
Rym: What I didn't expect is how rapidly the memory hole like Devours these things because I know a lot about gaming from before the era I played games and yet most people I encounter Literally know nothing about the era before they started gaming even if they are deeply invested in the hobby.

61
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,791
Scott: Well, I think the thing is even people who even just current knowledge.

62
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:26,533
Scott: right.

63
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:33,559
Scott: there seems to be this huge gap between People who read the internet and people who just do a thing.

64
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,101
Rym: well It's weird.

65
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:36,673
Scott: like there's someone there are people who will go to the store.

66
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,597
Scott: They'll go to GameStop.

67
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:47,131
Scott: They'll buy games They'll take them home and play them and they'll play a lot of games and spend all day playing games and never read a Single video game website or magazine and thus they know nothing.

68
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:55,384
Scott: and whereas I grew up reading Video game magazines basically just ads for video games video game websites So I knew things.

69
00:04:55,805 --> 00:05:01,688
Rym: as I seek out information about things, but the internet II people I meet who are a little younger than us.

70
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:09,254
Rym: they seek out information about new things But they have never like looked into the shroud of the past like they were did.

71
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:17,604
Rym: I overheard some co-workers last week Debating what the first Final Fantasy game was because they weren't sure Final Fantasy one Weren't.

72
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:20,180
Rym: but they weren't sure because like you just went over there.

73
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,751
Scott: Can they just Google what was the first Final Fantasy game?

74
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:23,253
Scott: because that's like.

75
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:26,747
Scott: what happens to me is I don't spend time like Let me go learn about the past.

76
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,694
Scott: I just if I happen to have a question.

77
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:32,004
Scott: Yeah, I google it and Slowly over time.

78
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:35,335
Scott: I remember where to Google to get a thing and also the old one.

79
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:39,028
Scott: when I remember the actual information I just remember where I saw the information.

80
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:50,313
Rym: when I google something like that the generally there's one of two results either There's an answer and now I know or there isn't a clear answer in which case I just found something amazing that I wanted to like track down and figure out.

81
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:52,340
Scott: you go set the Final Fantasy people straight.

82
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:55,740
Rym: Yeah, I literally like stepped into the conference room.

83
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,367
Rym: It was like hi none of you know me.

84
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:08,087
Rym: the first Final Fantasy was Final Fantasy one And it came out on the Nintendo entertainment system in the Famicom, and I walked away before they could react And I just left them in the room.

85
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,674
Scott: and why don't you be like?

86
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:10,860
Scott: I grew up playing that game.

87
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:11,999
Scott: I sold it back to Funko.

88
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:13,115
Rym: No, no what I actually said?

89
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:25,160
Rym: the words I said were like I hate you guys don't know me but what I said was in my professional expertise And I started to just explain to them the history of Final Fantasy and then I left and it was pretty funny.

90
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,530
Rym: But uh yeah, there is some interesting news.

91
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:32,406
Rym: so most of you don't seem to follow the world chess Championships.

92
00:06:32,648 --> 00:06:34,440
Scott: no cuz chess is hella boring.

93
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:44,863
Scott: I would rather watch many sports that I hate and call boring than watch chess which I respect chess players more than some of the athletes Like.

94
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:52,931
Scott: I hate fucking curling right and I respect people who play chess more than I respect people who curl I but I would rather watch the curling.

95
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:54,940
Scott: I'd rather watch curling than I hate fucking.

96
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,029
Rym: I'd rather watch curling than chess.

97
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,419
Rym: I would rather watch chess than soccer.

98
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:02,046
Scott: It depends I.

99
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:07,424
Rym: so I don't watch the chess live cuz I don't care that much No but I had.

100
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:12,804
Rym: I do follow chess because I like to look at the results of games and Step back through.

101
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:13,790
Rym: cuz you get you know this stuff.

102
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,236
Rym: like there's a million chess websites We can look and see like what the fuck happened in this game.

103
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:19,523
Scott: with commentary I don't.

104
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:28,137
Scott: I pay attention to the developments in the chess world Slightly about as much as I pay attention to developments in the go world or the counter-strike world.

105
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:28,819
Scott: yep, right?

106
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,482
Scott: Where's like?

107
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,759
Scott: ah there's a. there's a thing happening, but like I don't follow it.

108
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,306
Rym: So I'm gonna set the stage here.

109
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:38,924
Rym: the thing that's been happening for the last decade or more Is that and we did.

110
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:51,339
Rym: the funny thing is the reason I'm bringing this up is that I've been saying this in lectures and publicly and professionally for like a goddamn decade and I I am being proven right and I'm very happy about this but It happens to me all the time.

111
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:52,423
Rym: Yeah and I'm.

112
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:56,037
Rym: this one is interesting though because math people are backing up my like.

113
00:07:56,057 --> 00:08:01,740
Rym: I Like I didn't know the math and I just made a lot of assumptions about the math and the math is backing me up.

114
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,098
Scott: But basically you know, it's like guessing about P versus anything.

115
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:09,020
Rym: Yeah So here's the deal chess.

116
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:14,020
Rym: Humans are not competitive in chess and haven't been for a long time.

117
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,597
Rym: No Even shitty a eyes are better than any human can possibly be at chess.

118
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:48,739
Scott: usually when people Commentate chess like I was the one chess I did watch a few years ago the last time I paid slightly more attention the commentators are basically the computer would figure out the move and while they were the best move and while they were waiting for Then they would have the computer generate like other possible moves that would also be good yeah, and like top five moves from the computer and then while the person is still thinking on their turn and then they would use The computer's best moves as you know aid in discussing what move the person was going to make.

119
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,000
Rym: Yep So basically humans like cannot compete in chess against even shitty a eyes.

120
00:08:54,341 --> 00:09:01,420
Rym: So human chess as in terms of strategy has diverged a lot from what the a eyes do because that space is still going.

121
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:07,560
Rym: It's AI versus AI and the chess that they play is fucking weird as shit, right?

122
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,619
Scott: But the a lot of people I think at one I don't know.

123
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,280
Scott: This is a while ago years ago that I read that this was happening, but that people were basically learning from the AI.

124
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:21,858
Scott: That's part two intentionally trying to play like them as much as they could.

125
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,813
Rym: so Humans who are trying to be good at chess are studying what the AI's are doing.

126
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,257
Scott: But right this year.

127
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:29,120
Scott: That's many-year-old news.

128
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,760
Rym: Yeah, so the Predicted outcome of this is that like the attractors in chess?

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,197
Rym: Like if you play randomly what is gonna be the result of your actions over time and like skilled players and all this?

130
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:44,799
Rym: but chess probably devolves into a draw in long and play.

131
00:09:44,819 --> 00:10:05,146
Rym: and My evidence for that is not the current math because I don't know it like I'm not a mathematician that ship sailed But because as I studied chess to write GeekNights panels and just my own amusement It seems like most of the rules changes to chess in modern history have been to handle Increasingly complex situations that ended.

132
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:10,220
Rym: draws like draws are the answers right of chess game.

133
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,492
Scott: the only way to fix this is to change the rules of chess itself so that a draw cannot happen and the happen because that would be nothing like chess.

134
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:24,134
Rym: it really looks like Players can force a draw pretty much if they want to which is the endgame of checkers.

135
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:25,839
Rym: Mm-hmm checkers is proven.

136
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,768
Rym: chess It's not proven seems likely.

137
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:39,270
Rym: so humans can study a eyes but they can basically study what the eyes are doing to be able to take a game where they might lose and Guarantee that they'll draw the game to move on to the next game.

138
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,758
Scott: I wonder right so so far checkers.

139
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:44,145
Rym: We've proven There's a soft proof.

140
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:44,988
Rym: There's not a hard proof.

141
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:47,739
Rym: They have not explored every game stage chess looks like it.

142
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,880
Scott: Yes, I wonder is are there any out there any perfect information?

143
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,895
Scott: Games that we've proven like oh, it's a win or a law or anything like that.

144
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,060
Scott: So that way there's a bunch.

145
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:06,875
Scott: Okay, otherwise, they'd be like whoa, maybe all games like this Yeah are draws and we could maybe make a higher level rule.

146
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,260
Scott: So I guess not go.

147
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:10,960
Rym: I don't think has a draw state at the end.

148
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,568
Rym: Checkers definitely both players.

149
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,680
Scott: Oh, we don't know it's way too far out.

150
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,649
Scott: We probably won't live to see.

151
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,960
Rym: the problem with chess Is that the endgame can get into all these loops where the game will be a draw and there's a like.

152
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:25,420
Scott: You move your dude back and forth there move my king back and forth.

153
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,223
Scott: I love that.

154
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,267
Rym: so you can tell.

155
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:30,099
Scott: an elegant provision putting a rule for OSHA like OSHI.

156
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:31,683
Rym: Yeah So they did.

157
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:38,139
Rym: chess has a ton of rules like OSHI to ensure that loops don't happen where a game that's entering a loop state Is a guaranteed draw?

158
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,560
Rym: And I think the only thing human players will be able to do in the future is if they're losing force a draw.

159
00:11:45,041 --> 00:12:00,686
Rym: So the world chess championships that are going right now have had eight crazy epic games that have all ended in draws Mmm, and they can only have four more games that I will bet money will end in draws and after that They're gonna go into sudden death Which will probably end in draws.

160
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:04,320
Scott: so chess people probably mad at me for this and it's probably hella wrong, right?

161
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,197
Scott: Yeah, I want to say it anyway, cuz that's how I do.

162
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:08,988
Scott: So I just gonna admit that it's hella wrong to begin with.

163
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:15,458
Scott: right but usually in my experience my very weak experience playing chess Right, which doesn't even rise to the level of high school.

164
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:18,974
Scott: I'm like Not even high school chess club level right?

165
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:20,280
Scott: It's lower level than that.

166
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,706
Scott: It's nerd who knows how to play chess.

167
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:23,615
Rym: We should play a game of chess against each other.

168
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:24,620
Scott: Yeah, I won.

169
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:25,285
Rym: Yeah, you did.

170
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,799
Rym: we should play one now and livestream it.

171
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,858
Scott: The point is is that at my level of I know how to play chess and that's about it.

172
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:43,626
Scott: Most of the draw stalemate end states involve one player moving their king back and forth So it can't be killed and the other player moving and attacking peas back and forth into it like check You can't kill me check.

173
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:44,108
Scott: You can't kill me.

174
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:52,140
Scott: All right, that's the thing that I have seen personally the most common State event now, I do know that you probably didn't know all the rules for draws.

175
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:54,715
Scott: I have no idea what the rules are, but that's the complex than you think.

176
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:55,460
Scott: I'm sure they are.

177
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,080
Scott: But I'm saying is that that's the most common state that I see and that's definitely a draw right?

178
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:09,871
Scott: Yeah, and but in that situation It's like well the other player who's doing who's moving me say Queen back and forth Also has their King like hiding out in the back somewhere, right?

179
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:12,840
Scott: You know, otherwise they would have lost already, right?

180
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:14,799
Scott: Why don't we define?

181
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,955
Scott: The rules of chess to be like, well look You're the one who's moving your fucking King back and forth.

182
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:23,920
Scott: try not to die And I'm the one who's moving my attacking piece back and forth try to kill.

183
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,525
Scott: Therefore we're gonna define this not as a draw but as I fucking win because you're the one who's hiding and I'm the one who's attacking King back and forth.

184
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:36,156
Rym: doesn't really happen the way you have experienced it in real.

185
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:37,058
Scott: I'm sure it doesn't.

186
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:39,600
Scott: I press Why I preface this by saying I'm probably stupid.

187
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:56,320
Scott: Please correct me people who know more than me, which is anyone who's played in each s. But we could define we could just by definition just change the rules of chess to define some of the stalemate states Where the person who is more defensively positioned in the stalemate loses.

188
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:57,365
Scott: So here's the problem.

189
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:58,952
Scott: is the rule so that no, it's not a stalemate.

190
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:00,720
Scott: Here's the problems because you're on defense.

191
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:03,320
Rym: Here's the simplest problem with that because I don't want to get it like this.

192
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,605
Rym: I don't want to make the show about this.

193
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:08,320
Rym: Yeah, the simplest problem is white already has an advantage.

194
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:12,720
Rym: Yep, if you codify those rules you probably turn chess into a white wins game.

195
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,189
Scott: I mean checkers is a first player wins game.

196
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,433
Rym: So no checkers is a force.

197
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:17,477
Scott: I'm a tic-tac-toe.

198
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:18,260
Scott: I said checkers.

199
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,196
Scott: Yeah, brain had a picture of tic-tac-toe.

200
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:31,758
Rym: That's fine but basically the end result of this is I think the game of chess by the nature of its fundamental rules is Going to be a guaranteed draw game for humans forever.

201
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,874
Rym: good And I said boring game that it'll be a guaranteed draw game for the AI's.

202
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:42,140
Scott: all you people who play chess and are stupid Hella smart and I respect you for being fucking awesome at games.

203
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,797
Scott: Come play real games with us and not stupid fucking chess.

204
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:46,320
Rym: Well, you know what?

205
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,624
Rym: You know the go come play some.

206
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:51,015
Scott: you know, they go people gathering and blow the doors off right.

207
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:56,762
Rym: come play with us and go Right, even though you know, we'll have a similar problem in the sense You need to play.

208
00:14:56,802 --> 00:15:01,360
Scott: go come play fucking settlers and kick the shit out of everyone except when the dice go poorly.

209
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:04,074
Scott: Yeah, come play fucking netrunner come play.

210
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:07,567
Scott: Well, you know Some playing your boring ass chess.

211
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:15,640
Rym: the thing about nerd games and we talk about this a lot in our panels Is that come play 1846 if you play trains if you play nerd games?

212
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:25,180
Rym: Like we play them and you treat them seriously like chess the entire Tournament scene devolves within a year or so and the game is solved and you move on to another game.

213
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:26,168
Scott: Come play NFL.

214
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:27,659
Scott: come be an NFL football coach.

215
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:31,907
Rym: I think the future will be The kind like that's what chess is.

216
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:36,640
Rym: a sport will probably die out in popular like even like chess circles in the long run.

217
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:50,660
Rym: But I think you're gonna see a class of players of games who are the professional board like abstract board gamers that move from game to game to game and when they saw the game To the point of the AI's are better than them and they have like draw state or whatever.

218
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:57,919
Rym: They move on to another game or they do like triathlons of What I try to do, but I get no respect for it.

219
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:02,940
Scott: If I play a boring game like chess, then I get respect, but if I play my nerdy games get no respect.

220
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,400
Rym: The next game is on November 21st, I'm going to on November 22nd see what happened in that game.

221
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:19,700
Rym: I practically guarantee games 9 10 11 and 12 are gonna be draws and then we're gonna go into the Kind of ridiculous and hilarious over time that chest overtime should just be the default mode.

222
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,819
Rym: It's basically just speed chess, right?

223
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:31,236
Scott: Speed chess should be the only chess because if people are playing so perfectly that they can push a draw given all the time to Figure out their moves just give them like 10 seconds per move.

224
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,140
Scott: fucking deal with it.

225
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,447
Scott: You miss a move you lose immediately.

226
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:33,970
Scott: Fuck dude.

227
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:35,880
Rym: You know what the endgame is gonna be like.

228
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:37,840
Rym: It's basically you get like four minutes total.

229
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:47,612
Scott: And right if we can't test who can make if we both players are equally good at making decisions given a minute We'll see who's equally good at making decisions given five seconds.

230
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:49,460
Rym: You know, here's the tiebreaker.

231
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,850
Rym: You just they go to another table.

232
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:52,693
Rym: You got to play.

233
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:53,697
Rym: go against each other now.

234
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:53,999
Rym: Good luck.

235
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,340
Rym: Have fun.

236
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,187
Scott: I hope you know the rules.

237
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:56,256
Scott: just just boxing.

238
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:56,458
Scott: Let's go.

239
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:02,034
Rym: Okay Just boxing is literally what was just suggested in the fall in the chat.

240
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,257
Scott: Just like this is a good sport I'm like, yes.

241
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:11,378
Rym: So in some other news before we get into the bigger news about this about these kinds of games We're gonna do a whole show on this game probably as soon as we play it some more.

242
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,863
Rym: So key Forge has a problem if you're not aware and the problem is talk about this already I don't think so.

243
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:20,214
Rym: Okay, but really briefly there are unfortunately named decks.

244
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,183
Rym: Mm-hmm and The.

245
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:25,780
Rym: basically if you get an unfortunately named deck they filtered out all the bad words.

246
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:31,738
Scott: But there could still theoretically be combinations of normal perfectly normal words that result in bad words.

247
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:41,000
Rym: now honestly 99% of the ones that I've seen that are designated bad are in my opinion fucking hilarious.

248
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:44,800
Rym: Oh, yeah, and I would pay extra for those decks because they're not tournament legal.

249
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:51,026
Scott: What they're doing is if you have a deck that is banned which you can find out by scanning it into the app Yep, because its name is bad.

250
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:52,773
Scott: They will give you two decks.

251
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,118
Scott: You just return the bad one.

252
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:55,904
Rym: Hell no Like.

253
00:17:56,225 --> 00:18:03,720
Scott: but if you're not the erect wang of the forest Playing in tournaments, which I won't then you don't give a shit if your deck is banned or not.

254
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,050
Scott: So if the name is hilarious and not offensive to you Why get the two free decks?

255
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:17,358
Scott: if you got the one awesome hilarious day I want like the the flying boner min of erectile Cove or whatever is gonna come out I would much rather have that deck than the two you're gonna send me with boring names.

256
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:23,420
Rym: Yep And I'm sure there'll be a point in the future where unfortunately named decks will be worth above market price to collectors.

257
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:31,584
Scott: There's already some Stores who are opening the decks like the retailers are buying the game wholesale Opening the decks

258
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:32,246
Rym: sort

259
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:42,240
Scott: of guessing by looking at the deck list like how you know strong the deck is competitively and then Selling them at like an adjusted price that they just randomly decide.

260
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:44,920
Scott: Yeah, like I think this deck is gonna kick some fucking ass.

261
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,460
Scott: I'll try out to see if I can sell it opened for like 70 bucks instead of the normal cover price.

262
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:55,240
Scott: If the name was funny enough like yeah, no, they're not doing it based on the name They're doing it based on the card list which faces outwards.

263
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,325
Rym: Yeah that I wouldn't care about.

264
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:59,120
Rym: but if the name were funny enough that alone would be enough for me to pay extra.

265
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:01,404
Scott: Yeah, I think You know.

266
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,080
Scott: on the one hand it's like well, I guess you can do that.

267
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,453
Scott: But on the other hand, it would be kind of awesome to see the publisher just be like, well We're not selling any products to your store anymore.

268
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:09,916
Scott: Fuck off.

269
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:12,825
Rym: Yeah, I I'm ambivalent on that issue.

270
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,350
Scott: Yeah, that's sort of like whatever.

271
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,453
Rym: Yeah, we'll see what they do.

272
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:15,794
Scott: cuz I'm.

273
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:23,058
Rym: I don't like game retailers Game but there's some news for the other game that we haven't talked about a lot yet on GeekNights.

274
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,100
Scott: artifacts All right.

275
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,008
Scott: So artifact if you don't know is valves.

276
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:34,543
Scott: entry into the card game world is the first new valve game since Dota 2 and as we've said Looks really fun Looks great.

277
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:41,960
Scott: It is also designed by Richard Garfield just like key forges and it is a competitive Collectible card game and it's based on dota.

278
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,577
Scott: But actually that's kind of good because it's sort of like hey, there's like three boards.

279
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,100
Scott: You're managing.

280
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,224
Scott: It's really complex.

281
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:49,072
Scott: It looks like a really fun game.

282
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:51,140
Rym: I got a little bit of Colonel Blotto going on.

283
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Scott: Yeah, I was really hyped to actually play this game until I found out how they were selling the cards.

284
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,792
Scott: We talked about this in GeekNights before.

285
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,268
Scott: I'm pretty sure They're going to sell you.

286
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,520
Scott: you can get in on the game for 20 bucks Which gets you like a starter set full of stuff which like old magic when I was a kid.

287
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,340
Rym: Yeah, 20 bucks would get me like a starter deck in a couple boos, right?

288
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,779
Scott: If you want to buy more cards cost $2 a pack, which is slightly more than Hearthstone cards.

289
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:22,540
Scott: Yep The only other way to get more cards is to play the competitive like drafting mode, right?

290
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:36,160
Scott: But where you like have to use tickets to play in a draft and then if you do well in the draft you could then somehow earn more free drafts and More free draft tickets and also some cards, right?

291
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:40,880
Scott: Or you can buy cards on the secondary market because you can sell cards on the steam marketplace.

292
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,307
Scott: So many copies of a card you can sell them for money.

293
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,414
Scott: that that already.

294
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:47,440
Scott: and then people can buy cards for money.

295
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,830
Scott: Specific cards that nonsense.

296
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,580
Rym: Well, what is wrong with you?

297
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:57,704
Scott: So basically I as soon as I saw this news about how the game we monetize is it nope not touching it all not even Gonna bother playing it.

298
00:20:57,765 --> 00:20:57,946
Scott: Nope.

299
00:20:58,026 --> 00:20:58,167
Scott: Nope.

300
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:00,619
Scott: Nope, because even Hearthstone is sort of like.

301
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:03,272
Scott: well You pay a few hundred dollars a year and you have all the Hearthstone cards.

302
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:06,085
Scott: Yeah, it's a lot of money but it's and it's.

303
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,964
Scott: it's worse than say the netrunner model because the amount of money you have to pay to guarantee getting all the Cards is variable.

304
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:12,048
Rym: Artifact looks fun enough.

305
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:14,640
Rym: I'd pay a hundred bucks a year to just get like all the cards.

306
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:21,230
Scott: Well, I would pay like but if it was if they could just say hey, you're gonna get all the cards I would pay the $20 to get in.

307
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:35,897
Scott: and if I played it a lot and Kept playing it and got way into it and stopped playing other card games because I was playing artifact all the time Then I would I would pay a monthly fee Like 10 15 bucks a month if I just had every artifact card ever and I could play all I wanted.

308
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:42,972
Rym: Chris Rymer points out In the chat, which I was gonna say in a little bit This is basically the bullshit business model of Magic the Gathering online.

309
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,277
Rym: We all know how well that did.

310
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:49,393
Scott: Well MTG Arena Which is a magic online thing has the same business model as Hearthstone.

311
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:51,680
Scott: basically only it's magic cards and it's a worst game.

312
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,098
Scott: but yeah, it's like.

313
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,107
Scott: Now what's the news?

314
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:58,560
Scott: is that basically the thing that I figured out months ago?

315
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,228
Scott: So I didn't bother with artifact.

316
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:02,238
Scott: the artifact open beta opened up.

317
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:17,040
Scott: Yeah, because it was a closed beta all these people got in and realized Oh, the only way I can fucking do anything is either spend money to get cards or Get draft tickets, which cost a dollar each because you buy them in packs of five or five bucks.

318
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,950
Scott: Otherwise, I'm just stuck with the same cards.

319
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,660
Scott: I got for my 20 bucks and I never get any other more cards ever.

320
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,280
Scott: I don't get a single extra card without spending money.

321
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:30,860
Scott: It's like going to an arcade where you put a dollar in the machine and you play and you better win three games.

322
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:33,206
Rym: Meanwhile at least Key Forge.

323
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:36,640
Rym: I can buy a bunch of decks and just play and I'm good to go.

324
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:37,926
Scott: Yeah, well, it's a card.

325
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:39,575
Scott: when you get cardboard for your money.

326
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:41,464
Scott: Yeah, right I guess we'll last.

327
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:43,854
Scott: you could play Key Forge forever even a hundred years from now.

328
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,180
Scott: I mean your cardboard doesn't disintegrate.

329
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:45,642
Scott: There's a.

330
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:51,566
Rym: there is a world where I could praise valve for trying to do a different monetization model But the reality is one.

331
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,413
Scott: they picked the worst possible one.

332
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:53,714
Scott: I don't.

333
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:55,540
Scott: well, they really wanted to use their marketplace.

334
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,980
Rym: Yeah, but the marketplace is the fucking problem, right?

335
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,765
Rym: That is the my whining.

336
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:02,995
Rym: a real money marketplace is like the like.

337
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:05,503
Rym: that is the most harm You can make.

338
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:11,405
Scott: I feel like we should monetization my shitty generic magic clone card game Just like all the rest.

339
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:13,754
Scott: not even bother trying to make a new or interesting game.

340
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:16,324
Rym: Just like Billy and the snake man, too Yeah, just make a game.

341
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:17,187
Scott: just like hearthstone.

342
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,175
Scott: just like magic just like all the other card games.

343
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:20,420
Scott: you put out dudes and they fight.

344
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:29,673
Scott: Just you know mix it up a tiny amount make it slightly unique and just do the business model of you pay a flat fee And have all the cards and that's the only difference between us and the competition.

345
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:32,970
Rym: Oh Wow, I just looked up Billy versus the snake man.

346
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:35,804
Rym: Okay, I Guess it's still around.

347
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:36,667
Rym: I don't know.

348
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:36,928
Rym: All right.

349
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:46,795
Rym: Anyway, I'm not gonna follow that thread any further because it's time for Things of the day.

350
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:47,640
Scott: what he got All right.

351
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:57,315
Scott: So when I was a kid and I was stuck home from school for whatever reason at 11 a.m Eastern time would be the price is right now and watch that shit no matter what cuz.

352
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,880
Scott: it was really great and headless.

353
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:00,531
Rym: It's like a fantastic game show.

354
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:05,772
Scott: lots of old people commercials But really great show really entertaining worth your hour while you eat lunch.

355
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:08,219
Scott: feel good to in between playing video games.

356
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:11,533
Scott: The current host drew Carey not as good as Bob Barker.

357
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:13,240
Scott: Apparently it's been 11 fucking years.

358
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:21,564
Rym: Next you're gonna tell me Craig Kilborn doesn't host the Daily Show anymore, but Still a great show.

359
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:26,097
Scott: still really hasn't changed fundamentally all that much since 1970 whatever.

360
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:35,259
Scott: The only problem is I don't know what anything fucking costs anymore Depends what they put on there, but the problem with the price is right is everything is always MSR P's.

361
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,631
Scott: Yeah, so it's like you're gonna say the price you pay at the store.

362
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,539
Scott: That's way under the actual MSRP.

363
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,459
Scott: Yeah, they use on the price Or anyway, one of the best parts of the price is right is when they spin the wheel twice of the show.

364
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:50,725
Scott: Does he who gets in the showcase but showcase showdown, but you can also just win money on the fucking wheel You get a dollar.

365
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:53,140
Scott: I saw a lot of people get a dollar on this wheel.

366
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:59,642
Scott: It's basically like a one out of what 20 something It's like.

367
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:00,465
Scott: it's like a one.

368
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:02,192
Scott: it is only like 20 something.

369
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:04,260
Scott: slots on there right zero five ten twenty.

370
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,253
Scott: Yeah, it's like twenty one and twenty shot of getting a dollar on there.

371
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:12,535
Scott: and you know with two spins You can add up to a dollar and win that way also, right?

372
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:14,605
Scott: So You got to get.

373
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:19,771
Scott: imagine this show has been played five times a week For how many decades?

374
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:22,566
Rym: Yep, so the odds are You can think of.

375
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:26,140
Scott: eventually there's gonna be a situation where all the contestants get a dollar.

376
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:28,025
Scott: Well, this was a special.

377
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:29,910
Scott: not only did that happen.

378
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,896
Scott: Obviously everyone got a dollar.

379
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:42,238
Scott: This is a special event for the show's anniversary Drew Carey's anniversary or whatever some kind of special event where you could win even more money on the wheel.

380
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:58,889
Scott: and Boy, did they win even more money on the wheel in some, you know crazy luck event Which was again guaranteed to happen because the show's on five days a week with two wheel spinning events per day With six people spinning this 30 times.

381
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,380
Scott: people get to play this wheel spinning game every week forever.

382
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:04,854
Scott: So it's gonna happen eventually and it did so.

383
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:05,196
Scott: there you go.

384
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:05,820
Scott: You can see it happen.

385
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:12,020
Scott: I still we were talking about before the show, but it's funny that it happened during the special extra prize time.

386
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:15,280
Rym: I just I've wanted my whole life to spin that goddamn way.

387
00:26:16,303 --> 00:26:25,180
Scott: It looks like it's kind of heavy right like it has some heft to it But also that it has like, you know It's a well lubricated wheel that keeps going once you get it going with some inertia.

388
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:31,640
Rym: I remember as a kid I watched an episode where this big dude pulls it down and it just kept spinning and spinning and spinning.

389
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:34,040
Scott: The point is I just I just really I just I don't care about winning.

390
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,012
Scott: I don't need to be on the show even though that would be fun.

391
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:37,220
Scott: also, right, you know.

392
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,892
Scott: But the only reason I haven't actually haven't been like.

393
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,736
Scott: if this was in New York and not, California I probably would have gone to be in the audience plenty of time.

394
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:49,593
Scott: Hell, yeah But I just want to feel what it feels like to spin the wheel, you know Just let me have a spin just so I can get a feel for it.

395
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,743
Rym: They should bring the wheel Comic-con.

396
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:54,820
Scott: Yeah, I don't care if like you give me money or I'll even give you like a dollar.

397
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:56,639
Scott: Just let me feel what it feels like to spin the wheel.

398
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:02,560
Rym: I love the fact that even to this day they basically have Drew Carey using a weird like long stick microphone.

399
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,286
Scott: Well, that's the style exactly.

400
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:04,948
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

401
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:06,454
Scott: The show doesn't change but doesn't need to.

402
00:27:07,096 --> 00:27:10,100
Rym: so my thing of the day is It's more of a science II thing.

403
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,320
Rym: But a lot of people have green laser pens or green lasers because green lasers are really cool.

404
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:16,120
Scott: And you know green is the best color.

405
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,483
Rym: Yeah green is the best color.

406
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:21,074
Rym: but y'all know one don't shine lasers in your eye not even red ones.

407
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:26,740
Scott: and two green laser pens are Known to be particularly dangerous much higher frequency than red and blue.

408
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,455
Scott: Well, not necessarily blue but much higher frequency than red.

409
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:38,650
Rym: So a Lot of people because independent of this you can buy a lot of stuff on Amazon these days Anyway, so you can just get.

410
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:44,020
Scott: well you could buy like wood-burning lasers You could buy using craving lasers or all kinds of stuff.

411
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,701
Rym: So the problem here and this video does a really good job of explaining it and it's like really detailed and they show examples and Everything.

412
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:51,363
Rym: but here's the deal.

413
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:57,300
Rym: green laser pens aren't just dangerous because it's green and because it's higher power.

414
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:00,543
Scott: They're extra dangerous because you can see the same way He's not.

415
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:08,440
Scott: ultraviolet ultraviolet rays are way dangerous because they're high frequency But like low frequency infrared waves aren't gonna hurt you bootleg crap.

416
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:16,917
Rym: Oh green lasers generate the green color in a way It also generates a ton of in for a red radiation.

417
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:17,720
Scott: infrared is just heat.

418
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:20,835
Rym: Yeah, I hurt you which will burn the hell out of your eye.

419
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:26,873
Scott: Oh, yeah burn Yeah, but it won't cancer you like an ultraviolet or gamma ray or something, but it'll.

420
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:29,340
Rym: basically it'll blind you way bad.

421
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:33,020
Scott: Yeah, so even the red laser will blind you way bad.

422
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,264
Scott: It's well-made.

423
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:38,420
Rym: red lasers and blue lasers tend to not have this additional danger of the umbrellas.

424
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,374
Scott: There's higher frequency than the green laser.

425
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:41,140
Scott: Wouldn't that burn your eye?

426
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,825
Rym: Oh, they don't dead.

427
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:42,796
Rym: They don't have that infrared.

428
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:47,540
Scott: the problem Don't point any laser at any human's eye unless they're a Nazi in which case hold them down.

429
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,079
Scott: Yeah point lasers at both eyes.

430
00:28:49,220 --> 00:29:18,500
Rym: But the problem basically is that the apparent danger of green lasers is way less than the actual danger Because if you buy a cheap green laser the odds are it generates the laser in a way that also generates tons of super dangerous infrared radiation and This the lens that would block that radiation is definitely bootleg and counterfeit Mmm, and this video shows like how to test your green laser pen to see if it's actually outputting a shit ton of infrared radiation.

431
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:21,959
Scott: You just pointed at your hand and if it feels warm, it's not not enough.

432
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:23,603
Rym: Watch the video.

433
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:24,065
Rym: It's pretty good.

434
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:27,820
Rym: Okay, every question you've had is answered by this video and it's a good video.

435
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,980
Rym: The video is very good goes into great.

436
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:30,797
Scott: I was watching it.

437
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:39,919
Scott: You know if you have questions while you're watching a video and the video that answers the questions that say I was watching a cooking Video today, so I was making chilaquiles and I was like and I was like, where's the egg?

438
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:43,234
Scott: And then he's like, oh I'm gonna fry an egg and I'm like, hello.

439
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:46,712
Scott: I said two seconds I'm like, whoa, he still hasn't gotten any egg in there.

440
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:47,698
Scott: He's like a fry egg now.

441
00:29:48,781 --> 00:29:51,872
Rym: So in the meta moment the booklet book is the space Odyssey.

442
00:29:51,913 --> 00:29:52,635
Rym: we'll read it soon.

443
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:53,338
Rym: we've been busy.

444
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:58,276
Rym: Yeah PAX Unplugged we'll talk about in a minute because our whole shows about PAX Unplugged.

Rym: You must play advanced mode.

447
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,500
Rym: So we'll be there doing two pretty good panels.

448
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:14,875
Rym: Otherwise, we're just gonna be in tabletop playing games going to panels doing stuff.

449
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:15,678
Rym: It's gonna be fun time.

00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:35,067
Scott: Yeah You gotta play games you can.

457
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:36,734
Rym: you only have to be on for it most.

458
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:39,727
Rym: I might be on more without you because I know You tend to not want to be honest many.

459
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:42,280
Scott: I want to get in and play free games and go to your kid.

460
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:48,754
Rym: You will not have to do personally more than four panels Day, I got you think it so at mag fest.

461
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:54,495
Rym: We're gonna do a bunch of panels There's still like the schedules not live yet, obviously TVD, but we will be there.

462
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:55,980
Rym: but it PAX South.

463
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:59,319
Rym: We are going to be doing at least a brand new panel.

464
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:02,693
Rym: Not rare game mechanics, at least not yet.

465
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:03,820
Rym: That's not on the schedule yet.

466
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:06,855
Rym: Then we were probably doing that one at mag fest, but a new one.

467
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:10,740
Rym: We haven't talked about at all Nostalgia versus game design.

468
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:14,620
Rym: Okay, you can guess it what that one's gonna be about and you're probably wrong.

469
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:20,859
Rym: We're gonna make a lot of fun of MOBAs along the way and we're gonna talk about how wind jammers isn't actually that good.

470
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:23,707
Scott: But anyway wind jammers out on the switch now.

471
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:27,319
Rym: Yeah, so wind jammers - we'll see how wind jammers - ends up being.

472
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:28,081
Scott: no It's out.

473
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:29,125
Rym: Yeah, I've played it.

474
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:29,747
Rym: I've touched it.

475
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:30,369
Scott: I think is it?

476
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:33,218
Scott: there is definitely a some wind jammers in the e-shop.

477
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:33,700
Scott: I haven't bought.

478
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:37,933
Rym: So Yeah PAX Unplugged.

479
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:45,178
Rym: we feel Deserves some hype because we've talked we've done GeekNights for so long over a decade.

480
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:45,860
Scott: It's sold out yet.

481
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,720
Scott: No, nope that can you are any days sold out?

482
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:53,880
Rym: Nope, we have done such a big convention center and we're using way more space than we did last year.

483
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,440
Scott: This is like in a major area here, right?

484
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,242
Scott: How could you know?

485
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:59,991
Scott: the east and west are sold out right.

486
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:02,158
Scott: south sort of gets really close to sold out.

487
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:02,600
Rym: almost.

488
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:06,551
Scott: Yep, right, but we can we vote in Philly which for all its awfulness.

489
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:14,938
Scott: maybe people, you know realized awful Philly was yeah But you know as a lot of people living near it and it's like how cut this is a pecs.

490
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,203
Rym: you can just go Aren't you going?

491
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:16,725
Rym: Yep.

492
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:18,975
Rym: So one we've talked a lot like.

493
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:22,670
Rym: if you want to find our advice I'm like how to go to a con how to go to pack like.

494
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,260
Rym: we've talked about that shit for 13 plus years.

495
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:28,936
Rym: But I feel like it's worth it because we haven't done that kind of stuff in a while.

496
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:29,700
Rym: We feel like we did it.

497
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:37,999
Rym: I feel like it's worth it to hype up PAX Unplugged and to sort of approach it Like it's a new convention and talk about like it in that sense.

498
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,710
Rym: So let's dive right in first.

499
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:43,160
Rym: PAX Unplugged is a pecs.

500
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:49,700
Rym: It has all the accoutrement of our regular packs like a compile of it compared to PAX East or PAX West.

501
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:54,756
Scott: The only thing that is not at PAX Unplugged are video games and video game companies.

502
00:32:54,877 --> 00:32:55,098
Scott: Yep.

503
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:58,144
Scott: It has Concert Megathon.

504
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,830
Scott: it's got acquisitions incorporated.

505
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:01,135
Rym: It has an expo hall.

506
00:33:01,537 --> 00:33:02,420
Scott: It has a concert.

507
00:33:02,621 --> 00:33:03,768
Scott: I think it does so.

508
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:07,425
Rym: at least it has main events But generally instead of concert.

509
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:15,639
Rym: so far the main events have been like at a regular packs in main theater You'll see like acquisitions incorporated or like the C team like that kind of stuff.

510
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:20,754
Rym: That'll be the main event during the concert slot at PAX Unplugged.

511
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:25,860
Scott: It's got a keynote which this year So last year the keynote at PAX Unplugged was not very good.

512
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,840
Scott: It was like the CEO of watsy and like it was pretty lame.

513
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,658
Scott: apparently the CEO of watsy is like a marketing guy and he was not the greatest public speaker.

514
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,130
Scott: and Yeah, it was.

515
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,989
Scott: it was disappointing Especially CEO of watsy.

516
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:39,880
Scott: Well again, they went down to the watsy hole.

517
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:46,360
Scott: But this time it is Jeremy Crawford the lead rules designer of D&D and the game's managing editor.

518
00:33:46,480 --> 00:34:01,840
Scott: So in effect the person who is the boss of D&D at the current time game wise You know in terms of like, you know The actual game rules and stuff in the game as opposed to say someone who's managing like, you know marketing of D&D, right?

519
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Scott: Yeah, but so hopefully having an actual game person and not a marketing person to make this much more interesting.

520
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:15,899
Scott: But I still can't deny I'm disappointed that it's another watsy person and another Dude, why can't they go?

521
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:21,080
Rym: Is yeah, right that's who should I call where to come and talk about like fucking weird.

522
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,032
Scott: Yeah, I should be the first person.

523
00:34:23,052 --> 00:34:24,340
Scott: that should have been the first one, right?

524
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:36,875
Scott: But yeah, it's like I wish they would get people from these smaller more indie table towel community Someone who's broadly famous like the very least you think they would have had the what's-his-name.

525
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:39,120
Scott: who did the the Thornwood game for them?

526
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,166
Scott: Whatever Thorn watch game?

527
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,112
Rym: or yeah, really?

528
00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:42,280
Rym: We need to get like mordenkainen.

529
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:48,339
Scott: But it's like you just get anyone who's from the you know, the not watsy.

530
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:53,800
Scott: There's other you know, even another tabletop game company or even a bad one, right?

531
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,657
Scott: It's like there's a guy who run Rio Grande games with that with the the cowboy hat.

532
00:34:57,677 --> 00:34:58,180
Scott: What's his name?

533
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,653
Rym: Oh, yeah, someone like that Just basically someone who can tell a bunch of war stories about the game industry.

534
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:04,159
Rym: that isn't just like marketing for D&D.

535
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,580
Scott: It's like it'd be so easy, but it's like oh they're just going on the watsy hole a second time.

536
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:11,479
Scott: So next year you better get a non watsy person.

537
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:14,029
Rym: Yep I would recommend if you're going to PAX Unplugged.

538
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,153
Scott: I'm still going to this keynote.

539
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:17,160
Rym: Yeah, I go to the keynote every packs.

540
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:18,140
Rym: I will do this forever.

541
00:35:18,341 --> 00:35:24,697
Rym: So the person who's in charge of D&D right now in general while the like a lot of the more recent keynotes haven't been that great.

542
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:27,960
Rym: The majority of the keynotes I've been to have been great.

543
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:29,780
Rym: It's just I've been going to a lot of taxes.

544
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,322
Scott: Did you see?

545
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:33,255
Scott: the D&D just came out with a box set that is.

546
00:35:33,335 --> 00:35:37,653
Scott: I assume it's three books Which I assume must be players handbook DMS guide monster manual.

547
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:39,500
Scott: Yeah, I assume those are the three books.

548
00:35:39,642 --> 00:35:43,392
Scott: I don't know about the other choice They would be but for the new it's obviously for whatever.

549
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,960
Scott: the newest edition is fifth edition, right?

550
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,440
Scott: But they were really nice looking books and a really nice box and I was like man if I played D&D right now.

551
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,525
Scott: Totally buy that dude.

552
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:54,400
Rym: I see I see those books and I just feel like I need to buy them anyway.

553
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,107
Scott: It's a way.

554
00:35:55,168 --> 00:35:56,279
Scott: nice looking box of books

555
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,750
Rym: Also like as much as I look

556
00:35:57,831 --> 00:35:59,482
Scott: it up look for like D&D But as

557
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:11,246
Rym: much as I like my indie RPGs with all my d6 is my bag of d6 is Every now and then I have my dice back out and I see my d8s and my d20s And part of my brain is like Rym.

558
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:12,551
Rym: play some fucking D&D.

559
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:13,013
Rym: Mm-hmm.

560
00:36:13,193 --> 00:36:14,458
Rym: You must if you feel it.

561
00:36:14,498 --> 00:36:17,167
Scott: It's happening alright, so the next thing it PAX Unplugged.

562
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:20,807
Scott: that needs hyping is The key Forge which you talked about a little bit.

563
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:24,240
Scott: Yeah, but basically they're going all out with this game.

564
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,011
Scott: There's gonna be like non-stop tournament events.

565
00:36:27,072 --> 00:36:33,986
Scott: There's gonna be people selling it people demoing it Right, like they're going all in on this game, which is a game We are obviously somewhat excited for.

566
00:36:34,307 --> 00:36:42,780
Scott: so we will definitely be making at least one stop over in the key Forge zone To see what's up probably to just buy the damn game because I order an Amazon and it keeps getting delayed.

567
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,565
Scott: So I might cancel that order and just buy it.

568
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:45,689
Scott: It unplugged.

569
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:49,320
Rym: I doubt I will engage in the tournament scene or serious.

570
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:50,851
Scott: No, no, bye-bye go over there.

571
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:53,346
Scott: I mean literally go Like.

572
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:59,388
Rym: I feel like a bunch of us are gonna play a lot of key for I learned from my netrunner days.

573
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:03,260
Scott: I am NOT going to competitively play any fantasy flight games game.

574
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:04,383
Scott: I am only going to.

575
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:13,871
Scott: just because this one particular game happens to be published by them, but is not designed by anyone there I'm gonna buy one copy of it and play it with people.

576
00:37:13,972 --> 00:37:15,357
Scott: I know according to the rules.

577
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,139
Scott: We know are right.

578
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:29,300
Rym: Well having played like a little bit like having interacted with the game at PAX West I feel it scratches the itch that has been unscratched since I stopped playing magic in middle school.

579
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,931
Rym: Like that ish has been itching like.

580
00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:33,719
Rym: I'm not gonna pretend I haven't been feeling that ish.

581
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,105
Scott: You should have scratched it with some netrunner.

582
00:37:35,326 --> 00:37:37,355
Rym: Nah, the netrunner didn't scratch it.

583
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,339
Scott: All right, it didn't.

584
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:40,847
Scott: Much better game probably better game.

585
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:44,520
Rym: Yeah, it is an objectively better game, but it didn't scratch that itch.

586
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:59,609
Rym: I'm still not a hundred percent sure why It has to be cardboard or doesn't scratch it, okay Nah So I feel like that.

587
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:01,019
Rym: we're gonna do that a lot also.

588
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:15,040
Rym: The tournament scene like the general like tabletop tournaments tournament scene at PAX unplugged is way better than the tabletop Tournament scene at regular PAX is because it is a primary part of PAX unplugged, right?

589
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,364
Scott: So regular PAX is.

590
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,492
Scott: there are tabletop tournaments and quite a few.

591
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:23,369
Scott: they're very substantial but at PAX unplugged It's like it's not a part of the tabletop department.

592
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:30,831
Scott: It's its own department the tournament department and it is big-time Big yep, and also a thing to be aware of.

593
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:33,400
Rym: there is a small number of events at PAX unplugged.

594
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:45,479
Rym: You have to sign up for an advance but they are almost entirely either games where you have to do prep in advance like make a Character to bring or make an army of miniatures and bring

595
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:45,620
Scott: it

596
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:52,818
Rym: Or they are tournaments that need a large number of players where they cannot organize the tournament

597
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,300
Scott: at.

598
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:55,507
Scott: They have these like mega tournaments.

599
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:59,120
Scott: What did they actually call them like the PAX championship series or something like that?

600
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:11,960
Scott: Yeah, it's like these giant enormous tournaments and in order to I don't know if you have to register for them in advance But you can register for them in advance And that is simply because they can't have all that met.

601
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,220
Scott: They have tons and tons of seats for these tournaments, and they could not possibly register everyone on you know on site.

602
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:19,604
Rym: Yep, so this it's.

603
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:24,918
Rym: it's a good thing like I as much as I philosophically am opposed to any pre-convention signups for anything.

604
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:30,940
Rym: there are Limited cases of tabletop where it actually makes perfect sense, and I feel like unplugged doing it right.

605
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:38,019
Rym: So if you want to play like the game where you bring a giant army Check and see if that's something you can sign up for in advance.

606
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:44,824
Scott: But yeah most tournaments at PAX the way it works is you show up the day of you don't can't go a day ahead Of time.

607
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,600
Scott: right because most some people have one day badges.

608
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:53,278
Scott: It won't be fair to them and at 10 a.m When pack starts you go to the signup area and you put your name on the sheet if it's not full.

609
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:54,382
Scott: and now you're in That tournament.

610
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:58,116
Scott: you show up at the time you play in the tournament you try to win.

611
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,063
Scott: if you win you get a PAX medal Congratulations.

612
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:04,460
Scott: some tournaments which are might be run by non packs.

613
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:15,227
Scott: They might be run by vendors or something like that in which case there may be prizes or who-knows-what Or there may be other entry fees But those are not run directly by enforcers.

614
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:24,300
Scott: the main tournaments that are on the schedule unless otherwise noted on there are run by Enforcers and they don't cost anything to enter other than signing up on the piece of paper.

615
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:28,556
Rym: So the omega-thon at PAX is always like a big deal and it's fun.

616
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:32,338
Rym: like if I'm free I will watch omega-thon rounds because they're really entertaining.

617
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:38,360
Rym: yeah But the omega-thon at PAX unplugged they're still like working out exactly what kinds of games.

618
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:39,859
Rym: They're still like figuring stuff out.

619
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:43,417
Scott: But I want to point out wonder if they will use my tumbling dice suggestion.

620
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:48,032
Rym: tumbling die If X custom tumbling dice if you see tumbling.

621
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:51,998
Scott: if you see tumbling dice in the final round of the omega-thon You just know that was all me.

622
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:55,959
Scott: I suggested that one and it was heard by people who are unplugged.

623
00:40:56,341 --> 00:41:00,420
Rym: But what I will say is that it is a full-on omega-thon just like any other packs.

624
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:04,660
Rym: It's worth seeing these rounds, but especially the omega-thon finale.

625
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,347
Rym: We'll talk about that at the end of our little hype show.

626
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:13,712
Rym: but round four of the omega-thon at PAX Unplugged on Friday is blockus.

627
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,963
Rym: Blockus is a game of goddamn skill Blockus.

628
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:20,146
Rym: I'm really.

629
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,333
Rym: I might like go watch this round like this.

630
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:24,860
Scott: I am personally extremely good at blockus.

631
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:32,413
Rym: I too am extremely good at blockus Scott, and I have both studied Classic opening moves and opening strategies to blockus.

632
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:36,026
Scott: I usually beat you a blockus though When was the last time we played blockus?

633
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:38,556
Scott: I can remember the last time I played bot blockus.

634
00:41:38,616 --> 00:41:39,480
Scott: was that a recent packs?

635
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,307
Scott: I can't remember the last time I lost.

636
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:47,766
Rym: oh so the other problem is four player blockus Joey Jojo Shabbat who could fuck it up?

637
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:49,431
Rym: for me mm-hmm two-player.

638
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:52,480
Rym: blockus is a game of such pure anger.

639
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:55,436
Rym: But this omega-thon is gonna be pretty off the hook.

640
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:58,356
Scott: You got a problem.

641
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:00,883
Scott: So let's.

642
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:04,154
Scott: I want to talk about some panels I saw on the schedule that look really hype.

643
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:09,532
Scott: so the first one is CEO panel discussions publishing trends and avoiding mistakes.

644
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:15,659
Scott: right the panelists are Stephen MacArthur a game lawyer from the MacArthur law firm.

645
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,828
Scott: That's a guy's job game on young lawyer.

646
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,700
Scott: Tim fowers the CEO of fowers games.

647
00:42:21,282 --> 00:42:23,693
Scott: Patrick leader owner a creator director of me.

648
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:25,039
Rym: Stephen MacArthur all right.

649
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,000
Scott: well Are you sure I've met him the director of leader games?

650
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,932
Scott: Which is publishes like a root and all that biz right.

651
00:42:31,334 --> 00:42:32,580
Scott: and Scott Gaeta?

652
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,245
Scott: Sorry if I mispronounce your name.

653
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:40,587
Scott: other Scott the president and publisher of renegade game studios Which I've heard of but don't know which games they make.

654
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:43,654
Scott: but that panel looks hella interesting.

655
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:52,400
Scott: that is at Saturday at 10 a.m I'll probably be there And while Rym talks about something I will scroll down until I see the next awesome panel.

656
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:53,058
Rym: So what's cool?

657
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,060
Rym: Is that a lot of the panels that involve publishers in general impacts unplug?

658
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,213
Rym: They lean a little more toward the kinds of panels.

659
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:13,477
Rym: I tend to go to it PAX dev because the thing is PAX dev is interesting and that Most of the people who want to go to pack like who want to engage in the industry stuff like this our tabletop.

660
00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:31,317
Rym: so It's hard for people who are in the tabletop industry to get out to PAX dev because it's really expensive a lot of the tabletop Industries in the East Coast, so I'm seeing a lot of these kinds of panels at pecs unplug that I normally would see it a dev like this CEO panel, and I think that'll be really interesting.

661
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:47,233
Rym: in general I feel like the panel's game at unplugged will be more Specialized to the attendance of pecs unplug because there's a lot more overlap between the people who play Tabletop games and the people who make and publish them than there is in video games.

662
00:43:47,574 --> 00:43:55,560
Scott: so Saturday at 1 there is a FFG Key Forge creating the world's first unique deck game panel, but I'm even though I just talked about hype.

663
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,528
Scott: We were for Key Forge.

664
00:43:56,729 --> 00:43:58,080
Scott: I'm kind of meh on this panel.

665
00:43:58,441 --> 00:43:59,004
Scott: Maybe I'll go.

666
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:02,980
Scott: maybe I won't because Richard Garfield the designer of Key Forge is not on the panel.

667
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:14,142
Scott: Well, probably not at PAX Unplugged either, and it's mostly FFG people And also it's probably mostly gonna be marketing for their game, and maybe not too much good info I don't know.

668
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:16,011
Scott: Maybe I'll watch that one on Twitch afterwards.

669
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:19,242
Scott: if it's on Twitch, maybe Mmm.

670
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:21,009
Scott: That's a maybe panel, so here's the.

671
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:22,133
Rym: here's how you handle this.

672
00:44:22,214 --> 00:44:23,840
Rym: like to be in Pike hype for packs.

673
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,241
Rym: Especially a lot of people go to PAX Unplugged because it's kind of in Philly and easy to get to never been to a pecs before.

674
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:35,410
Rym: here is the absolute best way to decide what panels to go to download the guidebook app on your smartphone or whatever.

675
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:42,150
Rym: and Thursday or Wednesday like before you go to the con or maybe Friday morning while you're waiting for the keynote to start.

676
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:43,635
Rym: Just go through the schedule.

677
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:51,986
Rym: start on Friday scroll all the way down go through Saturday go through Sunday Click on any panel where the title looks even remotely interesting.

678
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:52,929
Scott: Oh, here's a panel.

679
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:54,133
Scott: Saturday It's all the good panels.

680
00:44:54,173 --> 00:44:57,345
Scott: on Saturday Saturday at 6 executive women in tabletop.

681
00:44:57,365 --> 00:44:58,610
Scott: There are six women.

682
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,502
Scott: Right Heather O'Neill Elaine chase cat Tobin Julie.

683
00:45:02,522 --> 00:45:04,710
Scott: I'm not gonna talk about all their jobs are cuz just gonna take too long.

684
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:05,327
Scott: It's a mouthful.

685
00:45:06,692 --> 00:45:07,235
Scott: But it's like.

686
00:45:07,557 --> 00:45:13,461
Scott: these are like six CEOs CEOs Vps of global brand strategy for game companies.

687
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:13,962
Scott: how come?

688
00:45:13,982 --> 00:45:15,326
Scott: none of them is doing the keynote.

689
00:45:15,527 --> 00:45:16,590
Scott: Why are they on this panel?

690
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:22,230
Scott: Instead I mean well they should be on this panel and also do the keynote, but hey go to that panel.

691
00:45:22,572 --> 00:45:24,223
Rym: Yeah, very good, so here's one.

692
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:25,130
Rym: This is a workshop.

693
00:45:26,252 --> 00:45:28,120
Rym: It's a master class in the owlbear.

694
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:37,149
Rym: it is two hours and Everyone's going to learn how to paint a fucking amazing owlbear together, but if I can't even paint like fucking anything like.

695
00:45:37,189 --> 00:45:43,748
Rym: not even It's intended for painters of all skill levels.

696
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:47,846
Rym: Okay, you're and we'll focus on painting feathers and fur.

697
00:45:47,866 --> 00:45:50,569
Rym: oh shit This is gonna go all the way to dry brushing and inking.

698
00:45:51,053 --> 00:45:51,779
Rym: I kind of want to go to.

699
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:52,565
Rym: how long is it?

700
00:45:52,766 --> 00:45:53,230
Rym: two hours?

701
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,003
Scott: You think you can get me to paint an amazing owlbear.

702
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:57,230
Rym: in two hours you will paint.

703
00:45:57,412 --> 00:45:58,383
Rym: I think you know what's gonna happen.

704
00:45:58,403 --> 00:45:59,010
Rym: you're gonna paint.

705
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,550
Scott: It's gonna paint a bear like it's gonna look like that.

706
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,697
Scott: What's that famous one where the Jesus looks all messed up?

707
00:46:03,757 --> 00:46:07,490
Rym: you were going to paint the best possible owlbear you could paint.

708
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:09,458
Rym: That is what will happen.

709
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:10,466
Scott: Maybe I should go to this.

710
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:10,949
Scott: it cost money.

711
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:21,822
Rym: Uh no, I think there's gonna be so last year to register for it on Friday at 9 a.m Cuz it's gonna fill up obviously But that's the kind of shit that happens at PAX Unplugged.

712
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:23,467
Rym: that cannot happen at any other pack.

713
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:31,890
Scott: so at every packs I've ever been to that I can remember Reaper miniatures has had a little paint and take booth Right you basically walk up and for free they give you a mini.

714
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:41,382
Scott: There's like two choices like wizard and some space marine And you take one and you go and they just sit down and there's like a few paints And you paint it and I painted space marine.

715
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:42,406
Scott: finally was it.

716
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:43,290
Scott: I think was packed south.

717
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,417
Scott: I did this space marine.

718
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:46,630
Scott: I finally did it last year at PAX South.

719
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:48,821
Rym: Yeah, I think so I'd pay.

720
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:50,570
Rym: the problem is we go to so many packs as they.

721
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:54,066
Scott: It was packed south last year after all the years.

722
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:54,870
Scott: I wanted to do it.

723
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,264
Scott: I finally did it and that made me so hype.

724
00:46:57,405 --> 00:47:07,710
Scott: I was like oh, man I totally want to like you know not play any minis miniature games like Warhammer But like buy a tiny amount of paint and a tiny amount of minis and paint a few when I'm bored.

725
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:10,037
Scott: So I bought the most basic starter set.

726
00:47:10,057 --> 00:47:11,783
Scott: that's got like a skeleton in it.

727
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:14,070
Rym: cuz skeletons skeletons are going to paint.

728
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,155
Rym: It's all about inking like.

729
00:47:15,215 --> 00:47:16,642
Rym: inking is what makes a skeleton look good,

730
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:29,265
Scott: and I have yet to open Mostly because I it's not that I haven't had a free weekend It's that I haven't I have to find like some sort of material to cover my very expensive tiny table So I don't get paint on it.

731
00:47:30,152 --> 00:47:47,507
Rym: So but basically the way to handle this like I said look through the schedule click on Every panel where the title looks even like minimally interesting and read the description look at the people and if you and Think to yourself answer this one question if I had nothing better to do would I go see this?

732
00:47:47,547 --> 00:47:54,202
Rym: the answer is yes Just add it to your scheduling guidebook And then when you're at the con don't worry about going to all those panels.

733
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:58,175
Rym: like you're gonna have your short list of like the three Things y'all really want to go.

734
00:47:58,235 --> 00:48:01,750
Rym: see but feel all the right just like like everything Adam all to your schedule.

735
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:08,745
Rym: Anytime you're bored just look at your guidebook and see hey What panel is on like next that I said I might want to go to?

736
00:48:09,267 --> 00:48:09,910
Rym: and if you're bored?

737
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,314
Rym: And it's there just go to it.

738
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:18,699
Rym: that is like the best way to maximize your packs because anytime you get downtime You've got like a guaranteed backup thing to go.

739
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:22,290
Scott: do speaking of thorn watch guy, which I remembered his name Mike Selinger.

740
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:28,111
Scott: Yeah, right, and I said he should do the keynote, but here he is doing a panel Sunday Called.

741
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:30,200
Scott: this sounds like a panel.

742
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:30,682
Scott: I would do.

743
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:31,827
Scott: this is a puzzle.

744
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:33,333
Scott: This is a game He's gonna talk about.

745
00:48:33,595 --> 00:48:36,306
Scott: what's a puzzle and what's a game what the difference is?

746
00:48:36,326 --> 00:48:37,511
Rym: I have said I have.

747
00:48:37,893 --> 00:48:43,674
Rym: not only have I seen him give basically that talk at PAX dev multiple times like a talk like it like he's Good talks.

748
00:48:43,694 --> 00:48:50,504
Rym: They're good panels, but - I Had a long conversation where he drunkenly explained this in detail to me.

749
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:50,946
Rym: Mm-hmm.

750
00:48:51,347 --> 00:48:52,130
Scott: It'll be a good panel.

751
00:48:52,553 --> 00:48:53,278
Scott: I'm sure it will be.

752
00:48:53,379 --> 00:48:55,532
Rym: yeah cuz we uh Think about this.

753
00:48:55,633 --> 00:49:01,090
Rym: a lot of these panels are the kinds of things that you'll hear us arguing about in panels.

754
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:08,110
Rym: Just people smarter than us who are deeper in the industry will argue about it with more information than we have.

755
00:49:09,172 --> 00:49:15,924
Scott: Also, I just want to point out you know if you are the kind of person Which is a lot of people who really want to play some RPGs.

756
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:19,860
Scott: usually a lot of people are like hey I want to play D&D, but I never played a D&D before.

757
00:49:20,362 --> 00:49:23,977
Scott: right pack some plugs Is probably the place for you to go.

758
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:33,330
Scott: it's gonna be a lot more accessible than one of those tiny RPG cons in the you know like that's you know usually like a uber con or something if that still exists.

759
00:49:34,512 --> 00:49:38,008
Scott: And it's probably gonna be a lot less crowded than trying to play D&D like a PAX East.

760
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:40,319
Scott: yeah Yeah, this basically if you look at the schedule.

761
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:50,784
Scott: There's like D&D Adventurers League Pathfinder Society all this stuff is basically happening Constantly even other RPGs that are lesser-known that you might be more interested in.

762
00:49:50,804 --> 00:49:52,248
Scott: yeah all over the fuck is.

763
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:53,893
Scott: I see some Star Wars RPG.

764
00:49:54,053 --> 00:50:01,062
Scott: if you want to get your RPG on the danger room LARP by mystic realms whatever the hell that is sound Maybe it's based on the x-men danger room.

765
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:01,585
Scott: I don't know.

766
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:09,710
Rym: I just want to point out Sunday morning if you want to win a PAX tournament guys there is a 16 player single elimination.

767
00:50:10,053 --> 00:50:11,003
Rym: Connect for tournament.

768
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:13,619
Rym: oh, baby Or is a sold fucking game.

769
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,065
Scott: if you go you can.

770
00:50:15,165 --> 00:50:16,190
Scott: you can start right now?

771
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:21,050
Scott: Go online and learn how to be perfect at connect for it won't take you very long.

772
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:23,010
Scott: Practice it a few times against your friends.

773
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,561
Scott: yep practice by playing it online against an AI.

774
00:50:25,762 --> 00:50:26,767
Rym: learn the backups.

775
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:39,390
Rym: learn the Guaranteed strat and learn the backup strat if you're the wrong player right and then basically you will Probably face in the final someone else who did the same thing yep, and then it'll come down to do you go first or second?

776
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:44,775
Scott: Yep, but anyway, that's that's an easy easy win of a PAX medal yep But there's.

777
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:45,942
Rym: this is a good schedule like it.

778
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:47,130
Rym: There's good stuff in here.

779
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:54,369
Scott: I also want to point out again also if none of those RPGs are interesting to you Or maybe they're not at a good time on your schedule.

780
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,240
Scott: RPGs games on demand is gonna be there.

781
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:03,242
Scott: what this is if you don't know what they're at many Pax's as well as other conventions is a little booth or an area.

782
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:08,088
Scott: you go there with your friends or maybe you meet up with some strangers there who knows?

783
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:10,554
Scott: and There's RPGs there.

784
00:51:10,574 --> 00:51:18,310
Scott: there are GM's just waiting for players and as soon as I did this one year at PAX West I GM like three or four RPGs in the games on demand area.

785
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:20,665
Scott: Oh, and you just wait when I was a GM.

786
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:25,165
Scott: I just went there I waited I put up these little cards, and it was like a menu.

787
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:33,957
Scott: players came up They looked at the menu And they were like they wanted to play an RPG right then there and now as soon as there were enough people I brought them over to a table.

788
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,390
Scott: I ran a one-shot RPG session.

789
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:49,281
Scott: I set them on their way and even though I thought only maybe one and a half of those sessions was good I got excellent feedback in all the sessions, so if you want to play RPG Telling you PAX Unplugged you cannot miss.

790
00:51:49,763 --> 00:51:50,466
Scott: This is your chance.

791
00:51:50,486 --> 00:51:52,774
Scott: all those you're like oh, man I never get to play RPG.

792
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:54,800
Scott: I watch RPG on Twitch.

793
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:58,050
Scott: I watch acquisitions incorporated, but I got no friends.

794
00:51:58,312 --> 00:51:59,323
Scott: Yeah, I can't.

795
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:02,219
Scott: I have friends But I can't get them together because they're all busy.

796
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,579
Rym: all the people who are obsessed with the C team are Here in the same building with you.

797
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:15,044
Scott: you can go to PAX Unplugged for three days And if you really want to you could probably play two or three RPG a day if you really dedicated all your time to that and nothing else.

798
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:17,728
Scott: and that is not a bad way to spend the PAX Unplugged yep.

799
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:27,341
Rym: So in terms of to like LFG like all packs is have like a looking for game area and tabletop PAX Unplugged has a fucking looking for game area.

800
00:52:27,382 --> 00:52:33,060
Rym: like if you want to no matter what weird like Train game nonsense you want to play.

801
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:38,743
Rym: if you LFG it unplugged You're all practically guaranteed to find other people who will play this game with you.

802
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:45,308
Scott: and even if those people are That guy it's packs, so they're not allowed to be that guy.

803
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:50,434
Scott: yep You can always get some enforcers and be like yo We got a that guy over here And they'll get taken care of.

804
00:52:50,475 --> 00:52:51,618
Scott: you can be rest assured.

805
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:55,230
Scott: the worst you'll have to deal with is slightly.

806
00:52:56,435 --> 00:53:01,080
Scott: And let me tell you wants to play shit geek but won't be bad because it's PAX Unplugged.

807
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:02,426
Rym: is the tabletop focused one?

808
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:12,477
Rym: the Enforcers at PAX Unplugged even more so than other packs is are on top of that guy Like they are crack.

809
00:53:12,517 --> 00:53:15,186
Rym: They're a crack team to make sure that guy doesn't.

810
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:26,056
Rym: that guy all over you Let's see there's a kids room in a family room like Sunday is a kids day like you can bring your kid if they're under 12 For free on Sunday.

811
00:53:26,256 --> 00:53:31,814
Rym: Oh, baby, and there is a big area because pax's are Family-friendly.

812
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:36,770
Rym: if you're a family that says fuck casually like that's how pax is like it's family-friendly.

813
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:41,165
Rym: But it has to be this like cool dad that lets the kids say fuck when they're not at school.

814
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:43,950
Rym: There is a specifically

815
00:53:45,275 --> 00:53:55,810
Scott: I think there was a dad who had like it let his kid that they're listening to GeekNights in the car And he was like he's like yeah I just got to tell my kid not to say words that you're saying and I'm like I don't think you've learned the lesson of GeekNights.

816
00:53:55,991 --> 00:54:06,030
Scott: You should have a cool kid who says fuck like he's from, New York But the kid who's smart enough to not say fuck in front of his middle school teacher or to say fuck you middle school teacher Just a fucking word.

817
00:54:07,292 --> 00:54:12,590
Rym: But there is a family room that has miniature painting and games and is the fuck like the fuck free zone.

818
00:54:13,152 --> 00:54:17,365
Rym: So like pegs unplugged is more family and kid friendly than a general packs.

819
00:54:17,907 --> 00:54:18,930
Rym: that is like worth noting.

820
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:20,142
Rym: It's kind of a. it's a cool thing.

821
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:20,849
Rym: I'm glad they do it.

822
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:25,889
Rym: The pain like all the pack stuff like the pin trading is there's just there.

823
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,058
Rym: Tabletop is so big.

824
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:41,129
Rym: there's like oh, so if you haven't been to a packs recently There's a new thing in tabletop called first look mm-hmm Started at last PAX Unplugged But it has reappeared at every packs all year and it'll be at every packs forever.

825
00:54:41,149 --> 00:54:41,771
Scott: first Look.

826
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:49,649
Rym: the deal if you don't know is it's not like regular tabletop where there's like an area where everyone plays Carcassonne Not an area where you play whatever.

827
00:54:50,172 --> 00:55:00,690
Scott: it's an area where there are games already set up with the rules sitting there and Enforcers who have tried to spend as much time as they could learning the rules so that they could teach anyone who walks up.

828
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:04,950
Rym: So you can go into this area see a game that is not out yet or not out.

829
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:20,330
Scott: We had expert enforcers go to S in BGG con and all these other board game events that are conveniently scheduled right before PAX Unplugged To collect the newest and hottest board games that are unavailable still in the United States or hard to obtain.

830
00:55:20,772 --> 00:55:25,049
Scott: Bring them here to teach them to you, so you can have the first look at them.

831
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:42,870
Rym: It's really great and amazing to just sit down at some brand new game and have an enforcer Expertly teach you and a bunch of other people how to play it and then be available answer questions While you play it and when you're done playing it walk away from the table and the game is set up for the next group

832
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:43,271
Scott: of people.

833
00:55:43,331 --> 00:55:50,978
Scott: the only thing I can tell you though is that the first look area at PAX Unplugged as hard as there's a line is Very crowded because a lot of people.

834
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:52,063
Scott: so the real secret.

835
00:55:52,123 --> 00:55:53,630
Scott: you got to go to the first look area.

836
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,630
Scott: I packed south and literally any other packs, but PAX South it is the least crowded.

837
00:55:57,841 --> 00:56:00,713
Rym: Yeah PAX South is like the Secret packs on.

838
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:00,994
Rym: you'll

839
00:56:01,014 --> 00:56:17,627
Scott: get the same exact first look area and the same exact tabletop library that was at PAX Unplugged But they'll be fucking like almost no one else playing games there But the same enforcers learning and teaching the same games the same everything and now you can play those games Just to your heart's content without having to wait whereas it PAX Unplugged.

840
00:56:17,647 --> 00:56:22,068
Scott: you'd be like oh, man I really want to play that that meeple circus that was in the first look last year.

841
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:22,410
Scott: right yep.

842
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:24,136
Scott: And meanwhile someone's playing it.

843
00:56:24,156 --> 00:56:27,930
Scott: so you walk away and come back someone else is playing it walk away coming someone's playing it PAX Unplugged.

844
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,422
Scott: It's just sitting there waiting for you to come and enjoy the circus.

845
00:56:31,924 --> 00:56:38,970
Rym: and one last thing that's interesting about PAX Unplugged Is that you know Mike and Jerry are both like around and other packs is kind of equally and they hide and whatever.

846
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:49,350
Rym: But if your PAX Unplugged is kind of like the Jerry attacks Like Mike will be doing like a storm watch stuff and Jerry's just like wandering around all the time like playing games with people.

847
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,092
Rym: He's more accessible than he is at other packs is.

848
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:59,194
Rym: so if your jam is to like be adjacent to that dude while you play a game like unplugged is the one to go to if you care about that sort of thing.

849
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:13,570
Rym: and last and least If you are a fan of us already You don't need to go to our 40 tabletop games You must play panel because one it's gonna be on YouTube and two it's 80% the same as the one that's already on YouTube.

850
00:57:14,252 --> 00:57:17,803
Rym: We're doing it at PAX Unplugged because one it's gonna be a live streaming.

851
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:29,962
Rym: because that kind of panel like gaming comms that aren't packs don't really have good panels and tabletop gaming comms that aren't packs Really don't have the concept of panels by and large.

852
00:57:30,504 --> 00:57:32,069
Rym: so we're doing this for people who aren't you.

853
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,741
Rym: But it's probably worth going to our learning when.

854
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:46,741
Rym: Puerto Rico if you don't know how to play Puerto Rico Because we're literally gonna be in the room for a couple hours like helping you all play Puerto Rico Like not just the panel even if you just watch it on YouTube It's not the same.

855
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:57,015
Rym: if you're in the room You can like ask us what to do in a situation right there and we'll be like Pick the captain because it'll totally fuck over that guy and this guy is not gonna beat you Etc.

856
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,365
Rym: like that kind of stuff will happen.

857
00:57:58,547 --> 00:57:58,788
Scott: Mm-hmm.

858
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:03,290
Rym: And if you see us like, you know what other packs is people like, oh, hey, I want to play.

859
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:04,899
Scott: Oh, yeah, this packs of bug just really soon.

860
00:58:04,919 --> 00:58:06,890
Scott: We should probably work on that parent Rico panel.

861
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:09,520
Rym: I'm gonna finish it this like over Thanksgiving.

862
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:09,982
Rym: cuz I'm not going.

863
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:11,328
Rym: I'm not doing shit for Thanksgiving.

864
00:58:11,368 --> 00:58:11,870

895
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:17,993

896
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:21,162

897
00:59:21,263 --> 00:59:23,610

898
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:27,209

899
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:34,210
Scott: Yep, small warehouse plus war main the main strategy is you want to take have to take as few actions as possible, right?

900
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:40,459
Scott: Like if I have to go mayor and then a bunch of nothing happens and then I have to go Alright now I'll do build it right.

901
00:59:40,499 --> 00:59:42,368
Scott: It's like, you know, if I do well, I guess we build her.

902
00:59:42,388 --> 00:59:43,836
Rym: then mayor You want everyone you want to line it up?

903
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:51,803
Scott: So everyone else is taking the actions you need in the order you need so that on your turn You're like you're getting turns ahead of other people.
