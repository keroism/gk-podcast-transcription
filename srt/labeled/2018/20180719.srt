1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,975
Rym: It's Thursday July 19th 2018.

2
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:14,485
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:21,210
Rym: tonight in the GeekNights book club We're talking about Emily Wilson's translation of Homer's the Odyssey.

4
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:25,902
Scott: Not uh, this is the Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:30,150
Rym: So yeah, no news cuz it's the GeekNights book club.

6
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:37,049
Rym: I guess what I should point out is that if you're new to GeekNights We have a book club and we've been doing this for a long time.

7
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:43,198
Scott: So even though it takes a long-ass time for us to read a book If it doesn't you take a long time to read the book.

8
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,909
Scott: It just we don't spend enough time reading.

9
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:48,089
Rym: Yep, partly cuz we had a lot going on.

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,907
Scott: We probably only took me like maybe less than 10 hours to read this book in total.

11
00:00:53,128 --> 00:01:02,781
Scott: Yep But it just those 10 hours just spread out over many many months at least Three at least six maybe.

12
00:01:03,283 --> 00:01:05,150
Rym: but anyway the deal we're gonna get right into it.

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,698
Rym: We're gonna have things today, but we're gonna get right into this book club.

14
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:09,584
Rym: Is that we're not?

15
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:17,630
Rym: we're assuming you read the book Meaning we're not going to explain the plot to you and we're gonna casually spoil everything.

16
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,803
Scott: Granted I feel like I don't feel like you can spoil the Odyssey.

17
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:21,426
Rym: Yeah, guess what?

18
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:22,209
Rym: He makes it home.

19
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:31,428
Scott: I mean if you don't know the story of the Odyssey, even if you never read the Odyssey I feel like I knew the story of it the general story Before even reading the pop-up book.

20
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:42,330
Scott: Yeah Partly because the word I learned I learned the story of the Odyssey from other things That I watched in my child or read my childhood and then I didn't read the Odyssey.

21
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:46,933
Scott: There was a multi-part DuckTales Episode I had in VHS.

22
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,241
Scott: Yeah, that was the Odyssey.

23
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,124
Scott: There was.

24
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:51,669
Scott: what else was the Odyssey?

25
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:52,814
Scott: That's the one I remember the most.

26
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:54,784
Scott: but there was I think I read.

27
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:59,765
Scott: you know, there's like a children's Video one of those like story books that you see at the library.

28
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:00,710
Scott: that hardly moves.

29
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:04,324
Rym: You've got that awesome pop-up book that you got a mocha a long time ago the Odyssey.

30
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,730
Rym: Well, that's you know.

31
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:06,749
Rym: I mean that was more recent.

32
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:14,618
Rym: I didn't actually read the Odyssey like for real until ninth grade because in my high school Ninth grade was the year you did Greek literature.

33
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:20,320
Rym: So you did the Odyssey and all that like all the tragedies and all that stuff.

34
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:29,039
Rym: Mm-hmm and We didn't actually read all of the Odyssey and I wasn't really realized that till I read the Odyssey again later There was only mythology in our school.

35
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,798
Scott: if you elected mythology in high school And I think then they made you read a whole bunch of mythology.

36
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,302
Scott: I did not elect that.

37
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:39,968
Scott: I elected science fiction and also hippie anti-war book.

38
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:46,650
Rym: Mythology was its own thing, but the Odyssey in Greek literature was not opt-outable.

39
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:54,297
Rym: That was core like even even the dumb side of the school like the regular basic class English It was still Greek stuff the snooty.

40
00:02:54,578 --> 00:03:03,639
Scott: basically there were three literature electives for snooty smart kids and I chose none of them which is Shakespeare Mythology and Mark Twain type action.

41
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:04,843
Scott: I just none of those three.

42
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:05,727
Scott: I chose all the other ones.

43
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,234
Rym: at RIT I just tested out of everything except the one class I couldn't test out of.

44
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:11,565
Rym: yeah where I had to read that tear all those terrible books.

45
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:12,590
Rym: tree of red stars.

46
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:15,812
Rym: Yep, we will never do a book club book on the tree of red stars I promise.

47
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:18,281
Rym: why would we guess we should warn people against it?

48
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:20,610
Rym: anyway three stars run away.

49
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:27,760
Scott: So the point is that you know we know the Odyssey, but this is a new translation of the Odyssey And you know I've never read any other translation of the Odyssey.

50
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,410
Scott: that wasn't some simplified children's or pop-up book.

51
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:33,385
Scott: I've never read and you know I've read some other.

52
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:46,070
Rym: I've read I've mostly read in high school one translation I don't know which one it was in our textbook, and I fully read a different translation I'm pretty sure was a penguin book, but I don't know anything about it.

53
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,930
Scott: We're not a lot of them.

54
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:54,909
Scott: It's like there's like four different ones than Amazon And you don't know which one's good, but I'd never read a modern or modernized translation until this mm-hmm.

55
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:59,444
Rym: But again really like we're going to assume you read the book.

56
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:02,870
Rym: you can continue to listen to this episode If you didn't read the Odyssey.

57
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:14,610
Rym: But that's like when you're at a convention or at a party and you're hanging out on the outside of the circle of people talking About something and you have no idea what they're talking about and you're just standing there kind of nodding along.

58
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,286
Rym: You really don't want to be that guy.

59
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:17,754
Scott: Rym is that guy?

60
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:19,882
Scott: no I usually know what's going on right.

61
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:34,928
Scott: the other thing is to talk about this book Right is kind of hard because I feel like the introduction and also the notes at the end Sort of say everything there is that I could possibly say and I don't have any special knowledge about.

62
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:38,699
Scott: you know Greek history literature Homer or anything.

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,481
Scott: so it's like.

64
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:41,386
Scott: what can I say other than reiterate?

65
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:42,710
Scott: What was already in there?

66
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:46,923
Scott: Right it's like there's already these people who study this for a fucking living.

67
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:48,749
Scott: What do I have to contribute?

68
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,010
Rym: well?

69
00:04:49,230 --> 00:05:00,070
Rym: That's why rather than talk about the forward which if you read this book and didn't read the forward the forward What the forward is the what you're paying for the forward taught me a lot about the Odyssey?

70
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,797
Rym: Oh, yeah, and it also reinforces something that a lot of people don't seem to realize that when people say Greek They always think like Athens and Sparta.

71
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,790
Rym: that is way way late Greece.

72
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:16,623
Rym: There's a lot of Greek and quote-unquote Greek history before that.

73
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:20,274
Scott: yeah, Homer comes way before say Euclid.

74
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:25,887
Rym: yeah, right Homer comes way before Athens and Sparta as you would know them.

75
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,941
Scott: yeah I mean they still the you know like Sparta.

76
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:30,246
Scott: they mentioned Sparta in the book.

77
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:30,909
Scott: right it exists.

78
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:38,189
Rym: yeah But the Sparta of 300 was far far away and arguably they might not even be the same thing.

79
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:43,398
Rym: yep They could just have the same name because you know there was the Dorian invasion Which may or may not have been an actual.

80
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:46,176
Scott: and being Homer they're talking about mice And I like.

81
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:52,110
Scott: it's a present thing mice And I is like the ancient Greek civilization that was lost and we don't know enough about yep.

82
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:56,430
Scott: You want to have a good honor, but that was present to Homer's writings.

83
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:58,118
Rym: You want to go down a rabbit hole.

84
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:06,750
Scott: go read about the Greek Dark Age cuz I realize Like what BC number are we talking about here with you know when Homer was supposedly possibly writing the Odyssey?

85
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:11,010
Rym: Like we're talking like literal way if the Trojan War happened like that.

86
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:17,837
Rym: So imagine raw on a super rough scale cuz I'm not I don't know that much about currency current.

87
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:25,326
Rym: the Greece that you think of like Sparta Athens Marathon like and after that is Alexander like on a really broad stroke a great one.

88
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:29,507
Rym: so before The Athens Sparta stuff not not not Wayne.

89
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:32,116
Rym: the great one Is the Greek dark.

90
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:38,724
Rym: effectively the Greek dark a like archaic Greece the Dark Age and then before that is the Homer era.

91
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:43,503
Rym: But yeah, we're not gonna try to get in Greek chronology.

92
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:47,514
Scott: the sack of Troy was dated to 1184 BC.

93
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:50,545
Rym: that's a long time before the Battle of Marathon.

94
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:58,269
Scott: That's that's like Less than half the distance between us and Jesus who didn't exist.

95
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:03,035
Scott: The Battle of Marathon the one on the other side the Battle of Marathon Which is what most peep.

96
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:05,770
Rym: that era is what most people think of when they think of ancient Greece.

97
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:14,792
Rym: They're actually I think most people think of like classical Greece like Roman Greece But anyway, or like all those like way later eras was 490 BC Mm-hmm.

98
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:22,475
Rym: so the stuff you think about it from 490 BC is not the same years so it's as old.

99
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:26,104
Scott: it's basically the distance between us and the medieval times.

100
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:30,218
Scott: is the distance between Homer and The Greece years they normally think.

101
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:40,658
Rym: but before we get into that we do have Things of the day.

102
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:44,708
Scott: you just forgot to do things of the day now And you started book clubbing.

103
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,250
Rym: no I was doing a pre moment about the book club because we haven't done one in a while.

104
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:57,671
Rym: And I want to remind people that we have a book club And you should just go look at the old episodes and if a book looks good read it and then listen to our show about It.

105
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,455
Rym: you should read books.

106
00:07:58,515 --> 00:07:59,861
Scott: if you want to be an intelligent person.

107
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,970
Scott: if you come up to me and say I am a person who?

108
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,121
Scott: Does not read books that consist only of words doesn't matter.

109
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:07,830
Scott: if they're e or paper audiobooks don't count for me at least.

110
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,703
Scott: But if you're a person who does not read books my respect for you is diminished.

111
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:15,895
Scott: you are below other humans on the respect Ometer compared to humans who do read.

112
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:18,723
Rym: so my thing of the day is this video.

113
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:19,766
Rym: SV nation is pretty good.

114
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:34,230
Rym: videos about like sports History and sports faz fun stuff and this one is about Tom Dempsey if you don't know Held the record for the longest field goal in his in football history for 43 years and so people knew how to kick.

115
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:38,130
Rym: Well, it wasn't just until people know how to kick stuff changed and technology change.

116
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,403
Rym: There's a lot of things that changed also steroids more of a thing like.

117
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:43,184
Rym: there's lots of things.

118
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:43,988
Scott: I don't think kickers.

119
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,693
Rym: They're on steroids Wouldn't be surprised.

120
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:47,495
Scott: They don't use it.

121
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:52,347
Scott: the kicker is usually the tiniest tiniest people with one big like trogdor looking leg.

122
00:08:52,367 --> 00:09:04,824
Rym: yeah But Anyway the deal with Tom Dempsey was that he was so good That they made a rule to basically prevent anyone else from ever kicking like him.

123
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:16,541
Rym: and the reason he kicked the way he did is Because he was literally missing half of his foot and his foot was basically a club That he used to great effect with terrifying power.

124
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:25,468
Rym: and the NFL literally made a rule that Specifically prevented anyone from ever doing what he did ever again, and it's just a pretty interesting story.

125
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:26,693
Rym: hmm So what do you got?

126
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:29,630
Scott: so as it would have been a Monday thing of the day?

127
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,370
Scott: But whatever I don't even know if this is real cuz I didn't try it for myself.

128
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,180
Scott: This could be like a scam website.

129
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,527
Scott: That's like fooling you into thinking.

130
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,030
Scott: This is real.

131
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,710
Rym: That'd be really funny if it is but yeah.

132
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,587
Scott: So one thing people in the way who work in the web always talk about is links.

133
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:43,494
Scott: Ella why?

134
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:44,035
Scott: and X?

135
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:48,570
Rym: there's also another one Li and clearly in the context of you made a modern website.

136
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:50,580
Rym: But will it work on links right?

137
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,349
Rym: so look at how long my neckbeard is.

138
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,222
Scott: Links is a web browser that runs in the terminal and is like only text.

139
00:09:56,322 --> 00:10:12,395
Scott: so it's sort of like if you make your website Good and accessible enough and and adaptable enough someone should be able to use your website Fully from links in the terminal with text only and it's sort of like a litmus test But sort of a bullshit one.

140
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:16,911
Rym: Yeah, I'd say it was a legitimate litmus test until about 2002.

141
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:20,385
Scott: Yeah, it had its day, but it's like no one does no one using links.

142
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:21,289
Scott: Maybe there's one guy.

143
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:27,747
Scott: The point is it's a way to browse the web from the terminal and it works.

144
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:31,948
Scott: even today it works yeah, but in some web pages it works better than others.

145
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:35,619
Scott: and What someone here did is they made a thing?

146
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,382
Scott: What's it called?

147
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,248
Rym: It is called browshe browshe.

148
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:45,570
Scott: For I guess it stands for browser shell or shell browser And it's basically a web browser that runs in the terminal.

149
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:54,974
Scott: But it takes advantage of all the features of modern terminals and modern computers not which are things like color Right links and links.

150
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:57,662
Scott: the you know both spellings are two different texts.

151
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,647
Scott: right they can run on like a VT 100 in the work.

152
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,310
Scott: Right that's one of those old term like hardware terminals.

153
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,895
Scott: They just got a green screen right.

154
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:15,890
Scott: but browshe can run in say gnome terminal or x-term or rx-vt Or the I term on your Mac, and you know all the modern terminal emulators that you're running on your real computer.

155
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:25,490
Scott: That's made in the 2000s Like a VT hundred that has colors and sounds and you have a mouse and all these sorts of assumptions and scroll wheel.

156
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:32,296
Scott: So it basically uses all those modern features of your browser to render a web page Just like a real web page.

157
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,463
Scott: the thing is the resolution is just really low.

158
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:38,256
Rym: it is the resolution the pixels on anything that is Not text because it's all icons.

159
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:39,984
Rym: Yeah, it's all icons in a pixel grid.

160
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:48,004
Rym: the well in a grid Not a pixel grid the pixels and the images are each Exactly the size of a tile that would have a character in it like a letter.

161
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:49,951
Scott: yep, so but yeah It's.

162
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:54,685
Scott: you can even watch video in it look at images click on links read tags.

163
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,510
Scott: It's like it's a full-on web browser.

164
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:57,121
Rym: What's really?

165
00:11:57,162 --> 00:11:57,550
Rym: what's really?

166
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,841
Scott: Anyone who knows how to use a web browser could use this.

167
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,910
Scott: it would just look really pixely.

168
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,950
Rym: What's really weirding me out is just scroll like looking at these images.

169
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:11,110
Rym: They look so much like the resolution you got in old PC games like police quests.

170
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,862
Rym: Yeah, that is giving me a weird nostalgia for games like police quest.

171
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:16,025
Scott: it would be like if you ran.

172
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:26,087
Scott: it feels almost like you ran actual chrome But on DOS and the resolution of the screen was still 320 by whatever the fuck.

173
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:30,149
Scott: it was an old DOS Yeah, but your CPU is strong enough, and it actually just kind of worked.

174
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:36,793
Scott: But you didn't have any advanced GPU and your resolution was still 320 by whatever with 256 colors.

175
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:42,352
Rym: got in the DOS era I had a monitor that was 12 inches and it its max resolution Was 800 by 600.

176
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:42,955
Rym: I think we had a 15 each.

177
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,856
Rym: No, I didn't have that.

178
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:51,870
Rym: but then I had that giant 19-inch super CRT that I brought to RIT.

179
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:53,719
Scott: Yeah, I brought it to RIT a 17-inch.

180
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,161
Scott: yep that 19-inch.

181
00:12:56,372 --> 00:13:00,135
Rym: That was one of the the only thing I've had to move in my life That was harder than moving.

182
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:05,906
Scott: that monitor was the fucker that couch And then the people who took away that fucker just took it away.

183
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:06,449
Scott: one two three whoop.

184
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,839
Rym: I was really saddened by that.

185
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:13,744
Rym: they had no problem movement, so yeah in the meta moment whatever We're gonna be at PAX West the real PAX.

186
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:14,589
Rym: We're doing a panel.

187
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:20,730
Rym: It's not only going to be live at PAX on Monday But it's going to be live streamed on the official PAX twitch.

188
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:24,950
Scott: So if you don't go to PAX I don't know which one of them they think there might be two or three official.

189
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:28,161
Rym: It will be probably packs two or packs three.

190
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,590
Rym: as soon as we know we will let you know.

191
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:42,345
Scott: We'll probably tweet when it's starting - yeah I will probably schedule all those tweets well in advance if I follow GeekNights on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and all the different social places because we have accounts there.

192
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:47,783
Rym: also if you're listening to this podcast You could actually watch us record it live on YouTube.

193
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,950
Rym: There are currently five people watching.

194
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:55,250
Scott: I mean I would already discourage you from listening to this podcast saying you could not worth your time to listen to this podcast.

195
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:58,801
Scott: It's even less worth your time to watch the podcast being recorded live.

196
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:00,326
Rym: I'm just saying you could.

197
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:01,350
Rym: I didn't say you should.

198
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:05,126
Rym: And also we just did another judge anime by its cover.

199
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:09,903
Rym: that video is up And it's on Scott's YouTube and a lot of you only follow my YouTube.

200
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,150
Rym: You should also follow Scott's YouTube.

201
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:18,087
Scott: Start some project of great evil possibly on my YouTube soon.

202
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,597
Rym: Oh is this one I know about or is this a new evil.

203
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:22,909
Scott: I told it to you recently.

204
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:24,959
Rym: okay I think I know what you're talking anyway a lot.

205
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,843
Rym: if you do that evil.

206
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:26,405
Rym: It'll be great.

207
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:30,378
Rym: so We're not gonna try to analyze the Odyssey.

208
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,966
Rym: I think you're gonna mention that there's nothing we can say.

209
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:40,370
Rym: well anything I could say would either be me Basically poorly reiterating things I learned in high school.

210
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,630
Scott: I feel like if you write a book about physics and then tried to say things about physics.

211
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,818
Scott: It's like but more importantly like qualified.

212
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:47,621
Scott: We're consumers.

213
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:47,962
Scott: We're not.

214
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:52,479
Rym: you know it depends on what the book is like The ear the eye the arm.

215
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,330
Rym: there aren't a lot of book clubs that talked about it.

216
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,130
Rym: So we tried to analyze its themes and do like some serious Likrit.

217
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:03,970
Rym: but I don't really want to bother with that with the Odyssey because The Odyssey is one of the most studied stories in human history.

218
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:13,068
Rym: You can read way smarter people than us, so I want to approach this talking about This translation and like it how it worked

219
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:13,410
Scott: for us

220
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:22,189
Rym: And more importantly I also want to talk about The story at face value as we read it like as though We just read this book and it had no history.

221
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:23,915
Rym: But I'm not gonna try to read into it.

222
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:29,319
Rym: you can go read the debate over whether or not Odysseus was justified in killing all the slaves.

223
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:29,784
Rym: right.

224
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:35,350
Scott: so Having not read completely other translations, I've read you know small portions.

225
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,542
Rym: Yeah, that's why I'm really curious.

226
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,982
Rym: from your impression What kind of person do you think Odysseus is?

227
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:41,369
Rym: is what I really want to ask you.

228
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:42,893
Scott: well That's the thing right is like.

229
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:51,054
Scott: so on the one hand you sort of feel like well this story is so old and not Advanced right.

230
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,040
Scott: it doesn't have modern sensibilities.

231
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:59,180
Scott: It has the most ancient of sensibility possible yep Almost the most ancient human sensibility possible.

232
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,819
Scott: so you assume that it's sort of really Straightforward and not complex.

233
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,216
Scott: right Odysseus is a is a straightforward Hero good guy, dude.

234
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:13,190
Scott: right he goes to a war, but it can't get home because the gods are tormenting him.

235
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,715
Scott: But he's a smart good awesome, dude Which is why Athena likes him.

236
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:17,096
Scott: I love.

237
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:23,748
Rym: he's so smart and good that the the opening to the book is basically just Athena being Like hey Zeus remember Odysseus.

238
00:16:24,353 --> 00:16:25,480
Rym: We should do something about him.

239
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,115
Rym: and Zeus is even like oh, yeah He's like the one smart one.

240
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:31,489
Scott: all right all right his special skills are lying and fighting.

241
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:37,070
Rym: That's pretty much all he lying fighting and then crying about the aftermath of fighting.

242
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,440
Scott: There's three things you know, but he's a good person.

243
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,570
Scott: He cares about his family right now.

244
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,685
Scott: You know he cares about his crew people right even though.

245
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:52,655
Scott: He's banging a hot goddess He still wants his regular life and frankly his crew people not the sharpest tools in the shed You know.

246
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:56,777
Scott: and then you know he gets home And you know he takes care of things.

247
00:16:56,837 --> 00:17:06,650
Scott: and if in a way that you know it's a modern sensibility seems evil and cruel First he lies and then he fights yeah exactly those are his two things.

248
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:08,910
Scott: Say I guess he's okay at voting.

249
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:10,778
Rym: I guess what I enjoyed the most.

250
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:15,498
Rym: that didn't come out because when I read the old when I read this originally I read the Odyssey in high school fall friend.

251
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:16,924
Rym: and was that it?

252
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:20,204
Rym: I Didn't really get him be like.

253
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:21,569
Rym: it said like oh, yeah He's a good liar.

254
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,373
Rym: But I didn't really like.

255
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:23,016
Rym: think about like.

256
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:32,214
Rym: I had to have that analysis sort of spoon-fed to me And it didn't really come out from the text that he was a good liar other than the text telling me over and over again He's good at lying.

257
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,902
Rym: reading this he is good at lying.

258
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:40,621
Scott: He lies all the time comes up with Incredibly complex people are like oh, who are you?

259
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,470
Scott: and he comes up with this complete character?

260
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,770
Scott: I'm from this town in this place, and I met this person our vandal a right.

261
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,970
Scott: He's got like a whole story just out of his ass with every minute detail.

262
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,327
Scott: Person's life, that's mostly believable, so I know it was his own dad.

263
00:17:58,347 --> 00:17:59,572
Rym: I noticed something I did.

264
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,589
Rym: the only one the only person he does not fool is this dog.

265
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:06,204
Rym: Mm-hmm I love how his dog is like doesn't the dog just die about?

266
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:08,553
Rym: the dog sees him and it's like well You're back.

267
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:09,757
Rym: I see you now.

268
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:10,881
Rym: I'm dead.

269
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:12,768
Rym: I was only waiting to see you.

270
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:16,301
Scott: yep So I think the thing about his lying though right is that?

271
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:18,590
Scott: is that the structure of the book?

272
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,890
Scott: Actually sort of like the chronology of it was totally messed up.

273
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,088
Scott: This is the thing that I noticed the most right and most people don't seem to notice this.

274
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:31,145
Scott: oh Yeah, so normally you think of the story of the Odyssey right and it's like well.

275
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,790
Scott: What order do the things happen?

276
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,493
Scott: This is the order.

277
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:34,396
Scott: the things happen.

278
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:34,998
Scott: right.

279
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:35,921
Scott: he's at the war.

280
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:38,029
Scott: he runs away from the war.

281
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,797
Rym: Well, he would they win the war and he leaves right.

282
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:41,840
Scott: he leaves the war.

283
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:46,777
Scott: then all those adventure things happen with the Cyclops And the men and yeah right.

284
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:59,049
Scott: then he gets trapped on the island with the goddess yeah, then he escapes that island to get to the island with Nausicaa and Then from the island with Nausicaa they actually help him get home.

285
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:05,706
Rym: Then when he's home he deals with all this shit And then he just that's the actual chronological order and all the shit that home like telemic is not.

286
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:06,610
Rym: that is happening in parallel.

287
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,190
Scott: But what order if you actually read this book are these things told to you in the book?

288
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:28,217
Scott: He starts on the island with the goddess yeah, and then he goes to the island with Nausicaa and then he tells them the story of the things that happened between the war and Being on the island with the goddess.

289
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:31,570
Scott: they don't actually say show you those things happening.

290
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:38,407
Scott: Yeah, that's Odysseus telling that King Nausicaa's dad about those things happening and the thing that's.

291
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:42,380
Scott: and when he's telling him Those things is he lying.

292
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,749
Rym: I am so sure he's lying.

293
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:47,535
Scott: so Once I realize this.

294
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:55,577
Scott: but all those things about the sirens all the famous parts the sirens the world cool That that that's only Odysseus telling a king.

295
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:57,482
Scott: those things happened right?

296
00:19:58,003 --> 00:19:59,006
Scott: are they actually true?

297
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:01,472
Scott: is the stuff that happened at the war Even true?

298
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:06,670
Scott: well first of all the same time that happened at the war is corroborated by other people like Menelaus.

299
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:14,150
Rym: Yeah, okay, telemic is we see him actually going around and talking to people right and they like they all agree on the history.

300
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:23,462
Scott: Yeah, the second thing is that even though once I realized that and I was like oh Maybe all the fantasy famous adventure shit.

301
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:27,877
Scott: That's in one chapter of this book by the way yeah, all that's in one chapter where he lie tells the king.

302
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:41,745
Scott: that is that part a lie because everything every story Odysseus tells everyone Else is a lie, but some things he knows later on like in the even towards the end of the book There's a part where Odysseus is thinking to himself, and he's like.

303
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:45,140
Scott: he's like oh, man This isn't as bad as he's like.

304
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,170
Scott: am I gonna fight all these suitors, and he's like well I killed that fucking Cyclops.

305
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,338
Scott: And it's like he wasn't lying about the Cyclops.

306
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:55,785
Scott: because why would he unless he lied to so much that he convinced himself It was about to make a point that that is?

307
00:20:55,825 --> 00:21:07,430
Rym: the only Potential disruption to your read of that is that people who are very good at lying and tell certain lies consistently Tend to accidentally start to believe those lies and internalize them.

308
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,476
Scott: There's also other truths for example.

309
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:18,470
Scott: so we everything that happened at the war was confirmed by other people who are also at the Trojan War And he did leave on a boat with a bunch of dudes and those dudes are gone.

310
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:19,861
Scott: What the hell happened to them?

311
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:20,890
Scott: if his story is a lie?

312
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:36,969
Scott: Right, so I'm pretty confident that the story We know what happened to them according to him They'll say I'm fairly confident that all the things that he said happened between the war and being on Calypso's Island were mostly true.

313
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:37,650
Rym: Yeah

314
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:53,094
Scott: But and then when he's because it's you know it's a it's primitive writing from the ancient times when he's telling stories to other people and the book the story makes it obvious to the reader that he's lying because he's usually starts those stories by saying he's someone other than Yeah,

315
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:55,104
Rym: but at the same time when he tells

316
00:21:55,144 --> 00:21:57,172
Scott: the king he's Odysseus He's not lying,

317
00:21:57,513 --> 00:22:00,521
Rym: but he also like reading those passages where he tells the story.

318
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:18,001
Rym: the thing I noticed being a pretty good liar myself Is that he (Laughter) He you in the telling of the story he does the things that Someone who's good at lying would do.

319
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:23,701
Rym: when they're lying like Lampshading the fact that he lies he half his stories are.

320
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:28,787
Rym: so I lied to this other motherfucker And I'm telling you about it.

321
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:30,434
Rym: That is like.

322
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:35,110
Rym: that is one of the best ways to convince someone you're lying to that you're not lying to them.

323
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:39,607
Rym: Bring them into the trust of yeah, so I lied to that other guy about this thing.

324
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:52,050
Rym: hmm And he also like he starts to include very specific details sometimes in the manner that someone who's lying might Do that about exactly how far away the rock was thrown.

325
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:59,157
Scott: But here's the thing is that other people when they're telling stories and not lying Also include all those details.

326
00:22:59,197 --> 00:23:05,260
Scott: remember this is yeah these ancient times are before books TV cell phones distractions Whatever all right.

327
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,256
Scott: so people mostly spent their time Entertainment with storytelling.

328
00:23:08,276 --> 00:23:11,910
Scott: so people were good at telling stories or remembered lots and lots of details.

329
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:24,510
Scott: But so I feel like if you showed up at say a king's house Asking for piston the night, and they asked you about your life They would expect you to have all those details because that's how everyone has can tell stories like that true

330
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:33,564
Rym: But at the same time it sort of implied that being a really excellent liar is a core fundamental Aspect of great Greek men.

331
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:44,054
Rym: well and one might notice that all the people telling these stories are great men and Are probably maybe they're all lying to each other great Great in quotes.

332
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:49,250
Rym: Yeah, I'm making quote marks and Telemachus is too young to know how to lie effectively.

333
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:54,969
Rym: So he's just earnest and I did Look at it that maybe other people are lying to him.

334
00:23:55,612 --> 00:24:03,116
Scott: So so so Telemachus right people tell me is basically glossed over and not paid attention to and people Adapt or homage to the Odyssey.

335
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,099
Scott: Yeah, right.

336
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,583
Scott: so the thing about Telemachus.

337
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:06,927
Scott: That's interesting is one.

338
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:12,787
Rym: He's 20 Yeah, but the book it treats him like he's seven mm-hmm.

339
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:20,670
Rym: the book is like He is to die like he is too young to know anything about anything like even walks outside like you.

340
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,052
Rym: They're worried.

341
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:21,755
Rym: He's gonna die.

342
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:21,916
Rym: well.

343
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:23,484
Scott: I mean you look at Odysseus.

344
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:24,790
Scott: He's got the time of the scar.

345
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,432
Scott: He's got the.

346
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:28,303
Scott: so people know it's him for sure yeah, but the story of how he got it.

347
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:31,969
Scott: It's like he was doing Adventury shit from a young age.

348
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:38,539
Scott: Telemachus I think was sheltered in this wealthy house and yep even though he's 20 He wasn't doing adventury shit like Odysseus was.

349
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,638
Rym: arguably his first adventure is because Odysseus isn't there And he goes out to try to deal with that.

350
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,590
Scott: yeah, and you know and the thing is he's not.

351
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:46,059
Scott: He's not like herp-de-derp.

352
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:46,703
Scott: It's like you know.

353
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:47,769
Scott: usually he learns.

354
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:47,956
Scott: Yeah.

355
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:56,710
Scott: Usually when you have that sort of character like the weak young Kid who never went on an adventure is like they suck, but Telemachus actually doesn't suck.

356
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,548
Scott: He's just inexperienced, and he you know shows that he clearly he's the son of Odysseus.

357
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:05,097
Scott: yep You're not actually gonna suck if you practice.

358
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:07,525
Rym: look at his baby's first deceit of like.

359
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:13,166
Rym: well don't tell my mom I'm leaving yeah, and I. but then you compare that to Odysseus and his like.

360
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:23,923
Scott: so here's what we're gonna Do to trick the Cyclops right and even though he doesn't like you know he can't physically do anything about the suitors Right he totally just smack talks them all the time.

361
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:27,739
Scott: Yeah, he has no problem smack You know talking back to them, but he just can't.

362
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,770
Rym: actually that's something that didn't come out either when I read the Odyssey originally.

363
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,699
Scott: He isn't just like oh poor suitors.

364
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:32,760
Scott: No.

365
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:33,785
Scott: I'll do what you want.

366
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:34,850
Scott: He's like you fucking assholes.

367
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,326
Scott: Why don't you get the hell out of here, but I really like you can't make us.

368
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:38,989
Scott: He's like you're right I can't but you guys suck.

369
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:46,083
Rym: I really read Telemachus as this kind of wishy-washy Like milk toast piece of crap kinda like that.

370
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:51,021
Rym: he wasn't aggressive that he was weak But reading this translation really brought out out.

371
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:53,610
Rym: He's doing what he can yeah, and I think it's partly just that.

372
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,432
Rym: the Capabilities.

373
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:59,289
Scott: yeah, if he was a badass you probably would have just murdered them all in day one, but he wasn't so.

374
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,357
Rym: But he's got this kernel of it like.

375
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:04,649
Rym: he's got the kernel of violence and the kernel of lying like ready mm-hmm.

376
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:07,084
Rym: So let's see.

377
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:27,629
Rym: But I just the way Odysseus tells that story because though another way to look at this like you said is he lands on this island after the war Alone tells this elaborate story, and then the kings of the all the people on this island give him Enough treasure to basically account for everything you would have had if he'd gone to the war

378
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:28,032
Scott: Mm-hmm,

379
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:29,502
Rym: and then he just goes home with all

380
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:30,167
Scott: that mm-hmm.

381
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,270
Rym: I do like this kind of sad as an aside though that that island gets completely fucked over for helping him.

382
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:42,830
Rym: Yep, like that is not really talked about much like yeah, Zeus or Poseidon just punished them forever, and they're gone.

383
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:48,206
Scott: Well, I mean I think you know Odysseus doesn't really care about anyone other than himself.

384
00:26:48,227 --> 00:27:00,642
Scott: He doesn't care about like side Consequences, you know it's like the whole Trojan War is like a huge Like basically natural disaster, and he doesn't give it.

385
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:01,366
Scott: He doesn't get a crap.

386
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:04,830
Rym: Yeah, of course It's hard to say cuz I don't care about his man who died.

387
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:09,050
Scott: You know even though he makes at the very end he makes peace all of those families, but he doesn't care.

388
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:23,288
Rym: Well notice so he when they're leaving Cersei's house There's what's-his-name props to my man F. Whatever his name was I can't remember who got drunk and just fucking fell to his death from the ceiling because he was dumb and drunk And Odysseus was like.

389
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:23,873
Rym: well we got to go.

390
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,141
Rym: so they just didn't like.

391
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:37,890
Rym: they just left him laying there and The only reason he goes back and buries the guy and does all that stuff is because he meets the guys Literal ghost and makes a promise to that ghost and then he has to follow through on the promise or I'll get in trouble.

392
00:27:38,151 --> 00:27:51,579
Scott: Yep, I feel like if he does what you know and the other thing is that people you know Oh, this is so smart and so powerful and so awesome 90% of the time Athena just says Odysseus do this and he does that and then Athena makes him strong.

393
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:52,988
Scott: Athena puts a disguise on him.

394
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:56,669
Scott: Athena You know tells him what exactly where to go and what to say and what to do.

395
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,312
Rym: It's a little.

396
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:58,857
Scott: are you really that awesome?

397
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:03,553
Scott: if Athena is just there some goddess is just you know helping you out and giving you Specific.

398
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:06,490
Rym: and now because if you look at the story Athena didn't help him with Polyphemus.

399
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,650
Scott: No, they're you know, there are definitely things Athena didn't help.

400
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,417
Rym: Athena didn't help it with Cersei.

401
00:28:11,477 --> 00:28:14,890
Rym: He dealt with Cersei on his own mostly Hermes gave him some advice there.

402
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:16,159
Scott: Yeah, but it's it's still.

403
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:19,760
Scott: it's like there's a lot of God Interference going on right?

404
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,030
Rym: It's like there is a lot of non God interference.

405
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:22,674
Rym: But I do like.

406
00:28:23,157 --> 00:28:25,430
Rym: I read Athena very differently too in this translation.

407
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:29,951
Rym: She's very like oh my god is bell dandy magical girl like.

408
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:31,779
Rym: there's a lot more stuff going on with her.

409
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:41,328
Rym: that comes out in this text because she's actually Kind of chill and a little bit snarky and a little bit like I'm gonna help you out like do this.

410
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:41,769
Rym: Let's go.

411
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,349
Rym: and She's also really good at lying.

412
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:47,922
Scott: Well, she's also like sort of eager to do certain things.

413
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,130
Scott: Yeah, and Zeus is sort of like whatever right?

414
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,076
Scott: So she's a lot of times.

415
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,990
Rym: She's like, I really want to help this Odysseus guy.

416
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,496
Scott: She's like she's like Zeus.

417
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:55,702
Scott: I want to do this.

418
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:56,867
Scott: It'd be so fucking awesome.

419
00:28:56,907 --> 00:29:00,705
Scott: It's just like Alright, and then she's like, yes, she goes down.

420
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:01,490
Scott: She's like, yeah, let's fuck.

421
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,350
Scott: Yeah, and she's on Odysseus aside.

422
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,253
Scott: So other people get fucked.

423
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:12,245
Rym: as opposed to Poseidon you get the impression that he's just looking around like someone in Philadelphia Just waiting for anyone to cross him, right?

424
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:12,990
Rym: He just comes down.

425
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,542
Scott: He's like who's burning lots of things and sacrifice to me.

426
00:29:16,602 --> 00:29:18,228
Scott: those people good those people good.

427
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:20,698
Scott: Mmm I don't see a lot of smoke coming from over there.

428
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,346
Scott: Yeah, who's that smoke for?

429
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:22,909
Scott: not for me?

430
00:29:23,871 --> 00:29:25,849
Scott: Mmm, there's any water near these people.

431
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:28,320
Scott: Let me see.

432
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,476
Rym: they got any boats And it also reminds you that boat.

433
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:34,238
Scott: move of it back.

434
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:37,288
Rym: how powerful Poseidon is that even Zeus is like?

435
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:43,010
Rym: yeah Odysseus really got the short end of the stick, but I can't really do anything about what Poseidon wants.

436
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:46,968
Rym: Even Zeus can't really tell Poseidon what to do.

437
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:50,661
Scott: So I like how Zeus is like.

438
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:52,730
Scott: he's the god of strangers, right?

439
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,593
Scott: Yeah, it's I about that.

440
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:56,366
Scott: and like most of the book like this is one more.

441
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:07,870
Scott: I mean there's a lot of morals but the number one moral of the book seems to be if someone comes to visit you properly, yep, you gotta be just nice to them and Don't treat them like shit.

442
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:23,059
Scott: and if you visit someone you can totally expect them to feed you and give you treasure and It's sort of like hey everyone if people are traveling around even if you don't know who the hell they are you should be nice to them and Treat them nicely and that's a lesson.

443
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,230
Scott: I think that is good for the modern world.

444
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:36,770
Rym: But also based on the context of the forward and a bunch of reading I did about the old Greece is That there seemed to be this idea that people who shared food and did this stranger thing.

445
00:30:37,191 --> 00:30:53,913
Rym: they would then basically be allies and not make war against each other or cause trouble for each other and That was a way to sort of prevent in like local warfare So that to the rest of the world the Greeks are these roving like murderous barbarians that just come to your shores and fucking kill Everything and eat everything.

446
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,842
Scott: I mean in I guess in newer times than this.

447
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:59,749
Scott: right you know lots of nomadic peoples have the same kind of thing.

448
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,656
Scott: Hospitality right where it's like.

449
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,343
Scott: you know you come into my tent.

450
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:04,428
Scott: You know kind of thing.

451
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:05,835
Rym: yeah well We've shared water now.

452
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:06,860
Rym: We can't ever go to war.

453
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,750
Rym: yep, but we did neither one.

454
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:09,633
Rym: We know there's.

455
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:12,744
Rym: let us be friends, but we know there's people on that other island.

456
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,410
Rym: Did you ever have water with them?

457
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:17,029
Rym: No, let's just go steal all their shit.

458
00:31:17,194 --> 00:31:18,929
Scott: It's like yeah They were jerks and he visited them.

459
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,794
Scott: And it's sort of like.

460
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:27,450
Scott: well nice people who treat foreigners nicely are treated nicely But even the people who treat each other nicely if you're a shithead won't treat you nicely.

461
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,188
Scott: It's sort of like it's okay to kill jerks.

462
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:36,150
Rym: Yep, because I noticed when they put when he's telling the story of all the different places They land like all these short vignettes.

463
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:45,630
Rym: They land on the one island and everybody tries to eat them and they land on Polyphemus Island and he just eats them and then he goes by skillet and crib doesn't skill.

464
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,777
Rym: I just eat six of them.

465
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:48,649
Rym: a lot of people get eaten.

466
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:50,597
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's a good.

467
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,310
Scott: it is also a good lesson for the modern world, right?

468
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,014
Rym: Don't get eaten.

469
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:56,050
Scott: be nice to everyone except jerks.

470
00:31:57,231 --> 00:31:59,069
Scott: Jerks, you can treat like shit cuz they're jerks.

471
00:31:59,471 --> 00:31:59,954
Rym: I do enjoy.

472
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:03,610
Rym: you know you talked about like you don't have to tolerate intolerance how the gods do a lot.

473
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:14,370
Rym: but if you notice as most situations where a god or goddess helps Odysseus They're only helping them with the part with him with the part that he can't do anything about.

474
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:19,873
Rym: Because there's one point where Hermes is like and I think Athena says a similar thing to him at one point You can't.

475
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:22,262
Rym: Cersei definitely says this you're a human.

476
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:24,310
Rym: You can't do shit about what the gods want.

477
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:27,566
Rym: If a god tells you to do something you do it.

478
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:28,169
Rym: That's right.

479
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,926
Rym: Ghostbusters taught us that lesson, but not but.

480
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:42,118
Scott: but Someone asked you if you're a god you say this is in the lucky position where the gods want good happen to want him to do Any unlucky position whether them do.

481
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:45,230
Rym: he's in the unlucky position where the gods are interested in him.

482
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:52,229
Rym: It's this double-edged sword if the gods notice you it's generally more bad than good even if they want to help you.

483
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:59,430
Rym: But because the gods noticed him and are fucking with him at least he has other gods who like him enough to help him.

484
00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:03,006
Scott: If you want to know about God's noticing you you should watch Clash of the Titans.

485
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:10,903
Rym: Yeah Or possibly read the Prince of Nothing series depending on how that goes Because that is definitely do not let the gods notice you.

486
00:33:11,164 --> 00:33:11,888
Scott: what do you see?

487
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,548
Scott: The Lord of the Rings you don't want the Eye of Sauron upon you do not want it to see you.

488
00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:24,018
Rym: But oh I had.

489
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:27,265
Rym: it was nothing I was thinking of along the lines of polyphemus and all these people eating people right.

490
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:32,070
Rym: so the gods Like they make all these points about how you can't do anything about the gods.

491
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:39,619
Rym: You can only do things about people and the gods really only help Odysseus with the god stuff And he really just deals with the people stuff on his own.

492
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:53,822
Rym: He's pretty good at it, but at the same time With the people stuff he very often makes mistakes like he doesn't tell his crew the full truth And then as a result they do something stupid, and then he gets fucked over by it.

493
00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:56,370
Scott: that happens with the cow eating situation.

494
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,332
Rym: Yeah, he's just like yeah, don't do this thing but he doesn't really tell him why.

495
00:34:01,352 --> 00:34:10,420
Rym: or like don't open this bag, but doesn't really tell him why and then they do something stupid and That ruins him, but should he?

496
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,770
Rym: I feel like he could have lied to his guys Or he could have told him the truth.

497
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,000
Rym: They both would have worked, but instead he just omits the truth.

498
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:24,149
Rym: it seems like omitting is worse than both lying and not lying And that seems to come up multiple times.

499
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:30,364
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, you know it's like Yeah, he was sort of following the instructions.

500
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:31,210
Scott: He was given right.

501
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,958
Scott: He was like don't eat the right But he can't make anyone else follow the instructions right.

502
00:34:34,978 --> 00:34:39,828
Scott: if I if I see a lot of times where he sees Athena and no One else sees her right stuff like that.

503
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:44,766
Scott: And it's like how if I saw God and it told me stuff and then what am I gonna tell you?

504
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:45,268
Scott: hey Rym?

505
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:51,016
Scott: I saw Athena, and she said do this you put me in the crazy house The same time at one point.

506
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:56,118
Rym: tell tell tell Emma kiss is like Athena told me to do this and everyone's like oh Then you should do it mm-hmm.

507
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,249
Rym: if Athena tells you to do something just do it like.

508
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:01,038
Rym: Everyone agrees that gods are literally real.

509
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:04,690
Scott: and even that time where it's like Oh Zeus send me a sighs like Thunder.

510
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:13,030
Rym: It's like oh all right Immediate thunder, but there's one thing in Emily Wilson's translation that I noticed specifically.

511
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:16,305
Rym: I remember when they win the siren bit which is so short.

512
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:17,490
Rym: It's like such in passing.

513
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:21,473
Scott: It is weird that that's like the number one most Adapted.

514
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:25,386
Scott: you know thing in other media other you know tales yet.

515
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:26,389
Scott: It's like a page.

516
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:29,744
Scott: It's less than a page, but how?

517
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:35,790
Scott: I wonder how you know that became like that portion of the story became the.

518
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:41,396
Scott: You know as it were the story was adapted over the years how that part was magnified and the other modified.

519
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:45,205
Rym: Sexy bird ladies because it's fun.

520
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:55,810
Rym: Yeah There I think actually the forward talks a little bit about that Especially because it points out that the thing the siren seduce Odysseus with is not any of the things.

521
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,323
Scott: Oh, I love that a lot.

522
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:00,456
Rym: that yeah They literally try to seduce him with.

523
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:05,750
Rym: we'll tell you about what happened in the war that you fought because you clearly have PTSD.

524
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,277
Scott: Yep, imagine Rym if there was like.

525
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:11,346
Scott: you know you're going past some sirens right and it's like you know.

526
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:15,030
Scott: people tend to think you know With the sirens they were just singing such sweet music.

527
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,829
Scott: It was so wonderful to hear you wanted to go over and listen to it forever because it was like.

528
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:19,752
Scott: you know I'm mystifying.

529
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:20,033
Scott: It's like.

530
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:22,359
Scott: no the sirens were like hey Odysseus.

531
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,582
Scott: We know everything.

532
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:27,152
Scott: he's like uh-huh all right, so he's like Rym.

533
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,335
Scott: I know everything uh-huh.

534
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:30,161
Scott: I'll tell you what dark matter is.

535
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:31,144
Rym: oh, no.

536
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:32,187
Rym: I'd swim over there.

537
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:37,801
Scott: It's like I'll let you play this video game.

538
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,770
Scott: I'll let you play quest for glory.

539
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:47,271
Rym: But when Cersei warns him about the sirens she basically says I'll tell you what happens in half-life 3.

540
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:54,898
Rym: She says like like plug your ears if you want to hear it like if you're curious Get your men to tell you up like if.

541
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,021
Rym: but when Odysseus tells his men about the sirens He says she told me I have to listen.

542
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:10,378
Rym: I Thought that was really really funny That that divide between those two lines I mean that stood out in my head.

543
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:11,081
Rym: cuz I got to.

544
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:11,844
Scott: you're a smart.

545
00:37:11,884 --> 00:37:14,995
Scott: cuz if you're a smart person at least You're a curious person, right?

546
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:15,998
Scott: Yeah, Odysseus.

547
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:20,270
Scott: We're told is the smart person smarter than the other people and there's some evidence of that?

548
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:22,070
Scott: Yeah, so you know he's curious as hell.

549
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:28,630
Rym: And also it's smart because if he was like yeah guys I really want to listen to this shit cuz apparently it's awesome.

550
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:31,297
Rym: But none of you can You know what happened?

551
00:37:31,538 --> 00:37:33,510
Rym: one of his 88 people would have pulled the earplugs out.

552
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:38,895
Scott: You can't tie everyone to the back to the mask because Who's gonna row the boat?

553
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:42,530
Rym: and he learned his lesson because all the other times his crew fucked up.

554
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,989
Rym: Yeah, so it was both smart that he did that and really funny that that's how he did it.

555
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:54,436
Rym: That stood out to me really strongly even though I read that part a long time ago cuz we announced this book club in like March.

556
00:37:54,946 --> 00:38:02,397
Rym: okay so I mean uh Really really like this translation And I really like the story.

557
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:04,585
Scott: the main thing that you know that I like about it.

558
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:16,290
Scott: Is that it's just way Easy to read because usually when you have translations of things They're they're all written in a way that makes them difficult to read or you have to read them slowly and carefully.

559
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:24,170
Rym: I'm just easy to read but more like I Intrinsically got the parts that were funny or the parts that were supposed to be scared.

560
00:38:24,732 --> 00:38:30,930
Scott: I can both breeze through it and not have to read slowly and carefully and also gain a complete understanding of what's happening.

561
00:38:31,994 --> 00:38:35,810
Scott: A lot of the ones are written in sort of fake oldie English.

562
00:38:36,372 --> 00:38:41,848
Scott: You know they're written the way that Shakespeare actually wrote, but fakely right now put in like so these mr..

563
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:42,330
Rym: Thou mr.

564
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:50,090
Scott: Thou yeah thousand these and whatever to sound old even though the the Shakespeare was thousands of years after.

565
00:38:51,573 --> 00:39:04,331
Scott: But the difference between current English You know the English that we speak on this podcast and the English of Shakespeare is a spec compared to the difference between Shakespeare's English and Greek Homer.

566
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:13,029
Scott: so what's the point if you're even if you use fancy old words that they're not any old They're not really as old as Greek, so what's the point right?

567
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,250
Rym: What is the difference between as long as I'll make it so someone can fucking read it like reading a paragraph or a stanza?

568
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,715
Rym: Whatever, and then there's the note.

569
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:22,686
Rym: That's like Telemachus is being snarky here versus just reading.

570
00:39:22,706 --> 00:39:25,629
Rym: be like a Telemachus Yeah, yeah.

571
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:33,092
Rym: And like the ghosts were not scary at all in high school like when I read that bit with like ghosts It was just like.

572
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:36,825
Rym: so what these people just like walk over and talk to him this part.

573
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:38,410
Rym: It actually was like creepy.

574
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:44,617
Scott: Yes, like yeah in order to in order to proceed he had to go into hell and back Yeah, and it's like oh shit.

575
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:45,340
Scott: Where's he going?

576
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:51,864
Rym: I like that bit a lot cuz he's like Scared, but then he starts to do it, and then he's like really individually see like his graph.

577
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:52,928
Scott: forget all the details.

578
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:57,457
Rym: like he sees He sees captain what's-his-name?

579
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:58,501
Rym: who fell to his death.

580
00:39:58,722 --> 00:40:03,863
Scott: yeah, right like that guy's just like oh, yeah He sees Agamemnon, but Agamemnon runs there later to see the suitors.

581
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:07,134
Scott: Oh, yeah, that was funny Agamemnon.

582
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:13,489
Scott: at the almost at the very end of the book all the suitors are dead and Agamemnon and Achilles are there and isn't someone else there?

583
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:14,548
Rym: I forget so yet.

584
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:21,194
Scott: But basically those are the two important ones that are there, and they're like oh all the awesome dudes from Ithaca Why the hell are you dead?

585
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:26,030
Scott: and they're like we were trying to get with Odysseus' wife because he disappeared.

586
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:28,728
Scott: Yeah, and they're like they knew Odysseus in life, right?

587
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:32,278
Rym: Yeah And like half the ghosts are like motherfucking Odysseus.

588
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:33,381
Scott: Oh my god.

589
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:39,823
Scott: Yeah, and then they're like you know because they didn't think the suitors are bad Because they weren't paying attention to what was happening in the real world.

590
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:41,029
Scott: right and then they're like.

591
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,940
Scott: But then Odysseus actually came back and his wife didn't.

592
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:48,330
Scott: you know like was actually loyal to him and wouldn't get with any of us.

593
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:52,769
Scott: And Agamemnon's like man, what an awesome wife not like my bitch wife who killed me.

594
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,378
Rym: Yep, Agamemnon is really like.

595
00:40:55,438 --> 00:41:03,275
Rym: his advice to Odysseus is pretty shitty and sexist because he's like yeah Don't let your like don't tell your wife too much Because she might do something to you.

596
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:05,743
Rym: You know and then but then at the same time.

597
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,070
Rym: He's like the Penelope is pretty smart.

598
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:22,417
Rym: Yeah My favorite bit of the ghost and we talked about this before the show was that Hercules comes out and he's just like all the other ghosts are like sad and mournful and wistful and Like they're they're very weird.

599
00:41:22,738 --> 00:41:35,186
Rym: and then and like yeah, we're dead and where there's no substance to us anymore And it sucks down here and then Hercules just comes out with a bow and arrow like Like you see Odysseus and all the other ghosts are afraid of his sword, and he's just like.

600
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:41,650
Rym: I'll fight you Like he comes right out just being badass like yeah, all these other people are dead, but I'm a badass I'm Heracles.

601
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,278
Rym: What do you want?

602
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,187
Rym: Let's go What up?

603
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,913
Scott: Yeah, you know.

604
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:57,683
Scott: it's also cool that even in whatever BC thousand-something BC sex and violence are still really awesome And people today still really like sex and violence.

605
00:41:57,703 --> 00:41:58,990
Scott: so not much has changed humans.

606
00:41:59,317 --> 00:41:59,502
Scott: Yeah.

607
00:42:00,114 --> 00:42:11,501
Rym: But the story does like Many parts of it feel very natural to a modern sensibility if you just translate it with natural modern language Like the like the lying and all the things Odysseus does like.

608
00:42:11,521 --> 00:42:14,714
Rym: a lot of it fits very well with the way we talk act And think today.

609
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:17,489
Rym: humans back then weren't that different from humans today?

610
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:21,262
Scott: I mean you can see most basic adventure stories you read today really aren't?

611
00:42:21,443 --> 00:42:23,450
Scott: you know have a lot in common with this, right?

612
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,323
Scott: You know it's like oh, I'm in a tight spot.

613
00:42:26,404 --> 00:42:29,502
Scott: I go on a little journey I get into another tight spot a little journey.

614
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:31,928
Scott: I have a goal in mind of place I want to get to at the end.

615
00:42:32,371 --> 00:42:33,616
Scott: You know the big bad guys.

616
00:42:33,656 --> 00:42:36,867
Scott: they get there they get their comeuppance everyone's happy.

617
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:38,936
Rym: the end yep And this is in the forward.

618
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,229
Rym: so I don't really want to go deep into it because you can read the forward if you didn't.

619
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:50,733
Rym: But I really like how specifically this calls out the slaves everywhere Because that's just that.

620
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:59,770
Rym: pre like proto-greek society like the Mycenae, you know all the civilizations that disappeared around the see people time Probably built the most entirely on slavery.

621
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,717
Scott: Yeah I mean you know most people they think.

622
00:43:01,777 --> 00:43:01,958
Scott: if you.

623
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:10,450
Scott: if I say to you ancient Greece most people in their mind immediately Have a picture of like you know Athens with white pillars and buildings everywhere.

624
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:13,668
Rym: Those pillars were painted the most gaudy paint you can imagine.

625
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:19,008
Scott: also You know parthenon's right and then lots of dudes and togas walking around right?

626
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:19,450
Scott: It's like.

627
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,710
Scott: That's what you think immediately.

628
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:21,513
Scott: But it's like.

629
00:43:21,874 --> 00:43:33,430
Rym: no it was way ancient human times before even feudalism Sparta invaded its neighbors and enslaved them to similarly to how the United States enslaved Africans.

630
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:40,010
Rym: Yeah, you had a rich dude And then you had a chattel slavery not not all those other forms of slavery from like later greek or roman times.

631
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:46,270
Scott: You had rich people who mattered in society at least and then a whole bunch of slaves and servants and other subs.

632
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:52,587
Rym: You know servile peoples below them and even like Circe has nymphs as slaves like.

633
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:54,551
Rym: they're just slaves Everywhere.

634
00:43:55,014 --> 00:43:58,714
Rym: and you see all these times so dizzy has had so few people with him that even on the trip he's always like.

635
00:43:59,157 --> 00:44:08,646
Rym: so I'll send you three and Take a slave like he'd send slaves along because he didn't have that many people to do stuff for him Mm-hmm, but they're never mentioned in it.

636
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:13,140
Rym: like the people Until he assigns a slave to like one of his scouting parties.

637
00:44:14,043 --> 00:44:21,467
Rym: at no point is anyone with him described Like until it matters and like oh yeah and some slaves like you wouldn't even know he had slaves with him.

638
00:44:21,568 --> 00:44:24,946
Scott: at the end though They do make they they make like this special note, right?

639
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:25,610
Scott: It's like okay.

640
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:32,473
Scott: Well, there's the swine herd who's like the best slave and he's a good person who lets people in his home and treats them Well still a slave.

641
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:36,004
Scott: He's still a slave but because he's good Odysseus treats him good.

642
00:44:36,044 --> 00:44:37,910
Scott: There's the cow herd also who's good.

643
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:45,430
Scott: Yeah, I mean I stayed loyal to Odysseus So he was treated well, and then there's the goat herd who is probably the worst motherfucker.

644
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:49,549
Scott: The goat herd is worse than the fucking suitors.

645
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:54,610
Scott: He's just an evil asshole who betrayed Odysseus and tried to help the suitors even though he was Odysseus's slave.

646
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,641
Scott: And it's like all the other like the suitors.

647
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,370
Scott: They just get speared in the head or whatever.

648
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,936
Scott: This is the goat herd man.

649
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:01,602
Scott: He gets like chopped up into pieces.

650
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:02,746
Scott: They like chop his nuts off.

651
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:06,836
Scott: I think it's like He gets it bad and they sort of.

652
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:08,145
Scott: you know, it's like he deserves it.

653
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:13,130
Scott: bad because You know, I guess he did a worse thing than what the suitors are doing.

654
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:18,641
Rym: Yep But those are the bits That are very different compared to a modern sensibility of a story.

655
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:29,239
Rym: all the stuff around the slaves all the stuff around the Retribution against like the women after and this after the suitors were killed all that stuff Definitely reeks of this very old and messed up age.

656
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,750
Scott: I like how he tells the grandmother the nanny slave grandma.

657
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:36,790
Scott: He's like, I don't need you to tell me, you know, which women are good and which ones aren't good.

658
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,875
Scott: I'll figure that out myself.

659
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:47,670
Scott: And then when it actually comes time, he's like, hey granny, which of the ladies should Which ones are gonna get hung outside and which ones are stayed loyal.

660
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:48,031
Scott: I guess

661
00:45:48,091 --> 00:46:07,031
Rym: it definitely comes out very clearly that Odysseus's primary attribute might not even necessarily be that he's good at lying Or good good at lying and fighting but it's that he spends almost all his effort Controlling what other people think about him and making sure that the story people tell about him is exactly the one he wants them to Tell.

662
00:46:07,635 --> 00:46:08,741
Rym: I mean he gets a bunch of his like.

663
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:15,330
Rym: he gets his men killed leaving Polyphemus's cave because as soon as he's out of range like as soon as he's on the boat, he turns around.

664
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,719
Rym: He's like yo, guess what?

665
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:17,927
Rym: My name's Odysseus.

666
00:46:18,169 --> 00:46:24,370
Rym: fucker Like he risks everyone's lives just to make sure someone will remember his story.

667
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,538
Scott: Also, even when he's lying and saying he's not Odysseus.

668
00:46:27,879 --> 00:46:30,045
Scott: He includes Odysseus in his story.

669
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:31,790
Scott: He's like, yeah, I met this.

670
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,705
Scott: He's like, yeah, my name is so-and-so I you know, and what?

671
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:35,650
Scott: what's my story?

672
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:43,390
Scott: I was traveling around that I met this totally awesome dude named Odysseus And he was doing this and then we parted ways and then I ended up here

673
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:44,573
Rym: You know, and

674
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:51,921
Scott: now that person who believes that lie may know of Odysseus because he's so famous but also now believes Awesomeness about Odysseus.

675
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:59,490
Rym: I would actually believe a Specific party lied a lot in is the part where he's recounting all the dead people he met.

676
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:03,370
Rym: Let's assume that he did go to Hades and some of that is true, which does make sense.

677
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:07,277
Scott: Yeah, I guess there's no that he could be lying about going to Hades But he's like he.

678
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,910
Rym: I think he learned of what happened to him Agamemnon there in a way that he might not have been able to other like.

679
00:47:13,493 --> 00:47:17,090
Rym: It's possible to argue that he learned things from them that he couldn't have learned otherwise.

680
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:29,862
Rym: But I would read that even if he literally did the Hades thing and literally met some of those people that he lied about most of them because it goes from like My mom like specific people who he learned something important.

681
00:47:30,203 --> 00:47:39,795
Rym: and then it's just like he name-drops fucking Everyone in all of Greek history, it's like oh, yeah and Hercules was there and Agamemnon was there.

682
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,260
Scott: the thing is it's like I'm the one.

683
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,097
Scott: usually what happens in a lot of stories a common trope is There'll be fantastical elements.

684
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:54,346
Scott: Yeah, right and those fantastical elements It's like oh that was actually that none of that literally happened.

685
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:55,250
Scott: that was just shown.

686
00:47:55,511 --> 00:48:00,010
Scott: You know, you thought it was literally happening, but actually it was in a dream or an imagination.

687
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:07,290
Rym: Example of that Kill Bill the Crazy 88 at the end of Kill Bill like there's this crazy fight scene.

688
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,980
Rym: It's like the climax of the movie the second movie.

689
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:14,074
Rym: when the crazy 88 comes up and someone tells the story They make it very clear.

690
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:16,082
Rym: Yeah, there weren't actually 88 of them.

691
00:48:16,584 --> 00:48:20,449
Scott: Well, there weren't 88 of them in the movie But you know there was a crazy fight.

692
00:48:20,671 --> 00:48:23,852
Rym: Yeah, the crazy 88 but that line if there weren't 88 of them in the way It's.

693
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:25,209
Scott: they just thought it was cool to call them.

694
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:32,070
Scott: But anyway, but now but the way that is more like, you know Utena where there's like there's an explanation for the supernatural parts that they do not real.

695
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:39,050
Scott: Yeah, even though you see you think the whole time you're reading the story is supernatural parts are real and then they're not actually real.

696
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:40,597
Scott: Right, they were just made.

697
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:46,560
Scott: you believe they were real but actually no in the Odyssey The supernatural parts are within the world of the Odyssey real.

698
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,265
Scott: bringing Zeus is making Thunder.

699
00:48:48,286 --> 00:48:49,329
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

700
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:56,890
Scott: so there's no reason to question the Hades part or The Cersei turning people into pigs part or the goddess and the island of

701
00:48:58,513 --> 00:48:59,499
Rym: Question that based

702
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:01,210
Scott: on this based on their supernatural

703
00:49:02,332 --> 00:49:13,683
Rym: oh, yeah, but based on the the Shorter they caught the giant name-dropping that happens after the important ones Really feels like you just throw it in right bunch of more stuff to keep the cuz.

704
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:14,045
Rym: he's got the.

705
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:25,135
Scott: he's basically got all The important people on this island listening to his story, but you what I'm saying is that you could easily Modify the Odyssey so slightly To where you could be like.

706
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:31,554
Scott: well all the soup most of the supernatural stuff happens on that the one chapter of adventure After the war right?

707
00:49:32,157 --> 00:49:35,250
Scott: Yeah, that's most of the supernatural stuff is there.

708
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:42,689
Scott: You could retell the Odyssey in such a way to where nothing supernatural at all happens outside of that one part.

709
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:46,801
Scott: and Yes, Odysseus actually is lying about all the supernatural thing.

710
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:51,177
Scott: else, you know, and that would be kind of a cool You know way to think about it.

711
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,383
Scott: That's not what happens in this.

712
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:53,669
Scott: Nope, you know the real one.

713
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:59,730
Rym: But I think you could even tell the story and I never considered this possibility until I read this translation.

714
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:04,270
Rym: You even tell the story of he might not have even made it to the fucking Trojan War.

715
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:15,104
Rym: He might have gone to this war bailed Had trouble ended up on this island and then just tells this giant story gets these people to give him much elude and then goes Home and fucks up the suitors.

716
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:19,265
Rym: Mm-hmm Like you could you could think that you could argue that the entire middle was a lie.

717
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:25,729
Rym: Mm-hmm But I really enjoyed it and I want to read pretty much anything that Emily Wilson translates at this point.

718
00:50:26,372 --> 00:50:27,759
Scott: What is she gonna translate that?

719
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:30,110
Scott: so there's the the Iliad which comes before the Odyssey?

720
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,678
Scott: Which is the actual story of the Trojan War.

721
00:50:32,718 --> 00:50:36,210
