1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,848
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 16th, 2018.

2
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:12,192
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:12,894
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:16,344
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight Aggretsuko.

5
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:17,434
Scott: A much better idea.

6
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:18,200
Rym: The anime.

7
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:20,238
Rym: Not the board game.

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,989
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:38,690
Rym: But like we were just saying in the forum, it seems like the way the ticket to riches on YouTube is to hoot and holler and be an angry jumping up and down monkey about something.

10
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:39,673
Scott: Go ahead.

11
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,380
Rym: Some sort of clickbait nonsense.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:41,982
Scott: Go ahead.

13
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:43,990
Rym: So is it time for the clickbait?

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:44,651
Rym: Maybe.

15
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,737
Rym: Actually, we got a bunch of news.

16
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:48,221
Scott: That time doesn't come.

17
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:49,865
Rym: We already got one person watching here.

18
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,430
Scott: That clock never rained.

19
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:53,470
Scott: Ever.

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,810
Rym: So, uh, yeah, we skipped the show on Monday, even though the Google Duplex is a fine topic.

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,792
Scott: It's a fine news.

22
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:02,854
Scott: It's not a total show.

23
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:03,676
Rym: I think it's a topic.

24
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:11,840
Rym: I think the use of technology for me to avoid ever having to talk to someone on the phone again is very important.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,965
Rym: And I look forward to this future.

26
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:13,870
Scott: I didn't say it's not important.

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,780
Scott: It's just not 30 minutes of a show.

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,653
Rym: I think there's 30 minutes of a show if we get into why people are so freaking afraid.

29
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,798
Scott: Anyway, today's Wednesday.

30
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:21,400
Scott: Leave your Monday.

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,048
Rym: You got any anime related or comic related news then?

32
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:27,740
Scott: There's tons of anime and comic related tiny news is out there.

33
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,710
Scott: So like there's gonna be a Galaxy Express live-action TV show.

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,131
Scott: Why?

35
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:35,140
Rym: Yeah, well, there's a bunch of live-action shows coming lately.

36
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:52,200
Scott: I noticed it seems like either there's more live-action shows lately based on anime/manga or we're just seeing just more reporting of it in the English anime news, meaning animanewsnetwork.com is reporting on it more.

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,820
Scott: Yeah, also, you know, like, like, you know, back in the day, we wouldn't hear about the stage play production of whatever.

38
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:06,879
Scott: But now I'm seeing, like, updates on, like, the cast of every single YoA Pedal live-action stage play.

39
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:07,380
Scott: that happens.

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,334
Scott: And it's like, why the fuck are there so many live-action YoA Pedal stage plays?

41
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:12,820
Scott: Who the hell in Japan is going to these?

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,824
Scott: Who's paying to make these?

43
00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:15,426
Scott: What the fuck?

44
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:26,160
Rym: What's fascinating to me, and this news is actually from summer of last year, but there was a news that was very recent where some interview happened, and that's how I learned that this exists.

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,205
Rym: I guess I just didn't notice.

46
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:41,917
Rym: They're making a Marmalade Boy live-action film, and what's fascinating to me about that is that Marmalade Boy was very well known among American anime weebs in a very long time ago.

47
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:44,101
Rym: In, like, the early 2000s.

48
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:49,260
Scott: Yeah, nobody who's an anime fan from, like, 2005 on even knows what the hell that is.

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,020
Rym: Like, it's weird to me how big it, like, just the assumption I had that literally anyone I talked to who watched anime.

50
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:03,487
Scott: I thought it was an obscure, forgotten show that only, like, certain way-deep people even knew existed or cared about.

51
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:05,240
Scott: I never even watched an episode of, I just know of it.

52
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:13,997
Rym: I watched a good bit of the show because the RIT Anime Club had not one, but two full VHS sets of this show because it was so fucking popular.

53
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:15,883
Scott: And I said, "Yeah, I don't feel like watching that thing,".

54
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:25,720
Scott: and then apparently, like, the memory of this still exists for someone, and someone's putting actual money to make a production of this in the year 2018?

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:37,072
Rym: I mean, in a midst, like, in an anime weeb fandom in the 2000s, like, everyone knew about this show even if they didn't watch it, but even then, it was a little weird to me.

56
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,059
Rym: Like, it just seemed, like, standard, like, "Oh, people know this show,".

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,420
Rym: but thinking about it now in light of modern anime, the plot of this show makes it extra hilarious.

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,880
Rym: Do you actually know the plot to Marmalade Boy?

59
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,480
Scott: I thought it was, like, a generic shoujo romance deal.

60
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:50,950
Rym: Yeah, but do you know the deal?

61
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,339
Rym: Like, what the shtick is?

62
00:03:52,922 --> 00:03:53,711
Scott: I didn't know it had a shtick.

63
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,460
Scott: I thought it was generic.

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,879
Rym: Alright, I'm gonna read, 'cause it's summarized here.

65
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,640
Rym: In the story, Mickey's parents announce that they are getting a divorce.

66
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:01,218
Scott: Okay.

67
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,880
Rym: And swapping partners with another couple who have a son of their own.

68
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:08,494
Rym: Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:14,660
Rym: So the mom, they basically, the parents of these two kids swap who is married to whom.

70
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,064
Scott: I've seen that.

71
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:20,660
Scott: That happened to a, there was a Major League Baseball, two players swapped wives.

72
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:20,863
Scott: Oh.

73
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:22,480
Scott: That's a real thing that happened.

74
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,379
Rym: And the plot is that the two kids fall in love.

75
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:26,259
Scott: Okay.

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Scott: And the meta-plot-- Isn't that the plot of Clueless, only without the parents swapping?

77
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,440
Rym: Yeah, but I see, only without the parents swapping.

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,619
Scott: I mean, it's just, I think the mom died and the dad married someone else, and then she was in love with a stepbrother, right?

79
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:43,820
Rym: Yeah, but just the parents swapping.

80
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,980
Rym: And also, the show had a lot of AMVs back in the day, like the anime.

81
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,379
Rym: Like, it was a show that just people made a million AMVs to.

82
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:58,479
Rym: And the AMVs always focused on the fact that basically the dude just sort of stalks this girl, and it's really creepy, and it's extra creepy.

83
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:59,298
Scott: Is that what happens?

84
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:00,797
Rym: Uh, sort of.

85
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:04,000
Scott: I mean, it's kind of easy to stalk someone when you live in the same house.

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,399
Rym: Yeah, even in the chat here, people are like, "I vaguely heard of Marmalade

87
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:07,540
Rym: Boy.".

88
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,538
Scott: How would you even know that it's stalking if they just, like, if Emily was stalking you, how would you know?

89
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,180
Scott: Like, how would it even... Your behavior would change, not at all.

90
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:30,160
Rym: In fact, I remember, I have, I still have it, when I won that contest at RIT Anime when I was a freshman, and the tape Nazi gave me that curated set of CDs in a box.

91
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:34,916
Rym: that was a box set of, quote, "important anime music

92
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:35,478
Rym: videos.".

93
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:40,100
Rym: Remember, it had, like, that color cover and, like, the insert and everything.

94
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:46,320
Rym: This creepy-ass music video to this show was on those CDs, and I have it to this day.

95
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:50,480
Rym: So, yeah, I don't know why they're making all these live-action things lately.

96
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,120
Rym: Is it just the, are they mining old properties that are cheap to get?

97
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:06,179
Scott: There must be people in Japan who are going to see them, and I'm guessing the production value of them is not very high, so I think they're being produced cheaply, quickly, and there must be just enough people there paying for it.

98
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,160
Rym: Whoa, so, apparently there was a sequel to Marmalade Boy that I didn't know about called...

99
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,320
Scott: Marmalade Boy 2.

100
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,390
Rym: A Marmalade Boy Little.

101
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,359
Scott: Parents swap back.

102
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:19,960
Rym: Marmalade Boy 2, it turns out you're actually brother and sister.

103
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,500
Scott: Marmalade Boy 2, they got married, and then they themselves swapped with two other people.

104
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,780
Rym: They swapped with the opposite parents from the other side of the other relationship.

105
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:37,320
Scott: When they swapped, it was gay, so she got with the wife from the other.

106
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,700
Rym: Oh, in a parallel universe.

107
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,341
Scott: Yeah.

108
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:44,700
Rym: Apparently, there was a 2001 live-action Taiwanese series.

109
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:57,140
Rym: Just, I never thought, after the year 2005, I never thought I would say the words Marmalade Boy again, except in making vague references to old anime no one remembers in panels.

110
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:04,860
Scott: For some reason, right, in, you know, in the United States, it seems like there's some properties, right, that sort of, they have life.

111
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,600
Scott: They're big enough to be repeated and repeated and repeated.

112
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:08,606
Scott: Yeah.

113
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:12,180
Scott: Voltron can get, you know, is like the sort of, I guess, the bottom level.

114
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:22,100
Scott: If you're Voltron and up, you can get repeated, remade, and whatever, but things below that basically have no chance to be remade, brought back to life in any way whatsoever.

115
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:30,260
Rym: I don't know, though, look, I mean, I've seen a lot of rumblings over the last four or five years about mask getting brought back in some fashion.

116
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:32,347
Rym: There was that comic.

117
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:46,039
Scott: Sure, but, you know, it seems like in Japan, and, you know, the anime manga properties, like, even these obscured small ones can somehow get revived, and, you know, things can happen to them.

118
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Rym: I mean, if I had to guess, there's two ways to go.

119
00:07:48,420 --> 00:08:05,416
Rym: On one hand, it might be older IP is cheap, and thus easy to just take a seat and use to adapt or do something with, or two, maybe something that was really big a long time ago, even if it's forgotten by the average fan, might have had enough of a critical mass of an audience back then.

120
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:06,180
Rym: who remember it.

121
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,800
Scott: Oh, well, that's the Utena level, right?

122
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:16,699
Scott: Where it's like, it was done, but because it was big enough, it can be, they can make a new manga volume or put out new merch on the anniversary or something like that, right?

123
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:23,780
Rym: I mean, if they announced that, like, B-Pop has reformed to make another Utena movie or something, I'd freak out and be all over that.

124
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,419
Scott: Right, but, I mean, you know, you look at some, what's this, like, a small insignificant anime?

125
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:29,658
Rym: Marmalade boy?

126
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,160
Scott: I mean, even smaller.

127
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,258
Scott: Fushigi Yugi?

128
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,019
Scott: Yeah, like, that's, how can they possibly bring that back?

129
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,659
Rym: Yeah, I feel like if Fushigi Yugi ever comes back, I'll eat my hat.

130
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,236
Rym: I'll buy a tiny chocolate hat and eat it.

131
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:50,260
Rym: So, in some other news that's comic related, not anime related, I only saw the headline, Scott seems to know about more about this, but-- I know vague details.

132
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,740
Rym: Stan Lee is apparently suing his own company for a billion dollars?

133
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,800
Scott: Right, so I don't know, the billion dollars is crazy, I think, File the lawsuit in excess of a billion dollars, that's on CNN.

134
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:19,820
Scott: Basically, Stan Lee, if you don't know, like, the Marvel Comics dude, right, you know, whatever you want to think about him, you know, he has their positive aspects to what he has done for comics in America and as a person and whatnot, you know, and basically, he does a lot of stories about him lately, right?

135
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,799
Scott: There's some, you know, because he's an old cranky man.

136
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:25,424
Rym: So,

137
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:43,904
Scott: you know, I've heard some, like, stories about Stan Lee that I've heard recently, it was like, A, I've heard stories about him being, like, a kept person, like, since he's an old man, like, I heard stories from, like, I guess, maybe his daughter or something that, like, people were, like, keeping him and controlling his, you know, monies and whatnot, you know-- Which is

138
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:44,840
Rym: not uncommon.

139
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,818
Scott: Right, because he's so old, he can't do anything about it, so he's sort of semi-prisoner.

140
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:58,839
Scott: I've heard stories about him, like, Me Too kind of stories because he's an old man, like, you know, being naughty to, like, the nurses who take care of him and stuff like that.

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,140
Scott: I've heard those kinds of stories.

142
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:09,100
Scott: I don't know how true any of this is, but the new story is there's a company called POW something, right, and this company is, like, legit.

143
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:23,340
Scott: So, basically, Stan Lee, obviously, you know, while Marvel will still use his name and pay respect to him as, you know, an important person in their history, and I think a lot of Marvel-- I don't know if Marvel Comics still say, like, Stan Lee presents at the beginning, or have his name on them anywhere.

144
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:24,757
Rym: I don't actually know, yeah.

145
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,780
Scott: They used to, but he's not actually, like, work for them anymore.

146
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,620
Scott: I think he has, like, some, you know, like, in-name position, like, emeritus something, something, but he doesn't have any actual, you know, official job there.

147
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:41,280
Rym: Oh, wow, yeah, here.

148
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:57,380
Rym: The complaint states that Duffy, the former business manager, whatever, took advantage of his grief over the death of his wife last year and his poor eyesight to basically get him to sign a power of attorney over to then take control of his assets.

149
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:17,080
Scott: Right, so he had this company, POW, and POW actually produced stuff, good or bad, that, you know, was sort of, I guess, the stuff that they made felt like stuff that was marketed a whole bunch, at least in the nerd community, because Stan Lee's name was attached to it, but no one actually seemed to care about, like, those-- I remember way back, like, I went to New York Comic-Con.

150
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:26,300
Scott: That's how long ago this was, and they had, like, this comic Ultimo or something that was sort of like Stan Lee's Astro Boy of some sort of, it was weird, and no one cared.

151
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:35,280
Scott: It didn't seem like anyone actually gave a shit about it, but it had some, like, this big marketing oomph behind it relative to what it was, and they produced a couple other things as well.

152
00:11:35,280 --> 00:12:10,720
Scott: There was, like, an anime they made that actually got made that also, you know, all the stuff that they made, there were, like, three or four properties, had Stan Lee's name attached, had more marketing dollars than it seemed like they warranted, and it seemed like no one cared about them, but I don't know how successful they actually were, and, like, this company actually did stuff, and it seems like now the company has, like, been sold to this Chinese company, which is totally a legit Chinese company that makes all kinds of stuff, but it seems like Stan Lee did not actually approve of that, and other weird things related to this have happened.

153
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:15,060
Scott: For example, recently, like, just now-ish, he tweeted on Twitter.

154
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:18,840
Scott: He's like, "This is the first tweet ever from actual Stan Lee on this account.

155
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,277
Scott: Someone else has been controlling this account the whole time.

156
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:23,700
Scott: Can you help me get my Facebook account back?

157
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:25,315
Scott: I don't have any control over

158
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:25,417
Scott: it.".

159
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:25,828
Scott: Yeah.

160
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,247
Scott: And it's like, "Huh.

161
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:27,911
Scott: All right.

162
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:29,138
Scott: That's

163
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:29,380
Scott: weird.".

164
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,480
Scott: So, yeah, lots of stuff going on in the Stan Lee department.

165
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:45,635
Scott: The main thing that surprises me is simply that Stan Lee is still alive and still not Alzheimer's, doesn't seem to be mentally unstable despite being, like, 90-something.

166
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,208
Scott: He's way old.

167
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,039
Scott: He is really old.

168
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:54,320
Rym: If I appear to be doing as okay as he's doing when I'm 90-something, yeah, I'll take it.

169
00:12:54,463 --> 00:12:54,898
Scott: I'll take it.

170
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:55,334
Scott: I'll take it.

171
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,039
Scott: I will take it.

172
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:58,139
Rym: If I can walk when I'm 90, I'll take it.

173
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:01,773
Rym: Hopefully, I'm going to be- If I can walk and I know my name, I'm all good.

174
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,260
Scott: My goal is just to be able to bike when I'm 90.

175
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,368
Scott: Yeah.

176
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,680
Rym: Might be easier to bike.

177
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,300
Rym: You might not be able to walk, but be able to bike.

178
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,019
Scott: Well, there's people who have, is it Parkinson's?

179
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:13,570
Scott: Or something?

180
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,580
Scott: One of those body disorders, right?

181
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:20,740
Scott: Where you can't control your body so well.

182
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,700
Scott: I saw a video where those people who had this- With the patterns?

183
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,439
Scott: I don't know which one it is, but they get on a bike and suddenly they're like, "Do, do, do, do,

184
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:29,499
Scott: do.".

185
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,200
Scott: They get off the bike and suddenly they're shaking.

186
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,940
Rym: There's a whole crazy field of study where regular patterns, I don't want to get into, it's not a Wednesday topic, but there's cool things.

187
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:48,420
Rym: People are just on glasses that do an AR overlay and show lines that move with you as you walk, and that allows people who have certain kinds of disorders like that to be able to function normally.

188
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,279
Rym: It's kind of cool and crazy.

189
00:13:49,582 --> 00:13:50,060
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

190
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,300
Rym: So in some other news, part of the reason why we bailed on the show on Monday was that Emily and I were out of town.

191
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,380
Rym: Emily every year, because she is a writer and comic artist and does all those things aside from video games.

192
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,399
Rym: She goes to TCAF every year to hang out with other comics friends.

193
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,960
Scott: And also because it's close to her parents' house and it's convenient.

194
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:16,498
Rym: Yeah, and it's usually around Mother's Day and Toronto is a pretty fun city, but I could never go because every year, right around that time, there's something in Hong Kong that I always had to do.

195
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:20,599
Rym: This year is the first time in like eight years I don't have to do the Hong Kong thing.

196
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:22,620
Rym: So I went to TCAF for the first time.

197
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,620
Scott: It doesn't feel like you've been going to TCAF for eight years.

198
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,678
Scott: Has it really been that long?

199
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:26,460
Rym: I don't know.

200
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,800
Rym: All I know is I have been going to this Hong Kong thing for eight years and it's always been on this time.

201
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,080
Rym: This is the first time I could have gone to TCAF.

202
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,678
Scott: And let me tell you, you could have gone nine years ago.

203
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,639
Rym: So you know how, but back then I think I had mocha.

204
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,980
Rym: Mocha isn't really like, I like mocha, but it doesn't scratch.

205
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,819
Scott: It's been decreasing over time.

206
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:51,918
Rym: Yeah, TCAF felt like the peak of mocha if that trajectory just kept going up.

207
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:53,720
Rym: TCAF is really great.

208
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,000
Scott: I know that it's great.

209
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,439
Scott: I've heard SPX is great also.

210
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,119
Rym: I'm not going to say you should fly to it.

211
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,040
Scott: Right, that's what I'm saying is it's still even as great as it is and which I totally believe.

212
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:08,260
Scott: It doesn't feel like the kind of thing where I would go for more than, you know, I walk around it for a few hours and then I'm done.

213
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:08,540
Scott: Right.

214
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:15,319
Rym: So even we'll see the reason we go, we walk around it for a few hours, but also all our friends are doing panels and the panels are actually really good.

215
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,400
Scott: And it still doesn't feel like it's worth going all the way to Toronto.

216
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,960
Rym: Unless you're going to also make it a Toronto vacation.

217
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,699
Scott: Like if I somehow made a comic, I would totally go.

218
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:27,140
Rym: Or you go, but do something else.

219
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,440
Rym: Like we also went to the hockey hall of fame and like went and saw a hockey opera called hockey noir.

220
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:34,878
Scott: I've heard of that.

221
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:35,880
Rym: We saw it.

222
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,400
Scott: I didn't know that it was coinciding.

223
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:40,760
Rym: It was there because it had some ties to TCAF because it was like a comic.

224
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:42,079
Scott: So you get to go to Canada.

225
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,100
Rym: So Emily and I went to this opera.

226
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,957
Rym: We're going to do a Patreon review of it.

227
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:47,858
Rym: It was, I really enjoyed it.

228
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,538
Scott: All right.

229
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:52,680
Rym: But it was both, it was corny on purpose.

230
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:53,340
Scott: I imagine.

231
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:53,680
Scott: Yes.

232
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,120
Rym: Like there's this narrator who keeps coming in.

233
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,940
Rym: He's the PI and it's very film noir.

234
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,259
Rym: So there's times where he just like, sometimes there's ice.

235
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,118
Rym: Sometimes there's black ice.

236
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,799
Rym: The trouble with the black ice is that you can't see it coming till it trips you up.

237
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:17,460
Rym: And it, it, it was, it was the right balance, but it also had some moments where I mean, as soon as you said, sometimes it's black ice.

238
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:24,179
Scott: I'd already knew the rest of the dialogue, even though I've never seen, but sometimes it was unintentionally funny.

239
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,900
Rym: But also have you ever, so have you ever seen opera?

240
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,640
Rym: Like you've seen, have you ever seen a full opera?

241
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:30,118
Scott: Yes.

242
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:34,020
Rym: Have you ever seen an, a full opera that is in English?

243
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:34,684
Scott: No.

244
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,320
Scott: So I saw one in Italian.

245
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,080
Rym: I have before I saw the magic flute in English.

246
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,539
Rym: So I've used to that.

247
00:16:43,383 --> 00:17:00,640
Rym: If you have never seen an opera in English and you speak English, it is really fucking hilarious and weird because the way English written opera tends to be is it sounds like I will kill the man who killed my friend and I will get hit.

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,020
Rym: Like it sounds like someone making fun of opera.

249
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,700
Scott: I'm sure that's what Italian opera sounds like to Italian people.

250
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,853
Rym: That's how opera is.

251
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:17,980
Rym: But very few people in like America ever hear an opera in English because usually performing it in the language it was written in is a way to avoid that problem.

252
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:29,720
Scott: I mean, that's why I tend to, you know, enjoy music written in other languages more with lyrics in other languages more because lyrics are distracting from music unless the lyrics are really damn good or really damn smooth.

253
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,659
Rym: Like stairway to heaven.

254
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,540
Rym: It's fine that that's in English, but like some Yumi Hamasaki song.

255
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:35,830
Rym: Okay.

256
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:41,100
Rym: You're singing about pop nonsense, but because I don't understand it directly, it sounds way better.

257
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,860
Scott: I mean, most K-pop is not any really better than Britney Spears garbage.

258
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,040
Scott: It's just because I don't know what the hell they're saying.

259
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,639
Scott: It's not, it's less asinine.

260
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,740
Rym: But TKF is super great.

261
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,480
Rym: The other interesting thing about it is that it's free and open to the public.

262
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,135
Rym: Just walk right in.

263
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Scott: Oh, I thought TKF cost money.

264
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:57,956
Scott: Nope.

265
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,517
Rym: Totally free.

266
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,340
Rym: It's in this giant public library.

267
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,557
Scott: You just walk in?

268
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,155
Rym: Just walk in.

269
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:03,318
Scott: How do they make money?

270
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:04,940
Scott: They're not selling badges.

271
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,739
Rym: Well, there's a bunch of tables like MOCA.

272
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:09,740
Scott: Oh, they make money from selling tables?

273
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:09,952
Scott: Yeah.

274
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,380
Rym: Also, I think that there's a bunch, there's a bunch of means that TKF has.

275
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,300
Scott: Is it paid for with Canadian socialism?

276
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,120
Rym: I assume Canadian socialism also has a part in that, but there was a huge number of tables.

277
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:24,080
Rym: It scratched every itch that MOCA used to scratch.

278
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,900
Rym: I got a bunch of weird zines and like fun stuff.

279
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:28,380
Scott: Well, MOCA was during PAX East this year.

280
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:28,940
Scott: We didn't, we didn't go.

281
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:29,479
Rym: Exactly.

282
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,299
Rym: So I had a lot of reasons to go to this thing.

283
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:33,540
Rym: It had the Danish comics pavilion.

284
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,460
Scott: Yeah.

285
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,680
Scott: I mean, MOCA always had a pavilion from some country.

286
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,055
Scott: Yep.

287
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,040
Rym: And it was pretty good.

288
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,420
Rym: There was a dude dressed in Roman armor talking about his Rome comic.

289
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:45,639
Rym: And I really want to read this comic now, but the comic is not in English.

290
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,260
Scott: Was it Rome armor made recently or actual Rome armor from Rome times?

291
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:51,600
Rym: He basically just had the helmet.

292
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:52,340
Scott: Oh, okay.

293
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,420
Scott: Was it an actual helmet from Rome?

294
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,400
Rym: No, I'm pretty sure the realm it was made recently.

295
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:56,860
Rym: Okay.

296
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:06,100
Rym: But the cool thing was in the Danish pavilion, there was a little note that was like, you know, every one of these is available for licensing with really good terms.

297
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:09,980
Rym: If you want to bring it into America or Canada and translate it into English.

298
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,260
Rym: Just saying, just saying.

299
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,559
Scott: Why don't you do that?

300
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,437
Rym: Maybe we should.

301
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:15,860
Scott: Some of these look pretty good.

302
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,900
Scott: You want to become a comics publisher?

303
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,900
Scott: Do you know anything about comics publishing?

304
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,680
Rym: Uh, I, I think about publishing.

305
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,459
Rym: I actually, I know a little bit and I know the right people.

306
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,720
Rym: Remember, I'm not, I'm not a good producer in this sense.

307
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,780
Rym: I have an executive producer assemble the people to do the thing and just take credit for it.

308
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,540
Scott: Publishing business.

309
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:33,979
Scott: Ain't easy.

310
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,794
Rym: No, it's not.

311
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,146
Scott: But any medium.

312
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:37,700
Rym: TCAF was pretty great.

313
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:46,940
Rym: And if you, if you can get to TCAF, like by driving there or taking a train, if you live close enough to Toronto, you definitely should be going to this thing.

314
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:52,500
Rym: I may go back next year because I have excuses to go to like after parties and all the stuff.

315
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,200
Rym: I don't think I'd go back every year if I was just going to the comic con.

316
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,439
Rym: But the fact that I can do all the other things means it's, it's pretty worth going to.

317
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,100
Rym: So in some other, uh, kind of surprising news, Rick and Morty, the cartoon is really popular.

318
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,514
Rym: I really, I'm a big fan of it.

319
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:11,360
Rym: Uh, but it got picked up for more episodes, which isn't necessarily news.

320
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,100
Rym: The show is super popular and makes a lot of money.

321
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,920
Rym: But what is surprising is that adult swim didn't just pick up another season.

322
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,993
Rym: They picked up 70 episodes.

323
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:22,459
Scott: How many seasons is that?

324
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:22,899
Scott: Like three.

325
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:25,220
Rym: Yeah, that, that's more than three.

326
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,214
Rym: The current seasons are like 10 to 13 episodes.

327
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,760
Scott: So it's like five or six seasons.

328
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,260
Rym: Yeah.

329
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,020
Rym: So 70 episodes for context, that is cowboy bebop plus utenna.

330
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:43,060
Scott: And then a little bit granted that is, uh, that show is not as expensive or difficult to produce as other animation.

331
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:44,625
Scott: It's not like.

332
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,296
Scott: it's super cheap or anything like $5 anime.

333
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,760
Rym: But you actually seen it, it's higher production value than you might expect.

334
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,939
Scott: Yeah, no, but it's not like fucking space dandy or some shit.

335
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,440
Scott: Uh, it's not ultra fancy high, you know, high, highest production value.

336
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,939
Scott: So like, you know, it probably costs like, you know, 20 to five to 30% less at least than, you know, a fancy show.

337
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:07,394
Scott: Yeah.

338
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,440
Scott: So the 70 of it, but I mean, also it's super popular.

339
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:16,560
Scott: Of course, you know, it's gonna make the money, especially since other shows are ending, you know, they want to at least keep, you know, they got all these new shows coming.

340
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,340
Scott: They got to keep some continuity of old shows continue.

341
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:23,759
Rym: So in some other sort of like, not really news, this is just an interesting thing that happened to me.

342
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:38,460
Rym: So on the way home from Zenkai Con, I was on an Amtrak and there was a big group of like late teens, like it seemed like 14 to 19 year olds, like a big group of them who all went to the con and they were super loud.

343
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:41,459
Rym: And I basically overheard their entire conversation on the entire ride.

344
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:51,079
Rym: But unlike say the typical naive anime con attendee, they sounded a lot like us when you, we used to go to a lot of cons and that they go to every anime con.

345
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:56,080
Rym: Like they go to Otakon, Anime Boston, like everything on the East coast, all the things we would do like Katsucon.

346
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,919
Scott: Their only crime is being born too late.

347
00:21:58,384 --> 00:21:58,540
Rym: Yup.

348
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:08,780
Rym: But the, as a result, I got a pretty interesting unfiltered set of reviews about the current state of anime cons now that, you know, we don't go to any anymore.

349
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:19,520
Rym: And I guess the really interesting thing I noticed was that they talked a lot about panels in particular and how they really like good panel content.

350
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:26,657
Rym: But in the last three or four years, I'm basically paraphrasing the exact things they said, like I'm not adding my own color to it.

351
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,979
Rym: Anime con panels have gone to shit and all the people who know what they're talking about are gone.

352
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:31,940
Scott: Yeah.

353
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,240
Scott: People like us and you know, and people smarter than us don't go to a lot of cons anymore.

354
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:44,260
Scott: And they made this funny point that who do go to the cons are fun, you know, to run and run content or punk kids who don't know what you're talking about.

355
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:50,759
Rym: And one of them said, and all the other ones like, Oh yeah, like why would I even bother going to Otakon anymore?

356
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,460
Rym: Zenkai con has just as good a panels because it's the same people doing the panels everywhere.

357
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:56,979
Rym: Yup.

358
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:04,019
Rym: And then they spent an hour dragging Otakon and they've been going to Otakon like longer than we went to Otakon.

359
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,480
Scott: Like these kids have been go, they were, we went from oh two to oh nine.

360
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,480
Rym: They were definitely at Otakon oh seven.

361
00:23:11,262 --> 00:23:14,340
Rym: So they were, they, they overlapped with us in terms of going to Otakon.

362
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:26,447
Rym: And they talked a lot about how the, all the content at Otakon has gone downhill to the point that the only reason to go, and they even said the words was to hang out in the lobby.

363
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,619
Rym: and now we don't even have that.

364
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:29,199
Scott: Oh, cause it moved.

365
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,277
Rym: Cause it moved.

366
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:35,180
Rym: And they started having this long debate about should they even bother going to Otakon anymore?

367
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,640
Rym: And then one of them said, we could just go to anime Boston.

368
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,100
Rym: And they all basically said the same thing.

369
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,080
Rym: We always say that anime Boston is the last great anime con on the East coast.

370
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:47,819
Scott: Oh, it's still an anime con.

371
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,559
Rym: It's I mean, and at least, you know, we don't go to anime Boston anymore either, but that's mostly because it's inconvenient to us.

372
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,639
Rym: Not because the anime content is bad there.

373
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,620
Rym: We only don't go honestly still because of the security checks.

374
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,780
Scott: That is the, that is one of the inconveniences.

375
00:24:02,981 --> 00:24:04,500
Scott: It's also like a whole weekend of my life.

376
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:14,780
Rym: I have to go to Boston, but it's a weekend where there's bad weather and we, it's not like we'd be biking or anything, but I'd say 80% of why we don't go to anime Boston anymore is because of the bag checks.

377
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:19,380
Rym: And the other 20% is usually PAX East and other stuff is right around that time.

378
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:21,819
Rym: And I need a weekend to deal with all that.

379
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:26,239
Rym: So, but they seem to agree that anime Boston is the last one worth going to.

380
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:34,420
Rym: And they had a pretty high opinion of katsu con, but then one of them, this is why I know their opinions are pretty quality was like, yeah, but why don't we just go to magfest?

381
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,440
Rym: It's like, we'll do the same thing there, but the everyone else is way cooler.

382
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:50,780
Rym: And they started getting a lot into like what they like about anime con panels and they seem to want informative panels or professionally run entertaining panels.

383
00:24:51,600 --> 00:25:01,259
Rym: And they are uninterested in 90% of panels because it's all just some attendee who's getting a free badge and talking about like the thing they care about that they don't actually know anything about.

384
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:01,611
Scott: Yes.

385
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,399
Scott: That's always been the case.

386
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:05,420
Rym: They don't care about the dances.

387
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,000
Rym: They don't care about any of that nonsense.

388
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,578
Scott: And they do someone does because they go into it.

389
00:25:09,886 --> 00:25:10,160
Scott: Yeah.

390
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:11,217
Rym: I don't know who.

391
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:15,578
Rym: And actually they talked about that and they didn't know who they're like, who goes to these things?

392
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:24,139
Rym: Like there's people we don't talk to that are, you know, uh, they, they speculated on, is it just people who don't know about dance clubs?

393
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,078
Scott: I don't know.

394
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,859
Rym: Like they just don't know punk kids.

395
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:27,859
Rym: Yeah.

396
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:34,920
Rym: But they actually, they had a really surprisingly high opinion of Zenkai con, like even more so than I would have expected.

397
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:43,139
Rym: And it seemed to come down to the fact that Zenkai con, unlike say these other anime cons is real cheap and trivial to go to.

398
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:58,960
Rym: And as far as their attendee experience is concerned, if you don't want to see the Japanese guests, they're basically the exact same experience for these kids who are too young to like go out drinking or do the stuff that like adults tend to do around cons.

399
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,660
Rym: Like they just want to hang out with their internet friends and talk about anime.

400
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:13,218
Scott: I mean, if it's a fan run con, you know, being bigger and having more money doesn't really allow them to provide content that a small con can't provide other than bringing in a big fancy guest.

401
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,260
Scott: It's like, what can Otakon do that a Zenkai con can't do?

402
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,440
Rym: Cause look, Zenkai con gets a GeekNights panel that Otakon doesn't.

403
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:30,180
Scott: So it's not, you know, it's like other than bringing in a big guest or having a premiere of a movie that everyone will be able to see soon.

404
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,280
Scott: If they want, like, if they honestly, like they do the AMV contest is in a bigger room.

405
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,157
Scott: Oh, they talked about that too.

406
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,080
Rym: Quote, who gives a fuck about the AMV contest?

407
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:41,220
Rym: I have YouTube.

408
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:47,199
Scott: But I mean, the point is, it's like same, most of it is same content, bigger room at a bigger con for more money.

409
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:47,425
Scott: Yup.

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:57,459
Scott: It's like, what's the, you know, if the con is big enough to have the content in the first place, it's not some really tiny con, then it's like, what's the difference between them if they're in the same geographic area.

411
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,300
Rym: But the big cons, the problem with them is that it's hard to get hotels.

412
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:02,400
Rym: It's hard.

413
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,377
Rym: It's expensive to go.

414
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:12,599
Rym: And the con doesn't actually offer them anything different that they care about because all they want to do is hang out with their friends and see good panels, bigger costs, better, bigger, better.

415
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,198
Scott: Cosplay people will be there.

416
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,036
Rym: Yeah.

417
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,280
Rym: They talked a lot about cosplay too, and they really care about that, but I don't really have strong opinions on cosplay.

418
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,560
Rym: So I don't, I didn't really follow it like that part of the conversation.

419
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,339
Rym: That's why I started playing slay the spire instead, but, uh, it was interesting.

420
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:29,260
Rym: because yeah, you're right.

421
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,560
Rym: The big cons, they can get the Japanese guest or the big voice actor.

422
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:43,759
Rym: Not that these kids cared about the voice actors, but they can't actually attract better normal panel content because there isn't any out there.

423
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,860
Rym: I mean, who are they getting anything?

424
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:45,316
Rym: Us.

425
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,780
Rym: They'll get anime world order.

426
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:47,518
Rym: Mike tool.

427
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:54,379
Rym: There's like a set of people who can do these good panels about anime and those people don't go to a lot of these anime cons anymore.

428
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,699
Scott: What if you paid them, but they don't, they're not paying for that because that's not what's bringing people in the door.

429
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,060
Rym: Yeah.

430
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:08,840
Rym: But like, I feel like Mike tool would be a bigger draw in Otakon than a lot of Japanese guests and especially more than a lot of the like voice actor style, I guess.

431
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,097
Rym: Cause those kids, those people who know what's up, the voice actor guests who go to the dance.

432
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,217
Rym: True.

433
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:25,097
Rym: But increasingly I want, I worry that the voice actor guests seem to draw the kinds of people who go to her con for one day or her too young to afford to go to a lot of cons and there's a self-limiting audience there.

434
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:47,059
Rym: But I guess my meta point is that we, Scott and I are old enough and interact less and less with the weed anime culture that still goes to cons that it was very interesting to hear a pretty large group of kids who were younger than us talking about their experiences at cons in an unfiltered way among themselves and just being the creepy old guy, listening to their conversation and taking notes.

435
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,760
Rym: And I feel like our opinions are like, we still have a pretty good tap on like that demographic.

436
00:28:53,182 --> 00:29:03,518
Scott: Also, I've pretty much never trust when Rym tells like an anecdote of something he heard someone else saying, cause he does this all, he does this all the time and provides, you know, no proof or whatever.

437
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,659
Scott: Well, I mean, and it's, you know, first of all, even if it's true, it's anecdotal evidence.

438
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:17,080
Rym: My sample size is a group of eight kids who appeared to be between 14 and 19 and it's been, and even if it's true, it's been through a Rym filter.

439
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,080
Scott: Real often be like, Oh, I overheard this and this and this to try to create evidence to support his own ideas.

440
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,239
Scott: That is a remove.

441
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:30,760
Rym: But I also, I only took notes on the pant, like the stuff I cared about because when they started talking about cosplay, I just like half listened.

442
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:37,440
Rym: They, they, the, the only things I remember they said about cosplay were that that's the only good thing of, that's the only good thing.

443
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,540
Rym: Katsucon has was what they said about cosplay.

444
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,580
Scott: Well, Katsucon is like the cosplays.

445
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,740
Rym: And they said, nobody knows how to make a costume for shit at Zenkai Con.

446
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:53,899
Rym: But, uh, I guess I could have recorded their conversation, but I think that would have gone above the line to creepy.

447
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,639
Scott: I mean, you're already creepy.

448
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:05,899
Rym: I think that would have been, that would have been over the line, but anyway, things of the day.

449
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:13,480
Rym: So I'm a, I'm a fan of, well, of useful memes and the, is this a pigeon meme that's been making the rounds lately.

450
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:20,220
Rym: And I, I particularly enjoy it, but, uh, some, normally there's like the know your meme things.

451
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,739
Rym: I'm going to go do the research, like, wait, where did this meme come from?

452
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:23,940
Rym: And like that sort of thing.

453
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:36,160
Rym: But the story of where this meme came from was pretty funny because a lot of people who are using this meme didn't realize that the screenshot, the, is this a pigeon with the guy looking at what is clearly a butterfly.

454
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:41,660
Rym: They did not realize that that is the actual subtitle from that actual anime.

455
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:51,968
Rym: And it turns out the person who fansubbed, not just who fansubbed this anime, but who specifically did this fansub.

456
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:57,770
Rym: like they're the ones who typed the words, is this a pigeon and did like the genlock or whatever it is?

457
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,779
Rym: you did to make a fansub back then.

458
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:09,100
Rym: They discovered recently that this is a meme and they thought it was funny because they'd actually fansubbed it and they'd like went around and got interviewed and everything.

459
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:16,800
Rym: But basically the deal with this meme is that this is from an anime that I actually had never seen, but I've heard of it.

460
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:20,700
Scott: There's a, there's a series of shows called the brave series, like brave.

461
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:23,140
Scott: I think Gao Gai Gar is included in that series.

462
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,780
Rym: Brave of the sun fiber.

463
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,020
Scott: So this is like a whole series of robot shows called brave something, something.

464
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,955
Scott: And this is one of them.

465
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,415
Rym: Yep.

466
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,619
Rym: But basically this is a pretty in-depth look at like where this meme came from and it's all the stuff around it.

467
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:46,640
Rym: But the reason why this kid clearly does not know what a pigeon or a butterfly is, is that he's an android trying to pretend to be a human.

468
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,300
Rym: And I haven't seen the show, but apparently he really sucks at pretending to be a human.

469
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,880
Scott: I saw the clip, uh, like the video clip of the fansub surrounding the whole scene.

470
00:31:57,302 --> 00:32:00,859
Scott: And basically there's a, the, the android kid is living at this professor's house.

471
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:05,160
Scott: It was professors taking care of him and gave him the clothes and stuff and disguise.

472
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,040
Scott: And there's also some kids living at the professor's house cause it's a robot show.

473
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,280
Scott: And there's a detective who's snooping around.

474
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,619
Scott: The detective bumps into the android kid and starts questioning him out.

475
00:32:14,022 --> 00:32:16,619
Scott: And that's why this dialogue eventually occurs.

476
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:25,060
Rym: So yeah, now you know, but the fact that it's someone pretending to be human who isn't could color your perception of some of the uses of this meme.

477
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,239
Rym: So you got to think of the day.

478
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:27,810
Scott: Yeah.

479
00:32:29,726 --> 00:32:34,218
Scott: So, uh, so the original like Lego set, you know, the one with the blue spaceship with the planet on it.

480
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:34,979
Scott: Oh yeah.

481
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:41,866
Scott: So somebody took that theme of the original blue spaceship and Lego and made a pinball machine.

482
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,179
Scott: that is that theme.

483
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:53,080
Scott: But the pinball machine is basically 100% Lego, but it's actually a working pinball machine, 100% working with scorekeeping and flippers and everything.

484
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,520
Rym: Scorekeeping is pretty impressive.

485
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,880
Scott: I guess I don't know if the metal ball is actually from a Lego set.

486
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:10,320
Scott: It could be, uh, I'd give them that if they didn't, if they got Lego technique, they got Lego mind storm, they got, you know, all Lego stuff, uh, to make this pinball machine.

487
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,400
Scott: And yes, it is a 100, even the, even the, you know, the, the table is Lego.

488
00:33:14,923 --> 00:33:15,759
Scott: Everything is Lego.

489
00:33:16,503 --> 00:33:18,280
Scott: It's a fucking Lego pinball machine.

490
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,856
Scott: Oh my God.

491
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:20,540
Rym: This is pretty amazing.

492
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,078
Scott: You can actually play it for reals.

493
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:29,599
Rym: Also, this, this website has the appropriate as, as many screenshots and pictures of this as you want to explore it.

494
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,177
Scott: This video of it, you can see the insides, the outsides, the top sides, the, you know, the whole thing.

495
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:34,537
Rym: Yup.

496
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,699
Scott: There are no secrets.

497
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,300
Rym: So in the moment, the GeekNights book is still Emily Wilson's new translation.

498
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,506
Rym: Odyssey.

499
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,020
Rym: Have you read any more of it?

500
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,338
Scott: I have read more Odyssey.

501
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,080
Rym: Okay.

502
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:47,300
Rym: I will then work to finish the Odyssey.

503
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,059
Scott: He's on the Island with, uh, Nausicaa.

504
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,880
Scott: And, uh, I guess his, her, her parents are chilling or whatever.

505
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:59,179
Scott: We're going to make an awesome boat for you to go on Odyssey with that right around.

506
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:01,200
Rym: there is where I paused waiting for you to start reading against.

507
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,019
Rym: I'll start reading again.

508
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:02,680
Rym: We'll probably finish.

509
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,779
Scott: They're going to give Odysseus a boat so he can go on an Odyssey.

510
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,415
Rym: Yup.

511
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:10,260
Rym: And then we're going to get the, the, the stuff that we all remember.

512
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,540
Scott: Cause apparently like we learned where the pop up books.

513
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:13,139
Rym: Yup.

514
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,360
Rym: No one remembers Telemachus is like pre Odysseus arc.

515
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,799
Rym: Like no one seemed to have read that part in high school for some reason.

516
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:21,293
Rym: Yeah.

517
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:24,458
Rym: I'm really liking this translation and you should read it.

518
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:24,900
Rym: Definitely.

519
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,719
Scott: We'll do a very easy to read compared to old timey translation.

520
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,879
Rym: And also, you know, we have a book club.

521
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:36,000
Scott: We've actually done a ton of books over the last, even though it seems to take forever to do any individual book club book.

522
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:37,820
Scott: It feels like we do like two a year.

523
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,299
Rym: Like we've done a lot.

524
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,139
Scott: GeekNights has been going on so long.

525
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,559
Scott: The book club has been going on so long.

526
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,498
Scott: We have actually somehow accumulated many Rebecca.

527
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:56,580
Rym: I mean, if I go back, we had five pages of the stuff, the great Gatsby one Q 84 foundation, the lives of Locke Lamora, farewell to arms, Steppenwolf.

528
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:56,955
Rym: Oh yeah.

529
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,859
Rym: We did Steppenwolf.

530
00:34:58,042 --> 00:34:58,212
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:34:59,121 --> 00:34:59,418
Rym: Yeah.

532
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:03,179
Rym: I just, I suddenly just remembered Steppenwolf.

533
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:03,897
Scott: Uh huh.

534
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,359
Rym: It's a pretty good ending there.

535
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,059
Scott: Good band.

536
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,411
Rym: Yeah.

537
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,379
Rym: Good band.

538
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,756
Scott: Good book.

539
00:35:09,162 --> 00:35:09,940
Scott: Song's still relevant.

540
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,100
Scott: You could think they were written yesterday.

541
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,139
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

542
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,460
Rym: Follow the GeekNights book club and follow GeekNights and all those places.

543
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:18,780
Rym: Scott's got a YouTube channel.

544
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,758
Scott: Even if you don't follow units book club, read some books.

545
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,470
Scott: Yeah.

546
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,136
Rym: I read a book.

547
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:24,739
Scott: It's my better use of your time to listen to this shit.

548
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,680
Rym: Not a sports page, not a magazine book.

549
00:35:31,343 --> 00:35:34,959
Rym: So we, uh, I've, Scott hasn't watched made in abyss yet, so we can't review that.

550
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,179
Scott: I think we could do a show on a Gretsuko cause I've seen two episodes and that's enough.

551
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:38,958
Rym: Yeah.

552
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:40,560
Rym: A Gretsuko is okay.

553
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,638
Scott: And that's a hot show right now.

554
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:42,419
Rym: It's all right.

555
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:44,680
Rym: I only watched one episode.

556
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,177
Scott: So why don't we do a show on it right now?

557
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,699
Rym: Cause I got, I have almost nothing to say about it.

558
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,360
Scott: Okay.

559
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:50,980
Rym: It's okay.

560
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,237
Scott: I could do a show on it.

561
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,218
Rym: The people I, people are talking about it like the characters have very touching, meaningful arcs.

562
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,657
Rym: And I do not know if that is true because I've only watched one episode and I've seen two episodes.

563
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,379
Rym: Yeah.

564
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:04,418
Rym: So maybe three.

565
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:04,959
Scott: I don't remember.

566
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:05,540
Rym: Yeah.

567
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:08,960
Rym: I have not seen enough to have any opinion other than it's okay.

568
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,717
Rym: It's cute.

569
00:36:10,623 --> 00:36:12,079
Rym: Uh, I like the characters.

570
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:17,240
Rym: It seems to have more of a contiguous story than Detroit metal city.

571
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:20,553
Scott: And it's not the only relation to Detroit metal city is.

572
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:23,260
Scott: it has the trope of character who is on the surface.

573
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,380
Scott: Nothing like heavy metal sings heavy metal.

574
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:28,659
Rym: It isn't just the same joke over and over and over again.

575
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,880
Scott: It's contains no other similarities with Detroit metal city on that.

576
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,939
Rym: But it isn't just like, here's the joke or she has to bring coffee and now she's mad and then she does death metal.

577
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:42,100
Rym: Here's the joke where she gets like almost fired and then she sings death metal.

578
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:44,040
Rym: Actually, there's more to it than just that.

579
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:49,759
Rym: It's not just a series of vignettes, but I have nothing else to say about it cause I have only seen one episode.

580
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:50,199
Rym: All right.

581
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,039
Rym: Do you have any, do you have anything more to say?

582
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,077
Scott: I could talk about it for a whole episode, but apparently Go for it.

583
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:56,179
Rym: We can do that instead.

584
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,799
Scott: Oh, are we going to do that instead?

585
00:36:58,346 --> 00:36:59,278
Rym: I got nothing to say though.

586
00:36:59,681 --> 00:37:00,038
Scott: You sure?

587
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:01,140
Rym: I saw one episode.

588
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,797
Rym: What do you want me to say?

589
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:02,740
Scott: All right.

590
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,718
Scott: So first of all, right.

591
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,800
Scott: So this show is made by Sanrio, which is the Hello Kitty company.

592
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:14,149
Scott: And they're also making this, which seems somewhat close to Hello Kitty and sort of the character design.

593
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:15,660
Scott: art wiseness, right?

594
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:22,920
Scott: Where the sort of like the simple thick line art style, but yet so far away from anything you would consider to be Hello Kitty.

595
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:23,560
Scott: Right.

596
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:27,720
Scott: But it's, it seems like it's going to have the merchandising of Hello Kitty, right?

597
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,100
Scott: There's already a Gretsuko merch up the wazoo, uh, if you look online.

598
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:32,920
Scott: Right.

599
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,579
Scott: So in that you can see all the different characters in the show.

600
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:47,100
Scott: When you look at them, it's like, they all have all these really distinctive designs, but like once you, if you think, cause I, you know, that the fact that it's a Sanrio show, right.

601
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:48,379
Scott: Was like stuck in my mind.

602
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:54,240
Scott: It's like, as I'm watching, it's like, you can see how all the characters are so mergeable.

603
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:55,979
Scott: They're designed to be mergeable.

604
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,520
Rym: I mean, that's the Sanrio play.

605
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,200
Scott: Even more so than the way robots are mergeable.

606
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,900
Rym: That that Sanrio, here's characters and here's the characters merge.

607
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,980
Scott: Gretsuko is all about the merge.

608
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:13,660
Scott: And once you see that the rest of the show sort of falls together and we're like, ah, I see these characters are so different and different stereotypes, right?

609
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,600
Scott: This is the other coworker who's just chill or at least seems to be chill, right?

610
00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:26,500
Scott: You know, the male coworker who seems like normal boring guy, the annoying hippo lady, right?

611
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,162
Scott: The totally cool, bad ass, taller ladies who only walk down the hall and that's all they do.

612
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,520
Scott: The evil boss pig guy.

613
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:42,796
Scott: It's like every character is like something that somebody is going to relate to or want in some form of merchant, some way, right?

614
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:50,099
Scott: Like they can sell that pig boss guy as like a stress relieving squeezy thing, right?

615
00:38:52,100 --> 00:39:09,638
Scott: But yeah, it's interesting how the show, while it's got these sort of like, you know, character designs that are so simple, actually is like carrying a full plot, like the pacing of it and the plot lines and structure of the episodes feels like any other, like a real show.

616
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:24,579
Rym: So, you know, having only seen one episode though, half the people I've talked to who decided to watch the whole show are acting like it's a really serious touching like adulthood story and like it's a, like it's a really good thought provoking show.

617
00:39:25,222 --> 00:39:32,460
Rym: And the other half of the people I've talked to said that it kind of just doesn't go anywhere and everyone's making a really big deal about it for nothing.

618
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,960
Rym: It's mostly just a comedy.

619
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,200
Scott: Yeah.

620
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,919
Scott: I don't think that it's a, I don't know yet from the number of episodes, I don't even remember the number of episodes I've seen.

621
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,682
Rym: There's like

622
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:47,111
Scott: 10 and so that usually when you see a show animated in such a simple way with this kind of style and that sort of hook, it's just

623
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:47,513
Rym: like you

624
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:58,480
Scott: expected to be one of those things with short episodes where just sort of, you know, scenes and incidents and whatever and not this sort of, you know, it continues.

625
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:14,599
Scott: It's like, you know, like she, you know, there's the character who is the sort of childhood friend who is irresponsible and it's like the plot carries from episode to episode in this continuity, which like you don't expect to match up with, you know, the animation style and such.

626
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:14,939
Scott: Right.

627
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:31,640
Scott: It's like, imagine if I took like a real, a real, you know, sort of show Joe anime plot and just, and I just bang the microphone into my tooth, you know, but you animated it in like the same way you would animate something like Domiko.

628
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:32,330
Scott: Yeah.

629
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,180
Scott: Right.

630
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:42,360
Rym: Which is I would argue has at least based on the first episode of Gretsuko, almost a similar level of character arcs, got a million different characters.

631
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,079
Scott: Gretsuko has more going on than Domiko.

632
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:44,844
Scott: Yeah.

633
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:48,239
Rym: I mean, I've only seen one episode that I don't know.

634
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:49,839
Rym: I don't know how far it goes.

635
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:50,596
Scott: Yeah.

636
00:40:50,700 --> 00:41:03,719
Scott: But you know, there's this, I think the thing that people like about a Gretsuko is that it touches on things that, you know, people, even people our age are actually like feeling and dealing with in everyday life.

637
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,600
Rym: And like, like some of those Jose manga, there's like, here's normal life for an adult.

638
00:41:07,743 --> 00:41:07,860
Scott: Right.

639
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,000
Scott: In like very modern, you know, present day times.

640
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:18,880
Scott: Like, you know, it hits home for people who have jobs today who are our age, where we're not like bosses in charge.

641
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,064
Scott: Right.

642
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:19,955
Scott: Yeah.

643
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:24,740
Scott: We're not that old, but we're also not, you know, like interns or whatever, you know?

644
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:28,900
Scott: She's got to deal with issues like, you know, misogynist boss.

645
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:39,320
Scott: They got to deal with issues like, you know, people pile and work on you, deal with issues like why am I sitting in an office job when I could be out living a real life?

646
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,360
Scott: Should I just quit?

647
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:47,818
Scott: All these things that like, you know, people who are watching actually relate to in everyday life are happening in this show.

648
00:41:48,392 --> 00:41:48,580
Scott: Right.

649
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,239
Scott: Which wouldn't happen with most anime ever.

650
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:51,840
Rym: Yeah.

651
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,520
Rym: Well, because most anime, I mean, even the anime.

652
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:02,340
Rym: Evangelion, the main characters, these teenagers, but the adult characters are mostly like in their twenties.

653
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:11,960
Scott: I think actually, you know, when I think about it, I can't think of an anime that I can actually relate to in my real everyday life more than a Gretsuko ever.

654
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:13,240
Scott: Oh, let's see.

655
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:13,937
Scott: What anime?

656
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,916
Rym: Count of Monte Cristo.

657
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:16,342
Scott: No.

658
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,319
Rym: Well, you don't have long term, you don't have long term ridiculously complex plans for revenge against people who slighted you 20 years ago.

659
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:32,840
Scott: I mean, there might be individual things in an anime here or there that I might be able to relate to, even crazy fantasy ones.

660
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:40,120
Scott: So like, you know, in Galaxy Express, I can relate to the do I want a robot body, but oh, the woes of immortality.

661
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:45,880
Scott: But there's, you know, in terms of my everyday actual human life on Earth.

662
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:46,680
Scott: Right.

663
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,739
Scott: It's like there's no anime that I know of that matches up more than a Gretsuko does.

664
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:54,119
Rym: I'm thinking about it.

665
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,619
Rym: So I'm trying to think of an anime now.

666
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:03,339
Rym: I mean, there's a lot of generic anime from like a decade ago that were kind of like.

667
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,780
Rym: I'm trying to think of one that actually fits my life, though, that are just adults doing a thing and they don't really have a particular strong plot.

668
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,060
Rym: Like kids on the slope did what didn't seem like it was really going anywhere in particular.

669
00:43:15,521 --> 00:43:19,360
Rym: But if you were a musician, it might be like you might be able to relate to it.

670
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,220
Scott: But this relates to a lot of people.

671
00:43:21,423 --> 00:43:22,779
Scott: Dealing with office shit.

672
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,918
Scott: It's like Dilbert, but not off.

673
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:25,720
Rym: Yeah.

674
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:26,740
Scott: Right.

675
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,140
Scott: You know, it's like Dilbert updated for twenty eighteen.

676
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:29,959
Scott: Not awful.

677
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,960
Scott: Female perspective.

678
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,200
Scott: Also, Japan perspective.

679
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,240
Scott: Also, also funny.

680
00:43:34,785 --> 00:43:35,578
Rym: Yeah, I can see that.

681
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,740
Scott: But it's really interesting, you know, as for all Dilbert's problems, you know, in its day, it was relatable for office people.

682
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,820
Scott: I'm just going to find a Dilbert comic that related to your work situation.

683
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,799
Rym: I just see a really wide split between people who say it's really overrated and people who are really relating to it.

684
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:51,659
Scott: I don't know.

685
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:54,738
Scott: I mean, how overrated it is depends on how rated it is.

686
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,020
Scott: I think if people are saying it's like phenomenal, unbelievable, then yes, that's overrated.

687
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:13,520
Rym: I guess what will be really interesting is it being on Netflix and with the Sanrio cache, will there be a lot of people who we won't see who watch it because it's on Netflix, but who might not even think of it as anime?

688
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:20,900
Rym: Like they just click on it and they watch this show in English dubbed about this person working and relate to it.

689
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,960
Scott: There is a problem, right?

690
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:23,660
Scott: And I didn't realize this problem.

691
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,560
Scott: I haven't I don't know if anyone else has commented on this.

692
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,240
Scott: We went to Netflix.

693
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,856
Scott: He turned it on.

694
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:28,760
Scott: Yeah, I chose Japanese audio English.

695
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:30,820
Rym: I just watched the dub on the first episode.

696
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,140
Rym: Didn't even try to watch the subtitles.

697
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,540
Scott: I mean, if I turn on anime, I'm going to try subtitles.

698
00:44:36,403 --> 00:44:38,860
Scott: And what happened was is there were some subtitles.

699
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:46,199
Scott: But there was also this narrator talking and it realized after like a minute, like, hey, the subtitles aren't broken.

700
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:51,240
Scott: They're just only subtitling the characters and the narrator isn't being subbed.

701
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,140
Scott: The narrator wasn't getting subbed at all.

702
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,719
Scott: And I was like, what the hell's up with that?

703
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,480
Scott: Why isn't the narrator being subtitled?

704
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,039
Scott: So then I'm like, well, I guess we had to watch the dub.

705
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,420
Scott: So you rewind, go back to the beginning, turn on the dub and there's no narrator.

706
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:13,040
Scott: And I realized that those were dub titles, dub titles, not subtitles.

707
00:45:13,762 --> 00:45:15,620
Scott: Basically, they were closed captions for the dub.

708
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:16,920
Scott: They weren't subtitles.

709
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,845
Scott: And it must be.

710
00:45:19,905 --> 00:45:24,620
Scott: the Japanese is actually probably quite significantly different because it has a narrator.

711
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,059
Scott: That's a huge difference to begin with.

712
00:45:26,345 --> 00:45:26,960
Rym: So it's Blade Runner.

713
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,360
Scott: That's completely absent.

714
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,759
Rym: We got the Blade Runner problem now.

715
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:38,940
Scott: So I really would like to watch the show with that narrator and with subtitles of the narrator and the characters to see if it gives a different impression at all.

716
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:48,517
Rym: So kind of an aside, but there's a similar but different problem with the because we were watching made in the biz, which is on the Amazon dub, actually not a bad dub.

717
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:51,499
Rym: dub sounded fine, but so we were watching made in the biz.

718
00:45:51,842 --> 00:45:53,479
Scott: It doesn't even sound like an anime dub.

719
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,300
Scott: Like people do those characters pretty well, but it's on Amazon.

720
00:45:58,002 --> 00:46:02,240
Rym: And the way Amazon works, if you start watching it, it's just in Japanese, no subtitles.

721
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:02,733
Rym: Fuck you.

722
00:46:03,423 --> 00:46:05,400
Rym: So you got to go and be like enable subtitles.

723
00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:08,680
Rym: But Amazon then remembers that globally.

724
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:17,280
Rym: So then later, like weeks later, days later, you watch some like some American show and the English subtitles are there and you got to go turn it off.

725
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,160
Rym: There's like no intelligent defaults there.

726
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:24,059
Rym: So you have to turn them off every time you watch something in English and turn them on every time you watch something in Japanese.

727
00:46:24,441 --> 00:46:39,240
Scott: I mean, you should be able to just configure like, hey, I speak only to English, but I want to hear original audio on this, whatever the original language was, Indian, Turkish, Russian, but as an aside, the original audio, but I only speak it English.

728
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,120
Rym: So remember, there's these tropes of like old anime fandom.

729
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:50,799
Rym: So like when you watch an anime, like a VHS tape that had four episodes, the first episode, the opener would show the Romangi.

730
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:57,019
Rym: Then the second time when he watched the second episode, the opener would show the actual, like here I got like the characters.

731
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:59,860
Rym: Then the third time you watch it, it'd be the translation.

732
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:01,920
Rym: And then the fourth episode would be clear.

733
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,019
Rym: There'd be no subtitles.

734
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:03,298
Rym: Yeah.

735
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,647
Scott: And DVDs, what they would do is often just put the.

736
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,359
Scott: the the pure unadulterated opening is like a DVD extra.

737
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:10,800
Scott: Yeah.

738
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,460
Scott: So and then the the actual opener would just be subtitled normally.

739
00:47:14,741 --> 00:47:15,920
Rym: Amazon does that.

740
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,080
Rym: There's a weeb advising them somewhere.

741
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:23,120
Rym: Amazon, every episode, it rotates through all those possible options.

742
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,240
Scott: See what fansubbers do these days, it seems.

743
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:26,420
Rym: They put them all there once.

744
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,220
Scott: I mean, I haven't seen fansubs in a while because it's just everything streaming.

745
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:29,800
Rym: Yeah, I just don't.

746
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,298
Scott: Fansubs have been, you know, for quite a few years, just put all the different.

747
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:41,596
Scott: they put the karaoke, the English, the the, you know, the Japanese characters and the Romangi up there all at once.

748
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,219
Scott: All at the same time.

749
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,533
Scott: Cover ten different colors for the karaoke part.

750
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:46,767
Scott: Yeah.

751
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:49,079
Scott: You know, and then they they're kind of waiting.

752
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,108
Scott: You can't see the opener because all this you got five different subtitle tracks at once.

753
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:56,778
Scott: But that's what they do on the closer to.

754
00:47:57,143 --> 00:47:57,351
Rym: Yep.

755
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,340
Rym: But yeah, I'm really curious to watch the rest of this to see where I fall.

756
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,319
Scott: It's like on the one hand, I kind of want to see where it goes because it has this sort of continuing plot that I can relate to.

757
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,120
Scott: But on the other hand, I like I stopped after I don't know.

758
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:19,900
Scott: I can't remember if it was two or three or four episodes I watched and I didn't have like a strong desire to keep going.

759
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,900
Scott: See, that's the thing we all just want instead of watching it.

760
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,519
Scott: Somebody just tell me what happens.

761
00:48:24,721 --> 00:48:25,304
Rym: See, that's the.

762
00:48:25,585 --> 00:48:31,280
Rym: that's one of the metrics I get used to judging anime again when I start watching like, you know, I got to watch four episodes of show to review it.

763
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:38,480
Rym: But what my one of my main metrics is after I force myself to watch for how strongly do I want to watch the fifth episode?

764
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:45,820
Rym: Like Initial D as dumb as I thought it was, I wanted to watch that fifth episode desperately as dumb as your pedal is right now.

765
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,084
Scott: I really like.

766
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:51,252
Scott: I have a desire to watch the next episode and see what the bug is going to have.

767
00:48:51,502 --> 00:48:51,631
Rym: Yep.

768
00:48:52,102 --> 00:48:52,780
Rym: Like made in the best.

769
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:53,939
Rym: What's the deal with the show?

770
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,919
Rym: And I watch four episodes.

771
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,039
Rym: Really wanted to watch the fifth episode to see what happens.

772
00:48:58,964 --> 00:48:59,498
Rym: You should watch it.

773
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,139
Rym: We could do a show on that one.

774
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,339
Scott: I got too much stuff going on.

775
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,000
Rym: Dude, the show is only like 12 episodes long.

776
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:05,576
Scott: Oh, is it?

777
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:07,019
Scott: Oh, it's not long.

778
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:07,595
Scott: That helps.

779
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,859
Rym: And while there might be a second season, the first season, it ends.

780
00:49:11,306 --> 00:49:11,678
Scott: That helps.

781
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,519
Rym: And it tells enough of a story.

782
00:49:15,463 --> 00:49:16,110
Rym: And it's not.

783
00:49:16,312 --> 00:49:16,980
Rym: it's not bad.

784
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:17,697
Rym: It's a good show.

785
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:20,478
Rym: Like we watched it and I enjoyed it.

786
00:49:21,364 --> 00:49:22,540
Rym: And it's a terrible secret space.

787
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:29,400
Rym: And they go the the ship of the show is heading straight for the terrible secret at the highest possible velocity.

788
00:49:30,022 --> 00:49:32,059
Rym: It's like, hey, there's a pit there with a secret in it.

789
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:33,719
Rym: Episode two, we're going down the pit.

790
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:34,938
Rym: Never look back.

791
00:49:35,204 --> 00:49:35,574
Rym: Let's go.

792
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:37,631
Rym: Yeah.

793
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,190
Rym: All right.

794
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:40,359
Rym: I guess we can just stop there.

795
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,340
Rym: I got nothing else to say about it.

796
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:41,719
Rym: Good to go.

797
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,219
Scott: I told you we could do a whole show on it.

798
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:45,460
Rym: Only because we went way long on the news.

799
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,819
Scott: Can we redo the opener now?

800
00:49:47,704 --> 00:49:48,460
Rym: Oh, yeah, I guess we should.

801
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:55,030
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

802
00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:00,169
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Cat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

803
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:05,570
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

804
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:08,490
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

805
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:13,250
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

807
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,030
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

808
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:24,210
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

809
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:04,729
Rym: Come on.

810
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:24,368
Rym: Yeah, we probably will only have one episode next week as I got to fly to Quantico to see my brother's graduation from the FBI.

811
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:27,948
Rym: So I leave you with this.
