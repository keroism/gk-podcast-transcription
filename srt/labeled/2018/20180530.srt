1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,380
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 30th, 2018.

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,262
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:12,924
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:14,690
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,094
Rym: Wotakoi.

6
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:18,150
Rym: Love is hard for the otaku.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,858
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,730
Rym: So we, uh, we've been fans of anime for a long time.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,740
Rym: I've been a fan of anime since I was in like fourth grade.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,410
Scott: I've been a fan of anime since the last millennia.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,569
Rym: But, uh, The thing about anime is that there's bad anime out there.

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:50,543
Rym: If I, if someone asks me, because Darryl Surratt tweeted the other day, and his tweet was like, "What was that one anime, the first one you saw, that was bad?

13
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:52,849
Rym: Like, bad to where you realized it was

14
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:53,090
Rym: bad?".

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:03,750
Rym: 'Cause I will admit, there was a time before I'd seen enough anime to really understand what made a quality show, where I would watch literally any garbage anime I could get my hands on.

16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,090
Rym: No,

17
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:13,090
Scott: actually, when I was watching in the last millennia on the sci-fi channel, right, there were some, there were many great things that were viewed there, such as Dominion Tank Police,

18
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,541
Rym: and Vampire Hunter D, Project Aco,

19
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,686
Scott: Galaxy Express, the

20
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:18,570
Rym: first Tenchi movie,

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,539
Scott: and then there was like some Fatal Fury movie, which

22
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:22,703
Rym: was

23
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:27,889
Scott: obviously not as good as the other things, and it was based on a fighting game, and yes, I knew it was bad.

24
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:32,410
Scott: And I did not want to watch it again, even though I wanted to watch more anime.

25
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,489
Rym: But I watched them anyway, just after the fact, I'd be like, "Eh, that wasn't so

26
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:37,870
Rym: great.".

27
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:41,007
Rym: But at the same time, I would still be like, "Yeah, but it was anime, I watched some

28
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:41,450
Rym: anime.".

29
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,365
Scott: No, I knew that Fatal Fury movie was bad, but...

30
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:45,328
Rym: Well, you got an anime later than me.

31
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:46,148
Scott: What do you mean?

32
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:49,190
Rym: I was starved to get ahold of any anime I could.

33
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:53,130
Scott: It was sci-fi channels as early as pretty much most people.

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:53,691
Rym: Yeah.

35
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:58,466
Rym: So, the anime, there's two anime that come to mind.

36
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:01,265
Rym: when someone asks me, "Hey, what's a really bad

37
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:01,649
Rym: anime?".

38
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:02,910
Scott: Gray Digital Target?

39
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,090
Rym: Gray Digital Target.

40
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,990
Rym: And not O'Dean, because while O'Dean is bad, it's just boring bad.

41
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,868
Rym: We've talked about that.

42
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,549
Scott: I haven't even seen O'Dean, I've only seen clips of O'Dean.

43
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:13,170
Rym: Wow, really?

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,030
Scott: What, you've watched O'Dean?

45
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,850
Rym: Yeah, of course I've watched O'Dean.

46
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,168
Rym: I've watched Oden on sci-fi.

47
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:20,689
Scott: It was real long and boring.

48
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,309
Scott: All right, well, good for you.

49
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,904
Scott: That wasn't even a full version.

50
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:24,966
Scott: Good for me.

51
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:39,790
Rym: But the other one that comes to mind pretty much immediately is not only the worst anime, one of the worst anime I can think of, it is, without any hesitation, I will say that it is the worst Lupin thing ever.

52
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:45,250
Rym: It is Lupin the Third, the Legend of the Gold of Babylon.

53
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:49,370
Scott: I mean, I don't know, I haven't seen all the Lupin things, so I can't say that for sure.

54
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:56,550
Rym: I say that having seen a lot of the Free Fujiko Mine more recent Lupins that are pretty fucking bad.

55
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,010
Scott: I've seen lots of Lupin and I can say that is a bad Lupin movie.

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,870
Rym: I mean, Columbus Egg gives it a run for its money.

57
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,970
Scott: But I mean, it's creative as it has more value than Grey Digital Target.

58
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,530
Rym: Yeah, but if I had to watch this again or Grey Digital Target again.

59
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,228
Scott: I'd watch this again.

60
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:18,630
Rym: I might watch Grey Digital Target again, I'm not sure.

61
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,369
Scott: I would not.

62
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:22,010
Scott: Why would I watch Grey Digital Target again?

63
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,679
Scott: Because my memory of Grey Digital Target is so hazy.

64
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,770
Rym: Literally, I remember exactly two things about Grey Digital Target.

65
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:42,990
Rym: I remember the cyborg grandpa, who all that was left of him was a torso and one arm, somehow climbing that cliff, letting go, not falling, and continuing to climb with one arm.

66
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,330
Scott: It's like that video game where the guy is in a barrel with a hammer.

67
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:54,809
Rym: And the other thing I remember is that instead of ending, the movie just stops and then the credits just appear.

68
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:56,570
Scott: No, there's some text on the still frame.

69
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,787
Rym: With this text that says like, "10 minutes later, the base was

70
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:01,370
Rym: destroyed.".

71
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,344
Rym: And then it kind of gets wavy.

72
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,130
Rym: I literally don't remember anything else about Grey Digital Target.

73
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,310
Rym: Who was the target?

74
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:08,969
Rym: Was there a color other than Grey?

75
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,250
Rym: I have no idea what that thing was about.

76
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:11,169
Scott: The guy's name was Grey.

77
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:15,250
Rym: Was he the target or did he target something?

78
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:16,827
Scott: I don't know.

79
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,149
Rym: Well, I don't remember anything about the plot of that movie.

80
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:21,067
Rym: Was there a movie or was there no AV?

81
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:27,190
Scott: I mean, I basically figure it had the same sort of plot as like an MD guys where it's sort of like bad guys in the tower.

82
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:28,028
Scott: Gotta go get them.

83
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:33,189
Scott: But you're the quiet, cool, bad ass, good guy.

84
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,709
Rym: Legend of the Gold of Babylon.

85
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,270
Rym: My news is that Discotek announced the 51 years of Lupin thing.

86
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,009
Scott: That sounds good.

87
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:50,490
Rym: Yeah, there was a penalty that apparently at Anime North, which apparently is a pretty good anime con, that they are releasing Legend of the Gold of Babylon.

88
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:50,989
Rym: Why?

89
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:51,965
Rym: On Blu-ray.

90
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:52,770
Rym: Why?

91
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,210
Rym: With a brand new English dub.

92
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:55,702
Scott: Why?

93
00:04:57,053 --> 00:04:57,889
Scott: The world wonders.

94
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,288
Scott: Who's going to pay for this?

95
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,810
Rym: Babylon Gold, Daryl Surratt.

96
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:03,490
Scott: Go look at Daryl Surratt's Twitter.

97
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:11,370
Scott: I mean, Discotek releases a lot of good anime in America, but who would pay actual American dollars for a copy of Babylon Gold?

98
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:27,150
Rym: Legend of the Gold of Babylon is so goddamn old and bad that the only releases I know of in English in America were the Rupon titles, because they had the problems with the Lupin name, and they released it on VHS and Laserdisc.

99
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,869
Rym: And we got a bootleg copy from the RIT Anime Club and we watched it.

100
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,310
Rym: It has a scene where Lupin is being chased by Zenigata.

101
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:42,330
Rym: They're both on motorcycles and they're flying around the face of a giant clown at what I assume is a carnival.

102
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:42,869
Scott: They're in Rio.

103
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,690
Rym: Oh, yeah, it is in Rio.

104
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:54,350
Rym: And it kind of pulls the Scooby-Doo reversal, where this is the Lupin where it actually was aliens.

105
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,589
Rym: There's no other plot.

106
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,547
Rym: There's no other like, "Oh, it was a secret plot with a

107
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:00,010
Rym: projector.".

108
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,130
Rym: No, it was literally just Goddess/Aliens and the Gold of Babylon.

109
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:07,050
Rym: It is dumb as shit.

110
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,290
Rym: The fact that this is being released on Blu-ray, it's kind of amazing.

111
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:16,389
Scott: I can say it's ridiculous, creative, and memorable, but not good.

112
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,629
Rym: Yeah, but ridiculous, creative, and memorable.

113
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,109
Scott: It's sort of like when you go to the museum and there's some freaky art and you're like, "Whoa," and you can't forget it, but you would never hang that in your house.

114
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:28,170
Rym: Ridiculous, creative, and memorable is how I would describe Apocalypse Zero.

115
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,189
Scott: And if the person who made that art was having like a exhibition of just their works, you wouldn't pay to go see it.

116
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:40,090
Rym: So I guess only watch this if you're curious about it and/or Apocalypse Zero, because you'll see something that is crazy and memorable.

117
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:44,449
Rym: Even though I don't remember anything about it other than the two things I said.

118
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,410
Rym: So yeah, this is happening.

119
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,188
Rym: You got any other news?

120
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,590
Scott: I got some tiny news.

121
00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:02,690
Scott: So number one, there's gonna be an anime movie screened in the US and G-Kids is hyping it up because it has the same producer as your name.

122
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,150
Scott: Oh, but it's not a Makoto Shinkai movie.

123
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:05,514
Scott: No.

124
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,788
Scott: No, but it's called Fireworks and they're putting it in the US on these three days very close to the 4th of July lol.

125
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:18,129
Scott: I assume the Japanese title of the movie is Hanabi because that's one of the few Japanese words I know.

126
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:21,327
Rym: I guess we should go see it.

127
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:28,430
Scott: We can go see it, but if you read the plot of this movie, it feels like Makoto Shinkai ripoff.

128
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:39,590
Scott: These some lovers keep going back in time on purpose to have like an intentional Groundhog Day so that they can get to a universe or timeline where they can stay together.

129
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:42,850
Rym: That does sound very Makoto Shinkai.

130
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,070
Scott: But it's not Makoto Shinkai.

131
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,668
Scott: As far as I can tell, he had nothing to do with it.

132
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:50,469
Scott: But the producer of your name though, you know, has something to do with it.

133
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:51,010
Rym: Yeah.

134
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:58,670
Scott: But yeah, if there's bad weather around the 4th of July weekend or whatever.

135
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,609
Rym: Well, the 4th of July, the actual holiday is on like a Wednesday this year.

136
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:03,709
Scott: So yeah, I mean there's three dates.

137
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,249
Scott: You can go to the website, you can buy tickets and go see this.

138
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,085
Rym: The 3rd, the 5th and the 7th, not the 4th.

139
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:08,927
Rym: There you go.

140
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,889
Rym: We'll probably go see it.

141
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:18,870
Rym: We'll do a show on it because, you know, the advice we always give if you like anime, watch pretty much every anime movie that isn't a numbered sequel to a property.

142
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:19,327
Rym: Yeah, why not?

143
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,989
Rym: Because worst case, well, I guess worst case you get Lupin the Legend of the Golden Babylon.

144
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:31,487
Scott: Anyway, so more and more news of the comic animation realm, right?

145
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,730
Scott: And they're both Netflix-y news, right?

146
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:41,690
Scott: One of them is Netflix is going to make, supposedly, I don't know if it's 100% confirmed yet, but people reported it.

147
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:44,744
Scott: There's a comic series called Locking Key.

148
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:45,590
Scott: that's real popular.

149
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,648
Scott: I've never read it.

150
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,610
Scott: I've never read it either.

151
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,549
Scott: I don't even know what it's about.

152
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:57,330
Scott: All I know is it's one of those things where it's like, you go to a comic book store and like, you know, there'll be quite a little bit of section of like locking key stuff and like it's popular.

153
00:08:57,431 --> 00:08:59,690
Scott: And I think there's even a board game based on it or something.

154
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:06,910
Scott: And like, it's one of those things where it's like, it's big, but only big in a small pond of comic people.

155
00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:18,110
Scott: But like the general population doesn't know, sort of like the way Game of Thrones was before it became a TV show, where it was big and like anyone who knew about fantasy novels and read them, like a huge Game of Thrones section.

156
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,430
Rym: I just read the plot summary.

157
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,390
Rym: It gets deep into a lot of proper nouns in a hurry.

158
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:34,149
Scott: But you know, like before Game of Thrones, the TV show, you'd go to the bookstore and all the nerds knew Game of Thrones, but other people didn't know what the fuck it was at all, right?

159
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:36,350
Scott: But it had a board game and it had a card.

160
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,569
Scott: It had all this stuff, right?

161
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:39,089
Scott: And then it became big.

162
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,830
Scott: Well, lock and key is now going to be an animation on Netflix.

163
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,549
Scott: So it's one of those things where all the nerds knew what it was.

164
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,928
Scott: And now it's going to be big.

165
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:48,230
Rym: I guess because we're geeks.

166
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,165
Rym: We didn't know anything about it.

167
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,308
Scott: Well, we knew it existed as the same as Game of Thrones existed.

168
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,066
Scott: I didn't.

169
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,109
Scott: I never bothered to read it.

170
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,646
Scott: And I didn't care.

171
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:59,550
Rym: I guess my rule always applies whenever anything like that is around.

172
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:02,150
Rym: If enough people talk about it, it makes enough splash.

173
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,268
Rym: I got to go see what the deal is.

174
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,889
Scott: Did you read Game of Thrones to see what the deal is?

175
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,344
Rym: Hell no.

176
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:07,310
Rym: Well, because I know that writing's bad.

177
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:08,969
Scott: You read Wheel of Time to see what the deal was.

178
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,323
Scott: Yeah.

179
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,870
Rym: And I read the whole thing because it was tolerable.

180
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,427
Rym: I tolerated it.

181
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,668
Scott: Were you going to read lock and key to see what the deal is?

182
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:23,929
Rym: Well, based on the four sentences of a very long summary of it that I read on Wikipedia, probably not.

183
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,810
Scott: Anyway, so the second one is also Netflix related, but quite the opposite.

184
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:34,030
Scott: Mark Millar and someone else, some comic people who make popular comic books.

185
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:42,530
Scott: Netflix is going to publish a comic book in the store on paper, but it's Netflix is the publisher.

186
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,307
Scott: So it's like you're going to go to the bookstore, the comic store, and it's going to say.

187
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:46,368
Scott: it's going to say Marvel.

188
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:47,547
Scott: It's going to say DC.

189
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:53,436
Scott: It's going to say image is going to see IDW and then it's going to say Netflix comic book, which is our move.

190
00:10:53,456 --> 00:11:03,250
Scott: that that see that all the news comic books for many years have been the R and D of stories for movies and television.

191
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:10,230
Rym: So Netflix is trying to cut even to make a vertical stack, at least genre movies and television books and comic books.

192
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:19,386
Scott: All the paper stuff has been, Oh, everyone, all the writers make stories over in those mediums and if they're any good, we'll make you a bunch of money by licensing you in these mediums.

193
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:19,626
Rym: Yeah.

194
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,349
Rym: So think of it this way.

195
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:25,350
Rym: If Netflix makes a bunch of comics, then the cost of making those comics is real low.

196
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:31,569
Rym: And if one of them makes it big enough and they decide to turn it into a show, they get to keep all that money.

197
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,387
Scott: They don't have to.

198
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:41,249
Rym: They don't have to buy a license from Marvel in DC because if they go out and look for popular comic books, the people who made those comic books know they're popular and they won't sell that license cheap.

199
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:43,830
Scott: Well, well, that point is had to pay a license period.

200
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:43,935
Scott: Yeah.

201
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:56,090
Scott: If Netflix decides later that this comic, the story in this comic is show worthy and it becomes popular, they had to pay zero dollars or almost no dollars, way less dollars.

202
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,009
Rym: Magic meets mob.

203
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,709
Scott: They'll also be paying some of those.

204
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:01,629
Scott: They'll probably have to pay the creators some money, but they won't.

205
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:04,910
Scott: The it's like they're going to license it from themselves.

206
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:05,270
Scott: Right.

207
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,510
Scott: It's, you know, that part of the money goes away.

208
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,049
Rym: It's a bunch of mob families who are also wizards.

209
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:11,923
Scott: Is that what it is?

210
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:12,870
Scott: Yeah.

211
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:14,628
Rym: Magic meets the mob.

212
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,309
Rym: My family is a magician sworn to protect our world.

213
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,849
Rym: Must battle an enemy who's picking them off one by one.

214
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,509
Scott: That's like, you know, someone who came up with that is basically like, what's popular with the people these days?

215
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:24,903
Scott: Yeah.

216
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:26,930
Scott: Crime stories and wizard stories.

217
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,869
Scott: Well, I know what we should be writing, dude.

218
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:34,001
Rym: If there was a comic that was just called crime wizards, I would read at least one issue of that.

219
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,170
Scott: Isn't that part of the, your forgotten realms?

220
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,068
Scott: Aren't there crime wizards?

221
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:40,529
Rym: No, there's more like fascist shithead wizards.

222
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,630
Rym: There aren't really wizards that are just crime into steel stuff.

223
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,609
Rym: They're all evil in like more intrinsic ways.

224
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:52,629
Rym: And one tiny thing, just a shortest possible geek bite because Emily and I finished made an abyss and you know what?

225
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,307
Rym: It's real good.

226
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:56,350
Rym: So we're going to probably do a real show on it in the near future.

227
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:58,549
Rym: When Scott also sees some of it.

228
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:16,930
Rym: So if you're looking for a show that has the aesthetic of a secret of mana kind of like JRPG action adventure RPG that has a secret of space where the plot and the characters drive a hundred percent as fast as possible into that secret to reveal it.

229
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,808
Rym: And that's the whole plot.

230
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:25,069
Rym: And you're willing to put up with ultra violence being perpetrated against a small children because that happens in this as well.

231
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,587
Rym: And it's a pretty good show.

232
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,850
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

233
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,327
Rym: What do you got?

234
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,967
Scott: Uh, so someone posted this on our forum, which is a place you should go if you want to see stuff like this.

235
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,470
Rym: Our Roku forum is pretty rocking.

236
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,870
Scott: Anyway, so what this is, is, you know, is a big ass boat and a big ass boat as a big ass anchor.

237
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:51,469
Scott: And they're letting the anchor out because they got to stop the boat, I guess, because it's what anchors do.

238
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,628
Scott: They keep the boat in one place.

239
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:57,069
Scott: Uh, so you know that the anchor is tied is, you know, they're letting it go.

240
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:04,289
Scott: It's got this big ass chain, a chain that could lock up like a cracking and the anchor is going down.

241
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:12,390
Scott: And basically the way you let the anchor go down is there's like a motor and it's got a break and you basically, you know, the break is holding.

242
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,010
Scott: It's from what I understand, it keeps the anchor from going down into the ocean.

243
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:18,730
Rym: Turbo in the forum explains this in a lot more detail, right?

244
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,890
Rym: I don't know shit about anchors.

245
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,390
Scott: You basically take your foot off the break to let the anchor go down.

246
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:25,069
Scott: Right.

247
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,730
Scott: And then, you know, you got to ease it off.

248
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,809
Scott: You can't just let the anchor go.

249
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,826
Scott: Whoosh, that's bad.

250
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,089
Scott: You got to, you got to let it go down slow.

251
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:36,268
Rym: Like the best part of those videos as he's closer to the end, the camera's like backing up a little bit.

252
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:41,310
Scott: So, uh, they, uh, they fuck it up and the anchor gets a little out of control.

253
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:52,410
Scott: And I guess it sucks for this boat, but it's great for us getting entertained by watching the enormous boat anchor go down to the bottom of the ocean way too quickly.

254
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:53,809
Rym: So the video is two minutes long.

255
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:03,570
Rym: And if you're really are impatient, you can skip to the second minute, but I'd recommend watching the whole thing because this escalates slowly until it's not escalating slowly anymore.

256
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,789
Scott: And even if you think, you know, keep watch to the end.

257
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:12,930
Scott: Cause even though, you know, well, at least watch till the anchor is gone because you think, oh, they got a handle on it.

258
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,157
Scott: No.

259
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:13,554
Scott: Yup.

260
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,768
Rym: There's a moment where you're like, okay, I think they got up.

261
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:17,308
Rym: Oh, that's a shame.

262
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,149
Scott: Keep going until there's no anchor left.

263
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,389
Rym: So my thing of the day, it's, it's, it's not really a cop out, but it is.

264
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,666
Rym: So it's an AMV.

265
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,410
Rym: Occasionally I showcase like a really good AMV or something, but I think AMVs are dead.

266
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:29,670
Scott: Yeah.

267
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:30,397
Rym: Yeah.

268
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:35,790
Rym: So I've, I've looked at the re I've looked at the winners of all the recent AMV competitions from like big cons.

269
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:36,398
Scott: Yeah.

270
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,850
Rym: They're still really like, they're common.

271
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,327
Rym: People make them still have AMV.

272
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:42,628
Rym: Yeah, they do.

273
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:43,850
Rym: And they're popular.

274
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,588
Rym: I don't know why.

275
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,830
Rym: Cause most of the AMVs are pretty bad real soon.

276
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,982
Scott: Right?

277
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,788
Scott: Like, yeah.

278
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:50,649
Rym: So, I mean, I made one AMV.

279
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,350
Rym: I think I made as good AMV as I would ever make.

280
00:15:53,490 --> 00:16:03,189
Rym: And I'm just never making one again, one and done, but this AMV is notable because I first saw this AMV in high school and you know how old I am.

281
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,890
Rym: This is back when one 20 P was a pretty good resolution.

282
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,289
Rym: Like you saw a video online at one 20 P you were living the high life.

283
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,570
Rym: So I saw, this is the first AMV I ever saw.

284
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,430
Rym: I saw an RM of it and it was amazing.

285
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,950
Scott: Cause I, this, I guess the first one I ever saw was the first one they showed at the first anime club.

286
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:28,669
Scott: Oh yeah.

287
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,189
Scott: Was it, I don't know.

288
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,549
Rym: I don't remember what those were.

289
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:38,609
Scott: They definitely showed, um, uh, the two mix music video there, but that wasn't technically not an AMV.

290
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,489
Rym: It's just an, it's an animated music video.

291
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:40,867
Scott: Yeah.

292
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,730
Scott: I forget what the other things they showed were.

293
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:43,579
Rym: Yeah.

294
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:52,430
Rym: I had already seen white reflection as well because I had an MP2 that I found and spent like a week downloading in high school.

295
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,190
Rym: But in the air tonight, the Sailor Moon AMV, there's actually, I found this video and it's a pretty interesting story.

296
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,610
Rym: So the, I have the original file that I downloaded still.

297
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,848
Rym: I have that RM file.

298
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,950
Rym: It is way bad quality.

299
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,048
Scott: Play them again.

300
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,353
Scott: Yeah.

301
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:16,869
Rym: So I was really proud of the fact that I had acquired this anime music video in high school.

302
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:28,210
Rym: This YouTube video that I'm linking to is my thing of the day, which was uploaded in 2012 is really high quality, like suspiciously high quality.

303
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:35,089
Rym: So the story is it was uploaded by the person who made this AMV.

304
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:35,989
Scott: Okay.

305
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:42,370
Rym: It was a very popular AMV because it was one of the early ones that was like available in a digital format.

306
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:48,668
Rym: And, uh, basically the reason they re uploaded it is I'm going to read this quote here.

307
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:56,189
Rym: This is probably one of the absolute worst in terms of release quality, uh, due to storage and bandwidth restrictions.

308
00:17:57,114 --> 00:17:58,650
Rym: It was the longest AMV I ever made.

309
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,868
Rym: It was hard to make blah, blah, blah.

310
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:18,707
Rym: Uh, thanks to my recent rediscovery of my master VHS tape, I can finally put this out here to resolution better than one 20 P. So they found the VHS that they use to master this AMV originally, and they scanned it in and uploaded it.

311
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:28,129
Rym: So ladies and gentlemen, the first AMV I ever saw in a, in a shockingly high quality compared to what I was impressed with in the nineties.

312
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:35,090
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights, good book club book is still the Odyssey by Homa translated by Emily Wilson.

313
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,089
Rym: Have you read any more of it?

314
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:39,490
Scott: Not much, but more than zero.

315
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,170
Rym: All right.

316
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,869
Rym: So you're past, uh, King Nestor.

317
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,770
Rym: You're at a actual Odysseus on his Odyssey.

318
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,769
Scott: Yeah, I've been, I've been on that for a little bit.

319
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,149
Rym: Have you run into polyphemus yet?

320
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,209
Rym: Do you remember who polyphemus is?

321
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:51,600
Scott: No.

322
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,283
Rym: Okay.

323
00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:00,269
Rym: You'll know when you run into polyphemus or polyphemus depending on where you went to school and read this in, uh, middle school or high school.

324
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,350
Rym: Uh, otherwise, uh, stay tuned.

325
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:09,350
Rym: If you want to see us at the penny arcade expo West, pretty good odds.

326
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:15,450
Rym: The badges are going to go on sale tomorrow, or if not tomorrow, next week.

327
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:16,008
Rym: Wow.

328
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:23,560
Scott: I will say this based on the history, basically you should be on like, wait, which Defcon is the worst?

329
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,370
Rym: lower is worse.

330
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,410
Rym: We're at Defcon one.

331
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,169
Scott: We're at Defcon one for packs badges.

332
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:30,890
Rym: Defcon one is the Defcon level of the nukes are already in flight.

333
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:31,488
Scott: That's right.

334
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,450
Rym: Like shit hit the fan.

335
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,087
Rym: It's over.

336
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,243
Scott: That's how on alert you should be for packs badges right now for all we know.

337
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:40,730
Scott: Yeah.

338
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,428
Rym: Cause I'm not looking at Twitter right now.

339
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:47,790
Rym: So if you want to see us at PAX West, good God, don't, you gotta be near a computer.

340
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:55,290
Rym: Like between the hours of 10 AM and 5 PM Eastern time, you gotta be on Twitter.

341
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,730
Rym: You're going to be subscribed to with notifications.

342
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,713
Scott: The two potential, uh, no, they're, they have an official Twitter account packs badges.

343
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:08,987
Scott: that will only, the only tweets that makes our tweets to announce badges are on sale or resale or reclaimed.

344
00:20:09,831 --> 00:20:18,609
Scott: And they'll also, if you need to test your badge notification system, they will at you a message on request and that those are the only tweets they make.

345
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,610
Scott: They're also very good about replying to those requests.

346
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,565
Scott: They will always do it.

347
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:27,845
Rym: Uh, if you want to see the PAX Unplugged, pretty sure that it just ain't even sold out yet.

348
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:30,219
Rym: You can just buy badges to it.

349
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:31,147
Rym: Yeah.

350
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,327
Rym: Check in to see right now.

351
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:32,635
Rym: Yep.

352
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:37,089
Rym: All days are available, including the kid's badge for Sunday, which I think is free.

353
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,243
Scott: I think it's 10 bucks.

354
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:39,709
Rym: I think it's like 10 bucks.

355
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:40,230
Rym: Yeah.

356
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:47,789
Rym: So yeah, if you had a little kid, you can, uh, go to PAX Unplugged in November on one day for like 10 bucks with the kid.

357
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:49,170
Scott: Well, the kid's 10 bucks.

358
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,810
Scott: You're not free.

359
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,364
Scott: You gotta pay.

360
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:54,759
Rym: Also, they do still sell a three day badge.

361
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,850
Rym: that is cheaper than individual day badges.

362
00:20:58,152 --> 00:20:58,597
Scott: That's good.

363
00:20:58,779 --> 00:20:59,669
Rym: because PAX Unplugged.

364
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,410
Scott: Do they have any, uh, merch you can preorder in advance?

365
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:03,705
Rym: They in fact do.

366
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:04,288
Scott: Yeah.

367
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,709
Scott: They're going to have that for West also.

368
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:06,307
Scott: Yeah.

369
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:09,270
Scott: So what is the merch you can order in advance?

370
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:14,710
Rym: Let's see a level up dice stand and dice socks and a blanket.

371
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,270
Rym: I got to see what this blanket looks like.

372
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:19,030
Rym: Oh, it's that bit.

373
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:20,350
Rym: I like that bit rod style.

374
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,729
Scott: All right, well you get that blanket then.

375
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,689
Rym: I just got to look at what kind of blanket it is.

376
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,570
Scott: A cheap mass manufactured blanket.

377
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,750
Rym: But is it a, I guess I'd rather have a beach towel than a blanket.

378
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:35,929
Rym: I would, I would pay, even if it was low quality, the beach towel I would bring to the beach.

379
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,274
Scott: Yeah.

380
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,270
Rym: It's a beach towel.

381
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,328
Rym: I don't care if it wears out.

382
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:43,790
Scott: And the best beach towel ever had was a free giveaway at Shea stadium.

383
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:46,469
Scott: It was the MetLife beach towel with Snoopy on it.

384
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:51,809
Scott: And in those days, nowadays you go get free stuff at a sporting event and it's always el cheapo, right?

385
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,964
Scott: Back in those days, they, I was the highest quality.

386
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,030
Scott: goddamn beach towel.

387
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,628
Scott: That shit lasted for so many years.

388
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,090
Scott: I was like, you go to the store and buy the most expensive beach towel.

389
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:01,767
Scott: That's what it was.

390
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:10,489
Rym: But when you're a nerd at a con or in public, you can wear the social currency that says, yo, I'm an, I'm a weeb and you can find other weebs that way.

391
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,529
Rym: Hard to do that at the beach because you ain't wearing much.

392
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:17,069
Rym: So a nerdy beach towel seems to be the only way to go.

393
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,070
Scott: Why don't we, I don't think anyone's selling nerdy beach umbrellas.

394
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:20,748
Scott: Maybe we should get on that.

395
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:21,849
Rym: Ooh, maybe we should.

396
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,989
Scott: A lot of, I've seen a lot of people at the beach when they want to wave their nerd flag, literally wave their nerd flag.

397
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,250
Scott: They'll set up next to their beach tent, you know, or canopy, a flagpole.

398
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:33,790
Scott: Right.

399
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:40,990
Scott: And usually it's old people setting up like American flags or whatever, but, or POW flags and stuff on the beach.

400
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:44,570
Scott: But I've seen people wave like star Wars, rebel flags on the beach.

401
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,888
Scott: So go nuts.

402
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:46,413
Scott: Yeah.

403
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:51,070
Rym: Uh, otherwise the other thing, uh, you might remember team flags also popular.

404
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,549
Scott: Get your East favorite East sports teams flag up there.

405
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,186
Rym: Oh yeah.

406
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,429
Rym: The New York whatevers.

407
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,030
Rym: Cause I don't care, but we also did resume.

408
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:01,929
Rym: This is Wednesday.

409
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:02,989
Rym: You probably care about this.

410
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:06,789
Rym: If you were waiting for us to do that Utena show again, GeekNights presents Utena.

411
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,850
Rym: We actually did a new episode.

412
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,490
Rym: It is uploaded and I have solved probably permanently the copyright problem.

413
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,530
Rym: This video is in the clear.

414
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,769
Rym: It's even monetized.

415
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,210
Scott: So you collected money off a tenant.

416
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:20,623
Rym: Yeah.

417
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:26,270
Rym: I've made like 12 cents off of you lovely people watching this video so far.

418
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:35,169
Rym: So yeah, if you, uh, liked revolutionary girl Utena and you wondered what the hell it was about, cause you couldn't figure it out on your own.

419
00:23:35,712 --> 00:23:38,330
Rym: Well, you're in luck cause we have talked about in detail.

420
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:43,010
Rym: The first 16 episodes, uh, we're like halfway, a little under halfway.

421
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:43,427
Scott: Almost.

422
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,369
Rym: Even though I feel like after we do 39, we're going to have to do a few like, let's go back.

423
00:23:49,635 --> 00:23:50,950
Rym: Do we really need to do the movie?

424
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:54,590
Rym: Uh, no, we're not doing the manga.

425
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,690
Rym: I'm not a fan of the Utena manga actually.

426
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:07,430
Rym: In fact, I'm less a fan of the longer, the further, the longer I've gone on thinking about Utena, the less I like Chiyo Saito's manga of Utena new manga volume coming.

427
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:08,068
Rym: I know.

428
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,010
Rym: I'm not that excited about it, to be honest.

429
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,429
Rym: I'm just shocked that it's happening.

430
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,670
Scott: The, uh, stage plays.

431
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,270
Rym: Those I feel like I could get into actually.

432
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:16,799
Scott: I know.

433
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,610
Scott: I watched a clip of one recently is bad.

434
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,708
Rym: I watched a clip of the old, old ones.

435
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,058
Rym: So what's a Koi?

436
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,950
Rym: love is hard for the Otaku.

437
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,280
Scott: So we, we, we prejudge this on.

438
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,867
Scott: judge anime by its cover, which we're going to do again in a few weeks.

439
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,870
Rym: Oh yeah, that's right.

440
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,976
Rym: Judge anime by its covers.

441
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:34,250
Rym: another anime related YouTube series we're doing.

442
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:42,830
Scott: And basically what we said is, Hey, this looks like, you know, some cute obviously romance, uh, you know, but it's about otaku.

443
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:50,929
Scott: So I thought it was going to be one of those shows, you know, where otaku's can sort of, you know, fantasize about getting some romance in the office action.

444
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,302
Rym: Yup.

445
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,787
Rym: But it didn't have any of the like major rewarding sign flags of.

446
00:24:55,888 --> 00:25:01,230
Rym: it's going to be skeevy or it's going to be creepy or it's going to be too much wish fulfillment.

447
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:01,830
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:10,010
Scott: I thought it was going to be somewhere in between, you know, like, uh, uh, my love story, but yeah, that's what I was thinking.

449
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,829
Scott: Something like that.

450
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:11,149
Scott: Right.

451
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:15,788
Rym: Uh, but anyway, so it reminds me of my love story a lot in terms of its pacing, sort of.

452
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:21,090
Scott: Uh, but anyway, I watched what, seven episodes of this thing, by the way, it's streaming only on Amazon.

453
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,169
Scott: If you have Amazon prime, you can just watch it for free.

454
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:25,529
Scott: If you don't, I don't know where you watch it.

455
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,370
Rym: I watched, uh, three episodes.

456
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,610
Rym: I watched one of my computer and two of my phone because the Amazon thing just works.

457
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:31,548
Scott: So here's the deal.

458
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:34,050
Scott: This girl, uh, who's an otaku.

459
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,670
Scott: She is a bl making comic cat otaku.

460
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,909
Rym: She is a horrifying for Joshi.

461
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,390
Scott: Yes.

462
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:47,468
Scott: She has a new job because she, I guess she left her old job because they found out she was an otaku and she couldn't take it.

463
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:50,130
Scott: And I guess her boyfriend dumped her cause she was no time.

464
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:56,930
Rym: Her boyfriend dumped her because she was a for Joshi and he didn't want to be seen with her and immediately started dating some other girl who wasn't nerdy.

465
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,950
Scott: So she left that job and got a new job.

466
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,408
Scott: So, uh, she came to this new job and she doesn't want anyone to know that she's no otaku.

467
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:09,410
Scott: And then I can, the first day she bumps into someone who is the childhood friend.

468
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:10,186
Scott: Oh my God.

469
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:11,306
Scott: It's a trope.

470
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,209
Scott: The childhood friend trope in the anime.

471
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,579
Rym: Yup.

472
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:14,628
Rym: And he's no talk.

473
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,566
Rym: And he doesn't even hide it.

474
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:15,990
Scott: Nope.

475
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:20,546
Scott: And the first thing he does, like in the hallway is ask her like, Hey, you going to the next comic cat?

476
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:29,190
Scott: And she's like, Oh shit, no, no, but then it turns out, uh, by luck and this all happens in the first episode.

477
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:29,508
Rym: Yeah.

478
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:35,010
Scott: That, uh, her female coworker is also no otaku, a cosplay one.

479
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:40,030
Rym: That bit I actually liked a lot cause it's this like they have this generic office interaction.

480
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,070
Rym: Like you're like, like you do, you've all worked in offices.

481
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:52,085
Rym: Many of you, I guess a lot of you are in high school, so, but it'll be a point where you're working in an office and someone will reveal a nerdy shibboleth like.

482
00:26:52,186 --> 00:27:02,556
Rym: they will say a word or use a phrase or have a desktop background where you're not sure they're a nerd, but there's a chance.

483
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,170
Rym: like they've got a link key chain.

484
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,407
Rym: You're like, Whoa, do they, do they like, do they just know about link?

485
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,950
Rym: or if they played like every Zelda game?

486
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:10,885
Rym: Like, I don't know.

487
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,345
Scott: I'm pretty sure they played at least one Zelda game key jade.

488
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:15,849
Scott: It's just the question of how old they are.

489
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,220
Rym: Yeah.

490
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:19,290
Rym: But it's also a question of, are they casually into this?

491
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,368
Rym: Are they a nerd like me?

492
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:22,890
Rym: Can I immediately start going crazy on them?

493
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:24,028
Scott: You make it your key chain.

494
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,348
Scott: You can go crazy.

495
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:25,969
Rym: I don't know.

496
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,167
Rym: My son gave this to me.

497
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,629
Rym: I don't know.

498
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,690
Rym: My girlfriend gave this.

499
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,649
Scott: No one's got a key chain because someone gave it to, uh, I've seen people who have nerdy key chains.

500
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,627
Rym: They have no idea what they are.

501
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:50,209
Scott: I've literally said that happened before at work, but she doesn't want to, we should give out nerdy key chains to people for free, but they're actually from like some hentai, but you wouldn't know looking at it.

502
00:27:51,132 --> 00:27:52,890
Scott: These people all have overfeed and key chains.

503
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,708
Scott: They don't realize it.

504
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,330
Scott: So, and then people who do realize they're like, oh, funny stories there.

505
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:10,689
Rym: Emily had an interaction with a girl and her mother at a, at a convention where she was staffing and the mother was being a pain in the ass, but the girl was definitely cosplaying as something from a straight up porn.

506
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:19,609
Rym: And the mom clearly had no idea what this costume was, but the other one that's more funny is I wear my ogloff shirt, which is just as cute fox.

507
00:28:20,674 --> 00:28:22,810
Rym: If you don't know, you just see this shirt.

508
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,109
Rym: It's like, oh, that's a cute fox shirt.

509
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,309
Rym: And some people are like, oh, that's a cute fox shirt.

510
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:34,968
Rym: And some people at conventions will say, I recognize that shirt and that's all they need to say.

511
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,649
Rym: Cause now I know they know that I know and I know that they know.

512
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:40,888
Rym: And usually all I say is, yup.

513
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,289
Rym: Glad you noticed.

514
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:44,367
Rym: I'm glad you know what this is.

515
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:46,210
Scott: That's right.

516
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,623
Scott: Anyway, so the back to the, so.

517
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:52,628
Rym: But she wants to like figure out how nerdy her boss is without her boss.

518
00:28:53,450 --> 00:29:12,730
Scott: But basically what ends up happening, I know, you know, long story short is this four coworkers, her, the childhood friend, who's the gamer nerd, the other coworker who is the cosplay nerd and the other coworkers, the two dudes and two girls, the other coworker who is a nerd who hides it, but he likes things like Evangelion figurines.

519
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:17,910
Rym: And so you've got like the four kinds of nerdy coworkers in an office, right?

520
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:23,210
Scott: So basically she dates the childhood friend and the other two coworkers are dating.

521
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,858
Rym: And it's not a will they won't they.

522
00:29:24,918 --> 00:29:26,410
Rym: they're dating by the end of the first episode.

523
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:26,710
Scott: Yeah.

524
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:27,670
Scott: That it's the new style.

525
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,165
Scott: The old style is always will.

526
00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:29,670
Scott: they won't they.

527
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,030
Scott: The new style is dating right away.

528
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:33,630
Scott: And now we'll show you what the relationships.

529
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:33,970
Rym: Yeah.

530
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:35,610
Rym: My love story did that and it was great.

531
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,230
Rym: This show's doing it similar.

532
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,522
Scott: That's the new way romance animes go.

533
00:29:39,582 --> 00:29:40,710
Scott: is everyone's dating right away.

534
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,145
Rym: Cause you can't Miyakatama home it like.

535
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:43,910
Rym: I'm done with that.

536
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,150
Rym: No, that was done with that before I finished watching.

537
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:47,730
Scott: That's played out anyway.

538
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,240
Scott: So basically each, it's very episodic.

539
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,848
Scott: from then on, there's a little bit of continuity going on, but not much.

540
00:29:55,351 --> 00:30:02,610
Scott: And what the, basically each episode is like, Ooh, there's some sort of trouble or some sort of, you know, relationship drama.

541
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,530
Rym: They both suck at being in relationships and it's really sad actually.

542
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:07,030
Scott: Right.

543
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:08,330
Scott: And then it sort of resolves.

544
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:10,269
Scott: And then the next episode there's another thing.

545
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:19,850
Rym: Like they don't know how to, it's interesting watching characters that are written well to act like people who are bad at basic parts of life, but good at some other part.

546
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,730
Rym: Like it's pretty well written in that regard is that it was what I would say.

547
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,130
Rym: Cause I don't want to spoil what happens in like later episodes.

548
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,570
Rym: Everything I spoiled is like episode one.

549
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:34,590
Scott: Like episode two is basically like, Oh, the problem is they, they were such close friends, but then once they made it official, they were dating.

550
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:36,428
Scott: They had a hard time talking to each other.

551
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:36,936
Scott: Right.

552
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,008
Scott: Resolve that.

553
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,150
Scott: That's episode two, right?

554
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:44,090
Scott: Episode, I think I forget which episodes are, but one of the episodes is like, Oh, it's Christmas.

555
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,250
Scott: What are they going to do for Christmas together?

556
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,310
Scott: They're all awkward.

557
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,767
Scott: What are they going to, what's going to happen?

558
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:54,183
Scott: And the thing is, is like the actual sort of conflicts.

559
00:30:54,424 --> 00:31:12,210
Scott: problems aren't really that interesting, but each episode manages to have like at least one or two moments that are kind of funny and unique and hilarious, especially if you're like, if you can relate to this, it's like, or if you're an otaku, who's trying to date.

560
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:12,765
Scott: Yeah.

561
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:13,930
Scott: Right.

562
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,570
Rym: But I love the underwhelming theme of someone's like, Oh, I'm such an otaku.

563
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,470
Rym: I can't let anyone know where no one will date me.

564
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:24,029
Scott: This actually teaches like even like lessons that are true.

565
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,110
Scott: It's like, it's like, Oh, it's so true.

566
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,729
Scott: Oh my God.

567
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:27,082
Scott: Lols.

568
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,249
Rym: But she's like, Oh no, if anyone finds out I'm an otaku, they won't date me.

569
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:32,890
Rym: And then the dude's like, why don't you just date an otaku?

570
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:43,149
Rym: She's like, I don't want to date a fucking otaku, which is, that's kind of how that guys and otaku and that's how they all seem to act.

571
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:43,544
Scott: Yep.

572
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:50,090
Scott: You know, and it shows, you know, a lot of things like, Oh, you know, if you would have dated not otaku guy, it would have been bad.

573
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:56,230
Scott: You know, see, it's like if you date not otaku guy, then he doesn't respect any of your otaku stuff, even if he still goes out with you.

574
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,649
Scott: But look, now you're dating otaku guy.

575
00:31:57,992 --> 00:32:00,430
Scott: He comes and works at your table at Kamikaze.

576
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:00,755
Scott: Yeah.

577
00:32:01,572 --> 00:32:13,369
Scott: And then it's like, Oh, all that she hears, uh, she's walking around Kamikaze after buying something and she hears like girls whispering, Oh my God, there was a cute cosplaying boy selling stuff at this table selling yaoi.

578
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,870
Scott: It's like, Oh my God, I had to get back to my table.

579
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:18,969
Scott: So it's like that.

580
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,530
Scott: That's the kind of funny moments that you get that are like the good part of this show.

581
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:33,876
Rym: It's very relatable to like adult nerds in America as well, because a lot of our friends, like a lot of people, it's not super Japanese, actually their workplace, even though it's 100% Japan seems very American.

582
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,769
Scott: They work on time.

583
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,990
Scott: They leave our con time.

584
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:38,909
Scott: They're not overworked.

585
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:44,642
Scott: You know, they're chilling at lunch and you know, the, the work they're doing is kind of not, it's not office.

586
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:46,590
Scott: No, it's not.

587
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:47,129
Scott: Not at all.

588
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,848
Scott: Not in any way.

589
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:49,034
Scott: You don't even know.

590
00:32:49,075 --> 00:33:00,110
Scott: the things I don't like about the show is that there's really only five characters and really only one of them is a minor character that you don't even see from any episodes, which is the main guy's brother.

591
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,481
Scott: Like I feel like this show would be better if it had a little more of a cast of idiots.

592
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,129
Scott: This basically only has four people in the whole show.

593
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:20,149
Scott: And it's literally just every scenario, at least in seven episodes, the same four characters with the brought that one brother thrown in a little bit in the late in the, some of the later episodes.

594
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:23,630
Scott: And it's like, how much can I get out of these four characters?

595
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,290
Scott: You're really milking every milk you can get out of this.

596
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:26,550
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,889
Rym: You got to pull the Simpsons and bring in the most is like and give him like a whole episode.

598
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,059
Rym: Yeah.

599
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,610
Scott: I mean, I don't, you don't see anyone else in the office.

600
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,010
Scott: You don't see anyone else in the town, you know, as like every single time all four characters end up getting together.

601
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:40,530
Scott: It's never two of them alone here or two of them alone there.

602
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:46,230
Scott: And it seems like you get this feeling that they do have entire lives in between the episodes.

603
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:53,150
Scott: And really what's happening is that any the rest of their lives were not all four of them are together are happening.

604
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,050
Scott: There's like, in fact, it feels like most of their lives, not all four of them are together.

605
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:02,889
Scott: That wouldn't make sense, but it's like the camera turns on when all four of them get together and then episode begins.

606
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:08,469
Scott: And then when they all split up and go back to their lives again, the camera turns off and that's in between episodes.

607
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,507
Rym: Yeah, I could see that.

608
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:16,770
Scott: It's like they're probably been like a weeks, like two weeks since the last episode, you know, but they just weren't all getting together after work.

609
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:21,347
Scott: And then suddenly an episode starts and it's like, hey, are we all going to the bar after work?

610
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:21,674
Scott: Yeah.

611
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,469
Scott: You know, they go to book off after work in one episode.

612
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,809
Scott: The drama of going to book off.

613
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,489
Scott: Oh, I don't want to buy with cheese.

614
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,969
Scott: I don't want to walk around and follow her and go to the section.

615
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,489
Scott: She's going to, you know, I don't like going to the store alone.

616
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,750
Scott: I don't want to go with anybody.

617
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:38,250
Scott: I do want to go with someone.

618
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:38,869
Scott: That was my dream.

619
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,389
Scott: Do you bring go to book off with a friend?

620
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:46,649
Rym: I'm again, it's an anime that will appeal to people who are in their late twenties to thirties and are kind of nerdy.

621
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:51,789
Rym: And I mean, like granted in my work, everyone knows like, oh yeah, he's the fucking nerd guy who knows all the nerd shit.

622
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,009
Scott: But I know a lot of you out there.

623
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,810
Scott: People on the nerd right away.

624
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,589
Scott: I'm like nerd coming through.

625
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,181
Scott: Yep.

626
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,310
Scott: You want to hire this nerd swerve for the podcast?

627
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:04,109
Scott: You do.

628
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:04,768
Scott: Are you sure?

629
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:05,221
Rym: Yep.

630
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,309
Rym: I got, I got my new job.

631
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,490
Rym: My resume GeekNights was literally at the top.

632
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,130
Rym: It was like, I do this podcast.

633
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,529
Scott: I'm going to this packs thing.

634
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,729
Scott: And if you try to tell me no, I'm going to quit.

635
00:35:16,054 --> 00:35:16,263
Rym: Yep.

636
00:35:17,773 --> 00:35:18,667
Scott: Just letting you know now.

637
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:19,326
Rym: Yep.

638
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,429
Scott: Not joking.

639
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:22,890
Rym: My condition of employment.

640
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,849
Scott: Once I said I wouldn't, I did.

641
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:25,266
Scott: Yup.

642
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,129
Scott: I don't think I quit a job.

643
00:35:28,518 --> 00:35:28,708
Scott: Jobs.

644
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:30,069
Rym: I too skipped that.

645
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,229
Scott: Want to go to that wedding more than I want to go to this job.

646
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:35,550
Rym: But I want to go to packs more than I want to do most things.

647
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,083
Rym: That's right.

648
00:35:37,614 --> 00:35:39,869
Scott: So pay attention to buy tickets this week or next.

649
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:41,229
Rym: But I like this show.

650
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:43,090
Rym: I'll probably watch all of it.

651
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,610
Scott: It's not, I don't know if I'll watch it.

652
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,569
Scott: I don't think it's like, I'm not going to go.

653
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:49,809
Scott: And like every time a new episode comes out, watch it.

654
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,270
Scott: But when I'm bored, someone else is like, Hey, I want to watch more of that show.

655
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:53,887
Scott: But like I.

656
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:54,242
Rym: Yep.

657
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,470
Rym: Or if I'm bored and like I'm commuting, I'll just watch like an episode.

658
00:35:58,953 --> 00:35:59,969
Scott: Also, it has boob jokes.

659
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:03,670
Scott: So, but they're, they're less boob jokes than dragon maid.

660
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,710
Scott: So it's, it's a tolerable level of boob.

661
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:06,390
Rym: Dragon maid.

662
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,090
Rym: They were above the, like they were getting above the line of eh.

663
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:15,588
Scott: This is below the line of boob joke cannot be tolerated, but they're there in case, you know, that's the thing for you.

664
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:16,083
Rym: Yep.

665
00:36:16,371 --> 00:36:20,410
Rym: It's also an anime that is pretty, just sort of fun and benign to watch.

666
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,869
Rym: Like it's not one of those shows you get to warn people about it.

667
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:24,290
Rym: No, like maiden abyss.

668
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,430
Scott: I like it is one of those shows where you don't know anything about nerdiness.

669
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,350
Scott: Like if you don't know what the hell BL and yaoi is, it won't make any sense.

670
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,150
Scott: It won't make any sense.

671
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,689
Scott: Cause like there's a whole scene in a diner where they're arguing over who should be on top and who should be on the bottom.

672
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:49,586
Scott: But then I appreciate both that argument and the fact that the show at first, they're arguing about like these two fictional anime, you know, they're arguing about characters in manga and then they're arguing about their boyfriends, which one should be on top and bottom.

673
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:56,810
Rym: But like a lot of shows that do deal with this kind of subject matter tend to go the route of explaining everything.

674
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,350
Rym: Like there's definitely a show.

675
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:04,569
Scott: If you don't know what comic kit is and what doujinshi are and what cosplaying is, you won't understand what the fuck is going on.

676
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:04,927
Scott: Yeah.

677
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:08,050
Scott: Also, all of the video games in this are Nintendo.

678
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:12,550
Scott: It's like obviously monster hunter on the switch, obviously Mario Kart, obviously.

679
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:12,907
Scott: Right.

680
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:14,287
Scott: It's all Nintendo games.

681
00:37:14,813 --> 00:37:16,409
Rym: Because they're playing their switches all the time.

682
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,250
Scott: There's one episode where they play an MMO together.

683
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,090
Rym: I love you early on when the dude, I think it's actually only half an episode.

684
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,628
Scott: And then the other half episode is something else.

685
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,730
Rym: The like the more crypto nerdy guy comes over to the dude and he's like, hey, something, something, something.

686
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,009
Rym: The guy's like, do you mind?

687
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,550
Rym: He's like, why are you playing video games?

688
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:33,948
Rym: It's work.

689
00:37:34,273 --> 00:37:35,829
Rym: And all he does is hold up his watch.

690
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:37,110
Rym: It's 1201.

691
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,830
Rym: It's 1201.

692
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,690
Rym: And it's lunchtime.

693
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,108
Scott: That's me.

694
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:39,969
Rym: Do you mind?

695
00:37:40,652 --> 00:37:40,910
Scott: It's me.

696
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,049
Scott: Not working.

697
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,150
Rym: As he eats garbage.

698
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:44,367
Scott: I'm leaving.

699
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:44,776
Scott: Bye.

700
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,043
Scott: See ya.

701
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,828
Rym: So, yeah, but I like the fact that the show.

702
00:37:51,010 --> 00:38:00,490
Rym: Assumes the audience knows the subject matter and skips past all that and gets right into like, they're arguing about the drop rate of the Ruby in the game.

703
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,830
Scott: This is a, it's a cute show for nerds only.

704
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:05,430
Scott: It's inoffensive.

705
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:09,730
Scott: It has fun moments, but it's not like some kind of a plus anime.

706
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:12,890
Scott: I'm again, it's just, Hey, it's cool that this exists.

707
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:14,010
Scott: Have a good time.

708
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,010
Scott: If you've got nothing else going on.

709
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,470
Rym: It's anime I like, I'll watch it casually.

710
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,310
Rym: I'm not going to shotgun all the episodes like I did with Made in This.

711
00:38:25,144 --> 00:38:27,280
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
