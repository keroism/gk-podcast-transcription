1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,587
Rym: It's Thursday, March 29th, 2018.

2
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:25,745
Rym: I'm Rym Scott and tonight on GeekNights We are talking about socks for your feet Not socks proxies Let's do.

3
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:30,585
Rym: this is a joke about a socks proxy actually An obvious joke.

4
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:36,671
Rym: I was I was also thinking it but I feel like the average listener Is too young to have ever encountered that.

5
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,739
Scott: I was also thinking it like war.

6
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,334
Rym: yeah, but we're the same age and we come from the same.

7
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:44,090
Rym: like generation of computer.

8
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:49,954
Rym: like Sox isn't really used anymore except in like archaic enterprise nonsense.

9
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:50,917
Scott: Just saying that.

10
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:51,980
Scott: I was also thinking this.

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:01:03,741
Rym: Yep In fact, one of my first jobs was maintaining a socks proxy that ran on os2 warp To connect this SNA network with the internal Ethernet network in a print in an IBM Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,259
Rym: That was a Shall we say ancient times?

13
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,192
Rym: So, uh, yeah, it's a Thursday GeekNights.

14
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:11,855
Rym: It's the lounge.

15
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:12,780
Rym: we can talk about anything.

16
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:14,584
Rym: It's not the lounge.

17
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:15,729
Rym: You can't talk about anything.

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,135
Scott: No, that's it going home.

19
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:21,669
Rym: Yeah But uh, yeah packs is coming up real soon.

20
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:24,220
Scott: we're doing kind of a weird skip into the minute moment right now.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,763
Scott: I'm saying we're.

22
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:30,549
Rym: it means we're doing sort of like a weird abbreviated schedule and I'm sort of Preoccupied with the fact that packs has come in.

23
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,556
Rym: I'm pretty hyped for it like more.

24
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:33,540
Scott: so I knew furniture.

25
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:36,139
Rym: Oh, yeah, you just then.

26
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:39,112
Rym: It's interesting to be in the position.

27
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,380
Scott: We're having rid of a bunch of crap.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,467
Scott: My apartment is taking up too much room that would need.

29
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:43,551
Scott: the furniture needs to go.

30
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:47,163
Rym: We're old enough to where you Telling us.

31
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:50,820
Rym: Oh, I'm buying furniture and like the details are like who are you getting a chase?

32
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,960
Rym: Like what are you gonna put what kind of furniture you get?

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,111
Rym: And that was a real exciting conversation for us when I moved into the apartment.

34
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:05,018
Scott: I just got IKEA furniture as fast as possible And that was the cheapest and the most convenient without planning or designing or anything.

35
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,489
Scott: and now it's like, okay The couch is broken.

36
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,160
Scott: I need new furniture.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,995
Scott: Now I can actually think about this and get the best furniture.

38
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:14,380
Rym: furniture ain't cheap?

39
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:19,680
Scott: No, not good furniture unless you want the worst furniture or you know.

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,794
Scott: I mean IKEA is slightly less cheap, you know, it's still way cheap compared to real furniture.

41
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:27,060
Scott: Yeah, but it doesn't last that long.

42
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:32,159
Rym: And the problem is it's very easy to find furniture that I like.

43
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,009
Rym: That looks good.

44
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,095
Rym: That would be 100% perfect.

45
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:41,553
Rym: Usually the things that are perfect are it's not even like oh, it's a few thousand dollars.

46
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:44,301
Rym: It's like yeah, that's eight thousand dollars fucker Yep.

47
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:49,906
Scott: Well also, you know the other problem is like if I had a big old empty house It'd be really easy to get furniture.

48
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,340
Scott: But when you have a tiny ass apartment suddenly, everything is difficult.

49
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:57,620
Rym: Yep, like giant like when I was a kid, we had a giant living room and a giant family room.

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,395
Scott: So they go to the furniture store and you see this big layout.

51
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:03,360
Scott: You're like, oh, this is perfect And it's like take that whole place to be late.

52
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,336
Scott: This would be terrific if I had an enormous room that was bigger than my apartment.

53
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,400
Scott: five times five.

54
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:18,492
Rym: Yeah the Midwestern like Large house you have the giant lazy boys somewhere and then he got like the big sectional couch That takes up like it would fill this entire room.

55
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,780
Scott: I don't think you could fit it in this room.

56
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:23,457
Rym: You could probably cut it up and fit all the pieces in this room.

57
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,189
Scott: sure It would be just a big.

58
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,560
Scott: the room would just be one big cushion.

59
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,848
Rym: So maybe that's my strategy just cushion the floors.

60
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,774
Rym: Okay, so you got any news?

61
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:33,560
Scott: I do have a news.

62
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,868
Scott: So, I don't know if this is really news.

63
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:36,880
Scott: It was almost thing of the day, but whatever.

64
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:43,320
Scott: So they someone wrote and investigated and got this article about the history of nesticle.

65
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:46,275
Scott: And if you don't know back in the day like late 90s, right?

66
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,007
Scott: I'll never get over that icon.

67
00:03:49,167 --> 00:04:08,325
Scott: when I first discovered what an emulator was and realized I could play Console games on my computer and download them for free and not have to pay money and get cartridges And just use my gravis gamepad and not you know, the real controllers Which you can now use the real controllers things to USB which didn't really exist too much then eggs only uses it then a little bit.

68
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:13,608
Scott: but yeah Someone went and researched the history of nesticle.

69
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:19,117
Scott: who made it where it came from when they made it how they made it all the Drama that happened in the scene around it.

70
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:23,619
Scott: You know where the why there was a pair of testicles as the icon.

71
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,629
Scott: All this grand nesticle was.

72
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:39,329
Rym: it's interesting because not only was it like the first Widespread use emulator that like nerds would find and use who weren't like deep into the scene It was really like fully featured.

73
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:49,277
Scott: No, it was in this emulator basically invented all those features They talk about like what happened is nesticle what you know, what happened to the guy I ended up using SNES 9x for SNES?

74
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:52,679
Scott: You read this article you'll know I just saw.

75
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:57,117
Scott: You'll find out why you ended up using SNES 9x.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,208
Scott: Oh, yes, and yes and ZSNES that came later.

77
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:05,923
Scott: And yeah, I didn't realize that Genesis was made by the same guy who made nesticle Stuff like that.

78
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:10,380
Scott: So this is like it's like weird to read an article about history that I lived.

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:19,277
Rym: Yeah, right like it'd be like if there was an article that described the inner workings of the magic the gathering scene during the revised era.

80
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:22,560
Scott: It's yeah, it's like what this is.

81
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:30,205
Scott: So yeah If you know if you're just somebody takes emulators for granted or someone who also lived through this And doesn't you know?

82
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:35,528
Scott: because I lived through this but I didn't know all these details about what was going on Wasn't in the scene.

83
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:37,640
Scott: I was just some kid who was downloading rums.

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:48,139
Rym: Yeah, a friend of mine on a BBS was like yo You can play any yes games on a computer and I was like you're lying Mm-hmm, and then they were like no no no check this out.

85
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,689
Rym: And then I installed nesticle and it was it.

86
00:05:51,970 --> 00:06:03,500
Rym: it was like that moment when I first heard an mp3 And I realized what that meant for the future the first time I started Mario 1 in an emulator.

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,220
Rym: I just paused it and sat there thinking wow, this changes everything.

88
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,628
Rym: and Most of the NES games I played on the emulator were games I already owned cartridges for.

89
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:19,765
Rym: it was just way more convenient to play on the computer Also saves eights men.

90
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:27,734
Rym: I beat a lot of games that I never bet beat on a real console Like Wizards and Warriors games Wizards warriors fucking three.

91
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:31,393
Scott: There was no way I was gonna beat that game I like with no warriors to all the elemental bosses.

92
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:33,124
Rym: Oh, yeah - it's pretty good I like -.

93
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,657
Scott: I had a strategy guide for that.

94
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:42,236
Scott: I was one of those times where you're a kid you buy a strategy guide and all the strategies for games You don't have yep, which just made me want to buy those games.

95
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:43,119
Scott: It was in there.

96
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:53,464
Rym: but actually I was thinking I was watching the world records for Wizards warriors 1 and I remember I played that again recently on an emulator and Hard as balls.

97
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:55,130
Rym: Yeah, but it's also pretty fun.

98
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,403
Rym: Like I feel like I could beat Wizards and Warriors 1.

99
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:00,329
Scott: I like the aesthetic of it Wizards and Warriors.

100
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:03,740
Scott: Well the spiders and the treasure chests and the candidates and the wizards.

101
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:11,760
Rym: Yeah I'd like I'd like to see a remake of that kind of game Sure, like Shovel Knight style like take it and make it a little bit more accessible and less bullshit.

102
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:23,486
Rym: But no I mean I have not read this article and I'm going to read it because I'm really curious about all these details that were Completely opaque to me as a child.

103
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:28,824
Scott: I mean, I think the main takeaway from this right is like, you know There's all this scene drama.

104
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:31,935
Scott: and we you know, even today this every scene has drama.

105
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:41,020
Rym: right now, you know any fandom whatever Going crazy right now about some like YouTube shouty man that I'd no idea right kind of in that scene.

106
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,780
Scott: But in the long run, it's the all that scene drama doesn't matter and goes away.

107
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:48,419
Scott: No one cares everyone just laughs about it if they even remember it.

108
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,726
Rym: Well, I guess it turns into like.

109
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:54,351
Scott: and this is you know, you can see the things that last you know That really matter is goddamn.

110
00:07:54,372 --> 00:08:06,179
Rym: we can all play any of this game yep, and but I guess like which emulator became the one of choice is probably driven by drama that No longer is remembered only the result remains.

111
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:11,619
Rym: So in some other news, this is actually Really relevant to the fact that we're going to PAX.

112
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,853
Rym: So, you know, you can crack your knuckles make some noise.

113
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:17,587
Rym: Some people can some people can yep Some people can some people can.

114
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,459
Rym: did you know that to this day?

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,050
Rym: No one Actually knows what makes that sounds.

116
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:24,874
Scott: what do you mean?

117
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:26,160
Scott: It's like your knuckles, right?

118
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:32,539
Rym: Okay, explain it to me what when I crack my knuckle what causes that sound specific?

119
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Scott: Well, I've seen this article so I know the real answer.

120
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,828
Scott: But this is the answer that a common person would say.

121
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,854
Scott: so I'm gonna pretend to be naive, right?

122
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:41,780
Scott: Yeah, so you got bones.

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,990
Scott: Yeah, you got muscles holding the bones together.

124
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,636
Rym: Well, you got tendons holding the bones.

125
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:47,740
Scott: It's all the same shit.

126
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:48,885
Rym: No, it's not.

127
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,820
Scott: you got flesh holding bones together, yeah, there's human.

128
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:58,294
Rym: Otherwise the bones would just sort of fall apart like like the other half of stone to flesh the spell Which is really gross.

129
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:05,860
Scott: if you cast Kellan's that you see in the classroom are held together with screws because without the flesh the bones don't stay together.

130
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:10,020
Scott: Yep, and then the flesh moves and the bones are in there, right?

131
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:18,394
Scott: Yeah, and when you don't move them for a while, you know the muscles sorta, you know Or whatever and the bones get close they're moving around.

132
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:23,019
Scott: so sometimes, you know You'll loosen them up and when you move the muscle the fleshy bits.

133
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:26,454
Scott: Sometimes the bones scrape against each other and go click click.

134
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:32,120
Scott: No, no the reality is That is incorrect, but isn't that a common sense?

135
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,954
Rym: It is a common sentiment and the thing I can say is that it's a common sense answer.

136
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:41,194
Rym: you would but the other common sense Answer is you would fucking know if your bone was scraping against your bone.

137
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,840
Scott: Yeah, I don't know really.

138
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,851
Rym: Yeah, that's a lot of the problems that runners and people get.

139
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:48,100
Scott: isn't that every joint bones are touching bones?

140
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:49,809
Rym: No, actually the like.

141
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,920
Scott: your shoulder is in a socket and it moves.

142
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:53,225
Rym: Yeah There's a total in all the.

143
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:56,660
Rym: there's a joint and tendons and pads and buffers in there.

144
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:59,619
Rym: We have actual bone is scraping against actual bone.

145
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:07,767
Scott: You're in for you're in you're in trouble so that you're telling me that not no zero bones in my body makes No contact whatsoever with any other bone.

146
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:10,334
Scott: There's always just something in between every bone.

147
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:12,540
Rym: There are definitely exceptions to that.

148
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:16,636
Rym: Okay, but generally like the bones you're thinking about there's tendons.

149
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:21,706
Scott: There's cartilage I mean like my my in my shoulder socket moving around.

150
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,148
Rym: Yeah, there's like cartilage around it.

151
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:24,390
Rym: Okay stuff there.

152
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:31,700
Rym: The next most common theory is you get bubbles in your joint and if yep, that's partially true.

153
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:35,280
Rym: Yeah, well you a lot of you some people get always there's fluids and shit.

154
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:43,080
Rym: Yeah, there's fluids and there's bubbles But the bubbles popping is not what causes the sound and apparently this article is fascinating.

155
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:50,720
Rym: the reason why it's so hard to answer this question is The same reason why it's actually hard to answer a lot of questions about the human body.

156
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,987
Rym: There's no way to just video it happening.

157
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:58,058
Rym: Like you can't just make a video x-ray and high enough speed.

158
00:10:58,198 --> 00:10:59,562
Scott: You'll see bones That's it.

159
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:04,380
Rym: You'll see bones and a lot like you and you might say oh, but I can see like the inside of a cell.

160
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:11,170
Rym: Yeah, I like dead died Stabilized cell that was held under a special microscope for a long time.

161
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:21,166
Rym: Yeah live video, especially high-speed live video of fast events inside of things that you did not kill are Almost impossible to get.

162
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:29,659
Rym: and is it even gonna work if you're alive or like, you know, yep So I mean there's a reason if you get an MRI, you're basically strapped in and can't move at all.

163
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:55,796
Rym: So this article talks about how the way they figured this out recently like really recently was by making mathematical models of what those bubbles would look like and then simulating them and then comparing the sound that the simulated bubbles would make when they're interacting with the rest of these joints and bones to Actual recordings of knuckles cracking and looking for matches and all this fancy stuff.

164
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:56,880
Rym: the article goes into detail.

165
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:59,291
Scott: It sounds like bones hitting against each other, right?

166
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:01,822
Rym: Yep, so it ain't even bubbles popping Mm-hmm.

167
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:12,180
Rym: It seems like at least from this data, which is these data, which is pretty new which are pretty new is That it is the cavitation of those bubbles.

168
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,239
Rym: So the bubbles compress and they expand again and that makes the sound they don't pop.

169
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,518
Scott: Oh am I less cracky because I have less gas?

170
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:24,111
Rym: So they don't know any of those other answers.

171
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,237
Rym: Okay, they don't.

172
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:28,970
Scott: they still don't know Why some people can crack like crazy and other people can't.

173
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:30,776
Rym: seems like they don't know that either.

174
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:33,920
Scott: wouldn't it just be because I'm less Gassy, ah, it's hard to say.

175
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,940
Rym: It's also not clear if those gas bubbles have like if they're important or not.

176
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:40,533
Scott: Are they have any connection to arthritis or other joint?

177
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:41,578
Rym: that seems to still be.

178
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,714
Rym: no There's see there doesn't seem to be.

179
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:49,240
Rym: now again This is just based on my like not scientists and I try problems that people have.

180
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:54,140
Rym: It seems like there is no real correlation between knuckle cracking and any negative outcomes.

181
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:58,958
Rym: Okay, so I'm gonna keep cracking my knuckles cuz it feels great and I like the sound.

182
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:02,694
Scott: yeah They can't do it, you know based on the feeling we can't figure anything out.

183
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:03,518
Rym: No, I don't think so.

184
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:07,300
Scott: No, does it feel like gas bubbles are popping when you feel the crack?

185
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,775
Rym: I don't know what it feels like if a gas bubble pops inside of me.

186
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:11,659
Scott: Maybe you do.

187
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:18,977
Rym: I know what it feels like when I'm full of gas in certain specific areas But it doesn't make it sound like that.

188
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:19,862
Scott: no Doesn't.

189
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:28,379
Rym: if they if that area of gas made a sound like that I would be waiting for the ambulance If I wasn't already dead.

190
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,387
Rym: But this is just sort of a fascinating greed.

191
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:40,754
Rym: things that appear to have simple answers or common-sense answers Very often have a complex and ambiguous answer.

192
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:44,246
Rym: That is way Different from what you think.

193
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,610
Scott: Oh, but my Occam's razor.

194
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:45,851
Scott: Why?

195
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,838
Rym: Yeah Occam's razor doesn't always work.

196
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:56,571
Rym: son I cut you with the reason this is relevant and I'll say it because a lot of you might not go to Pax's and you Might not have listened to old episodes of GeekNights.

197
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:57,780
Rym: There's a tradition.

198
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,788
Rym: It doesn't happen at every packs anymore not safe.

199
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:02,800
Rym: The envelope was invented every now and then someone puts it in the envelope.

200
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,680
Rym: I feel like I should ask the question in the envelope for a future packs.

201
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,655
Rym: But occasionally at Pax's in the main theater at the opening ceremonies the

202
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:11,276
Scott: Q&A

203
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:23,500
Rym: will do a thing where Everyone in the audience so like thousands of people Crack their knuckles at the same time and you might think that it couldn't possibly be that loud you crack your own knuckles.

204
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:25,679
Scott: It's not that everyone's quiet and trying to listen.

205
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:32,543
Rym: Yeah but like even if you're and it's indoors if you're in a giant quiet room and like you crack a knuckle like in a football stadium Like how loud could it be?

206
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:41,923
Rym: But when a thousand people all crack their knuckles at the same time It is one of the worst sounds Imaginable.

207
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:42,003
Rym: Mmm.

208
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:43,272
Scott: It's not that bad.

209
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:52,000
Scott: It sounds like Someone being destroyed by horrible magic like what it sounds like a whole bunch of people clapping once.

210
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:55,642
Rym: Nah, it sounds more like squeaky than that I imagine.

211
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:56,144
Rym: it said.

212
00:14:56,224 --> 00:15:01,640
Rym: it sounds like what I imagined the sound was when a certain character in the fifth season was killed by.

213
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,767
Scott: Sounds like a whole bunch of people holding little twigs and then sort of everyone breaks their twig.

214
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:12,321
Rym: No, but it only if the twigs were like Meaty and wet like it has this wet character to it.

215
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,367
Rym: Yeah, it recordings of it.

216
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:18,063
Rym: Don't really do it justice You just have to be in the room physically to see what I mean.

217
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:19,692
Rym: It's a good time It.

218
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:21,022
Rym: it always goes the same way.

219
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:25,386
Rym: they count down Everyone cracks their knuckles and then most of the crowd goes.

220
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:28,919
Rym: Ah Then we all shiver and then we move on.

221
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,069
Scott: I don't I just are like, alright, I don't know.

222
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,035
Rym: good Do you like that sound?

223
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:33,161
Scott: it doesn't bother me.

224
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:34,830
Rym: We should make an album about that sound.

225
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,724
Rym: Okay, so one last little bit of news before we get into the very important main bit.

226
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:45,539
Rym: Scott found this article like 14 minutes ago and I didn't read it.

227
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,643
Scott: I didn't read it either.

228
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:47,306
Scott: Okay.

229
00:15:47,346 --> 00:16:06,343
Rym: Well, there you go but the article is essentially about The idea of active travel and how pretty much Americans in particular But just people in general who live in modern industrialized societies tend not to travel via their own Capable, like they don't bike or walk anywhere.

230
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:19,469
Rym: They drive everywhere Mm-hmm, and the article talks basically from what I skimmed about how the average person Vastly overestimates the time and effort actually required to travel in that manner.

231
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:23,389
Scott: Yeah, you know, I mean if you don't use if you'd never use a car, right?

232
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,349
Scott: Yeah, then you're gonna be pretty bad at estimating how long it takes to get somewhere with a car.

233
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:36,650
Scott: Yeah, if you never use a plane You're not gonna be good as so people who don't walk and don't bike Don't know how long it takes to get places with cars and bikes.

234
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:45,830
Rym: So they literally don't realize with feet and by things like it only takes 15 minutes to walk to that like bodega That's down the street from your neighborhood.

235
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:55,929
Rym: And it's just sort of interesting because we live in New York Which is almost the opposite problem because you're pretty much everyone walks because there's no other way to get to places.

236
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:57,984
Scott: So people who can't walk

237
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:15,406
Rym: yeah Well, yeah, but obviously but I feel like among all the people we know here The real problem is that most people vastly Underestimate how long it takes to walk or take a subway to get somewhere like oh I'll be there in a half hour when it'll guaranteedly take them at least 45 minutes to walk there.

238
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:15,788
Rym: Mm-hmm.

239
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:22,087
Rym: So, I don't know people need to walk and bike more and we really need to ban cars is the only thing I got to Say about this.

240
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,891
Scott: That was good.

241
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:32,099
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

242
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:46,918
Rym: So, uh, I found this YouTube video that was fascinating and it was just this long video showing a machine that Semi automatically knits socks from the main bit.

243
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:53,420
Rym: So I decided to make this my thing of the day before we decided to do the show on socks.

244
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,013
Rym: The fact that this is about socks is literally 100% a coincidence.

245
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:57,836
Rym: There is a connection.

246
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:00,370
Scott: It is only in Rym's brain.

247
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,034
Scott: this connection.

248
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:02,040
Scott: He's denying it exists.

249
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,189
Rym: You know how we decide how to do a Thursday show.

250
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,980
Rym: the uh, so Scott and I will be on G chat.

251
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:15,891
Rym: We're at work on Thursday Usually like Thursday afternoon and one of us will measure the other one show tonight on question mark And then we won't say anything for a while.

252
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:26,473
Rym: What I tend to do is literally look around wherever I happen to be and If anything I can see gives me an idea for a show.

253
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,562
Rym: Those are the things I suggest Like.

254
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:32,979
Scott: I'll look around and I'll be like see you looked around at this YouTube video.

255
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:44,414
Rym: No I looked around and I happen to be wearing green smartwool socks despite the fact that I was wearing black dress shoes because I was out of my Shitty black socks and I actually I wanted to wear my comfortable socks.

256
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:49,156
Rym: So I wore socks I wouldn't normally wear so I was thinking about my socks all day.

257
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:49,678
Rym: Mm-hmm.

258
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:52,740
Rym: And then we're like, oh, let's do a show on socks and it totally worked.

259
00:18:53,122 --> 00:18:54,750
Rym: Never talked about socks before somehow.

260
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:59,828
Rym: But anyway, that video is fascinating But it doesn't explain anything.

261
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:06,286
Rym: So I have this other video that's my thing of the day and it is someone Explaining how these machines work.

262
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:11,600
Rym: These machines are things that were used like a hundred years ago as an early form of mass production.

263
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:18,917
Rym: they were there way way faster than hand knitting and way way slower than the modern machines that make these things.

264
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:32,604
Rym: but it is really fascinating to see in detail how this kind of Purely mechanical machine run driven and run by humans manipulating physical bits Like.

265
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:41,676
Rym: the complexity of what it's accomplishing is pretty pretty amazing Mm-hmm, and this video is like seven minutes long and you'll know everything about how this machine works by the end of it.

266
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:42,538
Rym: Mm-hmm.

267
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:44,125
Rym: So what do you got?

268
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:45,673
Scott: Oh, what do you have?

269
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:46,880
Rym: anything sock related, you know?

270
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,979
Scott: So there was a news today that they're gonna sell a Kirby Automaton which is something just makes sense if you don't know what automaton is.

271
00:19:54,841 --> 00:20:00,420
Scott: It's a cheapo musical instrument of the digital variety and at the bottom is a ball with a slit in it.

272
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:11,125
Scott: The only reason the slit is there is because when you squeeze the ball at the bottom you don't you know It's it's cute that it has the mouth open up and also as the sound comes out of and you can sort of you know More sound will come out of this.

273
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:20,239
Scott: like it's like you cut a tennis ball and you can make a little face and make it Talk, it's like that right except and then coming out The back is a stick and it looks like a musical note.

274
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:28,616
Scott: Right because you got a stick with a ball and a little flag at the top and then you can move your finger up and down The stick, you know, there's a little touch sensitive strip to make the.

275
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:29,400
Scott: you know, the sound go.

276
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:34,764
Scott: We sort of like a slide whistle, but you know, whatever And there's no like.

277
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,532
Scott: as far as I know there's no frets on it.

278
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:36,813
Scott: So it's.

279
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,520
Rym: no it's a hundred percent portamento.

280
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,088
Scott: So it's like a violin where you got it.

281
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:40,611
Scott: You gotta know.

282
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:42,219
Scott: Yeah, you got to feel it out.

283
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:49,828
Rym: Well, it's it's portamento in the sense that if you if you naively play it Notes will just slide into each other.

284
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:54,100
Rym: you could you might say they drift into each other as opposed to.

285
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,720
Scott: Anyway, so they're coming up with a kirby themed on which is obvious.

286
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,900
Scott: It'll be pink and have Kirby's face at the bottom and someone's gonna play.

287
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:08,939
Scott: As soon as they get one, they're gonna play that song, right drop it like it's hot, but no one has that.

288
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:10,492
Scott: yet It's I don't think anyone.

289
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:16,740
Scott: I think you just announced Uh, but because of this, everyone posted all sorts of automatoned videos today.

290
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,522
Rym: Now this ain't new.

291
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:21,458
Rym: I feel like seven months ago there was like a big automatoned like wave.

292
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:26,558
Scott: Probably, but the point is that wave has made a second wave.

293
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,699
Scott: Look, you know, the roller coaster, the big hill, and then the second second hill that's still big.

294
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,864
Scott: That's the second big hill.

295
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:38,180
Scott: So, uh, here is a video of the best automatoned video that I could find.

296
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,260
Rym: This is better than what was hitherto my favorite automatoned video, which was Ave Maria.

297
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:45,216
Scott: Okay.

298
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,684
Rym: This is pretty good.

299
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:57,040
Rym: I debate, I'm still debating whether or not I should get one because in terms of musical complexity- On the one hand, it is a annoying noise-making device, which is a thing that Rym wants.

300
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,699
Rym: Yo, say, say hello to my harmonicas.

301
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:07,371
Scott: On the other hand, we must not allow for the sake of all of our sanity and preventing the end of the world and making, you know, God's too angry.

302
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:09,600
Scott: We must prevent Rym from having any more-.

303
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:18,620
Rym: Just warning you, what I think is going to happen is I might bring one of these to say MagFest, and I feel like- That's an appropriate place to have one.

304
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:25,280
Rym: I feel like a lot of other nerds are going to bring the Kirby one specifically to the next MagFest.

305
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:34,080
Rym: Are you going to go to a jam space with your automaton and- I feel like there's going to be an automaton specific jam space event at the next MagFest.

306
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,392
Rym: This is a prediction.

307
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:36,260
Rym: I feel like this is going to happen.

308
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,419
Scott: I should make a double automaton.

309
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,182
Scott: Ooh.

310
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,559
Scott: There's still one face at the bottom, but there's daddy two sticks.

311
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,171
Scott: The barrier to entry.

312
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:49,679
Rym: on playing an automaton, it's like a theremin, but way easier coupled with a kazoo.

313
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:52,352
Scott: Also way cheaper.

314
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,439
Scott: You can just get one of these.

315
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,020
Rym: Yup.

316
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:58,700
Rym: Like it costs less to buy one of these than to buy an okay harmonica.

317
00:22:59,521 --> 00:22:59,602
Scott: Yeah.

318
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:02,840
Scott: And you know, musical instruments that are real are actually kind of expensive.

319
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:03,322
Rym: Yup.

320
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:10,259
Rym: Now I feel like maybe I'll just start playing my harmonic again because that is sufficiently annoying and I already- It's sufficiently annoying.

321
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,319
Scott: He admits his goal is to produce annoying sounds.

322
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:26,040
Rym: Well, because playing my trumpet is too much investment like physically, but playing like harmonicas or this kind of thing doesn't really require me to stay in a good physical shape vis-a-vis my lungs and lips and tongue.

323
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:28,120
Rym: I can kind of just play them whenever I want.

324
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,512
Rym: Like I'll be just as good at them if I don't play them for a month as if I play them every day.

325
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:34,659
Rym: My skill level won't change.

326
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:41,974
Rym: In the meantime, the Book Club book remains Emily Wilson's modern translation of Homer's Odyssey.

327
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:46,137
Scott: The- I'm still reading it on the pooper in the train and you know what?

328
00:23:46,317 --> 00:23:48,345
Scott: The Odyssey, you know, it's an epic.

329
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:49,834
Scott: It's the Odyssey.

330
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:51,966
Rym: Yeah.

331
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:52,954
Rym: The word Odyssey.

332
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:53,579
Rym: Odysseus.

333
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,252
Scott: It makes it seem real big, but you know what?

334
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:56,834
Scott: It's not so big.

335
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:57,860
Scott: This book is going by fast.

336
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:58,262
Scott: Yeah.

337
00:23:58,442 --> 00:23:58,945
Rym: I told you.

338
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:02,945
Rym: I mean, it starts with Telemachus being like, oh shit.

339
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:04,720
Scott: I'm already like book four or five or something.

340
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,384
Rym: Oh shit.

341
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,310
Rym: Where's my dad?

342
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:12,629
Rym: And Athena being like, yo, I'm going to make you a man and you're going to have a crush on me, but that's not going to matter.

343
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:14,139
Rym: And then I'm going to help your dad.

344
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:16,799
Rym: And then we're going to kill a whole bunch of people at the end.

345
00:24:18,363 --> 00:24:19,900
Scott: I'm hanging with King Nestor.

346
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,867
Rym: Oh, the Nestor.

347
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:24,760
Rym: I didn't remember all the details of King Nestor.

348
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,387
Rym: I love how he never fucking shuts up.

349
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:37,520
Rym: Like Nestor is, it's not my favorite character, but if there was a, if there was a good movie version of the Odyssey, I feel like he would be the funniest character.

350
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,225
Scott: I think we're next.

351
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:39,880
Scott: We're going to go check out Menelaus.

352
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:41,062
Rym: Yup.

353
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:46,099
Rym: You're going to go to Menelaus and then you're going to cut back to what Odysseus is up to with Calypso.

354
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,520
Scott: And being sad, even though he's banging the god lady.

355
00:24:51,681 --> 00:25:00,878
Rym: I still like the idea that the implication is eventually he's too sad and wants to go home, but he does just go and have sex with her literally every night.

356
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,019
Scott: Why wouldn't you?

357
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,840
Rym: The opening scene is like, he's like, oh, I want to go home.

358
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,108
Rym: And she's like, well, you can't anyway.

359
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:12,539
Scott: It's about 5 p.m So, uh, I'm like, I'm also like the hottest guy.

360
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:18,560
Rym: I mean, it's telling when, uh, uh, Mercury comes or Hermes.

361
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:20,539
Scott: Mercury is his Roman.

362
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:20,941
Rym: Yeah.

363
00:25:21,182 --> 00:25:25,960
Rym: When Hermes comes to tell Calypso, yo, you've got to let Odysseus go.

364
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:29,220
Rym: Even he is like, wow, she is beautiful.

365
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,062
Rym: Wow.

366
00:25:30,123 --> 00:25:31,372
Rym: This island is a paradise.

367
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,320
Rym: Holy shit.

368
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:33,466
Rym: I'm impressed.

369
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,280
Rym: And I literally just came here from Olympus.

370
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,121
Scott: Yeah.

371
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,580
Scott: Why doesn't, uh, Hermes get it on with Calypso?

372
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,618
Scott: I feel like.

373
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:42,800
Scott: Why does it, why does Calypso want Odysseus?

374
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,679
Rym: I feel like Calypso doesn't particularly like Hermes or Zeus or really any of them.

375
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:50,099
Scott: Why did you like Odysseus?

376
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,767
Rym: Uh, they get into that the same reason.

377
00:25:52,848 --> 00:26:07,240
Rym: Athena and Zeus like Odysseus, because of all the humans, he's kind of the smartest one, but in quotes, because he's smart, the way they like people to be meaning lying all the time to everyone about everything.

378
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,035
Scott: God's just decided he shall be the protagonist.

379
00:26:10,075 --> 00:26:10,699
Scott: Therefore he is.

380
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,629
Rym: I mean, the book opens with literally Athena's like, yo, you can help Odysseus out.

381
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:16,000
Rym: And Zeus is like, oh, right.

382
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:16,603
Rym: Odysseus.

383
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:16,865
Rym: Yeah.

384
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:17,894
Rym: He's pretty cool.

385
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:18,519
Rym: I like him.

386
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:19,952
Rym: But he pissed off Poseidon.

387
00:26:19,972 --> 00:26:20,679
Rym: What do you want me to do?

388
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:22,286
Scott: Oh, my boy, Poseidon.

389
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:23,813
Scott: What's up?

390
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:27,600
Scott: I like how, uh, King Nestor, he'd be sacrificing to Poseidon because he knows.

391
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,580
Rym: Because nobody likes Poseidon.

392
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:29,957
Scott: I do.

393
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,340
Rym: No, no one does.

394
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:31,979
Scott: Scott does.

395
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:35,598
Rym: You, you avoid pissing Poseidon off.

396
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,566
Rym: Yes.

397
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:37,459
Scott: Because he's awesome.

398
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,078
Rym: Yes.

399
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:40,500
Scott: You should avoid pissing Scott off the same way.

400
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,760
Rym: Poseidon is awesome.

401
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,839
Scott: So don't make annoying noises.

402
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,440
Rym: And everyone will say that he is awesome because you don't want to piss him off.

403
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:47,000
Scott: Anyway.

404
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:54,940
Rym: But yes, we will be very soon at the Penny Arcade Expo East in Boston.

405
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:57,319
Rym: It is four days long.

406
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,860
Rym: We're going to be there on Wednesday and there is official gaming on Wednesday.

407
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:03,038
Rym: It's five days long.

408
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,180
Rym: So we will be there and it's going to be awesome.

409
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:14,659
Rym: If you want to find us and play games, we're pretty much going to be in tabletop morning and afternoon every day.

410
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:21,720
Rym: Except on Sunday morning, we're going to be doing, uh, the final full version of our 40 tabletop games.

411
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,800
Rym: You must play panel at 10 30 AM in the arachnid theater.

412
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:33,700
Scott: Also, if you're listening to this right now, it's probably too late, but anime Boston that we used to go to, but no longer go to is like tomorrow.

413
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:45,140
Rym: And I do want to say, or today for most of you, us not going to anime Boston for a few years should not convince you not to go because you're near it and you like anime.

414
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,666
Scott: Go to it is the best anime con on the Eastern Seaboard.

415
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:54,579
Rym: Like there is these days.

416
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,719
Rym: I haven't been, I mean, I hear things.

417
00:27:57,004 --> 00:27:57,718
Rym: It's hard to say.

418
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:01,440
Rym: Like it's hard to tell what these definitely past its peak is the thing.

419
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:02,377
Scott: So it's like, I don't know.

420
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:08,100
Rym: But having been to much more recent anime Bostons, it's got everything you want out of an anime.

421
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:10,374
Scott: You want to go to anime con is worth going to.

422
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:11,159
Rym: the panels are.

423
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:13,379
Scott: NYC is too new for me to judge.

424
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,540
Rym: But you heard me saying the panels and anime Boston.

425
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:18,340
Rym: There are good panels there.

426
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,635
Rym: I barely even say that about packs is also a real good.

427
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:22,620
Scott: Japanese guests there.

428
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:23,140
Scott: Yeah.

429
00:28:23,381 --> 00:28:26,140
Rym: Like if you want to see legit guests, good artists alley there.

430
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:26,578
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:28,700
Rym: And there's great food like right there.

432
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,239
Rym: Like anime Boston has got a lot going on.

433
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:37,320
Rym: The only reason we are not there is that we go to four between four and six packs as a year and magfest.

434
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,499
Rym: And it's hard to go to more than 10 conventions a year.

435
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:49,417
Scott: Also, we gotta be doing some, uh, anime judging for the, uh, spring, whatever season is next real soon.

436
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:50,020
Rym: Yep.

437
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,587
Rym: So what would be on the lookout for?

438
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:57,820
Rym: our GeekNights presents utenna show, which is continuing, uh, the GeekNights judges anime by its cover, which is continuing.

439
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,800
Rym: All that stuff is coming.

440
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,620
Scott: There's a new season.

441
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,156
Scott: We got judge.

442
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:09,400
Rym: And if you want to actually find us and see us at PAX East, it's actually really hard to find us in tabletop because east is an enormous convention.

443
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,919
Rym: It's the biggest packs.

444
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,160
Scott: And it's at least it's all one building at west.

445
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,300
Scott: It's like you could be in any building.

446
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,096
Scott: You don't know where someone is.

447
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,240
Rym: Well, you know where we are.

448
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,080
Rym: There's only two buildings with tabletop in them.

449
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,700
Scott: I'm just saying at east, you know, it's, it's one building.

450
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:23,420
Rym: East we say, Oh, I'm in tabletop.

451
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,557
Rym: That literally doesn't help.

452
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,877
Scott: Yeah, you can find them.

453
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,719
Rym: You can't find us, but coming to our panel is the only guaranteed way to find us.

454
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:35,060
Rym: Just saying so socks.

455
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:36,799
Rym: Let's talk about socks.

456
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,979
Scott: You put them on your feet because it's cold.

457
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,159
Rym: So there are two kinds of socks.

458
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:42,200
Rym: Well, there's three kinds.

459
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,579
Scott: There's four more than three guys for a, then there's five.

460
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:46,698
Scott: There's many kinds.

461
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,540
Rym: So five socks.

462
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,208
Rym: Five is from RFC 1928, which extends the socks.

463
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,560
Scott: So the first thing I got to say, holy shit socks.

464
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:57,519
Rym: Five supports IPV six.

465
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:12,160
Scott: The first thing I got to say, okay, I'm not going to is that if it's warm out and you got sneakers, no socks is maximum comfiness, but the problem your S your feet and your shoes will smell like death forever permanently.

466
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,039
Scott: Yes, that is the old.

467
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,200
Scott: So that is like the worst.

468
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:24,299
Rym: So there's a second worst there that I have found that if you go barefoot and you do sports, you will get blisters even if you have really comfortable shoes.

469
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:26,680
Scott: Also, you'll probably get foot fungus.

470
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,539
Rym: Yeah, you're, you're gonna have a lot of trouble.

471
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:34,474
Rym: Same reason why if you never wear underwear, uh, you're gonna have trouble with the jeans, son.

472
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,460
Rym: Just saying, just saying.

473
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:46,840
Scott: So, uh, therefore I found that in the summer when it's warm and when I'm wearing sneakers, I have discovered that I prefer the most minimal sock possible.

474
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:48,446
Rym: I was at work.

475
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:52,160
Scott: that only covers the bottom of the foot and the back as a little rubbery bit.

476
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:54,039
Scott: So it stays on at the heel, the no-shows.

477
00:30:54,702 --> 00:30:58,340
Scott: And then when you put your sneaker on, you can't even know that I'm wearing a sock.

478
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,760
Scott: And then it's basically almost as comfy as not wearing any socks.

479
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,280
Rym: So my UX team at work, actually, they were going out to like to have drinks and hang out and celebrate something today.

480
00:31:07,684 --> 00:31:08,660
Rym: And they were like, oh, you should come.

481
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,380
Rym: And I only didn't come because I was coming here to do this.

482
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,598
Rym: I was like, oh no, I get to do the show.

483
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:14,540
Rym: And they were like, oh, what are you doing the show on?

484
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:15,820
Rym: And I was like socks.

485
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:20,720
Rym: The immediate reaction was the conversation we're having immediately.

486
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:23,060
Rym: They were like, oh yeah, I'm all about the smart wool.

487
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:25,100
Rym: And someone else is like, no, no, you got to get the no-shows.

488
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:28,780
Rym: And everyone like took their shoes off and socks happened.

489
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,100
Rym: The no-shows are really popular lately.

490
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,793
Scott: So the ones I found, so I've researched them.

491
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,840
Rym: Why do you care if they show or not?

492
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,519
Scott: It's not about the showing.

493
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,700
Scott: It's about the fact, like I just said, having no sock is maximum comfort.

494
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,020
Scott: So you're getting as close to no sock as possible.

495
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,299
Rym: Ah, the minimal sock.

496
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:49,979
Scott: That's the same reason I wear toe shoes.

497
00:31:50,140 --> 00:32:04,778
Scott: While also still gaining all the benefits of sock of avoiding the fungus, avoiding the smell, avoiding the, you're basically getting all the benefits of sock with the least amount of socks when it's warm and you don't need the sock to warm your foot and you're wearing a comfy shoe and such and

498
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:04,920
Rym: such.

499
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:12,359
Rym: I do point out that there is a very specific use case between like maximum comfort, barefoot, and you're trying to be as close to that as possible is one thing.

500
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:17,760
Rym: But one thing you don't do is endurance sports, like running.

501
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:26,900
Rym: When you're running, you actually need the sock for a specific thing where barefoot would be objectively worse, even if you, even if you ignored the fungus in the smell.

502
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:30,520
Rym: And the problem is it'll get wet and sweaty and lead to blisters.

503
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,159
Rym: And like the wetness will be a problem.

504
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:40,360
Rym: Good quality socks, even the no-shows provide the wicking effect to keep your foot nice and dry when you're running like 10 miles.

505
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:46,340
Rym: It also provides a tiny bit of padding to prevent like chafing.

506
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:52,760
Rym: Like you don't want your toes to chafe because when you're just walking somewhere, you're not like rubbing your toe against the front of your shoe.

507
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,240
Rym: But when you're running, you're rubbing your toe against the shoe because you're hitting the ground hard with every step.

508
00:32:58,502 --> 00:33:00,340
Rym: And your foot has a lot more movement.

509
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,060
Rym: Even if you've tied your shoes, you should be the wrong size.

510
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Rym: If your toe is hitting the, uh, no, even, even if there's buffer in the front, like your foot's going to move a little bit, you might hit the ground hard.

511
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,818
Rym: There's no shoe.

512
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:12,820
Scott: Anyway, it's perfect.

513
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,540
Scott: So as for the showing part, right?

514
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,138
Scott: It's, you know, depending on the pants you're wearing and the shoe you're wearing, right?

515
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:25,880
Scott: The amount of showing and the style of showing could be cool and or dorky.

516
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:45,740
Rym: Well, case in point, I see a lot of people, like a lot of people and it kind of, it kind of bothers me when people have pants that are a little too short and they're wearing socks that show like a crew sock size, but the pain when they sit down, you see bare leg above a tall sock.

517
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,536
Scott: That's me right now.

518
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:48,779
Scott: That is bad news because I'm sitting down.

519
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:57,900
Rym: But if you show bare leg because you're wearing no shows, that's, that feels more like that seems more socially acceptable and more like this hipster style.

520
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,167
Scott: That real, I don't like.

521
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:04,520
Scott: where you're wearing like, you know, like the dress sock with the designs on the side or whatever, like the diamonds and shit.

522
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,760
Rym: With that, the argyle sock, it's all cover.

523
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:07,939
Scott: It's all colored and shit.

524
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:16,119
Scott: But when that, when someone's wearing that, I like that, but the, it doesn't go and the length is wrong and it's sort of like, well, that's it.

525
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:20,940
Scott: Sort of like this awkward hipster, you know, situation.

526
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:30,320
Rym: If you're wearing the sock that has stuff on it, but the, there's a gap between the top of the sock and the bottom of your pants.

527
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:31,578
Rym: You fucked up, son.

528
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:40,819
Rym: But yeah, as long as they're properly sizing most people, their pants are the wrong size and I don't know why this is such a common problem to be honest.

529
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:45,759
Rym: But in terms, I guess, so I have, I'll go straight in.

530
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:54,739
Rym: I used to, when I was in like RIT, I would buy big old bags of just Hanes cotton socks, like as many as possible.

531
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,140
Scott: I would buy bags, bags of white socks and then.

532
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,100
Rym: And bags of black socks.

533
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:00,239
Scott: And when they got, oh, I didn't do that.

534
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,599
Rym: And then when they went bad, I had to dress up a lot for my work.

535
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,359
Scott: When they went bad, I would get rid of them and replace them again.

536
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:05,804
Rym: Yup.

537
00:35:06,363 --> 00:35:07,118
Scott: And that was all I did.

538
00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:12,000
Rym: But the problem, and the only, the main reason I bought them in bulk was one, I was poor.

539
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,839
Rym: Like that, that's a valid reason.

540
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,740
Scott: Cause I didn't care.

541
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,436
Rym: Yeah.

542
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:16,199
Rym: Two, I didn't care.

543
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,240
Rym: And three, I didn't know better.

544
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,958
Rym: Like I didn't know.

545
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,160
Scott: Also even like El cheapo, you know, generic white socks are way comfy when they're new.

546
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,939
Scott: It's like, wow, these are great.

547
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,240
Rym: Yeah.

548
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,300
Rym: But as they get old, they get like, they become negative comfort.

549
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,592
Rym: Yes.

550
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,899
Scott: They're a little scratchy and stiff.

551
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:42,040
Rym: But I also didn't really, I didn't know like in high school and even like in the early years of RIT, that there were kinds of socks that were objectively better in structural ways or materials that like, I didn't know.

552
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:44,680
Scott: I went to the store, there was a bag of white socks and I was like, hell yeah.

553
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,400
Rym: And then next to them, I'd see one pair of socks that cost the same as the whole bag.

554
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:48,625
Rym: Yeah.

555
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:55,160
Rym: And more importantly, same, I did the same thing with underwear and t-shirts in college.

556
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,640
Rym: My main, one of my main goals in life was to do laundry as few times as possible.

557
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:07,420
Rym: So buying more socks, man, I could go longer before I had to do a unit of laundry.

558
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,555
Rym: And then I do a little, I'd literally take all my socks and wash them all at once and put them right in the dryer.

559
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:16,820
Rym: But yeah, those socks suck.

560
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:17,560
Rym: And now I know better.

561
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,776
Rym: So nowadays I probably, I actually have a bunch of different kinds of socks for different contexts.

562
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:26,520
Rym: So on one hand I threw away on my old shitty side.

563
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:27,579
Scott: I just change them with the weather.

564
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:33,640
Rym: So I do buy black cotton crew socks in bulk still.

565
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,120
Rym: I have a big old bag of like Hanes equivalent, just black socks.

566
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,579
Rym: And the reason for that is black and nondescript socks are what I generally like.

567
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:44,739
Rym: They're the safest thing to wear at work.

568
00:36:45,985 --> 00:36:46,957
Rym: Just the way I dress at work.

569
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:52,060
Rym: They don't in any way interfere with anything I would wear at work in any context.

570
00:36:53,082 --> 00:37:03,236
Rym: And I can throw them away as soon as they start to wear out and replace them and never worry about it without wearing out my actually really expensive socks by wearing them every single day.

571
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:09,060
Rym: So I have these like shitty socks that I wear when it doesn't matter and I buy them in bulk.

572
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,199
Rym: I throw them away when there's even a hint of trouble and just buy them in bulk again.

573
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:16,540
Rym: But then I have my running socks.

574
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,500
Rym: They're not no shows because actually I have a problem when I run.

575
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:32,199
Rym: If I wear the completely minimalist socks that you don't even see the top of my foot, like my ankle area, like the bottom of the ankle will interact with the top of my shoe and cause chafing.

576
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:36,159
Rym: If I run long distances, I need a sock that at least gets above the ankle.

577
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:37,979
Rym: So I have ankle socks.

578
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:39,240
Rym: They're all smart wool.

579
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,379
Rym: I buy this one particular smart will sock.

580
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:45,260
Rym: That is like the perfect long distance running smartwool.

581
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,840
Scott: Smartwool is a brand like TM Smartwool.

582
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:48,700
Scott: You can get anything.

583
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,560
Rym: You can get any smartwool equivalent, right?

584
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,340
Scott: It's like, but the actual smartwool brand costs a fucking fortune.

585
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:54,298
Scott: You can buy it.

586
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,900
Scott: Like for example, when it gets cold, I wear like big fancy wool socks, right?

587
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:01,260
Scott: And I bought them in bulk on Amazon, but they're high quality.

588
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:06,080
Scott: But the brand is like people socks, but they're the exact same thing as smartwool socks.

589
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:08,439
Rym: It is the way it makes really good ones too.

590
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,820
Scott: There's tons of them you can get.

591
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:11,020
Scott: They're all pretty great.

592
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,540
Scott: They're real.

593
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,460
Scott: You know, they're really meant for like wearing big boots and hiking in the woods, but they keep your feet so warm and toasty and they're so nice and comfy.

594
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:20,759
Scott: If it's cold out, why not wear them?

595
00:38:21,905 --> 00:38:25,140
Rym: So I have smartwool socks that are like crew length that I'll wear.

596
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,919
Rym: Like if I'm not at work, like if I'm hanging out on the weekend, I'll wear those kinds of socks with my comfortable shoes.

597
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,100
Rym: But, or like at a packs, like those are the best things to wear at a pack.

598
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,560
Scott: So you can, you can also just wear them without any shoes if you're in the house or whatever.

599
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:40,059
Scott: Cause it's almost a slipper.

600
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:40,977
Scott: Almost.

601
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,313
Rym: Yeah.

602
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,400
Rym: It does wear them out faster though.

603
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,360
Rym: You're going to wear out the bottoms.

604
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:46,996
Scott: You mean you put your slippers on if you got them, but you know, you, you know, they're still comfy.

605
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:47,394
Rym: Yep.

606
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,659
Scott: You can wear them while you're sleeping to keep your feet warm.

607
00:38:49,921 --> 00:38:59,360
Rym: Then when I'm doing shorter runs or like high speed runs, like I'm running a 5k instead of the smart wool ankle socks, I wear the like super middle.

608
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,600
Rym: They're basically like spandex no-shows.

609
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,840
Rym: They're kind of, they're made out of various materials.

610
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,654
Rym: They're like super sporty.

611
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:08,020
Rym: Their sole goal is to protect my foot, wick sweat away.

612
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:10,679
Rym: And I wear those for like short runs.

613
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:18,719
Rym: And then I have a whole bunch of winter socks that might be smartwool or other brands, but those are like the ones that go all the way up my leg.

614
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,059
Rym: They're like super warm.

615
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,060
Rym: They're super expensive relative to socks.

616
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:31,680
Rym: I only wear them when I have a good reason to like, I'm going skiing or I'm going to be walking outside in New York a lot on this day.

617
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,499
Rym: That's really cold.

618
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:36,599
Rym: Or I'm at PAX East because fuck the weather in Boston during PAX East.

619
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:44,159
Scott: My sock drawer actually right now is full of the previous generation of socks I have to get rid of, which I don't wear.

620
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:44,654
Scott: Right.

621
00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:49,040
Scott: It's full of the no-showing socks, right?

622
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,870
Scott: It's full of the wool, the big wintery warm socks.

623
00:39:55,482 --> 00:40:01,800
Scott: I have two pairs of socks that are just for bicycling because they're warm, but they are also thinner.

624
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:05,700
Scott: I couldn't wear the big thick wool socks in a bicycle shoe.

625
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,980
Rym: If it's summer, I wear those no-show minimalist ones on my bike shoes.

626
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,780
Rym: And if it's cold out, I just wear my smartwools.

627
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:23,018
Scott: And then I have one dress sock of each color in case there is a dress occasion, which there hardly ever is.

628
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:32,979
Rym: So because of the nature of the dress, when I wear dress clothes, like formal attire, I tend to do traditional black suits.

629
00:40:34,502 --> 00:40:37,940
Rym: And I tend to have a slightly longer leg cut on my dress pants on purpose.

630
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:42,800
Rym: So I tend to actually use my shitty black socks because no one can tell.

631
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:47,240
Rym: Like I don't have, I do not have proper dress socks currently.

632
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,320
Scott: I just have one pair of every, you know, one black, one brown, one blue, one, you know.

633
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:53,518
Scott: I do not have an occasion.

634
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,640
Rym: I have no formal outfit that would require a non-black dress sock.

635
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:01,980
Scott: I think my suit is blue and my shoe is brown.

636
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,600
Scott: So they usually use the blue sock, but I can switch it up.

637
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,760
Rym: Well, usually I'm wearing like a jacket.

638
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,914
Rym: Like I'm wearing like more business casual or like pre-formal wear.

639
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:13,119
Scott: The point is it never hurts to have, right?

640
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,240
Scott: Just one of each just covers any possible scenario.

641
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,020
Scott: You don't, cause you know, what ends up happening is if you don't have that, you know, there's that like, Oh no, I got to go to a thing.

642
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:23,500
Scott: And you go to the store and I had to buy a sock.

643
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:25,800
Scott: I never had to do that because I have one of everything.

644
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:34,939
Rym: It also, I do need a new like set of dress socks because the deal with the dress sock is that unlike say the cheapo black socks I have, the dress sock will still look black.

645
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:37,019
Rym: Like the color will be good.

646
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:38,399
Rym: So no one will notice it.

647
00:41:38,942 --> 00:41:43,514
Rym: Someone who pays attention to the fashion will notice if they see your shitty sock, but normal people don't.

648
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:52,400
Rym: But two, if your dress pants are not perfectly fitted, you need to make sure the dress sock is tall enough to make sure you never show any skin.

649
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,680
Rym: You cannot show skin with formal dress pants.

650
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:02,120
Scott: The other important thing is that like, you know, you get a tall sock, you got to make sure it's nice and tight against your leg.

651
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,260
Scott: Oh, it can't roll down.

652
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:07,400
Scott: If it sags or rolls down, you're going to be pulling it up all the time.

653
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:12,999
Rym: Or you're going to give up and then you're going to maintain that elasticity.

654
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,359
Scott: A sock that gets pushed down a whole bunch or falls down is no good.

655
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,400
Rym: So I have one more kind of sock actually.

656
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,740
Rym: And I did recently, I actually bought a bunch of metal bins and I filled my sock drawer with them to separate all my kinds of socks.

657
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,500
Rym: So I never have to fumble because I got a bunch of different kinds of socks.

658
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,900
Rym: But, uh, so I have toe socks.

659
00:42:32,544 --> 00:42:33,260
Rym: They're all minimalist.

660
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,980
Scott: They're all like, oh, for your toe shoes.

661
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:41,180
Rym: I got the toe shoe, but actually toe sock real comfortable inside of regular shoe.

662
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,859
Scott: Well, because I mean, yeah, you got something in between your toes, right?

663
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,719
Scott: You know, scratching that bit in between there where the web is.

664
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,640
Rym: Which feels good, which is interesting because full disclosure, when I was a kid, like elementary school, I had two weird hangups.

665
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:58,099
Rym: If I, if my sock got wet at any point, it has to go.

666
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:58,659
Scott: Well, okay.

667
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,600
Scott: So I think everyone has this hang up.

668
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,080
Scott: I got, I can't deny if I'm wearing a wet sock.

669
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:04,280
Scott: That is awful.

670
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:10,099
Rym: When I was a kid, like if I was getting dressed for school and I stepped in some water in the bathroom in my sock, I took the sock off new sock.

671
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,660
Scott: But some people, you know, obviously I think, I don't know anyone who likes a wet sock.

672
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,860
Scott: I'm sure there's someone, right?

673
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,358
Scott: But most people, I think when their sock is wet or like, oh, this is really uncomfortable and awful.

674
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,100
Scott: Right.

675
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:27,560
Scott: But, uh, there are some people like you and other people I've known where if the sock gets wet, it's beyond awful.

676
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,340
Scott: Like they're like, oh my God is the worst thing.

677
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,420
Rym: I was only like that.

678
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,860
Rym: However, in elementary school and nowadays it's more like, uh, my sock is wet.

679
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,498
Scott: For me, I just go and I get rid of it as quickly as possible, but I don't like freaking freak out.

680
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:44,840
Rym: But I, well, but it's more like if I, like, even if I'm rushing out the door and I step into some water, I don't replace the sock.

681
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,960
Rym: I just, this too shall pass.

682
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:49,700
Rym: And then I go about my day cause it'll dry soon enough.

683
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:51,400
Rym: That's the advantage though.

684
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,299
Scott: You can get some, you know, then you get stinkies and funguses if you do that.

685
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,139
Rym: Well, if it gets that wet, then yeah, if I like step in the toilet, of course I'm replacing the sock.

686
00:43:59,523 --> 00:44:01,619
Rym: I like spill an entire glass of water on my foot.

687
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:08,640
Rym: But if you wear the fancy socks, like the sports socks, it doesn't matter if they get wet, they like dry immediately.

688
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:09,457
Scott: No, some of them.

689
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,260
Rym: The good ones.

690
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,880
Rym: Like, so one time we went to anime Boston, right?

691
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,599
Rym: And I was wearing my toe shoes and I was wearing some, uh, fancy sport, like wicking socks, like toe socks.

692
00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:22,159
Rym: I forgot to actually pack socks for the trip.

693
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:25,459
Rym: So for three days in Boston, I only had one pair of socks.

694
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:31,659
Rym: So every night when we got from, when he came in from the con, I took the socks, I just washed them in the sink.

695
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,900
Rym: Like it went with my hands and a tiny bit of soap.

696
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:40,659
Rym: And then I just left them out and they were always dry by morning because they were fancy modern wicking socks.

697
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:43,760
Rym: If those had been cotton socks, I would have been fucked.

698
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,876
Rym: I would have had to go buy socks.

699
00:44:46,342 --> 00:44:47,920
Rym: Cotton socks have a lot of problems.

700
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,918
Rym: Like you were better off having synthetic, uh, Merino wool or a combination of synthetic and Merino wool.

701
00:44:55,101 --> 00:44:56,420
Scott: Here's the thing about cotton, right?

702
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,620
Scott: And it counts not just for socks, but for all clothes.

703
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,738
Rym: There's an entire Seinfeld episode about this.

704
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:06,480
Scott: Is that cotton clothing is way comfortable and way inexpensive and it can be way nice, right?

705
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,020
Scott: But it's only good for sedentary, dry activities.

706
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:14,719
Scott: Also good if you're going to get set on fire somehow.

707
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:21,879
Rym: Real good for like firemen, not pajamas you're going to wear to bed necessarily, but pajamas you walk around the house with.

708
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:24,880
Scott: But any other activity, right?

709
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,540
Scott: Cotton is not so good.

710
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:28,620
Scott: If you're doing anything athletic, right?

711
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,379
Rym: If it gets wet, it's not going to dry.

712
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:30,760
Scott: Yeah.

713
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,560
Scott: You'll melt inside of it and it doesn't block the wind.

714
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:33,724
Rym: Right.

715
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,139
Rym: It doesn't wick sweat away so much as concentrated in your armpits.

716
00:45:38,564 --> 00:45:39,260
Scott: It's not proof.

717
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,820
Scott: It doesn't protect you from the rain.

718
00:45:41,244 --> 00:45:42,940
Scott: It's like it turns into sandpaper.

719
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:51,080
Scott: It's basically the worst possible fabric material for actually doing stuff and the best for laying, lazing about.

720
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:55,920
Scott: Most people laze about all the time and the cotton can work for all their clothes.

721
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:04,080
Scott: But if you do any activity whatsoever involving the environment or athleticism, then you want zero percent cotton.

722
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:04,837
Scott: Cotton is the worst.

723
00:46:05,189 --> 00:46:05,358
Rym: Yup.

724
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,757
Scott: And that's pretty much it.

725
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:10,479
Rym: But yeah, I watched those toe socks.

726
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,520
Rym: They just dried immediately.

727
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,959
Rym: But I have a whole bunch of toe socks.

728
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,320
Rym: There's one real annoying thing about toe socks.

729
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:19,100
Rym: Left and right matter because they're different.

730
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:24,460
Rym: So you can't just have a bin of 30 identical socks and just pull two out of it.

731
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:27,079
Rym: You got to get a left one and a right one.

732
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,560
Rym: And for a while, I tried to separate left and right and two separate bins.

733
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,040
Scott: What if one person has long toes and one person has short toes?

734
00:46:34,022 --> 00:46:39,499
Rym: That usually doesn't matter because actually I have a freakishly long middle toe and it just doesn't matter because they stretch a little bit.

735
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,818
Rym: No one makes shady toe socks really for sports.

736
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:45,354
Rym: They're all fancy.

737
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:48,760
Rym: And EG makes them and Smartwool, that kind of stuff.

738
00:46:49,221 --> 00:46:49,839
Rym: So they just work.

739
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:50,336
Rym: They fit.

740
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,680
Rym: But I tried separating left and right and that was not tenable.

741
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,780
Rym: So what I did instead is every single toe sock I buy is a different color.

742
00:47:04,982 --> 00:47:07,280
Rym: So every pair is absolutely unique.

743
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,978
Rym: So I just have to find the pair as opposed to finding the one with the L on it and then finding the one with the R on it.

744
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:16,619
Rym: Or even worse, the shitty brands that don't label them.

745
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,760
Rym: So you got to dig through and be like, is this a left?

746
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,639
Rym: Is this a right?

747
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,199
Rym: Whoa betide, you bring four left socks on your trip.

748
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:32,820
Rym: Granted, actually my fancy ski socks also have a left and right despite the no toes because they're sort of like they're set to fit your foot very particularly.

749
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,640
Rym: But that's sort of a weird edge case.

750
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,699
Rym: That's like specialty sports equipment more so than sock.

751
00:47:40,243 --> 00:47:42,580
Rym: Yeah, I guess I didn't think a lot about socks in high school.

752
00:47:43,143 --> 00:47:46,520
Rym: And I think a lot more about socks now that I'm older.

753
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,960
Rym: And apparently on this Wikipedia page, there are special specific socks just for flip flops.

754
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:54,506
Scott: No.

755
00:47:55,321 --> 00:47:56,740
Scott: Yeah, no.

756
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,600
Scott: Flip flops if you should never wear them, but if you do, no socks.

757
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:08,180
Rym: The whole point of a flip flop is that they are the minimum barrier to entry between barefoot and something on your foot.

758
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:16,220
Rym: If you do anything to increase the complexity of that arrangement, you have already ruined the sole reason to wear flip flops in the first place.

759
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:26,260
Rym: The whole point of a flip flop is you literally want there to be less than a second between not wearing shoes and technically wearing the barest minimum legal definition of shoes.

760
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:27,818
Scott: That's right.

761
00:48:28,962 --> 00:48:29,158
Rym: All right.

762
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,278
Rym: I think we killed enough time with this.

763
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,600
Rym: Share your sock comments in the forum.

764
00:48:33,783 --> 00:48:34,620
Rym: Like and subscribe.

765
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:35,579
Scott: No, don't.

766
00:48:41,162 --> 00:48:43,300
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

767
00:48:43,441 --> 00:48:48,419
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

768

769
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,760
